CHAPTER I. MRS. HOBBS AND LITTLE MARTHA. The stretch of sea-sands at Dinglemouth offered the usual spectacle which such a scene presents .on a fine summer evening. Dinglemouth was a watering-place, not a seaport. Even as a watering-place its claims to importance were not extensive. It was not large or convenient as the goal of a run down from London, or from any great manufacturing centre. It had no preten- sion to be an antique, therefore it had no historic re- mains good for filling half-a-dozen pages of a local guide- book. It was not picturesque to speak of. It could not boast of any speciality in the shape of fish or crustac\u00e6, or zoophite, however moderately rare, supposing the rage for making aquariums had not died a natural death. It had not even a remote member of the samphire, or the horn-poppy family, all its own. Its peculiar butter- flies and exceptional beetles were nil. The chief merits of Dinglemouth were that, though it had a quarter given over to fishermen, it was a fairly clean little place, and its lodgings, whether of the dignity of seaside residences, or of the simplicity of furnished apartments, were to be had at a moderate rate. Its sea was salt and blue \u2014 not with the cobalt of the Medi teranean, but with the peacock blue, shot with green, of which, in favourable weather, on the English coast, one"], [14, "2 A MORNING MIST. has excellent specimens, relieving the silver or leaden gray of other hours of the days, and months of the year. Above all, the air of Dinglemouth was fresh and sweet in its brininess, for on the land side it blew over a purely agricultural country, and brought wafts of new-mown hay, blossoming beans, and the almond scent of haw thorn hedges, all white with flowers, to temper the trifle of keenness in the breeze from the sea border. Withal, Dinglemouth was not greatly frequented ; no fashionable physician had recommended it, no great lady's whim had made the place. Its seaweed was not extraordinarily salubrious. It had not the slightest right to call itself a Spa, and did not even indulge in the most modest of hot and cold bathing establishments ; while neither of its two inns had an ordinary, developing on occasions ; and its pier lacked a brass band. The neighbouring downs, circumscribed at the best, were not given over to games \u2014 the golf of the North, or the cricket of the South. There were out-of-date croquet-greens, or present-day tennis-courts open for a consideration, that the public might be amused ; one of the inns, the oldest of the two, had a bowling-alley, while the \" True Briton \" and the \" Fair Mermaid \" \u2014 ale-houses in the fishermen's quarters \u2014 had skittle grounds, but these were for the private accommodation of customers. Such ex ceptions only proved the rule that Dinglemouth, with its comparative trimness and daintiness, was \"deadly dull \" to a certain order of critic. Dinglemouth was like that highly-respectable class of hotels known as \"family hotels.\" It was a family watering-place. Its clients were chiefly families, for the most part of little people attended by the proper staff of guardians, in the shape of mothers and nurses. Once a week samples of the English citizen paterfamilias ex hibited themselves for a few holiday Sundays among their young barbarians on the sands, as the French bourgeois versions of the same article display themselves on Sundays for the greater part of the year in the gardens of the Tuileries. \"Where there was any variety among the visitors to"], [15, "MRS. HOBBS AND LITTLE MARTHA. 3 Dinglemouth it was supplied chiefly by the presence of maiden aunts and elderly dowagers. The last had come to reckon a week or two's sojourn in the little watering place as somehow essential to the year's well doing. They were there for the purpose of reading daily news papers and yellow-backed novels, on baked or wind scoured benches, on which each seat was jealously disputed by cohorts of nurse-maids and files of long stranded bachelors and consoled widowers. The gayest time at Dinglemouth was during the morning, when the bathing-machines were in full opera tion, and juvenile bathing in the open sea went on, we may say, in matches and batches. In the afternoon the donkeys, which were Dinglemouth's sole contribution of a strictly festal and not largely utilitarian character to the day's engagements, took the place to some extent of the bathing-machines. But in the evening the long curves of primitive sands and shingle, which as yet held the place of a succession of marine parades and esplan ades, were comparatively deserted. The small urchins and nymphs were gone to bed. The matrons and nurse. maids were taking well-earned rest from their labours within doors. The maiden aunts and elderly dowagers had a dread of lurking damp doing its work in tooth aches and ear-aches. The very gentlemen who were the ladies' contemporaries were not without prudent thoughts of rheumatic shoulders and stiffened knees. Only the robust or the reckless among the shifting population cast all doubts to the winds, and haunted the beach, the happy hunting-ground of old and young, till the'sun set and the moon rose, when a sense of wan dullness, savouring of sobs and tears, and wailing lamentations, was apt to steal into the sight and sound of the waves beating monotonously on the shore. Among the exceptional visitors who braved the depressing influence, remaining out till it was dusk, and only returning to their rooms to supper and bed, were a mother and her little daughter. The mother was between thirty and forty, a squarely-made, spare woman, dark haired, and decidedly comely in features and com-"], [16, "4 A MORNING MIST. plexion. She wore good and tidy, but neither expensive nor fashionable, mourning. It was not widow's weeds, nor was it a panoply of crape, the depth of which measured the extent of her loss, while its sombreness was relieved by high lights of jet trimming. It was of suitable, substantial, unpretending black cloth and cash mere, a little oppressive, perhaps, for summer wear, but then Hannah Hobbs was a light footed, active woman, and nothing ever seemed to oppress her. She had the air which one person in a neighbourhood generally possesses, of being capable of taking the whole burdens of the world on his or her shoulders, and summarily dis posing of them without more ado. She looked an unflinching, uncomplaining, though by no means an unfeeling, woman. She was careful of the little girl, also in mourning, who ran by her side, and kind to her with a far-reaching kindness, which was characteristic of the mother. Most women in Hannah Hobbs's circumstances would have been fussing over her little daughter, and coddling her, guarding her from every wind that blew, shutting her up, as it were, in a glass case lined with cotton wool on cold days, on damp days, and especially after sundown. There were acquaintances of Mrs. Hobbs's at Dingle mouth who viewed her conduct disapprovingly, and remarked it was just like her to be so high-headed and foolhardy to go risking the life of one of her only two remaining children in this way. There the mother was, dragging the girl off her feet, keeping her in the open air from morning till night, letting her paddle about bare footed in the pools in the morning, and suffering the child to be her mother's companion in her last stroll between eight and nine in the evening, when all properly brought-up children of seven years of age were being undressed in improvised nurseries, bathed in salt water, heard their prayers, and consigned to their respective cots for the next twelve hours. What mumps and hoarseness, and croupy coughs, passing into measles, scarlet-fever, and diphtheria, did not Mrs. Hobbs bang"], [17, "MRS. HOBBS AND LITTLE MARTHA. 5 over the head of another of her doomed children ? Determined, obstinate woman, who would believe that within the last nine months she had lost three ? Yet what was to be expected for the offspring of a mother so hardened, even, in her natural affections ? For nobody doubted that Mrs. Hobbs had loved her children living, and mourned them dead in her own strong, self-restrained way. The fact was that Mrs. Hobbs knew a great deal better than her critics what was best for her little daughter Martha. She knew that Martha was at present a perfectly sound and vigorous child. She also knew that there could be no better plan for developing in her the strain of weakness which had early shown itself, and had prevailed over every effort to counteract it, in her younger sister and brothers, than to treat Mattie like a hot-house flower by confining her to a house, loading her with clothes, feeding her by rule and measure, and watching every breath she drew. But probably Mrs. Hobbs, who was really not wrong headed, though she was always a little one-sided and straitened in her reasoning, would have stopped short, in the process of hardening the little Martha, at taking her out iu the evening had not another motive come into play. The mother wished the child to have as much of the sea-air as possible, while their stay at Dinglemouth was limited. Joe Hobbs, the locomotive boiler-maker, though he had already laid the foundation of the great trade, one of the results of which was to heap together a great fortune, had been not so long ago merely a servant to the firm whose manager he now was, in which he already held a junior partnership. When he was a servant \u2014 in that not very long ago \u2014 his wages, though good, in acknowledgment of valuable services, required economical management. To this day Mrs. Hobbs distrusted the family's growing prosperity, and anxiously treated it \u2014 as for that matter much trade prosperity in the bud had better be treated \u2014 as a thing of infinite fluctuations, up to-day and down to-morrow, less to be depended upon even than wages, so long as a man is"], [18, "A MORNING MIST. 6 steady, and in his prime, with a good head-piece, and an excellent constitution. If there was nothing else, Mrs. Hobbs had a passion for being at the helm of domestic affairs. She hated to think of her Joe returning home after long business hours at the foundry, and finding himself alone, dependent on the tender mercies of the single servant girl who represented the domestic staff iu the little house at Willesdeu. It did not matter so much for \" the boy,\" young Joe, since he was a day-boarder at the best school in the neighbourhood, but how could Mrs. Hobbs bear the reflected burden of old Joe's solitude of an evening, and of his meals each day, not seen to as she liked them to be, while she and little Martha prolonged more than was absolutely necessary their outing at Dinglemouth ? No, they must be back punc tually at the end of the second week, and in the meantime the child should not be stinted in the sea-air so long as the weather was fine, and the little woman was well wrapped up against falling dew and changing temperature. \" Mother,\" said little Martha, in her clear treble, holding her mother's hand iu a confiding clasp, and taking a few steps in addition to her mother's firm foot falls, \" come and let us see the little lady building castles, below the Gable House.\" \" I don't know that there is much to be seen about ' the little lady,' as you call her,\" objected Mrs. Hobbs (she had an inveterate trick of objecting, but her friends knew it did not keep her from yielding where nothing save her inclination was concerned) \u2014 \" look where you are going, Mattie \u2014 a stage-dressed little creature not fit to take her freedom, and not sufficiently protected against the night air. I should say the boats and the landing of their cargoes make a good deal finer sight ; but if you're set on watching this other child I'll not baulk you, though I am afeared it isn't the best of manners. But for that matter you and me ain't extra mannerly, and a cat may look at a king. She is but a child like yourself after all \" ; and with a sniff self-"], [19, "MRS. HOBBS AND LITTLE MARTHA. 7 respectful rather than aggressive, Mrs. Hobbs and Martha set off for their goal. It was the third evening that little Martha had con templated with much fascination the same spectacle. The first time it had been by pure accident ; on the second occasion it had been by a little childish ruse, of which, child as she was, she had the grace to feel ashamed. This third time it was by a direct request, boldly made to her mother."], [20, "CHAPTER II. THE LITTLE LADY AND HER SURROUNDINGS. The Gable House was one of those seaside residences occupied by the aristocracy and plutocracy among the visitors to Dinglemouth. It was the chief of these residences, having quite extensive and pretty grounds, lawn, gardens, and shrubberies, stretching landward behind the house ; while in order that the occupants might enjoy the full benefit of the waves and breezes, and such stir as was going on in the place, the Gable House fronted the beach, and was only separated from it by a road extending for some distance, from six to twelve feet above it. There was no sea-wall, because a natural barrier of rocks served the same purpose. These rocks descended by a gradual slope to the sands, affording a rough yet sufficiently safe path for small feet to scramble up and down, twenty times a day. In winter the stormy sea dashed against the rocks, swept across them, obliterating for the moment the road itself, lashed against the house, dimmed its window panes with spray and sand, and did all the damage that such an untamed force can do. But there were rarely such casualties in summer, though at full tide the water lapped the rocky barrier, and its lower shelves were encrusted with shells, and draped with green and brown seaweed. The bow-windows of one gable be longed to the dining-room, and that of the other to the drawing-room of the house, and each commanded, not only a wide stretch of sea and sky, but a close-at-hand view of the rocks and sands in the immediate vicinity. The Gable House had once owned a distinction"], [21, "THE LITTLE LADY &* HER SURROUNDINGS. 9 which the natives of Dinglemouth never forgot. It had been tenanted for a summer by a veritable earl and countess \u2014 albeit Scotch, in the depth of genteel poverty, and the height of an extraordinarily large family. What- ever their troubles, however little they spent in Dingle- mouth, they left an aroma of nobility about the house which never altogether left it. Gable House was thence- forth a high-class dwelling, which could not be offered by the local house-agent to any tenant who was not of a superior order. At present it was occupied by Sir Randal Beauchamp and his family, and Sir Randal, as everybody knew, was a Northamptonshire squire and baronet who had run through a great deal of money in his day7, and otherwise achieved no small notoriety among his equals. At the moment when Mrs. Hobbs and little Martha approached the Gable House, by the sands, both the dining-room and drawing-room windows, facing the sea, stood open, for the day had been warm and the evening was fine. In the bay of the dining-room lolled a big, fine-looking man, in spite of the thick silvering of his auburn hair, and the waste wrought in his florid face by other factors than those represented by the fifty- two years quoted against him in the pages of Debrett. He had exchanged his dress-coat for a smoking-jacket, and was sitting with his elbows on the arms of one shabby, morocco-covered easy-chair, and his long legs and slippered feet extended on the seat of another. A small table with decanters and glasses was at his elbow, and he lazily puffed a cigar as he leant his head against the woodwork of the window, and gazed, with half- closed, somewhat bleared eyes \u2014 if the truth were told \u2014 at an object in the foreground of the scene. In the other bay a couch had been pulled forward so as to fill the recess. On it lay stretched a faded shadow of a woman, elaborately dressed in a faint-coloured even- ing dress, and wearing a brilliant theatre wrap. Her thin hair, auburn also, was studiously frizzed and piled in curls forming a positively painful contrast to her hollow cheeks, and to the blaze of hectic red which, like the"], [22, "A MORNING MIST. 10 fiery fingers of autumn on shrivelled leaves, ripe to decay, stained rather than flushed her prominent cheek bones. The solitary concession to weakness was the plush cloak drawn round the thin shoulders raised on the pillows of the couch. The weary head was turned in the same direction as Sir Randal's. The dim eyes watched still more intently the figure which claimed his regard. It was that of a little girl of Martha Hobbs' age. She was provided with a toy spade and pail, and was busily engaged in constructing a miniature canal, with a row of fortresses on the strip of sand, not long laid bare by the receding tide. Never was a small engineer and architect of the gentler sex worse equipped for her labours. She was dressed, as she had lately appeared at her father's elbow, for dessert, as she would presently sidle up to her mother's couch for the last chocolate bonbon, which should recon cile her to the dreadfully dull and stale process of going to bed. She wore a little silk frock of a pale blue tint, peculiarly adapted for easy ruin by sea air and water. The stockings on her slim little legs were of silk, and the soles of her small bronze shoes were about the thickness of a wafer. She had, it is true, a quaint \" Mother Hubbard \" cloak over the smart frock, but the texture of it was little thicker than that of the embroidered muslin pinafore which came between the frock and the mantle ; while on her small head was an exaggerated Kate Greenaway bonnet of rich cream-coloured satin. No wonder the superb, fantastic little apparition attracted the attention of more than her contemporary, Martha Hobbs, and was the tea-table talk in the little watering place, as if this was a case in which people were entitled to talk. There was no precedent for such folly and magnificence. The poor earl's numerous daughters, to the manner born, where aristocratic graces and privileges were concerned, had played on those very rocks and sands in nothing more costly than gingham frocks and straw hats. Certainly they had been provided with a"], [23, "THE LITTLE LADY &* HER SURROUNDINGS. 11 more discreet and imposing-looking keeper, in the shape of a hard-featured, dowdy old nurse, who was as unlike the jaunty young woman with a flower in her hat and linen cuffs down to her knuckles, presiding over the antics of the solitary \" little lady,\" as Sir Randal Beauchamp's daughter was far removed iu idiosyncrasies from the juvenile Ladies Lumsden. \" Go it, Conny ! \" cried the gentleman in the dining room window, removing the cigar from his mouth to deliver the adjuration, and speaking in a naturally pleasant, mellow voice, slightly roughened by ill-usage. \" What do you call your operations ? Is that rock Gib, and is that precipice Ehrenbreitstein, and yon baby fortress Edinburgh or Dumbarton Castle ? Is your ditch the Suez Canal, or do you intend to cover it over and call it the Channel Tunnel ? \" \" I am going to make them all, papa, if Baker will let me alone and give me time,\" the little girl shouted back, gleefully. Then she indulged in a short run and jump on her spade, which sent it squashing into the wet sand, and caused the water beneath to spurt up with a gurgle aud engulf the fairy feet so ill shod for the encounter. There was a half-stifled shriek from the small performer, then followed a rush to the rescue by the careless young person in charge of the child, and a considerable stir and commotion at the drawing-room window. A maid, of much the same showy, useless kind as Baker, who had been sitting sewing unseen behind her mistress's couch, got up and leaned out in the direction of the dining-room window, in order to address an appeal to her master : \"If you please, Sir Randal, my lady thinks it is time Miss Conny were indoors. She says she must not stop out after she has wet her feet like that.\" \" Bless my soul ! is your mistress still at the open window? \" cried Sir Randal, startled out of his ease and his lazy sense of amusement. \" My dear Bessie, how can you be so foolish ? \" He leant out in his turn, and addressed Lady Beauchamp in tones that vibrated"], [24, "12 A MORNING MIST. between kindly indulgence and half-despairing im patience. \" What will Robins say, when he makes his morning call to-morrow? I hoped Baker would have the sense to bring Conny in, without waiting to be told to do so, after she has let the monkey paddle her own canoe into difficulties ; but we'll not trust to so faint a chance. Hey ! Baker, bring in the child at once, do you hear ? '' he shouted down to the nurse. \" Lady Beauchamp has sent for her. Conny, no nonsense, your mamma wants you, and it is high time that you went to her, and then were off to bed. Your extensive operations must wait till another day. Hullo ! What hardy little woman is this ? \" In the interval, Mrs. Hobbs and Martha, who had come along to see the show, had approached quite near without any actual intrusion, of which Mrs. Hobbs was the last woman to be guilty. Then, as luck would have it, a couple of acquaintances of hers in Dinglemouth came up in the opposite direction, and arrested her, keeping her standing by them while Martha drew a little apart, transfixed, gazing at the object of her extreme wonder and admiration. At the moment of the catas trophe Martha did more than gaze ; being a helpful child for her years, and zealous in whatever cause she was interested, she darted forward into the middle of the group composed of the putabout nursemaid and the typical princess who hopped from one foot to the other, and held up and shook each dripping foot, with an air half refractory, half discomfited, and wholly helpless. Martha Hobbs was not come of a helpless stock ; she stooped down, feeling the emergency so great that she could not think of any danger of damage to her own black woollen frock and stout square-toed boots. She pulled out a little handkerchief \u2014 not an embroidered muslin rag, but a square of linen, strong and durable like the rest of her apparel, and proceeded, tenderly and carefully, to dry the bronze slippers and silk stockings. The next moment a fit of shyness seized Mattie. She got up hastily, and drew back a step. Then the two"], [25, "THE LITTLE LADY &* HER SURROUNDINGS. 13 children stood staring at each other, open-eyed as only two children could stare. They presented a marked contrast in all save their years. The little lady, fragile, fine, fantastic, without any choice of her own, and at this moment distressingly bedraggled ; the daughter of the people in her well-nigh ostentatiously homely, woollen frock, and jacket of the most prosaic cut, her sailor hat fitting tightly to her head, with its dark hair clipped well off the eyes and short to the nape of the neck, without qualification or mercy. The utter absence of all lightness and brightness about the child's clothes was accentuated by the fact that she wore unrelieved black. Withal it was a straight, firm figure, rather tall for its years ; a wholesome, embrowned, and reddened apple face, lit up by a facsimile of Hannah Hobbs's deep brown eyes surmounted by black brows. \" I say, my little woman, who are you ? What is j7our name ? \" called down Sir Randal from the vantage-ground of his window. He was a man who had always been easily arrested and diverted from whatever he had on hand, save when it happened to be the pursuit of his own pleasure. It had been his nature to be quickly aud superficially interested in the most trivial novelty that crossed his path. At this moment he was highly tickled by the arrival and bearing of the youthful stranger, so unlike his Conny. The little girl answered his question obediently, and without pause in the middle of her shyness, \" My name is Martha Hobbs, please, sir.\" She did not bob him a curtsey, but instinctively she bent her head with a quaintly courteous acknowledgment. \" And my name is Constance Geraldine Beauchamp,\" broke in the other clear treble voice, not to be outdone. \" I am much obliged to you, Martha Hobbs, for trying to dry my shoes,\" added Constance Geraldine Beauchamp, with grave condescension ; \" but you have not been able to do it. See, I can squeeze the water from my toes,\" and she stood on tip-toe to exhibit the feat. \" Off with you instantly, Conny,\" called her father, in a tone that admitted of no further lingering. \" Baker,"], [26, "14 A MORNING MIST. see that Miss Conny's shoes and stockings are pulled off without loss of time. I trust I may depend upon you for that simple precaution. If she takes cold \u2014 which she is safe to do, otherwise \u2014 Lady Beauchamp will worry. As for you, you sturdy little woman with a sturdy little name \"\u2014he turned smiling to Mattie, while Baker led off her unwilling charge\u2014\" what can I do for you in return for your kindly assistance to my foolish young madam ? Do you care for fruit ? Most little people do.\" He looked round at the fruit-dishes which had been left on the table at his elbow, and picked out the finest bunch of grapes, and the ripest of the peaches. \" Hold out your frock and catch when I throw,\" he told Martha. At this moment Mrs. Hobbs, who had just parted from her friends, came hurrying back. Sir Randal stopped in the act of dropping the fruit. His practised eye, accustomed to deal with different classes as well as with varieties of men and women, made out at a glance something about Martha's mother which showed that she was not a woman in a position to be patronised. Neither was she a person with whom the most debonnaire of careless gentlemen could lightly take liberties. \"I beg your pardon, madam,\" he said, with gracious contrition and a smile. That smile had once been peculiarly winning, before the lined, handsome face which wore it had acquired the haggard, battered look of a man who had seen life in all phases \u2014 creditable and sorry alike \u2014 who had \"knocked about,\" as he would have said, in quarters both reputable and disreputable ; ' ' I trust I am not guilty of any offence ; I did not mean it. Your little girl was kind to mine in a child's strait, and I was taking it upon me to reward her with a trifling boon, which I am accustomed to find exceedingly acceptable.\" \"There is no offence, sir,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with a shade of rustic stiffness, and at the same time with a quiet self-respect and good sense which matched the gentleman's perfect breeding. \"As to begging our pardon, it is rather me as should beg yours, for suffering my Martha to be so taken up with your little daughter"], [27, "THE LITTLE LADY Sr* HER SURROUNDINGS. 15 as to forget herself by making up to her in a childish way.\" \" Don't say so, madam ; it is Conny, my little girl, who lies under the obligation. But if your little girl is ' taken up,' as you say, with mine, why shouldn't they make friends, and be playmates in this Arcadian spot ? Con is rather at a loss for a playmate, and probably your little mite is in the same difficulty,\" he added, quickly, while a shade of something which was more like pain than awkwardness might have been perceptible, to a close observer, in the pleasant tones of his voice. \"Thank you, sir; Martha is much obliged to you,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with a suspicion of reserve in her manner. She went on speaking as gravely as if she were settling a momentous question. \" I ain't sure that it would be either possible or desirable for children as are in different ranks of life to be playmates. It would not be worth while in this case, for Martha and me leave Dinglemouth the day after to-morrow.\" \" Ah ! well, I am sorry,\" said the gentleman, more -carelessly, and at the same time more formally, than he had yet spoken. \"I suppose it cannot be helped \u25a0 but you will bear away my regrets, little Martha, and so you would Conny's, I promise you, if she knew. I wish you good-evening, madam.\" He drew back within his window and suffered the mother and daughter to pass on. \" I should say a pronounced specimen of the lower middle-class Philistine,\" he muttered; \"and yet so honest and downright as not to be without a racy attraction, though doubtless she would not improve on a longer and more intimate acquaintance \u2014 a trifle pungent, and nagging, probably. That kind of woman is often appallingly bristling and aggressive if she has a spice of Methodism about her, as poor Bessie could have told to her cost, in the old days.\" In the meantime, Mrs. Hobbs and Mattie were over taken by the friends with whom the former had so lately parted company, to her hardly-concealed annoyance. They were commonplace, small - minded, gossiping natives of the place. They had caught a glimpse of"], [28, "16 A MORNING MIST. Mrs. Hobbs's interview with Sir Randal Beauchamp, and had hurried after her to get to the bottom of it. They were much more excited aud exercised by what had been the encounter aud colloquy before the Gable House than Mrs. Hobbs or even Martha showed herself. \" What did Sir Randal say to you, Mattie ? Did he give you them grapes ? You are in luck ! What was the dealing you had with his butterfly miss ? \" the assailants breathlessly questioned Martha as the more accessible of the pair. \" Sir Randal did not take a bite either of me or Mattie,\" interposed Mrs. Hobbs, speaking shortly and with a shade of scorn. \" The little girl went over her shoes in the wet sand; that was about it, wasn't it, child?\" \" Yes, mother.\" Martha confirmed her mother's account readily, and then added a little commentary of her own. \" The little lady had such pretty brown shoes and pink stockings, which she did not take care of a bit. They are all soaked and spoilt,\" she ended, regretfully. \" She'll get more where they came from,\" said one of the inquisitors with a sneer ; \" not that there mayn't be a pretty price paid for them beyond the shillings at the shoe-shop, which, if all tales be true as are told of his debts, Sir Randal don't pay not oftener than he can help. He's just drownded in debt, and living from hand to mouth, for all the disorderly crew of servants and the carriage and horses he has brought down with him. That miserable Lady Beauchamp is far gone in a decline. You have only to look at her to know that much.\" \"Little good her promotion has done her,\" chimed in the last speaker's gaunt, austere, maiden sister-in-law. \" I see her a-driving by our shop most fine days, lyiDg back among the cushions in her carriage as lonesome as a pillar of salt, or a pelican in the wilderness \u2014 a deal more lonesome than the poorest tramp as goes selling paper flowers and fireplace aprons, and begging her bread.

JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS ON MAISONETTE AND ITS OCCUPANTS. Fourteen years after Martha Hobbs and Constance Beauchamp met cursorily, and parted speedily, as two children at child-frequented Dingleworth, Joseph Hobbs, was the head of the great locomotive boiler-foundry known as \" Hobbs's Foundry,\" which had become his sole concern, was very lucrative, and had a reputation which extended beyond England \u2014 beyond Europe even. He bought what was not more than a bagatelle of a purchase, where his wealth was concerned, the fine estate and country house of Kingsmeadows in Oxford shire. There he settled himself, with his wife and children, only running up to London several times a week for the business of his foundry. It was with no great desire to be a landowner that Mr. Hobbs took this step. His ambition did not lie in this direction, though he had the fondness for the fields and for all country sights and sounds, which most men of unvitiated nature, born and bred in the country, keep with them, whatever their careers, to the grave's mouth. It was because Providence had blessed the man all round that he put himself to the serious inconvenience of dwelling, for the most part, among the rural greenery of Oxfordshire, and having to take a journey of considerable length and fatigue on half of the lawful days of the week to and from his office in London, and his foundry in Middlesex. By a boon, which both husband and wife valued far before that of their worldly prosperity, the breaks in the family had been repaired, the shrunk ranks-'"], [32, "20 A MORNING MIST. were widened and filled anew, younger sons and daughters had been born to the couple, till their later nurseries\u2014 more spacious and of less Spartan simplicity than those which young Joe and Mattie had occupied in the days when the elder Joe was but a clever and trusty servant, in his master's employment \u2014 were again full with a small crowd of small children. It was with anxious consideration for the welfare of these children, and a haunting memory of those other children whom the parents had lost, that they agreed to have a place of their own and settle permanently in the country. Upon the whole, Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs would have preferred it to be a smaller place, for neither of them was cursed with the vanity and ostentation (the origin of which is often simple and kindly enough) that is frequently to be met with in the nouveaux riches. The Hobbses, hus band and wife, were cast in another mould, stronger, more severe, possibly not so amiable and entertaining. They were proud in their way, but they were not vain. They were conscious that the honours which old Joe's success had brought upon them were as much of a burden as a pleasure, and when the pair consented to fill the roles of squire and squiress in a decidedly aristocratic and wholly Tory neighbourhood, they were sensible the parts might be still more incongruous in relation to the players, while the obligations to discharge their duties thoroughly would be yet more oppressive. But the Hobbses were alike reasonable and sensible. They knew what was due to themselves, and still more to their neighbours, in the great boiler-maker's altered position. He and his wife were willing to accommo date themselves to it, as far as they could. They made concessions to their rise, as less fortunate people have to make to their fall in social standing. The Hobbses had their reward. Mrs. Hobbs, indeed, might never be so happy again, save in the second nurseryful of children which God in His goodness had given her, as she had been in the hard working, light-faring days when she had a struggle to make both ends meet, and did it ; when she had the"], [33, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 21 -satisfaction of showing her Joe how cleverly she could lay* out his wages, and how comfortable her ten fingers \u25a0could make him. But Joe was of a bigger nature altogether. His remarkable talents in mechanics and great business faculty found satisfaction in enlarged \u25a0opportunities for their exercise. He had a great tranquil enjoyment in seeking to bring all that belonged to him \u2014 the estate, and house of Kings meadows which had become his among his other ' ' plant \" \u2014 as nearly as possible to a state of per fection, with the ample means he had at his command. He was a singularly benevolent man, in an undemon strative, patient way, and had a power of ruling and \u2022controlling his fellow-men which was born with him. Naturally, therefore, the more of human-kind he had under his thumb, as it were, gradually to improve and develop physically and spiritually, the nearer he was to content. This helped to reconcile him to the forms and ceremonies of much more artificial and elaborate habits of life than those in which he had been reared. Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs's family fell inevitably into two detachments. The havoc which death had made four teen years before had left a wide division between young Joe and Mattie on the one hand, and the flock in the nursery, just beginning to progress into the school room, on the other. The elder brother and sister were accustomed to speak of their juniors, and to deal with them, as \"the children,\" very much as if the pair had betimes taken upon themselves parental responsibilities and privileges. As a matter of course, the division threw Joe and Mattie very much on each other's com panionship and friendship, based on terms of equality. The couple were a good deal left to themselves in such pursuits as were apart from, and independent of, Joe's attendance as his father's efficient \" sub,\" at Hobbs's foundry and office, and of Mattie's aid to her mother in her social duties. Mr. Hobbs's numerous engagements would have been a sufficient barrier even if the inclination had been"], [34, "A MORNING MIST. 22 present with him to any attempt on his part to act as bear leader to his son. Mrs. Hobbs, though she was pleased to have her eldest daughter with her, felt entirely absolved from any call to attend to her, and watch over her. Little Martha had grown big Martha, and could look after herself. It was otherwise with regard to the children. The house-mother had relegated many offices, even in connection with them, to qualified servants, nurses, and nursery governesses ; but there were other duties, which no precedent, or authority on earth, would have induced her to intrust to the best equipped subordinate. But as for her daughter Mattie, she was a young woman nowadays, every bit as much as Mrs. Hobbs's son Joe was a young man. Their man hood and womanhood would be little worth \u2014 in their mother's eyes \u2014 if these responsible stages of human life did not enable the lad and girl who had reached them to go their own way without hindrance or offence. In the rank in which Mrs. Hobbs had grown up, to which she belonged in heart, never departing essentially from its standards, far greater independence was allowed to young women, as well as to young men, than has been granted, unless very recently, to girls in higher spheres of society. To Mrs. Hobbs's mind, there would have been something positively derogatory to Martha Hobbs's good principles and common sense, in continu ing to behave to her as if she were a child or a fool ; as if one supposed that now, when she was turned twenty, she was not fit to be her own mistress, to find her level,. and arrange her life. In Mrs. Hobbs's original class, there was no mention of chaperons, and if they had been called into existence, there would have been little work left for them. Besides, of what avail was Martha's fine education, if it did not render her mistress of the situation ? Mattie had been as well educated for a girl as her brother had been for a lad. That was saying a great deal, for young Joe had gone through a college course at Cambridge, as well as served what were equivalent to apprenticeships in famous Belgian and French foundries and engineers' shops. Luckily for"], [35, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 23 the young Hobbses, there had been few or no mistakes made in their education. \" Old Joe,\" as he was called, without any objection on his side, and without the slightest intentional disrespect\u2014 rather with a fair amount of wholesome awe, and still more wholesome liking and trust on the part of the many hundreds of men engaged in the great foundry and corresponding office \u2014 knew enough instinctively, self-taught working man as he had been, of what constituted education to order fitly this most important of outfits for young Joe's start in life. Mrs. Hobbs had also reason to be thankful for stumbling on a good adviser, and for recognising the value of the advice when got, in what had to do with Mattie's needs in the matter of education. A thoroughly well-informed, intelligent, excellent woman, the sister of one of the earlier partners of the firm of which Mr. Hobbs had become sole representative, who had always known the Hobbses, always respected them, and taken an interest in them, came with her superior experience to Mrs. Hobbs's assistance. Miss Mildmay recommended a series of schools, in an ascending scale, some of them old-fashioned, some of them new, some at home, and some abroad, which the lady nad tested, either in her own person, or in that of young relations, and through them little Martha was passed in succession till she came out big Martha, without loss, on the contrary, with great gain, to her heart and brain. This was in connec tion with some desirable knowledge of the world, con siderable culture of her intellect and taste, and a very respectable proficiency in various acquirements and accomplishments. As a finishing touch to her education she had, at her own earnest request, served her term as a nurse-probationer in a hospital which had in her case relaxed its rules with regard to the age for the admission of pupil-nurses. At Kingsmeadows, where Mattie Hobbs had a multi tude of interests and occupations, one of her principal pleasures still was her long rides with her brother Joe, when he had the time to spare for the recreation. Brother and sister were alike excellent riders, and they"], [36, "A MORNING MIST. 24 were \"chums,\" if one may so speak, of the closest de scription. They were never at a loss for things to say to each other. They had all the sympathies, dreams, and extravagancies of youth in common. They had a thou sand points to discuss which were affairs of moment to them, while these affairs were either not \" understanded \" by their father and mother, or were coolly relegated by them to a niche of far inferior dignity and importance to that in which the young people would have solemnly installed their projects. Young Joe resembled mostly his father, Mattie her mother, both resemblances being much modified, even transformed by education. The brother and sister were physically as healthy and hardy as their mother had tried to make them. They walked and rode out together unchecked in most weathers, and at all seasons, when young Joe did not believe he had more urgent claims on his attention. It goes without saying that they were never happier, or more unflagging in their enthusiasm, than when they were full tilt at an argument, as they were on this bright, breezy afternoon on which they are presented to the public. They* were walking their horses for the benefit of the argument after the riders had cantered, trotted (for Mattie did not mind a trotting match), and galloped for various stretches. The quiet, greeu country roads and bowery lanes they traversed were adapted to every variety of equestrian exercise. That county of Oxford holds sunk in its soft lap an ancient university, and the classic, piping begin ning of the queen of English rivers, which, after it has grown a great trading highway, bears London on its crowded banks. But Oxfordshire is also made up of well-watered meadows, leafy woodlands, quaint old towns which have not been places of consequence since the Civil War, and more or less modern antiques in the shape of rustic inns, set down by the river for the rest and refreshment of exacting, usurping, boating men. There are likewise genuinely old-fashioned farmhouses and country-houses \u2014 the last mostly of the Queen Anne and Jacobean eras\u2014 like Kingsmeadows, generally buried in wood, or isolated each in its park. It is a place of"], [37, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 25 lush pastures, and sluggish cattle, with occasional bits of rough common. The whole is traversed by white roads, winding or straight, on which the daily traffic may be counted on your fingers \u2014 the manor-house carriage, the vicarage phaeton, the village waggon, groups of labourers trudging to and from work, strings of children dawdling home from the rector's or the vicar's school, which the board school has not yet superseded, only alimented ; with droves of cattle and flocks of sheep on the market day in the nearest country town. There is also a bi-weekly revival of the old stage-coach, shorn of its splendour even as it has been robbed of its utility, and left a mere \u00e6sthetic attenuated phantom of its old solid, important self. A word on the personal appearance of the brother and sister who were used to riding frequently along those pleasant country roads and intersecting lanes, and with out question place a. la dame. Possibly Martha \u2014 or Mattie, as everybody who knew her well, with the exception of her mother, called her \u2014 deserved the priority, for another reason than that of her sex. The pair were good-looking, but she was the handsomer of the two. Both were tall and well-grown, both were dark in the colour of the hair and tne brown tint of the skin ; both had a certain family cast of figure and feature, and a family style of comeliness which pointed them out unmistakably as brother and sister, but there the resemblance ended. Young Joe took after his father, as has been said ; Mattie was an improved edition of her mother. Moreover, by a freak cf public taste, the very peculiarities which were considered detrimental a generation ago, are now elected into positive attractions. By a fickle desertion of former standards, straight black brows are preferred to pencilled brown brows, and square shoulders have taken the place of sloping shoulders. Mrs. Hobbs had been a comely young woman of a somewhat rudely vigorous type in her day. Mattie, according to the latest views on the subject, was rendered still more handsome by the same robust physique. She had additional elements of"], [38, "26 A MORNING MIST. beauty of a less arbitrary and transitory description. She had a glowing warmth of colouring which put all other complexions to shame. The same colouring in her mother, who in her youth was a much less well-nurtured, as she was physically a much harder-worked woman, had never been more than a settled, fresh redness of cheek, apt to get streaky and mottled with years. Martha Hobbs could not boast great regularity of features, but her forehead was broad and somewhat low, as became her straight brows. Her mouth was well shaped and expressive. Her white teeth, and her chin, both with a tendency to squareness, were piquante iu their different ways, if not according to the strictest code of beauty. Her dark brown hair was abundant, and was dressed simply and prettily. Her round throat was splendidly set on her square shoulders. In her well-fitting riding habit and felt hat she was a delectable young Amazon, with a bright, open, strong face. Joe Hobbs had the framework of a big man for his four-and-twenty years, but, like his father, he was loosely-knit and inclined to gauntness. His peaked, brown face was thin enough to approach the hatchet type, while his features were more bluntly moulded than Mattie's. He had missed his mother's dark eyes, though he had inherited her dark hair. He had his father's eyes, light grey, with the curious mirror-like clearness which can lend a beauty of its own to such pale eyes, especially when their tranquil depths reflect inexhaustible stores of thoughtfulness and kindness. It was well for any secrets which young Joe Hobbs might hold in reserve from his friends that his full mouth was hidden by a dark, drooping moustache. If it concealed something of the pleasantness of his smile, it also hid the sensitiveness which was so ready to twitch, curl, draw in, and thrust out, a particularly mobile pair of lips. That moustache was also a safety-valve to very restless hands when they were not holding a horse's reins, or balancing an oar, or clutching a book, or plying a pen or pencil, or flourishing a cricket-bat or tennis-racket,"], [39, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 27 or a billiard-cue. Never stage-struck hero of romance tugged, twisted, twirled, and knawed an unhappy moustache as Joe Hobbs maltreated his, without being in the least conscious of lending himself to a dramatic effect. In his chronic eagerness and earnestness, com- bined with a little shortness of sight, young Joe had fallen into a bad habit of contracting his brows \u2014 black, though his eyes were light grey \u2014 till they had formed the line produced by a perennial frown. The curious contradiction this peculiarity brought out between the upper and lower half of the face was one of the charac- teristic touches by which the man might have been known among a thousand men. The knitted brows above the eyes, which were still ready enough to smile under the lowering pent-house, the pleasant though sensitive mouth, with the quick laugh, which allowed the gleam of the teeth to be seeu through the moustache \u2014 all belonged to Joe Hobbs, and to no other. He was not one of the lazy, languid, gilded youth of the period \u2014 so far from it that it might have been a comfort to himself, and his friends sometimes, if he had been more like them. He was not in the very least blase. Life was intensely interesting to him. He had no end of pursuits, including the studies in science and mathematics, in which he had attained some distinction at Cambridge, and in mechanics as applied to engineering, to which he had given himself when in Belgium and France. But he had also his father's profound regard for humanity, only in young Joe it was a more burning and craving regard. Old Joe said his son had too many irons in the fire, that he ought to be satisfied with perfecting his powers of usefulness and helpfulness in one shape. It should be enough for a man to be, say, the sterlingly-honest, diligent, enterprising master of a great boiler-foundry, helping to maintain one of the mightiest industries of his generation, giving work to many hundreds of employes, and doing his best for their physical and moral well-being and elevation. But this paternal complaint was merely the consistent, inevitable grumble of the father and master against the son and successor of the self-made man, whose heir"], [40, "28 A MORNING MIST. comes, without struggle or effort, into the fruits of the other's toil. In reality Old Joe was secretly proud of young Joe's versatility. He had a fellow-feeling with the lad's active misery at the great national army of paupers \u2014 the stagnating mass of poverty, degradation, and distress, for which there ought to be a remedy. He \u2022could sympathise with young Joe's fretting exasperation at these neavy-footed, thick-tongued, round-backed, labouring men of Oxfordshire, among whom a great university had existed since the days of King Alfred without making them any wiser. The Hobbses had found them in numbers around Kingsmeadows, agri cultural labourers, bricklayers, plasterers, jobbing gar deners, men bred to nothing in particular, who seemed to look upon the existing order of things as established by a Divine decree. Thus they were bound to be resigned to seeing themselves, their wives, and their children ground down to the very verge of starvation, with nothing to lighten their sombre lot save beer \u2014 when they could get it, and an annual harvest festival, a Christmas dole, a day of idleness and of more or less gross self-indulg ence at a neighbouring fair. Old Joe could understand young Joe's desperate vexation at this result of nearly a dozen centuries of Christian civilization and of the prosperity of a great country long in the van of the world's progress. But then Old Joe himself had the infinite patience of mature years, and mature knowledge, of reflective faculties, thoroughly well-balanced, and on a somewhat colossal scale. He was also not without a secret hope that young Joe, with his innumerable seeth ing schemes of emigration societies on a greatly increased and much enlarged system, spade husbandry, technical schools, revival of moribund trades and creation of new ones, extension of University education, together with the cherished possibility of the schemer's getting into Parliament one day, and raising an eloquent voice on behalf of the people from whom he had sprung \u2014 might do something to loosen the chronic swaddling-bands of Political Economy, still in its infancy and not put to any practical exercise. He might be able to befriend sub-"], [41, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 29 stantially the turbulent or the inane lads, the undisci plined or the weak-spirited lasses. He might have an inspiring word to say to, a helping hand to give to, the older beaten men and broken-down women. These were enrolled in tattered aud patched regiments of lounging, gossiping, tobacco smoking, \" tidy-drop-of-gin drinking,\" coarse.over.drawn tea swilling, veteran recruits. God help them ! They sneaked round with a sickly grin , or strode straight with a savage scowl on their bleached or weather-beaten faces, to the slough of Despond and the Castle of Giant Despair \u2014 to wit, the crowded workhouse. And infinitely worse, more disastrous than the hot brand of shame, was the sluggish apathy with which they were prepared to meet their inevitable fate. The Hobbses had not been very long at Kingsmeadows, and the country about was still comparatively new to the riders, especially to Mattie. It was a proof how much they had to talk about, that in place of being engrossed with the landmarks they had just concluded a passage-at-arms on the attitude of the Church, as represented by the parishclergy towards the parish people. Not only Joe, but Mattie had felt herself qualified to speak on the subject, since she had already started with great energy on an independent career as a Sunday school teacher and district visitor. Just then her attention was caught by a cottage of gentility, with the proper amount of high-tilted roof, gables, and porch, green drapery, floral arches, offices, orchard, and paddock, which she did not remember to have seen before. \"What is the name of that pretty little house, Joe? Who lives there ?\" she inquired, pointing with her whip at the object which had excited her curiosity. \" I believe it is called ' Maisonette,' \" he said. \" At least, so Sykes told me, when I noticed it the other day,\" he answered, a little absently, with his mind still dwelling on the gist of his recent argument. \" Don't tell me that it is occupied by a bailiff, or a retired butler, or by the Hon. Somebody's gardener,\" she forbade him, emphatically."], [42, "A MORNING MIST. 30 \" I don't think it is,\" he reassured her, \" though why shouldn't a bailiff or a retired butler have the prettiest house he can contrive for himself ? \" he demanded, with comical warmth. \" Oh ! I have no objection \u2014 none in the world,\" she answered, lightly. \" But that looks such a dainty little place. I should like to visit somebody there ; very selfish of me, I admit \u2014 but still the wish remains. Now, if the tenant were a bailiff or a butler I do not see how I could gain admittance unless I called with the parish magazine \u2014 and the occupant might be a Dissenter, you know, and decline to take it in. Joe, I sometimes wish we lived in America.\" \"So do I, sometimes,\" owned Joe. \"But then there are drawbacks there, also. Erie rings, municipal scandals, States repudiating their just debts, a halting international copyright, frightful corruptions at elections, Presidents shot down like dogs, hugely rich folk flaunting over Europe \u2014 fawned upon by all the poor aristocracies, and returniug West heavily laden with the vices and follies of the decrepit Old World, in addition to the crude errors of the New. No ; I don't know that I care to settle in America.\" \"Which is as well for father and mother; and 1 am not sure but that I might miss you the weest little bit,\" she said, with a bright, affectionate glance. For although the two contradicted each other per petually, and disputed on every topic under the sun till they were black in the face, as Mattie declared, it is hardly necessary to repeat that they were very fond of each other. \" We'll take it for granted,\" went on Mattie, \"that social intercourse is easier, and on a more elastic footing in America, with all its faults ; but you have never told me who lives in Mai sonette.\" \" A couple of ladies, and a couple of maidservants. They have not a guardian angel in the shape of a man- of-all- work on the premises, for I understand the gardener and groom, who is in the habit of driving his mistresses in a one-horse shay, lives in the bosom"], [43, "JOE AND MATTIE'S SPECULATIONS. 31 of his family in the next village \u2014 Rivermeadows, ain't it? This is an austerely maidenly establishment, and ought to be called Dove's Nest, or something of that kind.\" \"How nice and quiet and cosy; no horrid, noisy, disturbing men about.\" \" I was told the maiden establishment had the cruelty to keep a dog on the chain in the backyard, and that they locked all their doors before ten o'clock at night.\" \" To guard their enviable peace and privacy from intrusion ? I daresay they are two delightful old ladies ; maiden sisters, who have grown grey at Maisonette. They will have the histories of all the natives at their finger-ends, and be able to retail the whole cheery gossip of the neighbourhood.\" \" Possibly ; but the ladies are not both old, or sisters, or even related, so far as I know ; one of them is young \u2014 ' an orphant,' Sykes described her, with a brother ' a military gent ' in India. She lives with an old governess who brought her up.\" \" Upon my word, men are not bad gossips. When I desire to hear full details of our neighbours I shall apply to Sykes.\" \" I never said anything against gossip,\" asserted Joe, unblushingly. \" How are we to rejoice or weep with our neighbours if we do not know when they are laugh ing or crying, and what is the cause of their merriment or lamentation ? I can tell you something more, Mattie. The elder lady's name is West, and the younger's Beauchamp.\" \"Beauchamp, Beauchamp !\" repeated Mattie, quickly, \" the name is very familiar to me, somehow. Oh ! that was what the little girl was called whom I met one summer ages ago at Dinglemouth. You remember, I took such a fancy to her that I used to name my dolls for her, and dress them to look like her, till mother put a stop to what she thought an instance of silly ' memorial ' regard \u2014 what shall I call it ? \u2014 which might end in making me sentimental and con-"], [44, "A MORNING MIST. 32 ceited. I wonder if this girl is the same Constance Beauchamp.\" \"Can't say,\" answered Joe, flicking his horse with his whip, rather in the form of a caress than of a chastise ment. \" Probably not ; one is not permitted ta approve of such jolly coincidences in novels, so, of course, they cannot occur in real life. Beau champ is not au uncommon surname in aristocratic circles. There is a belted earl \u2014 you observe I am employing the poetic phraseology of chivalry and the Middle Ages to suit the subject \u2014 who confesses tc* being a Beauchamp, with various less distinguished followers.'' \" My Constance Beauchamp, the first of a line of wax and saw-dust Constances, had no brother, big or small, that I ever heard referred to,\" reflected Mattie, \" Sykes says that the ladies who live at Maisonette keep themselves to themselves, for the good reason that they are as poor as church mice,\" proceeded Joe, reck lessly, \" though why they should retain a dog on the chain in the backyard, if that is so, puzzles me. They* cannot suppose that burglars will frighten them out of their wits, or murder them for the mere amusement of the thing. Sykes adds, that when the ladies have any thing extra to do (why should they have extra things to do ?) his wife does for them, whether literally or figuratively he did not stop to explain. It was she who told him of the poverty of the land \u2014 very likely as an incontrovertible reason for not bringing home sufficient spoil for his supper.\" \" I must cultivate Sykes ; I took it for granted his information was confined to spades and spuds ; I find it extends to men and women.\" \" He won't impart it to a flighty damsel like you. He knows who is a worthy recipient of his con fidences.\" \" We shall see. He receives his wife's confidences ; I shall get at his wife, though she does not live in my district in Rivermeadows.

You would be delighted to suggest some nice little occupation, remunerative aud lady-like \u2014 be sure it is lady-like, Joe \u2014 which, while it added to their slender income, might bring them more into contact with their kind, and keep their time from hanging too heavily on their hands, since you are ' sure it must be \" deadly dull\" for them to keep themselves to themselves.'

Have a gallop Mattie ? \""], [47, "CHAPTER IV. MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IN ARCADY. Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs were decidedly conservative in their ways, though the pair were a son and daughter of the people, and though Old Joe was a stout Liberal in politics. They had renounced their former mode of life, because their sound judgment fully recognised that it belonged to au exploded condition of their affairs, an order of things which, whether they liked it or not, had passed away for them. They knew that it would be unfair \u2014 alike to their children, to the retainers bred by the rise of their fortunes, to their neighbours and those who had now become their social equals, to do otherwise. The heads of the Hobbses* household must take the evil with the good of their prosperity. They had arrived, metaphorically, at Rome \u2014 the capital of civilisation, and they must, to a certain extent, do at Rome as the Romans did. Mr. Hobbs had bought, and he and his family occupied, the spacious Queen Anne country house of Kingsmeadows, built by a lord lieutenant of the county, visited by a king of the realm, George the Third, in one of his royal progresses when the building was comparatively new, so that the king cried, \"What! What!\" at every exploit of the archi tect's \u2014 handed down from squire to squire of long descent till the link was broken, and it fell into Joe Hobbs's hands. Kingsmeadows called for a large staff of servants to keep in order its many suites of rooms, its gardens and park. It had the full complement, for Joe Hobbs was the last man who would live in a house and suffer it"], [48, "36 A MORNING MIST. to fall into disorder and dilapidation. It had to be* furnished in keeping from top to bottom, and it was furnished handsomely \u2014 nay, superbly, of course alto gether modernly, not merely in the most recent improve ments, but in fanciful returns to older fashions. Luckily, the prevailing taste of the day would have guarded the inexperienced furnishers from excess in gaiety and gorgeousness even if the owners' temperaments had pointed to these errors, whereas the sentiments of Old Joe and his wife, with regard to furniture, no less than to dress, were inclined to be staid, even severe. In reality it was Mattie and Joe junior, in their youthful, trained, and travelled enlightenment, and in their sallies of natural joyousness, who indulged in all the \"high lights \" and bright bits in the subdued splendour of the rooms. Having furnished them not for show, and being quite in circumstances to repair wear and tear, the husband and wife would have considered themselves, with justice, fools, if they had not used such parts of the house as could be fitly put to daily use. In relation to the obligations imposed by the place, by the servants, and their welfare, and by such intercourse as the family were likely to have with families in similar houses, the Hobbses' hours and meals were arranged to suit many exigencies. Mrs. Hobbs candidly owned that \u2014 though, so far as she was concerned, she preferred an early dinner, and a substantial tea, with a light supper, except what was kept hot between two plates for the master \u2014 the other programme imposed upon her, with the two o'clock lunch, the five o'clock tea, the regular dinner at eight, after the two Joes had returned from town or from their country avocations, was better for these latter days, better at Kingsmeadows. All this does not sound much like conservatism, but what the Hobbses could retain, without injury and in convenience to others, of their earlier habits they clave to faithfully. They did not give up the old friends for the new, though inevitably they saw the old less frequently. These appeared in periodical relays of plain, rather than polished, men of business, elderly"], [49, "MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IN ARCADY. 37 managers in Joe Hobbs's own, or in other masters', works, even middle-aged mechanics who had stopped short at being skilled artisans, the last in their Sunday suits \u2014 such had been Joe Hobbs's former associates. Mrs. Hobbs' early friends were represented by a sliding scale of mature matrons, and spinsters, in voluminous, or scrimp skirts, out-of-date bugle-trimmed mantles, and home \"done-up\" bonnets, down to \"respectable females \" in still more out-of-date Paisley shawls or plaid shawls and bonnets, which, though ostentatiously neat, and even smart for the occasion, somehow did not look as if they had always belonged to their present wearers. To these visitors \u2014 some of them not without carping jealous feelings expressed with more freedom and frankness than with generosity or magnanimity \u2014 Old Joe and his wife behaved with far more than scru pulous politeness, with sincere friendly attention, in which young Joe and Mattie followed suit, so that not the worse-conditioned servant in the establishment could venture to sneer or giggle, save in the strictest privacy. Both the master and mistress of the house \u2014 which had \u25a0the air of having been built as the abode of dignified leisure, relaxation, and self-indulgence of every lawful kind \u2014 continued as unflaggingly busy, as conscientiously self-denying, as if their bread depended on their diligence and abstinence. It was not very difficult for Mr. Hobbs to manage this, since he had his constant engagements at his office and foundry, to which he attended with clock-work punctuality \u2014 quite as much so as when he was the most trustworthy of servants. Even when he was down at Kingsmeadows there were many obvious calls on his time as squire and justice to which, if he chose to make a galley-slave of himself, and instead of handing over the business to his steward and clerk in sisted on \" tackling it,\" might form a good excuse for his perpetual round of work. But with Mrs. Hobbs the case was different. There was an actual exercise of talent required in a woman, who was not born many-sided, to keep herself peren-"], [50, "38 A MORNING MIST. nially supplied with business. She had too much homely wisdom and fairness to interfere with her servants. She was constantly admitting to herself, and to other people to whom she thought proper to make the admission, that* in her circumstances her servants knew their duties better than she did. She had never been anything more than a good plain cook, while a \" finished cook\" and a/ housekeeper were wanted at Kingsmeadows. There was a large establishment to cater for, with constant calls for specialities in cooking. Mr. Hobbs had to entertain business men and country neighbours. Young Joe brought home with him, generally without previous in timation, old college friends and new acquaintances, whom he picked up here, there, and everywhere. Mattie filled up half-a-dozen of the bedrooms with her former school-companions. She wanted their opinion on her class in the Sunday-school, the schemes she and Joe shared, her choice of club books, new music, and patterns for art embroidery. And when the girls had made them selves useful, as well as ornamental, which she knew her friends would like to do, why there were driving and riding, lawn-tennis and rowing on the river, which were treats to some of the visitors. At certain seasons there were raids by railway on the University City, where the condescending wife of a professor to whom Mr. Hobbs had been of use introduced the young people to the brilliant round of gaieties of the week of \" The Eights,\" or of Commemoration itself. Mrs. Hobbs would not fail her Joe, if she could help it, in what was required from his wife after he had grown a great man. She would not spoil her servants by attempting to do work in which they were pro ficients and she a tyro. She could not make an occu pation of her correspondence. Mrs. Joe's correspondence consisted of half-a-dozen letters spread over a year. She wrote them when she had something to write, and she wrote them deliberately, and with a solemn sense of importance when she was about the task, sitting down at her desk, squaring her elbows, using a new pen, fixing the stamp on the envelope with a smart blow, as"], [51, "MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IN ARCADY. 39 if she had not faith in its sticking without the emphatic application. But as to daily filling reams of paper, scented, tinted, crested, bearing the most elegant of monograms, with prettily-turned compliments, diplo- matic hints, mysterious innuendoes, family news, and all the idle gossip and good stories of a set which means the world to its members, she would have regarded such a proceeding as a foolish and scandalous waste of time. She had not the variety and the special employment furnished by the packing and unpacking consequent on a frequent, or even an annual, change of abode. When she and Joe settled with their family at Kingsmeadows they had no intention of quitting it again unless in some extraordinary family emergency. The heads of the house considered themselves too old for much visiting. Mr. Hobbs indeed had rooms near his office in town, and in the principal manager's house at the foundry, to which the father and son resorted on occasions, and Old Joe would have no objection to in- stalling his wife, as he established his daughter, for a week at a time in these comfortable quarters. From them Mattie could easily witness any public spectacle, visit the picture exhibitions, attend plays and concerts or lectures which took her fancy, look up her friends, and accomplish a fair amount of shopping. But Mrs. Hobbs did not care for leaving home on such small in- ducements, and Old Joe never dreamt of his family's regularly migrating for the prime of the year. Why should they endure the heat and dust of London, in a. dull house, in a dull square, for ludicrously insufficient reasons? \u2014 that Mattie and her mother might hold on by the skirts of some accommodating leader of fashion, for a consideration \u2014 on account of favours received, or expected ; attend two or three balls a night, drive on the aristocratic treadmill in Hyde-park, and return when the season was over, with their health of mind and body half-ruined by ignoble rivalry, fine crowds, exhausted air, and late hours ! Mrs. Hobbs had not been taught music or drawing. She was no great reader, she had not a mania for amateur"], [52, "\u25a0to A MORNING MIST. gardening. What was she to do with herself and her spare time ? She found out for herself by her unaided ability and power of observation that though a lady at the head of a country house may not do housework, she is at liberty to be a hen-wife and dairy- woman. There fore, though not country-bred like Joe, she turned her attention to these departments with characteristic energy. She gathered her hens' eggs, fed her fowls, and reared her chickens as to the manner born, as punctually as Joe went up to his business at the foundry, made estimates, and undertook personal inspections of his farms, with their boundaries, farm buildings, drains, &c. She examined the shelves and vessels of her dairy, superin tended the operations of churning and cheese-making, even skimming milk-basins, making up pats of butter, and crushing cheese-curd at her will and pleasure, with nobody to say her nay. She learnt that, though a country gentleman's wife may not deprive dressmakers and sempstresses of their due by making her own clothes, even when she is qualified to make them, she can convert herself into another Dorcas, and sew for the poor without impropriety. Mattie's district was a great gain to her mother in this respect. Never were semi-paupers more liberally pro vided with better contrived and more suitable garments, though it was not without sundry qualms of conscience on the part of the worker. For she held the decided opinion that, except in extreme cases, every labouring man in England should be able to clothe as well as to feed his wife and children, without the interposition of charity, whether in the name of Church or laity. If he cannot by his own exertions fill the mouths and clothe the bodies of his household, then in God's name let him make every effort to arise and depart to regions where the earth is more productive, or competition less fierce, men's wages less stinted, and their habitations more removed from unsavoury, wind-and-wet-admitting hovels; rather let him and his perish by the way, in search of better things, than stay and augment the exceeding great and mighty army of lazy, greedy,"], [53, "MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IN ARC AD Y. 41 brutalised paupers, appalling in their numbers and in their character. The county accepted the Hobbses as people to be acknowledged and visited. The locomotive boiler-man was too potent socially, his wealth was approaching too colossal a type, in spite of his known and unknown benefactions, to permit him to be neglected. Besides, his neighbours said they would be coming too much in contact with him at quarter sessions, in county councils, on lunacy boards, &c, &c. , not to render it awkward for them to decline his acquaintance. The ladies of the county adopted the same plea with regard to Mrs. Hobbs, adding, after a moment's hesita tion, that the younger members of the family, who were grown up, had been well educated and rendered per fectly presentable in society. It would be neither kind nor wise to refuse them access to the country houses around. Better put up with a few trials from the parents' peculiarities than stamp out the young people, and lose what might be gained by cultivating them. There were not so many available country houses within driving distance as to make it prudent to strike Kings meadows out of the list without strong reasons. Possibly there was yet another motive for admitting the Kingsmeadows people into the charmed circle. It was a slightly heavy and blase circle, and considerable amusement might be derived and circulated, under the rose, from the parental peculiarities referred to. They might form materials for diverting chat, and for those endless airy letters which were shed abroad from every domestic centre. However, if such slyly lively calcula tions had an existence, they were destined to be con siderably baulked. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Hobbs were hardly amusing people in the sense intended. They had a plain dignity about their unaffected homeliness and lack of pretence which was difficult to turn into ridicule. The worst that could be said of them was, that they were heavy, like the county circle itself, and formal in their civility to those who could not reach their intelligent familiar side. They were a little dense,"], [54, "42 A MORNING MIST. too, and they appeared unsocial. Old Joe readily paid his subscription to the Hunt, but he did not appreciate the privileges to which the membership entitled him. He could stick on a horse when he was a country boy, he said, but he had been entirely out of the way of riding for many a year, and it would not be worth while, even if he could find time, to renew the practice so late in the day. Oh, yes ; his son rode, and he had no doubt would have much pleasure in riding to hounds, when he was not otherwise occupied. The idea of a man of any age not finding time to go to the meet ! The notion of a young man, a millionaire's son, having any occupation which could interfere with his presence in the field on a hunting morning ! Mrs. Hobbs possessed wit of a certain description, but let this be said, under the rose, too, the audience in question were not, as a rule, capable of enjoying wit that was not of a stereotyped kind. Another distinction of hers, which would have charmed a philologist, had not the same effect on these tamed and trained ears. They were decidedly startled and shocked, but they were only moderately entertained. They did not get half the good more learned and reflective ears might have got from the striking idiosyncrasies of her speech. It is said that many old people, or people at the point of death, return at a bound to the speech of their child hood and early youth, overleaping the intervening smoothing down and varnishing stages, or the very elements and constitutions of the foreign languages into which the men and women may have drifted in the mean time ; and they speak again their mother tongue, pure and undefiled, as when the speakers stood at a mother's knee, or ran by a father's side. The story is also told of people long exiled, but not alienated, from their native country or district, whose records and associations the wanderers have cherished\u2014 far more fondly and faith fully than such ties have been preserved by their brethren on the spot, privileged to live and die there, and so holding their privileges but cheaply. It has been related how these travelled folk will come back to their"], [55, "MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IN ARCADY. 43 \" calf -country, \"where the natives have taken it for granted that their former countrymen or townsmen must have entirely forgotten the vernacular, and replaced it, as they themselves have been laboriously seeking to do, by something more cosmopolitan, with a more imposing sound. Then they will be amazed and disconcerted to find their roving compatriots returned home as Scotch, or Irish, as Yorkshire, or Aberdonian, as when they de parted. Mrs. Hobbs was neither near death, nor had she reappeared in old familiar haunts from sojourning on foreign shores, but the fact of having been transplanted into an entirely different sphere, with the doors of the past well-nigh closed upon her, must have worked in her some of the processes accomplished by approaching the end of a life-journey, or by lengthened exile^ Anyhow, there was conspicious in her a feature which was not noticeable in old Joe. He spoke like a plain, self-educated man, with occasional old-fashioned modes of expression, and lapses from modern standards of diction. In the friction of wide contact with men of all ranks, he had naturally lost, except in moments of excitement and emotion, the tricks of speech of his early days. It was the reverse with Mrs. Hobbs ; by some inexplicable perverse influence of reaction, and defiance which she could not control, she had retrograded to the unsophisticated Doric of her childhood. She seemed to have forgotten whatever superficial improvements in the pronunciation and arrangement of her sentences she had learnt, and she was indifferent to the forgetfulness. She committed enormities in grammar of which she would very likely have been innocent in the days when Joe Hobbs was beginning to rise in the world, and she had chanced to have speech with Sir Randal Beau champ at Dinglemouth, and after she had committed them she sat unabashed. The material of her conversation showed all the growth in knowledge oS life which a woman of her years and undoubted ability might have been expected to show, but the manner was that of the shrewd but ignorant and illiterate girl,."], [56, "44 A MORNING MIST. whom Joe Hobbs, the artisan, had wooed and wedded. There was something which would have been fascinating to a philologist and a student of human nature in Mrs. Hobbs's primitive words, and in the \u25a0contradiction between her matter and manner, not less than between her manner and her social position and surroundings, but the country gentry in the neighbour hood of Kingsmeadows were neither philologists nor students of human nature. Her family were really better able to prize her individuality in this light. There was some lively talk, with some light laughter, \u25a0drawn forth by an incident which occurred in connection with Mrs. Hobbs's introduction into county society. However, she did not take the initiative ; neither was she the principal person in provoking the talk and laughter. The lady, with the highest aristocratic claims in the neighbourhood, was an earl's daughter and a duke's niece, who had married an Oxfordshire squire. In addition to her superlative privileges by birthright she was an airy young lady, full of airy caprices. She had \u2022chosen to take umbrage at some of the advances made to her, on terms of equality, by squires' wives, who were no more than squires' and clergymen's daughters. Lady Theresa Langton, in her extravagant self-conceit, thought fit to try to drag down the whole local squire archy by making a display of her opinion that the wife of the great boiler-maker, with her rigid, rustic deport ment, and unknown tongue, was every bit as good as the other squires' wives. Accordingly, her ladyship got up a sudden violent attachment for Mrs. Hobbs, the exhibition of which \u2014 very perplexing and annoying to its object, culminated in Lady Theresa, who was a tall, elegant young woman, suddenly precipitating herself on Mrs. Hobbs's flat, rather than expansive, bosom, and kissing her in the light of day, in full view of the public, on the occasion of a parish cricket-match in which young Joe played \u2014 the special reason why his mother went to look on with the rest of the company. Poor Mrs. Hobbs extricated herself with some diffi-"], [57, "MR. AND MRS. HOBBS IA ARCADY. 45 culty, and hastily set her disarranged bonnet to rights. \" I beg your ladyship's pardon,\" she said, with a mixture of shames acedness and indignation, \"but I must tell you that I don't go with huggings, 'cept among near rela tions, and not often then.\" \" My dear Mrs. Hobbs, if you do not like to be kissed I cannot help it. You should not provoke me to do it,\" replied Lady Theresa, unblushingly, but she did not repeat the performance. Mrs. Hobbs's relations with one of her other neigh bours at Kingsmeadows were more satisfactory. There was a poor widow lady afflicted with a son who had arrived at the last degraded stage of a miserable career. He had positively become a dangerous inmate of her house. She had no control over him, none of her other children were at home to interpose on her behalf ; her eldest man-servant did not dare to interfere. In her desperate terror, and her shame before her old acquaint ances, she suddenly summoned a wcman, who was almost a stranger, to her aid. She had barely exchanged calls with Mrs. Hobbs, but she had seen the new-comer talking to her son at the cricket match. Mrs. Hobbs evinced no surprise and no reluctance in obeying the summons. The use of a neighbour, in Mrs. Hobbs's eyes, was to help in time of need. She was secretly gratified by Mrs. Chetwynd's applying to her when so many other people had a better right to expect that she would send for them. She would have been more than ready and pleased to attend all the sick-beds and death-beds in her new circle, and that from no mere idle curiosity or craving for sensationalism, though she had objected to being kissed by Lady Theresa Langton. Mrs. Hobbs went to Chetwynd Lodge, and intrepidly faced and mastered the wretched young man in his drunken frenzies and horrors ; stood by his mother, and remained with her in the mingled relief and anguish of sending the prodigal away from her and from his disreputable associates, as the last hope for him. When death mercifully interposed, and put an end to sins and sorrows which scarcely admitted of any other termina-"], [58, "46 A MORNING MIST. tion, Mrs. Hobbs mourned with the broken-hearted, weak-spirited woman, who had still possessed a true instinct in appealing to her latest acquaintance in her extremity. In the act the stranger in the scene showed an amount of gentle patience which none, save the most experienced and skilful physiognomist, would have pre dicted from a first glance at her independent and some what hard exterior. But from that date there was a real, though not very equal, friendship between Mrs. Hobbs and Mrs. Chetwynd."], [59, "CHAPTER V. MRS. HOBBS RESUMES AN OLD ROLE WITH SIGNAL SUCCESS. The friendly terms on which Mrs. Hobbs stood with her Rector and his wife had an absolutely comical origin. The Rev. Cyril Parry was an earnest, enthusiatic, young High Churchman, who spent himself and his fellow-workers, ecclesiastical and lay, in daily -services, saints' days, small attempts at retreats and confessionals, struggles with his bishop (who was neither so advanced nor so traditional a Christian), and wild, unpractical, wrestling with the wants of the poor, in reckless alms - giving, and the furnishing of forced, artificial channels of work, for the unfortunates stand ing all day idle in the market pla.ce. These channels invariably failed disastrously, if they were tried for many weeks. Mr. Hobbs contributed liberally from his abundance to the funds of the Church, but neither he nor his wife, nor for that matter, young Joe \u2014 all of whom had studied human nature and political economy, either in the raw or the abstract, had a grain of faith, apart from the clergyman's sincerity, in his philanthropic methods. It was Mattie, who was always fighting her parson's battles, though he was only her parson and not her priest, and she bad not the slightest inclination to try the virtues of a more or less disguised retreat, and a mysterious late or early confessional. But she knew better than the others knew, in connection with her school class, and her district visiting, how the young Churchman toiled and drudged, was beaten back, and"], [60, "48 A MORNING MIST. returned faithfully to the charge. He might be like the unhappy Steuarts and Bourbons \u2014 whom, by the way, he was disposed to regard with a secret tenderness and reverence \u2014 and learn nothing from his defeats. Business like sagacity and shrewd common-sense might still be strange acquirements to him. He might persist in regarding the most incontestable first principles of political economy as a snare of the devil, and go on acting so that the Church, if he had his will, would rapidly fall back into Roman Catholicism ; while the people, looking to the Church alone, would be once more her vassals as in the Middle Ages, and would be even more deplorably and hopelessly pauperised than they were under present untoward conditions. But, at least, he was true as steel to his standards ; he was ready to maintain them to the death, he was wearing out his life in upholding them. He would have, and had, emptied his wardrobe and cupboard, and gone himself ill-clad and ill-fed, to clothe the naked and feed the hungry, who were as naked and hungry as ever, by their own fault, in the course of a very few days. He strove \u2014 not the less honestly and unremittingly, that it was without the slightest permanent effect, he could see, on the seething mass of dense ignorance, skulking cowardice, shirking indolence, brutality and bestiality in the lowest depths of the Arcady around him. He could send a ray of Divine light into the gross darkness ; he could point the penitent to the all-forgiving love ; he could teach an element of resignation to the weary and meek-hearted among the heavy-laden sufferers ; and he was content to do this. Not to help them to make their earthly lives wiser and better, but to point them to a heaven which would compensate for all the errors, wrongs, and pains of this life, was the Rev. Cyril's mission. And no one who watched him intelligently and did him justice could deny that he fulfilled it, at whatever cost to h'mself and Mrs. Parry. For Mr. Parry had another disciple as loyal as Mattie was, and far more of one mind with him, in his wife, who had followed him till she had exhausted herself in his cause ;"], [61, "MRS.

She could not rejoice ecstatically in the sacrifice after she had worn out her health and strength in running after him in his break of-day and midnight services, his fasts and vigils, his mothers' meetings, and fathers' meetings, boys' meetings, girls' meetings, temperance gatherings, clothing societies, book-clubs, choir practisings, church decorations, &c, &c. She tottered back to the Rectory, giddy and faint, looked round in despair rather than in silent satisfaction, on waste, disorder and dawning anarchy. Her children were left to unsuperintended, undisciplined servants chosen for their cheapness, their superficial neatness and pro priety, and easy pretensions to represent clerical domes tics \u2014 above all, because they were staunch High-Church women. As a natural consequence, the children were disobedient, ill-mannered, sly, and stubborn. The very servants, who were practically mistresses of the situation, were rising in angry rebellion against her, because she could not manage her house and family, and did not provide a housekeeper, or lady-help to manage for her, but was so shockingly unreasonable as not only to expect them to do all the work but also to lay down the law for the establishment, and keep it after it was laid down. Poor, early-faded, haggard, nervous Mrs. Parry was acutely conscious of all the confusion and slovenliness around her. She shrank from the idea of visitors seeing how little well-bred order and decorum, how little dainty beauty, how little even of comfort was in the Bectory, which she and her dear, absorbed, exalted Cyril had thought such a pretty home-like dwelling when they first came to Rivermeadows. She was even pain fully sensible while she doled out flannel to others that her own Jager suits were threadbare, that she had not the nourishment she needed in her frequent illnesses, that her frocks and mantles, hats and bonnets, were out of date and shabby to the last degree, so that from the handsome, happy, well-dressed young girl she had been 4"], [62, "50 A MORNING MIST when she married she had fallen away into a broken down clergy worn an.

But Mrs. Hobbs advanced straight to the mistress of the house, only turning back with a determined movement to shut the door for herself, and at the same time to shut out the nursery help. \"What is it, ma'am?\" she asked plainly, looking down at the weeping woman. \" I make bold to ask, in case I can do anything.

The Squire of Kingsmeadows, though he was no more, to this day, than a monster boiler-maker, while his wife made no disguise of having risen from the ranks also, was not a parishioner to be lightly despised. Their daughter, Miss Hobbs, though not satisfactory in all respects, was a dear good girl, energetic and clever, a tower of strength in her way to Cyril. So w*as her brother, young Mr. Hobbs. Yet, for Mrs. Parry to commit any one of her spoilt, unruly darlings to the austere tender mercies of the unhesitating woman before her was an extreme step, to which the burdened mother could not consent. She was on the defensive for her offspring in a moment."], [64, "52 A MORNING MIST. \" Indeed, they are not by any means bad children, Mrs. Hobbs,\" she pleaded. \"They are a little wild, poor innocent pets, because I am not quite in such good health or so active as I might be, and therefore cannot look closely after them, in addition to my church and parish duties. That cruel, deceitful girl Sarah, whom we had to dismiss because of her giddiness, though she declared she was so benefited by the early services, and by the privilege of having the church open at all hours, as a house of prayer \u2014 has spread wicked stories over the whole place about the poor dear children : that they are the crossest children in the village or out of it \u2014 that there never were such children.\" Poor Mrs. Parry, who had been beginning to recover her equanimity, broke down afresh at the insult to her babes. \"I'd not mind her if I were you,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, \u25a0briefly, \" ill wordses break no bones, least of all if they ain't true.\" \" I don't mind what people say, as a rule,\" declared Mrs. Parry ; \" I have more to do than attend to idle \u25a0gossip, which my husband never heeds.

They have all left this morning. Of course, I have engaged other servants, but I had to do it in a hurry, and take whom I could get, so that I doubt whether I shall be nicely suited. In the meantime I have nobody except Lizzie, and I cannot venture to find fault with her, lest \u2022she should go, too. A girl thinks nothing of running away from her first place if everything is not to her mind. I am sure our girls don't think anything of it, and that is the character the girls get in the village.

They'll remember how they find the house, and they'll not reckon themselves bound to keep or leave it better than they found it.\" \"I cannot help it,\" protested Mrs. Parry, drooping despondently. \"I have so little time, and I am afraid I do not know very well how to direct the servants. I can help the Rector a little in the parish : I always looked forward to doing that, but I am not fit for much else. I married soon after I left school, and I was never in the way of learning housekeepiug. Papa was a clergyman of the old school, with a good living. I am sure he was a good man, according to his views, and did his best in teaching and serving his people. But his parish was not a poor place like this, and times were different. He did not see himself called upon to do what Cyril does. Neither had mamma so much to do ; she could afford to keep good servants, and everything in the house seemed to go on as regularly as clock-work, and as if by magic. Papa was famous for his nectarines and his roses ; and he was able to devote a good deal of time to them. Mamma had the prettiest china and the sweetest chintzes in the neighbourhood. There was nothing of a foolish round of dissipation where we were concerned, of course, for papa was a clergyman, and would not have liked it, even if mamma had been too yielding, and we boys and girls had been thoughtless. Yet, while we did what we could of parish work, we had such happy times to ourselves, so many old friends staying in the house in the summer, such games of"], [66, "54 A MORNING MIST. tennis, such walking and riding parties, and gay picnics ; and in the winter such merry carpet dances among our neighbours. Oh, dear ! you have no idea what a sweet, nice old place my home was,\" ended Mrs. Parry, wist fully. \" Yes, I think I have,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, nodding her head ; \" I used to go into the country when I was a girl, to stay with an aunt, as had been housekeeper in a clergyman's family, nigh at hand ; and when they was from home her used to take me for a treat to see over the house. I can remember as well as yesterday, I thought it a picture of comfort and peace, and nice, pretty gentlefolks' ways.\" \" That must have been like my old home,\" Mrs. Parry hastened to interpose. She was wondering in her own mind whether Mrs. Hobbs had made a slip in owning that her aunt had been an upper servant, though she did not seem to notice or care if she had done so ; and, oh dear, she did speak dreadful grammar ! But it was only Mrs. Parry who felt awkward, and hurried to say something else: \"I had a very bright youth, I know that now ; but I am glad, even while my failures humble me, to have left it behind me, and gone with Cyril to dedicate ourselves to a higher mission,\" said little Mrs. Parry, with something of her husband's rapt look in her blue eyes. \"Is it higher?\" was on the tip of Mrs. Hobbs's tongue, but she refrained. She said, instead : \" Why don't you get a couple of respectable servant-girls \u2014 to whom your work would be neither here nor there, instead of four incapable madams as spend their time making work for theirselves ; you might have a good plain cook and a handy house and table maid, as could also take part of the nursery work. You have no baby now, your youngest ain't more than eighteen months younger than my Bessie. A young governess, if you could afford it, would be a good deal more to the purpose than a couple of them idle hussies of maids, dawdling about the house \u2014 cutting capers, telling tales, and putting nonsense into each other's heads.\""], [67, ".MRS. HOBBS RESUMES AN OLD ROLE. 55 \"It might be better,\" said the mistress of the idle \u2022maids, wearily, \" though, of course, there is the dignity of a clergyman to maintain \u2014 one must not forget that. And where are such good servants to be found ? If they are in existence they will not come to me ; \" and Mrs. Barry looked round her hopelessly. \" Not if they has to face a mess like this to begin with,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with unsparing candour. \"If they was any time with you, and knew you a bit, they might bear with upsets, just for your sake and their own credit as well.\" \" I know they say in the village that they cannot stand our unearthly early and late hours,\" acknowledged Mrs. 'Parry, plaintively; \" and that there is no regularity or punctuality in the house. They never know when Mr. Parry is. to come in for his meals, or when the larder is not to be left bare, and cook set cooking at all hours to supply food for sick paupers. Then there are the dinners, teas, and suppers to be provided at Christmas for the ringers and the choir and the church helpers, the Band of Hope, the old men, and the old women, and the school children, besides the treats and festivals in summer. Of course there are contributions and collections. Many of the richer parishioners \u2014 Mr. Hobbs and you among them \u2014 are most liberal and kind, but the expenses which Mr. Parry sees himself called upon to incur are never all covered, we are always out of pocket. We can do no more, we cannot supply additional aid, we did try to do so at first, but we could not go on if we would keep out of debt, which would break Cyril's heart, he is so scrupu lous and honourable. It would be such a disgrace to the Church and to him. We have paid our way, as people say, so far, I am thankful to say, though we are so straitened. I don't mind mentioning this to you after you have been so interested in hearing about our difficulties, and have given me good advice, if it were in my power to take it. Very often we get little sympathy, because, as it happens, our tithes are rather better paid than many in the diocese.\" \" I understand,\" said Mrs. Hobbs to the rector's"], [68, "56 A MORNING MIST. wife. \"You goes and serves everybody before your selves, and you expects your servants, as gets no credits mind you, and whose consent to the arrangement ain't so much as axed, to do likewise.

I'm fain to say that, to be honest, neither me nor Hobbs is with you in them everlasting services and meetings,\" declared Mrs. Hobbs, solemnly. \" I'm fain to think we ain't Chris'ans only or chiefly in a body.\" \"Oh! Mrs. Hobbs, the body of the church,\" exclaimed Mrs. Parry, reproachfully. \"As is made up of the single souls of men and women,\" asserted Mrs Hobbs, \" each a-knowing its own cares, and each a-bearing its own burdens, as cannot be swallowed up in a heap, and dealt with in a lump. Men and women ain't like a flock of sheep, or a herd of cattle.

You and me, and every one of us must have fair time and decent retirement for what is our work a-tween us and our Lord and Master. We are not to be druv into heaven in bands and companies. Besides, them never ending services and meetings can only be attended honestly by the well-to-do and the idle, and I ain't by any means clear there should be any idle in a Chris'an Church.

It is partly their own doing, I won't go for to deny ; but for folk as professes to care for the poor, silly, helpless people \u2014 sheep, King David called them \u2014 as cannot take care of themselves, why don't their betters give them houses fit to pray in, and live and die in ?

In some of them German schools and cooking schools and nursing hospitals she have attended \u2014 for she has had a deal of schooling one way or t'other \u2014 she was teached above and beyond book-learning, to scour pots and pans, ay, to scrub floors and shake up beds, as well as to toss up dishes and wait on the sick.

But I needn't ask, I'll find them \u2014 no question.\" Accordingly, to Mrs. Parry's mingled dismay aud for- lorn hope of some change for the better in her strait, Mrs. Hobbs descended boldly into the lower regions, where she certainly made far less noise than was achieved by the rampaging young people aloft, even after their mother had entered her feeble protest. Undoubtedly, Mrs. Hobbs enjoyed herself in her raid. She reappeared at the drawing-room door, with the strings of her bonnet flung back and pinned by the ends to the crown of her bonnet, over which she had also tied her handkerchief to protect her from the volumes of dust she was raising, her mantle and gloves removed, her sleeves rolled up, her skirt folded and arranged in two swallow-tails behind her, permitting a bird's-eye view of a pair of carefully-stockinged and shod, somewhat wooden ankles and feet. Their owner was so full of grim humour and glee that she let herself bob a curtsey while she asked Mrs. Parry if her new kitchen-maid might come into the drawing-room and have a word with her ? As if the Rector's wife was not sufficiently covered with confusion already ! \"I think I've made matters a little more shipshape downstairs. I've cleared away the surface dirt, and it ain't one day, or two neither, as will be enough to do more.

Her good cloth and silk gowns, her very mantles and bonnets would, to the despair of those who were professionally accountable for her clothing, take something of the scrimp look which distinguished the apparel of the humbler friends who visited her. It was as if the tidiness and trimness, together with the saving propensities, which had been virtues in her younger and poorer days, had turned to vices now, and lent an additional stiffness and sparing ness to her air. But it was not to a bony angel, with a flavour of uncalled-for thrift, and parsimony, that the Rector objected. \" My love, I believe Mrs. Hobbs is a good woman of her kind,\" he sighed, \"if she would only be more spiritually minded, aud set an example to the world.

She proclaimed in an authoritive, solemn manner that, a3 the Rectory did not keep a sewing-maid, she, Mrs. Hobbs, was not standing in anybody's light, while the supply of work was just what she wanted to supple ment the requirements of Mattie's district, and to keep her hands employed. A still greater boon which Mrs. Hobbs conferred on her parson and his wife was that she managed the elder children from the Rectory should be sent up every day to Kingsmeadows, to be taught and trained under a competent governess, along with the young Hobbses who were passing from the nursery to the schoolroom. Thus the scandal of Lilliputian anarchy would be removed, it was to be hoped, from the pattern house in the parish."], [76, "CHAPTER VI. -JOE HOBBS, SENIOR, IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS TO THE WIFE OP HIS BOSOM. Young Joe and Mattie talked a good deal at dinner, on the day of their ride past Maisonette, of the dainty, flowery cottage of gentility they had passed, aud of Mattie's speculations whether the Miss Beauchamp who dwelt there with an elderly companion, or chaperon, could by any chance be the little girl who had taken Mattie's fancy at Dinglemouth. Old Joe said little or nothing. He sat, for the most part, silent and reflective, as he was apt to do on all occasions. He was a kind of mortal Zeus, whose thunderbolts were of much consequence to the world at large, and naturally occupied him to such an extent that, even in the centre of his family and in relation to affairs which interested them, the tendency was growing upon him to sit a little apart, as it were, in a kind of grand impartiality and masterly inactivity. But he was not in the slightest degree a wet blanket on the circle, or in any company in which he happened to be, for far sighted tolerance and quiet sympathy were in his silence. Mrs. Hobbs spoke from her seat at the head of the well-equipped dinner table : \" If so be it is the same girl, Mattie \u2014 as ain't over likely\u2014 I hope you'll not run wild after her, as you did when you were a child.

They earn their living, perhaps contribute to the maintenance of others, there fore they are entitled to be treated as independent* responsible beings, free to follow their own course, and act on their individual convictions. \" My dear mother, there is no danger of my being so foolish again,\" said Mattie, with the serene assurance of having survived all illusions which belongs to tw7enty and a \"little upwards.\" \" I don't suppose that my little lady was much more than a ridiculously dressed up, spoilt child. From my recollection of her to-day, I am afraid she was a self-willed, badly brought-up child, who treated the small service which I tried to do for her as if it were a favour on her part to receive it, and an honour on mine to bestow it. But you must let me retain some interest in the living model and sponsor of the dolls of my childhood.

She w7as in the habit of going with her husband, if no \u25a0one else, not even young Joe, was with him when he went to his self-constituted smoking-room. He sat but a short time over his wine, and liked to take his smoke before he repaired to the drawing-room for his cup of tea. It was one of those lingering, odd, homely practices on the part of husband and wife to which the butler and upper servants had to yield, with a sigh\u2014 seeing that their master and mistress were utterly impervious to the respectful hints which would have led them, after a gently patronizing fashion, to amend the error of their ways. Mrs. Hobbs would have told you readily that she did not mind a good strong \"smush\" of honest tobacco smoke, any more than did the fast, fine ladies who praised the more subtle aroma of the cigars of their male \u25a0companions, and tried cigarettes on their own account. She could not go so far as that, but she rather liked the tobacco-smoke, for it reminded her of the time when her Joe always had his smoke beside her, in her front kitchen, where she sat sewing of an evening, while the parlour"], [79, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 67 *was kept sacred to company. The improvised smoking room which Joe Hobbs preferred was not altogether unlike the front kitchen of pleasant memories. It was \u25a0not the smoking room of the house to which Joe took 'his company, and young Joe his friends. It was a small, plainly-furnished room in which the head of the great tfirni of boiler-makers kept sundry little models of 'machinery with business plans and specifications, which \"it seemed to him would have been out of keeping, and have appeared lumber and litter, in the fine library of *the house. He had kept much the same models and \u25a0plans in a corner of the front kitchen at Willesden ; and Mrs. Hobbs, from her rocking-chair by the window in the twilight, or in the dusky glow of the fire, felt as if \u25a0she had but to shut her eyes to conjure up a cherished vision of the past. Generally she did the talking in racy scraps of what had been going on with visitors, children, and servants in his absence, and he smoked and listened with that homely Jove -like air of soaring above and beyond it all and only coming back to chime iuwith a word in season. But after dinner on the evening in question, it was Joe who showed himself disposed to speak, and Mrs. Hobbs who subsided into the part of listener. \" I want to tell you something, Hannah,\" said the man, with a slight, nearly imperceptible effort, taking the pipe from his mouth, and looking straight at his faithful partner, who was slowly rocking herself to and fro in the blind man's holiday. Her strong hands were for once free from even the play of work, with which she w*as fain to content those exacting members \u2014 exacting for tasks to fulfil, as were Michael Scott's devils of old. The hands, and the spare arms to which they belonged, were akimbo in one of the attitudes in which the original working-woman is apt to indulge in her hours of ease \u2014 these are not very numerous or varied, and range chiefly from the akimbo position, to the hands at each side of the waist, or on the hips, to one hand thrust into a side pocket, and the other twirling the corner of an apron. Mrs. Hobbs no longer wore an apron, unless when she"], [80, "68 A MORNING MIST. chose to act as an amateur kitchen-maid, and her pocket was, as she was in the habit of complaining vigorously, as far beyond her reach nowadays as if it were in the toe of one of her slippers, or in the crown of her cap. But she had attitudes other own, which were not affected by alterations in dress or surroundings. She had a curious way of hanging one hand by her side with the fingers clenched, while the other lay in her lap doubled up pugnaciously. She might be meaning to fight the world of sloth and incapacity with these clenched fists. She would interlace her square-tipped fingers tightly and place them thus on the table before her, careless that her elbows were in the same line. She would also1 step briskly up and down with her hands clasped behind her back, in a slightly Amazonian style. \" I want to tell you, Hannah,\" Joe Hobbs began again, \" that this girl at the house they call Maisonette is Sir Randal Beauchamp's daughter ; there can be no doubt about it.\" \"Is she? Then all I'll say is, that I hope Mattie won't take to running after her, cool as she is about her to-night. But how do you come to know, and why didn't you say as you knowed she was the same, when young Joe and Mattie were speaking of her? \" inquired Mrs. Hobbs, with a little surprise. She had a dim, un acknowledged consciousness that there was something not quite to be accounted for in the amount of constraint, and also of earnestness, with which her husband was proceeding to discuss, confidentially, such a trifle. \" Coxe was my informant,\" said Mr. Hobbs. He re ferred to a retired military officer, a bachelor, who had occupied rooms for a dozen years in a farmhouse between the station and Kingsmeadows. Having no business of his own to attend to, he was the accepted authority on the genealogies and histories of all the neighbouring county families with which he busied himself, in pure love of such knowledge, for he was not malicious, he was simply statistical and biographical. He ought to have been a collector and compiler of forgotten facts in the by-paths of history, an editor of old letters,"], [81, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 69 supplying notes to preserve vanishing details, and throw flight on half-forgotten social comedies and tragedies. \"*' I gave Coxe a lift from the station to his place, and we happened to come across this very subject,\" explained -Joe Hobbs; \"I took some interest in it, for \u2014 well \u2014 I used to know the girl's mother,\" beginning to smoke \u25a0again. \" You \u2014 you, Joe ! How7ever did that come about and I never to hear of it?\" cried Mrs. Hobbs, sitting bolt \u25a0upright in a state of amazement, which swallowed up any other primitive sentiment whether of hurt confidence, \u25a0dawning jealousy, or roused suspicion. Joe took a long pull at his pipe, and then took it from his mouth, and stared meditatively at the ashes in the bowl, stirring them tentatively with a little finger, so big, that in looking at it one was reminded of Reho boam's little finger, which he threatened to make bigger than his father Solomon's loins. \" It was a long time ago,\" he said at last, \" long before I ever saw your face, owd lass.\" He spoke broadly then, though, as a rule, his tongue was comparatively cultured, and the old familiar term and accent sounded like words of endearment from his mouth, \" Perhaps I should have told you all about it and her, but it was a subject I never cared to talk about.\" \" You were free to have your secrets, Joe,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with unquestionable dignity; \"only I never dreamed as you had any.\" \" This was not a secret,\" said Joe, stoutly, \"it was what anybody might have known if they had liked, and what some few did know, only I could not stomach bringing up the story for the pleasure of the thing, when there was no profit to be gained that I could see. Me and Bessie Lane were neighbours' children, and knew each other well iu our young days.\" \"Bessie ! \" interrupted Mrs. Hobbs, quickly, \" so that is the reason as you would have our Bessie christened by that name, instead of for your sister Becky ; and may be that is why you have such a favour for the little"], [82, "70 A MORNING MIST. wench,\" she added, dryly, with a momentary flash of her dark eyes. \" Nay, Hannah,\" the great man defended himself,: mildly, \" she is our youngest, and she is liker you than. little Hannah is, or than any daughter we have can pretend to be. But I ought to have spoken out, I see that to-night, for you were never the woman to misjudge me.\" \" I've had no cause, as I knows on, Joe Hobbs,\" said Mis. Hobbs, with her unapproachable dignity, which. verged on haughtiness, and her crushing magnanimity. \" You might knock me down with a feather. If anybody 'cept yourself had said what you telled met to-night I would no more have believed them than I. would have believed the sky were going to fall. But you've been a good master to me, and a good father to. the children, and as to what befell you before you ever set eyes on me, why that is your own matter, if you, choose to keep it close. I do not go with jealousy, on scant grounds, in wives any more than in husbands. To my mind they lets theirselves, as well as their masters,, down to a low level as stoops to jealousy. If they be wronged, deadly, let them go their own way, and say nought about it. It is too bad and sickening to be spoksn. on \u2014 aye, or thought on \u2014 if the miserable women can help it.\" \" Right you are,\" said Joe, in his meditative way ; \"but there are blockheads of men that are cowards in dealing with the troubles of the past, and there are fools, and worse than fools, of women as like to play with pitch and fire. Thank God that you are not one of them, lass; that you are honest and loyal to the core. It was all my fault that you never heard tell of Bessie Lane ; though, when it comes to that, there was nothing much that you would have liked, or that would have done you good to hear in the story, though it might have been a trifle easier to tell then, than at this time o' the day. When I said we were neighbours' chil dren, I did not mean that poor Bessie had a respon sible, kindly father and mother to look after her. Her"], [83, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 71 father and mother were dead and gone, when she was little better than a baby. She was brought up by a brother, nigh twenty years older, and his w7ife \u2014 a child less couple. They meant well, I make no doubt ; but they had no more notion how to rear a child than how to write a poem or paint a picture. Their sole thought was how to keep a tight hold on her, so tight that it would have galled the gentlest creature alive, while it took the spirit and faith out of her, and drove her into paroxysms of fear and ways of deceit. He was a steady, hard-working man, her brother, and I have no reason to think that his wife was not a worthy woman of her kind. The only error that I have to lay to their charge was that they were of an untender nature, and that they grew in hard-fistedness as they grew in years, a failing which their religious profession, as strong Methodists, did not serve to hinder. It was a loveless, gloomy home for Bessie, and she was a lass that craved for all that was bright, and pined for the praises and caresses she never got from her kin. As soon as she was of competent years she made her escape from what was a house of bondage to her, by contriving to take service as a waiting-maid, with a lady of means and position who had come on a visit to the neighbourhood, seen and taken a fancy for Bessie, and carried the girl away with her. \" Bessie had made all her arrangements without con sulting her natural guardians, dreading that they would oppose her intention, and they, with reason, were sadly put about by it. They distrusted the position she had chosen, as one in which she would be exposed to what they held as evil snares, and their pride was hurt by her entering service at all. In spite of their narrow ness they reckoned themselves well-to-do, and above serving-maids or serving men . \" If I had known Bessie's intention in time I should have done what I could to stop it, and I might have succeeded then \u2014 who knows? I was fond of the blue eyed, rosy-cheeked, fair-haired lass, with her fits of gaiety, her nervous apprehensions and panics, and her"], [84, "72 A MORNING MIST. pretty, clinging ways,\" he said, simply, in a sort of wistful appeal to his wife, who, however, sat stiffly silent, and only nodded to him to go on with his story. \" But she did not care one bit for me, as it happened. I daresay I was no more than a clumsy lout of a lad in her eyes, and I think she misjudged and mistrusted all that was best in me \u2014 my quietness for my years, my love of work, and my dogged holding-on to whatever I put my hand and mind to. She thought that I would grow hard and stern like her brother, who had a liking for me. If she had listened to me, it would have been simply as a means of getting away from her brother and sister, and worse misery might have come of it. She went without my knowing that she was going till on the very eve of her starting, and she did not come back for two years, not till the death of the lady she had served, who had petted her, and put her in the place of a confidential servant, but only left her a small legacy, which would not have maintained her for three months, if she had fallen back on her own resources. She liked the ways of her brother's house as little as ever. She was still in terror of his fits of anger, while she shrank from her sister-in-law's constant jibbing and fault finding. Yet Bessie was in no great hurry to provide herself with another situation. I believe she was hesitating desperately, and holding her fate in the balance. I could tell she was wretchedly unhappy. I was, by that time, in circumstances to offer her marriage, and I did so, but she would have nothing to say to me. My opinion, afterwards, was that she had been even then in correspondence with Sir Bandal Beauchamp. He was a distant connection of her late mistress, and had always gone about the house. Its owner had managed to find excuses for his follies and vices, as people in her rank, perhaps more than in any other, are able to overlook such wrong-doing, when it is the deed of one of their own kith and kin.\" \" Joe Hobbs,\" said his wife, with solemn austerity, \"be thankful that you were quit on that girl. Every body knows the kind of friendship as exists between a"], [85, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 73 gentleman and a waiting-maid. Her had her chance, and she refused the honest offer of a working man, as she had knowed all her life. Her might have guessed his merits, if she had not been wilful blind. He meant her fair all round, as she could have seed, if so be she had opened her silly7, sly eyes ; and she preferred the dishonest offers of the gentleman as could not have been fair to her even if he had wanted, since, from what I heard tell at Dinglemouth, his lady-wife as he had quarrelled with, and did not 'bide with for more than a year after the marriage, were then alive. Go down on your pins, Joe Hobbs, every day of your mortal life, and thank God as that light-minded lass on whom you were so left to yourself as to cast your eyes, when you was young and green, would have nought to say to you. Never fail to do that, man, whatever you may have to put up with from the likes o' me.\" \" I do noc say that I am not thankful, Hannah,\" said Joe Hobbs quietly, \" I do know a good wife when I've got her, and I am ready and willing to return thanks for her to her Maker and mine, with the last breath I draw, if that will suffice her.\" He laid down the pipe, which was black and cold between his fingers, and resumed : \" But I do not see that it is our part to judge her, or him either for that matter, and they in their graves for many a year. She was weak and she was reckless. Sir Randal had the finest bearing and the most winning tongue, in his youth and prime, of any man in the country, I have heard tell. The man could speak over his very creditors, and bring those who had lost money by him to forgive him and try him again, time after time. He was the most generous man in the world to his tenants and servants, and kind to the poor, with other people's money I grant you ; but, still, the will was there. He had never learnt to measure his powers, or the crying need there was for him to deny himself. I tell you that man, on the whole, lived beloved and died lamented, though he was ruined out of house and hold, though he stripped his son of his impoverished inheritance, and caused many an innocent"], [86, "74 A MORNING MIST. man and woman to suffer for his sins; yet their con donement of his offences was not clean without reason. We must pay heed to how he was bred, my woman, and not condemn him without bounds. He came of a wild, spendthrift, profligate race, and he was reared with no thought save to please himself, whatever came of it. When poor Bessie was turned adrift; out of her brother's house at last, and told that she was to be thenceforth as one dead to every soul that had belonged to her, he was faithful and pitiful according to his lights. He married her, making her Lady Beauchamp as well as an honest woman, the very day after the news reached him of his first wife's death. It is my belief he married her straight away, lest temptation should arise to prevent him from doing the broken-down, dishonoured woman she was by that time, the tardy justice he could pay her. I have been told that he bore with her sickness and loneliness, her ignorance and foolish fancies \u2014 she was never over wise, poor Bessie ! \u2014 in a manner that was a marvel to those of his associates who did not know his sweet temper, only to witness. He was kind to her to the end, and he had all the wish to provide for her girl, this girl over at Maisonette, born in their wedlock, the only one of their children who, happily for them, survived their infancy. His son, born of his first marriage, is an officer with his regiment in India, Coxe tells me, and is supposed to make his half-sister an allowance out of his pay, and the private means he succeeded to through his mother. For poor Sir Randal's debts far exceeded his assets, and, with the consent of the next heirs, he had broken the entail to his place,. Bairtields, while the mortgages were foreclosed, and the Beauchamps were left landless.\" There was a little pause, for Joe Hobbs did not see himself called upon to proclaim, even to the wife of his bosom, that having heard of Sir Randal's dire extremity, he (Joe Hobbs) had raised the last loan which had per mitted the prodigal to die in his own bed unmolested. The business had been transacted through an agent. The benefactor and the man he had benefited had never"], [87, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 75 exchanged words. Indeed, Sir Randal had not so much as known the style and title of his friend in need, whose identity he had not, in the insouciance which never failed him, spent the little leisure that was left to him in seeking to penetrate. \"Did you ever come across this girl, Joe?\" asked Mrs. Hobbs, with a keen look in her husband's face. \" No, not I,\" answered Joe, with an unruffled counten- ance. He got up, gave his tall, gaunt figure a shake, and put his pipe in the rack. \" I ain't sure that I care to meet her ; but \" \" Yes, I understand, Joe,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, w7ith a. rapid intuition that anticipated the expression of his thought. \" You could not have your old acquaintance and dead sweetheart's child a-living at your door, and she a poor, forlorn orphant, dependent on the bounty of a brother, as has no great cause to care for her, while you are great and prosperous, a mighty man at the head of your family, receiving honour on all hands \u2014 without seeking to lend her your countenance and make life better for she. You would like Mattie and me to call on her, and do what we can for her. I ain't sure as she'll thank either you or me for it, but that's neither here nor there. It won't be my fault if you don't get your way, Joe Hobbs.\" \" Good lass ! \" said Joe Hobbs, emphatically, turning and pressing a hand whose pressure was no light weight on his wife's shoulder. But she did not mind the weight, while she fully appreciated the fact that, though the girl might give her no thanks, she had what was infinitely better worth having \u2014 the admiring gratitude of her husband. The following morning Mrs. Hobbs walked into the particular morning-room which was largely set apait for Mattie's use, where she kept her lending library, her parish \"magazines and district accounts, her little medicine-chest \u2014the contents of which she prescribed in a small way, besides her own books, paints, packets of garden-seeds, and patterns of all kinds. \" Martha Hobbs,\" said her mother ; \" I want you to"], [88, "76 A MORNING MIST. keep yourself free this here afternoon, to bear me company ; I mean to drive to this place with a Frenchified name, and call on your Miss Beauchamp.\" \"You don't say so, mother; are you in earnest?\" \u25a0exclaimed Mattie, opening wide her bright, dark eyes with lively surprise, and a flash of pleasure, which died \u2022down into a look of comical perplexity. \" Are you in earnest? What has made you think of it? It is not just to please me \u2014 is it? It may not be the same Miss Beauchamp, you know; and even if it were, I do not care so much as that comes to. Perhaps the result would be disappointing.\" \" Ax me no questions, Martha Hobbs, and I'll tell you no lies. Howsomever, I'll say this much \u2014 it do be the same Miss Beauchamp, and it ain't to please you as I'm going, Miss Conceit,\" said the mother, with no lack of motherly pride and affection in the mocking tone. \" It is to please myself, and \u2014 well, not you. All the same, I did think as you would have jumped at the proposal.\" \" But, mother, Miss Beauchamp may have no wish for \u2022ourcompany,\" said the puzzled Mattie. \"Indeed, she and her friend have given the only sign in their power, so that it ought to be sufficient, that they have no desire to make our acquaintance. Are you aware, mother, that they have been at Maisonette nearly as many years as we have been months at Kingsmeadows ? It was for them to take the initiative. They were the first to come, \u2022so they ought to have called on us when we settled in the neighbourhood. Instead of that, they are the only neighbours within the same distance who have taken no notice of us. It is rather humiliating to own it, but I'm afraid they have treated us with silent contempt. We \u2022don't mind, of course ; but that does not alter the fact. I have heard they live in retirement, with little or no society, and I suppose it is to please themselves they do it ; it cannot be altogether a question of poverty ; \u25a0even if it were, we could not help them\u2014 they would take no assistance from us. Don't you think it would be in truding on them if we were to call? \" she suggested, a"], [89, "JOE HOBBS IMPARTS HIS RECOLLECTIONS. 77 httle anxiously. For Mattie, though liberal-minded and independent in many respects, was more fettered by social rules than her mother would ever be. \" Stuff and nonsense ! \" cried the hardy Philistine, scornfully, \"there ain't no good in standing on cere mony, when there is summat friendly as may be done. ' Better late than never,' says I, and if they haven't the grace to begin, then we mun show them the example, that's all. Your father knowed Miss Beau champ's mother, it seems, and he wishes to show as he hasn't forgot that.\" \" Oh, that alters the case ! \" said Martha, in a tone of relief, for though she was not very particular about etiquette in her own person, she was too sensible, and had too much knowledge of the world, as it is, not to think that it would be a matter for regret if her mother were to pose in the eyes of the county as the great boiler-maker's wife, who knew* no better than to set the forms of civilized society at defiance. \"What an odd chance that father should have known Lady Beauchamp, the invalid lady we saw at Dinglemouth. How did it come about ? You never spoke of it before.\" \" Because I never heard tell of it till last night ; but there weren't no oddness about it,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, in her brusque way. \" There was none so high a step between her family and his'n \u2014 your father's \u2014 afore she ran off with Sir Randal Beauchamp.\" \" That explains,\" said Mattie, with her nimble wits and thoughtful intelligence, \"the slighting way she was spoken of, I remember, and the foolish dress of the child.\" \"I dare say,\" assented Mrs. Hobbs, dryly, \" and if you'll take my advice, you won't look too far into a millstone. Mind, there ain't to be no question made of father's acquaintance with the girl's mother, neither to her nor to nobody. He did not forbid it, but it might be awkward-like, and her might not like it.

The next instant she raised them again, and looked with an eager, irresistible appeal into her mother's face. \"We must do all we can for my poor little lady,\" she said, with a quickly-drawn breath, and a reflection of young Joe's wistful, fervent generosity in her look, \"if she is suffering for the offences of others.\""], [91, "CHAPTER VII. THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. A great change had come over Constance Beauchamp \u25a0since she was the high-spirited, spoilt child of seven years of age, building sand castles, and clearing the way for rivers, with little regard for briny consequences, on the sands at Dinglemouth, under the fond, foolish, .gaze of her mother, spurred on by the jovial voice of her father, and watched with a scandalized mixture of loud \u25a0condemnation and secret, fearful admiration by her self constituted judges, the respectable vulgar public of the little watering-place. It was not the losses and depri vations which had befallen her that had altered her. She had been too young to realise their meaning even in the case of the last \u2014 the death of her father \u2014 which had occurred when she was ten years of age. It was the twelve years' course of repression which she had under gone that had converted the active-minded child into a singularly quiet, still, and passive girl in her tw7enty-first year. The quietness and stillness were very much an acquired mask, for it is hard for any discipline to root \u2022out of a nature what belongs to its very essence. But the mask was to a great extent entire and un hroken, and it would have been difficult for a spectator, unless one wbo had been taken behind the scenes \u2014 nay, unless one who had been permitted to penetrate into the deep and hidden recesses of that restless, way ward thing, the human heart \u2014 to judge what anguish of sensitive feeling, what storms of rebellious passion, might some day burn and rage behind the soft, calm exterior."], [92, "80 A MORNING MIST. Twelve years before, not long after the days at. Dinglemouth, while Lady Beauchamp still dragged out a doomed life, Miss Letitia West had come as governess to little Miss Beauchamp ; whether the family stayed at their place of Fairfields, which was still in Sir Ran dal's possession then, or in some hired, inferior country house, or at some showy London or tawdry foreign hotel. Miss West had accepted the situation reluc tantly, and with many scruples. For she was a woman to whose upright, decorous soul, as upright and infi nitely more decorous than Mrs. Hobbs's soul, the sor rowful, disgraceful passages in poor Lady Beauchamp's history, still more than her humble birth, and the gay and graceless reputation of Sir Randal, were extremely repugnant. But the times were bad, Miss West was poor, and she was reduced to accept the only post within her reach. After she had accepted it, the milk of human kindness in her was so unadulterated and so perennial in its flow, though its channel was somewhat narrow and the banks tame, that she grew full of com passion and even of regard for a penitent dying woman. Lady Beauchamp, in her latter days, was the most humble-minded, heart-broken Christian Miss West had ever known. The unfortunate woman was conscious that her weakness and selfishness had wrecked her own fate, and gone far to mar the lives of such relations as she had possessed, had consummated the ruin of her husband, whom she loved to the last, and laid the foundation of the humiliation of the daughter she idolized. Miss West also grew full of commiseration and affec tion for her little pupil, who was sentenced to be a vic tim to the sins of others. More than that, Miss West, to her own astonishment and a good deal to her affront, had a corner in her heart for the gracious vagabond Sir Randal. After Lady Beauchamp's death Miss West continued \u2014 once more to her surprise and discomfiture \u2014 to be Miss- Beauchamp's governess. The fact was, that the elderly woman could not bring herself to forsake the"], [93, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 81 friendless, helpless child, for whom no protectress was to be found among her father's kindred \u2014 their patience had been exhausted ages ago. Miss West had not many iriends of her own to advise with her, or feel aggrieved by any course she chose to pursue, which was not justified by prudent self-consideration Possibly she had the more sympathy on that account with her lonely charge. To do Sir Randal justice \u2014 granted that the company to which he was reduced and his practices were no more to be admired in the end than in the beginning, though their \u25a0objectionable side consisted rather in the easy, dibonnaire manner in which he met the result of his follies than in the -commission of fresh follies \u2014 he always treated Miss West with respect and courteous consideration. He showed him- self sincerely grateful for her fidelity to the small daughter whom he loved better than anything else on earth, while his love just stopped short of being the curse to her that it had been to the other creatures he had cared for in his downhill career. Sir Randal, as Mr. Hobbs had said, \u25a0did his best in the sorry plight in which he found himself to make a suitable provision for his daughter and along with her for Miss West. When remonstrated with on the last act of generosity as being rendered unjustifiable by the lamentably crippled state of his finances, he had answered indignantly that it had always been the custom in the Beauchamp family to purchase annuities for their governesses. Let who must suffer by his unlucky ini- pecuniosity, it should not be a lady who had honourably discharged her duty to a Miss Beauchamp. He was so determined on this point that he peformed a feat he had not accomplished for years. When part of the last loan which he was able to obtain came into his hands, in place -of hastening to misapply it on the indulgences of the hour, he walked straight off from the harpies of dishonest money-lenders and low lawyers who preyed upon him, and entered on the negotiation which terminated in a modest annuity for Miss West. On Sir Randal's death, however, little cr nothing of the sum which he had sought to set aside for his daughter G"], [94, "82 A MORNING MIST. could be secured. The resources of the man, who when he had succeeded to Fairfield3 had entered on a large though encumbered income of twelve thousand a yearr Were in inextricable confusion, and drained dry by pressing claims. Miss West had found herself compelled, in the face of her little annuity, to write to Sir Randal's son, who had succeeded to the bare baronetcy, and was an officer with his regiment in India, to bespeak his aid for his step sister. Sir John, whom Miss West had hardly ever seen, as he was brought up by his mother's relations, had granted her request, in a letter which explained in a few words why the pittance he furnished was so infinitesimal. Young Beauchamp was now the head of the family, and did not deny the obligations which the position entailed, but he had not profited, in a monetary sense, in the slightest degree, by the death of Sir Randal, which in other circumstances would have made his ton master of Fairfields, and supplied him with the means of dis charging ordinary debts. The entail was broken, the money which the successive mortgages represented wa3 spent. Sir John himself had to depend on his inadequate pay in his soldier's career, in an expensive regiment in what threatened to be times of peace. He had nothing else save what had reverted to him of his mother's portion on the death of his maternal grandfather. From the time of her father's death Constance Beau champ had, by the wish of her brother, it was under stood, continued to live under the care of her governess, though the girl's education had been ostensibly finished for the last year or two. For eight years the lady and girl had occupied Maisonette, so that they were perfectly well known by name and in the outline of their history to such purveyors of social information as Major Coxe and Co. At the same time, Miss West and Miss Beauchamp were little more than names, with stories attached, to their neighbours in the country houses round. There were two reasons for this. There was something ambiguous in poor Constance Beau champ's position. It was not known how far her half-"], [95, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 83 brother, who was all right, in so far as his mother had been a lady of good repute, would acknowledge her, while her mother's origin and story were well enough known. It might be that she was likely to be mixed up with her relations on the mother's side, and dragged down by them. It would be awkward, especially for young people of her own age and set, to know a girl in such doubtful circumstances. As for the people who could afford to be more compassionate, or less careful in formiug their acquaintances, they were mostly foiled by* the determination of Miss West, as Miss Beauchamp's guardian, to live in complete retirement and visit no one. Even the zealous Rector and his wife could make nothing of the ladies at Maisonette. Miss Beauchamp had not a word to say for herself. Miss West success fully resisted every effort to draw herself and her charge into parish work \u2014 such as that under which the ladies, old and young, in a well-worked parish, in the latter half of this nineteenth century, are invited to walk, staggering. She declined to joiu working - parties, missionary meetings, mothers' meetings, little official gatherings at the Rectory. She would take no active part in Church decorations and school feasts. She went so far as to look surprised and offended, as if a liberty had been taken with Miss Beauchamp, when it was suggested that the young lady might spend some of the lagging hours of her unbounded leisure in following the advice of the poet \u2014 no less than of the parson \u2014 \" Go, teach the orphan hoy to read And teach the orphan girl to sew, aud add the Church of England Temperance Society's mandates, and the requirements of Church Music to the curriculum. Miss West might have been excused for having arrived at the conclusion that the Board school had rid her and her pupil of some of these onerous tasks ; but the prin cipal cause for her entire supineness, and passive resist-"], [96, "84 A MORNING MIST. ance to the assaults made on her was that she was an old-fashioned woman, even for her years. She had grown up in parishes where Christian example was sup posed to consist of reading the Bible, saying her prayers in all sincerity, attending Church on her own account \u2014 in short, working out her own salvation with fear and trembling, and presenting, ),o far as she could, tbe fair spectacle of a consistent walk and conversation \u2014 pure, honest, modest, and gentle, as her not unworthy contri bution to parish Christianity. She had not been brought up to spending her life in invading the territories of her neighbours, and reforming their abuses. As to visiting, she was not acquainted with Captain Beauchamp's wishes for his sister in this respect, and, being an eminently cautious woman, Miss West abstained from all company, lest she should offend in some. Above all, she was sensible that the income enjoyed at Maisonette was not nearly enough to enable Miss Beauchamp, under her \"friend's\" chaperonags, to mix in county \u25a0society on equal terms with her neighbours. The proud, reserved woman did not choose that the young girl, to \"whom she had devoted her life, should enter it on other terms. Miss West did not ask herself what might or might not he the result of this course ; she was a woman who, in her rare integrity, was not merely incapable of plotting and scheming, but even of what might have been con sidered a warrantable amount of calculation and fore sight. Olgi-l... It was difficult to imagine what Constance Beauchamp wrould have been without her vigilant keeper, Miss West ; it remains to be seen what Miss West had made of her charge, after twelve years of conscientious \u25a0care. Maisonette was the daintiest of little maiden houses, deriving its daintiness, not from the costliness of its furniture, but from the delicate simplicity of its details. The white dimity of its drawing-room and bedrooms was as much out of date as were the handsome, sombre, in destructible damask and mahogany, and many plied"], [97, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 85 Brussels carpets \u2014 which were not without a crowded, oppressive effect, within the very moderate limits of the ladies' dining-room. The bookcases were only of varnished pine, and the bedsteads of brass-tipped iron, but the shelves of the one were lined \u2014 not with the books from Mudie's, which did not receive quite such honour able treatment, but with sets of classics, English, French, and Italian\u2014 Miss West had been just a little too early for German \u2014 in fragrant Russian leather and ivory white morocco ; and the frameworks of the other were piled with soft, billowy down-beds, blaukets in their yellowing age, like white cloth which had not been woven for genera tions, and sheets of the texture of the \" Hollands fine \" of old ballads. The very garden of Maisonette, blossoming over with the flowers which young Joe Hobbs and his sister had admired, was a garden belonging to the past, with shady grassy walks, broad borders, and beds. Farther off, for a background, clumps of rhododendrons, Portugal laurels, lilacs, laburnums, and hawthorns, pretending to form a thicket at the one side, at the other a small rose garden. In the front of the house, geometrical figures cut in the smoothly-shaven turf, and ablaze with gay, cheap annuals and common geraniums. In the not very remote distance the lawn merged into a paddock, from which it was separated by a rustic fence. The paddock was supposed to afford grazing for the elderly horse which ambled between the shafts of the ladies' ph\u00e6ton, and it sometimes contained in addition that antiquated piece of sentimentality \u2014 a pet lamb. There was another object almost as antique as the sturdy lamb, which one is thankful to say had neither a sky-blue riband nor a flowery chain round its woolly neck. Erected in the far corner, so as not to be dangerously in the way of horse and lamb, was a target with its bull's-eye and round rings, not weather-beaten and dropping to pieces, as it ought to have been, but triumphant in fresh black and white paint, standing as steady as a rock on its stout foundations. It was a proclamation that here at Maisonette was still played, for exercise and recreation,"], [98, "86 A MORNING MIST. not romping lawn-tennis, nor even dawdling croquet, but the stately and decorous pastime of archery. Miss West and Miss Beauchamp were both in the drawing-room. They had returned from their afternoon drive, as if they had achieved the performance by clock work, and as if they were impelled to the perfection of punctuality, by the binding consideration that a large household was dependent on their movements, and at least half-a-dozen grown-up people besides children, dogs, and cats, were waiting impatiently for the pair, in order to enjoy the refreshment of afternoon tea. There was a vague likeness between the two, such as is apt to grow up in connection with a couple who have lived long together in a seldom interrupted tete-a-tete. Yet originally the women had possessed hardly a feature or shade of expression in common. Miss West was a tall, large woman, soberly but rather richly dressed in clothes which, like the famous Mrs. Primrose's wedding gown, would \" wear well.\" She had an erect carriage, and at the first glance a somewhat harsh face ; looking closer and longer it was easy to detect that the chief grounds for the impression of harshness were a swarthy complexion \u2014 not improved by the pallor of over sixty years of age \u2014 and heavy eyebrows, which had remained a dull black when the hair had grown a dead grey. There was also a chilly, defensive air, which had to do with an originally shy, silent nature, and the necessity laid upon Miss West to make her own way in the world\u2014 a process doubly difficult to a woman of her temper. Constance Beauchamp was neither tall nor large ; she w*as rather under the middle height, and so slightly made that she looked doubly girlish. There was some thing comical in the unconscious imitation with which she drew up her slender figure, after the fashion in which Miss West dealt with her more massive propor tions. Constance had inherited her mother's hair and complexion \u2014 for that matter they had also been her father's. The Beauchamps for a generation or two had been as uniformly sanguine and florid in the hue of"], [99, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 87 vtiheir locks, and in their flesh-tints, as the Royal Tudors were wont to show themselves. But in individual cases there were modifications. What was the condition of \u2022the complexion of the \"Sleeping Beauty\" when she awoke from her century's slumber, we wonder? Had her hair waxed paler and dimmer in the shade ? Were her big blue eyes more full of dreamy visions than of living images? Constance Beauchamp had not spent -her time on a poppy-strewn couch, in a hushed and darkened room, aud yet even in spite of the overgrown pet lamb, and the solitary archery practice, timed to a minute, as every act was in the extremely regular house, and the daily drive in fine weather, her state \u25a0bore a considerable resemblance to that of the heroine \u25a0of old romance. There was an indoor look, a blanching of the bright colour to something waxen in the fainter pink of the balsam cheeks, a slight droop in what \u25a0ought to have been the elasticity of youth. The eyes held endless wonder, and a half-wistful, half-startled questioning in their blue depths. Life had been so sus pended, so baffling to the girl. Constance had an implicit trust in Miss West, and a great affection for her who had been the most unswerv ing friend she had known. But it was so strange for a girl to have no other friends than her old governess. Constance was an orphan, to be sure, she told herself; but there were other girls who had the misfortune to be orphans, yet who could still claim circles of relations \u2014 brothers aud sisters, uncles and aunts and cousins. Constance had a brother, but he was a great deal older than she ; he was in India, and even before he had left this country she had no recollection, strange to say, of ever having seen him. When he wrote, at considerable intervals, to Maisonette, his letters were addressed to Miss West, as if she and not Constance were his rela tion, and Miss West did not even make the letters common property, though she generally imparted the greater part of their contents to the sister of the writer. Neither did she attempt to account for the preference given to herself as a correspondent. Naturally Con-"], [100, "88 A MORNING MIST. stance's letters in return were mere formal school-girl! records of the weather and of her monotonous round o& occupations and studies. Constance was as sure of her old governess's unfailing regard for her as she was of her own existence \u2014 in fact, she never doubted it. She had an instinctive perception that Miss West had never cared so much for any other creature as she had cared for her, or been so indulgent,, in Miss West's dignified, undemonstrative way, to any other human being as she was to the girl whom she had brought up, trained, \" mothered,\" since Constance, as a. child of eight years of age, lost her own mother. But there were points on which Miss West was abso lutely unapproachable ; among these were Constance's connections and prospects. Was she never to reach the age when she should know all about her people, her father's misfortunes, and what was to become of herself \u2014 whether she was to live all her life with this one friend ;. whether she was never to go into company as other girls went; never to have friends of her own age and share with them the associations, interests, and pleasures of youth ? She had been a lonely child, she had grown up a lonely girl ; was the loneliness never to have an end ? Constance had finished her education two years. before, though Miss West still took care that, as she said, her pupil should keep up her languages and music in due proportion. Actually, there was nothing left of serious occupation for Constance save these few pages of French and Italian to read and translate, that half- hour of solid reading as if she had something to do with the University Extension Scheme, which Miss West never dreamt of for her \u2014 that early morning practice. She had nothing that she knew of to wait for. Things happened elsewhere, but nothing ever happened at Maisonette. There was no change there, except the changes of the seasons. Constance's life was one pro tracted spell of vague expectation \u2014 a little sickening in the degree to which it was drawn out, sometimes resulting in restlessness, and what was yet the hardly7 visible, quickly-mastered ghost of frantic resistance and"], [101, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. Stv revolt, but more frequently in the listless, submissive pliancy of a tender, immature nature. Constance was young for her years, and she was more imaginative than practical, else she would somehow have overleaps the barrier of her position, and arrived, with whatever humiliation and anguish, at a nearer approximation to the truth in her history. All the sign that she showed of the slightest suspicion of evil, as well as strangeness, in what had produced the difference between her lot and that of other girls was a certain shrinking from pressing for the information which was withheld from her, to which she was entitled on the questions which concerned her. She had not only been brought up to take no liberties with her nearest friend, she was not merely incapable of thrusting forward her claims to confidence, she was timidly resigned to her ignorance. She remembered comparatively little of the mother whom she had only known as an invalid, from whom her child was always kept, more or less, in order that she might not tease or tire the sick woman. Constance's father, who had been her gay supporter and backer on all occasions, her merry playfellow, she remembered a good deal better. She clung with passionate devotion to what she could recall of his handsome face and figure, though it must have been in the sere and yellow leaf, his winning manners, the lingering exquisite grace of the earlier years of the century, which marked the \" last of the dandies,\" his inextinguishable cheerfulness and kindness. She could also remember something of the imposing dimensions and style of Fairfields. It had been his place, the home of his ancestors and hers, before he was forced to give it up \u2014 poor father ! \u2014 and retire to the shabby town and country houses and foreign hotels in which he stayed for the greater part of his later days. Fairfields might be out of the family, but it had by no means died out of Constance's mind. She had an exaggerated idea of what its grandeur had been in its palmy days, and a tenacious pride in the knowledge that she had once belonged to it ; that if her father had not been ruined and stripped of his own by"], [102, "90 A MORNING MIST. his lavish generosity, and by the snares which crafty, dishonest men had laid for him, she would still have been a daughter of Fairfields, basking in its aristocratic privileges. Something happened at last at Maisonette ; though, as usually occurs when long-delayed events come to pass, it was not anything that Constance Beauchamp had looked for or could care for, even in the light of a small variety. When Miss West and her charge returned one afternoon from their stereotyped drive and went into the drawing-room, they found that cards had been left for them in their absence \u2014 somebody had called. But the somebody, on a little examination, turned out to be nobody who could tempt Miss West from her exclusiveness, and induce her to break her rule \u25a0of not visiting with her neighbours \u2014 nobody who had any excuse for troubling her and Constance by their advances. \" The new family from Kingsmeadows,\" said Miss West, in her deliberate, rather ponderous way of looking at social trifles and deciding upon them, \" what could bring them here ? I am inclined to think there must be some mistake.\" \" Is not Mr. Hobbs in trade ? \" asked Constance, with the gentlest, laziest disdain, so gentle and lazy that it was scarcely aggressive. \" Are people \u2014 I mean people like us \u2014 expected to visit Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs if they visit at all?\" looking at the perfectly plain cards specu latively rather than superciliously, and raising her voice as she pronounced the one-syllabled plebeian aarne. \" Well, yes, when a man is so rich and renowned in his trade as this great boiler-maker. But I cannot -understand why his wife and daughter should think of \u2022calling here, when, even if they have not heard that we op nowhere, we did not call on them.\" \" I suppose they know no better,\" said Constance, \u25a0coolly and simply, and without a tinge of intentional in solence as she took up a little parcel of cambric handker chiefs, on each of which she was embroidering the initials of her name, with a delicate elaboration which"], [103, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 91 left the average duration of human life entirely out of count. \"I should think they know rather more than that comes to,\" corrected Miss West, with a slight smile. \"\"Very rich people who are welcomed into every rank nowadays have great advantages, my dear. And it is their own fault if they do not know a great deal more than theordinary rules of society, in marshalling company in what were considered the two great dividing lines when I was young, in table-etiquette, and the rest of it. Probably, Miss Hobbs is more adroit with her wine glasses, better acquainted with the last novelty in entrees, and shows finer skill in floral decorations than either you or I can boast.\" \"Very likely,\" said Constance, indifferently. \"You and I never go out, you know7, and our field of observa tion at home is decidedly circumscribed. What a tiny dining-room we have here to what I can remember of the dear old Fairfields dining-room ! I can see it, at this moment, with the portrait of the man in armour at one end and the lady dressed as a shepherdess at the other. I daresay these Hobbses have their knights and shepherdesses also, fresh from Wardour-street, of which I have read many a time. But I think I should have more respect for them if they were not so very well supplied, and so ultra-refined with the last gloss of fashion.\" Constance had made, without being sensible of it, an inconsistent as wellas an illiberal speech. In the narrow groove in which she had been reared, and out of which she had not swerved by a hair's-breadth, she had failed to make an allowance for the varying standards of her neighbours. The slightest departure from her ow-i code of speech and behaviour was liable to offend, nay, to shock her. \" What shall we do? Shall we take no notice of these cards ? \" she inquired after an interval of a few minutes, looking up from her work, and catching another glimpse of the pasteboard credentials in the fiberree basket. Generally, it stood ready in the hall, and so seldom received any other cards than those of the"], [104, "92 A MORNING MIST. Rev. C. Parry and Mrs. Parry, and of Dr. Mason, the Rivermeadows doctor, that an impressionable parlour maid, struck by the last deposit, had carried it bodily into the drawing-room, and placed it, with its unusual trophy, in a prominent situation on one of the little tables. Miss West had taken up the netting which, though netting-needles, like distaffs and spindles, are no longer to be found in ordinary fancy shops, she declined to relinquish for more modern work. The fidelity of her adherence was not due altogether to the extent of her antediluvian attainments as a netter. She was a woman who had put special weight on a fine figure and a majestic carriage. Her sight had given way, so that even with the aid of spectacles she could not engage in sewing unless she consented to indulge in any amount of un graceful, apparently negligent, and unquestionably in jurious stooping. She had never learned to knit. To sit idle in her drawing-room was a bad example for Constance, and went against Miss West's conscience. She could still net, with her foot in a netting-stirrup, and keep her back as straight as that of a drill-sergeant. What became of all her netting, whether it was entirely consumed in mats for fish and fruit dishes, and coarse pinafores for pie-dishes, whether she presented it as a characteristic offering to bazaars, Constance, in the obliviousness of her youthful day-dreaming, had never sought to ascertain. Miss West, in the course of her evolutions, was changing a flat ivory for a round steel pin, and she made the transference before she replied : \"Not exactly, Constance. We must remember that Mrs. Hobbs is a married woman, no longer young, and mistress of a house like Kingsmeadows, though she may* be out of place in the character. Something is due to her. Besides, we owe it to ourselves, or rather you owe it to yourself, not to fail in courtesy. I have no doubt the call is meant for Miss Beauchamp. I am only your old governess and present chaperon.\" \" If she is not enough of a lady to recognise that you are a lady \u2014 a far better lady than she is, which is saying"], [105, "THE INMATES OF THE MAISONETTE. 93 little \u2014 and the mistress here, I don't wish to have any thing to do with her,\" cried Constance, with a spurt of indignant feeling that brought the red of a rose for a moment into her cheek. \" I am much obliged to you, my love,\" said Miss West, unbending affectionately, \"still, there are long-standing \u25a0opinions \u2014 decrees, I may say \u2014 of society which we have no right either to deny or to overthrow. I am quite old and -wise enough to see they are for the good of the many. I have no quarrel with the world because I have never been anybody to speak of in it. My father was only a respectable country attorney. I was poor, and had to earn my bread. I had not even the advantage of exceptional good looks, or great talents, or better-class relations, on whom I could fall back. Why should the wife of even a boiler-maker call on me, as she has called on you \u2014 the daughter of the late Sir Randal Beau champ ? Then, since you are the object of her atten tions, and you are a young girl while she is a middle aged married woman, I think it would only be becoming \u2022on your part to leave your card at Kingsmeadows, in return for what was doubtless intended as a compliment to you. I shall drive over with you, and the matter can end there. We were out when Mrs. and Miss Hobbs called, but w*e shall not ask if they are at home when \u2022we return their call. We shall simply make Thomas get down and hand in our cards, and the family will be stupid, indeed, if they do not understand from our behaviour that we are declining their acquaintance.\" \"Very well, you know best,\" answered Constance, putting down her work and taking up a book, without the least desire to dispute Miss West's fiat. Constance might have had stirrings of heart, with regard to the overtures of other neighbours, which Miss JtVest had seen fit to reject, but the girl had neither ex pectations nor wishes where the family of a boiler maker were concerned. The name of Hobbs had not recalled any association to her mind. She had as reten tive a memory as Mattie Hobbs had, but the experience of the girls had been reversed since the days, which"], [106, "94 A MORNING MIST. seemed so far off to the young women, in which they had encountered each other at Dinglemouth. That had been the eventful period of Constance Beauchamp's life and the quiescent time of Mattie Hobbs's primitive childhood. The rising master-mechanic's daughter had been much at home, had followed a humdrum round of homely duties, overshadowed by the early losses in the family circle. The visit to Dinglemouth, the spectacle of the little lady who was suffered to dig in the sand in her drawing-room finery, had been eras which had bulked largely in the childish imagination, and left their indelible mark there. The ruined gentleman's daughter had been taken from place to place, had seen many strange faces, and passed through more exciting adventures than plunging her bronze slippers into a pool of sea-water, and having her feet dried by a little rustic who volunteered the service. Little Constance, used to better qualified attendants \u2014 to the lively flatteries of French chambermaids, to the picturesque looks and words of Italian domestics, to the grotesque stolidity and clumsiness of improvised German servants \u2014 saw7 nothing remarkable in little Martha Hobbs running to her aid, and awkwardly mopping her shoes and stockings. She forgot the whole circumstance in a moment in the rush of new movements. All that had changed. From the time of her father's death Constance had led an utterly monotonous, wholly un broken life, while Mattie had been pursuing her many sided education, and rising to the level of her father and mother's new responsibilities."], [107, "CHAPTER VIII. CONSTANCE AND MISS WEST'S MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOWS. The ladies from Maisonette set out as they had pro posed on their errand of compulsory politeness. Though they had no intention of alighting from their chariot and coming to the front, as it were, for inspection, on the part of their ignorantly officious neighbours, Miss West and Constance were in every detail of the expedi tion, including their costumes, altogether according to rule. Miss West never abated a jot of what propriety required on such occasions, though they were few and far between, and the performance was little better than a make-believe at visiting, unless, indeed, the visitors and the visited had happened to belong to the very select circles which indulge in hall porters and visiting books. She would have thought that she had failed in her duty to Miss Beauchamp if she had, for any induce ment short of the demands of the moral law and the necessary steps for the preservation of life, relaxed a single obligation to society, such as Miss West under stood it. She had seen the world, if it were only from the back windows. She had been in what were called \" high situations \" before she entered Sir Randal Beauchamp's household. She had made her observations from the discreet distance of the schoolroom, and for that very reason her notions, besides being old-fashioned, were more rigorous than they would have been had Miss West been born to the manner and tone of the circles she contemplated a long way off. She and Miss Beauchamp were very poor for the latter's rank by"], [108, "96 A MORNING MIST. birth, so that they had to affect the virtue, if they had it not, of extreme simplicity of taste in dress and equipage. But, withal, the phaeton and pony were in good condition; Thomas, in his half-livery and driving gloves, was quite presentable, and Miss West was a suitably-dressed, elderly lady, in the carefully-preserved, handsome costume, which she found the most economical, while only a penetrating eye could detect its age. As for Constance, she was totally unlike the little fantasti cally over-dressed Constance of Dinglemouth sands. Nobody could accuse her nowadays of being like either an actress or an aspiring milliner's apprentice. She bore a greater resemblance to a young French aristocrat, fresh from her convent. She wore a studiously plain cambric morning gown, a broad flapping hat \u2014 a rustic hat, clearly meant for shade and nothing else, so that it would have been as great an error for it to have ex hibited any mark of fashionable distinction as it would have been for a garden hat to have been furnished with nodding plumes, or tufts of French flowers, or coquettish hows and ends of dainty ribands. Just when the phaeton drove up to the great gates of Kingsmeadows, with their cottage ornee \u2014 the porter's lodge nearly as big as Maisonette, Thomas turned round deprecatingly to Miss West. He had to tell her that a misfortune had happened to \" Captain.\" He had cast a shoe, and was already preparing to go a little lame in \u25a0consequence, since his off fore-foot had always been a weak point with him. Thomas, like all who served Miss West, was aware that she was a strict disciplin arian, but he also knew that she was fair and reasonable \u2014 for a lady. She would not be one who would refuse to admit that an accident might happen, even to the most careful \" coachman.\" She would take it into considera tion that he had been thoughtful not to fret her with news of the trouble till she was at her destination, where she would only have to stay making her call till he led \" Captain \" to the smithy, half a mile in advance on the London road, and had him put right. Thomas was not sure that he had ever known Miss West and Miss"], [109, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOWS. 97 Beauchamp go anywhere save shopping at Rivermeadows and Dorrington. Now that they had begun to pay visits it stood to reason, to Thomas's reason, that they would make a pretty long one when they were about it. He was taken by surprise when Miss West told him peremptorily that she had never had any intention of getting out of the phaeton, and that he must make Captain go home as he had come. \" But you don't think, miss, that I brought him out in this state,\" remonstrated Thomas, with injured feelings, standing in full view of the porter's lodge, and entering his protest against attempting to go home without having Captain set right. \" It ain't possible unless you would have him made dead lame and unfit to go in har ness for the better part of the summer. Having such a tender off fore-foot as he have, he don't ought to be treated without consideration,\" wound up Thomas, re proachfully. He was both honest and humane in his sturdy way. He was also deeply imbued with the per suasion that horses were men's business, with which no woman ought to meddle, except to ask the man's advice and follow his lead in the matter. \" Why did you not tell me when you saw something was wrong ? \" demanded Miss West, in increasing annoy ance. \" Miss Beauchamp and I might have come out then and walked home, while you could have left the phaeton by the roadside if necessary and gone on with the horse to the smithy. That would have been greatly preferable to bringing us on here.\" \" If I had knowed,\" muttered Thomas, with a suspicion of sulkiness ; \" it were no pleasure to me to bring on the poor brute in this state.\" \"Thomas,\" said Miss West, severely, \"mind what you are saying. I will not have you, or the oldest and most valued servant at Maisonette, give me a saucy answer.\" \" Well then, Miss West,\" resumed Thomas, doggedly, \" it would have been a matter of five miles for you and Miss Beauchamp to walk back, and I can't tell as either 7"], [110, "98 A MORNING MIST. of you are fit for such a tramp, not in such weather. It is a thing to be main thankful for that you are within reach of shelter. It ain't the hood of the phaeton as would have kept off what is up in them clouds, ready to fall on our heads the next minute,\" with a secretly triumphant wave of the arm in the direction of an inky cloud which had suddenly sailed into view overhead, marring the harmony of the summer sky. Miss West was too sensible to protract the usless dis cussion. With however much reluctance and qualms of vexation, she was preparing to alight, when a gentleman, whom Constance had seen all along keeping himself modestly out of view in the porter's lodge, hastened forward to assist the ladies to get down, and to relieve them from the unknown difficulty which was evidently under discussion, and seemed to be impeding their further progress. He was a pleasant-looking young man, not strictly handsome, but with the stamp of good breeding. He was not strictly at his ease either, for he had the nervous, excitable air of a man who cannot take even trifles quietly, while he was without the stammer ing mauvais honte or the forced spasmodic assurance of the lout who has not been accustomed to mix freely with educated men and women. \" I beg your pardon,\" he said, with a smile and an involuntary twitch of his moustache ; \" I think you are the ladies from Maisonette, whom my mother and sister will be very glad to see. If you choose to walk instead of to drive up the avenue will you allow me to show you the way? \" Miss West could not help herself, and she would not be outdone in strict politeness. \" Young Mr. Hobbs, I presume?\" she suggested, as intrepidly as if she had \u25a0come there to make the acquaintance of all the Hobbses in turn. \"Miss Beauchamp, Mr. Hobbs.\" The per former of the introduction was provoked to see that the bow of Sir Randal Beauchamp's daughter was not only slight and stiff, it had a ridiculous tremor in it, a shade of agitation which communicated itself with equal absurdity to the bow of the boilermaker's son, though"], [111, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOWS. 99 he was behaving in every other respect as if he were the son of the lord-lieutenant, or of the nearest marquis or duke. But what could be expected from a poor girl to whom strangers who were her social equals were as rare an experience as the prince who came to arouse her from her dreams must have been to the Sleeping Beauty ? ' ' I cannot say that our walking up your avenue is a matter of choice, sir\"; Miss West's unpliable tongue still employed the term \" sir.\" She might have added, with similar truth, that neither was it by her will she and Constance had quitted the stronghold of the phaeton, and were, at that moment, preparing to walk up the fine carefully kept lime avenue of Kingsmeadows, escorted by the son of the house. Thus they were bound to cross its threshold, and ex change with its owners the ordinary civilities of society, which they would return in the same style, establishing a regular visiting acquaintance between the Hobbs family and Miss Beauchamp, which, if once begun, it would be difficult to stamp out of some form of struggling exist ence. Miss West did not go so far in her explanation ; she checked an impatient sigh, and said briefly: \" Our servant has been so careless as to bring out our horse without seeing to his shoes, one of which must have been loose. There is no resource save to take the animal to the smithy, and in the meantime I am afraid we must trespass on your hospitality.\" She spoke with the solemn ceremonious courtesy with which a queen \u2014 every inch a queen \u2014 might have intimated that she would avail herself of an honoured subject's house in tbe course of a royal progress. Constance did not see herself called on to say a word. \"Don't mention it,\" said Joe Hobbs, speaking all the more pleasantly and easily, with a natural graciousness indeed, when he found the situation put on the footing of a favour to be asked and granted ; \"I heard my mother and Mattie say something of having called at Maisonette, and I took it for granted that you were"], [112, "100 A MORNING MIST. being so good as to return their visit. If you will allow me I will go back and tell your man to take your horse to the stables, instead of making him go on to the smithy ; that will avoid the risk of further damage to him. One of the stable lads can ride over and fetch the smith. When I come to think of it, if you will give us leave, either my sister or I will drive you home, or my mother can take you back in the carriage, so that your horse may rest for an hour or two, before he tries the road again.\" This was worse and worse, as implying yet more familiar terms, while Miss West could only state it as her decided opinion that her horse would be perfectly able to perform the little journey after he was re-shod. She had not even the consolation of telling herself that the upstart was pushing or intrusive in his offers. What ever his mother and sister might have been in breaking in upon the dignified seclusion of Maisonette he was simply courteous, with the additional empressement which would move any gentleman, in connection with two ladies in a difficulty without male support in the back ground. Joe Hobbs conducted the visitors through the spacious hall, which reminded Constance of the fondly-remem bered hall at Fairfields, except that, as she was forced to recall, there everything had been more or less worn out, and had shown traces of compulsory neglect and reckless ill-usage \u2014 here everything, without being obtru sively lacquered over with restorations and improve ments, was in perfect repair and excellent order ; up one of the flights of the horse-shoe staircase, into the first of a suite of drawing-rooms and library, far beyond any comparison that an inexperienced girl, or even her better informed friend, could bring to bear on it. In Miss West's day, before she was attached to the fortunes of the Beauchamps, there had not been anything like these soft, subdued dyes, sumptuous stuffs, and graceful shapes. To Constance, whose latent love of beauty was at once an instinct and a passion, the place was a revelation, from the softly-tinted ceiling and the high, niched"], [113, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOIVS. 101 chimney-piece, with its bits of Old English china, to the Turkish rugs and Moorish curtains. The low chairs, broad window-seats and wide couches in cosy corners ; the pictures, which were not Wardour-street knights and shepherdesses, but lovely bits oi landscape and genre painting, old and new, relieved by the white gleam of busts and statuettes. These were not huddled away and ensconced in corners, beyond the risk of accident. They were in nobody's way. There were sketches done last week or yesterday on the easel. There were what ap peared an infinite variety of charming vases \u2014 big and little, tawny7 yellow, blood-red, blue-green \u2014 fit receptacles for the choice spoils of the woods and the fields, as well as of the gardens and greenhouses. It was all so different from the Maisonette drawing room, which had its own purity and sweetness of re finement, and yet was so prim and pinched and charac teristic of a limited horizon. Miss West's tall crystal flower-glasses and dumpy Sevres vases in the not very good style of thirty or forty years ago, filled with never failing clusters of roses and sprays of clematis in the season, failed to redeem the whole. These were stiff, clumsy attempts to represent this wilderness of fragrance and delight. Mrs. Hobbs came into the room, with her spare, yet thick-set, commonplace figure, and her respectable, tidy dowdiness and scrimpness \u2014 the distinguishing attributes of the gowns and caps, which were of the best materials made by the best dressmakers and milliners. The spell was broken. Constance set her hostess down as look ing not a bit different from an upper servant ; yet the girl had to own that however much the mistres3 might seem out of keeping with her ideal drawing-room, she did not look lost or from home in it. She took it all for granted, and sat down in what was clearly her own chair, at her own table, though she did not bring forward her basket of work while she entertained her company. \" I'm glad as you've found us at home, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, addressing herself specially to Miss West, while she shook hands with her and Constance."], [114, "102 A MORNING MIST. ' ' Mattie and me were sorry to miss you when we called at your house.\" Miss West was an eminently truthful woman by nature, but she could do nothing save mumble an unin telligible regret on her side, and feel like a detected impostor in Constance's eyes and her own. \" Mattie will be here to speak to you presently,\" went on Mrs. Hobbs, with the utmost composure, as if there could be no question that the visitors had come over from Maisonette to be spoken to by Mattie Hobbs. ' ' She has been messing herself with some of them clay models she and Joe will make a muddle with, and as we are going over after lunch to this grand spread, or what ever you like to call it, as General Brabazon is giving to his tenants and friends at High Oaks on his son's coming of age, she thought she had best clean herself and dress right away. You will be going to High Oaks, too ? \" \" No,\" said Miss West, now speaking audibly and fluently, for she saw her chance of escape. \" We go nowhere,\" \" Don't you ? \" questioned Mrs. Hobbs in return, rather in friendly remonstrance than in awed ac quiescence. \"Ain't that bad for you, and hard on a young person like Miss Beauchamp here?\" \"I think it best,\" answered Miss West, freezingly, putting an end to the discussion, as she was quite able to do. It was time when Constance had heard herself termed a \" young person.\" The oddity of the circumstance tickled the girl. She was aw7are of it in the middle of her pre-occupation with the triumphs of wealth and taste - it might be a decorator's taste \u2014 in the rooms around her. She was also conscious that she was wondering how the dreadful woman's son, who was so much more like other people, felt at his mother's brutal denseness of mind aud directness of speech. She glanced at him from under the shade of her curling auburn eyelashes. He must have inherited his mother's invulnerability to social distinctions. He did not look covered with annoyance and mortification. He was occupied with the remarks"], [115, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOWS. 103 he was making to her, or rather the inquiries he was addressing to her. \" Are you fond of the country? Have you a prefer ance for Oxfordshire ? \" He put these simple questions as if they were of vital importance. He could be in earnest about something, it was clear, though he did not mind his mother's solicisms. Before Constance could make any further observations Mattie Hobbs came in. Ah ! She was in keeping with the surroundings. She fitted more into them even than her brother had done. She was a very handsome girl, giving evidence of a highly-endowed nature, thoroughly cultivated and rendered equal to any occasion. She might have been a queen worthy of the title, or she might have been a working-woman, when she would still have looked and felt like a queen of w7orking women. Even Constance's crippled, undeveloped per ceptions were sensible of this. Mattie Hobbs's warm, glowing beauty, her air of strength and suppleness, of joyous enterprise and courageous endurance, would have set off the accompaniments of a palace and been set off by them. Her very dress which she had put on for a great gathering \u2014 half-rural-feast, half garden-party\u2014 did not look too much of a gala dress or sit ill on her. It was a perfect dress, almost cheating Constance into believing that its dim maize colour, its soft, easily falling folds, its dainty devices of a close clasp or a loose tie, or a flower drooping carelessly from its place, caught and nestled in some zephyr-like entanglement, were of small value, and nearly a matter of chance when they must represent the height of a great modiste's art. And Mattie Hobbs wore the dress not only as if it were made for her, but as if it were part of her, so entirely a part that she had no thought to give to it after she had chosen it, put it on, and so done the best she could for it. \" Miss Beauchamp,\" said Mattie, with a merry glance of her dark eyes, \" I wonder if you remember me? \" \"I? No, I beg your pardon,\" stammered Constance, with all the astonishment which about this time began to fill her blue eyes, and to contend with the wistful"], [116, "104 A MORNING MIST. yearning which had long dwelt in their depths. \" I do not believe that I have ever seen you before, except in church. Of course I remember seeing you there, and yet I do not know what you do with yourself on Sunday mornings, for I do not often see you then,\" ended the girl, with a kind of frankness compelled from her. \" Oh, I don't belong to any particular sect,\" Mattie assured her. \" I am really one of Mr. Parry's flock, like yourself, but generally in the mornings I sit far forward with a set of girls who help the choir, or I sit with my Sunday-school class as far back as the other seat is forward. But I was speaking of Dinglemouth. Have you forgotten Dinglemouth where we were as children, and were continually passing each other on the sands, and where we had one special encounter? \" \" I know that we were at Dinglemouth while poor mamma was still alive, but I must confess \" Con stance began in a hesitating fashion, when Mattie inter rupted her. She was sorry that she had aroused a sad recollection. The girl's face did not look too cheerful to begin with. All that Mattie could do now was to hurry on with her reminiscences, and win Miss Beauchamp from her own sorrowful associations by engrossing her attention with those which were Mattie's. \"I see it is a case of the one moon and the many flowers. You were the first child\u2014 the kind of child I mean\u2014 that I had seen, and I took a violent fancy to you. I called you ' the little lady,' because till then I had only been acquainted with homely children like myself, for father was still a poor man then. Once I had the supreme honour and glory of rushing to you and trying to remedy the damage you had got from skipping into a pool. Your father saw us from an open window, spoke very kindly to me, and insisted on my having some fruit.\" \"Did he? That was like him,\" cried Constance, brightening to such a degree at the mention of her father and at the implied praise of him, that she was not like the same creature she had been the minute"], [117, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOWS. 105 before, to the admiration of Joe Hobbs. He was lean ing against the shutter at the opposite side of the broad window-seat on which Constance was seated, where Mattie had placed herself by her visitor's side. \" I wish I could recollect anything about it,\" said Constance, in tones of sincere regret. \" It sounds so stupid of me not to recollect, and as it was before Miss West came to us I cannot even appeal to her to prick my memory.\" \" Mattie will do that,\" said Joe, with the slight, almost imperceptible, stutter with which he was apt to speak when he was interested and pleased. \" Will you think it a great liberty on my part,\" asked Mattie, with her frank, fearless brightness, \"if I tell you that I have wished very much to see you near at hand, and find if you were what I imagined you, since I dis covered that the Miss Beauchamp at Maisonette was my Miss Beauchamp ? It is unheard-of presumption to say it, but you were mine in a sense ; my first ideal. What will you say when you hear that I bestowed your name, without getting your permission, on a large family of dolls, each of them endowed with what I supposed were your attractions ; what a travesty I must have made of you ! How little resemblance you bear to all my dozen or so of Constance Geraldine Beauchamps ! '' \" I daresay every one of them was a great deal better and prettier than I,\" declared Constance, with a gay laugh. Reserved and exclusive as she was in her habits and ideas, she had inevitably surrendered. She could not be insensible to the innocent flattery which had been practised where she was concerned. What girl w*ould not have been pleased to learn\u2014 after she had known herself lonely, with few or none to appreciate her, and hardly a kindred tie \u2014 that this other girl, who, whatever she had been at the date of her childish fancy, was now a woman radiant in her gifts and graces, had faithfully remembered and cherished the other's youthful image all these years? It was something to have had even a dozen of dolls named after her ! It so touched Constance that she was not offended by the brother's chiming in with the assertion : \" Don't"], [118, "106 A MORNING MIST. visit it upon the rest of us that your name has been a household word in the family. It was all the doing of my incorrigible sister there.\" \"Take care, Joe,\" Mattie defended herself, \"lest I turn the tables upon you. I fancy I have a faint re membrance of your having taken one of my Miss Beau champs \u2014 the most perfect and best beloved of them all \u2014 to give her a sail on a raft of your own construction on a duckpond when wre had country quarters in a farmhouse that summer. The result was that you capsized the raft, and escaped yourself with a ducking and a scold from father and mother, but you consigned Miss Beauchamp \u2014 my favourite Miss Beauchamp \u2014 to a watery grave.\" \" What a horrible omen ! Don't believe hei*. She is offering 'Queen's evidence,' which is mean, and never to be depended upon. It was a puppy of my own I had on the raft, and he swam ashore long before I could reach dry land.\" Constance looked from one to the other in bewilder ment. It was passing strange to her, while it was quite natural to the two others, that the idle, jesting talk should break the ice of their introduction, and leave them no longer strangers, but on such a friendly footing as Constance had never dreamt of occupying with the Hobbses. For that matter, she did not hold it with any other acquaintance. Mr. Hobbs seldom came into the drawing-room in the morning, but for some reason he walked in to-day. Mrs. Hobbs looked at her husband, and he looked at Constance from under his bushy eyebrows, still dark, while his hair was iron-grey. But it was to Miss West, as to the elder woman, that he turned, waiting to be named to her, bending his grand head and holding out a muscular hand first to her and then to Constance, who only saw in him a larger, more deliberate-looking, calmer, twice-as-old edition of his son. \" Father,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with unusual formality, \" Miss West here do tell me that her beast has lost a shoe and gone lame. Joe has sent him to the stables,"], [119, "MISADVENTURE AT KINGSMEADOIVS. 107 and one of them lads have ridden for Dale from the smithy. I have told Miss West it will be a work of time, so as she had better make' the best of it by having lunch with us. She says her and Miss Beauchamp has had lunch afore they started from home. They take it early, as we take it late when you are not in town, that you may have a long morning to see after the place. It stands to reason it is a stiff drive here and back for a one-horse machine. The air don't ought to take away the appetite, but the reverse ; and we'd be pleased if they would stay and take a bite with us.\" Old Joe bowed his head again. \" To be sure, ma'am, we shall be very glad if you'll stay.\" He supported his wife's invitation. \" You are very good,\" said poor Miss West, feeling that she was getting farther and farther into a labyrinth, \" but I could not think of such a thing. We could not eat a couple of luncheons, though you were so hospit- able as to propose it ; we are not hungry. We must not detain you from your meal. I think we might walk on before, if somebody would oblige me by giving orders for Thomas to follow us with the phaeton. He could easily overtake us before we had gone far.\" \" We could not allow that, Joe,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, looking at her husband and speaking as if the decision rested entirely with them ; \" we must see the ladies safely off in their phaeton, if Miss West don't agree to let us give them a lift in one of our machines. Maisont, or whatever Frenchified name you calls the cottage, ain't no distance out of our way to High Oaks. How- ever that may be,\" returningto the subject of the lunch, \" I knows a many folk are particular about breaking their fasts atween meals ; neither do I go with stuffing all day long \u2014 second breakfasts, such as Mattie was used to abroad ; a couple of teas, one afore and t'other after your dinner ; a young chicken and a bottle of claret or the like put into the dressing-room, in case a body felt peckish before stepping into bed. No, I ain't one of that sort ; I'd rather want than stuff. If you arn't hungry, Miss West, no more am I; I can have a bit of"], [120, "108 A MORNING MIST. bread-and-cheese, if so be I'm inclined, after you're gone. I'll sit with you, ladies, while my master and Mattie and Joe go to their meal.\" \"But that would be worse and worse,\" cried Miss West, with something like a groan, starting to her feet at the heinous breach of propriety thus coolly sug gested. \" By no manner of means,\" insisted Mrs. Hobbs. \" I ain't wanted to keep the children in order. They dine early with Miss Flockhart 'cept on Sundays.\" \" I cannot deprive you of your luncheon. You do not suppose that either Miss Beauchamp or I can consent to such an arrangement ? We'll rather go with you and do what we can,\" finished Miss West, in broken-down submission."], [121, "CHAPTER IX. BREAD AND SALT WITH THE SEASONING OP SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS. It seemed that Mr. Hobbs regarded luncheon like dinner, so solemnly did he offer his arm to Miss West \u2014 always treating age as venerable, though it was no greater than his own. Miss Beauchamp might be Sir Randal's daughter as well as Bessie Lane's, and she was certainly a more interesting person to him than a ci-devant governess or present chaperon could be. But Miss West was a woman come to mature years, which entitled her in his unbiassed judgment to take precedence of her pupil. The young lass might troop down with the other y*oung people, which was what, in fact, she did, while Mrs. Hobbs was in her own house, and, for once in her life, was in accord with social rules, since she liked to see everybody down before her. In any case, that would have been her choice. Mr. Hobbs placed Miss West at his right hand ; said grace, which a boiler-maker could do as fitly as a prince of the blood ; and attended carefully to the wants which his companion had repudiated. He did it, with the greater freedom from other cares, that the general carv ing \u2014 that old stumbling-block to a son of the people \u2014 was undertaken by the man at the sideboard. After Mr. Hobbs had seen that Miss West was looked after in the contents of her plates and glasses he acted as if no more were required of him. He set himself to eat his meal in Jove-like silence and steadiness. Luncheon, like dinner, was a meal to be eaten with relish if possible, as a duty still more than a pleasure if"], [122, "110 A MORNING MIST. relish failed. It was not a mere excuse for talk. Mr. Hobbs certainly did not dream of entertaining his guest mentally in such circumstances. Now, when Miss West had dined in company with Sir Randal Beauchamp she could not forget to this day what good company he had been. Perhaps be did not provide the finest specimen of a feast of reason and a flow of soul, still he was full of wit and gaiety, hard up as he was for the most part in his fortunes. He could give to airy nothings an irresistible attraction. His general culture was unmistakable. His unfailing anecdotes were unsurpassable in their grace and piquancy. Miss West put down Mr. Hobbs in her mental note- book as not merely clownish, but dull as ditchwater, in spite of his success in trade, which proved that Miss West, though a woman of considerable sense and intelli- gence, who had also arrived at the years of discretion, was not possessed of infallible judgment. Joe Hobbs senior was self-taught. Such book knowledge as he had, apart from what concerned mechanics, was largely superficial, and got at secondhand. He had spent his youth a working man among working men. He had begun to rise in the world tolerably early in life, so as to have his company soon sought after \u2014 first by managers and then by masters. He had contrived to read a good deal in his spare time, but it had not been general reading ; and so far as the mass of standard books and learning, in a conventional sense, were concerned, he could not master them. He had made good use of what he had acquired in a desultory fashion. He had travelled in later years, and formed his own deduction from what he saw with observant eyes. He would speak in vigorous if unpolished English, when he saw himself called upon to speak. He had thought more deeply than most men on the leading topics of the day and the signs of the times. He was recognized as an authority on some of them. To compare old Joe Hobbs's weighty talk, in season, to the late Sir Randal Beauchamp's elegant and brilliant skimming of the surface of conversation at all times, was as if one were"], [123, "BREAD AND SALT. 111 to liken the sparkling babble of a brook to the strong, still stream which is only heard, and that to purpose, when the tide is in and the flood is high. Miss West read in the county paper not long after wards that the best, the soundest, the most carefully considered speech on local taxation, at a meeting sum moned to attract public attention to the subject, was made by Joseph Hobbs, Esquire, of Kiugsmeadows. So much for the bare flattery that is given to wealth, Miss West made the disdainful comment to herself : \" The man cannot speak three sentences at his own table,\" which was all that she knew of the matter. Miss West had glanced up and down the table and pronounced it \" ridiculously overdone,\" the usual fault of rampantly rich parvenus. She honestly preferred her own meagre set-out and frugal fare. She would have been shocked if she could have believed that she had not inducted Miss Beauchamp into all the accom plishments and ceremonies included in living like a lady, from the use of table-napkins and finger-glasses, which were not common adjuncts in Miss West's youth, to the daily drive in fine weather, the pastime of archery, a little dainty carving where there was no man at the side board, the arrangement of a modest amount of flowers, and the dispensing of afternoon tea properly. But after all it was a somewhat skeleton version of high life, and Miss West was wrong ; there was nothing gorgeous about the Hobbses' table or luncheon. It was simply the meal and the table of wealthy people who had grown up, so far as meals and tables were concerned, to their wealth. Miss West had long been unaccustomed to wealth, while its present owners saw it right to use their riches. Lamb had already ceased to be a rarity of the season ; why, it was on cold lamb and salad, with a rice pudding for a sequel, that the ladies from Maisonette had lunched some time ago ; salmon had become equally allowable fare, even to people of moderate income. There were pigeons, but the supply of pigeons was also ample in the country ; sweetbreads did not cost an extravagant price when got from a family butcher. The lobster mayon-"], [124, "112 A MORNING MIST. naise was a little uncalled for, but it was possible that it might have been made of potted lobster. The pudding and tart did not look out of the way. The claret aud sherry might have been had at eighteenpence and two shillings a bottle. The fruit, certainly, was splendid. The hothouse grapes, early peaches, and nectarines would have been grossly extravagant, but it was well known there were large forcing-houses at Kingsmeadows. What were the Hobbses to do with the produce which they could not propose to sell at a profit, and could hardly dispense altogether among hospitals, if it did not appear at their table ? Doubtless they were oppressed by their superabundance of fruit. Happy people ! In the same way Joe Hobbs had found an orchid house among the other greenhouses, and he was of a mind to let nothing go down in his establishment, which afforded work, and developed skill and industry among the workers. In addition, as he turned his attention to the right cultivation of this and that growth, practically new to him, whether it was the growth of wheat and turnips or of vines and orchids, inevitably he became interested in the process and took pleasure in bringing it as near as possible to perfection. Therefore there were lovely orchids and stephanotis, oleander and plumbago, which Constance had read of but scarcely seen out of a flower show or the plates in a book on floriculture (though she could remember indistinctly the half-empty greenhouses at Fairfields), lending a delicate glory to the table. Yet they did not efface or intermeddle with the vase of honeysuckle and sweet peas which stood before Mrs. Hobbs, or the single insignificant lilac orchids which Mattie looked at and patted affectionately into its place in its little dragon-shaped holder, as if she \u2014 who had found it on a neighbouring common, and brought it home as her own peculiar spoil \u2014 continued to value it among its grand relations. The same motive ran through the whole details to those who could read them. When Joe Hobbs com pleted the furnishing of Kingsnaeadows, he naturally bought things which would last, some of which could be"], [125, "BREAD AND SALT. 113 handed down to young Joe, therefore the amount of silver in epergne and corner-dishes, &c, &c, which helped to bestow a costly air on the table. Then there were specialities due to individual weaknesses, which the Hobbses as a family could afford to gratify, and did not see themselves called on to deny. Mrs. Hobbs, though a plain woman, had a passion for fine table-linen, and did not starve the passion. Young Joe had a penchant for fine glass, ancient, and modern Venetian, Dutch, and native, and indulged it. Mattie's mania was for china, and the dessert service worthy of Wedgwood was the re sult. Only old Joe in his Jove-like outlook was superior to such trifling. The effect was dazzling to Constance, accustomed to those meritorious performances of Miss West's, which constituted, as it were, periodical rehearsals in plain materials of this impressive spectacle. But what was still more impressive, even startling, was the unaccountable fact that Miss Hobbs and her brother, who looked a lady and gentleman, should sit and easily eat, drink, and talk without betraying the smallest discomfiture at the incon gruous figures of their father and mother at the two ends of the table. In all the books Constance had read, which described such trying family discrepancies, the children either ignored or were mortally ashamed of their homely parents. But the two Hobbses junior not only appealed and referred to their father and mother with the greatest simplicity and readiness, there was evidence of even more than usual confidence and affection in the family relations, to judge by unstudied, im promptu looks and tones. Had the world advanced another stage ? Were cultured young people so wise and exalted in mind that they were above being affronted by their uncultured progenitors ? Or was there some thing so great and overbalancing in the minds of these progenitors that their progeny could afford to have the authors of their being diamonds in the rough, displaying their roughness to critical eyes ? Was there a retro grading, disintegrating process beginning in society ? Constance felt that she could not have behaved as the 8"], [126, "114 A MORNING MIST. young Hobbses did. She would have winced keenly, and been reduced to misery if her mother, while she ate her food like a civilized being, had still planted her brown hands on the table before her, as Mrs. Hobbs several times planted hers ; and if her father had drunk beer instead of wine, holding up his glass and looking through his beer as if he were in a tavern, and leaning back in his chair in a manner which would have been barely permissible in the solitude of his study, or after the ladies had left the dining-room. Happily for themselves and for all, Miss Hobbs and Mr. Joe did not look as if they minded the parental eccentricities in the least. They appropriated Constance very much as if she were their property, either because of her connection with the dolls of past days, or from an esprit de corps common to young people with which she was till then unacquainted. They plied her with friendly attentions and pleasant sallies. When Mattie was offering her visitor a peach she stopped to remind her laughingly: \"The last time we really met, Miss Beauchamp, your father emptied the contents of a dish of plums and grapes into my lap. Oh, they tasted so good, I have not forgotten their flavour to this day 1 \" And again Constance's still face brightened all over, and her heart warmed to the speaker. When the brother and sister fancied they were weary ing and bewildering their visitor they turned to each other with lively challenges and cutting rejoinders \u2014 so desperately cutting that if it had not been for the faces and voices with which they were delivered, one might have imagined that they came from deadly foes instead of fast friends. \" Well, Joe, did your swan bring home the whole of his wages to his wife last Saturday night? Is he qualified to address a Temperance meeting? Will he make a first-rate groom without more ado? I hope, I do hope, he will not lame ' Catinka,' or damage the carriage horses, which father will not like. Let us trust that he will confine his misdeeds to ' Magpie ' and the rest of his patron's stud,\" declared Mattie."], [127, "BREAD AND SALT. 115 \" I should say my swan's conduct was much on a par with that of your swan's\u2014 your last batch of Friendly Girls. Don't they all make a point of running away from their first places ? \" \"Oh, Joe ! poor little girls of twelve or thirteen; with drudging, untrained mothers, who, I am sorry to say, teach their daughters little save gossiping and slattern liness,\" said Mattie, reproachfully. \" Oh, Mattie ! I know a y*oung fellow who was work house born and bred, whose father was a tramp, who never knew his mother, who has had the misfortune to marry a little goose of a wife who cannot cook a morsel of wholesome food, and can only sit down w7ith her baby in her lap in the middle of her dirty dwelling, and whimper when everything goes wrong with the precious pair.\" \" Poor things ! I am sorry for them,\" cried Mattie, relentingly. \" But why did you propose to turn one of these geese into a full-fledged swan ? '' \" And why will you elevate your smutty-faced scullery maids and towsled-headed nursery-girls into civilised angels? \" \" I don't do anything so foolish.\" \" Then your words sometimes belie you.\" At last Miss West got away, and found herself with her charge in the safe privacy of their phaeton, though she had a despairing consciousness that, after having been betrayed into the pronounced step of lunching with the taciturn boiler-maker and his family it would not be so easy as she had calculated to let the acquaintance which had been thrust upon her die the speedy, graceful, natural death she had destined for it. The two ladies looked at each other. Constance laughed merrily, Miss West smiled faintly. \" I do not know what else we could have done,\" she commenced to say, in carefully lowered tones; \"I almost think it would have been better if we had done as you suggested and taken no notice of those cards.

We could not afford to entertain them in the foolish style in which they are accustomed to live, and I am not sure that your brother would like vou to associate with them.\" \"I don't think that it can signify much to John in India, where he seems to mean to spend the rest of his days. He has been out there ever since I can remember, and he has twice exchanged into regiments replacing those which were coming home,\" said Constance, with a strain of vexation in her voice. \" Do you know, Miss West '' (Constance would no more have dreamt, even as a child, of addressing Miss West as \" Westie,\" in modern fashion, than she would have thought of calling her mother, if she had been alive, by her Christian name), \" although it was not at all what we intended, I am not sure whether the adventure was not great fun, and I admit I rather liked it for a change ? \" \"I daresay you did,\" said Miss West, drily ; \"what did you think of it all \u2014 the house and everything ? \" \" It was beautiful,\" said Constance, with a long drawn sigh, \" more beautiful than I could have imagined ; and not at all vulgar, as I expected. Miss Hobbs was splendid, such a fine-looking girl, and so kind when she spoke of poor Papa. She struck me as a lady every inch of her.\" \"She looked it,\" owmed Miss West, candidly. \"The young people are well enough, and may pass muster anywhere. Schools and colleges have done wonders for them. I daresay the polish does not go very deep, still it is enough for the ordinary intercourse of society.\" \" I did not care so much for the brother,\" volunteered Constance; \" he frowns so, even when he is smiling, and is so dreadfully in earnest about nothing at all \u2014 about a new groom he appears to have introduced into their stables. He reminded me a little of the foreigners among whom we lived when I was a child. He looked as if he could not be altogether quiet and calm for five minutes, to save his life. Do you understand what I mean ? I used to be troubled by the notion that those"], [129, "BREAD AND SALT. 117 French and Italians were like monkeys, and I never cared for monkeys as some children care for them.\" Miss West considered this was going too far. \" The Rector says this young Hobbs is clever in his father's line, and a nice young fellow besides,\" she said, reprov ingly. \" Oh, the father is not at all like a monkey,\" went on Constance, full of her own idea, \" though I could easily have recognised the two as father and son. I do not know where .to find a comparison for the old man : he bears no resemblance to his own butler, or to a farmer.\" \"My dear,\" interposed Miss West, a little shocked, \u2022\"he is not old ; and why should he resemble a butler or a farmer ? He is the next thing to a millionaire \u2014 all by his own doing \u2014 so that I suppose he must be a clever business man, though he is a tiresome companion at table.\" \"I saw that you could not get on with him,\" said Constance, with a nod, \" though I know you would say all that was necessary to get him to speak. I believe what made me think of a butler in connection with him is, that his wife is so like a respectable working house keeper, or what I should think the matron of some public institution would be. She is not sufficiently full-blown for a cook, and she is not nearly stylish enough for a superannuated waiting-maid. She is dreadful all the same. Her dialect is not nearly so good as that of a well-to-do shopwoman or the landlady of a thriving country inn, or the wife of the farmer whom Mr. Hobbs does not resemble. She was so different from her sur roundings, yet nobody seemed to mind. It was all so comically topsy-turvy ; and everybody's coolness was quite incredible. Her family are used to her, of course.\" \" You are right. She is a little dreadful \u2014 a grown up enfant terrible, as a child of nature, transplanted from one rank into another, is apt to be. But upon the whole I liked her as well as any member of the family,\" declared Miss West, magnanimously. \" She is not a iool, she has no false pretensions, she is illiterate and rustic to the backbone ; but I question whether I should"], [130, "118 A MORNING MIST. call her vulgar \u2014 at least, she is not half so vulgar as she might have been, and surely that is a merit. You need never be frightened for hearing that woman mis apply words with whose true meaning she is not familiar, or drop into false quotations. She will not un derstand you, but she will not affect to understand. She is narrow and prejudiced, no doubt, like all ignorant people, but she is thoroughly genuine.\" \" You don't mean to say you like Mrs. Hobbs better than her daughter, who is so handsome and ladylike ? '* cried Constance, opening great eyes more full of wonder than ever. \"Do you know, she says she is always so busy ? ' ' The speaker gave another sigh, a quick one this time, drawn from a vague, dissatisfied perception that her own life was one long languor. \" She says she never knows what to attend to first ; she cannot tell how or why girls in the country find less to do than girls in town \u2014 to which, by-the-by, the Hobbses don't mean to go for any part of the Season. Her father takes her up to see any sight she cares for, such as the spring pictures; and her brother keeps her au fait to the good plays and operas, and goes with her to hear them if he thinks them worth the journey. But Mr. Hobbs is under the impression that a girl is no better for driving and riding in the Park, like a prisoner taking exercise, every morning. I suppose she would be sure to be in vited everywhere, because they are so rich, and she can dress, and dance, and talk, and look ten times as hand some as most girls. Is it not marvellous with such a mother, and a father no better than a boiler-maker ? \" \"Our generation \u2014 yours, I should say \u2014 is an example of the apparent triumph of the plutocracy,\" said Miss West, sententiously. \" I said ' apparent ' advisedly. I never heard ' the season ' treated so unceremoniously as your friend of a day seems to have disposed of it.\" \" She is reading with the Masons \u2014 Dr. Mason's daughters \u2014 at Rivermeadows, to help them to pass the Cambridge Examination.

She has one of Mr. Parry's largest dis tricts, as he told us, you remember. She belongs to ever so many clubs and societies, and at every spare moment she has to get hold of her brother to play lawn tennis with her. She has some old school-friends coming to visit her next week, who are great tennis players. She does not wish to sink below contempt in their eyes, or to deprive them of foemen worthy of their steel, which she will do if she and her brother do not touch a racket in the meantime.\" \" She is too advanced a young lady for my taste,\" said Miss West, coldly. \" When I was a young woman girls of position had their own pursuits and accomplishments, their separate and individual lives to lead \u2014 the less before the world the better ; and they found they had quite enough to do to show themselves the perfect gentlewomen they were bound to be. But now nothing will do for them except coming forward and performing as servants of the public. They are as much emanci pated as their brothers are. I caught the fag-end of what Miss Hobbs was saying to you; and I could not resist asking her mother, as a woman of ripe years and common sense, though she is not a lady, what she thought of the new attitude which girls adopted nowa days. I had forgotten that girls in the class the mother belonged to never had much guidance, and were always considered to suffice for themselves as soon as they grew up. So, naturally, she said, ' Every generation had its new*-fangled ways. Martha was of age and could speak for herself.' I declare she reminded me of the Jewish parents in the Scriptures, who threw all the responsi bility on their blind son. Then she added that ' Martha was a good girl,' as if I ever doubted it, or would have brought you into her company, if I had entertained such a doubt. She might be a little taken with these modern fads of putting her finger into other people's pies, under the impression that she, a girl, could bake them better than those they belonged to. But she made herself of use at home to her father and mother and brother aud the younger children.\""], [132, "120 A MORNING MIST. \" If she makes herself of use she makes other people of use also,\" said Constance, laughing. \" She was con stantly saying, in reference to any difficulty, ' I'll get Joe to do it ; ' 'I'll make Joe set that right.' And how the two contradicted and laughed at each other ! Is that chaffing, Miss West ? \" \"I suppose it is,\" said Miss West, warily. \" Chaffing is not a very elegant expression, neither is it a practice with which I have had much to do. I should say it is a good deal confined to young men in barracks, Bohemian authors, and comedians, who seem never to tire of practical jokes and horse-play, which must be shop to the last. Excuse the slang, dear ; you see how evil com munications corrupt good manners. As for Miss Hobbs talking of making her brother do this or that, of course a gentleman should serve a lady, but -what becomes of the gallantry and grace of the service when it is extorted in that domineering, dictatorial style ? Apart from that a free-and-easy, give-and-take mode of speech and behaviour does not recommend itself to me, as it is met with between young men and women even when they are brothers and sisters. If such manners are to prevail what will become of the old feminine graces and attrac tions? \" \"I don't know,\" replied Constance, absently. \" Perhaps it was a little rude, but it did sound very friendly and merry.\" At Kingsmeadows, which these critics had left behind with little intention of ever seeing the place or the people again, save from a respectful distance, there were counter-remarks ; but these were fewer and more cursory, because the Hobbses were busy people, as they had represented themselves. \"Is the girl like her mother, Joe?\" Mrs. Hobbs asked her husband when the pair strolled a little way together on the road to the home farm. \" Not much,\" answered old Joe, in his quiet, matter-of fact manner. \" She has the same hair and colour, but they were Sir Randal's as well as Bessie's.

' \" Mrs. Hobbs did not say any more to her husband, but when she rejoined Mattie \u2014 who was tolerating Joe's cigar ostensibly because it did the plants good \u2014 in one of the conservatories, she said, plainly: \" She is a proud, stuck-up piece of goods, that there young Miss Beau champ ; see if you don't find her so, Mattie.\" \" I think it is as much shyness as pride,\" said Mattie, reflectively; \"but to think that the wilful, dressed-up little fairy, who would have her own way \u2014 even to the soaking of her slippers on Dinglemouth sands \u2014 should have grown up into this demure puss in the next thing to a Quaker costume ! \" \" She'd let you wipe her shoes for her again,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, grimly ; \" and count you paid back by the honour of doing it.

In the course of the next day or two a letter arrived at Maisonette, which entirely changed the current of the ladies' ideas, and threw their inadvertent visit to Kings meadows completely into the background. The letter was to Miss West, and was from Sir John Beauchamp. It was not his usual time of writing with the customary small cheque, so that the mere appearance of the letter created a sensation which was confirmed by the contents. Sir John was at last on his way home. Even his constitution had not stood without injury a long course of various unhealthy districts in India. He had been on the sick list ; he was ordered \u2014 not to Simla, but to England. He proposed to spend part of his leave at Maisonette, if Miss West could receive him ; and he should arrive by the next mail, which, as the present mail had been late, meant almost immediately. What excitement that short formal letter aroused ! How the maiden tranquillity of Maisonette was upset. What a fever of expectation and anxiety thrilled not only the youthful heart of Constance, but the much more ex perienced and mature bosom of Miss West ! The unseen brother was to arrive at last, and make the acquaintance of his unknown sister, whom he had shyly ignored up to this moment ; for why should he write and announce his return to Miss West, and ask if she could receive him (though that, of course, was simply a form) and not communicate with his own flesh and blood ? What was he to Miss West compared with what he was to his"], [136, "124 A MORNING MIST. sister? Constance felt old enough to be treated as a friend and equal. She was not so mean and captious as to grudge Miss West's taking precedence of her, but surely John, Constance's own brother, might have written a note to her, might have sent her a message. Her heart swelled with puzzled pain, as it had swelled many a time since she was a little girl, at the omission of all save the most perfunctory mention of her \u2014 a brief hope that Constance was well \u2014 a dry request to be re membered to her. What a difference it made, to be sure, where brothers and sisters were brought up to gether ! What close companions and intimate friends Miss Hobbs and her brother seemed to be ! But perhaps that had been an easier matter in their station than it was in Constance's. If gentle birth and rank have their privileges, it may be but just that humble birth and inferior rank shall have some advantages which they can call their own in turn. To Miss West the long-delayed return of Sir John was the arrival of the head of the house, the representa tive of the late Sir Randal. He was taking the first step to acknowlegding his sister \u2014 in another way than by contributing to her support. What would he think of Constance? Everything would depend upon that. It was a most momentous meeting for the poor child, if she only guessed it. It was surely a good sign that ne was repairing first to Maisonette before going to his mother's relations who had brought him up, who were likely enough to get hold of him and seek to prejudice him against his half-sister. Miss West was not well ac quainted with these people ; she had understood they had been very bitter, not without reason, against Sir Randal and the second Lady Beauchamp. They had never taken the slightest notice of her, or suffered her stepson, while he was under their care, to recognise her as his father's wife. Miss West was aware, so far, that there had been changes among these justly indignant people ; that the old Squire, Mr. x\\shley, of Newton Grange, Sir John's grandfather, was dead in the course of years ; and that his death had in a measure altered"], [137, "SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP. 125 the position of affairs where his grandson was concerned. Sir John, then Mr. Beauchamp, and not much more than of age, had broken away from his maternal rela tions, and had held no intercourse with his father while Lady Beauchamp was on her deathbed, beyond receiving any concession he might have made to her claims. It was at that time, just before leaving for India with his regiment, he had, in company with the next heir, agreed to the breaking of the entail, which had relieved Sir Randal for a season. This was the occasion on which Miss West had met Sir John. She believed that he could have no recollection of her, and all that her memory retained of him was the shadowy figure of a lad, the reverse of his father, w*ith whom he was far from being at ease, a slight, pale, notably silent lad \u2014 whether his silence was to be accounted for from his shrinking from the trying strangeness of the contact, or from natural character. For Miss West had heard that the first Lady Beauchamp had been ever before her mis fortunes a quick, forward woman, and that any attrac tion beyond accidental contiguity which had ever existed between her and Sir Randal had been the attraction of reverses. The husband and wife were like fire and water, with the usual results from such a union. It was at once Miss West's duty, and interest, and the policy bred of her affection for Constance Beau champ, to propitiate Sir John, to make everybody and everything at Maisonette appear at their very best for him, to render his stay with them as agreeable as she could make it. Influenced by these considerations, Miss West was even more engrossed and agitated by the prospect of their guest than Constance was, and her preparations were of so extensive and sweeping a nature, that the girl at last demurred and showed some thing like resentment. \" Give up your comfortable room, Miss West, and turn me out of the dressing-room, taking that poky west room with a cupboard of a dressing-room, putting me into the cupboard : or, what is a great deal worse, proposing to sleep in it instead of me, if I will consent to that preposterous arrangement ?"], [138, "126 A MORNING MIST. I cannot think why you should do that ; I am sure John will not like it, at least, he ought not. Why is he to turn the whole house upside down after he has been so long in coming back? Other people's relations don't go and stay ten or a dozen years in India without a break nowadays, until they get out of acquaintance with their kindred at home, even when they happened to know each other beforehand. I thought bachelors' rooms were always the worst in the house. I heard Miss Hobbs calling her brother's room his den, which did not sound promising.\" \"That is a very different thing,\" said Miss West, promptly. \" Miss Beauchamp is not going to take her cue from Miss Hobbs, surely ! You do not suggest that we should put up Sir John Beauchamp in quar ters that would be fitting enough for a Joe Hobbs ! \" \" No,\" said Constance, knitting her smooth, white brows. \" Of course, there is a great disparity, though it does not he chiefly in the fact of my brother being a baronet and an officer, and young Mr. Hobbs a boiler maker. That is like the vulgar outcry over ' a real live lord ' \" \u2014 she broke off with a little laughing, scornful protest; \"but I have heard you yourself say over and over again that a gentleman should always give place to a lady, that no gentleman would ever dream of doing anything else. Why are you so inconsistent ? \u2014 I beg your pardon for making such an accusation \u2014 but why should we be turned out of our very rooms and squeezed into holes and corners ; at your age, with your head aches, too ; that John should revel in every luxury ? I hope he would be very angry if he knew. I do hope so, Miss West. I hope, for his own sake, that he would never consent to such a reversal of what ought to be.\" \" You don't understand,\" said Miss West, with a little impatience. \" As to Sir John's revelling in luxury, we shall have the greatest difficulty in making him barely comfortable, living in the quiet, simple way we do, my love.\" A half-dozen additional lines of care were planted on the moment, by the thought, on Miss West's always fined brow. \" Gentlemen with their"], [139, "SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP. 127 clubs and mess-dinners are accustomed to everything so different from what satisfies ladies \u2014from what used to satisfy them, I ought to say, for I believe all the old, modest, economical ways of doing are dying out : life is getting such a self-indulgent, expensive affair among both gentle and simple.\" \" Especially among the simple,\" said Constance, with smiling emphasis, \" and you have just said they ought not to set an example to the gentle \u2014 noblesse oblige, eh ! With regard to gentlemen, particularly, I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves, if they cannot get on without being pampered. (Please, Miss West, don't keep on hemming that curtain frill !) My idea of a gen tleman is a man who is brave, and hardy, and simple, in another sense from that in which one expects such quali ties in a man of the people. My gentleman should be above for ever minding what he is to eat and drink, and what he is to wear ; how he is to sit and lie down.\" \" You don't know what you are speaking about,\" said Miss West, waxing a little fretful under her un shared burden. \" You are talking like a romantic baby whose head is full of Sir Galahads and Vikings and Roman citizens. Modern men are not like that.\" \" It is a pity they are not, murmured Constance, showing that she had latent spirits, and could be pro voking as well as dreamy. \"I think it is the novelty of John's being the very first relation who has sought us out since we came to Maisonette (how many years ago !) which has upset me,\" Constance resumed, a little penitently. \" Oh 1 there was our cousin, but she was only a middle-aged lady, and did not stay a week, and even that great event happened years ago. It is odd that I have not relations like other girls.\" \"How can you say that,\" interposed Miss West, hastily, \"when you have a brother like Sir John, and he is taking the first opportunity after his return to England of coming here to see you ? \" \"To see you,'' corrected Constance, with a shade of displeasure in her tone. \"It is always you with whom"], [140, "128 A MORNING MIST. he has to do, and the opportunity has been long in coming. How can he help himself when he comes back '? He must come to see me, I suppose. I am the nearest relation he has in the w7orld, as he is my nearest rela tion. The funny thing \u2014 not that it is at all funny in one sense,\" broke off the girl with a quivering voice ; \" but it is odd that we have never seen each other. It is horrid, Miss West,\" cried Constance, with sudden vexation ; \" I shall not know a bit how to look and act when he arrives. I suppose, as he is one of your modern men, he will quite know how to behave himself. That is some relief, for it is positively dreadful to be introduced for the first time to a grown-up brother\u2014 and I a big girl. I never can see altogether how such a queer state of matters came about, though he is only my half-brother, and was brought up by his own mother's relations. Besides, you have told me that the only time you can remember his coming to see papa, when poor mamma was so ill, I was just recovering from measles, and was confined to the nursery \u2014 to which he did not choose to penetrate.\" \"My dear Conny,\" remonstrated Miss West, \"what is the use of your raking up past difficulties and griev ances just now ? A young man is not like a girl. If your father had not been an only child, of course you and your brother would have had uncles and aunts and cousins in common, and I presume you would have met each other at some of their houses even if he had not been suffered to come to Fairfields. You are aware \u2014 at least I have certainly told you \u2014 that the relations of the first Lady Beauchamp were offended by your father's second marriage to your mother. Such second marriages are often the occasions of divisions in families,\" ended Miss West, with sententious brevity. \" It is wicked to let them be so,\" said Constance, in composed, almost solemn, youthful rectitude. \"I am sure poor mamma never did anything to hurt them. By-the-by, I do wish she had left kindred behind her, and then I might have had them to counterbalance John and his relations.\" \" Don't be childish, Constance,\" cried poor Miss West,."], [141, "SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP. 129 worried out of her usual calm dignity. \" Do hold your tongue, and go and make yourself useful. Get Thomas to cut you some flowers, if you cannot gather them for y7ourself, and arrange them for the table. That is in the province of the young lady of the house.\" \" I am afraid I have got all the conceit taken out of me with regard to flowers,\" said Constance, shaking her head, \"after what we saw at Kingsmeadows. Our flowers look so common and tame and washed out. I cannot rival the others, and if I did mine would only look absurd. Mean and dull, not graceful and splendid. Then there is nothing to put them in. I am so tired of the old stiff trio of glasses, and we have not a single thoroughly satisfactory vase or pot. I was looking them over yesterday, and came to that doleful conclusion.\" \" Nonsense,\" said Miss West, in a still more aggrieved voice. \" The flowers at Kingsmeadows were simply overpowering like everything else. I thought you would have had the good taste to see that. I always think a garden flower, like a wild flower, is so much fresher and sweeter than those over-forced greenhouse flowers. But nothing is prized in this generation except what has cost a great deal and is out of place and season. It is thoroughly meretricious, and positively vulgar. What ails the clusters of glasses, and how can a rose look more beautiful, or smell more sweetly, just because it is stuck in some foolish device of stoneware or brass? The idea of flowers growing in metal pots,\" exclaimed Miss West, sardonically. \" Why, when I was young, brass was not good enough for candlesticks ! \" \"But all that is changed,\" declared Constance, sedately. \" You cannot read an \u00e6sthetic novel without finding it out. And, unfortunately, the question is not of roses,\" and she glanced disparagingly at the big bunch of flowers which Thomas had sent in by the parlour-maid. \" Our early summer roses are over, and the second blow has not begun. I have to deal with the first dahlias and asters, marigolds, stocks, summer chrysanthemums,\" taking up one flower after another and looking at it very seriously; \" these are much more 9"], [142, "130 A MORNING MIST. difficult to group. Indeed, if it were not for mignonette, clematis, and nasturtiums, I should be driven to despair. The triplets of glasses and the Sevres vases, which are such bad shapes that I think the man who designed them ought to have been not hanged but guillotined \u2014 for I conclude he was a Frenchman \u2014 are not suited for large round-headed flowers. A little change would be agree able,\" urged Constance. \"I don't wish for anything expensive, of course. Something in Doulton or Valerie ware, or even in terra-cotta, which would cost just next to nothing at all, would do, if the shapes were good. Sha'n't we have it the next time we go to Dorrington? \" she finished, lifting up her delicate, flower-like face with irresistible coaxing. \" We'll see,\" said Miss West, making a compromise; \u25a0\" but, in the meantime, you must do with what you have, and be quick about it, Conny, for I have got out of the way of calculating the arrivals of mails and trains. I am in dread lest Sir John should take us by surprise after all, in spite of his intimation of his arrival.\" \"He must take us as he finds us,\" persisted Con stance, still nourishing a certain amount of rebellious stubbornness as she went off with her flowers. Miss West was left to say to herself : \" Poor child ! she has so little suspicion of how much consequence the effect she produces on her brother may be. Doulton ware or terra-cotta ! There is a good deal more at stake than that. He must see what a little beauty she is, and what a perfect lady she has been brought up. She is ready to like him, though the situation is excessively awkward; and she is beginning to feel puzzled and nettled, naturally. I am sure she has thought and spoken enough about him, even before there was this talk of his coming home, and wondered why they did not write to each other, and were not like other brothers and sisters, until I have hardly known how to continue to put her off. I trust, with all my heart, for the sake of Conny, poor innocent darling, the best beloved of my pupils, that Sir John has some heart, some family affection. She is all the family he has to"], [143, "SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP. 131 spend it upon, since he shook himself free from the con trol of his mother's relations, though the pair might not know each other if they met unawares. Dear, dear, how sadly trying it all is ! Some of poor Sir Randal's lavish generosity, without his errors and weaknesses, would not be amiss in his son. I understand from Nash, the old family lawyer, that the present baronet's charac ter and conduct have been irreproachable. I hope that does not mean that he has the hardness and narrowness of a Pharisee. I have heard these were considered the distinctive qualities of his mother's family. But he has broken away from them, and he is coming to us first \u2014 that is surely an excellent sign, if we can nlease his majesty.\" For Miss West could be ironical in the circumstances. It was a small gratification to Constance, as heralding the change for which she was ignorantly pining, that the bustle of the preparations for Sir John interrupted the daily unbroken routine, so dear to the old, so irksome to the young, woman. At least, Constance could not be expected to read so many pages of French and Italian, with no possibility of talking them over with Miss West, when Sir John was on his way to Maisonette \u2014 well-nigh at the door. Miss West was more restless and unsettled than Constance, though her sense of duty was so much stronger. Constance had always been impressed by Dante's circles, and enlivened by Madame de Se>igne's wit and tenderness. If she had not been compelled to take them in a succession of small regular doses, swal lowing one at a time, every twenty-four hours, she would have taken kindly to the man who had been in hell, and the woman who was so sweet and natural in the middle of her worldliness and courtliness. Constance would not have been outdone by any other impression able young girl far removed in time and place from the fiery, heroic Italian, and the lovable grande dame of the Louvre and Les Rochers. As for Constance's half-hours of scales aud \" exer cises,\" who could expect a girl to play scales and rehearse exercises, or even to con a single sheet of music, when"], [144, "132 A MORNING MIST. she was starting up from the piano at every step on the gravel or ring at the bell \u2014 even knock at the kitchen door, as if the unknown grown-up brother, always grown up to her, might elect to enter the house by the back regions ? As Miss West had anticipated and as often happens in cases of long waiting, Sir John took the ladies by surprise eventually ; and whether it was by accident or design everybody agreed, on second thought, that it was best so. First, he was shown in upon Miss West in the drawing-room, as she was about to bid Jane strike the gong in order to summon Constance, wandering some where in \"the grounds,\" to make afternoon tea. Miss West was almost too flurried to take stock of Sir John, beyond a few general particulars. He was tallr broad-shouldered, and too brown to look delicate. He had the Beauchamp complexion, but in other respects he was not at all like either the late Sir Randal, or Con stance. He had walked from the station, leaving his luggage to follow, which was another assurance that he had profited by his voyage, and had ceased to be an invalid. He had lunched. He did not wish to be shown to his room. Yes, he would be glad to see his sister, and as he was not tired, he would prefer to go with Miss West and look for her, rather than have her sent for to meet him. Miss West felt, instinctively, by the time she had arrived at this point in the conversation, that she had probably drawn as much from her impassive, soldierly looking visitor as any force, short of wild horses, would have extracted from him. Constance was not far off. She might really have seen from the French window, out of which Miss West and Sir John stepped, without any further conversation, for Miss West's tongue was beginning to cleave to the roof of her mouth, and her partner in the difficulty did nothing to break the ice. Constance was standing at the corner of the lawn, under a tulip-tree, close to the rustic fence which divided it from the paddock, and opposite the target, with its"], [145, "SIR JOHN BEAUCHAMP. 133 \"black and white rings. She was leaning with one arm across the fence aud staring at the target. She was not \u25a0an enthusiastic follower of Diana. She had been en tirely without the stimulus of competition, unless of the very mildest description, when Miss West, in spite \u25a0of a rheumatic shoulder and failing sight, literally drew .a bow at a venture. However exciting, not to say dis tressing, it might be to strike \" the flying hart,\" Con stance did not feel enough interest in merely hitting within one of the outer rings, or on rare occasions reaching the bull's-eye, to fill her with self-absorbed devotion where the sport was concerned. Yet at that moment she was thinking of nothing wiser or of more moment than of what an incorrect eye and unsteady hand she had, to be so seldom able to come out a lonely victor in the contest between herself and the target, for it was on very exceptional occasions, of which Con stance had to make much, that Miss West brought her stiffened muscles and spectacled eyes into action. The footsteps on the grass behind Constance made little or no sound, till Miss West, with Sir John by her side, was close at hand. Then the girl's quick ear caught the rustle of the grass. She started nervously, and faced round on the intruders on her maiden meditations. The colour flamed all over her face, then faded and left it very pale, and she looked for a second as if she would either have fainted or run away. It was only for a second that she threatened to disgrace Miss West's training, the next she advanced without either laughing or crying, held out her hand and said with her pretty reflection of Miss West's stately, reserved air: \"I beg your pardon, I did not know you were come.\" \"How do you do, Constance ?\" he said, taking her hand. He made another slight forward movement, and then checked himself. Narrowly as Miss West was watching him, she could not tell whether he had felt an impulse to kiss his sister, or whether his foot had slipped on the dry grass."], [146, "CHAPTER XI. BROTHER AND SISTER. There was a faint smile on Sir John's moustached lips, but that did not go for much either way. \" How are you, John? \" Constance was saying with a timid earnestness, like a lesson she had been privately learning and was anxious to deliver correctly and get done with ; \" I hope you are well now.\" \" Thanks ; fairly well,\" he answered quickly, as if the subject of himself and his ailments was of all others the least likely to dispel his taciturnity and thaw his reserve. The next moment he turned to Miss West. \"Yes,\"' he said, \" the weather is very dry; I am afraid the root crops must be suffering.\" He spoke as if he were resuming a conversation which had really only been held in his imagination. Yet even the most ignorant of his audience was so convinced that he, too, was a victim to his unfamiliarity with his own flesh and blood, that his unwarrantable speech did not sound odd. Miss West, as the oldest person present, the ostensible hostess at Maisonette, long accustomed to the chief responsibility, felt called upon to effect a diversion at this stage of the interview. Clearly Sir John could no more make his way by a frank, graceless face ; a few light and airy touches from a tongue which assumed nothing and denied nothing ; an impulsive fleeting warmth alike of regret and anticipation ; such as con stituted the ease and charm with which the late Sir Randal had been wont to rid himself of the results of his follies, than he could have been the reckless originator of these follies. \" Go in, dear, and ring for fresh tea,\" Miss"], [147, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 135 West addressed Constance ; and then suavely included the visitor in the address : \" If Sir John here will not suffer us to put ourselves about in trying to find anything else to refresh him after his walk, he will, perhaps, let us supply him with that very womanly beverage \u2014 a cup of tea.\" Sir John muttered an acquiescent monosyllable, and Constance hurried away, with one long, earnest, parting glance at her brother. The inheritance of the Beau champs' Tudor complexion on the part of Sir John showed itself in his chestnut hair and beard. The hair, though cut close, displayed the uncontrollable tendency to curl which is often found with hair of the colour, and helped to lend a sculptured look to the head. The fair, florid complexion was sufficiently bronzed to remove the faintest suspicion of effeminacy from the well cut features. Figure and face were soldierly and exceptionally handsome, if a little stiff and cold, like the effigy of a man on guard. This effect was increased by the drooping eyelids, which largely concealed the eyes, in colour not such a light or dark hazel as might have been expected from the complexion, but a deep, sober grey. Constance was at once struck and favourably im pressed by her brother's looks and carriage. She did not believe she had ever seen so handsome a young man, with so distinguished an air. A complete revolution took place in her mind. She was full of pride and satis faction. Sir John was the first Ferdinand who had set foot on the maiden island, and he was valued accord ingly. In place of grudging him anything, the best of every thing was not good enough for him. Instead of dream ing of resenting the constraint and absence of cordiality in his greeting, she seemed honoured by hi3 kinsmanly notice, however slight. She had taken on the instant the humblest attitude of a hero-worshipper, and was ready to lavish whatever she possessed at the feet of her hero. In the meantime Constance had left Miss West and"], [148, "136 A MORNING MIST. Sir John sauntering together in silence back to the house. Miss West was looking at her companion eagerly, questioningly, as if she expected him to say something, were it but : \" What a pretty, refined-looking creature my sister has grown up ! She does you great credit ; I can see you have taken good care of her.\" Sir John was clearly sensible that some such remark was required from him, yet he could not bring himself to say anything more to the purpose than \" She is like her mother,\" a sentence which he had to follow up by the awkward explanation, \"I did not see Lady Beau champ when I was at Fairfields, but we met once acci dentally at a railway station, where she was pointed out to me.\" \" Constance is like her father also,\" said Miss West, in a nettled tone of voice ; \" she is a true Beauchamp.\" ' ' I am not sure whether that is an unmixed advan tage,\" said the young man again with his faint smile. Miss West was rendered still more on the defensive. She drew up her imposing figure, and said pointedly, \" She is much attached to her father's memory. She may well be. He was very fond of his little girl, and most anxious for her welfare. I may say, if you will allow me, that I have good reason to remember Sir Randal with gratitude. He was a true friend to me. I owe much of the peace and security of my declining years to his consideration.\" \" I am glad to hear'it,\" said Sir John, with apparent sincerity, if without any accompanying animation ; \"my father was bound to do what he did. The misfortune was that he did not, in the end, have it in his power to do more.\" It was not possible to quarrel with the statement, neither could Miss West say that she had any just reason to find fault with Sir John's conduct for the rest of the evening. He was a very different man from his father, that was plain ; but his position was altogether unlike that of the late Sir Randal, even after he was in the toils of his creditors. Sir John had grown up landless, without any private fortune save what remained"], [149, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 137 to him of his mother's modest dowry, and from the in terest of that and his pay he had to contribute to his sister's maintenance. He held a title which, without a corresponding estate, was little short of a mockery. No doubt he was in his own eyes, and in those of his set, a poor man, compelled, if he had either foresight or conscientiousness, to practise many acts of self-denial and self-suppression. Horse-racing, card-playing, reck less flirting, shooting-parties, excursions to Simla or the Nilgherries \u2014 the usual diversions of military men in India \u2014 were all cut down to the lowest figure where he was concerned. His prospects were by no means of a cheerful kind, unless on a side from which Miss West was womanly and delicate-minded enough, in her spinster's fastidiousness and sentimentality, to recoil. Sir John could only better his fortunes by contriving to make a rich marriage. He might sell his title, his birth, and his good presence for a solid equivalent in old acres or new guineas. There was not much to wonder at in the fact that he had something of the expression of a man to whom life was one long curbed effort, alternating with weariness, to be endured, not cured, to whom hstlessness is, for the most part, habitual. It was to the credit of Sir John's breeding, and cf his honesty of disposition, that he was not only courteous throughout, but that he sought in his calm, rather formal way to accommodate himself to the habits and standards of those who were doing their best to give him a welcome. He had very little to say, either to Miss West or to Constance. He was hardly more entertaining than was the boiler-maker. At the same time nothing which Sir John did say was meant to wound or affront his hearers. He was not going to visit his troubles on the innocent. And what a blessing it was in Miss West's deeply interested eyes that Constance had evidently taken to her brother, with his quiet lordly way, and had begun at once to look up to him, defer to him, and admire him with ardent, unstinted admiration ! This was the very attitude calculated to win the man, even though he resembled his reserved, hardly-used mother."], [150, "138 A MORNING MIST. Yes, Miss West could not deny that the first Lady Beauchamp had been a hardly-used woman, however much she might have inadvertently contributed to the ill-usage ; aud that the stamp of the rejection and deser tion under which she had writhed in silence, without bringing her wrongs into the coarse glare of a Divorce Court, remained impressed on her son. Constance was guiltless ; she was Sir John's sister on the father's side ; he was all she had in the shape of kindred, and yet it might take every appeal made to his manliness by her helplessness and dependence on him, every little grace provided by her beauty, and every innocent wile supplied by her girlish liking for him, to combat the enmity set between them by the two unhappy mothers who had been rivals. Miss West was right in many of her conclusions. Sir John Beauchamp was an exceedingly reserved man. His reserve was constitutional, not entirely the result of training, as his sister's shyness was. Everything which an isolated boyhood, and an almost equally isolated man hood, could do to confirm a hereditary tendency which, in its dumbness and blankness of expression, its power of repulsion where others are concerned, is not infre quently a source of misery to its possessor. He cannot overcome it, let him strive as he will. As for others, they are too frozen and benumbed in responsive sensi tiveness to do more than strike feeble blow7s at the dead wall which nothing can remove that stands even between the hopelessly reserved man or woman and his or her nearest and dearest. Yet, in spite of Sir John's reserve, he had a confiden tial talk with Miss West on the very night of his arrival, after she had sent Constance unwillingly to bed to get her ten o'clock beauty sleep. She had taken it every night of her life since she was old enough not to be carried off by a nurse a couple of hours earlier. His hostess believed she was only waiting for Sir John to light her candle and bid her good-night, after he had heard her apologies for not being able to furnish him with a smoking-room, and her deprecating suggestion"], [151, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 139 whether he could not make use of the harness-room close at hand, of which she gave him the key, together with that of the house-door ; but he meant more. \"I have something to say to you first, if you will allow me,\" he said, with the little nameless effort which was conspicuous in his manner. It lent an effect of slowness and languor to his speech, which had been doubtless increased by the recent illness from which he had hardly recovered. \" I'll not detain you more than a few minutes ; I think we ought to understand each other.\" Miss West bowed, and sat down again in her accus tomed seat. She did not think that there was much more to understand than what the pair already knew passably well. She seemed to recognise in the un necessarily disagreeable quarter of an hour which Sir John was about to inflict on both, the strain of inflexi bility in what he regarded as his duty, and the peculiar inclination to self-torture, which was probably derived from his mother, since it had been utterly foreign to his father's nature. But before the short interview was ended Miss West acknowledged with dismay the call for it. Her chief regret was, that she had not known certain items sooner. He told her, with remarkable simplicity and terseness, the amount of his income. It was not half what she had supposed it to be. His mother's portion had been, as often happens in such cases, greatly exag gerated. A part of it, which had not been tied up by her marriage settlement, had been alienated on account of the offence which she had given her father in refusing to expose her wretchedness and her husband's mis doings by claiming the indemnification which the Divorce Court undertakes to supply. The same grudge had caused Sir John's grandfather to bestow little bounty or favour ou his grandson, when the lad's father had succeeded in making utter shipwreck of his fortunes. In point of fact, Sir John had but a trifle more than his pay to support himself in his regiment, and maintain the empty honour of his title. On this trifle Miss West"], [152, "140 A MORNING MIST. had encroached by asking him to settle something on his sister. Sir John had managed to meet all the claims upon him by sticking to India, by practising such rigid economy as he was well aware had been far from render ing him popular in the eyes of his brother officers. He knew that he figured in their estimation as \" a poor devil\" who was about as niggardly as he was impe cunious. They would have been more ready to pardon him if he had run into debt, like many of the poorer officers, if he had \" got into a mess,\" if he had been obliged to sell out, and had withdrawn into obscure wretchedness, or had blown his brains out as the quickest solution of the difficulty. As it was, in his reticence and self-restraint he was a living reproach to many of his associates ; he was as lonely in his regiment as he had been when living on tolerance in his grand father's house, condemned to listen to bitter attacks on his father and forbidden to reply to them. In a similar manner he had been sent to school and college, and finally put into the army with little choice given to him, without spare pocket-money, with his expenses cut down \u25a0to the minimum, with an income insufficient to the usages of society or the wants of his class. He took what compensation he could from gratifying a few inex pensive tastes, and from cultivating an occasional friend ship, in spite of all his natural and acquired disadvan tages. He was well aware he was looked upon as queer, and he had a despairing conviction that, without any desire for eccentricity, on the contrary, with a shy man's loathing of it, he would grow odder the older he grew. What was left for Sir John save to put a brave man's face on his difficulties ? When, in spite of long season ing in a variety of insalubrious climates, he became invalided and had to return home for as short a space as would suffice to recruit him, he was compelled to quarter himself on a pair of unlucky women. He could not afford to do otherwise. This, and the amount of his income, formed the substance of his inevitable communication to Miss West. He made it plain, with a shade of grim-"], [153, "BROTHER AND SISTER. 141 ness in his languid courtesy. \" If you cannot keep me here,\" he ended, \" if I am too great an infliction, do not hesitate to say so. I can get my leave shortened, and go back at once. I daresay the return voyage will be enough to set me on my feet again.\" \" My dear Sir John, I am so sorry,\" said Miss West, with such heartfelt sympathy that the excellent woman grew quite pale in her distress. \" Oh, don't mistake me,\" she corrected herself hastily ; \" I am not sorry that you should be here. I am delighted if we can make you comfortable, aud Connie will be charmed to have your company. Where can you be better than in your sister's house ? What I meaut was, that if I had only known, if I had entertained the most distant suspicion that you were not richer, I should never have applied to you on Constance's behalf. I should have contrived something \u2014 I could have gone on teaching \u2014 I might have tried to make her independent \u2014 I might have trained her, though our original positions were quite different, to earn her living as I have earned mine.\" \" Don't speak of it,\" he said, shortly, with the suspicion of sternness which belonged to the man's habitual self repression ; \" of course Constance had to be maintained, and if my father was not able to provide for her properly there was nobody but me to do what was wanted. You were right to apply to me. I am only sorry that I have sent, as you know, such a wretched trifle ; but little as it is, it is all I can do at present. When I get another step I shall be able to send more ; and I have insured my life, so that in case of my death she will not be a loser.\" She was looking at him unsteadily. She knew by experience that the Beauchamps were a proud race, and she suspected that this member of the house was the proudest, as he was the poorest, of them all. She admired his honesty ; she would have liked to emulate it, but there was something which she could not tell him, not yet at least. She could only say earnestly : \" Sir John Beauchamp, if an old woman's respect and esteem are worth anything to you, you have them from"], [154, "142 A MORNING MIST. the bottom of my heart. I trust your sister will repay you for your loyalty and kindness.\" A look of relief and pleasure relaxed for an instant the somewhat hard setting of his handsome face, but as he was evidently eager to put an end to her thanks and to the discussion, she took the candle which he handed to her and bade him good-night. When Miss West reached her own room and closed the door, she sat down and looked helplessly before her : \" To think that I should have been led to rob that poor young man, who is badly enough off already, who ought never to have been made to pay for his father's vices ! As for my Constance, my poor child, I am afraid it will go hard with her, even though her brother has not failed her.\""], [155, "CHAPTER Xlf . SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME AT MAISONETTE. Constance was ready to endorse Miss West's solemn statement to her pupil : \" My dear, your brother is one in a thousand. I am more than pleased with him. I depend on your doing all you can to gratify him, and make his stay at Maisonette as agreeable to him as a man's \u2014 a young man's \u2014 stay in a household of women can well be made.\" Miss West sighed nervously. She had been in the habit of professing and believing that the extreme simplicity and economy carried out at Maisonette was the juste milieu between dignity and re finement on the one hand, and vulgar extravagance and waste on the other. But she was not so sure of her ground w*here the requirements of a man and an officer were con cerned, and with all the will to relax her rules, to con form to his standard, poor Miss West was sadly ham pered in ways and means. Constance, who lived like the lilies of the field and the birds of tbe air without thought or care on that head, had little idea what anxious planning and pinching were needed to keep up Maisonette and its grounds, its staff of maid-servants, Thomas, the phaeton and pony, in the style which Miss West considered due to the daughter of the late Sh Randal Beauchamp. If Constance had been charged the day before her brother came to satisfy his notions and devote herself to his well-being during his stay at Maisonette, she would probably have suggested that he should conform his standards and practices to theirs, and that what was good enough for ladies ought to be good enough for a man and a soldier. But she had already"], [156, "144 A MORNING MIST. passed under the fascination of Sir John. He was her hero of romance. He was dispossessed of Fairfields, as the Master of Ravenswood had been dispossessed of his lands. Sir John did not live in an old castle, certainly, and he had not a devoted retainer like Caleb Balderstone, while Constance fervently trusted that her brother would not be swallowed up in a quicksand, which, hap pily, was not an engine of death to be found everywhere. But he was equally worthy of the utmost honour, the utmost sympathy. Both her imagination and her heart were caught. If Sir John had been an ordinary young man \u2014 easy of access, careless ; if he had talked freely of himself and his doings, revealing their commonplaceness, or some thing worse, which would have grated on the girl's sensitive inexperience ; the spell would have been broken. But Sir John, handsome, aristocratic, yet modest-look ing, talked least of all of himself. He was prepared to accommodate himself to circumstances with a quiet adaptabihty which was not natural to the somewhat stiff and slow individuality of the man. It was bred of the life of discipline to which he had been subjected. He was a little formal by nature. He had always lived in grooves. It was a matter of course with him to uphold the panoply of state which Miss West had preserved all these years at Maisonette, more on her pupil's account than on her own. His assumption of the conventional dress-coat, his offering his arm to Miss West to take her in to dinner, his opening of the door for Constance, and turning over her music for her, when she would accept the service \u2014 were so many acts that he could not help performing, of which he was hardly conscious, so much were they part and parcel of the man. Very becoming acts they seemed to Miss West ; very graceful, with a dash of chivalry in them, they appeared to Constance, who was totally unaccustomed to a man's being in the house with her, apparently with no other end in view than to take care of her, and render life easier for her. The little ceremonies seemed to invest the daily round with a new elegance and refinement."], [157, "SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME. 145 Miss West need not have feared the absence of luxuries in her house, where Sir John was concerned. He found fault with nothing, looked askance at nothing. He accepted the primitive soups, plain joints, insipid puddings, and unsophisticated salads and sauces, which a not too accomplished cook anxiously provided for his consumption as irreproachable fare for a gentleman. The gentleman at the foot of the table had no criticism for the claret, though he would not be persuaded to drink more than a couple of glasses, and Miss West found he never touched the decanters of port and sherry which she took care should accompany the choice of fruit, with which he was left when the ladies preceded him to the drawing-room. Sir John was accustomed to a well managed, carefully studied mess-table, but he could also fare as temperately, well-nigh ascetically, as most people. There were occasions when he had positively to fast in private, because he had at other times to feast in public. He must miss his mess, as he missed his drill, his horse exercise, the official days when he had to wear his war paint, hia mufti; but he had always the consolation of knowing that he was not running up mess-bills, or wearing out his costly uniform, that he was positively recouping himself for his travelling expenses by staying where there was a place for him \u2014 with his sister. Saving in some form had become the grand necessity, if it was not the master passion, of poor Sir John Beauchamp's life. He soon fell into the ways of the house, sedulously cared for and guarded from annoyance as he was by its mistresses. The dining-room was given up to him for his morning-room, where he could read or write, or pace up and down, or stretch himself on the sofa, with even less chance of intrusion or disturbance than when he was in his bungalow. He had never come across an orderly who was so jealously mindful of his rights and privileges as his young sister was pleased to constitute herself. He might have smoked in the dining room, or for that matter in his bedroom (the best in the house, if he had known it), as well as in the harness room set apart for the convenience of him and his cigars 10"], [158, "146 A MORNING MIST. \u2014 alas ! they had to be restricted in number, and of an inferior brand \u2014 without censure, supposing he had chosen to be guilty of the outrage. When Sir John was tired of solitude, his presence in the drawing-room was hailed as the greatest compliment to its occupants. Constance particularly \u2014 Miss West, too, if he stipulated for her presence \u2014 were contentedly at his disposal, ready to contribute to his amusement, walking with him, talking with him, giving him a little music when he was in the mood iu the evening, playing cards, or chess, or reversi with him. He was not very brilliant company, but neither were they brilliant com pany, though Miss West was eminently sensible, while Constance was bright with youth, health, good spirits, and fair abilities. The women were tremulously desirous cf suiting his taste, and not worrying or overtiring him. \" Poor things ! They are making a tame cat of me,\" he told himself, with a mild shrug of his broad shoulders. \" I should be an ungrateful dog not to feel obliged to them, only I hope they will not end by doing worse \u2014 that is, making an ass of me \u2014 since I have never been used to being coddled or elected into an absolute monarch.-' He was gently bored, but he had been exposed to much worse than boredom, and he could stand that as well as other evils. He was too much of a gentleman at heart to betray his trials on this score to those who were so earnest in seeking to please him. He could not resist being won by what appeared to him the disinterested kindness of his entertainers, seeing that they could get no more money from him than the small sum he allowed them, while at present he was a burden on them. Neither could he escape being touched by Constance's enthu siasm in relation to him \u2014 he had done so little to call it forth. He had not thought much of his sister, or cared even to see her. They might actually never have known each other, if he had not been compelled to return to England and constraiued to take refuge at Maisonette as the only place where he could afford to stay, because he had some claim to free quarters there. He had felt"], [159, "SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF A T HOME. 147 it rather mean in him to put in his claim, though, when it comes to that, necessity has no law, and here was Constance watching him, waiting on his pleasure, hang ing on his smile, as if the two had known each other all their lives and been the most attached of whole \u2014 not half \u2014 brothers and sisters. It was all very strange and pleasant, if it was also fatiguing, to one whose lines had not often been cast in pleasant places. It was a little embarrassing also to a man who had not reckoned himself a family man, and suddenly found himself invested with family ties by virtue of a hitherto unknown half-sister and her ci-devant governess. Would any other fool of a woman, young or old, pro pose to deify a man as Constance was doing to him \u2014 the dull, sordid fellow, it often seemed to him, he was growing more and more ? And Constance was a lovely little girl in her simplicity arid innocence \u2014of whom any brother might have been proud. She was his sister in a sense. If he was all that she had in the shape of kindred, as Miss West had said, she was all that he had since his poor mother was dead, long ago ; and her relations, who had grudged their obligations to him in his youth, were of small account to him in his manhood. Sir John set himself shyly and a little awkwardly to repay* some of Constance's devotion. He challenged her to shoot at the antediluvian target with him, and corrected some of her worse faults as an archer. He set aside Thomas, and drove the ladies in their phaeton behind the ambling pony. He proposed to take out Constance, and let her drive him, in order to give her lessons in the art \u2014 a proposal which was received with overflowing gratitude, as if he had bought her a horse, and either bought or hired a companion-horse in order to become her riding-master. It had been a vexation to Miss West that her early education had been deficient in some respects, so that she could not inaugurate Miss Beauchamp in the gentle art of pony-driving, while the elder lady's prim habit of mind had caused her to demur at entrusting Thomas with the task. But when it came to that, every trifling favour, or piece of attention, which"], [160, "148 A MORNING MIST. Sir John bestowed on either of his hostesses, was received with such wistful complacency on Miss West's part, such an ecstasy of pleasure on Constance's, as fairly to abash the bestower of the favours. Among the inexpensive tastes which Sir John had been driven to cherish in his lonely boyhood, and scarcely less lonely exile, were those of an amateur naturalist and artist. He was a very tolerable entomo- logist and botanist, and sketched decently \u2014 not, as Constance rushed to the conclusion, with the masterly touch of genius, but so as to preserve, without great injustice, evidence of agreeable impressions, and to occupy hours which would otherwise have dragged too heavily. Constance knew little or nothing of drawing, for she had received her entire education from Miss West, who was just so enlightened on art as to decline to do more than impart the bare rudiments which were included in her scheme of teaching. She w*ould, at least, pre serve her pupil from the monstrosities in pencil, chalk, and water-colour permitted by former generations. When Sir John saw the delighted interest which Con stance took in a few attempts he made to secure the remembrance of the soft, rich Oxford scenery \u2014 the sleepy meadows and the drowsy cattle, the luxuriant foliage, the gently flowing brooklets, dreaming their way to the Isis, the peaceful, grey church-towers, and the quaint, yellow-walled, olive-thatched cottages \u2014 he was inspired to propose to give her a few lessons in his simple art, and was amply rewarded by the joyful mixture of pride and humility with which the proposal was met. Never was pupil more grateful or more disposed to hang breathlessly on the lips and hands of a teacher. He could almost have laughed at the importance which both Constance and Miss West attached to the perform ance when he considered the slender nature of his attainments. Yet he could free himself from having been guilty of humbugging since he had done his best to open these credulous feminine eyes to the inadequacy of his gifts. But the eyes would see everything about"], [161, "SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF A T HOME. 149 him through rose-coloured spectacles. The idea of his being viewed through such a medium ! Sir John had driven Constance over to Dorriugton, that they might select some drawing materials for her at the principal bookseller's shop. But the primary effect of the expedition was that she came home full of an oil painting of Miss Hobbs's, which had been sent to the shop to be framed \u2014 picture-framing being one branch of the bookseller's business. The picture was then to be forwarded to London to one of the exhibitions. \" So much for being a rich man's daughter,\" Miss West had remarked with a little acrimony. \" No doubt if Miss Hobbs had not been the great boiler-maker's daughter her artistic faculty would never have been dis covered. She would have stood as good a chance of being rejected as ninety-nine out of every hundred of the candidates. As it is, her work will be accepted. She will pose as a clever and distinguished artist, and appro priate the place on the wall, the credit, the price, if the picture is to be sold \u2014 which is very likely, since girls like Miss Hobbs stick at nothing \u2014 that would have been better bestowed on a poor man's daughter. I do think the craving for display and notoriety which is so con spicuous in modern young ladies is very reprehensible.\" \" But, Miss West, John thinks the picture exceedingly good, quite wonderful for a woman's work,\" objected Constance. \" Yes,\" said Sir John, thus dragged into the conver sation, \" my opinion is not of great value, as I have explained to Constance. I have not even seen any European exhibition for more than a decade. But as far as I can judge, this picture is capital, and it is the next thing to learned work, unless great advances have been made in the schools within the last ten or twelve years.\" \" I have heard that Miss Hobbs has had great advan tages in studying, both at home and abroad,\" admitted Miss West, \" but that does not make a painter, Connie.\" \" No, but it may help to bring about a very creditable performance, which anybody might be willing to own,\""], [162, "150 A MORNING MIST. said Sir John. \" I only wish I could do anything half so good,\" he added, under the obligation laid upon him to show himself and his doings in their proper light. \" Oh, John ! how can you say anything of the kind ? \" Constance ventured to contradict her brother in her zeal for his honour. \" I am sure you could do ever so much better if you cared to try \u2014 not that I did not think Miss Hobbs's picture very nice and natural. I do not know, of course, but I must say this, if it was learned in the execution, the subject was unpretending enough. It was just a bit of ordinary sky and a corner of a common, Miss West, with two little ragged, hungry children and a lean dog \u2014 such a tatterdemalion group as we have passed times without number when tramps were squatting in the neighbourhood.\" \" You have hit the salient points, Connie,\" said Sir John, with the smile that just hovered about the corners of his moustache. \"I am not sure that you have not brought them into too much prominence \u2014 the hunger of the children, for instance.\" \" Oh, did you not think they looked hungry ? \" asked Constance, innocently. \" If she had models of the kind, I trust she asked them into the Kingsmeadows kitchen, and saw that they had a good meal,\" said Miss West, still speaking, sarcastically; \"the broken meat in that quarter would be a treasure -trove to tramps.\" \" Perhaps it might be dangerous to give them a taste of it,\" suggested Sir John. \"The good things of this world had better not be dangled tantalisingly before the eyes of poor beggars,\" he finished, with a passing sigh. \" I think the Hobbses are generous and charitable,\" said Constance, carelessly ; \" both Mr. and Mrs. Parry, when they come here, are always praising them.\" And the conversation dropped. The discussion was resumed some time afterwards by Miss West, when she and Sir John happened to be tete a-tete. \"You said Constance had hit on the salient points"], [163, "SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF A T HOME. 151 of Miss Hobbs's picture,\" remarked Miss West, with a searching glance in Sir John's face; \" the percep tion of them must be quite intuitive. Does that not show that she has some artistic talent of her own \u2014 undeveloped, of course? She has always been fond of engravings and illustrations; aud she is deeply interested in your sketches. It fills me with regret to think that I was not qualified to educate her in this respect. I had literally no art education, and she may have beeu crippled in powers whose existence I did not suspect. Regular instruction might not be too late. I need not say I do not mean the lessons from j*ourself, which you are too kind iu giving her, and which it would be tresspassing ou the well-earned leisure of your leave to expect you to continue ; but if you think she can make future use of a thorough course of art study I shall not rest till it is put within her reach ; I w7ill secure it for her at any sacrifice.\" He was looking at the old teacher, and listening to the earnestness of her appeal in surprise : \" I beg your pardon, but I do not really see the least sign of artistic genius in my sister. She has much the same liking for the subject that I have, and if she will carry out the few hints I can give her she may arrive at the same point, and be able to please and amuse herself without giving deadly offence to her more gifted neighbours. But, as you yourself said, a little while ago, a great deal more than that \u2014 or than any kind of teaching, indeed \u2014 is wanted to make even a painter of interiors and flower pieces. If it had been otherwise, if Constance were a genius in this line, or in any other, I have also your word for it that the possession might be an endowment of the nature of a white elephant to her. I quite agree with you. She is not a rich man's daughter, but she is sufficiently, if moderately, provided for. Why should she come before the public, and expose herself to the glare of its notice, and the pain of hostile criticism ? I have not considered the subject, but apparently you have, and I have no doubt you are right, though our opinion is"], [164, "152 A MORNING MIST. against the modern practice, when we condemn a public career for a girl, unless where there is no other re source.\" She continued to look at him anxiously, wistfully. \"Then I may take it for granted that you would not approve of such a course for your sister?\" she said, slowly. \"Certainly not,\" he answered with decision. \"But remember \u2014 \" he qualified his statement \u2014 \" I don't claim any right to control her actions. We have seen too little of each other ; I have not been able to do enough for her, to entitle me to adopt that tone.\" His face hardened as he spoke. \"I need not tell you, Miss West \u2014 \" he forced himself to begin again \u2014 \" that there are circumstances in my family history, mine and poor Constance's, that had much better be forgotten. It can serve no good purpose to recall them to the public mind. My sister could not well afford, even if she were a genius, to be in the public's mouth.\" Something at once ludic rous and pathetic in the idea seized hold of him as he uttered the words. \" We are tilting at windmills. Poor Connie, she is a charming little girl ! The more I know of her the better I like her for a sister. She is indebted to you beyond measure, and so am I, for turning her out as she is. You must forgive a blundering, flounder ing fellow for not saying so much as this long before now. I am aware \u2014 \" he went on hurriedly \u2014 \"that you have had the whole formation of her character. But if you will forgive me for saying it, though you have brought her up a perfect little lady, so far as I can judge, which is, I suspect, what all highly educated modern girls are not \u2014 I should not expect that, save by her beauty, and that is rather girlish loveliness than superb Cleopatra charms, your pupil would ever set the Thames on fire.\" \"You are very good, Sir Johu, very good to thank me for what I have done with your sister,\" said Miss West, very much on her manners, and hovering between an inclination to feel nettled and a counter-inclination to feel gratified. \" I assure you I had excellent material"], [165, "SIR JOHN MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME. 153 to work upon. I am glad \u2014 you cannot think how glad,\" she went on simply, \" that you are getting fond of her. But \u2014 but you do not seem to find even her music out of the way, aud I have taken great pains with that, such store was set on music when I was young. Connie has an ear and a voice, and was always punctual in doing her practising, though I cannot say that she liked it. I thought that was to be her chief accomplishment. I did indulge a hope that she would be a little out of the common in her music.\" Sir John hated to give pain quite as much as Sir Randal had detested the thankless task, but he, Sir John, was no more capable of glossing over the truth than his father had been of telling a plain, unvarnished story, uncoloured by the shifting kaleidoscope of his sanguine, impressionable imagination. \" I do not think my sister is out of the way in anything, save her beauty and her sweetness,\" he answered, gravely. \" I was disposed to think you agreed with me that it was best so, and that in this respect she had really the inheritance which was most desirable for a woman. She is very pretty and very good \u2014 goodness itself to me. She has all the wits and the culture \u2014 thanks to you \u2014 that a woman need desire ; she deserves to be happy, and I wish I could predict a bright future for her. But though her playing and singing are very pleasant and winning, like the child herself \u2014 a man could not crave anything more soothing to kill time after the day's work and care \u2014 they are hardly what one would call first rate, not at all in the prima donna style.\" Sir John, who did not often laugh, broke into a snigger at the bare suggestion. He was ready to make amends the next moment: \"What of that? It is rather a relief to be delivered from talent for which there is no outlet. You would never propose the concert room or the operatic stage as a field for my sister ? \" Miss West was again provoked. She was also dis appointed in a forlorn hope that her musical efforts in connection with Constance might bear golden fruit. Musical standards must have changed since her day."], [166, "154 A MORNING MIST. (they had changed tremendously). Yet she was tempted to coincide with the apologetic confession by which the gentlema,n tried to make amends for any annoyance he had given to a woman for whose worth and sense, in spite of her present fancy, he had long entertained a sincere respect. \" You know I am not a musical fellow,\" said Sir John. \" I am still more deficient in music than in art. I can draw a little and wash in a paltry sketch, but I cannot boast of being able to tootle on a single musical instru ment ; even the banjo is beyond me.\" \" There are difficulties in every career,\" Miss West replied, not, as it seemed, very relevantly, \" but I have been told that concert rooms, and the stage itself, are differently conducted and are frequented by other aspirants than such places were wont to be in the days when all sober-minded people were forced to regard them as objectionable. Even the career of a governess \u2014 of which I am qualified to speak \u2014 though no doubt the standard has altered in that also,\" she broke off, w*ith a little bitterness, \" while it is much less exposed than that of a singer, is not only unremunerative by comparison, it has drawbacks of its own.\" He could not see what the good woman was driving at, he told himself; so he followed the course most natural to him and said no more."], [167, "CHAPTER XIII. THE USAGES OF SOCIETY. Sie John had, perforce, withdrawn himself to such an extent from going into company that he was not struck, as another man might have been, by the extreme retirement in which the ladies lived at Maison ette. He was not moved to ask himself whether it was the wisest course in the circumstances. He was not even roused by the little pause which occurred before the gentlemen in the neighbourhood proceeded to make his acquaintance. As a matter of fact, it was a mere impressive pause before a general demonstration. Sir John was all right, apart from his landlessness and poverty, for which a certain amount of sympathy was not wanting. The age was too unromantic, too pluto cratic, for the Oxford and Buckinghamshire squires to convert him into a hero of romance, as his sister had con verted him. But no class stands more closely by its order than the upper class, or retains so much esprit de corps to the last. Sir John was Sir John. Everything that was known of the poor fellow, who had been made to suffer for the sins of others, was greatly to his credit. His mother had been a lady by birth and without reproach, unless to be ill-used and worsted constituted a reproach. Some of the country people, in the limitation of the country and the world, had come across members of her family, the Ashleys, and at one time had the name on their visiting-lists, just as every body of any position in the last generation, had skaken their heads over the spendthrift fascinations and misdeeds of Sir Randal Beauchamp. Of course, the"], [168, "156 A MORNING MIST. county-gentry in that corner of the shire meant to call on Sir John, and ask him to join the hunt if his stay in England w*ere to last into the winter. The slight sense of awkwardness wdiich produced the delay in the fulfilment of the county's intentions was caused by the existence and vicinity of Constance. It seemed that Sir John did acknowledge his sister, and meant to bring her as much to the front as circumstances would permit ; and without question Constance's mother, though neither a born lady nor of irreproachable behaviour, had been Lady Beauchamp. Sir Randal had, in popular phrase, made an honest woman of her by marrying her, and there was neither legal warrant nor generous reasoning in ostracising his daughter. Still it had been done, more or less, whether or not the cue had been supplied by the absurd seclusion in which the girl's governess had elected to keep her. It was not easy for the ladies of the neighbourhood, on the mere appearance of Sir John to disallow the inter dict which had been established, and begin a visiting acquaintance with the sister who had grown up among them, just as the gentlemen commenced an acquaintance with the brother on his arrival from India. Even polite audacity boggled a little at the feat, though some among the Beauchamps' neighbours accomplished it. There was the slight hesitation referred to ; and then by unanimous consent the main body of the gentlemen called on Sir John, while the main body of the ladies waited for some accidental encounter, or opportune excuse, which was safe to occur sooner or later, in order to follow suit. A few people \u2014 the Parrys and the Hobbses \u2014 had known Miss Beauchamp even before Lady Theresa called on her. They must entertain her, when they were entertaining her brother : the recusants might come across her, or she might appear with her brother in the poultry department of the agricultural show, which was to be held this year at Dorrington, or at the last cricket-match, or at the first meet of the season, which was ahvays a considerable gathering. Introductions might be man \u0153uvred for and obtained, on any of these occasions, and"], [169, "THE USAGES OF SOCIETY. 157 then the next step in the acquaintance would be com paratively simple. Constance was happily in profound ignorance of all these tacit understandings and arrangements. She was gratified by the gentlemen's cards being left for Sir John, and treasured them as a tribute to his rank and general importance. She furtively watched tbe figures \u2014 she was generally familiar with them, and with their names and local habitations \u2014 that walked up the gravel sweep, or dismounted there, and were shown by Jane (since Thomas was purely an out-of-doors servant) into the dining-room to greet Sir John. Constance was so accustomed to be ignored that it did not disturb her equanimity in the least when she continued to be so. She was so young in mind and spirit that she did not expect anything else. She had made no plans of a different nature, and she was not piqued by their non-fulfilment. When the exceptions to the ignoring came to pass, when Lady Theresa Langton and Lady Theresa's copyists took it upon them to call, eventually, Constance was not flattered. She was not nearly so much fluttered and excited as poor Miss West showed herself. Constance took it all \u2014 the non-notice and the notice \u2014 equally as a thing of course. Miss West marvelled at her pupil's good breeding, and was proud of it. As she did not share it she was left to speculate whether it was an attribute of \"birth.\" If so.it must have come on the father's side. As an additional proof of this, poor Lady Beauchamp, the second Lady Beau champ of Sir Randal's day, had been the most desperately nervous, the most deeply abashed, in spite of her husband's indulgence, the most crushed, of women whom it had ever been Miss West's fortune to know. It had been these unworldly, unadaptable qualities which had disarmed the righteous spinster. Oddly enough, the very persons whose social advances to her brother appeared, in Constance's partial eyes, as offences against his high and mighty claims, were mem bers of the family who had not overlooked her, who had sought her and Miss West out, in conspicuous defiance"], [170, "158 A MORNING MIST. of the code which forbids the last-comer to make the first advance. Constance's prejudices had been so far subdued by the wonderful glories and hospitalities of Kingsmeadows, which she and Miss West had been betrayed into beholding and accepting, and by the agreeable surprise of hearing that Miss Hobbs, who was so handsome, clever, and charmingly dressed \u2014 nobody could deny that, though she was only a boiler-maker's daughter, and her mother a dreadful woman \u2014 had cherished the remembrance of her, Constance, as a child ; and, above all, had seen and admired her father. But each prejudice bristled amain when the male Hobbses took it upon them to call on Sir John. It was really only the young man who called personally. The boiler-maker did not see fit to spare the time. He con tented himself with sending his card. But surely, though Sir John's sister had been subjected to the intru sion of trade, it ought not to have been inflicted on Sir John himself, a gentleman of long descent, a baronet and an officer. It was vulgar to dwell on such distinc tions, still Constance could not help knowing that her brother was the thirteenth baronet, counting down from a hoary Sir Hildebrand, who had won his spurs on one of the battle-fields in the Wars of the Roses. What were the Hobbses then ? Doubtless cloddish peasants, hardly even fit to serve as men-at-arms, under their feudal lords. They ought to remember this, it would be much more becoming if they did. Not all their superior advantages of money, of fine furniture, hot house flowers, dainty dishes and pretty clothes ; not even their education, in a younger generation, could obliterate their origin, and the manner in which they had risen above it, Oh, silly, immature, ignorant young Con stance ! As if the latter day were not the reign of the wealthiest ! As if malleable iron and steam were in the very nature of the metal, and of the water held in sus pension, sources of disgrace and degradation ; as if their influence in the nineteenth century were a sorry trifle, to be treated with withering contempt ! The worst of it was that Sir John, in his quiet way,"], [171, "THE USAGES OF SOCIETY. 159 w*ould not look upon young Joe Hobbs's call as an impertinence. Sir John was actually so perverse as to take the pains to discover that a friend and fellow student of young Hobbs at Cambridge was a subaltern in Sir John's regiment in India, and might serve as an intermediate link, on w*hich the two men could hang a friendship. \" Young Hobbs has been so good-natured as to offer me a choice of mounts from their stable if I am here when the hunting season begins,\" Sir John observed, coolly, as if the favour were all on one side. \"It is awfully friendly. He says he has not always time to hunt. Fancy a happy fellow with a good stud at his command not having time to hunt ! I suppose the old man keeps the son's nose at the grindstone.\" \"I don't know,\" suid Constance, doubtfully. \"His sister said he had a great many pst schemes which he was trying to work out. I suppose he is a meddling busybody, though he is pleasant enough to talk to, and I must say he was kind to Miss West and me, when we could not get off from calling and staying to lunch at Kingsmeadows the other day.\" She made the amend ment with a shade of penitence. The brother and sister stood idling in the Maisonette porch together. \"You do not like the Hobbses ? \" he questioned her, being sufficiently interested to exercise a little penetration, while he raised his heavily lidded eyes and looked her in the face. If che were a sleeping princess, he had not altogether escaped the drowsy attributes of the prevailing languor. \" Oh ! I don't dislike them,\" replied Constance, pluck ing a dead leaf or two from the clematis ; \" they are simply not in my style. Miss Hobbs is very nice, and her brother is well enough, if he would keep himself still and not grimace. I suppose the old man is what might have been expected \u2014 he is only a great tradesman, you know. But Mrs. Hobbs is just dreadful. She is so sharp-look ing ; she does not care what she does, and she speaks like a washerwoman \u2014 well, perhaps not like a washer woman exactly, but like the wife of a small shopkeeper.\""], [172, "160 A MORNING MIST. Sir John laughed lazily, as he leant against one of the rustic pillars. \"I am afraid you are behind the times, Connie. It is the great tradesmen, as you call them, who rule us now, and if they do it well why shouldn't they ? They are familiar with contracts and bargains, and this is the age of contracts and bargains. I don't mean to speak disparagingly. Why should huckstering \u2014 as its enemies are pleased to call it \u2014 be worse than helping yourself and keeping the plunder, whether you have any real title to it or not ? The big tradesmen have the tin and take the bother ; well, let them manage the world, if they can.\" \"But they can't do the fighting,\" said Constance, with a mixture of w7ilfulness and indignation on behalf of the fighters. \" I am not so sure of that,\" said Sir John, philosophi- cally. \" The army would be in a bad plight without the contractors and the capitalists behind them. Besides, my dear, all the big tradesmen's sons go in for the army as a gentleman's calling. I am not certain that they are not mistaken,\" he added, meditatively; \"but they don't consult a poor beggar like me. Competitive exam- ination is no barrier to them,\" he went on grimly, with a dim comprehension of the advantage of having a sympathetic listener. ' ' They are the sons of hard headed men, and have generally had every advantage of education.\" \" It is a shame that they should be allowed to compete with gentlemen ! \" cried Constance, hotly. \" I am glad that Mr. Hobbs's son \u2014 ' Mr. Hobbs, junior,' he is called at the foundry, I suppose,\" she said, with a slight eleva tion of her chin, \" I am glad he has not gone into the army.\" \"Why not?\" asked Sir John, with a return to his somewhat limp and dreary apathy. \" Why should the country lose some of its best officers in order to bolster up the degenerated and dwindling sprigs of quality who are not worth the sacrifice? Only I wish the trades men-fellows would not go in for gorgeous kits, and end less outlay in their amusements, involving their unfor-"], [173, "THE USAGES OF SOCIETY. 161 tunate comrades in a style of living not in keeping with their narrow means. But I shall see for myself presently what our friends at Kingsmeadows are like,\" he finished, laying a mildly mischievous emphasis on the term \"friends.\" \"They are no friends of mine, or of Miss West's,\" Constance rebutted the statement with spirit. \" It does not make us friends, does it, that Miss Hobbs recollected me as a little girl, and was very merry and agreeable over the recollection, and over poor Papa's having once given her some fruit? I wonder if they could have been so poor then as not to be able to buy fruit. It sounds strange, because now they have such loads of peaches and melons and things. I never tasted a pineapple grown in an English pinery till I ate a bit at their table ; I suppose you will say ' Such is life ; ' and I am not ungrateful. I am aware that pineapples and melons may stand for bread and salt, so that I have no intention of cutting any of the Hobbses when I meet them.\" Constance announced her \" no intention \" with a comical air of ineffable superiority. \" Still, that does not make us friends even though you should return Mr. Joe Hobbs's visit,\" she suggested, tenta tively. \" Of course I shall return it,\" answered Sir John, with more animation than usual. \" You would not have me, any more than yourself, fail in the common forms of politeness ? After the fellow was good enough to offer me a mount, too, when for anything that he knew I might break his mare's knees, even if I stopped short of breaking her neck and my own.\" Sir John shut his sister's mouth, for her attitude of unstinted hero-w7orship did not admit of disputing the wisdom of his judgment ; yet she was scarcely qualified to measure the height and depth of the favour conferred by Joe Hobbs. She was even unreasonably aggrieved by his presuming to confer a favour in the circumstances. She came to the conclusion that there was a freemasonry between young men, but she thought young Hobbs ought not to have traded upon it \u2014 granted that he was 11"], [174, "162 A MORNING MIST. a tradesman ; and she did not feel quite sure that Sir John was not just a little too forbearing and long-suffer ing in allowing it. Constance was not a little anxious to hear her brother's opinion of the owners of Kingsmeadows. When he came back from paying his visit, she sought to arouse Miss West to an equal amount of interest, but naturally Miss West was pre-occupied with the burden of keeping house for Sir John, as well as for his sister, and was ready to acquiesce in all he did and said in a manner not like her old self. Yet even Miss West, in her new character, betrayed some disturbance of mind when Sir John, without any great departure from his natural reserve, declared his general approbation of the Hobbses, to the little circle in the Maisonette drawing-room. \" But it was only the gentlemen whose calls you returned ? \" Constance ventured to cross-examine her brother, while she stitched industriously at a piece of embroidery. \" No, I saw the whole lot, including some nice chil dren,\" he told her. \"Are you fond of children?\" she inquired, eagerly, diverted from the main subject by the delight of dis covering a new virtue in this adorable brother of hers. \" Ye \u2014 s, I think I do like kids,\" he acknowledged the soft impeachment, \" if they are nice, as I said, and kept in their proper place. I am not at all clear that I should care for the cartsful of Riversmeadows children I heard of in the background. Miss Hobbs aud her brother were setting off with their own small fry, to entertain a crowd of juvenile neighbours in a field near the village. I found the whole place in commotion, and a family gathering on the lawn. Young Hobbs asked if I would excuse him, and proposed our stepping out by the French window of the library, that he might introduce me to his people. When those of them who were to attend the school-treat had started, I returned with Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs to the house to improve our acquaint- ance."], [175, "THE USAGES OF SOCIETY. 163 \"And what do you think of them?\" inquired Con stance, breathlessly, letting her work fall on her knee. \" Oh ! he is all right,\" answered Sir John, with more than ordinary promptness on his part. \" He is a trade genius, or something of the sort, with sufficient shrewd ness to keep to the line in which he is unapproachable. Nobody could laugh at old Hobbs, or think of him other wise than as a boon to his generation.\" \"A tolerably heavy boon,\" put in Constance, with a shade of pettish flippancy. \" Most boons weigh heavily,\" said her brother, com posedly. \"The son may have hobbies which are objec tionable \u2014 very likely he has, but there is nothing else to find fault with in him. He is not a bit of a cad, and I for one am bound to say that he is uncommonly good natured and confiding. As for Miss Hobbs, everybody must agree that she is a charming girl, though she may be suspected of hobbies also. I have a notion, however, there is more line allowed to wOmen, especially young and handsome women, in that respect than was granted to them formerly. But I should say it would be the old lady who would take best in society. I should have thought that you would have seen that, Constance.\" Constance sat speechless. It was then that Miss West roused herself from the reverie in which she was generally plunged in those days, and said, in a voice well-nigh sepulchral in its intensity, while she came to a dead stop in her netting, her foot balanced in her stirrup, her netting-needle suspended in her hand : \" You do as tonish me, Sir John ! \" \"What! Mrs. Hobbs, with her skinflint look and manner, her queer phrases and her grammar as halting as her h's?\" cried Constance, incredulous even of the. words of her oracle. Sir John stood firm, though he also showed the ingenu ousness and deference to his companions which was to them so delightful a feature in his character. \" You ladies should know English society better than I, of course,\" he said, not without an unspoken convic tion that Miss West and Constance, in leading their"], [176, "164 A MORNING MIST. secluded life, had missed all familiarity with modern English society. \" But will you tell me,\" went on Sir John, \" what is the meaning of the great popularity of Americans in the upper classes in England in the present day? Of course, there are Americans and Americans. Our brother Jonathan and his womankind may be as cultured and polished as we are ; but books and con- temporary gossips lie tremendously, if it is not the quaintly plain-spoken, quizzical American millionaires and their households, regular Yankees, New Englanders if possible, puritanical on the one side, aud sharp as needles on the other, who are the most welcome in what are called aristocratic circles. These good people strike the observer as the real article, besides being a blessed relief from the dead level of sameness and conventionality into which we are all steeped to the lips. I saw a little of travelling Americans and their popularity out in India,\" explained Sir John, apologising courteously for his independent conclusions and his unwonted talkativeness. \"But Mrs. Hobbs is not an American,\" urged Con stance, discontentedly. \" She is as good in her way,\" maintained Sir John, \" and so would all the English nouveaux riches be if they only knew their advantages, and had the courage and honesty to be themselves. When a primitive rich woman is neither a sloven nor a fool \u2014 I take it Mrs. Hobbs is neither, little as I have seen of her \u2014 she is mistress of the situation if she likes. Her homeliness is racy, her very prejudices are refreshing to those who are sick of well-bred uniformity.\" This was a new light with a vengeance to be thrown on the facts of the life around her. Constance, un- accustomed to such an illumination, blinked in its beams."], [177, "CHAPTrR XIV. CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.' After all Constance's \"geeks and flouts\" \u2014 to employ the expressive language of our grandmothers \u2014 it was to the kindly instincts of the Hobbses that she was indebted for the first dinner invitation which coupled her name with her brother's. Miss West's name was also in cluded in the invitation, which she at once declined. \" My dear, you do not need me when you have your brother's escort,\" she told Constance. \"If he is serious, as I have no doubt he is, in regarding the family at Kings meadows as visitable where you are concerned, he is sufficient to go with you, and you don't want a chaperon. I have been so long out of society, even after the fashion in w*hich I was in it,\" said Miss West, with dry, digni fied literalness, \" that I do not care to return to it, save on your account. There is no question of your welfare in this case.\" To herself Miss West said, \" No, of course, I don't care to go. What pleasure would it be to me to dine amidst all the lavishness and gorgeousness at the boiler maker's table, among company that I make no question would look down upon me, and consider my presence out of place ? The only satisfaction to me would be to see any sensation Connie might create among the other guests. I fancy the whole county is bowing down to the man of gold and boilers. I should have liked to witness her brother's pleasure in her success. He could not fail to be pleased. I think he is getting fond of her ; he is too honorable and right-minded not to be fair to her and to return her affection, poor child !"], [178, "166 A MORNING MIST. Though she has been, oh dear ! such a drain upon his slender purse, poor Sir John ! Besides, I have nothing to wear ! I have plenty of good clothes \u2014 only too good if I had known everything, but I have no proper dinner dress, and I shall certainly not lay out a penny which may be better bestowed on what I have done very well without all these years.\" Constance could not urge Miss West to do what she did not care to do. Her own feelings were divided between the delight of going out to dinner with her brother, Sir John, and a considerable spice of mortifi cation in connection with the knowledge that it was to Kingsmeadows she was going. But Sir John persisted in looking and speaking as if it were a piece of attention on the Hobbses' part to send them so speedy an invitation, as if the Beauchamps owed anything so old-fashioned as gratitude to their host and hostess for being mindful and attentive. Up to this time Constance had been so accustomed to depend upon Miss West, and to be supplied by her instrumentality with all that a young lady of gentle birth and breeding could want, that she had not even any great girlish anxiety about her dress. Miss West would see to it, as she had always seen to it. Constance was not over much moved on her own account by the glimpse she had got of Mattie Hobbs's elegance, and the stories she had read, which were recalled to her mind by her brother's allusion to the prominent part played by Americans in modern English society. She had made the acquaintance \u2014 in print and on canvas \u2014 of fair Bar barians in satin and diamonds in cottage gardens at noonday ; of belles Americaines in the ineffable splendour of appropriate toilets by Worth, brought to a fine finish by bouquets of costly orchids, displayed at every hour of the tw7enty-four. But if le grand simple, as shown in her own surroundings, and if a considerable indifference to dress in the abstract, apart from what was daintily fresh and delicately nice in its suitability, were marks of a true aristocrat, then poor Bessie Lane's daughter was aristocratic to the backbone."], [179, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.\" 167 To Constance's surprise, Miss West was not so loftily superior and philosophic on his occasion as she had been wont to appear. She was what Constance called quite fussy about the girl's dress for a \" function,\" to speak the jargon of the hour, which was of so little consequence as a dinner at the Hobbses. Miss West must have for gotten how desirable she had found it to contrast the dignified modesty of attire exhibited by the daughter of Sir Randal Beauehamp, and her dame de compagnie, with the lavishness of outward beauty and perfection indulged in by the rich boilermaker's family, because that was all they had to fall back upon as their claim to a place in circles which they had no ancestral right to enter. \u25a0Constance supposed that Miss West must be concerned about her (Constance's) dress simply to do honour to 'Sir John, because she was to be his companion at the dinner at Kingsmeadows. Poor Mss West, though she was a thorough gentle -woman in feeling, and, as she believed, well-informed \"with regard to what ought to be a young gentlewoman's environment, was, like many elderly7 people, considerably ibehind her day. When she summoned Constance to make an examination of the contents of the late Lady Beau champ's jewel box, and of such articles of her wardrobe as had likewise been religiously preserved for her daughter, Miss West knew as little as Constance \u2014 which was saying a great deal \u2014 of what was convertible to the girl's use, or suitable for a neighbouring country-house dinner. Lady Beauchamp, during her brief reign, had revelled in gorgeous materials and gay colours, so gay in their sky-blues and rose-pinks that even such novices as were now turning the relics over with due respect, and the more or less of tender awe with which tender souls treat the possessions of the dead, recoiled a little from the robust hues of the old finery. These had been in fashion just before tints were softened and modified by a revolution in taste, which had educated Miss West's and Constance's eyes, without consciousness on their part, to \" grey greens \" and \"green greys,\" peacock blues, old gold colour, and old coral, to cool brown holland, and"], [180, "168 A MORNING MIST. still cooler white. Even Lady Beauchamp's jewelled necklets, bracelets and rings \u2014 a salvage from the wreck \u2014 which had not been reset for her, but had figured, as they were, on the neck, arms, and hands of her pre decessor, and even of her predecessor, Sir Randal's mother, were in the staring, heavy style which charac terised much of the goldsmith's work of fifty or sixty years ago. \" Oh dear ! I am afraid I shall be ridiculously fine,\" said Constance, with a true instinct, looking dubiously at the palest of the blue satins, and at the fragments of a set of topazes, as much marred by atrocious treatment as topazes could be. Miss West somehow fancied the satin and the topazes ought to go together, from a dim recollection she had retained of seeing Lady Beauchamp wearing both. \" Old brocades, like old lace, are often handed down through several generations,\" said Miss West, vaguely, seeking to reassure herself and Constance as she looked at the satin, which had nothing to recommend it save its extreme thickness and gloss, and the fact that it had not been soiled by much wear ; \" I remember, in my first situation, w7hen I weut to be governess to Miss Henniker, of Graystone, she had cousins, of very good family, who came to grace her birthday-ball in brocades which had belonged to their great-grandmother. It was just about the time when there was a rage for Dolly Varden cos tumes and Pompadour ribands.\" \" I don't know about my great-grandmother,\" said Constance, in her clear, sweet voice ; \" but I am sure I am proud and pleased to wear anything my poor dear mother wore. I think all the faint impressions I have of her are in gay, shining gowns like these, with spark ling things at her throat and wrists ; I daresay everybody in her rank dressed in that fashion then. But are you sure everything here is mine ? \" she inquired, anxiously, looking at the clumsy topazes. \" You know the family jewels ought to be John's, to keep for his wife, and her son's wife after her.\" \"I don't think these ornaments are of so much value"], [181, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.\" 169 as that, my dear,\" said Miss West, quickly, \" else they could not have been saved. All the real treasures of the house, as well as the estates, have gone to the hammer \u2014 you know your father died a poor man.\" \" Yes, I am sorry for John, as I used to be sorry for papa. But if all mamma's things were not any prettier than these,\" continued Constance, with more common sense and less of sentiment than might have been ex pected, \" I, for one, cannot regret the loss of the rest of them. But, Miss West, the fewer and poorer the things left, the more we are bound, in one sense, to look after my brother's title to them.\" \"Why, what would he do with them?\" inquired Miss West, a little impatiently. \"He has no wife to give them to \u2014 he may never have a wife.\" \" Oh, yes ! John must marry,\" declared Constance, in happy confidence, \" to hand on the title, and keep up the line.\" \" There are some other questions, besides those you mention, to be thought of in marriage,\" said Miss West, a little dryly. \" It is sufficient that Sir John has made no claim to the jewels. They were certainly your mother's. They were given to her, whether or not they were bought for her in the first place, or got up for her wearing, they were hers, and they should be yours. I have no doubt the first Lady Beauchamp carried off what she could call hers \u2014 I mean, of course, her family would see they were laid aside for her son,\" she corrected herself, stammering over the slip she had made. \" My dear,\" resumed Miss West, earnestly and anxiously, \" Sir John is very good. No brother could have behaved better, I have not a fault to find with him. But you must think of yourself in what concerns you both. You must keep what you can that is your own ; I am sure he would not wish you to do otherwise.\" Constance was a little puzzled and vexed by what appeared to her Miss West's uncalled-for recommenda tion, but she had too many things to think of to let it sink into her mind. The principal dressmaker in Dorrington was Miss"], [182, "170 A MORNING MIST. West's further confidante and referee in dressing Miss Beauchamp for going into company, even if it were no greater company than she would be likely to meet at Kingsmeadows. In the innocence of Miss West's heart, she was unaware that even the best of country-town dress makers is no longer of much avail in such consultations, though this one had heard that \"low necks\" were no longer demanded even from the younger dinner-guests\u2014 a piece of information which filled Miss West with con sternation. What had she been doing all these years ? She had got Constance's black and white frocks provided each with a couple of bodices. She had been satisfied from her early experience that a girl who was bound to dress for the evening had but to substitute a low for a high bodice, if her gown or frock happened to be of some economical white washing material, or black gauzy stuff ; perhaps, put on a girlish chain and locket to set off her round white throat, and do her hair afresh, to be quite well enough dressed for home wear. There was nothing in worse taste than over-dressing. \" Dear me ! \" Miss West had exclaimed in exasperation, on hearing the fiat against low necks and short sleeves at dinner, \"I am sure people have been going to church and everywhere in positively indelicately short sleeves. Why in the name of wonder should girls be told not to bare their necks and arms in heated rooms of an evening ? Long gloves are but a poor resource for sleeves in a walking costume.\" \"Madam,\" said the worthy dressmaker, slightly offended by the remonstrance, and using the form of address which only survives in palaces, shops, and show rooms, \" when I said low bodices and short sleeves were out for dinner dress, even in the case of young ladies, I did not mean that sleeves down to the wrist, and bodices close up to the chin (apart from the Medici collar), had taken their place. If you have a fancy for low bodices and sleeves, I wish you could see some of our ball dresses, which have no sleeves at all.\" \"It is modesty and moderation which I desire in dress, as in everything else,\" said Miss West, severely."], [183, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.\" 171 So Constance appeared, on her first introduction into \u25a0society, in the incongruous splendour of a twenty-years old satin, made with the anxious elaboration of a too conscientious country dressmaker, and topazes which, 'by dint of their setting, had the air of mock Cairngorms in the shoulder-brooches of fictitious Highland chiefs. Happily, it was not easy to vulgarise her slender figure and delicate, flower-like face. Moreover, the entire absence of any outward consciousness, in the middle of her inward shyness, and her fine, old-world habit of holding dress in comparatively slight esteem, would have carried off even worse than blue satin and topazes. She walked in them exactly as if they were her brown holland, or white muslin, or black barege and her simple silver bangles. Yet she turned round to show herself back and front to Miss West, with an artlessness that was irre sistible. \" I am afraid I am only too smart,\" she said, cheerfully ; \"but, oh dear ! what does it signify whether it is a wee bit too much or too little, especially when one cannot dress to perfection like Miss Hobbs ? As a rule, it is not a great matter what a girl wears, is it, if she dresses according to her station and is like her neighbours? Only I hope John will like my dress.\" \"You cannot be too smart for the Hobbses; indeed, a little extra smartness may be necessary to keep your proper place with them. It will all go down with them,\" said Miss West, emphatically, and with a con fidence which showed that, clever woman as she was, she could neither gauge the merits and demerits of the Hobbses, nor weigh properly the different degrees and kinds of smartness. \" I hope you like my frock, Johu,\" said Constance, almost timidly appealing to her brother, as he stood looking at her with a half pleased, half perplexed air, while the two waited for the hired fly which was to take them to Kingsmeadows, since Thomas and the pony-carriage were hors de combat here. Sir John was tickled by being constituted an authority on women's dress. \" Well, it seems very grand, but I am afraid I know little about it. However, there"], [184, "172 A MORNING MIST. is one thing I can say,\" he added quickly, noticing his sister's sensitive face fall, \"you look very nice in it, Connie.\" Constance was in the seventh heaven instantly. She was ready to follow his lead implicitly in everything. When he told her presently that the custom of Miss West's day, when a lady and gentleman walked arm-in arm into a room full of company, was no longer in opera tion, but that he would wait for her in the ante-room, and be ready to follow her when she came from the cloak-room, she caught up her gloves, and the Spanish fan Miss West had lent her, and said there was no need for her to keep him waiting, a servant could take her wrap. She was prepared to face without shrinking the ordeal of walking first into the room, secure in the know ledge that Sir John was half a foot behind her. For a second Constance's ey7es were dazzled, coming out of the summer twilight into the blaze of the wax lights of the drawing-room. To her unaccustomed eyes, it was full of dazzling brightness, and the room was crowded with company. She advanced bravely, never theless, with all the courage of all the Beauchamps, as she would have encountered a trial of any description with her hero to back her. In a few minutes she re- covered her composure, and was able to notice that Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs, who had just received her, were quite what she w7ould have expected them to be. He, a great deal too solemn for the occasion, and at the same time with a certain absent-minded air ; she, all alive in her sharpness, and as if she could jog her partner's elbow with satisfaction. She had still that general look of having had a yard or two abstracted and saved from her grey moire gown. For a moment or two, Mattie Hcbbs and her brother could not disengage themselves from the people to whom they were talking, so as to claim Constance as an old acquaintance, and she was free to take brief notes of the rest of the company. The beauty of the room and its accessories did not distract and engross her as when she saw them formerly. She felt more of an actor in the"], [185, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.\" 173 scene, with sufficient to occupy her in trying to behave so as not to do discredit to her brother. When her eyes got used to the scene, she found that there was no crowd. There were a few of the neigh bours who had lately made advances to her, or whom she knew by sight, and she was half surprised, half glad for Sir John's sake, that it was some of the best society in the county \u2014 as she had heard \u2014 who were present. It was condescension enough on her brother's part to come and dine among all these lovely shapes and colours, and feast on such good things as were Dives' daily fare ; it would have been too bad if Dives had not been able to find him better company than the Rev. Cyril Parry and Dr. Mason. It was well known they were bound by theirvocations to appear at all the dinner and tea tables of the better-to-do farmers in the parish. It would have been equally objectionable if Mr. Hobbs had taken it upou him to put off Sir John Beauchamp with the scraps and parings of the county circle, just because Sir John had lost Fairfields, and was so good as to spend his leave living quietly with his obliged and adoring sister at Maisonette. But who would have expected to meet the Willoughbys of Stenhouse and Lady Theresa Langton at the Hobbses' ? If Constance had only known it, Lady Theresa, after putting up her polished white back at the rebuff which Mrs. Hobbs had been forced in self-defence to administer to her, had calmly put down her back, and invited her self to Kingsmeadows to meet the Beauchamps. \"I believe you know the Beauchamp girl ? I wish you would ask us to meet her, both the brother and sister, Mrs. Hobbs, dear, that I may see whether I can take her up.\" Mrs. Hobbs had it on the tip of her tongue to say, \" I'll do nothing of the kind, my lady. If me and my daughter think Miss Beauchamp good enough company for ourselves, not to say you, then you might have the trust in us, and the common civility, to act as if she were good enough for you. You might guess that we would not see much sense in trotting her out, so as"], [186, "174 A MORNING MIST. you might settle whether her pace would suit yours or not.\" But Mrs. Hobbs was hospitable, and she had learnt just so much savoir vivre as not to make the speech which was on the tip of her tongue. She substituted for it a blunt \"I should be happy to oblige your ladyship, but I ain't at all sure that my husband can spare time for dinners just now.\" And when Mattie said Lady Theresa was an arrogant goose, still it might be doing an injury to Constance Beauchamp, in her position, to keep the great lady of the neighbourhood from seeing what a little lady Constance was, and so acknowledging her along with her brother, Mrs. Hobbs gave way entirely. \" I don't want to do the girl an injury, but it riles me to hear you call her a ' little lady,' Martha Hobbs ; she's none too little 'cept for being slim. And you'll keep Lady Theresa from beginning a-huggin' of me again in public. It ain't pretty behaviour to a woman like me in private, but it is a deal worse before folks ; I can't stand no more of it. It is enough for me to bear being ' deared ' by her as I never set eyes on till we came to Kings meadows, and as wouldn't know me from Eve if she were among her own set of lords and ladies and had any other fish to fry.\" There were one or two strangers \u2014 gentlemen \u2014 whom Constance did not know, while she had sufficient dis crimination to decide for herself that they were gentle men, not tradesmen. She was puzzled by the special attention and deference with which she could see, at a glance, that one of them was listened to, till she discov ered, later in the evening, from a morsel of confidential conversation which reached her, that he was a junior member of Her Majesty's Cabinet. To what was not boilermaking capable of attaining ? Constance's earlier speculations were put a stop to by her being greeted first by Mattie, and then by young Joe Hobbs, who remained at her elbow, talking in his quick, eager fashion, which somehow disconcerted and tired her. She could not follow his meaning fast enough. She had a vague comprehension that he did not see her"], [187, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST \"DINNER.\" 175 as she was, therefore he misunderstood her. He appealed to her sympathies and claimed her interest in the innumerable matters, especially the social questions, which engrossed him, of which she knew little, and, if possible, cared less. But for Miss Hobbs Constance had nothing save strong liking and wistful admiration. Mattie Hobbs looked quite plainly dressed to-night, as did most of the other ladies, Constance remarked to her dismay. Indeed, she had a notion that she and careworn little Mrs. Parry \u2014 who wore her wedding-dress, which had been handsome in its day, but was considerably out of date \u2014 were the most conspicuously \"fine\" of all the ladies in the room. What a blessing it was for Con stance that she laboured under an antediluvian delusion which, when it exists at all in this nineteenth century, is confined to rare examples of men \" out of the swim,\" in whose natures there are positively no elements which can constitute them, under whatever provocation, men-milliners ! Constance thought that a little less or even a little more finery did not matter. It was the woman who made the dress, and not the dress which made the woman. She could sit serenely, with an in definable air of refinement and distinction, in blue satin and topazes, the satin puckered and pleated, the topazes sunk and buried in their thick metal rims, which, though of good gold, had a solid, staring brassiness about them, and look at her sister-women, whom she called plainly dressed, in their light trailing silk and lace or crepe, draped with artistic carelessness, as if needle or pin had never penetrated the softly-falling folds. The colours were so studied and balanced that their com binations were too exquisite to catch and hold the untutored eye. An artistic education was required to appreciate them properly. And Constance called these costly, much-pondered-over costumes plain and simple, and brought them down to the level of common, conve nient wearing apparel ! Oh the depths of aristocratic maidenly ignorance, profound enough to match the heights of boilermaking attainments ! Incredible as"], [188, "176 A MORNING MIST. it may sound to some ears, Constance actually over looked the diamonds which hung like dew-drops, aud the pearls that were strung like daisies, and fancied that her topazes \u2014 which seemed as if they had begun by adorning candlesticks, the rims of which they had carried away with them when they went to fulfil another destiny \u2014 the most valuable jewels, the only jewels worth mentioning, in the room. Yet she had no innate lack of taste ; she, too, preferred simplicity, but she had not yet learnt to distinguish artificial from real simplicity, and to value the artificial in proportion to what it cost."], [189, "CHAPTER XV. i THE ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDED FOR A DEBUTANTE. Mattie told Constance, as a matter of course \u2014 \"You know father must take in Lady Theresa, Sir John is to have mother, and Joe is to be your partner. I do wish I could sit near you, but I am afraid I must go to the opposite side of the table, with Johnnie Rodney. Isn't it a shame to call him Johnnie, and he helping to govern the country ? But a particular friend of mine is a favourite cousin of his, and it was from her that Joe and I picked up the bad habit. Besides, doesn't he look like a Johnnie \u2014 a worthy, affable Johnnie ? I hope he -will forgive me if he ever finds me out, and return good for evil, since I am going to speak up to him for Joe's last pet fad \u2014 a Government grant worthy of the name for industrial schools and technical classes, to be opened in connection with the Board schools. You don't think it is taking advantage of Mr. Rodney7, to poke shop at him aud try to influence his opinions, when he is in my power, under father's roof? But when it comes to that,\" went on Mattie, with a gleam of satire in her bright, good humoured, dark eyes, \" though he is such a worthy and affable Johnnie, we are quite aware that he is not sitting at our table entirely for our sake. He wishes father's support in a Government measure, and I know he will get it, for father rather approves of it, though he is not on the Government side in politics.\" \"But Mr. Hobbs is not a Member of Parliament,\" said Constance, with bewildered hesitation. \" Oh, no ! \" replied Mattie, laughing. \" He has tco much to do with the foundry aud about the place here. 12"], [190, "178 A MORNING MIST. Did I speak as if father were a member ? But people can do a good deal to support measures, though they are not in the House. For instance, father is having Mr. Willoughby and Mr. Mervyn to meet Mr. Rodney, and hear him air his measure ; and he asked down Mr. Jessop, the little dark man talking to Mr. Willoughby. He is a rising barrister, and is to have the first seat his party can spare for him. If he were to become a convert \u2014 even a convert, late in the day \u2014 to Johnnie Rodney's views he would be a tower of strength in himself, for he speaks well, and has the confidence of his supporters.\" All that Mattie was saying with so much animation was Greek and Latin to Constance. What she did lay to heart, after her companion had to move off, was that the dinner had not been made entirely in Sir John's honour, as she had fondly supposed. She could also correct another mistake on her part. She had been so ignorant, and so heedless of what she had heard of the etiquette of dinners, that she had felt not merely sincere pity for her brother, but considerable annoyance, at his having to take in Mrs. Hobbs to dinner. As if a fitter partner could not have been found for him ! But Constance was quick enough to gather, from Mattie's talk, that the selection was at once arbitrary, like the assignment of Mr. Hobbs to Lady Theresa, and complimentary, like the arrangement which gave young Hobbs to herself \u2014 an arrangement with which she did not quarrel particularly. She rather liked him. He was Miss Hobbs's brother, and better than a stranger for a partner, though he would fidget and frown, and start queer topics, looking so terribly in earnest about them. When the couple were seated at table, and she was admiring the flowers, and wondering if it would be quite according to rule to ask if his sister had arranged them, and to inquire the names of those which were new to her, he turned those clear light grey eyes on her, as if he saw nobody else in the world, and asked her, as if it were a question on which his existence depended, what she thought of the co operative principle ? \"Co-operative?\" repeated Constance. \"There is a"], [191, "ENTERTAINMENT FOR A DEBUTANTE. 179 co-operative store in Dorrington,\" she went on, reduced to speaking her thoughts aloud, while she held a spoonful of soup in suspension. \" It is shop-keeping by a company instead of a person \u2014 is it not ? We don't buy things at the co-operative store ; Miss West does not think it fair to the old shop-keepsrs with whom we have always dealt.\" \" There is something in that,\" he said, frowning more fiercely than ever ; \" but then, don't you see ? the true meaning of co-operation is not to reduce the prices to the buyer, it is to give the employed a share in the profits of the employer \u2014 the benefits of their own skill and industry, as it were. It is to encourage them to be industrious, diligent and saving, with the prospect of their thus becoming small capitalists, and reaping the fruits of their investments.\" \"I suppose so,\" said Constance, doubtfully ; \"I am afraid I do not know much about it.\" \" You see if the co-operative principle does not work, does not do something to combat what is becoming the tremendous evil of over-competition, I cannot think of anything else to save us from being swamped, save wholesale emigration ; can you, Miss Beauchamp ? \" he demanded, fixing her with those wonderfully expressive pale eyes of his. \"Are we going to be swamped?\" asked Constance, incredulously. \" We have heard nothing of it at Maison ette. I, for one, should not like to emigrate, unless it were to go out to India to be near my brother.\" She made the amendment with an affectionate glance at Sir John, sitting at Mrs. Hobbs's right hand and bend ing courteously to listen to some of her extraordinary speeches \u2014 odder even than her son's. \"But though ladies go everywhere nowadays the idea never seems to have entered his head,\" she continued, with a quick little sigh, \" and I am afraid Miss West would not hear of it. She would not like to have to do with coolies and ayahs, punkahs and rattlesnakes.\" \" Probably not,\" said Joe Hobbs with the bright smile which showed his white teeth and contrasted"], [192, "180 A MORNING MIST. strongly with his short-sighted frown, \" but that is not the kind of emigration I referred to.\" \" Then I think I should prefer to co-operate, if there is no choice between that and being swamped,\" said Constance. \" That's right,\" he said with emphatic approval. \" But I have not the least notion w*hat I am to co-operate in,\" she confessed candidly. \" Perhaps time will show you,\" he muttered in an undertone. And she noticed, to her surprise, that his thin, brown face flushed hotly as he spoke, and that he renewed the conversation instantly, as if to obliterate any unusual impression his harmless-sounding speech might have made : \" Springhaven is all for emigration.\" \" And is he an authority on emigration ? \" inquired Constance, not caring much whether Springhaven were an authority or not, but creditably anxious to do herself, Sir John, and Miss West justice in maintaining her part of the tete-a-tete, though it was too much of a puzzle to be anything else than wearisome to her. She would far rather have been left to eat her dinner in peace and watch her neighbours, than be under the necessity of talking political economy or social science \u2014 which was it ? \u2014 that Miss West had not included in her system of education, with young Hobbs. \"Who \u2014 Springhaven?\" he looked perplexed in his turn; \"he is Lord Erith's eldest son, you know, so, though he has travelled a good deal, he has had no practical experience of emigration. His duties are at home, for Lord Erith is old and invalided.\" Constance was thinking here was another of her theories demolished. Like women in general she was apt to leap at conclusions. She had been setting it down in her mind, as the next thing to an established fact, that it was because Joe Hobbs was a boiler-maker's son, that he was full of the masses, and their wants. She had heard his father spoken of as a philanthropist \u2014 not like John Howard, spending his life in visiting prisons, or glorious Gordon riding his camel through the sandy desert to put down the African slave-trade \u2014 but at his"], [193, "ENTERTAINMENT FOR A DEBUTANTE. 181 ease, between attending to his own affairs, and making larger and larger heaps of money, with every comfort amidst the luxuries and charms of Kingsmeadows. Was the disease infectious ? Did it attack tradesmen and their offspring specially ? Sir John had been a number of weeks at home, yet she had never heard him allude to co-operative societies, or mention the great unwashed at all, unless he was reading of them in a paragraph from the newspapers. She was inclined to think that he had enough to do with himself, that it was sufficient for a gentleman \u2014 as it was for a lady \u2014 to do his duty, and afford a good example to his inferiors. Surely the masses \u2014 who had all the advantage of numbers, from whom no great things were expected, who had no high obligations binding on them\u2014 might be left to look after themselves ! Really it was greatly more respectful to them to treat them as if they could, especially after the Board schools were supplying them with education. Yet here was a Lord Erith's son \u2014 who could never try emigration on his own account, she was told \u2014 as full of it as young Mr. Hobbs was of co-operation. There, he was beginning about it again ! \" Mattie thinks the allotment system might be enlarged and extended, so as to become land co-operation on a considerable scale,\" resumed Joe Hobbs. \" Of course it has been tried in different forms with various results.\" \" I have heard that peasant proprietorship does not always answer,\" said Constance, with a spice of malice, glibly availing herself of a glimmering recollection she had of some magazine article which she had read. \" But how clever and strong-minded Miss Hobbs must be to master such details.\" \" You are laughing at me, Miss Beauchamp,\" said Joe Hobbs, with frank penitence, \"and I deserve it, for I am boring you. I have a bad habit of imagining that every body else is interested in what interests me immensely, and as you belong to the neighbourhood and have to do with the country-people about, I thought But of course, it is not the same thing where a young lady is concerned.\""], [194, "182 A MORNING MIST. \" It does not seem to make any difference with your sister,\" asserted Constance. \" And if personal remarks are allowed, I will maintain that she must be clever and strong-minded to understand political economy.\" \" I don't call this political economy,\" said Joe Hobbs, with another of his bright smiles and accompanying frowns. \" As for Mattie, oh, yes, she is clever enough, she is always catching me up \u2014 especially when she reads the same book. But I should not say that she was particularly strong-minded. She has a good many weak points.\" \" It is very ungrateful of you to say so,\" said Constance, indignantly zealous in the cause of another woman, \" when she is at this moment pleading in the interest of one of your hobbies to Mr. Rodney. She told me she was going to do it,\" and she glanced down the table, on the opposite side of which Mattie was seated, speaking earnestly to her attentive companion. \" Then I hope she will not put her foot into it,\" he said, bluntly \u2014 brother-like, ignoring the gratitude due from him, and showing a tendency to undervalue a sister's services. \" Special pleading won't do here. Mattie is apt to be a special pleader \u2014 indeed, so are all women, if you will forgive me for saying so.\" \"I don't mind,\" said Constance, carelessly, with her thoughts evidently wandering. Her whole manner smote him with the conviction that, while he was bent on winning her good opinion, he was neither interesting nor entertaining her, and she was too sincere and simple to pretend to be interested or entertained. \"Have you any feeling for cricket?\" \u2014 he made another attempt to get her on his side. \"I don't know about feeling,\" she replied, truthfully. \" I like to watch the game. I always make Thomas stop the phaeton if we have a little time to spare, aud he is driving past the Common when a match is going on.\" ' ' Then I am sure you will agree with me when I tell what is one of Mattie's weak points. We were starting for a great school treat at Rivermeadows on the day Sir John was over. Mattie was undertaking the girls and"], [195, "ENTERTAINMENT FOR A DEBUTANTE. 183 the smaller boys, and I had weakly agreed to marshal the bigger boys for a cricket-match against the boys of Church Abdy. Weakly, I say advisedly, since Mattie was raging for amusement for her small boys. There was not room on the ground for two matches, and she would have spoilt the only one which was possible, if she had got her way, by introducing the younger boys to play \u25a0by detachments, on either side.\" \" It was very good of her,\" said Constance, looking him in the face, at the same moment giving a sign of refusal to a servant who was offering her an entree. She spoke so absently, that he gave his moustache a despair ing tug, and turned to his neighbour on the other hand, whom he had too long neglected, letting Constance alone, to her relief, for the next five minutes. \" She has neither eyes nor ears for anybody save that precious brother of hers,\" Joe Hobbs told himself. \" Her .attention is constantly wandering to him ; for it cannot be the attractions of the Mater which are fascinating her.\" He appeared to be attending to his neighbour on the left, while he drifted along on an undercurrent of exaggerated sentiment of all kinds, sprouting jeal ousy, self-blame, &c, &c. \"If I had not been a con summate ass,\" he reflected, bitterly, \" I might, by a very simple process, have engaged her to her heart's content and never had her heavenly eyes off my face. I had only to talk of Sir John, though what to say of him during all the courses of a dinner I cannot cudgel my brains to dis cover. His exploits are nil, as far as I have heard. He is an Adonis of thirty, with a handle to his name, no doubt ; but he is also a dull, well-disposed, self -engrossed, figure-head of an officer, whose life is one dreary round of self-suppression, for which I am heartily sorry, but the beggar has himself to thank for it. Why did he go into a profession for which he had no particular capacity, else he would have been a different man, with different prospects by this date? Why did he embrace genteel poverty, knowing, as he ought to have known, that it was not likely to afford him a solitary outlet to retrieve his fortunes, and better his condition ? His single chance"], [196, "184 A MORNING MIST. would be in consenting to the supreme degradation of putting himself and his title up to auction in the mar riage-market, and I believe this girl's brother is too much of a gentleman at heart, is too honest and kindly in his slowness and stolidity, to consent to that till he is at his last gasp.\" In the meantime Constance caught at the opportunity granted to her, not to turn to her next neighbour, but to study covertly how her beloved Sir John w*as getting on, whether he ate at the rich man's table with more appe tite than he was able to get up for the simple fare of Maisonette, what dishes he preferred, so that she might try, if it were possible, to give Miss West and the cook a hint to supply them at any sacrifice, in order to tempt his jaded palate. She wondered whether he was finding Mrs. Hobbs as \" taking \" as he had prophesied she would be in society. He must have assisted at many dinners of the kind, for he treated everything as a matter of course. He helped himself to two dishes handed to him, which both looked mysterious to Constance, whose names iu the menu did not enlighten her, so that she was afraid she could not instruct the Maisonette cook as to their contents. Sir John, when condescending to figure at rich men's feasts, must also have sometimes sat by matrons as unsophisticated and unconventional, in speech and behaviour, as was his present hostess, for Constance's critical eye could uot detect the slightest change in his countenance \u2014 not the flicker of an eyelid at her \" ain'ts \" or misapplied h's. When he smiled, which was not infrequently, it was a smile of pure contentment, as if he were very well occupied and amused. Sir John must be finding Mrs. Hobbs's homespun wit as agreeable and diverting as he had declared it would be to the great world in general. When the ladies repaired to the drawing-room, Mrs. Hobbs at once pounced on Lady Theresa and Mrs. Parry, and seated them accordingto their hostess's sense of what was right. \"It ain't fit for you, after your bad"], [197, "ENTERTAINMENT FOR A DEBUTANTE. 185 cold the other week, to sit by that window, Mrs. Parry. My lady, if you want to speak to Mrs. Parry, you must change sides ; you are a strong young woman, and you don't mind the air, as I know.\" \" Oh, you de-li-cious Mrs. Hobbs ! \" cried Lady Theresa, with aristocratic effrontery ; \" you take such good care of us all.\" \" I'd need to,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, in her curt est way, \" for there are some of you as can't take care of your selves. Besides, I don't know what old women are good for if it bean't to look after the young ones.\" \" But nobody grows old, nowadays,\" protested her ladyship, laughing, \" except yourself, dear Mrs. Hobbs, which makes it the more refreshing, you nice, quaint old thing ! Yet it is a fiction all the same, and you expect us to say you look younger than any of us \u2014 you know you do.\" \" I know nothing of the sort,\" said Mrs, Hobbs, indig nantly, as she pulled forward her pretty lace cap over her still abundant dark hair ; I should be a bigger fool than any of you if I did ; and that would be worser than being called 'a thing ' \u2014 as I don't make believe to like.\" \" But, my dear Mrs. Hobbs, everyone uses the expres sion in connection with old \u2014 no, I mean with ladies who are no longer young exactly,\" remonstrated Lady Theresa, having the grace to colour a little. \"The more shame to everyone,\" maintained Mrs. Hobbs, stoutly. \" How would you like being called ' a flighty young creature '\u2014as is just what you are, though you are a married woman of several years' standing? \" \" Oh, Mrs. Hcbbs ! ' a creature ' ? \" cried Lady Theresa, throwing up her white hands in affected horror. \" Yes, ma'am, a creature,\" repeated Mrs. Hobbs, doggedly. \" Ain't we all creatures rather than things? I can make a thing, but never a creature, as is the work of the Great Creator \u2014 so Catechism have told me.\" \"How solemn we are!\" exclaimed Lady Theresa, half under her breath, as if in an awed whisper. \" I'm bound to be solemn,\" insisted Mrs. Hobbs. c< I'll never see fifty-four again \u2022 and as my master is six years"], [198, "186 A MORNING MIST. older, what should I want to look younger than my age for ? What would be the use of affronting he by pretend ing as he had wed a lass young enough to be his daughter? \" \" Oh ! we are not all so considerate of the feelings of our lords,\" said Lady Theresa, shaking her head in mock contrition, thus reminding her companions that she had married a man old enough to be her father \u2014 a reminder which, to do Mrs. Hobbs justice, put her about consider ably. \" I thought you were over there, Lady Theresa,\" said Mattie, gaily. She was bringing forward a portfolio of sketches at her guest's request, and stopped, surprised by the fact that the lady who was \"dying to see the sketches,\" and Mrs. Parry had changed seats. \" I was not allowed to keep my chair, Miss Hobbs,\" explained her ladyship, with the demure meekness of a schoolgirl. \" Never mind, Martha Hobbs \u2014 I done it,\" Mrs. Hobbs told her daughter ; and the earth did not open and swallowup the speakerfor murdering syntax. On the other hand, she was still troubled by the former blunder she had committed, for as to making a malicious insinuation for the purpose of wounding another person's feelings \u2014 in her own house, above all \u2014 Mrs. Hobbs was as incapable of it as she was of highly polished language and behaviour. But the wonder to Constance was that nobody, not even Mattie, minded Mrs. Hobbs's dreadful solecisms. \"Oh, it was your doing, mother!\" The daughter accepted the situation cheerfully. \" Yes, Lady Theresa, we have all to do as mother bids us here,\" she added, with a merry twinkle in her eyes ; \" but if you are not quite comfortable there, I am sure she will listen to reason, and let you sit elsewhere.\" It seemed as if nobody cared for correct language, and a suave demeanour, or if they cared for them it was only to show how enlivening it was to meet their opposites once upon a time. Lady Theresa had gained her object of inspecting"], [199, "ENTERTAINMENT FOR A DEBUTANTE. 187 Constance from a safe distance, before making direct advances to her. Then the w*him took the lady \u2014 whose chief object in life, at the present stage in her develop ment, was to gratify her whims \u2014 to fall violently in love with the girl. \" She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ; where has she hidden herself till now ? How proud Sir John must be of her ! Sir John is very well for a man, but his sister is adorable. I think I have heard that the mauvais sujet, their father, was a fine looking man in his day, and I suppose Miss Beauchamp's mothermust have been some romantically beautiful village maid, the rose or lily of her native place, in the old hackneyed phraseology. If she was only half as beauti ful as her charming daughter, the villain of the piece, Sir Randal, might have been forgiven any enormity.\" Lady Theresa was a beauty herself, and so inclined to exalt the power of beauty. She was also a handsome brunette ; thus she could afford to enlarge on the fascina tions of a fair blonde. \"Father says Miss Beauchamp's mother was the prettier of the two,\" said Mattie, incautiously. \"Your father knew her mother? How charming!\" professed Lady Theresa, softly. \"Whatabond of union!\" And she opened wide a pair of interested, inquisitive black eyes. ' ' He did not know her after she was Lady Beauchamp \u2014 he only knew her when she was a girl,\" Mattie hastened to say7, fearing that she had made an unwise assertion, and seeking to turn the conversation back to its starting-point. \" Perhaps distance lends enchant ment to the view, or difference of dress and surroundings may be at the root of the preference. I think, with you, that Constance Beauchamp is pretty enough for any thing ; and I believe I shall find her as nice as I expect when I know her better. She has been very well brought up by Miss West, the lady who stays with her at Maisonette ; she has not gone into society before, so that she is naturally shy. She looks still prettier in her Quaker-brown holland than she looks in that dress.\" \" That dress ! \" exclaimed Lady Theresa, innocently,"], [200, "188 A MORNING MIST. looking Mattie full in the face. \" Don't you think it very smart? How cheering it is to find that the nice, bright colours and the old, undisguised, unadorned materials \u2014 the satins that were like leather for thickness, and the silks which would have stood alone in their stiffness \u2014 are coming in again ! And what a treasure of a dressmaker Miss Beauchamp must possess; I am sure the woman must have laboured days and nights at that frock, and that it would take days and nights to pick it to pieces. How different from our flimsy arrangements, put together by sleight of hand, and kept in their place by magic ! I cannot say that I quite like the jewels,\" added Lady Theresa, more naturally. ' ' What are they ? Cairn gorms? bits of orange- coloured glass dabbed into bar baric lumps of gold ? Topazes, do you think ? Really ? Then they are in vilest setting, with an atrocious accompaniment, so far as a blue satin frock is concerned. If Sir John can do no better than that for his sister out of the family strong-box, she ought to be forbidden trinkets.\""], [201, "CHAPTER XVI. THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY FOR THE HUNT BALL. It was at the dinner at Kingsmeadows that Constance first heard of the still more intoxicating experience in store for her in a ball, her first ball, when she would really come out, under her brother's wing. Lady Theresa and Mattie Hobbs referred in their con versation to a Hunt Ball, which was occuring out of its natural season, a death in the family of the M. F. H. at the close of the hunting season, having deferred the cus tomary festivity. A sufficient time had elapsed to allow the ball to be held, and the whole neighbourhood seemed prepared to attend it as a matter of course. \" You will go to the ball, Miss Beauchamp? \" said Lady Theresa, in her most persuasive accents. \" If it is your coming-out ball, it will be a feather in its cap, something to remember it by. No girl has had the good sense to come out at any of our Hunt Balls in my day. They always transfer such events to London, cramming every good thing into their first season in town. \" I tell them,\" continued her ladyship, in the tone of a venerable matron, \" it is waste ful, unpatriotic, a slight to their county and their Hunt. Oh, yes ! I did it myself, I confess, but then we were so many girls that we had to be brought out in batches, and it was more convenient to do it along with our presenta tion in town. But mamma came out at a hunt ball, and it was there that papa saw her first. I daresay he would never have noticed her if they had met at a great crush in London after Easter.\" \" There is an inducement ! \" said Mattie Hobbs, comically. \" What would we not do to escape being overlooked ? \""], [202, "190 A MORNING MIST. \"There is no fear of your being overlooked,\" said Lady Theresa, with a meaning nod, which Mit tie took to apply to her father's colossal fortune and her prospec tive share in it \u2014 rather a sore point with her, in spite of her sense, when it clashed with her capacity to win friends, and make her way in the world. \"Neither is Miss Beauchamp in any great danger of being lost sight of in the rank and file of young ladies,\" went on Lady Theresa. \" You will do us the honour to appear at our ball ? \" she turned to Constance with a pretty, coaxing air. \" Not an honour,\" stammered Constance, a little pub out in her simple pride by this lavish homage from the great lady of whom she knew so little; \"I should like to go very much indeed, but I don't know what my brother will say,\" with a shy glance of appeal to him, \" or what Miss West may think.\" \" It rests with you and Miss West,\" said Sir John. \" I shall be happy to do my part in seeing you through the ball.\" And Constance felt raised mountains high in the company's estimation by Sir John's consideration and indulgence. But the irony of fate was still at work, for just as Constance's first realization of dining out, in company with her brother, was at Kingsmeadows, so she was destined to go to her coming-out ball as one of the Kings meadows party, actually under the chaperonage of Mrs. Hobbs. Constance, as well as Miss West, had got so far reconciled to admitting a neighbourly equality on the part of the boiler-maker's family by Sir John's cool advocacy of their claims, and by being forced to see the terms on which they stood with the county peo ple around, who were just beginning to accept Constance as an otherwise indisposable adjunct of Sir John's.. Still this was different from freely consenting that Con stance and Sir John should go over to stay the night at Kingsmeadows, in order to accompany Mrs. Hobbs and her party to the ball. Constance marvelled how Miss West was ever brought to agree to such an arrangements"], [203, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY 191 and attributed it solely to the influence of Sir John, who seemed somehow to have come to depend on the good offices of the Hobbses in a manner which was unfathom- able to his sister, considering the light in which she saw their respective relations. She did not make allowance for the manner in which he took matters as he found them, and for the half-despairing supineness which had stolen over and taken possession of the man. Of course, Kingsmeadows was one of the nearest county houses to Maisonette, and enjoyed affluence in every desirable attribute, including an excellent stud, good shooting and fishing, and a good table. Then there was the compara- tive indifference of its masters to what loomed most largely in the eyes of county gentlemen in general, together with the father and son's numerous engagements at their foundry and office, on their boards, councils, and committees, to which the pair were specially addicted. No men among Sir John's recent acquaintance were so liberal and friendly as the Hobbses were, in remembering that he was making a stay at what was purely a lady's house, and a lady's house of limited resources, and in putting within his reach the occupations and amusements which might be supposed acceptable to a young man of his position and profession. Within the two weeks which elapsed between the dinner at Kingsmeadows and the Hunt Ball, Sir John made use of agreeable alternatives to the lessons he was giving his sister in driving and sketching, and to their walks and archery practice. He varied them by the mounts he accepted from Joe Hobbs, and the days he went shooting and fishing with the Kings- meadows keepers when their masters were otherwise engaged. Indeed, Sir John appeared to take kindly, in his quiet way, to the whole family. He talked art \u2014 on which he had more to say, and said it better, than on most subjects \u2014 with Mattie Hobbs, and went on occasional sketching expeditions, in which she as well as Constance figured. He persisted in declaring that Mrs. Hobbs was one of the most entertaining, as he was satisfied that she was one of the most sterling women"], [204, "192 A MORNING MIST. he had ever come across. He repeated, with languid enthusiasm, that old Hobbs was one of the men who were honours to their country, and whom their country did well to honour in return, as pillars and backbones, and \" all that sort of thing, don't you know ? \" of the State and community. As for young Hobbs, he was Sir John's fidus Achates for the moment \u2014 his temporary chum, though never were worthy chums more unlike ; a very good fellow in his crotchets, and uncommonly free with his mounts, his guns, and his fishing-tackle. In honour bound Sir John would not hear a word said against Joe Hobbs. It was Mattie Hobbs who planned that the Beau champs should be in her mother's party at the Hunt Ball, returning and spsnding what was left of the night at Kingsmeadows. Miss West could not go to a ball, where she would be decidedly out of place, and all the quiet routine of Maisonette would be upset by any other arrangement. \" I don't care a bit for balls, and I defy you to say as I am a woman that is in her proper place at them. But as for me and the order of Kingsmeadows, as is like to be turned topsy-turvy by them gay doings, in course that don't matter,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, sardonically, as she and Mattie were alone one morning in the breakfast-room. For a wonder, Mrs. Hobbs was idle. She was sitting with her fingers interlaced and her locked hands resting on the table before her, in a way she had when she did happen not to be employed. Mattie had a pencil and card in her hand, and was rapidly making some notes. She looked at her mother in merry remonstrance and full confidence. \" Now, mother, you know, it is different with you,\" she said. \" It is one of your obligations to go into society when you have such a man as father for your husband. You observe I am putting out of sight the claims of your daughter, but when did you set her the example of fail ing father and neglecting your obligations ? Poor Miss West has neither husband, nor chick, nor child, to whom she is accountable.\""], [205, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 193 \" A deal the happier woman she.\" \" You know you don't think so ; you are only the least bit in the world ' riled ' and grumpy. Never mind, mother, the ball will soon be over, and you will be at peace again among the children, your beloved cocks and hens and cows, and your indebted clients, Mrs. Parry and those I bring you from Rivermeadows.\" \" Humph ! it is cutting their throats all the same, Mrs. Parry's amongst the rest. But though I own I'm a weak fool, it do come hard on me that I should have to go to hops iu my age \u2014 I as were never a one for trapesing and gadding, not to say dancing, when I were young, or I would not have been your father's choice, I can tell you that, Mattie.\" \" I daresay not ; but having been his choice, and one in a thousand to him, you are not going to leave him and his family in the lurch? He is a member of the Hunt, and so is Joe, though even he does not put in an appear ance in the field often enough to satisfy the county. They ought to grant us a little licence, because we are not come of people who had it in their power to take to sport and play as the business of life. We are come of working-people, and we'll assert our right to be working people for another generation or two. Perhaps by that time everybody will work, as the Queen on the throne and many a true lady and gentleman of long descent work, for the dignity and joy of the thing. Besides, you don't know what mischief I might get into if you were not by?\" \" Get away with you, Martha Hobbs ! \" said her mother, with a derisive flash in the dark eyes which were so like the other eyes laughing out to meet hers. \" If you ain't able to take care of yourself by now, and you a woman grown, as has seen the world, it ain't me as will waste my breath looking after you.\" \" Milly Hatherley and Clara Fenton will be here,\" said Mattie, insinuatingly. \" Balls don't come much in their way, poor dears, since both their fathers had such losses, so that you would not deprive them of the chance of one more of them ; and I daresay their brothers will like to 13"], [206, "194 A MORNING MIST. run down from town when the girls are here. One or two people more or less won't put you about. That is the good of a big place like this.\" \" Go on,\" chimed in Mrs. Hobbs, ironically, \" invite all and sundry, and let Joe bring over a pack of his friends \u2014 Lord Springhaven and the like, as is accus tomed to attend the Court balls, and to dine with the Queen, when her has room for him, and can be troubled with his company ; or some of them newspaper lads, as are out of elbows, with the soles and uppers of their boots a-parting company. It is lucky your father has a broad back, and Kingsmeadows is a roomy house, as you say. Don't go for to think as he and I grudge your friends their victuals.\" \" I know you don't, or your own bother with them,\" said Mattie, heartily ; \" and it is not your blame if everybody is not comfortable and happy.\" \" I ain't so fond of butter,\" retorted Mrs. Hobbs, with a disdainful sniff, \" as to swallow it without e'er a bit of bread to make it go down.\" \" I have set my heart on everything going off well where the Beauchamps are concerned,\" admitted Mattie, candidly ; \" and I distrust Lady Theresa. She may be a good friend to Constance Beauchamp in her peculiar position, or my lady may simply make game of the poor girl, according to the humour of the moment. I did not like the way in which Lady Theresa went into ecstasies over that ridiculous gown. It show7s how very, very pretty and refined my little lady is that she could stand it so well.\" \" She's well enough in a pink-and- white-doll way. She ain't my purchase,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with cutting indifference. \" A fiasco like that will not happen again,\" said Mattie, pursuing the even tenor of her thoughts, and speaking with modest pride. \" I don't know that I am a great authority on dress ; I suspect I am a good deal indebted to our employing a good dressmaker. Why should I call her a modiste any more than animadvert on tailor-made gowms, or talk of ' building ' a figure \u2014 or"], [207, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 195 a pair of corsets ? But our dressmaker knows her business, and her customer's requirements. And, after all, I don't think that I could make such a sw7ell of myself as poor Constance consented to be made the other night. I suppose I have been too much about in the world to fall into such an error. However, I have contrived that Constance shall not be ' a guy ' at the ball. I have stolen a march on Lady Theresa. When I called yesterday at Maisonette, Miss West paid me the comphment of consulting me on Miss Beauchamp's dress for the Hunt Ball. I don't know whether she suspected that there was anything w*rong about the blue satin, but I could see she was anxious, poor soul ! not only as to the style of the ball dress, but as to its cost. Miss Constance must either have no control over her pocket money, or must manage it very badly.\" \" Very like,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with sardonic emphasis. \" I was glad to have it in my power to say that I believed Lady Theresa Langton had come to the con clusion that plain white frocks were the fit wear for all save elderly matrons at the ball, and had urged her opinion on the girls in her set. I am afraid she arrived at the decision because the Dunstables, of Whitemoat, whom she regards as third-rate people, and who are not much good, I must say, were so very fine at last year's ball. There was no need for me to tell Miss West that. I had only to quote the verdict of a leader of society that white muslin or mousseline de soi \u2014 what did it matter in the repetition ? \u2014 was to be the order of the day. I said, further, that if she cared to send a pattern frock of Miss Beauchamp's, it could go to Madame Mathilde, who was making mine, and she would let Miss Beauchamp have a dress at the same time, which would save trouble. I had to be very careful and diplomatic, I assure you, for what I really meant was something I dared not say to Miss West. I intended to give a hint to Madame Mathilde \u2014 I wish she had the sense to use her surname, or her proper Christian name, and drop that foolish ' Mathilde,' if her Christian name is Matilda,"], [208, "196 A MORNING MIST. which I should say is doubtful ; but I suppose it would not pay. Beggars cannot be choosers, and I am going to ask a favour from Madame. I wish her to make Miss Beauchamp's dress as nice, and charge her as little, as a dressmaker of standing can bring herself to do. She can put the difference into my account, as she did before, when she made yachting dresses for Milly and Clara.\" \" That was plain sailing,\" said Mrs. Hobbs. \" Their fathers were old acquaintances of father's, a step or two above him to begin with. Dick Hatherley \u2014 he were a half-pay cap'ain's son \u2014 and Fenton married one o' the Mildmays, when father was their manager, afore he was made a partner. After they saw how he got on, nothing would hinder them but they would have a try at trade, and they did well enough for a year or two, till luck took a turn, and not having father's headpiece they corned to grief, poor chaps ! Milly and Clara are girls as you've knowed all your life ; they were at school with you off and on for years, and barrin' that they ain't troubled with much thought and have idle idears in their heads \u2014 as you've helped to put there, I don't doubt \u2014 I've naught to say against they. It ain't hard to understand why you should do them what you fancy is a good turn ; but, Martha Hobbs, I'll make bold to ask you what call you have to serve them Beauchamp cattle ? \" Mattie paused and considered before she answered. \" Why, mother, isn't it enough that father knew her poor mother, and would befriend her child, behaviour which is like father, as you know ? Then I was so taken with her when I was a small mite that it is like realizing an old ideal to come across her again. I don't know that she quite answers my expectations \u2014 who ever does answer one's expectations'? \u2014 but she is wonderfully pretty and unaffected, and sweet to those she cares for. It is really refreshing and delightful to see how she pins her faith to that big, rather stupid brother of hers, and hangs on every word he says. Sisters don't look up to brothers, and depend upon them in that way nowadays.\""], [209, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 197 \" She's a silly,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, contemptuously. \" It ;is a fair shame for a great girl like that not to have a \u2022ounce of common-sense or self-reliance of her own.\" \" I don't think she is in the least a fool, it is her train ing, and her disadvantages,\" said Mattie, slowly and thoughtfully. \" I am afraid she will feel them more and more the older she grows, poor girl 1 But you must own, mother, there is a charm about these Beauchamps, whether caste has anything to do with it or not. He has the air of a dull duke, aud she could wear what would have made any other girl look like a pork-butcher's daughter, and yet appear as perfect a lady as Lady Theresa herself.\" \" And why shouldn't a pork-butcher's daughter have her holiday, and dress as she pleases ? \" Mrs. Hobbs caught up her daughter, snappishly. \"I did not say she shouldn't,\" said Mattie, com posedly. \"I only implied that she might not, and you know she does not, as a rule, show great taste in her Sunday's best. As for that silent, patient-looking Sir John,\" Mattie went off at a tangent, \" he puts me in mind of the butler who married his mistress, and was recommended to wear a good coat and hold his tongue, whereby he earned the reputation of being the most sensible man in England. I am afraid the last com parison is not altogether complimentary, or entirely fair. In all save his taciturnity, poor Sir John does not re semble that fabled butler, the mentally stranded duke is the better simile. He is like the speechless starling, one takes it for granted that the more he thinks the less he says. There is something inscrutable in his silence. I make no question but that he is a most ordinary young man ; yet by dint of not babbling of polo-matches, and private theatricals, crack-shots, and winning-posts at races, one is constantly expecting pearls of wit and wisdom to fall from his moustached lips.\" \"I ain't going to admit that there is anything out of the common in those Beauchamps, brother and sister,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with unusual irritability, for though she was quick and sharp she was not peevish. \" He is"], [210, "198 A MORNING MIST. a stick, if ever there were one \u2014 not that I don't go for to pity him \u2014 a poor lot with a handle to his name, and that gaby of a sister holding on to him.

Empty sacks has a trick of not standing straight, that's true, but the praise and the credit are about equal. Better fill the sack ; but that there Sir John o' yourn won't never do that, not he, if he lives to be ninety-and-nine. It ain't in his long sides and long nose.\" \" Then he need not be blamed for it, need he ? \" asked Mattie, lightly ; \" and money-making is not everything in this world.\" \"I never said it were,\" retorted Mrs. Hobbs, still with unwonted touchiness ; \"but if Sir John is to do anything for his kind, it mun be by being a mixture of warning and example, showing how a chap may be cut off from his likes and yet keep his feet, not take to drink, or put his hand into his mate's pocket.\" \" Don't you think you're just a little hard upon the poor fellow ? \" said Mattie, reproachfully. \" No ; I bean't nothing of the kind,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, doggedly, \"and I likes the lad a deal better than the lass, but I ain't charmed with any Beauchamp of .them, and I ain't going to pertend to be.

For why ? it is you or your father as is to furnish the gilding.

But you're a big sight wrong if them's your thoughts \u2014 a lady at heart, which her might: be, though her were one of them pork-butcher's wives or daughters as you've spoke saucy of, would open her mouth out of her superior years and experience, if nought more, to her own flesh and blood. Her might have been as mild as milk, it may be, but I ain't mild and mannerly, the rnore's the pity. Anyhow I can tell you what will happen if you pays no heed to my words, you'll get yourself talked on, and you'll land yourself and another party in a mess. That you will. It will seem both to lookers-on, and likewise to the actors in the play that you're holding out such encouragement as you mayn't dream of fulfilling to Sir John Beauchamp to make up to you. You've no right to draw on the lad, and humble him when you are sure of your answer, and if you ain't sure, you had better consult father and me what we've to say afore you go farther in this game.\" \"My dear mother, you are labouring under a delusion,\" cried Mattie, recovering herself, and growing cool again. She had a little difficulty to keep from laughing, but she was aware that her mother would resent laughter above everything. \" You mean the very best, in honesty and kindness, I know that well, but nothing, not a word or look, has passed between Sir John Beauchamp and me, to warrant such a precaution on your part. The ordinary intercourse of society and mere accident have thrown us together. If he is not enough of a gentleman to see that, if he is such a fool under his sphinx-like mask of silence, as to presume on what is simply good-nature, good-feeling, and a chance association, then I am afraid there is no help for it, he must pay the penalty,\" said Mattie, with a shade of hauteur, which made her look of high spirit and all round capacity doubly formidable. It afforded an indica tion of the fact that she could dispose of false, un-"], [212, "200 A MORNING MIST. authorized claims on her favour with sufficient vigour, and with not too much mercy. As a handsome, accessi ble girl, the daughter of a very rich man, she had, with out giving more provocation than she could avoid, found early practice in the delicate operation. \"If you ain't a-eutting off your own nose or Sir John's, you're playing with all your might into Joe's hand, and doing your utmost to help him to cut off his nose, and no mistake,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, almost with a groan. \"Joe!\" exclaimed Mattie, in astonishment. \"What about Joe ? What has he got to do in the matter ? \" \" Martha Hobbs,\" protested her mother, sternly, \"you don't mean to tell me as you're as blind as a bat, and that engrossed with your own affairs you can't see what is under your eyes, and has to do with your own brother? You don't tell me as you've not found out for yourself, up to this minute, that our Joe is as sweet as sweet can be on yon Beauchamp girl \u2014 he is that dead set on her that, being what the boy is, I ain't expecting he'll ever get over it.\" \" Oh, no, no ! \" said Mattie, quickly, and yet with a certain troubled, dismayed expression crossing her frank, fearless face, \" you must be mistaken again, mother. Your imagination must be running away with you com pletely thismorning. Joeis always raving about something or somebody. He is enchanted with half the girls he sees, just as he is enchanted with Corot bits in a landscape, or Wilkie-groups in a crowd, or with any promising pro gramme issued by an emigration society. Unfortu nately, disenchantment with the girl is apt to come more speedily, and to be more lasting, than it is with the other attractions.\" \" You're wrong,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with quiet convic tion; \" and one sign is that he don't rave or rant ; he is as dumb about what he thinks on her as that great log of a brother of hers eau be. But I tell you Joe can't keep his eyes off that slip of a girl, or see or hear ought besides when she is by. My lad's done for, that's plain.\" \"Oh, I hope not, mother ! \" replied Mattie, in per-"], [213, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 201 plexity and vexation. \" Constance Beauchamp is all very well,\" said Joe's sister, slowly and sadly, \"very pretty and nice and that kind of thing, but Joe \u2014 oh, \u2022dear, no ! she is not half good enough for Joe. She could never understand him, she could not bear his burdens and share his triumphs. But don't you think, mother, if there is anything in what you say,\" went on Mattie, wistfully, \" there is nothing that I have done, or can do, which would make a difference ? We could not interfere in what concerns him so nearly, so much more than it touches other people, even his family. Father would not interpose, and he has the best right. We must leave Joe to judge for himself, mustn't we, mother ? \" \" It ain't whether us will or won't,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, gloomily; \"Joe, though he is so easy to deal with in many ways, do know his own mind, and will stick to it when it comes to that ; he ain't his father's son for nothing. If he be strong on the rights aud wrongs of working-men, he won't give up his man's right to choose and do for himself when he sees fit. I ain't saying that having the girl here with her brother will make any great odds,\" she granted relentingly, at the sight of her daughter's rueful face ; \" only it is more than a body's stomach can stand to have them Beauchamps patted on the back, brought for'ard, and rammed down your throat on all occasions, if so be one of them is to he the heart-break and ruination of as fine a fellow as ever lived \u2014 though I should say it \u2014 like my poor Joe ! \" \"Not so bad as that, mother \u2014 not nearly so bad,\" pro tested Mattie. \"Besides, it may be all fancy, like that of poor Sir John's suit to me, which I am certain he never dreamt of paying.\" Mrs. Hobbs shook her head. \" Take no rash vows, Martha Hobbs ; you just wait and see. A stout spirit of contradiction ain't a great defence, and we all knows what pride goes before \u2014 we've Scripture for that. Them cattle of gentry ain't to be trusted. They're very well jn their way, with you speaking them fair. But their"], [214, "202 A MORNING MIST. way ain't our way, and they can't never abide to be put in the wrong or made to play second fiddle.\" In the meantime Constance, in happy ignorance of the profound uneasiness she was arousing in her neigh bours' bosoms, had made up her mind to swallow the mortification of belonging to the Kingsmeadows party at the Hunt ball, and to enjoy it to the utmost of her ability. She had had her reward at once. She was delighted with her pretty white dress, which looked so simple, and yet fell so gracefully, and was so dainty in its details. Miss WTest was equally pleased. \"There must be something after all in these West End dress makers, with the French names, Connie, for now I am certain that you look as you ought to look, and this Madame Mathilde's bill is a few shillings less than Miss Griffin's. Perhaps it ought to be, for there is not half the work in this that there is in the satin ; but then the style \"is so superior, as we can see at a glance, and I should have thought that the style would have to be paid for. I am afraid to add even a finishing touch, or advise you to put on your topazes, lest the effect should be marred ; but I have a string or two of Roman pearls, which I am persuaded will go well with this dress,\" and Miss West was right. There were so many people, quite nice people, as Constance owned, at Kingsmeadows, besides Sir John and his sister, that she felt the superior freedom of a crowd to a family party in addition to the consciousness of being in good company. It helped her to get rid of her strain of shyness. Everybody w7as in excellent spirits, predicting the best ball they had had for a num ber of years, and chatting gaily, as it sounded, of other balls, which were no novelties to the speakers. Dinner was an hour earlier than usual, and nobody was expected to dress except the ladies who had dinner gowns or tea-gowns they wished to display. When Constance came to think of it there was nobody she disliked very much in the great boiler-maker's family except her bite noire, Mrs. Hobbs. The boiler-maker might be an honour to his country as Sir John had said."], [215, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 203 Constance had no decided objection to him or his honours. She did not mind his heaviness and serious ness when they were divided among a score of guests, and he had no more attention to spare to her than was expressed in a gravely friendly greeting. She had a vague notion, absurd as it seemed, that the master of the house somehow stood a little in awe of her, as she stood of him, and the vague notion, together with the earnest, almost solemn kindness of his manner helped to reconcile her to him. She did not mind young Hobbs, who was a good deal occupied in discharging the duties of the son of the house to a houseful of guests, if he would but keep still. Constance imagined it was a matter of course that Joe Hobbs should ask her to let him put down his name on her card for several dances. She believed it was because he understood she knew almost nobody that he placed his initials opposite more than one dance, and she had no doubt that when he found she could get other partners \u2014 surely she would have a few, she did not care for more \u2014 he would not seek to claim her. What engrossed her now was the dignity of possessing a card and seeing anybody scrawl here and there on it. It did not strike her that it was a liberty on Joe Hobbs's part, to send her up flowers, along with those he sent to his sister. It was merely a polite recognition of a guest, and Miss Hobbs was so nice about it. She brought all the flowers into Constance's room, and asked her to take her choice, looking on quietly while she did so. When Constance hesitated about selecting a cluster of pale blush roses, which were so much more beautiful than the others that it seemed grasping to appropriate them : \" Please take them,\" said Mattie, with ungrudging generosity, while she spoke gravely in connection with such a trifle, \" I think they were meant for you.\" Constance admired Miss Hobbs more than anything or anybody unless Sir John. It was not simply the charm of her dark, bright beauty, or the subtle flattery of her pleasant reminiscences of Dinglemouth \u2014 in which the child Constance and her father, Sir Randal, were"], [216, "204 A MORNING MIST. prominent figures \u2014 that fascinated the girl. Without being fit to analyse it, Constance felt keenly the spell of Mattie's strong, beautiful personality, her extraordinary amount of energy, her wealth of interest. She was able to suit herself to everything and everybody ; while always in request herself. She was constantly capable of re sponding to every claim made on her, so that nobody was baulked, or sent away empty. It was an amplification, and, at the same time, a modification of Mrs, Hobbs's nature. Yet Constance shrank with lively aversion from the mother, while she turned with delight to the daughter. There was not a single fault which her admirer could see in her. She was as instinctively delicate-minded and full of tact, as if she had been the daughter of a prince instead of a boiler-maker. She was as gracious and considerate in her maidenhood, as bent on conferring benefits and pleasures on all sorts and con ditions of men as if she had been a benevolent matron of many years' standing. She was the least self-engrossed girl Constance had ever heard of, for the critic had not known many girls of any kind. Mattie Hobbs seemed actually to have no compelling wishes and aims of her own. If Constance had been qualified to realize it, it was old Joe Hobbs's large heart and large mind, together with Mrs. Hobbs's untiring energy and the sincerity, warmth of heart, and tenderness which kept even pace with her narrow prejudices and cantankerousness, that repro duced, as they were, in Mattie, rendered her so irresis tible, in the middle of the superabundant cleverness and culture which, in themselves, might have tended to make foes rather than friends. From Lady Theresa to Sarah Ann, the youngest housemaid at Kingsmeadows, every body who approached Mattie Hobbs was disposed to depend upon her, was so far swayed by her and wrought upon by her, as to behave his or her best under Mattie's influence. She never found fault with you, Never implied Your -wrong by her right, Yet men at her side"], [217, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 205 \" Grew nobler, girls purer, Till through the -whole town The children were gladder That plucked at her gown.\" Constance could not detect a flaw in her idol at this stage of their acquaintance. Even Mattie's manner towards her brother, which Miss West had condemned, filled Constance with a kind of admiring wonder and envy. Of course, she could never dream of emulating it, nor would it be fit from her to Sir John, but still it was a revelation to hear Mattie say, \" Joe, you must do so-and-so ; you must arrange that the omnibuses are not too crowded, and you must not put Milly Hatherley into the same carriage with Willie Fenton, for \u2014 well, one must tell tales sometimes, lest worse should come of it \u2014 she refused him six months ago, and it would be rather a bad three-quarters of an hour for both if they had to spend the time in close proximity driving to the County Hall at Dorrington. And \u2014 oh ! I say, Joe, you must find plenty of nice partners for poor Willie, and Tom, and Edgar ; I will look after their sisters, introduce them right and left, and not let them sit above a single dance ; because they are very fond of dancing, poor dears ! and I want the Hunt Ball to be a bright spot in their fives.\" \"Any more orders, Mattie?\" asked Joe, with a grimace. \" How many dowagers to take in for refresh ments ? \" \" I leave that to your good feeling, and to the exigen cies of circumstances,\" replied Mattie, with a successful assumption of sober superiority. Joe professed to be impatient of his sister's instruc tions, but it was clear that he meant to follow them, and that though he thought her weak-minded in not recognizing the superior claims of cricket, he relied on her judgment in other matters, and consulted her on most occasions. Constance herself was so much en thralled by Mattie that she really was rather pleased when the grown-up daughter of the family proposed, as if under a sudden impulse, to take the visitor into the"], [218, "206 A MORNING MIST. schoolroom before the girls went to dress, that she might make the acquaintance of the younger members of the household. \" I should like it very much indeed,\" said Constance, quite cordially. \" I don't know much about children, but I have seen your young brothers and sisters in church, and thought what nice boys and girls they looked. My brother, too, took a fancy to them when he saw them all together on the lawn the first day he was here. I shall be very glad to be introduced to them.\" In the spacious, comfortable schoolroom, fitted up with every modern educational appliance, and supplied with a very respectable aviary in one window, a set of blooming, blithe boys and girls, their governess presid ing over the tea-tray, were gathered round the central table. The whole formed a pretty, cheerful scene to the girl who had grown up in solitude, if the picture had not been spoilt by the presence of the dragon, Mrs. Hobbs, at the foot of the amply supplied table. She was standing, her dress protected by a napkin, while she sliced down a special cake provided in honour of the birthday of somebody present. \" What are you seeking here, with Miss Beauchamp, Mattie ? \" demanded the matron, with a frown, and in tones which made Con stance inclined to take flight on the instant. \"You're disturbing them children. There's little Ally Parry getting up to give you her chair. Sit down again this moment, Ally ; Miss Hobbs don't want a chair, nor for that matter do Miss Beauchamp. You two will be late in dressing, keeping everybody \u2014 the horses worst of all \u2014 a-waiting, afore you're ready to start for this precious ball. I never did see nothing like the girls of the present day for dawdling.\" \" Mother, mayn't I show the lady the birds brother Joe gave me when I fell off the pear-tree and broke my arm, and had to stay in the house the whole of last Easter? \" piped an amiable young voice. \"No, Mat, you mayn't,\" Mrs. Hobbs forbade him, curtly. \" What do your flue young ladies as are setting out to balls care for boys and their birds ? And I won-"], [219, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 207 der you ain't ashamed of calling attention to your own naughtiness. Your brother Joe might have found some thing better to do when he made you a present of them tiresome birds \u2014 au encouragement to wrong-doing. You broke more than your arm ; you broke the best branch of that there pear-tree, and I, for one, don't expect to \u25a0see it ever the same again.\" Another petitioner took the place of the silenced, crestfallen Mat. It was a little girl this time, the pet -\" youngest,\" whose place was still in the nursery, not the schoolroom, where she was only admitted on suffer ance, to grace special occasions. The small voice was very treble in its sweetness : \" Mother, I am quite sure I have finished ; I don't want any more cake. Give my slice to Ally to take home to her baby. Please will you let me go aud look on while sister Mattie is dressing? \" \" There's more than one, or two, at a bargain-making, Bessie,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, still obdurate. \" I can't tell if nurse can spare you, not no longer ; you ought to be going back with Hannah, and Ben, as is done with the schoolroom for this day. And I don't know as your sister Mattie will care to have you poking about, and getting into the way when she's a-dre3sing. It ain't a profitable employment either for woman or child to stand hand-idle gaping and staring at a dressing-table \u2014 fills the head with nonsense and vanity.\" \"Let her come, mother,\" begged Mattie with her per suasive tongue ; \" I'll answer for nurse ; Bessie is never in my wray when I am dressing. She is as good as gold, ain't you, Bessie ? She hands hairpins to Nash, and she is a perfect ring-holder on her own account. She spreads out all her ten fat little fingers, and never drops a single ring. She 'flirts' my fan, as people used to say, till I'm prepared to flirt it myself. Oh ! Bessie is a great institution. Besides, the taste for looking on at your neighbour dressing is so short-lived, don't you think so, Miss Beauchamp ? It is a treat which so palls with advancing years, that it is a pity not to gratify it when we may.\""], [220, "208 A MORNING MIST. Mrs. Hobbs pounced upon Constance next, \"I hope you ain't given to sore-throats ? \" her hostess challenged the guest, in a manner which signified that it would be a grievance if she did not know what a sore-throat was, and still more an impertinence if she owned to any par- ticular weakness in her tonsils or glands. \" Whether or not,\" Mrs. Hobbs continued, aggressively, \"you had liefer wrap up for the drive. Girls are so silly in not troubling to wrap lest they should crush their finery and frippery. I hope you ain't just so- idiotic as to put off a scrap of your flannels, when you've to face the night air, and the nights beginning to get cold.\" Constance retreated, dumbs ounder ed, discomfited. What a woman to bully her about her throat and meddle with her flannels ! Mrs. Hobbs could not be a proper hostess for Constance's father and mother's daughter. Still Mattie Hobbs did not \"seem to see any- thing far amiss. She said, with a tranquil smile, \" Mother considers she is answerable for your welfare, so long as you are under her charge, and not under Miss West's. Sir John does not count \u2014 no, indeed,\" with laughing determination, as Constance began to protest. \" Men never count as useful chaperons, or as nurses. My brother Joe, in spite of his fidgets, is the best man- nurse I know ; but I would not trust even him on the question of what clothing women should wear under peculiar conditions. You would not suppose mother could be nervous, yet she has been so about sore-throats for many a y*ear. It was a kind of feverish sore-throat which was hanging about the neighbourhood of Willesden that my sister Sally caught and communicated to my brothers Owen and Sam. All three were delicate children, not like Joe and me, or like the children that came after them, and they died of the complaint in the course of ten days. That was before mother and I went for a change to Dinglemouth, where we met you. So poor mother has had a dread of sore throats ever since, though you can see for yourself"], [221, "THE KINGSMEADOWS PARTY. 209 \"that she is not at all a weak or nervous woman naturally.\" Constance could have said she saw it plainly, at least so far as the weakness was concerned, but what she had to do at this moment was to try and forget her disa greeable, under-bred hostess, and give herself up to the satisfaction of her first ball. 14"], [222, "CHAPTER XVII. CONSTANCE BEAUCHAMP'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. There was no hurry in Constance's hands any more than there was hurry in the hands of Miss Rossetti's heroine ; but there was always swiftness, if not hurry, in Mattie's dexterous fingers, supple with exercise. She dressed in what looked to Constance an incredibly short time, then sent her maid to offer to help Miss Beauchamp, and at last came to ask to be admitted herself, appearing leading her sister Bessie by the hand. \" Here is a little girl who is deeply disappointed because I am all ' fixed,' as the Americans say, and there is no pre- tence under which she can stay by me any longer. In fact, I am going to see what my friends Miss Hatherley and Miss Fenton are about, and to do what I can for them. Bessie is trying to make out that I won't do ; that my frock or something is not right,\" looking down nonchalantly at her pretty dress, almost similar to Con- stance's ; \" but I don't believe her. I am conceited enough to be satisfied with my war-paint, even though it should be a little eclipsed by yours. Would it dis- turb you very much to have Bessie look on at your finish- ing touches ? She is very good, she will stand quite still and not touch anything. She will not speak till she is spoken to. Do you hear, Bessie ? I am pledging my credit for your being a well-behaved little girl. She has fallen in love with you, and has a burning desire to clasp your braclet and hold your fan.\" \"I shall be very well pleased,\" said Constance, laugh ing. '' I did not know what to do with your maid. I could not find any service I required from her, for I am"], [223, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 211 not accustomed to a maid. But I am sure Bessie and I will get on splendidly together. She will keep me from forgetting anything, and she w7ill take me to the drawing-room, for I am sorry to say I am not at all sure of my way. I am stupid in a large house like this.\" Bessie was, as her father had said, a miniature edi tion of her mother and Mattie, with the same black brows, dark brown eyes, and warm red in the brown complexion. She was more timid than Mrs. Hobbs could ever have been, and she would never be so Clevel and wise as Mattie showed herself, but she was, in her baby fashion, as honest, earnest, and friendly. \" See, Bessie, this is Miss West's pearl necklace, which she has been so kind as to lend me. Look, I am clasp ing it round my throat, and these are the bracelets to match, which I twist up \u2014 so, and so, till they look like ropes, pearl-ropes ; isn't that funny ? \" said Constance, seeking to entertain the child. \" Yes, lady,\" acquiesced Bessie, with a' long sigh of content in the operations she was required to observe; \"but you have not so many rings as sister Mattie has and yours don't shine like hers. She would only put on one or two of them. If I run and ask her she will be very happy to let you have some of her rings.\" \"No, thanks, dear, I have enough,\" answered Con stance, \" though I grant you they are not nearly such pretty rings as your sister Mattie has. Look, I am going to put on another bracelet \u2014 this plain gold one, with my mother's name engraved on it ; that is why I like it. You cannot read the raised yellow letters yet, I daresay ; but I'll spell them out for you \u2014 B-e-s-s-i-e, Bessie. Why, it is your own name ! \" \" So it is, lady,\" cried Bessie, with a skip of excite ment and delight. \" Your mother was called Bessie, just like me.\" When Constance, pioneered by Bessie, made her way to the drawing-room, she found her brother there alone \u2014 the first of the company. But what a Sir John it was ! If Lady Theresa had decreed that all the younger"], [224, "212 A MORNING MIST. of the ladies attending the ball, who were under her lead, should be distinguished by their simplicity, she had put no embargo on the gentlemen's dress : so far from it, the time-honoured rule was in full force that they should appear in the uniform of the Hunt, and that the gentlemen who were not members, aud who could claim any rank in the army, navy, or volunteers should don their full dress uniform. Therefore there stood Sir John, in all the glory of scarlet and gold facings, braiding and epaulettes complete, as Constance had never seen him. He was handsome enough, in his fair, statuesque good looks, to carry off the gorgeousness of his attire, which he wore with the natural dignity and careless in difference of a man who has worn it many a time before, and was rather tired of its barren splendour. But it would be hard to say whether little Bessie or Constance was the more dazzled with this example of the pomp and circumstance of glorious war. \" It is the beautifullest coat I ever saw,\" exclaimed Bessie, enthusiastically, forgetting her shyness. \" I am glad you like it, little woman,\" said Sir John, stooping down that she might the better admire the magnificence of his buttons. One of the few attributes he held in common with his father was his love of children. \" Yes, indeed, John, it is a beautiful coat, very grand and becoming,\" declared Constance, walking round him. \" I wish it were the fashion for you to wear your uniform every day.\" \" The Fates forbid ! \" said Sir John, more energetically than usual. \" Why not ? \" asked Constance, thinking that it must be an excess of modesty and generosity which could make him not desirous to excel his fellow-men or to break the too susceptible hearts of his sister- women ; \" you must be used to wearing it sometimes.\" \" Used indeed ! \" exclaimed Sir John, ruefully, \" I could wish I was not so much used to this trumpery on field days, or when a Governor General or one of the Rovalties is to the front.\""], [225, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 213 \"Don't you like to be seen in your colours,\" said Con stance, reproachfully. \" You don't call this rot my colours ?\" protested Sir John. \" Is uniform an uncomfortable wear?\" asked Con stance, in a puzzled tone. \"Miss West had an uncle, who was never to be seen except in his regimentals.\" \" Rather he than I,\" said Sir John, shrugging his square shoulders. \"It is a horribly expensive wear. Connie, to tell you the plain truth, I can hardly get a suit of even plain uniform under sixteen or eighteen pounds and lean easily get a good common suit for six.\" There was something pitiful in the keen and confidential tones into which Sir John's voice dropped. The impres sion was not removed by his further explanation, though he gave it more carelessly : \" It is not that we army men are ashamed of our colours, but that, for the most part, we cannot afford to sport them.\" Even Constance received a little shock, which she forgot the next moment when her brother took in her tout ensemble in a comprehensive glance from uuder his drooping eyelids, and smiled approval of her appearance. \" You are very nicely got up to-night, Constance ; you do Miss West's taste great credit. You need not waste time admiring my red coat aud tinsel, your white frock is much better worth looking at.\" Constance blushed rosy-red with happiness. If she could have looked fairer than she had looked before, that blush would have completed the charm of her dainty white frock, the pale blush roses in her bodice, her red gold hair carefully patted, pulled, and frizzed high, in what she meant to be an imitation of the heads around her, making the fine shape of the head, and the slender roundness of the white throat, encircled by Miss West's Roman pearls, still more conspicuous. When the company gradually trooped in, little Bessie was still standing in rapt contemplation of her paragons. She woke up on the entrance of her father and mother, bringing up the rear of their guests. \" Oh, mother, father, Mattie, Joe,\" cried the child, iu her clear, pene-"], [226, "214 A MORNING MIST. trating treble, calling upon all her family, and with them the whole world present, to hear her extraordinary piece of news, \" Miss Beauchamp has got a bracelet with my name upon it in big letters \u2014 ' Bessie.' The bracelet was called after her mother, and her mother's name was the same as mine. Is'nt it nice and funny? \" Constance looked up colouring and smiling at the attention thus drawn upon her and her bracelet, and at the little girl's queer childish version of the small bit of family history. She was mystified by the disturbed look which passed over most of the faces in the room, and the eyes which glanced askance at each other, while they studiously avoided meeting hers. Sir John turned aside and opened a book. Surely he was far above any small jealousy of his long-dead step-mother ! Mr. Hobbs cleared his throat with au evident effort. Joe contrived to substitute a totally unmeaning straight line of his brow and mouth for his habitual frown and play of lips. Mattie cried quickly : \" We are all here, and I can catch a reflection of the lights of the omnibuses. What are we waiting for ? \" Mrs. Hobbs fell straightway on poor little unconscious Bessie. \"Bessie Hobbs,\" she addressed the offending infant, \" you ought to be in your bed by this time ; you never ought to have been took from your nurse, to be mixed up with grown-up people's vanities. I bet y7ou won't sleep a wink afore ten o'clock. Go off this minute, and be ashamed of yourself for stopping up to this hour of the night, sticking yourself up in mother's drawing-room, and putting in your owdacious word where it ain't wanted.\" \"Good-night, Bessie ! \" interposed her father, arresting the extinguished little maiden as she slid past him. He put out a big hand, and stroked the hanging head. \" Be a good girl, see you are up with the lark in the morning, and that will show mother you did not mean to turn night into day.\" \"A fine lesson to teach the child, Joe Hobbs, that wrong is thxt easy to wips away,\" his wife faced round upon him."], [227, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 215 \" Wrong as light as this isn't hard to rub out,'-* he answered, quickly. As for Mrs. Hobbs, she was saying to herself bitterly, \"My Bessie, too! Her is about the age, and is the living picture of Mattie when she was first infatuate with young madam. What is there about her as is that taking to some folks ? I prefer the glum, tired-out look ing brother. He do have a look as if he knew summat of the hards of life, for all he is Sir John in his dandy officer's coat.\" Constance soon lost sight of every jar, such as life has eveu in its most joyous moments. The seven miles' drive was not long to her. The familiar town had put on a wholly festal aspect. The small crowd of street boys and working-women, watching the country-house parties arrive and alight at the entrance to the old fashioned, rather shabby county-hall, which served for assembly-rooms in the High-street of Dorrington, was the world looking on at a brilliant spectacle. The buzz of admiration, aroused chiefly by the ladies' dresses, was the trumpet voice of fame. The evergreens and hunting trophies, adorning the staircase and the walls, filled her with unsophisticated admiration. The very chalked floor, of which she had read as exemplified on a far more extensive and exalted scale in hundreds of novels, made her young blood dance and her feet feel as if they were treading on air. Lady Theresa Langton opened the ball with the M.F.H. at the head of one of the sets of quadrilles, in another of which Constance danced with Joe Hobbs, while they had Mattie Hobbs and Sir John for their vis-arms. Constance was prepared for Sir John's dancing with Mattie Hobbs, because he and his sister were in the Kingsmeadows party, and because young Hobbs was dancing with her \u2014 Constance. The thing was quite clear, and perfectly excusable to Constance, and to her relief Mr. Joe Hobbs did not begin to talk to her of strikes, and trades unions, or the comparative virtues of malleable or cast iron \u2014 a jumble of subjects of which she had a dread. She neither knew nor cared about"], [228, "216 A MORNING MIST. them for one thing, and for another she had her dancing and the figures of the dance on her mind. Of course Miss West had taken care that she was carefully trained in dancing, but she had only learned figure dances by attending her dancing-master's morning classes in a ladies' school at Dorrington while Constance was still too young to form undesirable acquaintances. She had1 not danced in company, and she felt she would be flurried and put out if her partner assailed her with questions as much out of keeping with the scene as if he had proposed to her to discuss problems in algebra. But he contented himself with talking gaily and pleasantly of the company,. telling her who was who, and giving her little sketches not wanting in point, and yet never ill-natured, of the characters in the amateur ballet. He professed himself to be comparatively a stranger among them, just as she was, yet he knew all about them, as he and his sister knew everything. He could even tell her some amusing stories of the departed glories of the place, when just such a company as was assembled that night had thought it no waste of time and trouble to drive cheerfully over a good deal worse roads once a month to dance endless sets of quaint country dances, play cards, and swallow white soup and negus, according to the graphic accounts in Miss Austen's novels. Constance was agreeably surprised by her partner. She was sure that he was a great deal more amiable and entertaining than Darcy and nearly as nice as Henry Tilney. His dark, thin face and figure looked not only the outward attributes of a pleasant, intelligent gentle man ; he was almost handsome, he had almost a distin guished air in his hunt uniform, and he danced remark ably well, with something of the quiet, sauntering grace which might have been expected from a Sir John, but which was in broad contrast to young Joe Hobbs's ordinary, abrupt, restless movements. The change was like a parody on the lines on Garrick, which declared that it was only on the stage that he was easy and un affected, in fact, \" not acting.\" It seemed that it was in moving to music that Joe Hobbs was at rest. Con-"], [229, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 217 stance quite enjoyed her dancing with him. She was tempted to forget that he had a mother, and that Hobbs senior was a great boiler-maker. She was ready to confess that she liked him \u2014 at least, as well as any other partner she had \u2014 and she really had a great many, more than she had hoped for, more than she knew what to do with. For, unaccustomed as she was to such excitement, such late hours, and so great an amount of exercise, she found herself, to her mortifi cation, more easily tired than the other girls of her age were, than Mattie Hobbs, for instance. Mattie had said she did not care for dancing particularly, yet she danced as if she could go on for ever, without a trace of fatigue, and naturally she was the most popular partner in the room. Constance's partners were, for the most part, eligible members of the county families around. They were Sir John's recent acquaintances, or they were introduced to her by one or other of the Hobbses. Even Mrs. Hobbs was alive to a chaperon's duties, and did not fail to discharge them grimly, presenting a succession of pink-coated men to Miss Beauchamp. Perhaps the elder woman nourished a faint hope in her Spartan breast, when she heard people saying Sir John's sister was without doubt one of the beauties of the evening, that an enthralled aspirant to her favour, who would distance young Joe in the girl's proud, shallow estima tion, might turn up. But the greater number of Constance's partners wearied her by asking her the same question over and over again. Some hummed and hawed. Some talked town to her, and all that she knew of town was out of newspapers and novels. Others tried to entertain her in a horsey, houndy jargon, which she did not in the least understand. Joe Hobbs was like an old acquaintance, well-nigh an old friendly companion. But her disappointments in her partners were as motes in the sun of the night's exceptional brilliance and happi ness. For was not Sir John more than satisfied with her looks ? And did she not see him the observed of all observers, the most aristocratic and fine-looking man"], [230, "218 A MORNING MIST. there? He danced with Lady Theresa and lesser luminaries \u2014 not so often as she w7ould have liked to see him ; but he could not be expected to make himself cheap, just as it would be beneath his aagust preten sions to chatter and talk nonsense like ordinary young men. Constance thought it was not unlikely that he had got a surfeit of dancing before she ever saw his face. She had to confess he danced not merely languidly, but a trifle formally and mechanically, as if he were perform ing a small penance. For that reason, young Hobbs, strange to say, showed to greater advantage on the floor \u25a0of a ballroom. How much Constance would have to tell Miss West next day ! She was quite glad to excuse herself from dancing now and then \u2014 not only to rest, but that she might take mental stock of what was going on around her, so as to forget nothing in the recapitulation of the events of the evening. Of course there were some slight shades in the pic ture, which just served to lend it greater effect, or of which Constance, in her inexperience, was unobservant. She had to go down to supper with an elderly gentle man \u2014 no less a personage than Lady Theresa's husband, who was anything rather than a lively companion. If Con stance had only known, it was by an act of self-denial where Joe Hobbs was concerned, and considerable man agement on the part of Mattie Hobbs, that Miss Beau champ was conducted to the supper-room by the mag nate, whom she had not sufficient knowledge of the world to hold at his proper value. Fortunately for the girl's unimpaired self-respect and perfect content ment, she did not notice, that though she had abundant support from the gentlemen in the room, there was some hanging back on the side of the ladies. It was not Lady Theresa's fault, she was, for once in her life, constant to a fancy ; she honourably redeemed her implied pledge by paying Miss Beauchamp all the atten tion she could spare from a host of applicants. It was not that the feminine denizens of the world in the neighbourhood of Maisonette were prompted to gratify"], [231, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 219 any petty spite the fruit of Constance's unanimous elec tion, by the votes of the male half of the assembly, to the rank of one of the belles of the ball. It was simply that there are no classes of individuals more strictly conservative, more wedded to a social code, than the ladies of county families who are accustomed to spend the most of their lives in the country \u2014 who, in spite of the vagabond tendencies of the present generation, con tent themselves with a week or two in town at the height of the season, and an occasional brief trip abroad. Sir John was all very well, though he was, poor fellow 1 \u2014 not by his own doing, certainly \u2014 as ineligible as the most impecunious younger brother. His mother had been a lady, as his father had been a gentleman, and if Sir Randal had treated her shockingly neither she nor her son could help that. But of Miss Beauchamp's mother the less said the better, in every respect. The county might accept the innocent daughter in time \u2014 particularly now that her brother had come home and been so mag nanimous as to acknowledge her ; but the ladies, in spite of Lady Theresa, were not prepared to meet her at once with open arms, as it seemed their husbands, sons, and brothers \u2014 so like men ! \u2014 were ready to greet her. The one thing which seriously disturbed Constance's equanimity was an absurd contretemps , so absurd that she felt she would be very silly if she allowed it to put her out. If came directly from the Dunstables of White moat, of whom Mattie Hobbs had suffered herself to speak disparagingly ; and indirectly it had to do with Mattie herself \u2014 whom everybody, gentle aud simple, save the Dunstables and people of their kind, respected, and liked, and forgave for being so pretty and clever and rich : so thoroughly a lady, when she was but the daughter of a self-made boiler-maker, with a mother who spoke like a peasant, and did not care what home truth she enunciated in her rustic dialect. And the reason why Mattie took most hearts by storm was that she was so willing to find some good in everybody ; but she could not find much gocd in these Dunstables, a family of fairly well-born, but pushing, ill-natured small gentry."], [232, "A MORNING MIST. 220 A bird in the air had told them of Lady Theresa's ordin ance with regard to the younger ladies' dress for the annual local function ; and they had, so to speak, taken the trick in the game by coming to the ball in plain black net, without a single embellishment except a few clusters of carnations or sweet-peas, which might have been grown in a cottage-garden. Constance bad been struck by the demureness, well-nigh austerity, in the cos tumes of the three sisters, all big, large-boned girls, handsome in a bold, hard, sketchy fashion. She had inquired their names, and knew who they were before she sat near them, and could not help catching snatches of their conversation. \" I hope you see the new dodge of our Brummagem neighbours,\" said a sardonic Dun stable brother, as lantern- j awed and sketchy in his outline as his sister, \"There was a certain emperor, once, who tried his matrimonial luck in every Court in Europe. There was not a poor and paltry princess by a morganatic marriage that he did not pay suit to, in order that her left-handed claims to royal rank might bolster up his brand-new pinch-beck crown.\" Here Constance -was mystified, and could not identify either the original case or its parallel. \"Oh, you mean the double alliance between tin and title, and more tin and the title's half-bred sister,\" answered one of the girls, with a careless licence of speech which enhanced the insolence of the speaker's tone and words. The involuntary listener lost the next observation in the louder strains of the band. When the musicians again played piano pianissimo, the precocious Dunstable youth was saying, \"Well, in the case of the second match, I thought the chip of the gigantic tradesman, who pleases himself by aping Don Quixote, would have had it in the blood to make a better bargain, to sell in a higher market. As for the first, there is always the title and the barber's block. I don't doubt she would relish being ' my lady,' though the baronet is landless, and her family would be called on to supply the bread-and-butter.\" \" I believe there are no such worshippers of titles as"], [233, "CONSTANCE'S FIRST AND LAST BALL. 221 your radicals and republicans at home and across the Atlantic,\" said another girl, dogmatically. Again Constance lost the rejoinder. Then the third Miss Dunstable remarked audibly, \" The future ' my lady ' knows what she is about. She has sufficient shrewdness to seek to disarm criticism of her own antecedents, to go no farther back than her gracious and polished mother, by striking up friendships with all and sundry. I believe one of the men in the Kingsmeadows party to-night is a clerk, not in a Government office, and one of the girls is a nurse for pay, as Miss Hobbs professed to be for pleasure. But she also takes care to hang on by the skirts of my lady Paramount, and will not lose sight of any chance of ' bettering herself,' as servants say.\" Constance had not the key to the whole of the mali cious insinuations, but she was hot and indignant at what ;she had the wit to make out. The speakers had not once glanced towards her in the course of the conversa tion, and she could not be certain that they were aware of her vicinity or how far the sound of their voices was carried in the changes of the music. But she left her seat as soon as she could to get out of earshot of the scandalmongers, and she noticed as a consequence of her movement, first a dead silence, and then a muffled titter of uneasy laughter running through the group. How presumptuous and impertinent they were ! It was bad enough to give her to Joe Hobbs ; but to mate Sir John with Mattie Hobbs \u2014it was an unpardonable offence, which caused Constance's cheeks to flame and her blue eyes to flash. What though Miss Hobbs was a charming girl in herself, and had been kindness itself \u00b1o Constance ? What was that to Sir John Beauchamp's merits and rights ? The people would be mad as well as malicious who should liken them to each other. Mattie, who was so sensible, and so full of thought for others, would be the last person to be guilty of such an egre gious error, and Constance w7ould be a goose if, after a moment's reflection, she let the idle, unbecoming gossip rankle in her mind and spoil her first ball."], [234, "CHAPTER XVIII. THE DESOLATION THAT COMETH IN A NIOHT. In the course of a couple of days after the Hunt Ball, the party at Kingsmeadows had dispersed. Mattie Hobbs had found leisure to allow herself a good morning's painting. She was startled by the entrance of her brother Joe, whom she had seen ride off to the station on his way to London. He came in suddenly, looking next door to ghastly, with his face as pale as its brown colour would permit, his hair in the last state of dishevelment, and flung himself down in the corner of a couch, at the side of her easel, in her painting-room. \"What is it, Joe? What has brought you back? What on earth has happened? \" she cried in one breath, springing up in terror. \"Oh, dear! you don't mean that you have got a telegram to say there is something wrong with father up at the foundry, and you have come for me to go with you and break the news to poor mother ? \" ' ' No, no ; father is all right ; what an imagination yon have, Mattie ! \" he answered, in desperation. \"It is over at Maisonette that things are all wrong. Miss West died there unexpectedly this morning. Major Coxe told me on the platform \u2014 luckily, the train was late. It is not a mere report, for I called in at Dr. Mason's on my road home. Mattie, what will she do \u2014 Constance Beauchamp ? Such a shock, such a blow ! All the mother she has ever known, and she a tender, delicate young girl ! Only a man with her, and he not likely to be a helpful beggar in an emergency,\" said Joe, wiping his heated brow. \"I am so sorry. Poor Miss West! Poor, poor"], [235, "DESOLATION COMETH IN A NIGHT. 223 Constance Beauchamp ! How little we anticipated what was to occur so soon, when she was so happy the night of the ball,\" said Mattie, with sincere commiseration. \"To be left with nobody but a man and a parcel of servants in such circumstances ! \" he kept insisting, wist fully. \" She has been so cared for till now. I daresay she never saw so much as a cat or a bird die, and she depended entirely on Miss West. At least she will escape the horrors of an inquest. I made sure of that. Miss West, poor woman ! had not been feeliog well for some time, though she had said nothing about it. She took the opportunity of Sir John's having gone a long walk with Constance \u2014 with Miss Beauchamp \u2014 to drive in alone to Dorrington one day last week and consult Mason professionally. He says he was alarmed by her symptoms, and cautioned her, as she wished to be told the truth, of a danger of blood to the head. As soon as her seizure was discovered this morning, he was sent for, aud he was just in time \u2014 to see her alive, I mean, not to do anything for her \u2014 so an inquest can be avoided. But to think of a girl like that \u2014 alone, save for her brother and the servants, with the dead, the friend of her whole life taken from her almost without a moment's warning, it is too terrible ! \" Joe started up and proceeded to pace the room with his hands thrust into his pockets, and his shoulders drawn up to his ears, as at an act of in humanity on which an unfeeling world was looking unmoved. \"It is awfully sad,\" said Mattie, seeking to calm him down, \"but it might have been worse, you know, Joe ; Miss West might have died before Sir John came home from India, while the brother and sister were still strangers to each other, and she had hardly a friend she could call her own \u2014 one of the many evils of leading a too secluded life. Now she has her brother \u2014 who really cares for her, I am certain, in his quiet way \u2014 whom she adores. And she has made a good many friends since his return, who will feel for her, and be ready to do all they can to comfort her.\" \" Miserable help, cold comfort,\" protested Joe, waving"], [236, "224 A MORNING MIST. his long arms, and fairly grinding his teeth. \" I asked Mason if he had sent to tell Parry \u2014 if he knew whether Mrs. Parry had gone to Maisonette. What do you think he answered? \u2014 that he had had some words with Parry about his ritualistic practices ; besides, if Sir John wished to see the clergyman he would send for him. As for Mrs. Parry, she was labouring under a bad bilious attack, and I believe he added that his own wife ' was from home, while his daughters had very little acquaint ance with Miss Beauchamp : Miss West had always kept her so much to herself. Exactly what one might expect from two women like Mrs. Parry and Mrs. Mason \u2014 to be ill and from home at the very moment they were wanted.\" \"Joe, dear, don't be so frightfully unreasonable and unfair. Mrs. Parry is really ill. Mother was at the Rectory looking after her yesterday ; and, of course, Mrs. Mason is entitled to go from home when she chooses ; she could not foresee a misfortune's happening in her absence. If you will forgive me for saying so, I think Dr. Mason was not far wrong ; Sir John is the person to act for his sister. I do not know whether he or she would thank you for rushing about seeking to procure aid and consolation for her. And \u2014 and it looks a little odd, my dear boy. The world is quick to remark on any comparatively recent acquaintance who comes forward on an occasion of this kind, and to invent for him motives, even rights, which do not exist.\" \" You women are all alike,\" broke in Joe, bitterly, flinging himself down again on the couch. ' ' Slaves to public opinion, bound hand and foot to conventionality. One would think common humanity would serve to break your fetters in this instance. It is grossly unfeel ing, barbarous, to leave a young girl, without a woman \u2014 a woman like herself \u2014 by her side at such a time.\" \" Joe, what would you have me to do? \" cried Mattie, goaded in her turn. \" If you think I ought to go over to Maisonette, and stay with poor Constance Beau champ, and that she will be glad to have me, I am ready to do it, as I trust I should be for any person in"], [237, "DESOLATION COMETH IN A NIGHT. 225 trouble \u2014 for any poor man, woman, or child at River meadows. I am not afraid, I have seen death in the hospital wards ; and if I had known in time I should have been only too happy to have gone over and helped to nurse poor Miss West. I think she might have consented \u2014 she was so friendly the last time we met. I don't mind what people say where there is any good to be done, I'll go over to Maisonette if you wish it.\" \" You'll do nothing of the kind, Martha Hobbs,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, entering the room. \" You are one to set outsiders at defiance \u2014 a girl of your age ! Think shame of yourself, and not that bad-hearted and a scholard and that, but you have not lived long enough in the world to measure the length and breadth of folk's tongues and the venom as lurks under them. What ! take up your quarters in a young man's house \u2014 for now Miss West is gone Sir John is a good as master yonder, I take it \u2014 with no better countenance than that of another girl like yourself ? Not if I knows the rights and wrongs of things. Joe, my lad, if you can't tell what is for your own sister's credit, she may thank her stars she has a mother as do. I'll go over myself to Maisonette this morning \u2014 there's some sense in that \u2014 and get things put straight. There's the undertaker, and the registrar, and the dressmaker for the mourning, to be seen to, and their orders given to them. Somebody must find out whether she 'as left directions where her wanted to be buried, or, if not, her friends must fix on the churchyard and the ground. I'd do as much for a neighbour any day. There may be call enough for a woman of my age to step in and tell them what is to be done \u2014 with nobody to see to it but a slip of an ignorant girl and yon long lad, as may have shot tigers or elephants, or even blackies, in India, and yet not know how to bury a poor woman decent in England. She served them Beauchamps faithful while she lived, and I'll see to it she ain't cheated of a proper burial at her death.\" Joe, who had put some restraint upon himself in his mother's presence, looked at Mattie, and Mattie looked 15"], [238, "226 A MORNING MIST. at him, and Mrs. Hobbs looked at both her son and daughter in a kind of subdued triumph. \"This ain't a time to offer a penny for your thoughts, and I wouldn't waste a farthing on them, since I know them without axing. You are thinking the young lady can't abide me, and that my going in on her at such a time will be not to her mind. Ah, but she may change her tune, poor wench, when she has no other woman as knows a thing or two, to turn to and get advice from. The servants at Maisonette will be a deal wiser than the ruck of servants if they ain't half-scared out of their small wits by what has happened there unlooked for this morning ; and instead of doing what is wanted, or even going about their proper business, I'll be bound they've shut their selves together in the kitchen, and are letting their tongues wag like church bells, seeking to forget that they're as frighted as so many hares for night coming. It is ill to be left in a time of need to the mercies of the likes of a set of dressed-up dolls and fools of servant maids, as will think nothing of going off in ecst'ies on their own account, no less.\" Mrs. Hobbs was herself talking for a purpose, to cover the softening of her voice, when she had referred to the girl bereaved of her only friend from childhood, standing alone, save for the young man her brother, in the house of death. Mrs. Hobbs was never able to resist death \u2014 not that she fled from the contact, but it always brought back to her mind with renewed vividness the row of little graves which in past years had risen so rapidly in Joe Hobbs's ground in the churchyard near Willesden, and the long hours she had spent by herself, battling with her sorrow, when her husband was at his work in the foundry, and young Joe and Mattie were absent at school. When Joe Hobbs saw the look on his mother's face, he rose impulsively, and took her hand. He had the air, in Mattie's eyes, as though he could have kissed that hand \u2014 still broadened, though no longer hardened and scored, by honest work \u2014 and she could not help speculating whether he might not have got a stinging box in the ear for his pains."], [239, "DESOLATION COMETH IN A NIGHT. 227 But he had just enough sense left to restrain himself. *' You'll be kiud to her, I know,\" he said, in a half- choked voice ; \" and you'll let me drive you over, mother ? \" he added, coaxingly. ' ' I'll order round the dogcart, and we'll go in half the time.\" \" No, thank you, Joe,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with cool dignity. \"The carriage is fast enough for me\u2014 more by token when I'm going where I'm none so sure as I'll be made welcome, though you're in that hurry to send me. I've no mind to get my bones broke to please any fiery young chap as has lost his head for no great cause that I can see. He may give his best and get it tossed back to him, as I guess I'll get the kindness he counts on, without as much as thank you for the gift. But better that than to have his will, and find as he have pleased his eye to plague his heart.\" Having delivered this Parthian dart, and set down Joe in first-rate style, Mrs. Hobbs relented somewhat, according to her wont. \" I tell you what, Joe, though I want none of your company, not no more than Mattie's, you may send your father over when he comes from town, if I ain't back by that time. Sir John may prefer to hear him rather nor me on what has to be done about the funeral. There is a deal to be thought on, whether there is to be a notice sent to the papers, or if he would like cards printed, and telegrams despatched to Miss West's kin \u2014 she is bound to have had some friends of her own, though she has lived all them years with them Beauchamps. How such a high-spirited, prudent woman could stand servitude, and that with such a master \u2014 he was her master in a sort \u2014 as that ne'er-do-well Sir Randal, and the poor creature his last wife, it beats me to understand ; or how her could shut herself up for a dozen years, and more, with a doll of a fine young lady, like Miss Beauchamp But there, I'll say no more on that head,\" she broke off, dryly, \"for there are folks as may not agree with me, and least said is soonest mended. Anyway, your father won't grudge coming over, and you'll grant he's as fit to send a tele gram as you, and a deal fitter to attend to the rest"], [240, "228 A MORNING MIST. of the melancholy business \u2014 God help him ! it ain't new to him, any more than to me.\" When Mrs. Hobbs arrived at Maisonette she found Sir John, as she had surmised, stunned and bewildered. He was distressed for his sister, and more grieved person ally by Miss West's death than Mrs. Hobbs could have anticipated, so that her opinion of his good feeling and good sense rose considerably. She had no reason to complain of her reception ; he was the next thing to demonstrative in his gratitude. He turned to her and relied upon her as an inexperienced man was likely to rely on a friendly middle-aged woman, not too fine or sensitive or helpless to be of use in the strait. Constance had hurried away to hide herself at the sound of a visitor \u2014 a visitor, when the world was falling to pieces around her, and all the family life she had ever known seemed to have come to an abrupt end ! Mrs. Hobbs had no hesitation in seeking out Constance. \" Now, this won't ever do, Miss Beauchamp,\" she said with her usual freedom of speech, and scarcely a hush in her voice, when she discovered the poor girl cowering in a little room which had been her old schoolroom, and in recent years had been converted into a kind of business. room by Miss West. Small and bare as it was, it was big with memories, very harrowing to Constance at this moment. \" You must get up and come with me,\" said the intruder, authoritatively, as she looked into the pale, tear-stained face, and grasped the cold, trembling hands ; \" moping alone ain't any good, not the least bit in the world. She wouldn't have wished you to do it ; she were too sensible and considerate.\" \" Oh, she was so good, so good to everybody, and, above all, to me ! \" cried Constance, with a burst of choking sobs. \" There \u2014 then, compose yourself,\" commanded Mrs. Hobbs. \" We'll have you in the ecst'ies next, and what ever will your poor brother say and do then ? Men are that lost in trouble.\" \" If I had only known\u2014 if she had told me \u2014 that she went to Dr. Mason last week,\" said Constance, in a voice"], [241, "DESOLATION COMETH IN A NIGHT. 229 of despair, \" and if she had repeated what he said to her I should never have left her for a single instant.\" \" Much good that would have done,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hobbs, bluntly. \" I would never have gone to that miserable ball, where I was so idiotically happy \u2014 wretched girl that I was \u2014 and been a whole night away from her ; the first night I can remember since she came to Fairfields, when I was a little thing.\" \" Then it was high time you was away,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, not meaning in the least to be unkind, merely to state a self-evident truth. \" A young woman like you ! My Mattie has been about by herself, at schools at home and abroad, in an hospital and what not, since she were that high. She could stand alone a'most as soon as she could walk. It were my ambition and her father's that she should be able to stand alone. She did not forget us oncet, or like her home a bit the less \u2014 not she. She is a regular home-bird, when to stay with us don't inter fere with her other duties. No girl as has been all her hfe tied to her mother's apron-strings is a better daugh ter, or fonder of her people, than our Mattie.\" Constance listened listlessly, she was utterly incapa ble of following any line of reasoning which took her away from the thought of the prostrate figure in the room above her, and all she had been to Constance \u2014 nay, w*hich sounded as if it cast an aspersion on the close and tender relations which had existed between them. For Mrs. Hobbs had not her daughter's, or even her son's and her husband's tact, else she would not without any bad intention have chosen the moment when Constance Beauchamp was feeling utterly crushed, in her desolation and helplessness, to descant on Martha Hobbs's helpfulness, and her fidelity to the many ties which claimed her on every side. But Constance was following her own sad reflections, and only lending heedless ears to Mrs. Hobbs's share of the conversation. \"If I had but guessed,\" Constance began again plain tively, \" I should not have slept so soundly. I was in"], [242, "230 A MORNING MIST. my little bed in the dressing-room, and when I awoke, rather late, and wondered why she had not called me Oh ! she could not speak to me, she never spoke to me again, just followed me with her dear, kind eyes \u2014 I think she knew me, and tried to see me to the last.\" \" Very like,\" said^Mrs. Hobbs, in assent this time ; \"you was all she had, and all her thought and care. But you needn't take on so about what you might ha' done ; and it is lost labour, I tell you. It wouldn't have done no good in this case ; more like it would ha ve fretted and worried her. She were best with her God at such a time. He knows best when we can help each other, and when vain is the help of man.\" \"Yes,\" said Constance, doubtfully \u2014 her religious feel ings, though sincere and earnest, were very crude, like everything else about her at this date \u2014 \"but if He had only let me do something for her who did so much for me!\" \" Her liked to do it, and I don't go in for her to have been kept lingering here in pain and weakness, just that you might have pottered about for your satisfaction, not doing her a grain of real good, rather working her harm, hurting her more or less, and she not suffering herself to cry out or say a word, lest she should hurt you. Oh, I'm up to the whole farce. What does a girl like you know about nursing ? Such a play ain't any better than a form of self-pleasing.\" \" Perhaps it is,\" said Constance, dejectedly. \" I have not her to speak to about it now. She knew ; she used to direct me in everything. There, I have not so much as offered you a chair, and you have driven over from Kingsmeadows out of pity for me and respect for her. She would not have been so rude and neglectful.\" \" She knew better,\" said Mrs Hobbs, composedly. \"Her had come to the years of discretion. But there ain't no offence on my part, and I'd as lief not sit down since I want you to come with me.\" \" Oh ! what shall I do without Miss West ? \" lamented Constance."], [243, "DESOLATION COMETH IN A NIGHT. 231 \"You'll do what a many as young, aye, and a many a deal younger and more friendless than you has to do daily \u2014 and does it, the Lord strengthening them. I tell you it is high time you thought for yourself, and for others to boot. Why, you are as much a woman grown as Martha Hobbs is ! And she wouldn't dream of sitting down and making a moan if me and her father were took from her at a stroke. She would think how she could best make up for our loss to young Joe and the children, and what tasks of our'n we'd left for her to take up and finish for our sakes, and for the love of God and man. You are out of your teens, or nigh hand it. I tell you I have seen poor little wenches of eleven or twelve set to do for their fathers, keep house, and bring up the babbies as their dying mothers put in the sisters' arms. Them men and babbies would have been sore bested if the little lasses had not been more of women than you are like to show yourself, if so be you do not take care.\""], [244, "CHAPTER XIX. \" THAT DREADFUL WOMAN,\" ONE OF JOB'S COMFORTERS. Mrs. Hobbs was like a rasping north-east wind blowing on a sheltered spot, which had been suddenly stripped of its protecting screen, and so naturally shrank from the bitter blast. She was like caustic applied to the quiver ing flesh of a raw wound. Yet what was she doing at Maisonette, unless to testify her human pity and magnanimous forbearance towards the sufferer, who was none of her brood \u2014 who was threatening to rob her of the best-beloved of her children ? \"Mrs. Hobbs,\" said poor Constance, turning as a worm will turn, and feeling momentarily a little better for the effort, \"you are much mistaken if you think I should not have done my poor best, and perhaps have forgotten myself in doing it, for my dear father, if he had been spared to me \u2014 oh, would to God he had ! \u2014 or for a helpless baby, if it had been entrusted to my care. Perhaps I give way because I am not like Miss Hobbs, and those poor girls whom you speak of in this, that there is nobody asking anything from me. I shall only be a burden to my brother, as I suppose some people will say I was to her, though no one will ever make me be lieve, now that she is not here to speak for herself, that she ever thought me so. You have no right to imply that I would not have tried to do my duty in other cir cumstances. There, I am rude again\" \u2014 Constance broke down ignominiously in her indignation \u2014 \" after you have troubled to come over, meaning to be of service to me. It must seem so ungracious. It must all have been for her sake, too, and \u2014 and, she was beginning to like you"], [245, "\"THAT DREADFUL WOMAN.\" 233 all, at the last. She said you were kind, and she thought there was something she could trust in you, as there was not in many people who were more like ourselves. I hope you will forgive me \u2014 for her sake, too, and not mind anything I say to-day, and \u2014 and if you will only be so good as to leave me to myself \u2014 I have not been much accustomed to other company than hers, and I am so upset I feel as if I could not bear a word more.\" \" No, I ain't going to leave you,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, stoutly ; \" you ain't fit to be left to yourself, doing nothing when there do be so much to be done. You're all of a tremble again. We'll have you ill on our hands, in no time, if you don't mind.\" \" I'm afraid, I don't mind,\" said Constance, in a half whisper to herself, letting her white face, framed in its disordered golden hair, fall back against the window shutter. \" The more shame to you,\" Mrs. Hobbs came down on her promptly, \" not to care for putting people more about, as has enough, and too much, to think on a'ready. But say your say, bless you, I don't care, I ain't thin-skinned, and to get out what is in your mind may help you a bit, poor soul ! same as a good cry does, though I ain't a one to believe much in crying, good or bad. Now if you would shake yourself up, smart your fingers, and ax what is for dinner.\" \" She always ordered dinner,\" murmured Constance, hiding her face. \"Well, though she aint here to order it no longer, she wouldn't like people to go without their food. The living must eat, though the dead ask no victuals, and some body must take thought for them things. Then there's your mourning, and the servants'. I fancy a bit of crape round his hat or his arm will be all Sir John will want, with her no relation and that.\" \" She always chose my frocks,\" sighed Constance, ignoring the mention of Sir John for a wonder. Indeed, for the moment, by an experience which is not uncommon, the old love, coming back in a tide, had submerged and swallowed up the new."], [246, "234 A MORNING MIST. \" If she liked to take the trouble, you have the com fort of thinking as how you gave it to her,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, dryly. \" I ain't sure that Martha Hobbs would give it to me.\" \"And I'm certain sure,\" Mrs. Hobbs told herself, with a slight toss of her head, \"if her were such a ninny, I'd never take the rule over a girl, not in no such thing like Miss West. Not even to let the girl manage her clothes, and her a woman growed ! Whatever could be the meaning of such behaviour in that there Miss West, as were a fine woman in her way, and is now as dead and gone, though she is lying stretched on her own bed in one of them rooms, as if she had departed this life hundreds of years agone ? What could she have been thinking on to keep a girl as she was main fond on, like a child in long clothes ? But la ! I'm rough on the shiftless creature as is Joe's fancy, Mattie's likewise, and I heard that little monkey, Bessie, crying her eyes out in the nursery, because her pretty lady's friend were took away from her to be put in the black hole ! What they all see in this lass it passes me to make out, except skin-deep pink-and- white cheeks, set off by one of your towsled heads of yellow hair, as would have been scorned for being next door to red in my young days. It is a colour as is more becoming to a man, which a body may see in her brother's complexion. But she has a heap of airs and graces which, being a poor lad, he hasn't the spirit to display. Ah, well 1 I must be a hard old woman, since Joe \u2014 poor, soft-hearted, deluded lad ! \u2014 trusted I'd be kind, and her roses are all washed out with tears this 'ere morning, while I daresay she hasn't spared a thought to her hair since she pulled it down last night.\" \" Miss Beauchamp,\" Mrs. Hobbs said aloud, \" I ain't mannerly, but I mean well. You said a little while ago that if your father had been spared for you to wait upon, or your mother had left a helpless babby to you, bidding you keep it, you mightn't have sat here, a-countin' of your fingers and a-pityin' of yourself. May I be so bold as to remind you as you are doing nothing for your good"], [247, "\"THAT DREADFUL WOMAN.\" 235 brother : you are leaving everything to him, as is a man, and has spent the best part of his life in Indy, where he may have seed battles, and yet know nought of the trouble death makes in a household ? More than that, you, if anybody, mun know best what were Miss West's wishes on certain points. It ain't respectful to her, as is no longer here to express her wishes, not to consult her in the only way it can be done, as to the last duties as has to be paid. I've took the liberty to get the keys of the linen-press from your maid, Lindy\u2014 drat them fine names for working girls ; they are like feathers in the fools' hats, and fans between their greasy fingers \u2014 I've done so that whatever was forgotten or passed over has been see'd to. She is lying like the lady she was in life ; you needn't take no thought for that, but it is your part to see as the rest as is left to be done for her is done decent and in order, as a proper, particular woman like her would have wished it.\" Mrs. Hobbs had struck the right chord at last. Con stance stood up, tried to smooth her hair, and to pull her morning gown straight, then walked with uncertain steps to the dining room, which had been dedicated to Sir John's use, where he was sitting with pen-and-ink, various scrawled sheets of paper and small calculations before him. He wore a perplexed air, and rose eagerly to put chairs for the ladies, and to take them into his counsel. Constance strove to still her fluttering heart, and to keep her tears from bursting forth anew \u2014 with a forlorn sense that men disliked the sight of tears, when her glance fell on the vacant place at the head of the table, which nobody happened to fill. If only she had been alone with her brother, if he had been less eager to clutch at the relief and support derived from a stranger's presence, from the company of a person so terribly un ceremonious and unvarnished in her statements ! The misfortune was that the brother and sister had not known each other all their lives, as brother and sister are wont to know each other, and had not shared many a youthful trial before this crucial one. Had the terms they were"], [248, "236 A MORNING MIST. on together resembled those which existed between Mattie and Joe Hobbs, so that Constance could have grasped Sir John's arm, laid her throbbing head on his shoulder and sobbed without apology, without think ing whether men were put out by the sight of tears, simply saying, \" Oh, John, John ! \" and knowing that he understood all, and made allowance for all, then her heart would have felt less like breaking. But all that the shock and sorrow appeared to have done was to have brought back the mutual shyness and formality of the pair's first relations, so that her brother looked at Constance disconcertedly, as if he did not know what to do with her, as if he were positively afraid of her \u2014 a poor heart-stricken girl, whose insufficiency for the simplest and commonest responsibilities of life, not to say for its dire misfortunes, Mrs. Hobbs had already demonstrated plainly and rated soundly. Constance felt limp all over, as well as wounded to the quick. Yet she was making a wonderfully brave effort to pull herself together and discuss like a rational being the sad consequences of the dreadful event which had robbed her of her second and best mother. She did not know the extent of her loss, she did not even suspect any more than Sir John in his ignorance suspected, that girls like his sister, brought up without the hardening and bracing process which is part of the experience of the working-girls with whom Mrs. Hobbs was familiar, are generally \u2014 wisely or unwisely \u2014 spared, and kept apart from such discussions as that in which Constance was now called upon to engage. Childish as she was, she set her teeth and struggled to go through with it, as soon as the new view had been presented to her, that for her to do so was a mark of respect to her dead friend. But when Mrs. Hobbs proceeded \u2014 without mincing matters, and not without the kind of grisly relish with which primitive, robust minds deal with topics from which more elaborately cultured, high-strung natures are prone to recoil, to enter into sundry details, Constance's most courageous efforts were foiled. What about the coffin ? Mrs. Hobbs inquired. Must it be of oak, or"], [249, "\"THAT DREADFUL WOMAN\" 237 would the incompetent couple to whom the arrange ments fell come to the conclusion that polished elm would do ? What about the handles, and the plate ? Of course the name and age would have to be given. Mrs. Hobbs supposed that Miss West was not behind three-score, if she was not beyond it. Not that she had ever dropped any hint to that effect, but maiden ladies, as a rule, were not over honest in owning to their years. Had not the day for the funeral better be settled at once, and then they would know what they were about ? In cases of short illness, where there had been no wasting sickness, it was not wise to put off. At this stage Constance grew so deadly white that her brother, happening to look round at her, started up in dismay. What was going to happen next ? Was Con stance about to faint ? Had she a habit of fainting which Miss West had omitted to mention to him ? What was to become of him and Constance if Mrs. Hobbs did not stand by them in the emergency ? When it came to that Mrs. Hobbs was a staff in need. She laid the girl down, with a little compunction for what had been her doing, on the sofa, out of hearing, ordered a glass of wine to forestall the cup of beef-tea which she had already told the cook to make, and forbade Constance to stir till she had swallowed both. \"I could take my Bible oath, Sir John, her hasn't swallowed bite nor sup this blessed day. You should have see'd to it \u2014 no, not you, she should have had the sense to look after both herself and you. What are women, old or young, made for I should like to know ? But there, it is clear she ain't fit to be left long to herself and to them young trollops of maids, though I ain't making no complaints again them, save it ain't in them to act without orders. An older woman is wanted at a time like this.\" In the course of the afternoon Mr. Hobbs arrived, grave and self-restrained as usual, but not the less kind on that account, and full of consideration, which con descended to the minutest particular in which he could be of service to his young neighbours, as if Mr. Hobbs had"], [250, "238 A MORNING MIST. been the idlest instead of the busiest man in the kingdom. Sir John, whose powers of observation were somewhat blunted by that long, harassing, engrossing, hand to-hand fight with poverty in a false position (there was the demoralising element), was nevertheless a man of the world, and possessed of some sense. He had a distinct perception that a Cabinet Minister would have hesitated to trespass on the great boiler-maker's time, and would have apologised for the trespass. Sir John himself stammered vainly to express his gratitude. \" Don't mention it, Sir John,\" said old Joe Hobbs, with his out-of-date politeness; \"I'm happy to have it in my power to be of any use, and so is my wife here. We should be a poor lot if it were otherwise, and should deserve to be left to ourselves in our times of trouble. You are a sort of chum of my son Joe's, if you do not mind the definition, and your sister is one of my daugh ter Mattie's young friends. Moreover, I had some trifling dealings with your late father, in addition to the fact \u2022that the poor lady who is gone so sudden did us the favour to sit down at our table not so many weeks back, and filled us all with esteem for what were evidently her admirable qualities ; so, Sir John, you may count on me and Mrs. Hobbs.\" \" I'll tell you what, Joe,\" broke in Mrs. Hobbs, \" you'll tell them at home that I mean to stop here till after the funeral. I find there's summat for me to do. Mattie can manage and do for you and the rest without me. Bid Mattie put up a parcel of things \u2014 she'll know what I want \u2014 and send them over the first thing after you get back.\" \" How can I ever thank you, Mrs. Hobbs? \" cried Sir John, with a gasp of relief, grasping her hand. \" You lay us under the deepest obligation. I am aware how much you are giving up in coming and staying here under the circumstances. I know what a state of confusion we are in \u2014 poor Miss West was at the head of everything \u2014 and what a melancholy duty it is for you to take upon yourself.\""], [251, "\"THAT DREADFUL WOMAN\" 239 \" If it wasn't a duty, Sir John, where'd be the obliga tion ? \" said Mrs. Hobbs, in her brisk way, \" and if the obligation is there, ain't I bound to discharge it? As I take it, there ain't no call for thanks \u2014 not that I ain't pleased, if you likes to have it that way. If I didn't believe as I'd be of some use, I hope I'd not go for to invite myself both to come and to stop. You don't think as I intended it for a bit of pleasure, do 'ee ? \" \"Far from it,\" said Sir John, with solemn matter-of factness. \" When poor Connie is able she must thank you better than I can.'' \" You does it main well yourself \u2014 a deal the better of the two, not to flatter you, young gentleman. But I don't want no thanks; I ain't here for thanks,\" insisted the Beauchamps' uncompromising benefactress. During tbe next two or three strange woful days it hung very evenly in the balance \u2014 a feather could have weighed down the scale, one way or other \u2014 whether Mrs. Hobbs's rough and despotic yet disinterested and unfailing care and kindness would or would not break down the prejudices of both women, destroy the enmity between them, and establish in its stead something of the friendly confidence and well-nigh affectionate intimacy which had sprung up as rapidly as if it were the growth of a night, between two persons so unlike as Sir John and Mrs. Hobbs. Constance could not help feeling a little faint consolation in the fact that a woman of Mrs. Hobbs's experience was in the house. The girl had no other female friend to appeal to \u2014 to come between her and all the trying difficulties of the situation. Not that Mrs. Hobbs saw anything to be gained in sparing Constance such exertion as she could make, or in humouring her in her desire to avoid encountering strangers. The elder woman was constantly urging the younger to \" smart her fingers,\" in Mrs. Hobbs's phrase, in writing notes, granting interviews to messengers from the draper's shop and the dressmaker's in Dorrington, in giving commissions and anticipating changes. Mrs. Hobbs compelled Constance to select her own mourning and that of the servants, though Mattie Hobbs had"], [252, "240 A MORNING MIST. offered to do everything of the kind that was necessary if Constance wished it. It was only the fear of the girl's breaking down which kept Mrs. Hobbs from urging her further. It was a matter of real regret in the matron's eyes, that Constance could not be got \u2014 had not the requisite qualifications, indeed \u2014 to make a part of her mourning with her own hands. \" A thimble on the finger, and a needle flying out and in would be as good, and a deal better, than a doctor's prescription. There ain't anything so helpful to a heavy heart as a busy hand. I've scoured every pot and pan in the house at Willesden day after day sooner than sit down idle. To do summat for your neighbour ain't bad as physic for your own pain, but there ain't always a neighbour at hand to do something for, and there ain't a many women as would cross their own doorsteps so long as the dead were still within their walls, or the turf on their new-made graves still welted. It do have come to a pretty pass when a girl is too fine a lady to run up the seams of a house-gown, or hem its tail. I'd think little of Martha Hobbs, with her learning and her manners, if her could not make a gown for herself or me at a pinch. Making a wreath to lay on the coffin \u2014 tut ! tut ! that ain't the same thing ; that ain't taking her out of herself, and letting her feel herself of use in the world, as long as she stays in it. I ain't again a flower or two as a man or woman liked to pick and put in a button hole or a waistband, when they were here, laid on a grave, or what is better, planted to take its chance of the sun and rain, nigh hand But them cartloads of flowers, and crowns, and crosses are fair folly, and a senseless frippery of fashion.\" Yet when the awe of death was in the house Mrs. Hobbs formed a refuge. Constance would awake, shivering with the sense of irreparable loss and indefi nite fear, in her room, which had grown so lonely and was so dreary, overshadowed by the thought of what lay in another room not far apart \u2014 that which was not Miss West, but had been her representative and ' embodiment while she dwelt among them, before she had left them"], [253, "\"THAT DREADFUL WOMAN.\" 241 and gone to that higher, holier region where she might still be watching over her beloved charge. But oh ! what would Constance not have given to know, see, and feel her life-long friend by her side on equal terms, a human being like herself ? It might be selfish to grudge her the blessed assurance, instead of the glad hope of eternal life and that closer communion with their Heavenly Father and Divine Elder Brother which Constance knew the good woman had aspired to, and taught her to aspire to, but grief would not be grief if it had not its selfish ele ment. Then when poor Constance was quivering and cowering in her tender young human sorrow and weak ness, it was some comfort to know that Mrs. Hobbs had caused a bed to be put up in the adjoining room, of which the door stood open, and that there the vigilant woman, who had elected not to lose sight of the girl in the mean time, lay within call. Constance could distinguish occasional puffing snorts, which might stand for protest ing snores. It was too horrible to have a sense of amusement steal over her in such mournful moments, but it was incongruously odd to be conscious of a sense of protection and human companionship from the sound of a vulgar snore. On the other hand, if Constance gave way to a fit of stifled sobbing, as she woke up more fully to a knowledge of her changed lot, she would hear one or two bustling movements in the next room, which were explained by the speedy appearance on the scene of Mrs. Hobbs in her dressing-gown and slippers, and that antiquated piece of attire a night-cap, a stiffly starched, snowy nightcap, in which the wearer, with her still fresh colour, her dark eyes, and her tidily braided and rolled up dark hair just streaked with grey, looked quite young and comely, and startlingly like her daughter Mattie, as Constance had once seen Mattie show herself in her nurse's cap. \" You must not take on so, Miss Beau champ,\" Mrs. Hobbs would say authoritatively in a half scolding, half-soothing voice. \"It ain't right, it ain't fair to your brother, or yourself, or to her as is gone. I am certain sure she taught you to submit to God's will 16"], [254, "242 A MORNING MIST. and control yourself . Here! Swallow this,\" presenting a glass of sal volatile, or a plate of jelly, as one would present a pistol; \"lie down again, and keep quiet, and may-happen you'll fall into a sound sleep.\" When Constance sought to steal away unobserved, and take her last farewell of the coffin which contained the mortal remains of her friend, as she knelt by it, and laid he r head down, feeling as if she could never raise it again, it was Mrs. Hobbs who lifted her up bodily, and forcibly drew her away. \"Her ain't there \u2014 her is like the Lord, risen, in a sense. Better look for her in the sky than bewail her in that black-palled box.\" It was Mrs. Hobbs who drove with Constance and Sir John in the mourning coach, which, with one or two private carriages \u2014 the Hobbses' carriage conspicuous among the others \u2014 were sent more cut of compliment to Sir John Beauchamp than out of regard for the dead woman. They formed the modest cortege that followed the hearse to Rivermeadows Churchyard. After the coffin was carried to its last resting-place, and the mourners fell into their place, it was still Mrs. Hobbs who, with Constance's slim arm tucked under her sturdy one, kept the girl's trembling limbs from giving way, as earth was given back to earth, and dust to dust. Constance, absorbed as she was in her bereavement, was not such an ingrate or an idiot as not to share Sir John's conviction that Mrs. Hobbs had put herself very much about and done a great deal to be of assistance to her. But the conviction had not the same effect on the sister that it had on the brother. It oppressed Constance with the burden of a debt which she did not believe she could ever pay. Besides, the scales had turned the wrong way. Mrs. Hobbs, in her thoroughness, had over done her part. She had made Constance feel as if Maisonette had grown into a gaol, of which Mrs. Hobbs had constituted herself the keeper. True, Constance had been used to constant, unslumbering supervision over her from the day when Miss West had arrived at Fairfields as governess to the little daughter of Sir Randal and Lady Beauchamp. But the old, warranted"], [255, "\" THA T DREADFUL WOMAN.\" 243 customary control exercised by the woman who had brought her up, to whom Constance had looked up from childhood, whom she had inevitably grown to resemble in many respects, was a totally different thing from the surveillance which Mrs. Hobbs chose to establish. The last was always arbitrary, and sometimes downright rude, however well-meant it might be, and it was the work of a woman with whom Constance thought she had not two ideas in common. She felt as if she were hunted down, as if her privacy were invaded and her self respect outraged. Mrs. Hobbs would not behave in the same manner to her own daughter, with whom she had a mother's right to interfere. She had respect for Martha Hobbs, but she held Constance Beauchamp \u2014 who, after all, was as far removed from Martha Hobbs as the house of Beauchamp was from the race of Hobbs \u2014 as a poor, childish, foolish being, over whom she was at liberty to practise her remarkable talent for domineering and tyrannizing, Sorrow is a sickness of the mind, as fevers and con sumptions are diseases of the body. If it does not numb every nerve, it is apt to set them all on edge, and reduce their hapless victim to the last degree of irritability, of which she is mortally ashamed as an affront to what ought to be her utter indifference to all sublunary con cerns. Before the day of Miss West's funeral, Constance had begun to count the hours and minutes till she should be free, till Mrs. Hobbs's erect, square figure, and trim, scrimp draperies \u2014 -to which she had taken the most violent aversion \u2014 should vanish from the Beauchamp horizon, and Constance herself be left to mourn and pine her heart away unnoticed and unchecked."], [256, "CHAPTER XX. AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. Miss West had survived nearly all her relations, and the few who were left were in the colonies. From her more distant kindred, and early friends, her devotion to the Beauchamp family had served to sever her entirely. In the absence of any other representatives to undertake the task, Sir John prepared, in the company of a Dorrington lawyer whom Miss West had employed, to look over the deceased lady's papers, and act as her executor in his search for a will, or for any statement of her affairs and expression of her wishes. It had appeared a very simple proceeding to start with, but he had made a discovery which filled him with dismay, and altered the whole aspect of his own and his sister's future. Poor Sir John had been tolerably well buffeted by the blasts of fortune in a career which from the beginning had been steep and uphill work, without much credit to the man who pursued it, or any hope to cheer his heart beyond that of a rigid routine, and a series of hair-breadth escapes from worse disasters, a close-fisted, dispiriting, single combat with fate to the end. But the last subtle stroke dealt by what looked like a malignant destiny took him unawares. There was a will of some years' standing bequeathing all that had belonged to Miss West to her dear pupil Constance Beauchamp ; but the deed was hardly more than an affectionate form, seeing that its deviser had little or nothing to leave behind her. It seemed that all which the late Sir Randal Beauchamp had been able to do for those connected with him was in the shape of the annuity which he had insisted on securing"], [257, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 245 \"to Miss West. He had been sanguine and misled, a? he had always been in money matters, so that, contrary ;to his expectations, practically nothing had come to Constance from the remains of her father's patrimony. There had been no marriage settlement on the second Lady Beauchamp, so that this mode of outwitting pro bable creditors on the behalf of probable children of the marriage had not existed. As a matter of fact, Constance Beauchamp had been living all these years with Miss West in place of Miss West's living with Constance. She had been dependent on her old governess, literally living off her not too liberal allowance, with the excep tion of the small subsidy which Sir John had managed to pay towards his sister's maintenance. Nay, in addi- tion to supporting Constance, Miss West had found herself called upon to quarter Sir John, who had seen fit still farther to trespass on her limited resources. Miss West \u2014in what Sir John, in his present mortifica tion and vexation, for he was proud and honest in his poverty-stricken gentility, felt inclined to call false delicacy and misplaced generosity \u2014 had kept silence on this reversal of position, where the children of her original benefactor were concerned. Certainly she had deluded herself with regard to Sir John's mother's fortune, and the amount he had inherited from his maternal grand- father, though she had made only the smallest appeal to him for Constance's benefit on these grounds. It appeared that she had determined to look on her annuity as intended for her pupil's use as well as for her own, and it had sufficed for the wants of two gentle women who had lived in strict economy and retirement. She had looked forward to Sir John's coming home, making his sister's acquaintance, and taking her up \u2014 -as her birth on her father's side entitled her to be brought forward in society. Miss West had relied on Sir John as the gentleman and man of honour she had known him to be, and as the man of tolerable means which she had erroneously supposed him to be, to make an ultimate provision for Constance, since the annuity lapsed on Miss West's death. If she had laboured under an error"], [258, "246 A MORNING MIST. as to Sir John's means, he had also been in a fog in. reference to the provision realised for Constance. The process of mutual enlightenment had only begun when,. on the night of his arrival at Maisonette, he had candidly admitted to his hostess the smallness of his income. He might have seen for himself then how the information had surprised and distressed her. There was a letter begun and half-finished, addressed to Sir John, in Miss West's desk, of which he took pos session. It had been written within the last ten days, after she had been told by Dr. Mason of the critical. state of her health. \"Dear Sir John,\" \u2014 Miss West had written \u2014 \"lam disturbed in my mind by what I now fear was a lament able lack of foresight on my part, together with a woman's usual tendency to leap to a conclusion. At the time of your father's death, when your sister Con stance passed entirely under my care, and when I found there was no adequate portion for her, it was equally my duty and my pleasure to provide for her out of the annuity which Sir Randal had so generously settled on me. But I suffered myself to remain to a great extent . in the dark with regard to your circumstances, which I imagined to be much more flourishing than they are. It did not seem my place to investigate them, as I cam understand that the peculiar relations of the family, and the length of time which passed before everything was arranged, prevented you from ascertaining exactly how Constance stood as to money matters. I applied to you as I never would have done, if I had known everything. I applied to you when Constance was growing a big girl, to help me to keep up an establishment which should not be altogether unworthy of her father's daughter, and of you as the representative of the family. You responded so promptly, though you told me you could not do much, that I was again deceived. You will' forgive me for writing without ceremony at this crisis \u2014 I had heard that parsimony was as marked an attri bute of your mother's family as prodigality was of your"], [259, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 247 father's. I ask you to pardon me for the inference. If I had known how hampered you were, I would have brought up your sister differently. I might have bought the goodwill of a school \u2014 these enterprises are not always failures, when I came to Maisonette, I might have taken Indian children, I might have started some thing, which if it had succeeded, she might have carried on when I was gone from her in the course of nature ; or I might have had her trained to work for herself. That sounds strange even now7, when I think of Sir Randal and Fairfields. But it is much commoner for girls in a good position in the present day than it was when I was young. They seem to do for pleasure what my contemporaries and I did from necessity. There is Miss Hobbs \u2014 she is not in your sister's rank, of course, but she is the daughter of a very rich man, who can supply her with every luxury. She has the entree into the best society, I find ; and nobody can deny that she is not only personally exceedingly attractive, she has the manners and feelings of a lady. Yet I believe she can do anything, and everything, from reading the Classics and solving problems, w7hich I never knew any woman except a schoolmaster's daughter do, from painting, and playing the most difficult music, to nursing in an hospital, and making Dorcas garments like a born sempstress. If her father were ruined and she were left destitute to-morrow she could earn her living in half-a-dozen ways. She owns to having friends who earn their living. She would have friends among high and low in half the countries in Europe, even in South America. She once told me of a school-fellow of hers who had settled with her brother on a ranchc, and Miss Hobbs and her brother visited the other pair, and were never so happy in their lives. I daresay that was unin tentional exaggeration ; but I am learning something in my old age. If I had brought up my poor Constance in that fashion, she would have been safe, whatever befell, even if she had not shown such capabilities of enterprise, such powers of endurance and versatility of character, as belong to Miss Hobbs \u2014 I daresay she"], [260, "248 A MORNING MIST. takes her energy and versatility of mind from the working-class to which her father and mother originally belonged. It is too late to indulge in vain regrets, when I have reason to fear \u2014 from Dr. Mason's report, made to me to-day, and from my own feelings \u25a0\" There the letter broke off, for the fears of the writer had been only too soon realised. The will which left to Constance Beauchamp the personal effects of the testator and the furniture of Maisonette \u2014 for the house and grounds had been merely rented by Miss West \u2014 was all which stood between the girl and a state of entire de pendence and desolate penury. The value of the little legacy was not more than a couple of hundred pounds, from which the expenses of the recent funeral, servants' wages, etc., etc., had to be deducted. \" Good Heavens ! What am I to do with Constance ? \" poor burdened Sir John asked himself, as he faced the calamity. He had been as rash and reckless as Miss West in her last words had called herself. Yet he had always considered that he was a prudent, cautious fellow, if he had not more brilliant abilities. He had taken for granted that out of the final wreck of his father's pro perty, which had left nothing for the son who had a profession, such as it was, some shreds and pickings had been saved for the young, unportioned daughter, and that it was on the income derived from these funds, and not solely on Miss West's annuity, that his sister and her old governess had kept house. Constance was but Sir John's half-sister, the daughter of a mother whom, so long as his own mother had lived, so long as he had resided in his grandfather's house, he had heard curtly referred to as \"that woman.\" He had not so much as seen his step-sister till he returned from India this summer. In all his troubles, concern for her welfare had not vexed him. But he had not felt aggrieved when Miss West had applied to him for an addition to Constance's \" income,\" without the explana tion that this meant Miss West's annuity, for he had not seen how he could refuse with a good grace, though he"], [261, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 249 had felt the tax a hardship. He could almost have wished that he had never come home, never made his sister's acquaintance. In that case he might have coolly suggested to her, in the present strait, to look up her mother's relations, and try if any of them were in a posi tion to befriend her. Or, if that expedient failed \u2014 as he had every reason to believe it would fail \u2014 to propose that she should try what she could do to work for her living, without expecting more than the few drops she was already draining from the parched channel of bis resources. If she could not she ought to, and that was all that he would have had to say to her. But all the time Sir John made these reflections he had a sheepish consciousness that he would not have written the hard sentence. Above all he believed that he had not paid too dearly for the nearest approach to the restful peace and kindly affection of a home which he had ever known, even in his unhappy mother's life time. He could not bear to relinquish his sense of kin ship, to give up his right to know7, and be fond of the pretty young creature who had had such innocent, extravagant faith in him, and tender regard for him. Why, even to the most amiable and friendly of his brother officers' wives, he had never been more than a dry-haired subject, an inoffensive fellow, older than his years, who must have a heart somewhere, since he was good to the children, who was to be trusted for his harm- lessness, who was also to be pitied for his isolation ; while to the younger women he was dull and slow, an out-and-out detrimental, soon to be a kill-joy. It was only to this little sister of his, to whom he had been so recently introduced, that he was a conquering hero, a peerless prince. How eagerly these two poor women, old and young, had welcomed him, when he intruded with- out compunction upon their quiet routine, turned it topsy-turvy and lived off what he knew now was their far from ample means. His face flushed, his eyes grew moist at the recollection. He could never wish to undo altogether what had been done. He must stand by his sister; she ought to be his first consideration;"], [262, "250 A MORNING MIST. and he was a mean and miserable curmudgeon not to rejoice that he had her to consider \u2014 he who had only had himself to look after hitherto, and he had not found that stupid, sordid self a very profitable object to devote his life to. Poor, dear Connie, sitting all alone aud dis consolate in the drawing-room, from which Mrs. Hobbs, admirable soul ! worth her weight in gold, had departed \u2014 Connie was alone, because he could not take her into his counsels yet, and he dreaded to discover what she knew of the double loss which had befallen her, or to be forced to answer the difficult questions she might put to him. But something must be thought of at once. In the old days when there was no mention of \"fast people,\" and yet the world in general was less delicate-minded and scrupulous than the better half of it is now, the ques tion would have decided itself easily enough. The couple of hundreds or so which came to Constance would pay her passage money to India, and furnish her with an outfit, while her own lovely face would do the rest, if he could make up his mind to take his sister out with him, and trust to her being immediately bid for, and bought in what remained of the marriage mart. For it was clear that the slightly-supplemented pay which was barely enough for the requirements of one could not be stretched to supply the wants of two. But Sir John, in the middle of his former struggles and embarrassments, had been in the habit of indemni fying himself for his disadvantages by inveighing against the last remnants of a course to which he had an invincible repugnance. All the softening accessories with which it might be invested to other men would be absent in his case. It would be in evidence against him that he could only be bringing out his sister to get her married, since his bare quarters and frugal habits forbade the probability of his indulging the superfluity of the company of a female relative on a long visit, or for a permanency. Even his most intimate associates were not aware that he had a sister, and to account for her existence he must enter into"], [263, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 251 explanations which were awkward, to say the least, and might revive the old family scandals still more to Con stance's discredit than to his own, guiltless as she was of any offence against society. He had no woman friend at any of the stations, not even such an one as he had made in Mrs. Hobbs, to whom, inexperienced as he was in girls, and with Constance very young for her years, he could commit his sister till she had time to look about her and make up her mind. Otherwise she might be called on to decide, without a breathing-space, the most momentous question in a man's or woman's life. Further, he had recently heard that his regiment was likely to be sent, for an indefinite time, to a small, out-of-the-way, unhealthy station, at which no lady could find decent accommodation if she tried. Altogether, Sir John did not think that he could go through the farce of taking Constance out to India, on the pretence of making a home for her there. The only other mode of disposing of the difficulty was for him to sell out. On the price of his commission the couple might vegetate in cheap lodgings or boarding-houses at home or abroad. With this view of the case reaction, according to its wont, set in. He had believed himself heart-sick of the make-shifts, make-believes, and barren self-denials of his life in the service \u2014 of its dreary tread mill round of drill, parade and mess, transfers here and transfers there, which never really altered the situation, but only executed fatiguing varieties on its leading features, with a half-hearted pursuit of art and natural history as an excuse for abstaining from well-worn station gaieties and sporting expeditions, which his encumbered finances could not afford. But now that he told himself he must leave the past behind him, turning his back on his former existence, it flashed upon him that those drawbacks had but been the accidents of his professional career. He had honestly, if languidly, liked his trade of soldiering, could he but have followed it an unfettered, well-equipped man. He had started on it with a boy's hopes, which, however dim and distant, he had not quite forgotten. He had still looked forward \u2014 however faint"], [264, "252 A MORNING MIST. and far the outlook \u2014 to something happening which would break the chains that bound him. He might hit at last on a lengthened period of active service \u2014 of which he had only known the shortest spells \u2014 in which, though he had no special taste for bloodshed, he might yet have the opportunity of distinguishing himself in a way, of being of use in the world, of winning solid advantages as well as showy laurels. He was not a donkey, though he might have grown to look like one. He knew, diffident though he was tempted to be, that with anything approaching to an independent command, any power given him of rising above his drags and impediments, he would vindicate his fair abilities, his capacity for taking pains, his reserve force of courage and endurance. But if be sold out, he should relinquish his last hope, he should close the door against the remotest chance of retrieving his misfortunes. He would become a wanderer on the face of the earth, without occupation or interest, a money-grubber without money to grub, a wretched miser devoid of treasure, a monomaniac and misan thropist, a broken-hearted man draining out the dregs of a wasted life. It was hard to decide, and the prospect was far from exhilarating either way, while something must be settled at once. For poor Miss West's funeral expenses had already eaten a hole in what account she kept in the principal bank at Dorrington, the establishment at Maisonette must be broken up, what remained of the lease got rid of, and the furniture sold, with the least possible delay. For such time as Sir John's leave lasted, whether he fixed on going back to India or selling out, he and Constance must be satisfied with humbler quarters. In the first necessity of disposing of the house and furniture, Sir John naturally walked over to Kings meadows to seek the advice of his friends there. He found only Mrs. Hobbs and young Joe at home, and the smaller audience seemed to render it more feasible to him to do his errand. He did it simply, and with little in clination to mince matters. Mrs. Hobbs, who had"], [265, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL 253 alw*ays sympathy to spare for tangible misfortunes, lis tened with so much interest and indulgence that he was led on, in spite of his reserve, to refer to his uncertainty as to his sister's destination. Sir John was so engrossed with setting forth even the briefest sketch of his perplexities that he failed to notice the disturbance and distress of one of his listeners, though, as a rule, Joe Hobbs in a state of high pres sure from agitation was not a spectacle to be overlooked. It was not till Sir John had taken leave of the mis tress of the house and was preparing to return to Maisonette, escorted part of the way by his host for the time, that the visitor became alive to a particular fact. His companion had something to say to him, something which was sticking fast in his throat, and driving him nearly frantic with confusion and desperation. \" Sir John,\" began the unhappy man, \" in any other circumstances it would be utterly inexcusable in me to speak to you as I am going to do \u2014 I mean in reference to the shortness of our acquaintance, and to the sad event which has just happened at Maisonette.\" \"Eh, what? \" exclaimed Sir John, more sharply than usual, startled by the extreme seriousness, and, at the same time, the flurry, of the speaker's manner. A horrified suspicion flashed across Sir John's mind that Joe Hobbs was on the point of offering to lend him money \u2014 only he himself knew how acceptable it would be. But the one humiliation he had succeeded in escaping, by end less sacrifices on his part, was debt, and well did he know that if he borrowed to any extent from the boiler-maker's son, it was utterly improbable that he should ever meet the obligation. Nevertheless, the temptation to run the risk was so strong that he spoke sharply, under the force he put upon himself to resist it. \"I am afraid you -will think it altogether unjustifiable,\" went on Joe, striking fiercely with a small switch which he happened to hold at the tall shoots of the avenue dog roses, on which the long hips were beginning to show in a fine, full orange-colour. \" If there had been no question of your quitting Maisonette immediately, and"], [266, "\u25a0254 A MORNING MIST. perhaps carrying Miss Beauchamp out to India with you, or of your taking such an extreme step as selling out for your sister's sake, I hope I know better what is due both to her and to you than to intrude my feelings, not only prematurely, but at such an unpropitious time.\" The truth was dawning on Sir John. He had enter. tained a suspicion before now that young Hobbs was \u2014 what should he say ? \u2014 taken with Connie, and in a fair way to become \" sweet,\" or \" spoony,\" or whatever was the slang phraseology of the day, upon her. But poor Sir John, who was not, and had never looked upon him self as likely to be, a marrying man, in the humdrum, care-worn round of his small economies, had always felt that he had small concern with one of the subjects which is apt to bulk considerably in barrack-life and barrack-room gossip when the officers are bachelors, and in age a little under thirty. He had, honourably enough, steered clear of objectless flirtation, and he had equally steered clear of enterprising, calculating matrons and maidens, till they had ended by regarding him as good for an escort or a partner \u2014 somewhat preoccupied and listless \u2014 when nobody better offered. But for anything else, good lack ! the subaltern of most questionable ante cedents, the man risen from the ranks, was a more hopeful prey than Sir John. As a matter of course, then, Sir John was inexperienced in such questions. With more leisure than usual, and entirely disengaged on his own account, he had merely arrived at an inkling of the truth, which had amused him slightly. Constance was running some danger of having a swain ; that swain was already tolerably \" gone,\" considering the time generally allowed for the operation, and possibly he was on the road to be com pletely \" done for.\" But the elder man, of little experience and no great guile, had put small weight on the impression he had received, and when he began to comprehend the truth that it might be of the last importance, the turning-point in more than one history, he was in a manner thunder struck. He was the last man to help Joe Hobbs out"], [267, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 255 with his tale. All that tbe listener did was to turn his high, handsome head, and, blinking the grey eyes dazzled by the prospect opening out before them, to stare some what stonily and disconcertingly at the stammering orator. \" I do not imagine for au instant that your sister would be inclined to listen favourably to my suit, even if she did me the honour to \u2014 to condescend so far, no, not for many a day. But my consciousness of the depth and the unalterable nature of my attachment seems to warrant me in speaking of it to you, as her brother and guardian, and in asking you to take it into consideration at this juncture,\" struggled on Joe, with a mixture of native humility, and of his intrepidity in pursuing an end. Sir John had found time to recover himself. \" My dear fellow-,\" he said, with his quiet courtesy and the candour which, in all his shifts aud subterfuges, he had, strange to say, never lost, \" a cat may look at a king, which is far from a proper way of expressing myself in the circumstances, I know ; still, let it stand. My sister could only count herself honoured by your preference were you as poor as she is; while, of course, the answer to your proposal would rest with her. As it is, I am afraid it would be a desperately unequal match \u2014 unequal because of your father's wealth, I mean,\" he hastened to add. He had seen Joe's expressive face cloud over, and he was hanging on the words addressed to him as if the man who said them, instead of feeling himself hope lessly handicapped, had been the haughty arbiter of half the destinies in Europe. \" So far as I am concerned I should have no objection to having you for my brother in-law; on the contrary, allow me to tell you,\" con tinued Sir John, with his customary sedateness and deliberation, \" I have heard nothing of you and your family which does not redound to your credit, and both Constance and I have received from you a quite un believable amount of kindness, considering that we only made your acquaintance this summer.\""], [268, "256 A MORNING MIST. \"I am eternally obliged to you, Beauchamp, for saying so,\" cried Joe, in his unbounded gratitude, making a dive at Sir John's long slim hand, and squeezing it as if it were in a vice. \" You are nothing of the kind,\" said Sir John, free ing his crushed fingers and shaking them ruefully; \" and remember, Hobbs, I must hear what your father and mother have to say before there is more of this. Even after that Constance is to be taken into account \u2014 it is her matter, after all; it is for her to say yes or no.\" \" Yes, certainly, I understand,\" said Joe Hobbs, em phatically ; \" she is not to be committed to anything. I should never have thought\u2014 indeed, Beauchamp, I should not \u2014 of hurrying her in any way, or of intruding on her mourning by suggesting ideas which must neces sarily jar upon her, to say the least ; but I was led to believe from what you said to my mother that you were on the point of taking a step which might be irreparable. With what was in my mind I felt bound to anticipate it.\" \" And so you came forward,\" said Sir John, with laconic prosaicness. \" It seems to me you were perfectly justi fied. I do not see how any beggar in earnest could have done otherwise. Now, don't assure me you are in ear nest. I don't do you the injustice of doubting it, but don't forget your father and mother.\" \"I can answer for my father and mother,'' said Joe, with honest pride, and he was right in his boast. The traditions of the working classes, by which his father and mother still held in so many respects, would have been enough in themselves to have prevented their disputing Joe's right to marry when, and where, and whom he would. He was a partner in his father's business, and old Joe would no more deny him his fair share in the profits of the concern than he would have refused his men their wages. Young Joe was welcome to set up a separate establishment when he chose. His father and mother might not be able to help having different views for him. Wealth might crave more wealth. His father might have preferred that he should not marry till he"], [269, "AN OPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 257 got into Parliament aud made himself listened to there. His mother might have a small opinion of a useless fine lady like Miss Beauchamp. Even Mattie, though she had a fancy for the girl, might have held her a poor partner for her brother ; but it wa3 for him to judge : that was practically the tenet of the working class from which the Hobbses had sprung. Nowhere is the inde pendence of men and women in the fundamental ques tion of marriage more literally acknowledged than amongst the sons and daughters of the people. \" I don't mean that I can pledge myself for their opinion,\" said Joe, again, \" but I am sure that they will not deny my title to act for myself in any matter that concerns me so nearly ; and when they see I have made up my mind they will put no obstacle in the way of my marriage. It is not in my father to be otherwise than liberal and forbearing, even if he had cause for forbear ance instead of every reason to be satisfied. My mother, though she speaks her mind pretty plainly, I must con fess,\" broke off Joe, with a cheery laugh which had neither uneasiness nor arricre pensee in it, \" is the very best-hearted woman I know, unless it may be my sister Mattie. Forgive me for praising my own people.\" \" You are lucky in your relations,\" said Sir John, unable to keep back a suspicion of dryness in his tone, and yet with an undercurrent of repressed regret. \" I only hope you are correct in your estimate of their amiable frame of mind, for otherwise, it will be, excuse me, horribly awkward for all parties.\" \"You think I ought to have spoken to them first,\" said Joe, with quick perception. \"Well, perhaps so, but you see I was so taken aback by what you were saying to my mother.\" \" And you are a dreadfully impulsive sinner,\" said Sir John, coolly. \" Yes, I admit that I think you have been rather rash, but I can make allowance for you,\" he ended, graciously. \" I cannot be sorry for making a clean breast of it to you, you have been so good to me,\" said poor Joe, as impulsive and incoherent in his gratitude as ever; \" you 17"], [270, "258 A MORNING MIST. may do me the justice of believing that, when I consider her deserts in contrast to mine.\" \" Stop that,\" protested Sir John, with good-natured impatience. \" My dear fellow, even I can guess what a man in your position is likely to say, and to say it would render the discussion interminable. I don't for a moment doubt your sincerity \u2014 don't frown at me like that \u2014 I will even go so far as to say that though Constance is my sister \u2014 and yet, strange to say, we had not met three months ago \u2014 I think you have some little ground for y*our infatuation. I have eyes to see she is very pretty, and I am convinced she is a dear, good little girl If she is only as kind and trustful a soul to you as she has been to me during our not very long acquaintance you will not be greatly to be pitied. You may go farther and fare worse. Her head is a little in the air; she has not much more knowledge of the world than a baby has. But I suppose, after all, she is not much less wise than the run of country-bred girls who have led very retired lives. There are other drawbacks,\" said Sir John, with a momentary hesitation, his face, from w*hich the bronze of a long stay in a hot climate was beginning to fade, reddening a little. \" However ignorant she may be of them, poor girl ! I cannot pre tend to be unacquainted with them ; but, at least, they were no fault of hers, and if you and your family are willing to overlook them \" \" Say no more, Sir John,\" Joe interrupted him, hotly. \" Only a brute and a fool could lay the errors of others to her charge ; any man on earth, a prince of the blood, might consider himself honoured by being connected with her and you.\" \"With me?\" exclaimed Sir John, raising his eye brows comically. \" Why, I have never had much occasion to count it a comfort, not to say an honour, to be connected with myself. Let it be ; we shall throw me into the bargain ; the rest goes without saying when a man is in your condition.\""], [271, "CHAPTER XXI. \"YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" When Sir John at last parted from young Joe Hobbs, the brother could hardly tell whether he was more relieved or aggrieved by the sudden solution of his difficulty. He was free again, as when he came to Maisonette. Constance would be unexceptionably provided for, without any more wearing anxiety and screwing self-denial on his part : but he would have lost his little sister. The only family tie which had begun to twine itself warmly and sweetly round his stripped and starved heart was wrenched from him, and given to the lucky fellow who had everything \u2014 a host of adorable relations, according to himself, wealth without stint, every advantage from a far-reaching education, a business which he liked, and was not ashamed to take a strong pleasure in, no end of in terests, social and philanthropic \u2014 only the troubles of his neighbours to trouble him. And he was to have Constance, too ! Sir John knew that he would be worse than a mad man to decline the alliance. He did not underrate the claims of his birth and title, his position as an officer and gentleman to the same extent to himself, as he was forced to do to Constance in order to keep her imagination within bounds, aud bring her down some where near her level, poor child ! On the contrary, he was not without finding a forlorn refuge in the middle of his worries in the consciousness that he was the main representative of the old Beauchamps of Fair fields, who had for many generations been a power in."], [272, "260 A MORNING MIST. the place which now knew them no more. But he was still quite sane enough to be aware that the Beau champs, at the bsst, had been by no msans sans peur et sans reprocha. Poor Constance had her special draw back. In her unconscious parity and delicacy of mind she was the daughter of a dishonoured mother, to whom reparation had been made, it is true ; but repara tion could not wipe out the disgraceful past, or prevent a slur of infamy extending even to her lawfully born child. No ; there was no possibility of denying that the advantages of a marriage between Joe Hobbs and Constance Beauchamp were immensely on the girl's side. Then as Sir John pondered, and let himself be reckless and wasteful under the exigencies of the moment in smoking a succession of second-rate cigars, while he paced about among the seeding, withering flowers of Maisonette, which had been in the perfection of their bloom when he arrived in England, another thought flashed across his deliberate brain \u2014 a thought which he at first put from him with some energy, but it returned again and again, till it ended in laying fast hold of him. Why should young Hobbs have everything ? A fair ex change was no robbery. Why should not he and his consent that Mattie Hobbs should come to Sir John, if Constance was to go to Joe ? Mattie, in her womanly perfection of gifts and graces, was laden, in addition, with more material, more substantial benefits. No more drawing apart from his kind, and hiding his head to escape sharing obligations which he could not discharge and would not leave undischarged. No more shy, awkward evasions. No more hard, close calculations, and narrow balancing of ways and means. The ability to move unshackled among men, to indulge his honest tastes and blameless inclinations, to grow a genial senior instead of appearing a carping, constrained martinet, a help, support, and pillar of strength to the juniors in his regiment, among his soldiers, among the natives, whom he should have the leisure and heart to study. In the past his whole strength, his whole mind, had been expended on making"], [273, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 261 both ends meet, on averting an open exposure of his poverty, on holding himself aloof from every engagement and enterprise which meant expense. If Sir John had been a man of another calibre he would have broken his bonds or attempted the operation long before. As it was, the iron of an utterly false position had entered his soul. The notion of escape did not come to him entirely without suggestion. The half mocking rumour which had suggested the barter of the overflowing wealth of the Hobbses for the unsullied blue blood of at least one of the Beauchamps, with the title to boot, had reached the ears of the person principally* con cerned. An unscrupulous old gentleman, who remembered Sir John's father and grandfather, took it upon him to administer to Sir John a very plain piece of advice. \"John Beauchamp, why don't you make up to the grown-up daughter of that plate-layer or tin-tack manu facturer \u2014 he is something in metals. They say she is a strapper and a stunner, and can hold her own with any young woman in the county whose escutcheon shows a score of quarterings. The brother is all right \u2014 everybody declares he is a nice young fellow, except for the stupid philanthropic fads which are the order of the day. The father himself ain't half a bad old chap. I have met him with the other justices ; something rather grand, eh ? about his plainness and unpretentiousness when one knows he could buy and sell the whole of us out-and-out every day. I tell you what, man, he might buy back Fair fields, if he took it into his head and the house were in the market, and make a marriage present of it to his daughter w*ithout feeling the purchase more than a flea-bite in comparison to his splendid fortune. There might be a Beauchamp of Fairfields again with such land as could be picked up by degrees, unencumbered as it has not been within the memory of man. Think of that ! Think of that, lad ! \" Quite another style of advisers\u2014 a fast young man or two, who stood in awe of nobody and nothing, who bore a grudge against Sir John for bis sobriety and"], [274, "262 A MORNING MIST. decency, and had probably taken a sample of their innumerable bets that one of them should tackle the stick of a baronet\u2014 whetted their wit upon him in con nection with the subject. It was but bumpkin wit, and assailed the victim with pointed and personal questions. \" I say, Beauchamp, is your price enormous? Oh ! you know what we mean. She's well enough in looks, if she were not so deuced blue \u2014 blue as the cerulean sky or a butcher's apron, and sharp as a needle. Her father don't turn out needles ; I take it that don't come into boiler-making. His trade is in iron, not steel ; I say, I think it ain't altogether on the square for a man, and a brother like you, who has seen the world and dipped deep into its attractions, no doubt \u2014 can pick and choose where you like, I don't question \u2014 to come and quarter yourself in these idyllic scenes and despoil a set of im pecunious chappies such as we are, with no resources to speak of, of our single matrimonial chance \u2014 our Brumma gem heiress.\" In neither case had Sir John listened to the voice of the charmer, but now her syren-strains not only penetrated his ears, but lingered in them and fascinated them. Was it ever allowable in a man of honour and good feeling to marry a woman for her money ? But that was an unduly strong and crude way of putting the question where Sir John's relations with Miss Hobbs were con cerned. He had admired her from the first moment he saw her. She was Constance's friend. Connie had a great regard for her. Indeed, Miss Hobbs was one of a family who had been consistently most kind and friendly to both Sir John and his sister, so that it was impossible not to feel some liking \u2014 a very consid erable liking \u2014 for the young lady of the house in re turn. The point to settle was whether the admiration, the liking which he entertained for Miss Hobbs was of the nature of love, was the kind of regard which a man would expect and desire to feel for his future wife. Sir John was a tyro in such matters. He had had no prior attachment. By stress of circumstances, his mental"], [275, "\"YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 263 constitution, and possibly the accident of never having come across a woman who enthralled his fancy, he had kept entirely free from such entanglements. Yet here instinct came to his aid. He could not mistake the calm appreciation of Miss Hobbs for a warmer senti ment. In the face of what he had seen of Joe Hobbs's passion for Constance, of what he had known of the master-influence in other men's lives, he could not pre tend that he had any ardent inclination to win and wed Mattie Hobbs, beautiful, clever, and good as he knew her to be. She was not the one woman in the world for him, so far as he could tell. He did not think her as sharp as a needle in the sense in which these fellows, who took impertinent liberties with his name and hers, used the word ; but he was not without a vague perception that she was too much of a good thing for him, that in her ceaseless activity and endless interests she marvelled at him with more or less impatience. She looked on his life as colourless and vapid. She viewed it and him when she was serious with a sort of generous compassion. But it must be a peculiar kind of compassion, largely leavened with reverence and admiration, as was the pity of Desdemona for Othello \u2014 something akin to the blind hero worship of which poor Connie was capable, that a man can tolerate, far less crave for, in the woman he seeks to make his wife. But Sir John brought himself to believe that it was not impossible a transformation might take place, both in his feelings and in those of Miss Hobbs. Surely it could not be very difficult to fall in love \u2014 not at first sight, certainly, as in the case of Joe Hobbs, but gradu ally, advisedly \u2014 with a woman, who was only too good for him. If he tried, and if she could be induced to second him, a miracle was not called for to bring about a change. It would be a hard saying if anybody accused either of them of being unlovable. They were both young, both handsome, both fairly well disposed. They had some tastes and pursuits in common. Miss Hobbs was fond of natural history, as she was fond of so many things. She had looked over his cases with pleasure, and"], [276, "264 A MORNING MIST. had asked his advice about a museum which she and her brother wished to establish in connection with a mechanics' institute at Dorrington. (Here Sir John himself smiled grimly at the idea of wooing a woman by means of collections of beetles and specimens of preserved lizards.) She had praised his painting \u2014 her own was far better, still she had eyes to see the line in which he excelled. He was not a susceptible, impul sive fellow like Hobbs, to be smitten with a violent attack of love, and to fall down prostrate at his god dess's feet in a trice. But he thought he was capable of a dawning affection, which, with suitable fostering, might end by being the mainstay and guiding-star of his life. He did not mean to take all and give nothing in return. He would be true, he would be tender. He would bestow on his wife his best, a lasting best, of which, if she took him at what he was worth, she should have no reason to complain. He had a percep tion that Miss Hobbs was a noble-minded woman, as her father and brother were public-spirited, benevolent men. She would rejoice to redeem his fortunes, though there should never be any word of buying back Fair fields \u2014 that was a piece of stage clap-trap, begging old Mr. Mainwarning's pardon. But she would be happy to endow and adorn the old name and title he would give her. She would never grudge \u2014 no, nor would young Joe, nor the genius, her father (for old Hobbs was a genius in his way), nor her homely mother, if she were once enlisted on his side \u2014 the material bounties which he should know how to prize at their proper value. After luncheon, still a melancholy and halting perform ance at Maisonette, Sir John invited Constance to take a stroll with him in the garden. \" But I have not been to church yet, John,\" said the heavy-eyed, heavy-hearted girl, wistfully. \" One ought to go to church the first thing after a death in the family.\" \" Qh, nonsense ! Don't hamper yourself with all these old-fashioned restrictions and rules, which are but forms at the best, and have little meaning in the present day,\""], [277, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 265 he said, hastily. \"Besides, y7ou have been in church the day of the funeral, dear,\" he told her, gently. \" You have been w*anting in no mark of respect and regard such as you and I were bound to pay to her\u2014 our faithful friend. But now you are really m want of fresh air, and why should you not take it with me when I ask you ? I am not proposing that you should go into any public place, of course, or even where you might meet people \u2014 just up and down the lawn and through the shrubbery.\" In truth, Constance was longing to go out with him into the open air, amidst the sights and sounds of Nature. Her numbed heart was beginning to feel the blood throb bing and circulating in it once more. Her engrossment with her grief, and with the one thought of her dear Miss West, which had thrust out the image of her brother, was yielding to the recollection of what he had been to her since he came home. She was awaking to the half-frightened thought, what a mercy it was that she still had him, to the passionate sense that he wras all that was left to her on earth now. She was not without a plaintive, pathetic little pang of repentance for having forgotten him for awhile, and in the compelling strength of another's merits and claims undervalued his, on which she had, till within the last week, set such store. She put on her hat, with its black riband, and, looking slimmer, fairer, and younger than ever in her heavy mourning, walked out with him as he wished. The light dazzled Constance, after her late mrwonted experience of darkened rooms. There had been a spell of rainy weather, which, towards the end of a long summer, works speedy havoc among the ripe lingering treasures of field and garden, and brings the season to an untimely close, substituting, on a day's notice, as it seems, late autumn and coming winter for the pro tracted time of roses and gillyflowers, and a hundred luxuriant and hardy annuals. \" What a change ! \" said Constance, with a little shiver, and a kind of sorrowful wonder, looking at the soaked and beaten down beds \u2014 the broken, scattered blossoms, the draggled, trampled-down leaves. Thomas"], [278, "266 A MORNING MIST. had been too much occupied lately to sweep and snip and trim the place into its usual perfect order. It looked as if it missed and bewailed the mistress who had taken such care of it. \"Yes,\" said Sir John, quickly, with an alarmed side-glance out of his long, drooping eyes at Con stance's expression. He had still a horror of her breaking down, and falling ill on his hands. \"It is always so, in a little hole, however nice, like this,\" he went on, bent on diverting her attention, and paving the way for what he had to tell her. \" It is so easily upset,\" looking round him, with a slightly disparaging air, which she had not seen in him before. \" The alterations of the seasons cannot be bridged over and smoothed down. There is neither room nor material to work upon, in fact. Now, at Kingsmeadows, where I was this morning, everything is as bright and glowing as ever. Autumn flowers have already replaced the late summer flowers. The changing foliage, and the berries, barberry, pyricanthis, and so on, which form a good feature in modern landscape gardening, are in full force. Kingsmeadows is a fine place, and the Hobbs keep it up splendidly. They are able to do it every justice. You admire Kingsmeadows very much, don't you, Connie?\" \" Yes,\" Constance assented in her turn, listlessly, and with a little hesitation. \" But we used to think Maison nette charming, all the year round,\" and the ready tears started unbidden to her eyes. She was very loyal \u2014 more so now than ever. She did not like the comparison he instituted to the disparagement of Maisonette. \" Of course,\" he said, hastily, \" it is a very pretty place of its kind. I was delighted with it w*hen I came \u2014 I thought I had never seen anything so fresh and sweet. But unfortunately it is not ours. Constance, I wish to speak to you of that and of other matters. I am sorry \u2014 exceedingly so \u2014 to intrude business and other questions on you so soon, but unhappily I cannot very well help myself. I am forced to come to a decision, and to apply to you for your opinion on a point which must be considered at once.\""], [279, "\"YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.' 267 \" Oh, John, I don't mind,\" said Constance, earnestly. \" I shall be only too glad, if you find anything I can say worth listening to. Miss West used to tell me what she proposed to do when there were repairs or improvements to be undertaken, though she could hardly be said to consult me, for she knew ever so much better than I, aud I was still very much of a child to her. I am afraid I was very childish and thoughtless, and full of myself. I was very little assistance to her,\" she ended, in a quivering voice. This would not do at all. These reminiscences must be stopped. He must plunge into what he had to say without further preamble. \" You were everything she could wish, rest assured of that, my dear. She said as much as that to me, both in writing and speaking, several times,\" he declared, quickly, as if he were dismissing the subject gently, but in a man's masterful way. \" Now I wish you to give me your undivided attention. I wish you to listen to some thing very different which I heard to-day, and that was a considerable surprise to me. It may not be so much so to you, of course, because it concerns you very nearly, and people \u2014 girls, I believe \u2014 have generally a premonition of such events when they have to do with themselves.\" Constance gave no sign beyond that of startled bewilderment. \" Connie, young Hobbs asked me this morning for my consent to his making you an offer of marriage,\" said Sir John, in desperation. \" To his making me an offer of marriage ! \" repeated Constance, bluntly, without a blush, while she opened her blue eyes wide and stood stock still in the gravel path, not many yards from the antediluvian target. \" What could make him think of such au idiotic thing ? What could have put it into his head ? \" It was not a very promising beginning, even such a novice as Sir John could see that ; but, at least, she would grow familiar with the idea \u2014 it would no longer take her by surprise."], [280, "268 A MORNING MIST. \"Come along out of sight of the windows, and out of earshot of the maidservants. This would be a fine piece of gossip for them,\" he told her, tucking her hand under his arm, and proceeding to walk her away to the furthest limits of the Maisonnette grounds. \" I cannot tell what put it into his head, you should know that better than I. I suppose it was a case at first sight.\" \" But you can see I don't know,\" cried Coustance, rosy red at last with indignation, which acted as a stimulant on her sickness of heart. \"How could you think such a thing of me, John ? It never crossed my mind that any man was so absurd as to propose that I should marry him. Young Mr. Hobbs would have been the last man in the world whom I should have sus pected of such a ridiculous, such an impertinent sug gestion. I fancy,\" with a little hysterical laugh w*hich sounded, oh ! so oddly and jarringly in her own ears, \" he meant to finish my education in trades-unions and workmen's strikes. No, John,\" with sudden solem nity, \" I never could have believed that he would be so foolish, so presumptuous. You may be quite sure that I had not the slightest notion, or else I should have put an end to the thing at once.\" \" I am not blaming you,\" her brother interrupted her. He smiled his usual slow smile, but he spoke almost faintly, and she did not listen to him. \" I never gave him the very least encouragement in such preposterous behaviour. This comes of his mother's having stayed here,\" she was saying in an excited key. \" But she will be very angry, I know that. To talk such stupid nonsense at a time like this, to affront and mortify me, when he must know that I am so grieved. I could not have imagined that anybody could be so rude and unkind. I could not have thought he would have had such horribly bad taste, for his sister is my friend ; he has been brought up like a gentleman, and I never doubted that he was one, though he had the misfortune to be in trade, was low-born, and the son of that woman \u25a0 \u2014 that mother of his.\" \" Coustance, Constance, what are you thinking of \u2014"], [281, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 269 what are you saying?\" remonstrated Sir John, quite sternly, drawing her hand more tightly through his arm. \" You are speaking very wildly, almost wickedly. It is you who are silly, arrogant, insolent. There, I did not mean to hurt you, Connie, but you must not talk in that manner \u2014 never again, if you prize my good opinion. Mrs. Hobbs was most kind to you and tome. I do not know what we should have done without her \u2014 I shall never forget her kindness, and shall count her one of the best and truest of friends whatever happens. I thought also that Miss Hobbs had loaded you with kindness.\" \" I don't deny that they have intended to be kind,\" said Constance, a little abashed, and speaking brokenly. \" I don't deny that I have liked Mattie Hobbs very much \u2014 everybody likes her and thinks much of her. I am sorry if I am ungrateful. But that is something very different from her brother's insulting me \u2014 just now, too. Of course, we shall never be friends again ; but I will say this for Miss Hobbs, I am convinced that she knew nothing of this, she would have done her best to prevent it \u2014 she could never have had the heart.\" \" Connie, be reasonable,\" said Sir John, firmly. \" In the first place, you are grossly insulting Hobbs by saying he has insulted you. In the second, his proposal \u2014 the inopportuneness of which seems to strike you as much as anything \u2014 was wrung from him by my casual mention of the strait I am in. Do you know what is the state of my affairs and y7ours? \" Constance's scared eyes and trembling lips formed themselves into \" No\" without her uttering any sound. \" Very well, then, here is the position we are in. Poor Miss West's annuity, which my father managed to settle on her, dies with her, and it turns out it was all w7hich she and you had. She thought fit to take no notice of the fact, from the best of motives. No doubt,\" he took care to add, as he had an intuition that his sister would gather together her failing forces to repudiate any reflec tion on her late guardian's tactics, \" she could not tell exactly what I knew, and she was certainly not acquainted with the slenderness of my means. I regret to tell you,"], [282, "270 A MORNING MIST. Connie, they are about as slender as a gentleman's means can well be. I am taking you into my confidence, you understand,\" he explained, elaborately, \" and asking you to think over the subject with me and say what you would wish and advise. My mother's fortune, such as she had, independent of others, was muddled away, partly by her husband, when he had some control over it, in the earlier days of their married life, partly by her own mismanage ment at a later period. The topic is not a particularly pleasant one for me to discuss,\" he added, with increased constraint in his tones, \"nor is it one that you would care much to hear about, I daresay. I inherited very little money from my mother's father, and one of the in vestments in which it was laid out failed. I have my pay, of course, which was wont to suffice for an officer ; but an expensive style of living has crept into all regi ments, more or less.\" Sir John breathed more freely. He was dealing with generalities, he might even, quiet as he was, be mounting the hobby-horse of a grievance. \" The purchase system is done away with, competitive examinations are the order of the day, we are informed on every hand that the service is open to all, and merit is what tells ; but I can assure you, Constance, the pro fession of a soldier is practically only fit for men of inde pendent means. Those unhappy fellows who are w-ithout private resources are hard put to it, and must either run into debt, and go to the devil by the shortest, if it is also the merriest, road, or lead the life of anchorites in a society of Sybarites, especially if the regiment is a crack one.\" \" I did not understand, I have been very stupid,\" said Constance, nervously; \"but it is right that I should know. Thank you for telling me, John. I am very sorry. I wish I could help you \u2014 at least, I must not be a burden on y7ou. I will do something, anything, for my living. Surely there is something that I can do.\" \" You are talking nonsense,\" said Sir John, almost angrily. \" Of course, you are my charge. You are my sister, and it is my duty to take care of you till I can give you into safer keeping, when, believe me, Constance,\""], [283, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 271 he declared in grave sincerity, \" I shall be sorry for my own sake to give you up. I would take you to India to-morrow, or when my leave is out, but it is not a place for people in our circumstances. I could not make a home for you there such as you ought to have. I could only take y7ou with one purpose. You know what women used to be sent out to India for. No ? \" He looked into hor innocent, unsuspicious eyes, and had to force himself to finish what he desired to put before her. \" Then I must enlighten you, but don't blame me for referring to an odious practice. Girls were sent to India to get husbands of some sort at the shortest notice. Bad, wasn't it ? But perhaps it was not so much worse than what one hears of \u2014 worldly-minded mothers and rich relations bringing up poor girls for a season in town, and letting them know that they must make the best of it \u2014 they must marry, somehow, on its termination. I should detest such a prospect for you,\" said Sir John, getting very red. \" I should feel myself degraded by having anything to do with it.\" Constance hung her head. There was a pause. He began again more calmly : \" There is only one other way. I could sell out of the army, and we two might just manage to live cheaply on the interest of the money got by the sale of my commission. I do not pretend that it would be giving up much on my own account. Neither my present experience nor my future look-out are very brilliant. It would only be the relinquishing of the little hope that is left in a career which is still in force, the sense that all is ended, and that what has gone before of effort and endurance in acquiring certain attain ments is throwm away. And it is my duty to warn you, Constance, for your own sake, that our life at some unfrequented watering-place in England, or in some obscure little Continental town, would be the merest vegetating, only a step above grinding poverty.\" Still she said nothing, she did not even look at him, as they walked side by side. She clutched the folds of her dress, which she had gathered to raise it from the ground, and swung them mechanically to and fro."], [284, "272 A MORNING MIST. Was she making up her mind to condemn herself and him to the dismal fate he had foreshadowed ? She was so young and ignorant that he felt himself called upon to remonstrate with her yet more strongly. ' ' Constance, I don't wish to take advantage of you, or to influence you unduly ; you believe that, don't you? \" he began by inquiring with something like severity. She bent her head, and then looked up at him for a moment with an appealing, frightened look which did not please him. He thought her very unreasonable, very unmanageable \u2014 unlike what he had known her. She was not taking into account that it cost him a good deal to speak to her in this manner \u2014 he was having a pretty hard quarter of an hour, and it was all for her good. \" I am bound to beg you to think seriously before you commission me to reject young Hobbs' suit, to which I believe his father and mother will make no objection.\" She raised her head once more at this, but dropped it again the next moment. \" He is an excellent fellow, unexceptionable in himself, as you say of his sister. Everybody whose opinion is worth minding has a good word to say of him. Remem ber it is him you are asked to marry \u2014 not his mother, or anybody else connected with him. He is evidently much attached to you, though the attachment may have been more rapid than you can well imagine, but it is not likely for that reason to die a sudden death, in a man like him. It is safe to be trusted, as he is trust worthy. In addition, he has all that we want. To be one day mistress of Kingsmeadows would be no mean fate, it w7ould be a position any woman might enjoy and be proud of. My dear Connie, don't you think to put that and the life-long regard of a thoroughly nice fellow lightly from you would be a rash act, which you might bitterly regret all the days of your life? \" Still, she said not a word, the whole discussion had come upon her hke a thunder-clap. The stroll with her brother in the rain-beaten, Autumn garden had been, as it turned out, terrible to her. But as he had spoken to her of the honour and happiness of being the future"], [285, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 273 mistress of Kingsmeadows, a vision darted into her mind of its present mistress, with her sharp, dark eyes, her hard colour, her slightly- projecting, pursed up mouth, her \" ain'ts \" and her \" dos,\" in her scrimp, rich gowns, practising one of her favourite attitudes of sitting with her bony hands closed, and the prominent knuckles resting either on her lap or on the table before her. \" There is not the slightest fault to be found with his family,\" Sir John was in the act of saying, while he began to show an inclination to irascibility, which was naturally foreign to \" the long lad,\" whose distinguishing attributes had been patience and long-suffering \u2014 \" not a fault, unless that they have raised themselves to the honour able position which they now fill so worthily, and that, in the judgment of every right-thinking person, should only redound to their credit. Good heavens ! everybody must have risen at some time, the Beauchamps among the rest.\" \"It must have been a long time ago, and after a different fashion,' said Constance, at last, with that quaver of hysterical laughter again, as she recalled the knight y old Beauchamps riding cap-a-pie, taking captive their enemies in fair fight, and naturally falling heirs to their lands. \" I wish to goodness the fashion had been as credit able,'' replied Sir John, still fuming under the exigencies of the situation and of his inability to deal with them. \" Robbery and murder, I take it, were the old-established rules ; whereas Hobbs of Kingsmeadows has been a public benefactor and a blessing to his kind. He has extended the borders of civilisation,\" he added, a little grandiloquently, probably referring to locomotives in con nection with railways, and to their introduction into the prairies of America, the steppes of Russia, the jungles of India, and at no distant date, doubtless, into the awful deserts, and still more awful forest swamps, of Africa. Sir John did not condescend to details, which would have sounded prosaic after such a peroration. \" I have been told on creditable authority,\" he went on, and even 1H"], [286, "274 A MORNING MIST. this sounded like an anti-climax, \" he has refused a baronetcy from the present Government, which may very well be, since I don't question that he has a barony within his option, if he care to take it,\" he ended, defiantly. \" I am sure he is welcome to it for me,\" said Constance, in low tones of rising sullenness. '' Constance, you are not behaving at all well about the Hobbses.\" Her brother went at her again, like a man who did not know when to stop. \" You are preparing to make Mrs. Hobbs a very poor return for her good deeds. You have received nothing save kindness and respect from them, and this proposal of Joe Hobbs's is the crowning proof of esteem. It is the highest com pliment he or any man could pay you, and you are showing no consideration either for him or for any one else. You are acting like a very young and silly girl. I confess I expected more sense and good-feeling from you. I do not know what you would have, I do not know what you think yourself. Of course, you have never seen him in the light of a lover \u2014 a young girl like you cannot have thought much of love ; but if you practised a little unselfishness and did your duty, the love would come in proper time.\" Sir John gave the vague assu rance usual on such occasions. \" For myself, I cannot see what you are fighting against. This opening appears to me positively providential. It seems to me that you could not do better.\" She gave a kind of gasp of utter distress and dismay. She looked him full in the face, at length, with a glance of keen reproach and sore despair. \" Come in, John,\" she said, plucking at his sleeve, \" I cannot bear any more ; I will- do what you wish.\" \" That is right, Connie; and you will never repent it. You will do your best, like a reasonable, unselfish, little girl, and you may depend upon it you will have your reward.\" He tried to encourage her, but even while he was speaking he was telling himself, savagely for so self-controlled a man, that he had been behaving like a bear and brute to his young sister."], [287, "\" YOU COULD NOT DO BETTER.\" 275 Yet all the time he had been seeking to withhold from her any know-ledge that would hurt and humiliate her. He had been refraining from enlightening her on the blot on her descent, which rendered Joe Hobbs' suit all the more generous in him, and doubly desirable so her."], [288, "CHAPTER XXII. BEATEN. Constance might have made a better fight had the battle been waged at another time, and with different weapons. But she was already crushed by Miss West's death, the first great sorrow since her childhood. She was dis mayed by her unprotected, unprovided-for state, the knowledge of which had been suffered to burst upon her without preparation. She was bewildered by the prac tical, business side of life, with which she had nothing to do previously, thus made to stare her, all at once, in the face. She was stricken by the anguish of the convic tion that, without any blame on her side or his, she was likely to be an intolerable burden to Sir John. She must either force him to do that from which his pride and delicacy shrank quite as much as hers shrank, carry her out to India, with the plain intention of, so far as it lay in his power, disposing of her in marriage without delay, or she must consent to his relinquishing his profession, and practically ruining him self, as he had let her see, for her sake. What ! con demn him in the prime of his youth to wear away his life with her, as he had described the process, without any chance of recovering w7hat he had forfeited, to let all his faculties rust till his heart broke, or his reason gave way ? Her brother, of whom she had been so proud and so fond \u2014 Sir Johu Beauchamp \u2014 who ought to have been of Fairfields, her father's representative, the head of the house ! How could she accept the sacrifice either way, and answer to herself and others? Her happiness did not matter much now to anybody."], [289, "BE A TEN. 277 But though Constance made this sombre reflection, she contrived to exonerate her brother from the offence of having driven her to the conclusion at which she had arrived. She forgave him for being worse than un heroically helpless in the circumstances. With the perverse ingenuity and outrageous injustice of youth and inexperience, she reserved her grudge for young Joe. He had been supremely absurd and quite unwarranted in thinking of her in the light in which he had thought of her \u2014 a proceeding which had led to his impulsive interference in the Beauchamps' affairs. And that, again, while it had afforded a loophole of escape to Sir John from his difficulties, had horribly complicated matters where Constance herself w7as concerned. Poor Joe ! In those days he could almost afford to be slighted and misjudged. He was in the seventh heaven of unquestioning rapture, incidental to his excitable, confiding nature, on receiving the reluctant promise of an utterly passive bride. Her extreme shyness and deep de pression might, however, have been largely attributed, even by a less-exigent man, to her season of mourning, to her first conscious acquaintance with bereavement, to the pam she must feel on the breaking up of the establish ment at Maisonette, and the removal of old familiar landmarks \u2014 the whole of the influences operating on a young and simple girl. Joe had been right as to his own family. He had no opposition, hardly a remonstrance to fear from them. They respected his freedom of choice, his man's rights, too profoundly. It did not signify in the least that his kindred had their own thougnts and their own speech among themselves on the event. \" We must stand by young Joe's choice, and make the best of her,\" said old Joe, as if he were stating an in contestable truth. \" She is a modest young woman, as far as I can see, and that is the main thing. He has got his mind, it remains to be seen whether he will find it quite satisfactory even to himself \u2014 whether to have been foiled in his calf love, and to have waited a little, and thought twice in his choice of a wife, would not have"], [290, "278 A MORNING MIST. been a more promising look-out. But there,\" giving his strong arms a stretch, as if he were calling himself to account, \" that is what we all say when we're getting up in years, and have put a few of our fancies to the test. We think differently at Joe's age, and it is ordained that we should buy, not borrow, experience.\" It was supposed by some of those who listened to the mild yet inflexible boilermaker that he might be thinking of his own first love, \" Joe's girl's \" mother, and reflect ing what a handful she would have been to him, as she had been to the aristocratic vagrant, Sir Randal. She had been a woman of weak will, and no strength of character or principle, unable to bear her own burden, incapable of learning a new lesson, or rising to a wider prospect than the narrow one with which she had started; a creature broken down by her sin and shame, unfit to face them, and live them down, to turn over the fresh leaf of a wiser, truer, less selfish life. Nobody was more fully alive than old Joe Hobbs was to what he had escaped in losing his first love, and to how much better off he was with his Hannah, whom no circumstances could daunt and master, who was ready to keep him and everybody else in order. Still, he could never quite forget poor Bessie, or what she had been to him. The pretty blue-eyed lass, with whom her daughter, in her delicate beauty and refinement, her aristocratic air, which she had got from Sir Randal and the Beauchamps, would never compare. His Bessie had been full of flights and flouts, and pretty, merry tricks, in spite of her hard rearing. Joe's Constance, or whatever she was called, who had been brought up by a woman like Miss West, and had enjoyed every advantage, yet sat tongue-tied, with her hands crossed in her lap, a lifeless piece of goods, for all young Joe's frenzy about her. But just as he had once cared for Bessie Lane more than for auy other mortal being, so here was his boy Joe, for whom he had with reason entertained the highest hopes, only too happy to fling himself away on Bessie's daughter who could not have held the candle to her mother. And Joe was not fit to accept a warning or listen to common-sense on"], [291, "BE A TEN. 279 the subject, even if anybody had been at liberty to speak it to him. Yes ; Joe must take his chance, and shape his fate for himself, like a man. After all, it was not fair to prejudge the girl, who had a look both of her father and mother, for if Bessie's hair had been the pale gold of the morning sun, Sir Randal's had been the red gold of the same sun when he sinks to rest behind a bank of stormy clouds, If Bessie's eyes had been blue as dewy violets, Sir Randal's had been blue as flashing steel. Bessie's old lover had felt inclined to call her daughter, young Joe's flame, \" an inanimate, stuck-up thing,\" but in her greater stillness and reserve might lie the redemption to be wrought by a deeper, finer nature. Her brother, Sir John, was not a bad sort \u2014 a fellow who had done his best, though he might not set the Thames on fire. He was a mighty improvement on his father, though well nigh destitute of the elder man's facile charm, while the graceless fine gentleman had not been without counter balancing virtues either. He had sought to make up to Bessie for the cruel wrong he had done her. Instead of pensioning her off in cold blood, or flinging her to the dogs in his madness, he had married her, and when he was forced to see that he could not make a lady of her by giving her the title of Lady Beauchamp, or endow her with mother wit in the room of culture, or teach her to forget and grow happy in the few years she had lived as his wife \u2014 a nervous, jealous invalid, dying on her feet \u2014 he had borne with her tenderly. If everybody had been reared as Sir Randal had been bred, or had sprung from the same stock \u2014 for the Beauchamps had been a wild lot for generations, and there had been little peace and harmony to spare between his father and mother, or between his grandfather and grandmother, for that matter \u2014then few people might have done much better, or half so well, as the man who had completed the worldly ruin of his family. Therefore, in place of cursing the dead, or proposing to disinherit the living for \"drawing up\" with Sir Randal and Bessie Lane's daughter, old Joe, in his Christian sagacity and forbearance, judged righteous"], [292, "280 A MORNING MIST. judgment, and had even a good word to say for his former rival. Mrs. Hobbs quoted, gloomily, the well-known axiom that there was such a thing as pleasing your eye to plague your heart. In order to become more personal, she declared obstinately that she was morally certain her lad would be hers no longer, and she had kept a soft heart for her first-born, but she was going to be properly punished like many another mother. \" When it comes to that, Mattie,\" she said, suddenly turning upon her daughter, \" I had a deal rather it had been you and Miss's brother.\" \"Upon my word, mother, this is too bad of you!\" cried Mattie, half laughing, half indignant; \"I admit that poor Constance's mental and moral stature is far beneath our Joe's, aud that she has been kept back and dwarfed with the best intentions, so that I have a fear she may never grow up to his level. If I had not the greatest faith in my dear old Joe, I should dread rather his being dragged down to her standard. But to say you w7ould have preferred that I had been about to marry a handsome automaton, a dull, drowsy slave of conven tionalities and circumstances !

Soldiering, when there is blows to be struck, may fit in with an emp'y purse, but in them times of peace \u2014 as let us be thankful are the ordinary times \u2014 it do be fair mockery and cruelty to think on it, like rearing an unhappy lad for the Church as has not the root of the matter in him, as has no call from God, no gift for man, no nothing.\""], [293, "BE A TEN. 281 \"That may be all very true,\" argued Mattie; \"but though Sir John is to be pitied, what have I done that you should condemn me to share the pity he excites? \" \" It were only by way of comparison, Mattie,\" her mother was brought to own; \"at the same time, you have enough goodish stuff in you to stir my gentleman up and enliven him.

He ain't airified, like that dandilly minx as has taken hold of poor Joe, and caught his simple fancy \u2014 men is that simple where women is concerned, send men to college, or to furrin' parts as you will.

For Joe's sake, try to judge her more gently.\" \" It's come to a pretty pass when I have to go to school to my own girl,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, in a pungent aside. \" Her may be as wise and as far travelled as the Queen of Sheba, but that don't give her a warrant to instruct the mother as bore her.\" \" Forgive me, mother,\" said Mattie, penitently. \" I did not mean to presume on your goodness, to tell you what you should do or say \u2014 you w*ho are so much older, and have seen so much more of life than I ; you, who are so self-forgetful, and have been such a friend in need to Constance Beauchamp herself.\" \" Nay, do you forgive me, for a hot-tempered, hot headed old woman,\" said the mollified tyrant. \"But I were kind to the girl, I ain't going to smother my honour and deny it ; and how did she pay me back ?

She has not courted that fool Joe through his mother, though she has jumped at him, fast enough, for all her hold-offishness, when he was in such a red-hot hurry to come forward, the simpleton ! Sir John, poor chap, was of another mind. He were that thankful and obligated he could not make enough of me, little as I did for him, or anybody.\" Mrs. Hobbs sud denly descended into the depths of modesty, but she was not long of coming up again, and rising to fresh heights of self-assertion and self-reliance. \" But you need be in no frights for me, Martha Hobbs. It is true I have lost my fine lad, and I ain't the woman to take that light ; but I ain't going to gratify her pride and ill-will by showing her what I feel on that score. Neither, I hope, am I the woman to forget as she is to be young Joe's wife, and that his mother should be the last woman to show her the cold shoulder, and cast scorn upon her. I ain't such a ninny as that comes to.\" So old Joe, in going about his colossal business trans actions, kept turning over in his mind at intervals, with great naivete for such a man, what acceptable fatherly present he could make to Joe's \"intended\" \u2014 whether she would care for a pretty thing of a necklace, or the last invention in watches, or whether, among all the carriages and horses at Kingsmeadows, there might not be just a little trap, with its corresponding ponies, which would serve as a toy chariot, all her own, to offer to a bride. Whether Mrs. Joe \u2014 to be \u2014 would, or would not, prize such a fairy phaeton, and pair of diminutive milk white steeds as Lady Theresa Langton, with the support of a tiger in the background, was pleased to drive through the Oxfordshire lanes ? And Mrs Hobbs, when revelling in the contents of her linen closet, bethought her that her successor in office could not begin to lay in her store of household linen too soon, and that it was mean to confront her with the unanswerable fact that she had not brought her"], [295, "BE A TEN. 283 share of snowy, glossy, satin-smooth napery to heap up still higher the overflowing shelves of the linen presses. Thereupon Mrs. Hobbs at once sent a magnificent order to Belfast and Dunfermline on the behalf of the future mistress of Kingsmeadows. After all, it was Mrs. Hobbs who suggested that the marriage should take place immediately. She could not conceive the possibility of any change in Joe's intentions. He had, in his mother's phrase, \" promised the girl marriage,\" and what was to be, had better be done out of hand, iu Mrs. Hobbs's brisk, unfaltering estimate. The circumstances were so far peculiar as to justify haste. The Maibonnette establishment had to be broken up at once, and what was to become of Miss Beauchamp in the meantime ? It would be sheer idle waste and folly for Sir John to take other quarters, or to go gadding about with his sister till she was out of mourning, if he was not back to liis work of soldiering in India before then. She might, of course, come to them for a long visit at Kingsmeadows. Mrs. Hobbs would disdain to object to receive the young lady as a guest, where she might so soon have a right to present herself as a member of the family ; but that arrangement would be, on the whole, more trying and awkward for all parties than it would be for Constance Beauchamp to become Constance Hobbs as soon as possible, and arrive at Kingsmeadows iu her new character. Mr. Hobbs saw no obstacle to the last plan. He was somewdiat of his wife's opinion that when a man or a woman had made up his or her mind to an important step, the more speedily it was taken the greater its chance of success, and the better for all who had to do with it. One of the maxims of his busy and prosperous life had been not to let the grass grow beneath his horses' feet. Young Joe, it was hardly necessary to say, was eager with more than a bridegroom's eagerness for the fulfil ment of the pledge which Sir John had given in his sister's name, and the securing, not of his felicity alone, but of hers also \u2014 hers first and foremost. For who"], [296, "284 A MORNING MIST. would cherish and comfort her, and inform her young ideas as he would ? He was sensible that his family were doing well by him, as he had expected them to do, and he knew also that they did not think Constance Beauchamp a suitable wife for him. He did not blame them, passionately as he was in love with Constance ; he was only too well aware that they had little in common\u2014 that she did not sym pathise with him, or even understand him, in his aims and aspirations. He knew in the innermost depths of his nature that all her intercourse with him, from the moment she had enchanted him -with her consent to his hasty wooing, was shy, distant, and cold. She w*as over come, indeed, and he could guess the truth, by an agony of shame, mortification, and sorrowful longing for Miss West, who had been her refuge and stay in all the small troubles of her earlier life. He was as honestly, genuinely modest as his father was, while he had inherited from both father and mother a dogged determination and persistency in the pursuit of any object on which he had set his heart. She was so young and unformed, he told himself, whenever a cloud of doubt came between him and the sun of his bliss, and chilled him like a dank mist. She was in such grief \u2014 the unreasoning grief of an innocent, ingenuous, loving, and faithful disposition \u2014 for the less of almost the only friend she had known till her brother came home. He told his friends the same tale, saying frankly, \" I can guess that you thick I am not choosing quite wisely. You do not know her, and allow me to say you do not make sufficient allow7ance for her, poor darling. She is so young and sad on account of what has happened. I had to put force upon myself and her to plead my cause at such a time, and how could you suppose that she would not feel it ? That is the only thing I regret, or that you have any reason to demur at. You may trust me for the rest \u2014 I know best what is for my happiness. She is young, as I said, and still younger in mmd than in years. She has been brought up in an old-fashioned, childish way. All will come right, you will see. As it"], [297, "BE A TEN. 285 is, I have to thank my people for not making much ado at this sudden move of mine, for being as kind and just as I thought and said they would be.\" Joe disarmed his family by his heartfelt thanks, while he ruffled up his hair, short as it was, into an eccentric crest, and those clear grey eyes of his showed that light as well as dark eyes are capable of burning and glowing, and of display ing, at the same time, a crystal translucency and a capacity for the expression of trustfulness peculiar to themselves. Sir John was ready to accept a speedy marriage for his sister. He had little enough means to spare for carrying her away and procuring change of scene for her ; it would be better bestowed in supplementing her trousseau. With regard to that item, he fancied, in his simplicity, that it would be conveniently modified if Constance married in the depth of 'the mourning which she had instituted for herself, as if poor Miss West had been the girl's mother. When it came to that, the spinster governess and chaperon had been much more to her pupil than her own mother could have been. But what was the value of even the most splendid trousseau to the Hobbs ? A drop in the bucket to young Joe, who was, without question, pining to furnish his wife with a matron's outfit, worthy of the bride of a future million aire. There was another influence at work. Though Con stance had never reproached her brother with his willing ness to transfer her to another person's keeping, Sir John was not without the consciousness that his conduct in the matter had not been entirely disinterested. This rendered him uncomfortable, for he was what might be classed as morally finical. He was capable of torment ing himself over the bare idea that he had been guilty of any wrord or deed derogatory to his cut and dry code as a man of unblemished truth and honour. There had been a considerable amount of constraint in his relations with Constance since their conclusive saunter in the garden, and that, too, worried him. When it came to Constance's feelings on what was so"], [298, "286 A MORNING MIST. serious a question to her, she had all the rashness and desperation of youth. She was a burden to herself and everybody. She could not work \u2014 even if she had known how, John would not have suffered it \u2014 and to beg she was ashamed. If she was to sacrifice herself in order to keep Sir John from sacrificing himself \u2014 since he did not see what better she could do \u2014 in that calm sum ming-up of the matter, if young Hobbs were willing to take her as she was \u2014 that is, without extorting any false professions of regard for him, or of hope for their future \u2014 and if his friends did not oppose his design, the sooner everything was over the better, even though she still blushed furiously, or grew white and cold at the bare thought. Nothing mattered now, and she was too weary and wretched to dispute anything people took the trou ble of settling for her. She had been trained to obey Miss West implicitly ; she had never dreamt of disputing her authority, so now she obeyed Sir John, who had taken Miss West's place, and was ready to walk over a precipice, three-fourths blindfold, at his bidding. Con stance's unqualified submission was partly due to a reck less impulse, partly to the pang which Sir John's advice had inflicted on her, and partly to the circumstance that she had been brought up under an absolute monarchy of the private and domestic kind. Only Mattie held aloof from all the others in her con viction. She cried that such haste was madness. It was not fair either to Constance Beauchamp or to Joe, to combine in frantically expediting the marriage. She thought that everybody connected with the ill-omened affair \u2014 as she did not hesitate to call it \u2014 had lost his or her head, as poor dear Joe had lost his. But Mattie's single voice, though of such compass as rarely to fail in being heard and attended to, was borne down in the grand, general chorus to which it was opposed. There was a quickly got-up wedding, so impromptu in every respect, so shorn of its attendant preparations and immemorial rites, that though it took the Kings meadows' neighbours by storm in its accomplishment, and set them talking vigorously, the surprise and talk"], [299, "BE A TEN. 287 were after instead of before the ceremony. The recent death of Miss West, and the instant arrangements made for the Beauchamps quitting Maisonette, formed an ex cuse for the headlong haste, and for a remission of the ordinary accompaniments of a wedding. Sir John gave his sister away, of course, and Constance put off her mourning for one day, to appear early on a foggy autumn morning a3 a bride in the parish church. Mattie Hobbs was the single bridesmaid, and the best man was one of her young brothers. The bride stood like a statue, and was as tearless. Sir John himself was not stonier. The bridegroom was the most nervous and distrait of bridegrooms, gave the responses with feverish fervour in the wrong places, and very nearly dropped the ring. Mattie, who was everybody 'sprompter and supporter on ordinary occasions, was nearly as much put out as her brother was, and had the greatest difficulty in keeping from crying on her own account, w7hile she had a vivid comprehension that tears are in admissable in a bridesmaid. Old Joe Hobbs behaved as w*ell as he always did, and Mrs. Hobbs, unusually sub dued, kept him in countenance. But what guest or spectator at a wedding has attention to spare to the father and mother of the bridegroom, even though one of the pair should be a boiler-maker on a gigantic scale, and the other the partner of his bosom ? It w*as a mercy that the ceremony was strictly private, attended only by the members of the respective families \u2014 the Beauchamp family being as scantily represented as it could well be. There was no wedding-breakfast, and, of course, no proposing of toasts or drinking of healths, though there was, somewhere in the background, a bride's-cake, which Mrs. Hobbs found spirit to cut, and to which the young Hobbs and Parrys did ample justice. The very bell-ringers were not at their post. They had so lately rung a knell for poor Miss West that it struck those who had the ordering of the day's proceedings it would be incongruous and unbecoming to strike up a joy-peal for the young pair who departed through the scanty sprinkling of gaping Oxfordshire villagers, who"], [300, "288 A MORNING MIST. had got wind of the event \u2014 unrung, untoasted, unpur sued with largesses of rice and old slippers. It was a poor marriage-day for the son and heir of the Squire of Kingsmeadows, many a homely critic remarked. And though nobody was guilty of the observation, more than one person thought that the melancholy marriage of Constance Beauchamp's mother could not have been a more perfunctory, huddled-over affair. Yet no slight was intended to be dealt to anybody ; it was all the fault of that unlucky, over-eager Joe, and of Sir John Beauchamp w7ith the rest of the friends of the principals for aiding and abetting them. The couple went away for their honeymoon. How long it was to last, and where it was to be spent, the ill used public could not tell, but it was understood that Mr. and Mrs. Joe Hobbs, junior, were to return presently to Kingsmeadows, and remain there till they could fix on a house of their own, and achieve its furnishing. Lady Theresa Langton, who liked to have her finger in everybody's pie, when she was in the mood, was vexed, in proportion to the slight, that she had not been taken into the Hobbses' and Beauchamps' confidence, and enabled to grace the very quiet wedding by her aristo cratic presence. She alleged it was positively indecent to be married in such a rude, unceremonious style. It was safe to predict that the corresponding proverb would not fail \u2014 there would be repentance at leisure to match this indecorous hurry. She was sorry, for she rather liked young Hobbs and his frown. Ye gods ! How he must have frowned when he delivered his \"I will.\" She had actually enter tained the thought of electing him one of her tame cats, and she had half meant to patronise Miss Beauchamp, because she was ravishingly pretty and had really an air with her, though she had seen nothing of the world, and received no guidance save from that poor old starched thing of a former governess. She would not have liked this setting aside of all becoming forms. Lady Theresa wondered how Sir John Beauchamp could have con sented to the compromise for his sister, unless the long,"], [301, "BE A TEN. 289 lazy, penniless fellow was bribed with his own particular biibe awaiting him in the near distance. Such a double alliance might on the whole improve Miss Hobbs, though she needed very little improvement. She was a delight ful girl, and she aud her fortune would be the next thing to be thrown away on the pauper-baronet. But she was just a little too strong-minded, clever, busy, and careless about what she called trifles. Trifles ! They were the very pillars of society, the essentials of civilisation. To make light of them was conduct calculated to stamp the offspring of even the wealthiest and most remarkable of boiler-makers with traces of the pit whence they had been dug. No doubt when they were in their primitive condition they reckoned their Sunday suits and a day's outing enough of a demonstration when the men and women among them took working partners. Mrs. Hobbs would tell you all about it any day you liked. But such theories ought not to recommend themselves to Sir John Beauchamp. Lady Theresa was not unsupported in her verdict. Various young ladies of the county, who would not have objected to young Joe Hobbs as a suitor in the abstract, declared loudly that it was a very fortunate thing he had met with a girl who could put up with his extra ordinary notions. As for them, they would not have regarded themselves as lawfully married if the marriage Lad been so slurred over and done in the dark. 19"], [302, "CHAPTER XXIII. IN exile. It was all over, as Constance had prefigured it. Her life was at an end. Constance Beauchamp was no more. She was merged into a member of the Hobbs family. She had carried her ineffaceable air of distinc tion \u2014 however obtained \u2014 into alien surroundings. She had lost her individuality, her independence. Her pros pect and horizon were gone. Maisonette had become a terra incognita. She was transplanted to Kingsmeadows among entirely new ways and doings, for which she had neither heart nor taste. Even Sir John had passed for the present out of the strange circle which had swallowed up Constance. He had felt that after having disposed of poor, dear Conny so unexceptionably by establishing her as the younger Mrs. Hobbs at Kingsmeadows it would be too barefaced in him to quarter himself also there, in spite of the elder and younger Joe's cordial invitation for him to remain, and Mrs. Hobbs' brusquer, but trustworthy assurance that there was room and to spare for them all \u2014 Beauchamps as well as Hobbs. Conscience makes cowards of us all. Sir John might have been less scru pulous had it not been for his sense of his half-formed design that the Beauchamps should form another highly advantageous alliance with the results of the great boiler-maker's enterprise and industry. He excused himself to himself by the argument, not only that he really admired and liked Miss Hobbs, and held the whole family in high esteem, as he well might ; he could offer her an historical name and a title which was not a"], [303, "IN EXILE. 291 creation of yesterday in exchange for her portion of her father's wealth. Yet he had a suspicion all the time that the Hobbs were somehow different from other master-tradesmen, at least from the traditions which were current of the class. They might be parvenus \u2014 they could not help that \u2014 everybody, as he had proved to Conny, must have a beginning. But they had not au atom of adventurers in them. He was forced to doubt whether they cared half as much as he did for an old name and title. He was driven to suspect that was an amiable out-of-date weakness chiefly indulged in by the owners of these useless appendages. There might be another reason, which sent Sir John wandering away from what he was secretly persuaded was his fate, in search of bracing air, picturesque scenery, odds and ends of sport, all to be combined with cheap lodgings iu the by-ways, rather than the highways of the kingdom. He shrank a little from the sight of his sister's white face and drooping figure, so unlike those of a bride. He began to dread lest a strain of reproach should steal into young Hobbs' eager, wistful eyes. Constance was eminently conservative. She had been brought up, as her lover had said, in an old-fashioned school, in a half childish way, with only the vaguest comprehension of her relations and responsibilities to her fellow-creatures. She had been set aside, kept up and primed with an unconscious sense of her own im portance in the scheme of creation. To be, in all respects, a gentlewoman \u2014 it is hardly necessary to say a Christian gentlewoman \u2014 to give a good example to those beneath her in the social scale, was her principal duty where her neighbours were concerned, since she was too young to do parish work for Mr. Parry, and Miss West had not approved of it for her. This was begging the question that there had been very little money to spare for the poor, apart from the sum which Miss West religiously set apart from her income, and handed over to the Rector to be by him distributed wisely and worthily, as it was part of his calling as a parish priest to distribute it. Anything else was not Constance's business, it was"], [304, "292 A MORNING MIST. the business of other people with which it was not for her to intermeddle. She had found time hang somewhat heavily on her hands. She had a dim perception that she was leading something of the life of a lotus-eater. She arranged her flowers, she ordered (under Miss West's vigilant supervision), received, read, and sent away their library books. She did a little dainty making and mend ing of such small articles of dress as were not consigned without question to the housemaid, who was also the sewing-maid of the establishment. She indulged in moderation what aspirations she had after art-needle work. She managed a little ladylike fancy gardening, in addition to her archery practice in summer. She maintained her solemn pretence of keeping up her languages and music. She was driven in the phaeton by Thomas, in the course of the ladies' daily \"constitu tionals,\" and their slightly more exciting shoppings to Dorrington. This had been practically the whole duty of woman to Constance, and even with the changes of the seasons, to lend the routine a trifle of variety, it had struck even an ignorant, inexperienced young girl, on occasions, that it was a very narrow beaten path of duty. But till the arrival of Sir John, she could hardly have imagined any other daily round. She could scarcely have been said to look forward to anything unless in the shape of the most airy ethereal of day-dreams. She had never been able to prepare for a termination so solid and real, even when invested with rose-hued dyes, as the season of \" coming-out,\" with its stereotyped balls, and gaieties which ought to have been the finish to the educa tion of a girl brought up like her. She had been moderately contented because she possessed, naturally, a sweet, cheerful temper. In spite of the long drawn-out cadences of her small psalm of life, she had found, as she generally believed, sufficient to occupy and exercise her powers in being the true lady she desired to be, in doing to perfection carefully and conscientiously the little things she had to do, for which she was fit, which were fit for her, as she had been taught by Miss West. When Sir John came, making a timely diversion in"], [305, "IN EXILE. 293 the demurely finicking household, Constance had forth with taken as a model of manly virtue and grace the listless, stranded man, engrossed with his self-imposed, sordid task of making both ends meet, and of getting the best for himself by what honourable mean? were left to him out of the bleak track of his life.

To get a mount, when he could, a shot, or a cast with a fly, or a good dinner, when it pre sented itself. To be always handsome, courteous, calm \u2014 these were the whole duties of man in Sir John's case, and he discharged them admirably in his young sister's eyes. Could a gentleman be or do more unless he were so fortunate as to be engaged in the affairs of the State, or on active service with the army, or in a keenly-con tested election in which the patrician side was to triumph as a matter of course ? There was nothing radically ungentle in Constance's arrogance, though she had narrowly escaped being haughty and supercilious. She had not much reason for arrogance, but it is not the more or the less material which either creates the quality or redeems it from its intrinsic meanness and ugliness. She could not be said to rebel, though she felt herself lost in the totally un familiar experience at Kingsmeadows. What a giddy w7hirl the great house, with its large stirring family, pre sented to the half-awake, altogether perplexed, deeply"], [306, "294 A MORNING MIST. depressed stranger set down in their midst ! The head of the house had his absorbing business engagements, which took him constantly to town, his press of work, even when he was at home, and supposed to be idle, his air of unrelaxing diligence \u2014 as different as possible from the leisurely, slumbrous, polished yeoman and game keeper bearing of such county gentlemen as Constance had knowm, since she came to the years of discretion. Nothing save a fine hunting morning, an unexampled run with the hounds, a disgraceful poaching affray, or an earthquake could have roused them to an equal amount of activity, whereas Mr. Hobbs had no time to ride to hounds, could not ride to speak of, and was reckoned not sound on the game-laws. He did not regard his deficient equestrianship as a disgrace, while he left the accomplishment in which he failed, and the fine stud which filled the stables at Kingsmeadows, to young Joe and his friends \u2014 to young Joe, who, without any apology of rudimentary education, or any in ability to ride well, was ready to abuse his privi leges by not stopping to use them, and to slight his opportunities by passing them over wholesale to his friends. In poaching scandals Hobbs pere was too just all-round, in spite of his political unsoundness, to offend his fellow squires by being \"disgustingly lenient,\" but he was quite as much concerned about a factory-strike, or a barrack-brawl, or a street-riot. An earthquake could not have won from him more serious attention than he wasted on the collapse of a drain, or the subsi dence of a farm-building. Young Joe, without his father's onerous engagements and heavy responsibilities, copied them in a second edition, and, for the most part, on behalf of people with whom other people would have said he had nothing to do. He was as much moved by the reports on the sweating system \u2014 which were Latin and Greek to Constance \u2014 as if he himself had been either the sweater or the sweated. The passing, or not passing, of an Act of Parliament, which, as he saw it, would tell strongly on the masses, kept him in agonies of suspense, every time it cropped"], [307, "IN EXILE. 295 up, for weeks and months of the session. He was full of ingenious inventions and bold enterprises\u2014 not so much for the increase of national and individual wealth, as to relieve the crying wants of the million, and to prevent the catastrophe of a second deluge. Looking ahead at the danger, wise men whispered and demagogues thundered, but neither Sir John nor Miss West, nor anybody else had given Constance the slightest intimation of it, for the very good reason that they were deaf and blind to its existence. Joe \"slogged away\" at the work of his innumerable honorary secretaryships no less than at his department in the foundry, till his wife, in her heavy hearted apathy, did not believe there could be physical and mental ability left in him to notice and appreciate the natural and artificial beauty which abounded at Kingsmeadows, or to exchange a token of intelligent sympathy, household affection, or humorous perception with those nearest and dearest to him. Only the most incontestable proofs to the contrary forced her to change her opinion. It seemed as if not a sunset cloud, not an autumn tint escaped him. He appeared to dip, as if by magic, into every book of resounding reputation or hidden merit, which turned up on the groaning bookshelves, book stools, and revolving bookcases in the rooms at Kingsmeadows. His tender consideration for his wife of a few weeks, his delicate homage to her were sleepless and unfailing, and would have been far more conspicuous if she had not resisted and repressed them by every means in her power. He contrived out of the merest fragments and morsels of his over- employed time to have keen, bright arguments with Mattie on every subject under the sun, merry* games with the children, and what were to Constance the most incomprehensible colloquies with his mother, in which the pungency of her speech and the smartness of his repartees would have savoured of the most unpleasant, unbecoming wrangling and quarrelling had the puzzled listener not been compelled to distinguish the grim satisfaction on the brow of the one combatant and the sparkles of fun in the eyes of the other."], [308, "296 A MORNING MIST. Constance did not try to deny that Joe Hobbs was a good fellow, but his restlessness, and what she called his \" fussiness,\" wearied her inexpressibly, while she had only the faintest comprehension of how deep seated they were, else he must have subdued them for her sake, since she did not know that he studied her continually, and was ready to be her slave. The whole house, and every occupant it contained, wearied Constance. The incessant diligence of all the world around her was at once a reproach and a trial to her. The women were as busy as the men. Mrs. Hobbs' voluntary tasks, Mattie's innumerable occupations, were never finished in one sense, any more than the men's were finished. Mattie would come in from her district, to read classics with the particular girl she was coaching gratis in order to pull her through a university examina tion, or she would correct the holiday exercises she had set for the three pupil teachers in the Rector's school, who were looking to her for support and counsel. She would show the younger servants, who were prepar ing for confirmation, the passages and references they ought to read, and think over. She would walk across to the cottage hospital, and take her turn with the nurse in waiting on a troublesome patient. She would answer piles of letters, invitations, inquiries after the characters of servants, appeals from charitable institutions, &c. She would insist on being Joe's private secretary for the afternoon. She would make a toil out of a pleasure by playing tennis till she was ready to drop into the first garden-chair, or by reading some book which a person she could trust had recommended to her, though she had to rise early, or sit late to master its contents. She would ride so far that she had to hurry back, and urge her maid to feats of quick dressing that she might not keep dinner waiting. She had rarely both hands empty. She seldom looked twice in the glass, though she was a young and beautiful woman. She would read or scribble notes while her abigail was doing her hair. Her splendid health carried her through, but sometimes she owned to being dead tired, and would lean back in her chair and"], [309, "I.\\ EXILE. 297 look pale, as if she were confessing to human weakness. But when Constance was roused into saying, \" I don't wonder at it ; I don't believe you have sat still or been idle except when you were at your meals \u2014 if one can call eating idleness\u2014 for an instant this day.\" Then Mattie would laugh, pull herself together again, and protest that it was better to wear out than to rust out. \" It tires me only to look at what you do,\" complained Constance. \" Ah ! you were brought up differently,\" Mattie would explain, with a sigh ; certainly perpetual application agreed with her as a rule, for her vitality and vigour were wonderful. The very children at Kingsmeadows did things with a will \u2014 an overflowing w7ill. They learned their lessons, as surely no other children learned theirs, with au inde fatigable governess, who was a kind of enthusiastic Lieu tenant Littlejohn to Mattie in her multitude of avoca tions. The little people ran off the moment lessons were over to work as hard at play, at devouring children's books, at cleaning and feeding their pets, as if the family energy had no bounds. So far from the Hobbses, old and young, acquiring that last stamp of \"repose\" which is said to be the hall-mark of the rank to which they had risen, Constance often asked herself languidly if it was the working-man's brand of toil which they could not get rid of, or if they could have toiled more unflaggingly supposing they had continued in the poorer order of mechanics and labour ing women, from which they had sprung. She knew all the time she was wrong, that the peculiarity belonged to the people, not to any class. She was shrewd enough to have penetrated to the fact that new-made ladies and gentlemen are, for the most part, inclined to put an excessive value on the privilege of being at liberty to do nothing save eat, drink, and pursue their ideas of pleas ure. She was aware that the poor, over successful, out ofplace souls far more frequently come to grief from a surfeit of idleness and vacuity than from carrying their"], [310, "298 A MORNING MIST. old active habits into their unaccustomed surroundings, and exercising them in unexplored regions. The Hobbses' enthusiasm and endurance were integral parts of them, and had helped to make them what they were. The indomitable race were far too much for Constance \u2014 crushed, wounded, and out of her element. Even the perfect appointments of the great house, the beauty and choiceness of everything which had so sur prised and pleased the girl when she and Miss West had, perforce, lunched with their trading neighbours, oppressed her. She turned with something like loathing from what struck her as dearly-bought luxuries, and sighed, with the waywardness of a sick heart, for the simple, meagre gentility of Maisonette, for its quietness and restfulness, its artless programme of mannerly duties. The two people who troubled Constance least, as she span round aimlessly, with no power of arresting her self, in the whirlpool into which she had been plunged, were Mr. Hobbs and little Bessie. The head of the house was always the same pre-occupied, gravely kind man she had known him to be from the beginning. His pre- occupation was so removed from anything in which she could be supposed to take part, that the effect of what she had considered dull heaviness was a relief from the quicksilver traits of others in the family. Whatever marvels he did in his sphere they were 'beyond her ken, or were not very observable and trying to a girl like her. He did not speak with something like passion of what engrossed him, as young Joe had an alarming tendency to do. Old Joe let people alone. He did not force them to walk, or drive, or go into company. He suffered them to answer him in mono syllables. He did not look miserable because they were silent and dejected ; he simply maintained his quiet ex terior. It seemed to Constance that Mr. Hobbs was the only person at Kingsmeadows who could be quiet. As for Bessie, sturdy and glowing like her mother and sister, the child had a romintic side to her, as Mattie had certainly possessed \u2014 as, perhaps, their mother had also owned \u2014 hidden far away in her homely exterior,"], [311, "IN EXILE. 299 and in the remote distance of her youth. Anyhow, the little drama which had been enacted at Dinglemouth was to be enacted at close quarters at Kingsmeadows. Bessie had fallen deeply in love with Constance the first night she had seen her. She was as much in love \u2014 a bashful, reverential child's love it was \u2014 with her brother's wife as with the strange lady. The little girl was content with the smallest crumbs of notice. She would follow Constance like a faithful little dog, with out asking more than the honour and happiness of following her. Bessie wondered, while she was highly gratified in the middle of her wonder, why her brother Joe would catch her by the hand and raise her on tiptoe just to smooth her hair and kiss her with rapturous fondness. Why he would bring her so many delightful gifts from town when it was not her birthday, and when she had done nothing for which she ought to be specially rewarded. Bessie was Constance's zealous champion in all those secret conclaves of the children when Ben or Hannah, or even Lance Parry, took it upon him, or her, to deliver a candid opinion on the defects and demerits of their last imported relation. Bessie might feel an unconfessed private disappointment because her sister Constance did not care to look at her follower's kitten, or forgot to notice her best frock, or failed to smile when everybody else had laughed at Bessie's performances in a school room charade. In the same way Constance had failed to smile when the boys, with the aid of the pantry-boy, the youngest under-gardener, and the smallest stable-boy, had lit a beautiful bonfire in the middle of the washing green on the night brother Joe brought the new sister home. These were serious and damping acts of obliviousness of which Mattie in her busiest moments had never been guilty. The boys so far forgot them selves as to call Joe's wife a \"stuck-up thing\" in consequence, but Bessie would have died rather than have openly admitted that Constance could do wrong. Constance could not be altogether insensible to the innocent partisanship ; she would clasp the little girl's"], [312, "300 A MORNING MIST. hand, and feel some intangible comfort in her company, in the silent, solitary wanderings in the most secluded parts of the park to which Constance was prone. This was great promotion for Bessie, most honourable, if a trifle dull. At other times, Bessie's paragon would unbend to tell her sad little stories of Constance's lonely youth, and of her dead and gone friend who had been all the world to her. The seasons for cowslip balls, and daisy chains, even for bracelets of the coral-berries of the mountain ash were past, but in lieu of what they could bring Constance would stoop to exercise what little accomplishments of the kind she could claim on Bessie's behalf : she would clip paper dolls, doll's furniture, and boats, and she would weave artistic bead rings, which the grateful recipient held to be far superior to Mattie's circlets of diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires. Constance was separated from her husband by more than one barrier. She retained the unwarrantable grudge, amounting to rankling resentment, against him which she had adopted, along with the conviction that he had taken advantage of her and her brother in press ing his suit immediately after Miss West's death, and just prior to the breaking up of the establishment at Maison ette. At the same time, Constance's conscience was not easy where Joe Hobbs was concerned. From Mattie Hobbs Constance was drifting further apart, instead of the two drawing more closely together, which would have been Constance's great chance of sal vation. Mattie's many engagements in which Constance could not join were not altogether to blame for this \u2014 neither was the growing estrangement produced princi pally by the gulf between the egotistical, dreaming girl and the self-forgetful, practical young woman. Mattie's nature w*as big enough and sympathetic enough to have bridged across the gulf, but the truth was Constance was committing an offence against Mattie which threatened to turn even a wholesome heart to gall, and to render Mattie Hobbs herself unfair and unkind. It was not enough that the \"little lady\" of former days should"], [313, "IN EXILE. 301 come among the Hobbses with unconcealed reluctance, without hiding that they were antipathetic to her, and that she saw herself demeaned by being condemned to cast in her lot with theirs. It was not enough that she should reject all their good offices and tenders of regards, that she should evidently hold them in her well-bred, dainty, girlish way as Mrs. Hobbs had prophesied she would, like so much dirt beneath her feet, with Mrs. Hobbs the most objectionable dirt of all. It was not enough that she should have consented to avail herself of the Hobbses' assistance to deliver her and her brother from their strait w7hile she could never view them as on terms of equality with herself and Sir John, and kept hugging the calamity which had reduced her to avail herself of their help. It was not even enough that she had brought disunion where only union had prevailed hitherto. Mattie could have borne all this, could have laughed and sighed over it, and still sought with wise patience and gentleness to have brought Constance to her right mind. But there was still more in the back. ground. If there was one person in existence whom Mattie loved above all others, even beyond her father and mother, it was her brother Joe, her confidant, her backer and supporter in all her best aims. To have Joe's life blighted, as Mattie feared it would be, by the silliness and smallness of a dotingly pre judiced girl, to see his great love wasted and flung away, to know that he was being gradually severed from her, his life-long friend and sister, whose love had never failed him, simply because she could not brook to witness his subjection and the worse than indifference with which it was received \u2014 all this Mattie could not bear. She could no longer join him in being persistently blind to the clay feet of his idol. She dreaded desperately the utter frustration of all the high hopes which had been centred in Joe. To dwell on the thought that she had taken any part in bringing about the tragedy almost sent her strong mind off its balance. It was the utmost Mattie could do to keep silence, to let herself grow cold, dry, and stiff to the couple, since"], [314, "302 A MORNING MIST. Joe insisted on sharing any treatment which was dealt out to his wife. Mrs. Hobbs was not so disturbed and distressed by the latent atmosphere of alienation and strife which had replaced the old friendly peace that had before environed the family. This was partly, perhaps, because she had foreseen it when it was no bigger than the little cloud the size of a man's hand, and forewarned is forearmed, with the additional consolation of being able to say, with out the possibility of contradiction, \"I told you so.\" But the result was also due to the fact that Mrs. Hobbs, with all her w*orth, w*as a woman of harder, coarser fibre than Mattie was a girl, or even than young Joe was a man. Hers was one of those natures which has a grim delight in making ready for battle, which sniffs conflict and carnage from afar, and has a certain stern satisfac tion in it. She was, as she would have said, \" main sorry \" for her lad. He had been as much her pride, the excellency of his mother's glory and strength, as he had been his father's. She loved him all the better, as she loved his father, for those qualities in him which were beyrond her, which she only partially comprehended. The strain of womanliness in an otherwise manly young fellow had specially endeared him to the mother whose own womanliness was of so robust a type as to partake of the masculine character. It gave her endless pangs to have, as she said, lost young Joe. She was in a less degree sorry for herself \u2014 to be afflicted with a daughter-in-law like Mrs. Joe. She was, in Mrs. Hobbs' eyes, an idle, useless, fine lady, without heart, or spirit, or sense, w7ho would not consent to be happy, though a bountiful Providence had loaded her with benefits, of which thousands of her more deserving fellow-creatures were destitute. Was she not living at Kingsmeadows ? Had she not the finest young fellow in the world for her husband? To a woman of Mrs. Hobbs' ceaseless industry it was a positive torment to contemplate Constance's dawdling ways, her listless in action. Moreover, Mrs. Hobbs' activity was not inag-"], [315, "IN EXILE. 303 gressive like Mattie's, which was one reason why Mattie, in spite of her diligent perseverance in well-doing, was as well liked as if she had been idle and careless, in no light a tacit reproach to her slothful, self-indulgent neighbours. Mrs. Hobbs' activity bristled all over with instincts of assault, and a fiery longing to take the Castle of Indolence by storm. To crown all other motives, she was perfectly sensible that Mrs. Joe despised and detested her mother-in-law. But that was a com paratively7 small matter. Mrs. Hobbs' disposition was not one that shrank and sickened under injustice and unkindness. These rather stimulated her to vindicate herself. Withal, Mrs. Hobbs kept her word to Mattie and to herself. She was not wanting in any outward mark of respect to her son's wife. She would have dis dained to complain of her either to friend or foe. She refrained from openly assailing her or interfering with her, and that was to say a great deal for Mrs. Hobbs. Rustic, restive, and dictatorial she might be, but she did understand, better than many a blander woman understood, what was meant by the sanctity of the parental roof, what was due to old Joe and young Joe, to herself no less than to Constance. She would not stoop to actual warfare writh any member of her family. She would not render the only home the girl had un tenable for her. That the truce stopped short there is but to say that Mrs. Hobbs was human, was primitive, was a rough diamond She spoke at Constance, if not to her. She pointed many a moral and adorned many a tale, indirectly, with sarcastic parodies of Mrs. Joe and her behaviour. Oh ! how* Constance writhed under what she ranked as low, underbred persecution. How she hated the vulgar title \" Mrs. Joe,\" which Mrs. Hobbs invariably gave her \u2014 a \" Mrs. Joe Hobbs ! \" Had Constance Beauchamp sunk to that ? It was a trifle light as air. In substance a \" Mrs. Regy \" or a \" Mrs. Bertie\" would have been the same, but they would have sounded less odious. She had always disliked the names Joseph and Samuel, in spite of patriarch and prophet. When"], [316, "304 A MORNING MIST. it came to that, the numerous low-born Englishmen who had borne them latterly had been quite distinct from patriarchs and prophets. Mrs. Hobbs, who had gone to Constance in her sorrow, who had watched over her as if the girl had been the elder woman's daughter, was her bete noire, her gorgon's head. The familiar spectacle of Mrs. Hobbs sitting at the head of her splendidly appointed table, dressed like a lady, but looking like a working-housekeeper, using aboriginal words, and indulging in atrocious grammar, to which her family, nay, her obsequious or infatuated guests, listened unmoved, as to a racy, picturesque variety on the speech of ordinary educated people, haunted Constance, even when she was not exposed to the sight and sound, like a nightmare. She seemed to see the clasped hands and bony knuckles on the table before her, to hear the somewhat strident voice calling her son Joe \" an imperent scoundrel,\" and her daughter Mattie \" a hair-brained silly, a regular trapester,\" for all the prizes she had taken at her schools, and the money her education had cost. Or Mrs. Hobbs would jeer at Constance herself, with merciless if slightly veiled malice. \"What do you say, Martha Hobbs?\" her mother would ask, incredulously. \" Mason's youngest daughter has drawed up with his assistant, and the penniless pair are engaged to be married ! Now I call that fair imper- ence on her side. A pretty-like wife will her make ! She may have had a training for a scholard, but she have had none for a housekeeper.\" \" Celia Mason will learn, mother,\" Mattie's bel'.-like voice rang out cheerfully. \" I hope the old notion is exploded that knowledge in one line shut3 out other kinds of knowledge, or that to use the head must needs cripple the hands. \" \" There's one good thing,\" went on Mrs. Hobbs, with great decision, \" it is a sight better for them both that they have time to think, and get acquaint, and learn one another's w7rong sides. It do rile me when a couple of simpletons puts their heads in a halter, on the spur of the moment, without drawing breath.\""], [317, "IN EXILE. 305 There was an awkward pause, whereupon Mrs. Hobbs resumed her moralising, with her eyes still gleam ing : \" And it is a sight better that Celia have took up with a plain honest saw-bones, like her father, rather than have thought to look up, which mostly means to go a good few steps lower down. I don't go with high fliers. I never did, since once, first when I was married to my master there, I was fool enough to employ a mangle-woman who had come down in the world, and was too fine for her trade, but would let the things get crumpled and torn, or not do them at all, while she sat nursing her useless hands.\" Then Joe would wince, as well as frown, and Mattie would colour, Mr. Hobbs would stir uneasily in his seat, and Constance would wish she could sink through the floor, and never come up again, which was a more prosaic and deadly earnest w*ay of desiring that she had the wings of a dove to flee away, and be at rest. Sir John had said that if a rich woman was not a sloven, or a fool, she would be acceptable in the best society of her day \u2014 all the more acceptable because she did not hide the original light of her ignorance and independence. Mrs. Hobbs was as fastidiously clean and well-nigh painfully tidy as one finds certain women of every rank. She knew and complied with the laws of polite society in sitting and standing, eating and drinking. So far from being the \" silly \" she had styled Mattie, she was full of rude shrew7dness and caustic wit, which might 'attract and entertain people, but which were nevertheless repulsive in the extreme to the faithful pupil of the formal gentlewoman Miss West; and, as in many cases, the pupil outran the teacher, for Miss West, endowed with riper wit and larger experience, had, on the whole, held a favourable opinion of Mrs. Hobbs, and had gauged the entire woman far more truly than Constance was doing. Sometimes a horrible suspicion, founded on the flippant remarks which Constance had overheard at the Hunt Ball, crossed her mind. Was the manner in which her marriage with Joe Hobbs had been brought about part of 20"], [318, "306 A MORNING MIST. a deeply-laid plot to which immediate action was given by the death of Miss West ? Was there a project still on foot, though kept warily in the background, to accom plish the double alliance which had been mentioned in Constance's hearing ? Was Mattie Hobbs to be given to Sir John Beauchamp just as Constance had been given to Joe Hobbs ? Was a Hobbs to be invested with the name and title of the head of an ancient house ? Con stance laughed with bitter scorn at the idea. He was her Sir John still, though he had failed her signally. To think of him with his deliberate suavity and slow dignity, his sufficiency for himself, his system of non interference with the world at large, tied to a Mattie Hobbs, who was brisk, if not brusque, w7ho could never let well alone ! \" My dear,\" Joe had once been tempted to remind his wife, when she had briefly aired her theory of masterly inactivity, and abstinence from all action where her neighbours were concerned, \"we are not all equally trained and equipped. The most of us are like big children. Are the grown-up men aud women to stand by and see the children stumble, fall, and be trodden underfoot in the fight, without lending them a helping hand, even though one misses a hunting morning to do it ? Have you forgotten who it was that defended him self by the defiant answer, ' Am I my brother's keeper ? ' \" But Joe might as well have addressed himself to strike down a solid stone wall by a gentle thrust of the hand as have expected to influence Constance by such a mild remonstrance at this date. Constance was not more than three-fourths mad with pride, sorrow, and sudden overthrow. She did not really believe for above a moment or two at a time that Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs and Mattie had used her and Joe as tools to bring about a second and more illustrious marriage between Mattie's portion and Sir John's rank. And the young wife never believed in her inmost heart that her husband had anything to do with it. She had the double consciousness of some sick people, who, while they can persuade themselves that they have been"], [319, "307 IN EXILE. hardly dealt with and are the most hapless of victims, yet retain an undercurrent of sanity which tells them at intervals that somehow they are making a great mistake, for after all they are receiving much kindness and in dulgence, and are being borne with, screened, and saved in a manner which goes far beyond their deserts."], [320, "CHAPTER XXIV. AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. The autumn had worn on to mid-winter, which is felt in Oxfordshire as keenly as in many places in the United Kingdom. The central situation of the county causes the extremes of heat and cold which a sea border modifies. The extent to which the population beyond the university city, and one or more towns with a certain amount of modern enterprise, is given over to agricultural operations causes their suspension, or the difficulty with which they are carried on, to be generally felt. Snow sometimes lies undrifted to a depth of upwards of two feet, and in the hollows where several of the towns hide away there is a filling up of the cavities with a white stuffing which railway engines and snow ploughs find it no easy matter to penetrate. There is a good deal of suffering in many of the villages which are out of date in the extent of their dependence on the manor houses, the rectories and vicarages, and those larger farmhouses in which some amount of rough plenty still survives the long agricultural depression. Altogether, winter is a more stranding and depressing season in Oxfordshire than in most of the country places which the multiplication of means of communication on every side, and the increase of industrial resources, have delivered from psriodical stagnation and pinching poverty. Of course, there is the daily or bi-weekly journey to London for men of business resident in the county ; but London in winter, even with its roar, struggle, and traffic, to dispel dulness and lethargy, is not the most"], [321, "AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 309 cheerful locality in the world to a sensitive, tried soul. There is also the occupation and excitement of the hunt, when the frost will permit, to the gentleman, who make it the business of their lives. But there are gentlemen, young as well as old, who, though none can deny that they lide well to hounds and are in at the death, when they are so minded and luck favours them, who cannot make the hunting- field their arena, and young Joe Hobbs was one of them. Joe could stand the situation at Kingsmeadows no longer ; and he was afraid matters would not improve, though the house for which he was on the look-out, about which Constance never offered a single suggestion, were to turn up the next day. His wife's continued sadness and isolation distressed him beyond measure ; she would not even accept the relief and variety which might have been afforded her by going into the society around her. As the last bride in the county circle to which the great boiler-maker's family were admitted, in vitations, which were given specially in honour of the young couple, fell as thickly on Constance at Kings meadows as they had been absent from her experience at Maisonette. Nobody at Kingsmeadows washed any thing else than that Constance should accept her share of these invitations, go to the neighbours' houses, and look her best in whatever finery she chose to order from town for the occasion. Nobody, not even Mrs. Hobbs, would have grudged her any pleasure she might derive from the proceeding. But Constance had elected that Miss West, who would never have dreamt of such a dubious compliment, should receive all the acknow ledgment of her loss from her pupil that is usually accorded to the death of the nearest relative. By not a day or an hour would \" Mrs. Joe \" shorten the season of retirement, and mourning which fitted in with her own humour. Unfortunately, there was nobody of sufficient importance and audacity among her neigh bours to break through the barrier imposed upon them. Lady Theresa Langton, who might have done some thing in this respect, was gone abroad till the spring."], [322, "310 A MORNING MIST. But these were mere outward grievances, of small account to Joe compared to the fact of the passive resistance which Constance persisted in offering to his most cautious, anxiously thought out, loving efforts to win her confidence and affection. She vexed him sorely also by her apparently utter indifference to all the human interests to which he was fervently devoted. The com bined rebuffs went far to break his heart. Joe Hobbs began to think that his wife would end by hating him. He craved temporary respite from the purgatory into which he had plunged himself and another. A change would be something to be thankful for, even if it did no permanent good. The boiler-making firm had great contracts at this time between the firm and the Government in Canada, with which Joe had also much correspondence in connection with his emigration scheme. He suddenly made up his mind to become for the time his father's agent at Quebec and Montreal, and to undertake a personal superin tendence of such emigration settlements as he had on hand. His father approved ; old Joe in his Zeus attitude was aware that there was something wrong with young Joe in bis recent matrimonial relations ; but not only was it impossible for a man who had boilers to guarantee and send out to all the four quarters of the globe to give his attention to domestic imbroglios, these were young Joe's concern, and, perhaps, a judicious absence was not a bad plan for cutting the gordian knot in this instance. Joe's mother said nothing, which was a wonderful repres sion of feeling on her part, almost as wonderful as her silence in the church on the morning when her lad was married \u2014 and done for. Mattie was full of remonstrances, regrets, futile suggestions of accompanying her brother. The very children were ready to go into mourning at the prospect of brother Joe's departure for an indefinite length of time. Only his wife made no sign that she would miss him, while he w*as full of anxious consideration for her comfort and happiness when he was gone. And his going was no mere selfish flight from personal annoy ances; he was persuaded, though the persuasion was"], [323, "AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 311 an additional pang, that his leaving might be for her advantage in her present circumstances. Her health had not been good latterly ; perhaps she would be better and happier when he was no longer there to worry her with his unwelcome attentions. What would he not give to see her restored to the old condition of girlish contentment and iight-heartedness in which she had been when he first met her? The conviction that he had robbed her even of that narrow kingdom was intolerable to him. He could not resent, as it was evident Mattie thought he ought, and did her part in resenting for him, Constance's insensibility to his regard. She had never pretended to return his love; he had taken her unwon, and he had no right to reproach her, though she should remain so to the end of their lives. If there mingled with Joe's other and more disinte rested views a lurking, wistful hope that Constance might miss him, after all, might write in another tone from that in which she spoke to him, might go so far as to hint at his return, might welcome him back \u2014 who shall blame him ? In the meantime Sir John Beauchamp had come on a visit, ostensibly of leave-taking, in the prospect of his return to India. It was like those last appearances of actors and singers which are proverbial for being re peated times without number. Alas ! even to his pre sence Constance had grown indifferent, or, rather, she shunned his company, as if she feared that she might hear something she would not like to hear \u2014 that he would remonstrate with her on her lack of appreciation of the good things with which she was surrounded. Could she have done better ? What would she have had? If she had known it, he did not take much notice of the state of affairs where she was concerned. He overlooked a great deal ; but he seemed perfectly well, and was more alive and alert than the Hobbs had ever known him. He was positively animated and ex cited \u2014 for Sir John\u2014 in the middle of his preoccupation. There had been a couple of weeks of frost too severe to admit of any thought of runs with the hounds, and in"], [324, "312 A MORNING MIST. order to replace the usual resource it had been ar ranged that the younger members of the family, with their guest, should go into Oxford to see the grand dis play of skating on the Isis, now that the men were up again after Christmas. Mrs. Joe was of the party, since she could not well refuse to go with her brother on so simple an expedition ; so was Joe, of course, and Mattie, with Miss Gerard, the governess, and the children. The party was so large that it required some power of organisation to get its members into marching order, as Sir John called it, and convey them first to the nearest railway station, and then to Portmeadow and the river. But the scene was worth the trouble. The ice was like glass. The meadows and the wooded banks were lovely under their silvery winter tracery as under their summer \"bravery.\" The Cityof Towers in thebackground was as venerable and picturesque as the heart of man could desire. The rapidly-moving groups of erudite pro- fessors, gay \"undergrads,\" and ladies just tinged with the learning of their lords, were full of spirit and grace. Both Joe and Mattie Hobbs were skilled skaters. Joe skated particularly well, as well as he danced, and he was tempted to execute all his skater's feats, not so much for the admiration of the beholders as with a forlorn hope that, after everything else more solid and worthy of esteem had been tried and had failed, his wife might condescend to approve of this light-heeled accomplish- ment. Mattie strove to rein in her satisfaction in indulging once more in the old familiar exercise with Joe for her partner, as the two had once practised it on the Dutch canals in a happy winter trip to Holland. But how could she let herself be in exuberant spirits with Joe glum, even when he was racing like the wind, or cutting the quaintest figures on the ice ? She had to take refuge from the sight of his glumness in suffering herself to be absorbed by her many acquaintances among university men and women, and the members of country-house parties like that from Kingsmeadows. As may be supposed, Constance had not been taught to skate, and she said she had no wish to sit down on any"], [325, "313 AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. of the chairs provided for the purpose, and let herself be pushed along the ice by a cavalier in the shape of a skater ; otherwise one skating cavalier would have been only too glad to renounce his more elaborate perform- ances in order to put himself at her service. She insisted that she did very well walking aud standing about with Miss Gerard, who, luckily for Constance, was also not a skater. Miss Gerard was, of course, polite and obliging to the daughter-in-law of her employers, but she could not respond to Mrs. Joe's assertion of her good luck in finding such a companion, by a counter declaration that her own star was likewise in the ascendant. On the contrary, Miss Gerard thought it was tolerably tiresome to have to lend her modest countenance to a disconsolate bride, of all persons, and pined to be on the track of her friend and patroness, the universally interested, all-con- quering Mattie. How could Miss Gerard, who was an exceedingly bright, successful, straightforward damsel, guess for an instant that Mrs. Joe, in the perversity of a mind ill at ease, was classing herself with the reasonable, well-satisfied young governess? How could Miss Gerard divine that Mrs. Joe was linking their names, and, in a sense, their lots together \u2014 was telling herself that she, a Beauchamp, and the retainer of the boiler- maker's household were two interlopers who had neither part nor lot in the business and pleasures of the others ? Miss Gerard would have been very sorry to think that she had neither part nor lot in Miss Hobbs's business and pleasures ; Miss Gerard would have regretted to find herself guilty of taking such an absurd, lackadaisical idea into her sensible, well balanced head. Sir John could skate a little without caring much for the sport. His dexterity simply sufficed to enable him to propel, by turns, Bessie, her sister Hannah, and some playmates they had encountered, in a small sledge he had picked up. The little girls looking roguishly pretty in their plush suits, were very proud of their tall charioteer, if that was the proper name for him, and proofs were not wanting that he felt some relish for his self-imposed task, in the grave patience with which"], [326, "314 A MORNING MIST. he complied with all the eager requests and funny advice addressed to him. Poor Joe's brilliant antics were thrown away, like his weightier achievements ; not so Sir John's attentions to the children. Every matron on the ice who knew him, or had him pointed out to her, heaped praises on his good nature. What was of more consequence, Mattie Hobbs held that he merited a cordial acknowledgment of the trouble he had taken. Her blood was still glowing and tingling with the rapid motion in the frosty air, and with the agreeable interlude of hailing and being hailed by a host of friends \u2014 for she was above all things a friendly woman \u2014 when, as she and Sir John Beauchamp led the way in the walk back to the station, she began the tete-a-tete by thanking him with frank warmth for the pleasure he had given to Bessie and the others. As it happened, Sir John had been screwing up his courage for the last forty-eight hours to make a supreme effort, and this seal to the unexpected golden opinions he had been earning gave him the necessary impetus. \" I don't call that goodness,\" he said, hurriedly ; \" your own amiable nature is lending far too fine a colour to what is not worth speaking of, to what was little better than sheer selfishness. I am not a very social beggar, as your penetration must have discovered long ago. I am not like you, Miss Hobbs, but I am fond of children \u2014 nice children, like your sisters and their com panions. That is true enough. At the same time, is there no other motive to which you can attribute the small obligation which I had the good fortune to confer on the young people? \" She started and stared w7ith a disturbed air. Her rich colour paled a little under her velvet hat, while she had a guilty recollection of some of her mother's speeches. \" Oh dear ! oh dear 1 what is this ? \" she was saying to herself, \" what is coming to spoil everything \u2014 and there, we have already outstripped the others.\" He was never quick or fluent ; he did not observe the change in her expression, while he continued to address her in sentences which grew each instant jerkier and"], [327, "AN INOPTORTUNE PROPOSAL. 315 more agitated. \" Did it not occur to you that the very little I could do to amuse the children might be done for somebody else's sake ? \u2014 that I might have an ulterior motive, considering the short time that is left to me, and the few means I have of recommending myself to a young lady whom I have admired from the first moment I saw her ? \" \" Sir John, stop ! Do not say another word !\" Mattie forbade him, imperiously. Her cheeks were flaming again, her eyes were beginning to flash. \" I will not hear it \u2014 I cannot hear it ! \" \" WThat ! You will not even listen to me ! \" exclaimed Sir John, in such genuine astonishment and slow per- plexity that they would have been ludicrous if the situa- tion had not been painful. \" No ; I will not listen,\" said Mattie, in a white heat of exasperation, very unlike her usual geniality. \"Is what you and your sister have done not enough ? The mischief you have wrought which will never be remedied. Is it not enough that you have made Joe, my dear brother Joe, a miserable man ? He is so single-hearted and generous, worth a hundred of any of us, worth \u2014 you will forgive me for speaking plainly, since I, too, am come of rude people \u2014 all the gentle Beauchamps I ever heard of ; and you are driving him out of the country, his individual life wrecked, all his hopes, all our hopes for him, grievously frustrated.\" \" Upon my w*ord, Miss Hobbs ! \" said Sir John, with a gasp, standing still for a second, since the spectacle of Mattie Hobbs in a rage was what he had not bargained for. He had sufficient self-control to move on the next instant and to speak calmly, if stiffly, in the annoyance and affront which even his quiet, sluggish nature could not altogether ccnceal. \" 1 was not aware of such a catastrophe. I did not know that my sister was such a formidable perse n. Even if your brother and she do not bit it off well together, of which, however, I have not been told, I do not see that I am accountable for the misadventure. Your brother was bent on the mar riage- \""], [328, "316 A MORNING MIST. \" You ought never to have permitted it,\" she inter rupted him again, hotly. \" You must have known that your sister's affections were not engaged. How dared you consent to run such a risk for her and Joe ? Yes, it was your doing, for my poor Joe was blinded, and your sister \u2014 well, the best that can be said for her is that she was a child in experience, if not in years. She had accustomed herself to look down on all of us because we were not born Beauchamps, and are in trade ; she looks down upon us still, and holds herself wronged and degraded because she has been made one of us. Yet you can think of asking me to become a Beauchamp, to renounce my honest name \u2014 which no kith or kin of mine has ever sullied \u2014 and take your title as an indemnification for all the evil that has been done. You can propose to me to give an assurance to every body concerned and to the world at large of how satis fied I am with the melancholy state of matters, and how disinterested I was in not protesting more strenuously than I did against the reckless haste of your sister's mar riage with my brother. Poor Miss West, who was so careful and decorous 1 it might make her turn in her grave if she could know the folly and wickedness her death brought about.\" Still it was a Bellona in velvet and seal-skin, and not a gracious, friendly Mattie Hobbs, who walked by the side of the betrayed soldier. \" If there were haste and recklessness, not to say folly and wickedness, in the marriage,\" said Sir John, dog gedly, \" why visit them all on me ? Your father and mother were consenting parties to the contract which you are denouncing in such unwarrantably strong terms. If they had not consented from the first, I should cer tainly not have allowed the marriage to goon.\" \" They did not aud could not know your sister and her feelings as you knew or ought to have known them. They only meant to be fair and kind to their son and his choice. They did not wish him to make it in such a distinguished quarter, incredible as it may sound to you. They would have been equally ready and willing to re-"], [329, "AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 317 ceive any true-hearted working girl \u2014 such as my mother was when she married my father. The exalted opinion which your sister \u2014 and you also, to judge by your con duct to-day \u2014 entertain of the Beauchamps is not necessarily held by your neighbours. Nothing on earth would induce me to change my name for that of Beau champ.\" \" You need not be alarmed, you will not be urged, you will never again be asked to take so distasteful and derogatory a step,\" said Sir John, his head in the air, and his voice half-choked with contending feelings. \" The Lady Beauchamps of the last generation were not such enviable and honourable women as to lead one to covet the distinction of being their successor,\" she was goaded into telling him; but she could have bitten her tongue out when she saw how white he grew, and how the hand which was tugging \u2014 not stroking \u2014 his chestnut moustache shook. \" And you consider me also to blame for that ?\" he said, in a low tone. \"It does not enter into your reckoning, it seems, that the innocent may be called upon to suffer for the guilty.\" He had silenced her ; she was quivering with shame and remorse \u2014 sensations strange to Mattie Hobbs. He was so unwise as to renew the controversy7 by attempting to defend himself from the main charge. \" You think I ought not to have consented to the im mediate marriage of my sister, whose reasonableness I had then no cause to doubt, with your brother, who was my friend, for whom I had the greatest esteem. You forget the difficulty of the position. I had not a spare penny to bless myself with, which, I confess,\" broke off Sir John in fresh confusion, \"ought to have been a powerful argument against my presuming to address you as I did a few minutes ago. However, that is all over, and the confession may tell in two ways, I take it. What was I to do with Constance ? I could not take her out to India, I could not go out there myself and keep her at home. If I quitted the army on her account it was the suicidal destruction of what chances in life remained to"], [330, "A MORNING MIST. 318 me. I declare to you your brother's proposal, expressing, as it did, his regard for Constance, seemed in every way unobjectionable, and was like an interposition of Providence.\" Her downcast eyes kindled anew with wrath and scorn, and were hfted and turned full on him. \" An interposi tion of Providence, indeed ! Rather, a temptation of the devil. How can you hammer on at such a poor excuse ? Do you think Joe would not have found a way to main tain me if I had been left destitute on his hands, without the capacity to support myself, and he with nothing else to depend upon save his brains and his hands ? Do you think he would have been glad to shuffle off his responsi bility, or would have called it an interposition of Providence when he had the opportunity of turning me over, an unwilling and loveless wife, on the man he called his friend? Oh! if I were a man, I should prefer a thousand times breaking stones by the side of the road to sailing under false colours.\" \"I do not understand you,\" he said, very coldly. \"You do understand me, whether you admit it to yourself or not,\" she said, impatiently. \"I had rather strip myself of every handle to my name, every attribute of gentle birth and breeding, and go and herd cattle and sheep in the bush, or dig in the gold-fields. If even then I could not better my condition, provide for my own flesh and blood, and yield to the kindly charities of life, I should, at least, have the comfort of knowing that I bad not demeaned myself to shifts and subterfuges \u2014 that I was in no way a sham.\" It was all said \u2014 all that had been rankling and seeth ing in her breast for weeks before he came back to Kings meadows. It could never be unsaid, and the awkward thing was that he would not cease, from that moment, to be an acquaintance, a friend after a fashion, a connec tion of the family. He had tried her forbearance, her tolerance, her genuine courtesy, too far. She had spoken, as her mother might have spoken under similar provo cation. More than that, they had left the meadows some distance behind them. They were entering the"], [331, "AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 319 railway territory, mounting a stony, slippery little hill, traversing the region of tramcar and cab, approaching the station, where the lamps were already fit, and looked like fog-signals in the frosty haze. At that instant Joe's impatient voice reached the couple, who had latterly been posting along as if the furies were behind them. \"Mattie, Beauchamp, do you think we can all walk as if we were walking for a wager ? The children cannot keep up with you. If we are too late for the train we can wait till the next comes in ; there is no need to be in such a beastly hurry.\" If he had been quite frank in his remonstrance he would have added, in accents of keenest reproach, \" Neither can my poor Constance walk at this mad rate. Don't you see she is falling to pieces, though she will keep hold of Miss Gerard's arm instead of taking mine, which would be of more use to her.\" There was nothing for it but for Mattie to slacken her headlong pace and present to the inquiring company coming up behind her the girl's scorched, tear-stained cheeks, for she had cried a little in her anger and vexa tion \u2014 nothing for it but to sit opposite Sir John in the railway carriage and waggonette. She had to see, with out being able to prevent it, how much he had to put up with from Sam and Ben, who had been taking first lessons in skating, and were tired and disposed to quarrel over their precious skates, to which they clung, swinging the glittering objects of dispute into dangerous proximity with the boys themselves and their com panions. She had to see how he was teased by Bessie and Hannah, who were also tired and cross, for whom the buns and milk with which the little girls had been supplied while their seniors drank their cups of tea, had by no means replaced sufficiently the schoolroom meals. These inconsiderate youngsters for some incom prehensible reason, in place of falling on their official keeper, or throwing themselves on their natural prey, Joe and Mattie, or even making raids on Constance, on whom they had some claim, chose to sit upon the un fortunate Sir John. Mattie would have laughed at the"], [332, "320 A MORNING MIST. contretemps at any other time, but to.night it was horri ble. Besides, it enabled her late antagonist to heap coals of fire on her head. For was he not as friendly to his oppressors as ever ? And did he not make them the means of interchanging some slightly awkward, common place civilities with their elder sister, which was a spas modic sign on his part that he did not dream of retalia ting on her what had really been her abominable treat ment of him? If she had forgotten that she was a lady, he had not forgotten that he was a gentleman. If she had been shamefully oblivious of the fact that he was her father's guest as well as her sister-in-law's brother, he had not lost sight of it. She had been grossly rude, really, when she came to think of it, barbarously cruel to a man who had only acted according to the standard of such men and of their public. In their estimation what did such workers as her father found great busi nesses and heap up large fortunes for ? What did rich girls such as she was exist for save to benefit impecunious scions of old families \u2014 as they called themselves\u2014 needy officers like Sir John Beauchamp and his fellows ? There she was, at it again in her own mind, behind his back, as it were, lashing with scorpions a poor stupid fellow who knew no better. Mercenary ? Oh, yes ; de testably mercenary ; but what right had she to expect anything else from him ? He might be a tiresome mar tinet, still he was a gentleman, according to his light. She wished she could tell herself that she had been a lady according to hers, and not a scolding vixen. Both her father and mother \u2014 not to speak of Joe \u2014 liked Sir John, and were indulgent to his failings. She was not sure that he was not more honourable than she was, so determined was he to hide the wounds she had given to his vanity and self-respect, and to save her from the con sequences of what she had done by looking her in the face and behaving as if nothing had happened. She was persuaded that he cherished no more resentment against her than he showed, which proved his superiority. It had been intolerable, well-nigh insulting, in him to address her as he had done without any approach to love pas-"], [333, "AN INOPPORTUNE PROPOSAL. 321 sages between them, without the slightest encourage ment on her part of a kind w7hich could warrant him in speaking to her in such a fashion. He had looked upon her probable portion as a crutch on which his crippled fortunes could rest. She might have seemed to him another interposition of Providence on behalf of the favoured Beauchamps. But there, if he had behaved badly, so had she, very badly, she was afraid ; unlike a lady, which was bad ; with unwomanly bitterness, which was worse ; with unchris tian malice and vindictiveness, which was worst of all. She chafed and fretted under the convictiou. Nemesis comes quickly to candid, rnagnan:mou\"<, tender natures like that of Mattie Hobbs. 21"], [334, "CHAPTER XXV THE TRUTH. At the time of Constance's marriage and afterwards, on the plea of her recent loss and of her being out of health, she had not only been exempted from visiting, she had been excused from helping nominally to entertain company at Kingsmeadows when she was supposed not to be equal for the effort. There were people at dinner on the evening of the skating at Oxford, and Constance did not appear, on the ground of fatigue. Not even the consideration that Sir John was among the guests could induce her to dress and join the others, when she had so fair an apology for moping listlessly in her room. If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the mountain. Sir John had told Mrs. Hobbs when he came with the other gentlemen to the drawing room, \" If you will allow me, I will go and sit with my sister for ten minutes, since I shall not be with her much longer.\" \"As you like, Sir John,\" replied the lady; \"there ain't a better plan for getting your own way, and being run after, than to set up for a half-and-half invalid.\" Undeterred by this home thrust at her daughter-in-law \u2014 for that matter, Sir John took all Mrs. Hobbs's thrusts in good part \u2014 he found his way to his sister's sitting-room, which neither she nor any one else at Kingsmeadows would call her boudoir. Mattie had a similar room, which she styled her parlour, saying that she preferred a room which showed that it had its origin in people speaking to each other ; the other plainly had its rise in solitary sulking. After all, Mattie's was rather"], [335, "THE TRUTH. 323 a working room than a speaking room, and the typical boudoir w7ould have been put to shame by its plain furniture. But what had Sir John to do with any room of Mattie Hobbs's ? Nothing more than to shun it thence forth with all his might. In contradistinction to Mattie's parlour, Constance's was an elegant little nest in the best taste, furnished with a hundred graceful devices and pretty nicknacks, put there with the hope of diverting her mind and grati fying her fancy, when the room was fitted up for its mistress. When Sir John knocked and was bidden enter, he found his sister still iu her heavy mourning dress, lying back in the perfection of a small feminine lounge, hold ing in her hand a book, of which she had been only turning over the pages. \" Connie ! \" he said, with a slight inflection of reproach in his half-jesting tone, \"was this the manner in which Miss West taught you to spend your time ? \" \" Oh ! those days are over,\" she answered, with a slight contraction of her smooth, white forehead, but she was not so forgetful of the time w*hen Sir John had been her prince and paladin as not to bestir herself for his delecta tion. \" It is very good of you to look me up here, John, when whatever is going on in the drawing-room must at least be more lively than a humdrum chat with me. Have you had coffee or tea? I dare say you have \u2014 everything is so desperately well attended to, as well as so superlatively excellent here \u2014 but if not, please ring and ask for what you wish. Won't you have a glass of seltzer ? That was a request which my poor, dear Miss West always made with some doubt and reservation, great as was her faith in you. I think that she had a notion that it was a step towards a brandy and soda.\" \" Nothing, thanks,\" he answered, without making any response to the small attempt at a pleasantry got up for his sake. \" I only wish to speak to you,\" continued Sir John, abstractedly, and he remained standing b3fore the exquisitely tiled little hearth, his hands in his pockets,"], [336, "324 MORNING MIST. his head bent, a rigid look stealing over his handsome face. Constance was reminded painfully of that stroll in the autumn garden of Maisonette, from whose gates Miss West had passed out for ever, that conversation in which her brother had seen fit to lay before her the emptiness of his purse, the ruin which the mere fact of her exist ence had been to him, together with Joe Hobbs's pro posal, when her fate was sealed without a chance of escape for her. She shivered slightly at the recollection, but steeled herself to sit up and listen for what was coming. She still looked as she had looked on the former occasion, very fair, pale, and young, in the black dress which she continued to wear ; she clasped her thin little hands in her lap, and asked her brother, plainly, \" Has anything happened to put you out, John ? \" \" Nothing out of the way, nothing which might not have been looked for,\" he said, with an incipient sneer at himself and her. \"The fact is, Constance, on our road to the station this afternoon, I asked Miss Hobbs to marry me, and she gave me the unqualified refusal which I richly deserved. If I had not lost my head I might have anticipated it, and saved us both \u2014 all of us, if the truth were known \u2014 from a deuced trying posi tion. But I don't suppose she will say a word, she is not the kind of woman who boasts of her conquests, and certainly she does not look on this one as being either an honour or a credit to anybody concerned.\" Constance had risen to her feet in the strength of her amazement and disgust. \" You proposed to Mattie Hobbs this afternoon, and she refused you, John ! \" she repeated, as if the statement were too incredible, and she could not believe her ears. Then \u2014 when he nodded in answer to her blank look up in his face, and added : \"Quite so. I am not likely to mistake the circumstance, am I ? \" with a slightly sardonic shrug of his shoulders \u2014 she exclaimed, vehemently : \"How cou'd she? how did she \" and then stopped, as if doubtful of his reception of her protest. \" Presume, do you mean ?\" he asked, quietly. \"There"], [337, "THE TRUTH 325 was no presumption in the matter \u2014 none on her side, that is. She was very angry for a moment, as you are. I daresay she regarded my offer as little short of a piece of blackguardism, the completion of a nefarious scheme which I had been so lott to manly and gentle manly feeling as to concoct deliberately. It could not have been pleasant for a woman, especially a high-spirited, high-minded woman such as she is, to have to put her foot down on such an offence.\" \" A piece of blackguardism, a nefarious scheme ! \" Constance echoed his words again, speaking shrilly in her excitement and resentment. \" I see no blackguard ism, and if there was any worldly, heartless scheme to take advantage of us, it must have been on the part of her and her family, not of you and me. I do not pretend that it is like them ; still, you can never tell what people will do, and I do not understand why you should reverse the position, and bring on yourself the accusation which, if it is cast on anybody, should be cast on them.\" \"That is just it, my poor Constance; you don't understand,\" said Sir John, dropping his sarcastic tone, and speaking almost with a groan, \" and it is for me to enlighten you. I have been greatly to blame, I am bound to acknowledge that, for not having under taken the disagreeable duty sooner, and it is part of my punishment, I suppose, to have to do it now7, for it is high time you understood. Sit down again, and let me talk to you,\" enjoined Sir John, with a determina tion which would not be overcome or set aside, and which appeared heedless of the fact that she was begin ning to tremble before him. \" You are no longer a mere girl, you are a married woman, a wife of several months' standing. Why you should have elected to be on the distant, defiant terms you have succeeded in establish ing between you and your husband and his family, you and the spirit of perversity can best tell. If I was cowardly and selfish in pushing you into the situation, I solemnly declare I have had nothing to do with your ehaviour since your marriage. I knew the Hobbses"], [338, "326 A MORNING MIST. were good people \u2014 I knew they would be kind to you ; I did not know, and could not be expected to guess, that a girl like you would set yourself up against the whole family \u2014 your husband's family, himself included. Who do you think you are ? What did you ask or hope for yourself, even before you took the marriage vows, which every good woman is considered to hold sacred ? \" \" John, you are very hard on me,\" said Constance, with quivering lips ; \" though you may have been disappointed to-day, though you may have been badly used even, is it right that you should turn upon me for it ? \" \" Good Heavens, Constance, I am not thinking of my self 1 \" exclaimed Sir John, who, like most men, ordinarily pacific and long-suffering, when he did make a stand and take a desperate resolution which ought to have been taken long before, was apt to lash himself into a blind fury. It is the attitude of the docile, patient horse who suddenly finds himself with the bit between his teeth, a five-barred gate, which he knows he must cross, right in his path, and is fain to take in a flying leap the object of his secret terror. When Sir John Beauchamp sought his sister's room that evening, he had said to himself, in the depth of de spondency, \" I would sooner be shot than tell her, yet her eyes must be opened, and I must do it, since none of these worthy people have appropriated the task. They have left it to me,\" and now he was storming because he was the sufferer, the injured person. \" Is it possible you can suppose mo capable of revenging on you any disap pointment I have had to bear? You must think me a mean dog to spend my grudge on you, even though the grudge had been justifiable. As it is, I don't imagine for a moment now that Miss Hobbs would have looked at or listened to me though you had been the most complacently loving of wives to her brother, and the most grateful and responsive of daughters and sisters to the woman who came to you in your need, and the other woman who was ready to be your friend from the first. I don't fancy at this moment that it would have signified in the slightest so far as the fortune of my idiotic"], [339, "THE TRUTH. 327 proposal was concerned, if such a girl as you had not been in existence ; your rampant pride aud vanity need not take upon them guilt of which I make no question they are innocent. You and your infernally stubborn temper are not to blame for my disappointment. Disap pointment ? I don't know that I am disappointed, rather I feel like a whipped cur. I am mortally ashamed, as I could not have dreamt in my worst moments I should feel both for myself and you.\" \" This is too much!\" cried Constance, sitting up in her chair, with all the blood of all tbe Beauchamps dyeing her white face scarlet, while her blue eyes sparkled like steel, as Sir Randal's had sparkled when he was forced to stand at bay. \" I married Joe Hobbs at your bidding, to free you from the burden which you showed me I must be to you ; neither he nor you had any right to expect that I should care for him at your word, or that I should feel at home with his family, and look upon them as fit associates for either you or me.\" \" Why not? \" demanded Sir John, sternly. \" If such rot is deserving of investigation, what were the Beau champs, pray ? The Hobbses have never done anything to blush for. They are a good, honest stock, who have risen in the w*orld, as they were entitled to do, and will continue to rise, let us hope, for the good of their country and the world at large. Mr. Hobbs refused a well-earned baronetcy, the other day. Pshaw ! What is a title to a man whose simple name is a force, a pledge of honour and power ? \" \" I do not underrate what Mr. Hobbs has done ; I like him better than any of them,\" said Constance, inno cently ; \" but I should trust the Beauchamps were not behind the Hobbses in their day, and that their knightly service to their king and country, though it was not so calculated to make money, did merit both respect and reward ; \" and Constance began to hold up her head again. \" My dear,\" said Sir John, cooling down and taking a seat opposite her, \" the less said of the Beauchamps the better ; I do not mean that they were all ruffians ; but,"], [340, "328 A MORNING MIST. in the first place, we don't know much about tbe older members of the race ; in the second, if we are to judge by their descendants \" \"I will not hear you say a word against them,\" said Constance, hotly, declining to see the hand which was held out to take hers. \" What ! slander your own people \u2014 among them my dear father, who was so unfortunate and yet was always so bright and kind 1 I can remember him quite well, and how much I missed him when he was no longer there to send for me and play with me. There was a cherry-tree in the garden at Fairfields that he said was my tree, and he used to shake down the cherries for me. He helped me to feed my rabbits and pigeons. He would even carry my big doll when it was too heavy for me. I have often heard Miss West say she never knew a more perfect gentleman. He could put everybody at their ease, and forget his own troubles in making those around him happy, he was so witty and entertaining ; and Miss West said that nobody could resist him long or continue to have any feeling of hostility in his company \u2014 though how anybody could feel hostile to him is a mystery to me. You are older than I, John ; you cannot have forgotten our father \u2014 such a father,\" she pressed him wistfully. \"No; I remember him perfectly,\" said Sir John, gravely; \"I was a lad holding my ensign commission the last time I saw him. It is all true that Miss West said.\" Constance was softened and soothed. '-' I have not so many bright recollections of mamma,\" she went on, confidentially, \" not only because I was younger when she died, but also because she was so much of an invalid for years. But I have often tried to get Miss West to speak about her, too ; and Miss West said she was very patient and humble with everybody, and very kind to the poor, though she had not the command of much money, naturally, when poor papa had been too generous, and had nearly spent the last of his inheritance. Miss West said, of her own accord, she was sure mamma was a religious woman in her last days. I never doubted it,\" ex plained Constance, with a mystified air; \"only Miss West"], [341, "THE TRUTH. 329 bade me remember that she, who was in a position to know, had told me so. Mamma was not your mother, and I have heard that your mother's family objected to papa's second marriage, because mamma was poor, and had no friends, and that there were family difficulties and quarrels \u2014 but your father was mine, and why should you say anything to shake my faith in him, and in the ancestors from whom we have both sprung?\" she pleaded, tearfully. \" It is all I have. I have always valued it as a possession which could not be taken from me.\" He was silent and motionless for a moment, then he caught the hand which she had refused to give him, aud held it tightly. \" No ; your mother was not mine, Connie,\" he said, gently. \"I only saw her once in my life, and that was by accident. But I have pitied her from the bottom of my heart ; never more so than when I came home from India, and learnt to know you \u2014 her daughter. I also heard some particulars of her history, with which I was previously unacquainted, from Tavi- stock, Sir Randal's old agent. But you do not accuse me of slandering her \u2014 you accuse me of slandering our father. Is it likely ? Is it credible ? I will tell you the truth as it was told to me to-day. It is a wonderful enlightener even to a stupid fellow like me. My father and yours was one of those men of whom people are accustomed to say that he was nobody's enemy but his own, and that he was his own worst enemy. That may be ; but he was also his children's enemy \u2014 no, you must hear me out, Constance,\" as she tried to start away from him. \" He was the enemy of the women who loved and trusted him, whom be was bound to cherish and protect. He did not mean it, I will grant that ; he had never known how to deny himself \u2014 no one had set him the example, or taught him the lesson, and he was such a man that when I spent a week with him, as a stripling, just come of age, I not only cheerfully signed away my share of Fairfields, I fully forgave him his wrongs against me and my mother which had been dinned into my ears by his most irreconcilable foes from"], [342, "330 A MORNING MIST. my earliest boyhood. That happened more than ten years ago ; but the glamour of the week I spent with him is over me still. So far as I am concerned, I not only freely forgive him at this moment, I would fain be spared the ungracious task of telling the little girl of whom he was so fond what manner of man he was.\" \" You need not say another word,\" cried Constance, passionately, \" for it will have no effect ; I will never believe a word against papa \u2014 never.\" \" Not in common justice to others, to your mother, among the rest ; to me \u2014 all you have left of kith and kin, to whom you took so kindly not more than six months ago ? It is not unfair to him. He did not mean to deceive you. He had many and grievous faults, but hypocrisy was not one of them. You will not believe me, Constance, though I tell you in sad earnest that he deserted my mother, soured and maddened her, and dragged yours through the mire, ruining her reputation and breaking her heart for very sorrow and shame before he made her his wife ? \" She sat staring at him with short, rapid breathing, wide-open eyes, and cheeks which looked pinched as well as pallid when all the blood had deserted them. She clenched her disengaged hand till the fine nails cut the skin. \" Why do you say such horrid, wicked things ? \" she asked, in a strained, forced voice, which, in its un familiar tones, had not an echo of her natural voice. \" What can you mean by it ? They are not true.\" ' ' They are sober truth, my poor girl, and you must hear me out. Your mother was a poor simple girl, belonging to the working class, from which the Hobbses have sprung. Indeed, old Hobbs was a friend of her family, though I did not hear the fact from him ; I heard it along with some other particulars from Tavistock, when I saw him last month. From what I was led to understand, Hobbs wished to marry your mother at one time.\" Constance started a little at that, amidst the wild confusion in her heart and brain. \" Whether she ever consented to marry him I cannot"], [343, "THE TRUTH. 331 tell. She was in some kind of upper service when Sir Randal came across her, just after his final quarrel with my mother. How was a girl like her to resist a man such as he was ? He made her what reparation was in his power by marrying her as soon as my poor mother died \u2014 the very day after the funeral, I believe. I was told that he was a kind husband to his second wife, though she never held up her head again ; and I know he was the most indulgent of fathers to you. It w7as not in him to be otherwise than cordial and caressing to young people. He was so, even to me, who had been brought up apart and estranged from him, and made a bone of contention between him and my mother's rela tions. You have referred to Sir Randal's sweet, buoy ant temper in adversity, his capacity for giving and receiving pleasure in the last extremity. Now, have you any idea who gave him the opportunity7, saved him from arrest, kept the roof over his head, which sheltered him in his dying hours, enabled him to spend them in peace, with you at his call, and some of the old friends and servants whom nothing he did could estrange, within his reach ? \" She gave her head a dismal, forlorn, little shake. \"It was Hobbs, here. Your father's circumstances and condition came to his knowledge, and he advanced money to appease the more urgent of the creditors, re questing that his name might not be brought forward. It was then that he mentioned to Tavistock as a reason for what he did that he had known your mother and her people when she was a girl. Tavistock, being a lawyer, ferreted out the rest.\" Sir John was mortally afraid that he had gone too far, his sister sat so still, as if struck to the heart ; she had ceased her clamour, she no longer accused him of wilful slander and falsehood. She was dumb and motionless, as though she had been turned to stone. \" I have done it, and put my foot into it, as usual,\" he told himself, disconsolately ; but he was forced to go on with his unpalatable tale ; he could not spare her one word of the information he felt bound to lay before her."], [344, "332 A MORNING MIST. \" Nobody told you the truth, Connie. Rightly or wrongly, it was always kept from you, lest it should shock and affront you \u2014 who were the innocent victim of the wrong-doing of others \u2014 but, of course, many people knew, among them, the Hobbs family, from the beginning, and I am certain not one of them ever gave the most distant hint of what must have silenced and subdued you at once. You came among them like a princess who had stooped to ally herself with her natural vassals, to whom it ought to have been an honour to serve her \u2014 and they \u2014 they were too noble to show you your error. You \u25a0never concealed from them that you scouted the con nection which you had all the time entered into for your eonvenience and mine. Notwithstanding this extreme provocation, not one \u2014 not your good, clever husband, as chivalrous as any Quixote ; not your pet aversion, his worthy, sharp-tongued mother ; not your first friend, Miss Hobbs, who, I must say, delivered her mind of her opinion of me this morning, without the smallest cere mony \u2014 turned upon you. No, Constance, you cannot say that any one of them has, even in self-defence, turned upon you.\" \" No ! No ! \" She suddenly relieved him by lookingup and exclaiming, stretching out her hand in piteous appeal as she did so, \" I do not complain of them ; I have never complained. It is all of you, who are silently, or with dreadful taunts, accusing me of folly and ingratitude. Go away, please, John, and send my husband to me ; you see I do not refuse to acknowledge him as my hus band; I have never refused since I consented to marry him ; I wish to speak to Joe.\" \" Certainly you shall, if you wish it, Connie,\" said Sir John, reassuringly. \"It is the most natural thing in the world to ask ; I can guess that, though I am not married like you and Joe.\" He put up his hand, with such a strong impulse to smooth her ruffled hair caressingly, as he had rarely felt when she was his humble servant and \u2022devout worshipper. But she moved her head away quickly, and continued to implore him : \"Will you go down, John, and send up Joe?\""], [345, "THE TRUTH. 333 \" I shall presently ; I am sure he will not be too engaged to obey the summons,\" Sir John answered her, with something of his old deliberation. ''\u25a0 But you are not angry with me, I hope ? You are not going to bring down his wrath upon me for causing you some vexation ? I have borne a good deal in my day; indeed, I have stood a considerable amount of wigging on my own account since I got out of bed this morning. I do not feel equal to taking ' the redder's lick ' in addition.\" It was a clumsy, not particularly well-timed joke, but he did not know what to say to turn off the edge of his recent atttack on her, for which he felt, now that it was over, guilty and abashed. As for Constance, she would not curve the lips she had been pressing together to keep back a tempest of sobs into the faintest apology for a smile ; she said, in breathless haste and deprecation, \" I am not angry with you \u2014 why should I be ? I shall never have the heart to be angry with you or any one else again. I want Joe.\" \"It is a pity that you have not wanted him before now,\" Sir John said to himself, as he left the room ; \" and I suppose it would serve you right, my poor Constance, if you were to want him in vain. But it is well you should turn to him, and seek your natural refuge, which will not be denied you. For he's too good a feilow, and cares far too much for a poor foolish little girl to bear malice.\""], [346, "CHAPTER XXVI. THE FRUITS. When Joe Hobbs received his wife's message without any explanation and hastened to obey it, he found Constance, to his dismay, pacing up and down the room like a creature in a state of distraction. She sought to cover her face, red and white by turns, now with her hands, now by hiding it on the cushions of her chair. \" What is it ? What can I do for you, darling ? \" he asked, in the utmost perplexity and trepidation. He almost hesitated to approach her, she had so contrived to impress upon him that he must keep his distance, because he had already taken a great and unwarrantable advantage of her in her first sorrow and strait. What was his surprise, well-nigh his consternation, when, at the sound of his voice, she ran to him and clung to him. \"Take me away with you, Joe,\" she cried ; \" I cannot bear to face anybody but you ! \" He had a horrible fear that she had lost her senses as he held her close to him, and assured her that she should do exactly as she pleased, she should not be asked to face anybody unless she liked to do so. She raised her head from his breast to look into his eyes. \" They have all been keeping things back from me,\" she said, in a tone of keen pain and mortification. \" They have every one been deceiving me, even my own Miss West, even you. But you have not done it from pity, you did it from love. You have not been treating me as a naughty child, to be humoured and scorned, when I could not be punished. Oh, I am so ashamed, so dreadfully ashamed. Let me go to America with you"], [347, "THE FRUITS. 335 where nobody will know. He said \u2014 John said many people knew7, perhaps the whole world is aware of what was never told to me, w7hom it principally concerned, though it would have made such a difference to me in what I thought and did. I might die in Canada where nobody knew me or was aware that I had given myself airs to which I was never entitled, or you might settle there among your emigrants. I would t'*y to help you, I would learn to be useful. You see, I would be sensible from the first that the poorest of them was better than I. My mother in her happier days, before she went wrong and w7as so sorry \u2014 poor miserable mother ! might have been like one of them, who had come of honester folks than I had.\" He had a glimmering of what had happened, and he saw that she was in a frenzy of grief and humiliation, and in her frenzy she was exaggerating and mistaking her relations with others ; she had only come to him under the impression that everybody else had failed her, and she was very unjust to everybody else. He admitted all that to himself, but notwithstanding the admission it was inexpressibly sweet and precious to feel his young wife's arms clasped round his neck and her head buried in his bosom, to hear her sobbing out, \" You will take me with you, Joe \u2014 won't you? You have always been kind, you care for me \u2014 just for me, myself. You will never look down upon me.\" \" No, no. What could put such an absurd idea into your head? Of course \u2014 of course, dearest, I will be too proud and happy to have your company if you care to go to America with me.\" The mere proposal on her part was a reward far be yond anything he would have claimed for his tender for bearance. Yet his heart smote him for joyfully clutching it, because of her abasement and anguish. \"Nobody could look down upon you,\" he protested. \" Ah, yes, I know,\" she cried, in accents of despairing conviction, \" Mattie and your mother, and the boys and girls, when they grow up and learn the truth. They will not reproach me because of the stain on my mother and"], [348, "336 A MORNING MIST. my father's sin, for they are good, oh ! yes, vt.ry good and wise, far better than a poor, deluded girl like me. They have never done so yet, and why should thsy begin after I have ceased to provoke them '?\u2014 after they see me humbled in the dust ? But they will not be able to help looking down on me for my past silliness and arrogance and false pretensions \u2014 God help me, I did not dream they were false ! \u2014 if for nothing else. I could see John \u2014 my brother, of whom I thought so much, was ready to despise me when he was, as he said, doing his duty and opening my eyes to the actual situation. I think I shall just die with shame unless you, Joe, dear Joe, who do care for me, myself, will come to my aid and deliver me from mocking eyes.\" He swore that none should mock her and he standing by. He vowed to do whatever she asked, and never to forsake her. Good Lord ! how should he, when it was his unlooked-for triumph and delight to have her, as she was doing now, claiming him as her first and best friend, in an unfaltering championship which was unnecessary, no doubt, but was intensely real to her? When the dinner company had left, and Joe was restored to the bosom of his family, he electrified them by making an announcement in the most matter-of-fact manner, while he frowned till his eyes were nearly lost in his head, with a mixture of exultant satisfaction and shamefacedness \u2014 the latter was on his own account. He was about to alter his arrangements. Constance was going with him. She wished it, and he had agreed to it. At the same time, he did not intend either to defer his departure or hasten his return. His wife was ready to start with him at a moment's notice, and he and she would probably be absent for fully the amount of time he had proposed. If his father saw no objection to the length of his stay, he should like, in addition to transacting the business of the firm and the emigration society, to avail himself of the opportunity of making Constance acquainted with the leading features of North America \u2014 the great rivers, lakes, and forests, the camping out in summer, the ice carnivals in"], [349, "THE FRUITS. 337 winter \u2014 all that would be most likely to interest a stranger. Joe's communication was received in what may be called striking silence ; only the rustling of Mattie's dress in the restless movements she made, as an excuse \"for the fluttering of her heart, broke the stillness. She was conscience-stricken, and Sir John was also conscience stricken; while he contrived to preserve an unruffled countenance. To all appearance the family acquiesced mutely in Joe's resolution. It was only when one mem her had done anything rather than sleep upon it, that a storm of opposition broke forth where Mattie was con cerned. The storm would have raged more fiercely and been more widely spread, if anybody apart from the young couple themselves had been aware of the pre posterously great sacrifice which Constance had had the audacity to ask from Joe, when she had suggested that he might, for her sake, forfeit his birthright and become a naturalised Canadian. As it was, old Joe was apt to generalise and hold primitive views of what was right and fitting. He had not condescended to be disturbed in his serenity by any cloud on the domestic horizon. He had already agreed to Joe's managing the boiler making contracts across the Atlantic for the next season, and he did not see it made any difference, on the contrary, he was glad that the lady wife was shaking herself up \u2014 a spiritless thing compared to what her mother had been in her best days, but not without a heart, since she had been in the dumps so long for her old governess's death. It was a very proper proposal, though made rather late in the day, that Mrs. Joe should accompany her husband. It would do the young woman good, she would see the world, and she w7ould be company for Joe. Mrs. Hobbs ostentatiously washed her hands of the matter \u2014 she did not wish to make or meddle, it was other people's business. Then Mattie assailed her mother in private. \" It must not be, mother,\" she declared, in her perturbation. \" Constance is not fit for such a journey, i n such circumstances it is enough to kill her. There 22"], [350, "338 A MORNING MIST. is every chance of a rough passage at this time of the year, and Joe has taken his berth in an emigrant ship. The loss of the passage-money would be nothing, but I do not see how he can draw back when he is the secretary of the society. She will not consent to wait behind and let me go out with her in spring \u2014 I should not mind, and you and father would not object \u2014 in a suitable vessel, after she has got a suitable out fit. I have spoken both to her and Joe, but they are quite impracticable. I never saw Joe so infatuated, so bent on not listening to reason.\" \" So most maiden sisters think when their interests and the interests of the young missus clash,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, sardonically. \"But it must not be allowed, mother,\" urged Mattie ; \"it is unheard-of rashness. She has never travelled, or been exposed to fatigue or discomfort.\" \" It is high time, then, as she had to do more than sit back in a carriage or- an easy-chair, and count her fingers,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, briefly. \"But if she should break down or die, what could we think ? What would Joe do ? He would never cease to reproach himself, he would never hold up his head again, because he had abetted this mad project.\" \"Nothing of the kind,\" Mrs. Hobbs was at last roused into declaring dogmatically, not in reference to her son, but to her daughter-in-law. \"Why, even a fine ladylike Lady Theresa, who has already gone round the world in a caprice, for a frolic, is better qualified to encounter difficulty than poor Con. stance is,\" maintained Mattie. \"It is the most purpose-like thing as ever I heard of her doing. I ain't without hope of her from this mo ment,\" asserted Mrs. Hobbs, magnanimously. \"Where ought a woman to be, Martha Hobbs, but with her master, if so be she have one ; and if it is good enough for he, it never oughter be too bad for her. I ain't a scho lard, and if a scholard goes for to teach the reverse, then the Apostle Paul w*as right when he said that that man and woman was worser than an infidel. Kill her ! \u2014 not"], [351, "THE FRUITS. 339 it ; she has more stuff in her straight back, slim neck, and light foot than that there comes to. Her'll come to her senses, that is what will happen, and high time, says I. Her'll learn what our Joe is worth, after them two is alone in the wilderness in furrin' parts.\" When Mattie found that there was no help to be looked for from her mother, she was driven to appeal to Sir John. There was a stone verandah before the drawing-room windows on the w7est side of the house. It commanded a fine view of the landscape. The family, when they could spare time, and their visitors, who were usually more disengaged, had a habit of slipping out on the verandah, when the weather was fine, to watch the dying day. Mattie had often mentally accused Sir John of loafing there for ages, so that she knew where to find him on the day in question. She was still in the hat and jacket in which she had driven to the station to meet her father. Joe had not been in town, and he and his wife, after having stood so long at arm's length, had suddenly struck up an alliance offensive and defensive, which set Mattie at defiance. She had wasted her eloquence on her father, who would persist in seeing life on grand primitive lines. \" My dear, I don't know what you're making such a fuss about. It's nothing to goto America nowadays. I have been out \u2014 let me see ? four times. Au emigrant ship is decently comfortable, and what doss one want more? Luxuries and ceremonies are a still greater bore at sea than on shore. I'm afraid you're getting a bit of a fine lady. Why, there's your mother would have gone with me in a canoe or a cock-boat to the ends of the earth, if you children had not stood in the way, and I had but said the word. I'm afraid, my lass, there ain't any of you, unless that boy Joe when his blood is up, as game as your mother.\" \" Will you not interfere, Sir John ? \" She went straight to the point, dead in earnest, walking up to Sir John on the verandah, and yet not so absolutely free from self-consciousness as she would have liked. Her"], [352, "340 A MORNING MIST. beautiful frank face was not only clouded with trouble, it was crimson with contrition. \" I am afraid it was all my fault. I must have appeared to you very ungrateful and rude at Oxford ; I had no right to say what I did. It was not my place to judge and dictate. You spoke to your sister, did you not '? \" \" I spoke to my sister,\" acquiesced Sir John, gravely. \" I ought to have done it before now.\" \"No, no!\" cried Mattie, in her passionate regret. \"It would all have come right in time, there was no call for me to meddle. I beg her pardon and yours.\" \" Do not say another word,\" he interrupted her, \"and do not be sorry if one of us has at last shown the capa bility to do a true and brave thing. I am heartily glad, for your brother's sake and hers, and yours \u2014 for all of you, in fact, that it is Constance who has taken the initia tive and seized the bull by the horns. \" \" Surely you will not punish me so severely as you will do, by letting her start with Joe?\" she pressed him. \" It will be enough for her to follow him in the late spring or early summer. Think of the voyage for her at this season of the year. Imagine the discomforts and inconveniences of an ordinary emigrant ship for one reared as she has been.\" \" I think you are creating bugbears aud frightening yourself with them, if you will submit to be accused o anything so fanciful,\" he told her, with a mild spurt of superiority which was perfectly pardonable. Then he went on, arriving at Mrs. Hobbs's conclusion, after employing her arguments, without being aware of it \u2014 two such different people as it sounded to pronounce the same verdict ! \" Connie is not the delicate fine lady you are repre senting her. She may be untravelled and inexperienced, but she has been till lately a healthy country-bred English girl. She will show that when she is tried, I do not doubt ; and supposing she broke down, she i3 with her husband, as she ought to be.\" \" You are all alike,\" said Mattie, impetuously, as she turned from him. \" You leave her alone ; you thrust"], [353, "THE FRUITS. 341 her on circumstances for which she has had no prepara tion, and you condemn her to pay the penalty. Poor Constance, that has been her fate throughout, you will not interfere.\" \" I decline to interfere further,\" said Sir John, with a determination which might have convinced Mattie Hobbs, if she had ever questioned the fact, that, however supine Sir John might be, he was not weak as water in the face of persuasion and temptation, like his brilliant father. Sir John might be as lazy and finicking as he looked, but when he had made up his mind, he was no more likely to change it than she, Mattie Hobbs, was to change hers. He had the grace to be sorry for her discomfiture and pain, hardly as she had dealt with him the day before. \"Don't bother, Miss Hobbs,\" he said, with the slow, good-natured smile, and the heavy lids drooping over his eyes, which had been his dominant characteristics when he appeared a conquering hero to Constance ; \"the mis chief is not of your making, and it may not turn out such mighty mischief after all. I should feel for you, because, as one of the authors of the original wrongdoing, I had much more reason to lay it to heart till I saw 3igns of its being remedied. You only brought light to bear on the evil. Truth can do no lasting harm, can it ? Truth is a great rouser and revealer when it does let in the light. I cannot flatter myself that you take a profound interest in my affairs, but I have faith in your general friendli ness and benevolence. You wish all the world well, and would spend your strength in redressing wrongs, so why should you not be pleased at doing a good deed and conferring a benefit on a poor fellow such as I am, who am yet a connection of yours, through your brother and his wife. I am going back to India with the full inten tion of squaring my accounts, setting my small house in order, and selling out. I am going to try breaking stones at the side of the road, or something like it, as you recommended,\" explained Sir John, with his wonted deliberation. \"I am going to have done with shams and subterfuges, and with spending my life on economies so"], [354, "A MORNING MIST. 342 that I may pretend to be a man in affluent circumstances, living with men of affluence, ' gentlemen, and officers,' in the current phrase.\" \" Don't turn my own words against me,\" she implored him. \" Don't do anything reckless and lay it to my charge, I beg and entreat you. I am miserable enough already with thinking that I have precipitated matters. My temper, my anger against Constance for casting away the privilege of making Joe happy, my jealousy, perhaps, for one cannot tell how low and small one's motives may get \" \"Hush!\" He checked her gently. \"You know I cannot stand here and listen to you slandering yourself. It is the next thing to listening to some one else slander- ing you and holding my tongue. You were never jealous of any one, Constance or another. There are men who think all women are jealous, the best women the most jealous ; but I know better. Besides, you have neither the time nor the cause to be jealous. The sun is not jealous of the moon. Poor Connie, I wonder if she seems as young and simple to you as she seems to me? \" \" Sir John Beauchamp ! \" exclaimed Mattie, in sheer desperation, \" if you begin to flatter me after what has passed, I think I shall never, of my own free will, speak to you again. You will undo all you have done \u2014 I mean with regard to the respect I was beginning to entertain for you. I have not thought very badly of you, but now, if you do not take care. I shall hate you outright.\" \" Then I will not bring about such a consummation if I can prevent it,\" said Sir John, with a return to his natural sang froid. \"But, please, be so good as to re- member, Miss Hobbs, that if men or women succeed in setting a stone rolling they must be content with their success and take the consequences. It is not always in their power to stop the stone when they like.\" So Mr. and Mrs. Joe departed at the time he had appointed. He looked hopeful, and even happy, in his excitement ; and she was not paler or more downcast than when she had arrived as a bride at Kingsmeadows. There was a pathetic concession in her manner when, in-"], [355, "THE FRUITS. 343 stead of shrinking from the embraces of her husband's family, she held up her face for every one's kiss, not to meet disconsolate Bessie's clinging little lips aloue, but for the small, sharp dab which stood with Mrs. Hobbs fora salute. It was as if Constance had said: \"I am not worthy in any sense, I know and understand now. I have not deserved the trouble you have taken, and the patience you have had with me ; I have repaid them badly. But I am going far away. The chances of life are many, and I may never come back. You are always seeking how to be good and kind to the less worthy and wise and fortunate of your fellow-creatures. It is your business ; you have chosen it as your calling. In your goodness and kindness, will you forgive and forget that I have trespassed against you and tried you ? \""], [356, "CHAPTER XXVII. THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. It was nearly two years before young Joe Hobbs wound up his engagements in Canada and the States, and returned with his wife to England. In the meantime, life had gone on at Kingsmeadows much as before. Old Joe could not be more occupied, in his quiet, inexhaustible fashion, with his great works and trade enterprizes, and with his craving for perfection in everything he undertook, down to the planting and fencing, the pine-producing and orchid-raising at Kings meadows, than he had been before. Mrs. Hobbs could not be busier or Mattie more cease lessly engaged. Indeed, there seemed a heavier obligation than ever laid on Mattie that she should have no end of work, and no diminution in her innumerable clients of all classes and conditions. She was still too full of magnificent health and life to give way, to grow worn or haggard under her burden; only when she fell back wearied out, or raised her tired, aching arms above her head, she no longer cried that work was good, that it was better to wear out than to rust out \u2014 she said that she must work or she must die. She must atone as far as she could in that way for all the errors she had committed, the risks she had caused people to run, the extremities to which she had reduced them. The younger boys and girls were growing bigger, but they were in the transition stage which had carried off Ben and Sam to a public school, and transferred Hannah \u2014 with Alice Parry still bearing her company \u2014 entirely to the schoolroom, leaving only Bessie still hovering"], [357, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 345 between that and the vacated nursery. Mrs. Hobbs was forced to anticipate the time when both would be empty and shut, when the work in life which had been dearest to her, which had cost her the sharpest pangs and brought her the keenest joys, would have passed away from her. Sir John Beauchamp had not left the army, as he had threatened, for the very good, if startling, reason that the army could not do without him. When he re turned to India he found his regiment engaged in active service. It was not the contest on a grand scale, with the welfare of nations dependent upon it, and every gain and loss of signal importance to the civilised world, which marks a great European war. It was the harassing, unequal struggle, often more humiliating than glorious, in which, all the same, brave men, in the flower of their youth, or the meridian of their days and their powers, were called upon to throw away their lives in what was no better than a succession of obscure gue rilla skirmishes with native tribes of fierce yet dastardly foes, or of fawming yet treacherous allies. These were circumstances in which it was impossible for Sir John, or any other honourable man, to sell out, and, as it proved, it was well he did not do so. For the first time since he entered the Army as a stripling an opportunity occurred in his hitherto barren career of doing his duty otherwise than by being reasonably humane and considerate to his men, exact in his share of drill, parade, changing quarters, &c, and exemplary in living within his narrow income and being generally harmless and well-disposed. A chance presented itself of accomplishing something manlier, more spirited, less passive in its heroism. He was appointed to a small separate command, which by an accident of war became a post of responsibility and mark. The fortunes of the miniature campaign turned for ten days on Sir John's isolated fort, round which dark-skinned, lithe-limbed enemies swarmed and hurled themselves like so many demons. If a remarkable transformation had not been effected then and there on the commandant of the fort,,"], [358, "346 A MORNING MIST. according to the previous estimate of him, it would have fared badly with a section of Her Majesty's Army and a north-west province of her Indian empire. But, to the astounded admiration of his old acquaintances aud com rades, Sir John must have slept in his boots for these momentous ten days, if he w*ere not reduced to eating the boots, like Blake at Taunton. At the very moment when the realisation that \" Old Beauchamp,\" the hand some blinking owl of an out-at-elbows baronet, the dawdling amateur artist and naturalist, had got the command of the fort in question, was bringing men's hearts into their mouths, \" Old Beauchamp \" rose to the occasion, stuck his glass into his eye, blinked no more, dawdled and played the dillettante no more. He dis played so much vigilance, sagacity, and gallant devotion that he carried the day, and was crowned with late, undreamt-of laurels. He had favourable mention in each of the two or three despatches which chronicled the leading episode of the war. Warm-hearted men, in the reaction of their sudden enthusiasm, protested that he ought to be promoted step after step with as little delay as possible, and prophesied that he would die a brigadier, if he were not buried in Westminster Abbey. But the tide of Sir John's fortunes ebbed as quickly as it had flowed; his health, impaired by the number of years he had spent in India, gave way again, and he had to return to England before he had been gazetted to higher rank than that of a major. Newspapers, both English and Anglo-Indian, had con veyed to Kingsmeadows the tidings of Sir John's unexpected exploits, and old Joe Hobbs no sooner learned that his rival's son, and young Joe's brother-in-law, was ordered once more to England on sick leave, than he wrote the friendliest of old-fashioned formal letters, begging Sir John to make Kingsmeadows his head quarters. \"Poor chap ! \" said Mrs. Hobbs, in an aggressive tone, \"he's the best of the lot. I always knowed it were in him to behave like a man\u2014 only he were that sat upon, pared down, and done into a nonentity. If he had not"], [359, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 347 been a good chap he would have gone to the dogs, like his precious father, afore he was out of his twenties ; and now that he have licked the blackies, it weren't worth the doing, considering all the reward he's like to get for his pains. Not a hole of his own to come to. That doll of a sister making a roving blade of our Joe. No missus to bid Sir John sit clown where he has the best right to pull in his chair, and not so much praise him \u2014 when he's in everybody's mouth already \u2014 lest he should be uplifted with pride, as scold him for biding so long away.\" Mattie was tempted to think that there was some thing personal in her mother's remarks, though how could that be '? and w7hat had she to do with this newly fledged hero, from a stock which had been reckoned exhausted ? Mattie had breathed not a word, as Sir John had predicted, of the offer of marriage he had made to her on their way to the Oxford railway station \u2014 the offer which she had treated with a contumely which had rebounded on her own head. But Mrs. Hobbs's acute ness had penetrated the secret from the first. It did not seem as if Kingsmeadows were, after all, a bad substitute for the house or hole of which Sir John was devoid, where he was free to hang up his sword, metaphorically7, for as long a time as he liked on its walls. With his sang froid and the touch of womanly adaptability which balanced his slowness and stiffness, he was content for the present to make himself at home, in his unobtrusive fashion, and to fall into his place in the Hobbs's family circle as naturally as if it had belonged to him. He was the old Sir John still ; he had relapsed into a good deal of his former apathy. He was not much more self-assertive and hopeful than before. Yet an observer, watching him narrowly, might have detected that in the middle of his languor he raised his head with a certain modest satisfaction because be had been enabled to show, though in all probability by a solitary example, what there had been in him all along. Among Sir John's not very extensive traps, there"], [360, "348 A MORNING MIST. appeared convincing evidence that constancy was one of his attributes. He had remembered his friends, in not a very original or magnificent manner, perhaps, but to the best of his ability. There were the magical balls, the work-boxes, the chop-sticks, the hideous dolls for the children ; the indispensable set of chessmen for Mr. Hobbs \u2014 who, though he had solved many a problem in trade, and even some riddles in political economy, had never played a game at chess, and had even to be taught, at bis time of life, the names of the men and the initiatory moves. To the ladies of the family the wanderer brought back the soft lama shawls, which, except in the case of royalty, have replaced the gorgeous cashmeres, and are more within the capabilities of a slender purse. \"I was bringing one for Constance, and I thought that you,\" with a glance which included both Mrs. Hobbs and Miss Hobbs, \" would do me the favour to accept of the others,\" said Sir John, with such admir able impassiveness that Mattie felt far behind her despised suitor in desirable nonchalance, if not in lofty magnanimity. \"If there's any favours going its on our side, Sir John,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with prompt graciousness, as she pro ceeded to dispose the graceful folds of the shawl round her square, angular shoulders. But she was not con tent with the delivery of the polite acknowledgment. \" There's some on us,\" she went on, with astonishing frankness, \" as can't expect to have much comfort in the fine wrap. There's them as must feel it weigh like lead on their back, for all so light as it is. But that is none of your fault,\" and she nodded reassuringly to her friend. \" It don't take from your uncommon handsome ness in making the gift to one and all ; so that you needn't trouble about that.\" The result was that there were two flaming faces in stead of one, and two people \u2014 the innocent, as well as the guilty \u2014 covered with confusion. It looked as if Mrs. Hobbs took what she chose to regard as Sir John's wrongs so much to heart that she was thrown into an illness. She was suddenly attacked"], [361, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 349 by a dangerous, well-nigh a desperate, malady, and all was alarm and distress in the great house. The sick woman\u2014 whatever her disqualifications and defects \u2014 had been its presiding genius and guiding spirit. It was significant and impressive to see how the arresting of the activity of one beneficent, if rasping nature, brought so much of the machinery of fife to a standstill, while anxiety, disconsolateness, and consternation pre vailed on every hand. The school-room, the house keeper's-room, the dairy, and poultry-yard, the very parish, so far as Mattie's district was concerned, were paralysed. The public rooms at Kingsmeadows were untenanted, save for the meals, eaten as well as might be, for heaviness of heart, in haste and trepidation so long as the mistress of all lay in a death-like sleep, or babbled in delirium of the poor chap who had been defrauded of his rights, who had come home with no home to come to. Mr. Hobbs did not fail his clients\u2014 the holders of his contracts or his servants who worked the contracts out \u2014 in this tribulation, any more than he had failed his masters in the old days at Willesden, when he had gone to his work and executed his task while his little ones lay sick unto death in the house he had left. He had often feared to return home, with a cold, sick fear which only a brave, manly courage and faith could face and overcome. The same fear was on him again in his office and foundry, where so many depended upon him, to which he would go as long as he could ; and while he transacted his business nobody could have detected much amiss with the large-headed, far-sighted man of business. It was when he came down to Kingsmeadows that he was lost. He wandered out and in and up and down, waylaying and crossquestioning the doctors and nurses ; he stole many times in the day and night to the door of Mrs. Hobbs's room \u2014 be did not know how often, even in her unconsciousness she showed signs of recognising his step. He listened wistfully to every sound within, when he would not disturb the patient or her nurses, by taking any other means of getting the last news of her"], [362, "350 A MORNING MIST. condition. He hung with a pathetic dependence, which was a reversal of their natural relations, on every look and word of Mattie's, because she had experience aud skill only second to those of the doctors, and she was day and night with her mother, striving hand to hand with the enemy to pull her through the conflict, fighting the grim battle betwixt life and death. Mr. Hobbs, who was mannerly in his way, thought it necessary to apologise to Sir John for the disorder of mind in which the master of the house found himself compelled to neglect his guest. \" It ain't my habit to be put out,\" he said, falling back in his excitement on the pithy, un couth phraseology which Mrs. Hobbs had never abandoned. ' ' I've seen a mort of troubles and bore them, too, as a Christian man ought, I trust. But it is the wife, Sir John, my Hannah, as never failed me before, and it is like pulling down the roof-tree, and putting out the hearth fire for the likes of she to be touched.\" Little Mrs. Parry rushed down from the Rectory, weeping and trembling, to ask if she might not come up with Mr. Parry to nurse dear, kind Mrs. Hobbs. Mrs. Chetwynd, from Chetwynd Lodge, nay, Lady Theresa Langton, to do her justice, had driven to Kingsmeadows with the same impossible request. Mattie was very grateful, while she explained that she and the pro fessional nurse with Miss Gerard and the elder servants to relieve them, could do all there was to do for the sick woman. But really the most available help which Mattie got was from Sir John Beauchamp, of all persons. He was \" coming out \" or \" getting on,\" by whatever phrase one chose to express his emerging from a cloud of social lethargy. Mrs. Hobbs herself had been under the im pression, and had aired her views without hesitation, when Miss West died, that, though Sir John might have fought battles and killed tigers, he was, without doubt, as incapable as most men in dealing with ordinary domestic affliction and bereavement. She had certainly found him overwhelmed by the double obligation of conducting poor Miss West's obsequies, and looking"], [363, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 351 after a young girl prostrate with sorrow. But he was not nearly so unhandy and impractical as the lady had imagined, not half so much so as his sister had been. Among the resources on which he had fallen back for spending the large amount of spare time which he had possessed for a dozen years in India, he had not mentioned to the uninitiated his voluntary services to ailing comrades, even to the sick children of his friends. His suggestions were worth listening to, and he was always ready to carry them out when Mattie and the doctors set their seals of approval on them. His contrivances for making and keeping ice were more ingenious, aud less liable to fail, than those of any one else. He improvised a punkah, which cooled the sick room without rendering it draughty and chilly. He rode faster than any groom, without causing his horse to cast her shoes, or come down on her knees, or turn over on her side in mid-career, to the surgery at Dor rington or to the station to fetch remedies and appli ances to meet unexpected complications. He saved poor old Joe Hobbs, who was far from having the pen of a ready writer, in any letters, save business letters, an immensity of toil and worry in answering inquiries and in keeping Joe and his wife, and the tw*o boys at school, in their enforced absence, informed daily of their mother's condition. If it came to that, Sir John was pre pared to start at any moment to break the nature of his errand to the two schoolboys, and fetch them home to receive their mother's final farewell, or to take their last look of her, supposing that was all which was granted to them. Mattie Hobbs had no scruple in accepting and making use of Sir John's kindness, in consideration of the extra ordinary regard which Mrs. Hobbs had conceived for him. \" Mother would rather be served by him than by any other person out of the family, if she knew,\" Mattie told herself, with the dry eyes which she dared not suffer to grow dim ; \"so that I need not refuse him the boon which he is so good as to seek.\" At last the foe was driven back, the point which was to"], [364, "352 A MORNING MIST. decide the fortunes of the day was attained, and the doctors and nurses triumphantly announced a new lease of life to Mrs. Hobbs, not without the proviso that she must submit to a more or less lengthened period of invalidism before she could hope to regain her former strength. When everybody was exchanging congratulations, Mattie, in her happiness, told Sir John, \" I believe we owe mother's recovery under God as much to you as to any one. I do not know what we should have done without you.\" Then she asked herself in dismay whether her speech had been either wise or womanly? But she could not grudge the amende honorable when she saw how his bronzed face lit up with pleasure. Surely she owed as much as that to her mother's friend, a family connection, one who, after the anxiety he had shared with them, could not again be like a stranger, a mere temporary acquaint ance, Constance's brother, and no more. Mrs. Hobbs was still not able for much more thau to sit up in her invalid chair, though all save herself were well satisfied at the slow, but sure, rate at which her recovery was progressing, when Joe and Mrs. Joe re appeared on the scene, without giving their relations a surprise. For they were aware that the couple had started on their homeward journey with the utmost speed they could attempt, when encumbered by a baby and nurse, on the first receipt of the intelligence of Mrs. Hobbs's illness. But could the bright, beautiful girl, full of confidence in her welcome, full of animation in the prospect of re counting her adventures, full of proud eagerness to display her treasure and Joe's, be the broken-hearted young woman, seeing everything through a jaundiced, distorted medium, who had left Kingsmeadows two years ago? Everybody had difficulty in believing it, with the exception of Mr. Hobbs. He only thought and said tranquilly, travelling and the sight of new countries had agreed with Mrs. Joe, had given her a colour and loosened her tongue ; she was more like what her mother had been when she was young."], [365, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 353 And could the smiling young fellow, so pleased with his hostages to fortune, himself no longer quite a whip ping-post, sitting in the same attitude for three minutes at a time, while his mother's feeble voice challenged him to the old rough banter, be Joe of the sad face, Joe the unresting, the baffled, the despairing ? \" Why, father, mother, he is actually growing fat! \" cried Mattie in exultation. \"Constance has got him to take things quietly as we never could ; or it may be the adorable baby ! But he is not old enough for that ; he is too red-faced and crumpled, much as hia admiring relatives think of him, for such a feat.\" But few of those present were inclined to limit the powers of the baby, the father and mother's offering to the grandparents, who had only that day set eyes on the third generation of their house, the coming man who was to carry on its traditions and glories, the living plaything for the possession of which its uncles and aunts would dispute. \" I am so glad that Constance is making Joe happy,\" cried Mattie, with a great sigh, when she was left alone with her mother. \"I am so much obliged to her.\" \" I'd like to know who is the most obligated person,\" snorted Mrs. Hobbs. Then Constance herself knocked at the door.and asked if she might come in. \" I thought you would like to hear more of our travels, and of the good time we had, if you are able to listen,\" said the intruder, with a pretty air of deferential entreaty, altogether new to Mrs. Hobbs. \" I thought you and Mattie would not mind having me, since Joe has rushed off to see after some of his institutes and his technical schools. I said,\" earnestly appealing to her listeners, \"did he think they ought to torment him the moment he had come off a journey ? But he told me he did not mind it, and that they were expecting him. I know these technical schools are of the greatest im portance,\" continued Constance, seriously. \" He has explained all about them to me, and how they may help the working-people of the future, and inspire them with the pride and pleasure in their work which some of the 23"], [366, "354 A MORNING MIST. workmen of the Middle Ages are supposed to have had \u2014 must have had, Joe says, or they could not have done their perfect work. He says his father has had it in making boilers, and in organising a great trade industry. Oh ! I know a good deal about it now ; I am not quite the foolish goose and supercilious ignoramus I used to be. But what I wish to say is this, that if he coached us and backed us, could we not relieve him and the inspector of some of their lighter duties ? Mattie, there, could, I believe, but she has so much to do already. If I could only help Mattie, I do not care to be idle any longer \u2014 I have learned to hate it ; if you would help me to help, I should be so proud, and I know Joe would be so pleased. But there, I'm tiring you,\" with a remorseful look at Mrs. Hobbs. \" No, you ain't,\" answered the invalid ; \" speak on, since you've found your tongue.\" \" Well, I want to say,\" hesitated Constance, in mani fest tremor, \" will you let me sit with you and nurse you sometimes? I \u2014 I \u2014 know I don't deserve it, and I am afraid you think me very useless and tiresome, with reason But I did nurse Miss West when she had lum bago, aud I nursed Joe when he had a bad cold and a feverish attack up at Winnipeg. We did not mention it in our letters, in case it might alarm you ; but he said I took good care of him and brought him round quickly.\" \" You see he were your master, I ain't your master,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, drily. \" No, but you are his mother and mine,\" said Con stance, with a sudden inspiration, venturing to stroke the thin, wrinkled hand with her soft young fingers. \" I ain't a polite woman ; I'd scold you for every mis take you made till I were black in the face,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with a somewhat ghastly grin. \" You did not scold me \u2014 that is, not much, and only for my good \u2014 when you came over, in your kindness of heart, to help a poor, scared, forlorn girl at Maisonette. I never really thanked you, which was horrid of me,\" confessed Constance, with penitent courage. \" I am older and wiser since Joe took me in hand, especially"], [367, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 355 since I have had my baby to care for. I don't think I should mind much, though you scolded me ; I mean I should rather like it if you would scold me as you scold Mattie and Joe.\" Indeed, Constance thought to herself that no amount of scolding from the formidable, excellent mistress of Kingsmeadows could be half so hard to bear as being spoken at for ten minutes at a time, and held up to family ridicule and reprobation, as Mrs. Joe had been held up in past times. \u25a0 \"We'll see,\" said the autocrat, with a few faint symptoms of being mollified, Presently she addressed her daughter-in-law by an abbreviation of her name which had never before been used. \" Come then, Con, let us see this boy of Joe's and yours again.\" Constance had the good sense and the good feeling to beam alike at the familiarity and at the nature of the request. \" I'll fetch him at once to his granny if Bessie will let me have him. She has not quitted his presence chamber \u2014 the old nursery \u2014 since he was deposited there.\" \" You see that he have his morning's sleep regular ? \" said Mrs. Hobbs, oracularly. \" I try,\" answered Constance, with the mingled wistfulness and diffidence with which one listens to an oracle. \" But neither nurse nor I can put him over sometimes, he is such a lively child. When Joe is at hand he can send baby to sleep better than anybody.\" \" Joe send anybody to sleep ! That do be a good one,\" remarked Mrs. Hobbs. \" Many a sleepless night he have cost me, and he not cutting a tooth nor nothing.\" \" I'll not be afraid of baby's cutting his teeth or having any child's ailment now,\" explained Constance, in atone of great confidence and comfort, \" when you are near to apply to. I know so little about babies. Nurse has had ex perience, is a worthy woman, and is fond of her charge, I am sure ; but the idea of trusting our baby to a nurse ! \" \" That's right,\" Mrs. Hobbs condescended to approve ; \" and you'll live and learn. You're entitled to all as I can tell you ; but he's in better and wiser hands than his mother's or his granny's, when all is done. Well for"], [368, "356 A MORNING MIST. him, poor little man,\" ended the old woman in a softened! voice, with a recollection of those little graves at Willesden. \"Did you ever see anybody so much improved?\" Mattie was driven to challenge her mother when Con stance left the room to bring the baby. \" Improved ! she ain't the same creature,\" admitted Mrs. Hobbs, candidly. \" But I don't go much with changes. Will it last ? \" \"I think it will \u2014 I am sure it will! There was always a great deal of good in Constance, even in her obstinate mourning for Miss West and clinging to the past. She was prejudiced, but she was never heartless.\" Constance laid the infant in the feeble arms and felt very thankful that her son winked, gaped, and clutched with his small fingers, but did not raise a wailing lamen tation. \" He do favour his father when he was that age,\" pronounced Mrs. Hobbs, after a solemn contemplation of the baby. \"There, doesn't he?\" chimed in Constance, in a flutter of delight. \"I always said so. Of course, I did not see Joe when he was so young ; I only judge from how he looks now. You, who must have studied his every feature and shade of expression when he was & child, have corroborated my opinion. Joe need not say after this that baby is like me. I can even fancy,\" pausing, as if fearing to take too great a liberty, \"that he has a look of Mr. Hobbs, just before he \u2014 baby, not Mr. Hobbs \u2014 falls asleep, when he appears very solemn, as babies often do.\" \"That may be,\" granted Mrs. Hobbs, with unusual harmoniousness, \" for young Joe favoured his father uncommon, so the third Joe may be a chip of the owd block.\" \" When he wakes up and is all alive in a moment, there never was such an active baby. The doctor in the steamer said the amount of vitality he had for his age was something remarkable. I have always fancied he resembled you,\" ended the young mother, waxing bolder"], [369, "THE TWO MRS. HOBBSES. 357 and holder, and feeling that so great a compliment could not but be acceptable. \" Go away with you ! \" said Mrs. Hobbs. \" I can guess his father is as great a fool about the babby as his mother is from his likening he to she. But sure enough him'll have your complexion, and I ain't certain \" \u2014 in a pleased tone \u2014 \" that he don't have a look of his Uncle John. Them red gold bits of fluff on his poll ain't on the Hobbses' side of the house.\" Constance was more than willing that any return compliment which was in the air should be transferred to her brother ; in awakening to the new allegiance she had gone back to the old \"Ah! yes, dear John,\" she said, affectionately; \"I should like baby to have a look of him, too. How he has distinguished himself in that last Indian war ! How proud Miss West would have been ! She always thought so much of martial glory \u2014 though I don't know that she expected it for John, much as she liked and admired him. I have some times imagined myself reading over and over again to her, in the drawing-room at Maisonette, the paragraphs in the newspapers in which his name was mentioned ; how he had repulsed this attack, and how he had contrived to throw up that earth mound. How proud we two should have been ! Yet how we should have trembled for the arrival of the next mail \u2014 we two poor, lonely women, with no man to argue down our fears as Joe argued down mine.\" \" Sir John is a capital ally in peace as well as in war,\" Mattie forced herself to say, with artificial sprightliness. \" We found it so when mother was ill.\" \" I knew you would,\" said Constance, triumphantly. \"Isn't he thoughtful and mindful when he looks as if he were doing nothing and thinking nothing? He posted us up with intelligence to allay our fears and keep up our hopes, at every stage, before we sailed and on our arrival in England. Joe called John 'a regular brick.'

Theee was one thing which was clear, that the two Mrs.. Hobbses would never lack a common subject of interest while the looks and requirements of the last-born Hobbs claimed their attention. There would still be occasion for Mrs. Hobbs senior to exercise her maternal experience each time the nurseries at Kingsmeadows were tenanted afresh. For a suitable house in the neighbourhood had at last been found for Joe and Mrs. Joe with their belong ings, and they were about to enter upon it with all the interest and eclat with which their previous search for a separate nest had not been attended. \" Martha Hobbs,\" Mrs. Hobbs said, with even more than usual emphasis to her daughter, the first time Mattie took her mother out in a pony chair, to breathe the sweet fresh air of the early summer among the tender green leaves in the park at Kingsmeadows, \"if Joe's bargain ain't going to turn out so bad as was feared, there's another bargain as you'll be a right down fool to let slip through your fingers.\" Mattie knew what was coming, and she thought it was a trifle mean of her mother to administer her lecture where the person lectured could not make her escape. \" You mean Sir John Beauchamp, mother,\" she said, plainly, as the quickest method of stoppingthe discussion ; \" but he is not my bargain, and I am not his ; at least, my father's money might have been some time ago, but he has thought better of it, I am happy to say, for the Sake of his credit, since he is a very good fellow, though"], [371, "SIR JOHN'S CHAMPION. 359 he is nothing to me. You would not have me married for money ? \" \"You ain't speaking the truth, Mattie,\" said her mother, severely, \" and I don't know but as it is the first falsehood I ever heard you tell.\" \" Mother! \" protested Mattie, trying to look shocked, but unable to restrain a ripple of laughter. \" Daughter ! \" responded Mrs. Hobbs, with complete gravity. \"You're begging the question,\" she went on. \" I don't say as your father's money weren't in his thoughts when he first made up to you, small blame to him, poor chap, as had been put on no better track than a soldier's, and had no hope or chance of earning a shilling above and beyond his pay \u2014 beggarly for the likes of he, with a handle to his name, exposing him to additional expense. He had naught but a lonely, wasted life on half-pay to look forward to, and he a born family man as ever was \u2014 full of diversions as he could make for hisself, a helpful creature when he could get the chance, and that fond of children. He could not think to marry without money, brought up as he had been, unless he were willing to bring some woman and her children to misery, and he were not that sort of man by no manner of means. If ever man was tempted to go and try to marry where money was, that man was Sir John. If he had carried out his intention, I'll go bail for him, he would have acted honourable. He would have given his wife good measure for what she brought him even if she had not been such a one as would have catched his fancy to start w7ith. He would have tret her as if she had not owned a penny, and he had loved her from the beginning. But that is all past and done with, for why ? You gave him a bit of your mind on worldlv mindedness so as every woman and most men would have hated you like pison from that moment.

She asked if he had just been having his deferred honeymoon, he was looking so well satisfied with the world and what was in it. He did not know how to answer her, I suppose, so he said yes, and he daresayed the longer a honeymoon was put off the longer it would last. Then she told him she wished she had tried his plan, when her honeymoon might have been less fleeting. After that she had the coolness to say that it was a fine thing of Mr. Hobbs to spend some of his vast fortune on rehabilitating an old family. She hoped the second alliance which was to complete the rehabilitation would not be shorn of the accompanying ceremonies, whether or not the couple chose to consti tute the honeymoon a movable festival.\" \" It was like her ladyship's imperence,\" said the ex working woman, without mincing matters. \" Not that the creature means any great harm, 'cept to make fools stare.

Father says he would willingly let him have the first farm as falls in here at a nominal rent, because he is Con's brother and that, but he don't know, father don't, how to make such a offer to a gentleman as is a gentleman, without mortally offending him. Sir John might think to marry money, but he has never proposed to beg, borrow, or steal it, as we knows on. There is a distinction, though it may look a nice one to them as don't understand. Father says, besides, it would be worser than useless even if he could put Sir John into a farm to-morrow. Father don't believe he could get the price of seed corn and labour, and them taxes, out of the land, even if he got it for next to nothing, with the place stocked out of the purchase money of Sir John's commission to start with. If he take a farm on ordinary terms, him'll muddle away every shilling he can call his own in no time. What do he know of practical agriculture ? He ain't fit to be a working farmer either at home or in them colonies, any more than his sister, or her babby in arms is. He'd make a fine squire with money in his pockets, or a fairish policeman, or a gamekeeper if be looked sharp. What are you laughing at, Martha Hobbs ? It ain't the best of manners to giggle when your mother is putting herself about to tell you the whys and the wherefores of things,\" the speaker broke off, in a huff. \" I beg your pardon,\" Mattie recovered her equanimity and said humbly. \" But it was such a singular selection of callings you made for Sir John.\" \"Being Sir John,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, with spirit, \" there's only one as fits him to a T.

Now, as Mrs. Hobbs had no private fortune, and as, with all her authority, it was not to be supposed that she could, at her discretion, carve out a slice from Mr. Hobbs's huge fortune and invest it in landed property for the benefit of her protege, there was only one way by"], [374, "362 A MORNING MIST. which Sir John could be reinstalled into the dignity of a squire. \" I believe, mother, you have an ambition to hear your daughter called ' my lady,' \" Mattie sought to pique her mother. \"I thought you were above such weak ness.\" \" I has a ambition to see my daughter the wife of as honest and steady a chap and as bonnie a lad as ever was born.

If you wait for a headpiece like my master's, you may stand long at the mill. Old Joe Hobbs, he's enough for a family and a generation. Young Joe and you are spry enough ; I ain't finding fault with your abilities, but they ain't solid like father's ; they'll never match his'n, or do what his has done, though you have the education, the spare time, and the plenty of means as he missed, one and all, when he were your age. But be content, you're spry enough, the pair of you, and Sir John he were none so far behind when it came to the tug of war, as has been proved. What would you be at, Mattie ? Look at Joe and his bargain. Her ain't a Queen of Shebar, or a college and hospital lass like some I knows on, but she's turning out pretty fair, and he's mighty pleased with his choice. She suits him, and that is the main thing, and he thinks there ain't her equal far and near. Take an example by your brother, Martha Hobbs, be reasonable and humble minded.\" \"Mother, to hear you bid me take an example by Joe and Constance ! \" cried Mattie, breathlessly. \" And why shouldn't I ? \" demanded Mrs. Hobbs, calmly. \"The proof of the pudding is the eating of it, ain't it ?

When I'm strong and about again please God, and them are settled at Willowedge within a half-hour's drive, I'll be able to give a look and a hand to her, as I've done to Mrs. Parry at the rectory. The best thing about Con is that she will take a telling, she ain't above being told, like some folks I knows on.\" \" She took her own time to be told,\" murmured poor Mattie, in self-defence. \"Mattie, I tell you again, if there's a being on earth I has an aversion to, it is a girl as is too wise and far above her neighbours to know how to change her mind, and as cannot bend in her conceit to be pitiful and merciful, and make a fine lad well-off and happy.\" \"But, my dear mother, if he no longer seeks to be well-off and happy, in that way, you do not propose to me to suggest that he should change his mind? I confess that he asked me to marry him two years ago. He got his answer then, which has sufficed him, since he has never broached the subject again ; and I make no ques tion never will renew it.\" \"Then I'll put it to him what he means,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, alertly. \" It is easy to see what he wants, but the fellow is modest ; he have been snubbed and sat upon till his spirit is fair broke.\" \" Mother, mother, you'll never think of doing such a thing ! \" cried Mattie, in real alarm and distress. \" To bring your own daughter's name into such a discussion w7ith \u2014 with the other person concerned, to expose him to the extreme awkwardness of having to explain that he has ceased to wish to have anything to do with me ! Why, my dear mother, he may think that I am prompt ing you.\" \" Trust him ! He ain't such a vain puppy,\" said Mrs. Hobbs, quite unmoved. \" Where's the harm in me axing a friendly lad straightforward? If so be he have charged his mind, let him say so ; he is free to do it if he likes, and the affair is over and done with, and no mischief wrought as I can see. On the other hand, it might set his mind at ease, and show him as he had no objections to fear from father and me, as took"], [376, "364 A MORNING MIST. to him from the first, even afore his sister married into our family, and he growed like one of ourselves. We ain't seeking to sell our sons and daughters in the dearest market. What are our riches for, if it ain't to lift us above such a grovelling temptation as us weren't bred to, moreover, as ain't rife in the class we've sprung from ? Me and my master, we pleased ourselves, and so did our brothers and sisters, and neither father nor mother had a word to say again our right of choice.\" \" You are not paying much respect to my right of choice.\" \" Yes, I am. I'm bidding your heart to speak, and your dirty pride to go to the wall. I'm counselling you to wed a good man as loves you true.\" \" But you will not speak to him. You will not set all the rules of society at defiance. You cannot do such an outrageous thing.\" \" Yes, I can, if it ain't committing a sin, or harming a single soul. I ain't a society woman,\" declared Mrs. Hobbs, with manifest truth. \"Martha Hobbs, if you don't look what you're about, you'll have me in one of them bushes \u2014 a wind up as will neither be good for my health nor a credit to your driving.\" For the next two days Mattie resigned every pursuit, and dropped every engagement, to the utter bewilder ment of her devoted subjects. She directed her entire energies \u2014 and there was not a Hobbs of whom it could be said that his or her energies were either few or lan guid \u2014 to the frustration of her mother's declared design, \u2022by keeping Mrs. Hobbs and Sir John Beauchamp apart, aud preventing any private conversation between them. It was a forlorn hope, a desperate device, which could do no more than stave off the evil day. At the end of the second day, when Mattie knew her mother to be safely lying down in her room for the afternoon rest, which she was as reluctant to take as Baby Joe was to submit to his forty morning winks, the watcher relaxed her vigilance, she ventured to go out on the western verandah for a breathing space. It was a day in the end of May, when there was no east wind to mar"], [377, "SIR JOHN'S CHAMPION. 365 the exquisite season. In place of her winter wraps, Mattie wore a white morning gown as if she were welcoming the summer home in the fashion of old English lads and lasses, and in spite of her recent vigil her heart was light and her spirit hopeful at the very moment that she was joined by Sir John Beachamp and knew her struggle had been in vain. She stood staring at the light in the west, and declined to look round at the intruder on her privacy. \" Miss Hobbs,\" he began, abruptly, \" there is an obnoxious topic which I once before introduced into a conversation with you, when you put me down as I deserved ; you treated me and my proposal with the contempt they merited. I was not in earnest so far as being single-minded or single-hearted in the matter, and you dealt out a just condemnation to my meanness and mercenariness. All that is changed, as I think you must have seen long ago. The question, which was an act of hateful policy then, has grown to be everything to me. The first wish of my heart, my best hope for happiness depends upon the answer. If the change in me makes no change in you, as I confess I have not any right to expect, you will tell me so at once. You did not keep me in suspense before, you are too good and kind to prolong the ordeal now.\" Sir John was not a fluent speaker at any time, and at this moment he spoke with agitation and difficulty. But what is to be said for Mattie Hobbs, who was ready of speech and the mistress of many languages, dead and hving, that she should say not a word in response to his appeal ? Sir John did still better when he spoke again, he used her inexplicable dumbness as a weapon wherewith to vanquish her. \"Mattie,\" he cried, reaching out eager hands to her, \" will you be astonished to hear how I have the presumption to interpret your not having a denial to give me when I tell you that it is you, not yours, I covet ?
