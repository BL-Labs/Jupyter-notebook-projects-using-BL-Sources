Awake, awake ; for the morn doth break, The shadows now flee away : The sun doth rise in the eastern skies ; Proclaiming the dawn of day : The smoke lies low, in the plains below, The ground's still wet with dew ; So up and away, to seek your prey ; May the Fates be kind to you.

Inez dame, I want to speak to you, If you will help me to win Zarina's love ; I'll pay you handsome, I'll give you all I get out of the ransom. Inez. What is it you would have me do ? Diego. I love Zarina, as you know, with all my heart, But yet, she loves me not, I ween, I want you now to play the part Of go-between. Speak well of me, whene'er you get the chance ; And in return, your husband's station in the band. I will enhance, For, when the Chieftain dies, or leaves the band, It's settled I succeed him, I command : Then Pedro, who's your husband, shall be No. 2 ; If you will carry out the orders that I give to you."], [8, "2 Inez. I'll do my best (aside) my best to thwart you. (Aloud) I know not if Zarina likes you well enough to wed ; I'll put her to the test, And when I see you next, I'll tell you what she said. Diego. Adieu, till then, And now I'll go, and give my orders to the men. Exit Diego, (r.) Inez. I know that villain's up to nothing good, But still I dare not let him see I have a doubt ; For he would starve me and my hosband, that he would ; Were he to find it out. Zarina loathes him, as she would a snake, That turns to bite. And if she could ; she'd crush: him, short work of him she'd make, And serve him right. But here comes Dobbs, poor fellow, They give him naught to eat, He's getting very low, But as I've nothing for him, I'd best beat a retreat. I'll see if I can go, and catch some fishes in the brook : I've got a piece of cotton, with a bent pin for a hook, That ought to be sufficient. Exit Inez (l.) Enter \u2014 J. Dobbs (r.) J. Dobbs. Forty long years, have I been in this dungeon cell, And never tasted food. At least but very little, it's been a sell ; The grub has not been good. But was it forty, that I said ? I really meant but four, No matter, I will be revenged, for here I have a saw. (Takes out a huge saw.) I'll take each Brigand one by one, And off I'll saw his head : Then I'll be done. Four years ago, these Brigands took me by the ear, And here they've kept me since, and here I'll stop, I fear : They're waiting for a ransom, And say they'll spoil my hash; If it don't come, And they don't get the cash. Music No. 2. SOLO. \u2014 John Dobbs. I really wish I hadn't left England's happy shore, For now that I have left it ; I'll never see it more ; I'm doomed to die a captive, I'll ne'er be free again, For four long years I've waited, and waited but in vain."], [9, "3 (Refrain.) Oh don't I wish I hadn't, I'm really sorry for it, But there, the past has gone beyond recall, I vow, I've been and gone and done it : there's no use frowning on it, But still I wish I hadn't done it now. I really wish I hadn't been captured by this crew. They're trying hard to starve me, the meals I get are few, My clothes are very ragged, my hat is all in holes, My beard is long and tagged, my boots have lost their soles. I really wish I hadn't, come out these parts to see : And then these, horrid brigands, would not have captured me; They're waiting for a ransom, they think my friends will pay, They think it will be handsome, I only hope it may.

The word I've heard, Give me some bread ; and I will call thee ration-ai I will, upon my word. I've starving been for weeks, Just mark these sunken eyes, These hollows in my cheeks : These shrunken limbs, which once were so ire-mendous. They fill yon with surprise? You're hoping for a ransom, You'll get the price of only bones, instead of something handsome. Don. C. Enough, these sentiments are out of place, You do not seem to know that we are starving, see my face, No capture has been made for past a week, We hunger and we thirst; and all are weak. We've tried our last resource When our next victim's fleeced, let's hope 'twill be a sheep Then you sliall have a chop with lots of sauce, Meanwhile resume your sleep. Do you forget, for four long years, we've nurtured thee'f or naught? And if the ransom comes not soon, 'twere better you should starve Than all our rations halve, Let that be food for thought."], [10, "4 John D. (Aside) I must dissemble (aloud) Friend Chieftain, do be calm, I knew not that the pangs of hunger touched thee sore, Your face and figure do disguise it well, I meant no harm. I'll say no more : But why should hunger treat me worse than you, I cannot tell ? Don. C Listen. Music No. 3. SOLO.\u2014 Don Carlos. There's nothing like feeling quite hungry, when really there's nothing to eat, For then when dry bread is your portion ; you fancy you're having a treat. There's nothing like feeling quite thirsty, when really there's nothing to drink For then when you get only water ; your liking for whiskey you sink. There's nothing like feeling quite shiv'ry, when really there's nothing to wear, For then when you do get some clothing, you find out the parts which are bare There's nothing like ribbons and laces, to tie on one's bonnets and shoes, There's nothing like sweet pretty faces ; to cure an attack of the blues. There's nothing like water to wash in : For writing there's nothing like ink, For hunger there's nothing like eating ; with whiskey and soda to drink, There's nothing like sleep when you're weary, there'snothing like rock for a bed, There's nothing like sand flies to worry, and \"mosquitoes to buzz round your head. There's nothing like 'baccy' for smoking, there's nothing like horses to race, There's nothing like fish bones for choking, and making you blue in the face, There's nothing like celuloid collars, to lessen a washerman's bill, There's nothing like plenty of dollars, the pockets of brigands to fill.

John D. They'll make a sumptuous dish, But you got them where ? Where, I should like to know ? Inez. I caught them with a pin and piece of cotton in the bubbling brook below- John D. Oh unkind Fate, here have I been for past four years and never thought, That fishes in the water could be caught. I might as well have been with Stanley, Or any other man as manly : Who, starving by a river \u2014 quite forgot To catch the little fishes for his pot. Don't lose the pin \u2014 may be there's only one ; so Lend it me awhile, sweet dame \u2014 I'll dangle for the minnow. Exit John Dobbs and Inez (l.) Enter Zarina (c.) Zarina.

He fears that when they found he'd gone; they'd make me rue it. I'd like to get away from here and go and see the shops, And talk a little scandal at the monthly Monday \" Pops\" It's one incessant \"I'm at home\" without a single guest, 0' for the wings of a turtle-dove ; to fly to a place of rest."], [13, "7 Music No. 6.

E'er since my childhood's days, here do I roam, Longing, I look for the day : When I shall give up these hills as our home, And hie me away \u2014 far away. Patiently waiting for freedom to go, Whithersoever I will : Longing to roam in the country below, Loneliness threatens me still, Oft' have I fancied our home in the West, Pictured the shops I should see : Dreamt of the face of the man I loved best, How I do long to be free.

Real love is constant \u2014 always the same \u2014 Never is fickle \u2014 ever is true \u2014 Never is altered \u2014 even in name, Professed by many \u2014 known to the few."], [14, "8 (Duet.) So give us love \u2014 love that is real, One that is ever for woe or for weal : Oh for such love, the maiden doth sigh, Love is eternal \u2014 never to die. Inez. Hate is a word, which were better unknown, Hatred's a weakness \u2014 well left alone, Hatred's a vice, and it brings with it ills, And ever our cup of discordance it fills. Hatred's remorseless \u2014 always unkind \u2014 Never forgetful \u2014 never the same \u2014 Never forgiving \u2014 bitter in mind \u2014 Eager to harm one \u2014 ready to blame. (Duet.)

If e'er a smile I see upon your childish face ; My curse shall wither it, as fire that burns, And all your smiles to frowns, shall thus give place, In turns.

I have, but heed you not, You fiend, you are no man ; To curse a girl, and do her all the harm you can, Because she loves you not. You are but mortal, you shall see ; If you but dare to carry out your threat to me ; My arm, though weak, a killing blow will give ; And rid the earth of one not fit to live. Diego.

Yon maiden threatened that she'd take my life ; If I molested her, and tried to make her be my wife, I must confess she's game. Inez. I don't think that she's making game of you, Or that she'd play thee foul, But she told me most distinctly, with all her heart and soul, That you might plead till all was blue ; And then she'd rather die than marry you.
