The subject selected to form the argument of the following Poem, is taken from the most glorious portion of the history of the greatest nation on the face of the earth ; and during the reign of the best of monarchs. In choosing, however, a suitable theme for the Muses, I was not guided by judgment alone, but was principally influenced by a sentiment, which I shall always feel proud and happy in avowing : \u2014 I was induced to select this subject from the love I bear to my King and Country ; a feeling, which I have fondly cherished ever since the light of reason and reflection first dawned on my mind, and expanded the sensibilities of my heart. Succeeding years haye served to strengthen this attachment. And, I trust, that the flame of loyalty and patriotism which warms my bosom, will not be extinguished, but with the vital spark that animates me. The following piece of poetry was the first essay which the Muses made of their maiden powers, and is indicative of the bent of their inclination : it was written at an early period of my life, about the commencement of the war with France, im mediately after the revolution ; it was produced on the eve of a contest which continued to agitate the world for about a quarter of a century."], [14, "3 PREFACE. LINES ADDRESSED TO GREAT BRITAIN. Hail, happy Island ! Heaven's peculiar care ! From every conflict shalt thou rise more fair; Uninjur'd still shalt thou superior rise, And the vain efforts of thy foes despise. Like the foundation of the solid rock, That stands unmoved to each tremendous shock ; Tho' all around thee furious storms maintain A vengeful war, yet rage they shall in vain ; Firm and secure th' unconquer'd rock defies The rage of storms, and thunders of the skies. These lines have proved prophetic, their purport has been fully accomplished. It has pleased the Lord of Hosts to bless Great Britain with an uninterrupted series of the most brilliant and important victories by sea and land. The great Disposer of events has graciously been pleased to crown Britannia with success, and has placed her on the envied summit of glory. While Great Britain remains true to herself, she may, by the blessing of Providence, defy the hostility of the world combined. When the victorious career of Alexander the Great was checked by the ocean, he is said to have wept at there being no more worlds left for him to conquer. Doubtless the spirit of the great and ambitious Napoleon was often grieved within him, in contemplating this unwelcome truth, that Great Britain was an insurmountable obstacle to his obtaining universal dominion."], [15, "PREFACE.

O Thou ! who art by ruling Heaven design'd To be the faithful guardian of mankind ; While balanc'd powers in harmony remain, And nations equipois'd their weight retain, These happy scenes thy pleased attention claim, And kindred states exalt thy gentle name. Applauding nations thy forbearance own, Mild o'er the earth has British splendour shone; But sterner virtues dang'rous time requires, A dauntless mind, and all the martial fires. Thus, on the main, when gentle Zephyrs play, And yon bright orb emits his cheering ray, With heart enliven' d, and with mind serene, The joyful sailors hail the lovely scene: But when the dark'ning clouds all heaven deform, And, vving'd with fury, howls the midnight storm ; When forked lightnings dart athwart the gloom, And threat the seamen with an instant doom ; Conflicting elements in war engage, And lash the vessel with a ten-fold rage ; Superior to the storm, the Pilot's mind Scorns all the fury of the sea and wind ; Rous'd by the blast, he finds resources still, And guides the bark with all his matchless skill. Hark ! from Columbia's shores Discordia cries, And lo ! from neighbouring regions storms arise :"], [16, "XII PREFACE. Resistless moves the dreadful Gallic power, And trembling Europe rues the fatal hour, When Ph\u0153nix-like it rear'd it's horrid head, Among the ruins of it's country bred; Debasing slavery sounds the woeful blast, And the horizon is with gloom o'ercast. Rouse, Britons ! rouse; Oh snatch th' avenging steel, And make the world's great foe your prowess feel. Your King and Country call on you for aid, With reverence be the filial duty paid. See prostrate Nations your protection claim, And know no safety but the British name. To suffering man, Britannia ! succour lend, And be the world's defender, shield, and friend. The following extract from the speech of Sir WILLIAM BURROUGHS, in the Patriotic Meeting at Calcutta, in the year 1798, gives a lively description of the times. \" The real views of the French, had been made apparent to all the world by the negociations at Lisle. Since that memorable transaction, indeed, no reasonable man appears to have entertain ed a moment's doubt as to the objects of the enemy. There our enemies have been put to a final and decisive test : and no man now could doubt, that nothing short of the destruction of our trade, and of that free and happy constitution which has made Great Bri tain the first empire upon earth, could satisfy their rancorous envy and confirmed hatred. There by the candour, coolness, and ability of the British Minister, the mask had been completely removed from the real tyrants and pretended philosophers of France, who"], [17, "PREFACE. XlU covered with the ruin, and drenched in the blood of their unhap py country, and at the very time of their pouring out their perfidious professions of peace and moderation towards all the world, were meditating schemes of the most unbounded ambition, and forging chains for all the nations that surrounded them. This had become so plain and clear at Lisle, that the enemy no longer attempted to dissemble or deceive ; but now hoped, by menace and alarm, to terrify those whom they could not overreach. They had deter mined, if we were to believe their declaration, to invade Great Britain from many different parts of their extended coast ; and are even said to have marched armies, assembled generals, constructed most extraordinary and unheard-of rafts, to make good their pas sage ; and have carried their insolence so far as to propose loans on the credit of anticipated spoil and plunder in England, which they allowed to be the richest country upon earth. Preparations to repel them, they knew, must be made ; and they vainly hoped, that her numerous taxes and heavy debts would incapacitate Great Britain from the expense of much greater efforts. By their mere threats, therefore, they conceived, they could wage successful war on our finances. They hoped to alarm and divide the people, to injure our public credit, and oblige us to submit to the destructive terms, they had at Lisle the insolence to demand. \u2014 Happily, how ever, instead of dividing, they had united the people ; instead of lowering, they had raised the public credit : and they had at length roused the genuine spirit of the British character to resent and chas tise their insolence. In Great Britain were seen such astonishing proofs of power and resources as the world could scarce credit, and every heart and hand were united in the common cause: The clergy and the laity, the nobility and the commonalty, the rich and the poor, the old and the young ; all classes, ranks, and descrip-"], [18, "XIV PREFACE. tion of our fellow subjects, without distinction of age or sex, had come forward with a zeal which may be felt, but cannot be de scribed ; they had sacrificed large portions of their private fortunes for the service of the State. By their truly noble conducttheyhad shown the world the advantages of our glorious constitution, which can alone account for the power and pre-eminence of England, and has enabled her to stand the bulwark of the whole civilized world, the envy of all her enemies, and the admiration of all the other nations of the earth.\" While such loyalty and patriotism were displayed by our fellow subjects in the parent State, the inhabitants of India were animated with the same ardent spirit of zeal and devo tion. Tbe Sister Presidencies of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, nobly vied with each other in evincing their attach ment to our most gracious Sovereign, and love to our exalted country ; as pourtrayed in the following Addresses sent home to his Majesty.

To your Majesty, as the hereditary guardian of that constitution, which has so long continued the admiration and the envy of the whole civilized world, we owe the strongest declarations of our determin ed resolution to support with our lives and fortunes, your Majesty's Government against the machinations and attacks of an ambitious and inveterate enemy, the common disturbers of all settled states, the foes to all religion, morals, order, and genuine freedom ; who, per verting the sacred name of liberty, have established the most awful system of usurpation and tyranny through some of the fairest regions of the globe. On the wisdom of your Majesty's councils, on the patriotism and loyalty of all orders of your Majesty's subjects, on the known brave ry of your armies, on the distinguished valour of your Majesty's fleets, (whose recent victories have even surpassed in splendour the former glorious achievements of the British navy,) under Divine Pro vidence, we confidently rely, for the ultimate confusion and disgrace of all your Majesty's enemies, and for such continued triumphs of the British arms, as shall enable your Majesty to purchase for your"], [20, "PREFACE.

Most Gracious Sovereign, We your Majesty's most faithful subjects, the British Inhabitants of Bombay and its dependencies, animated by an ardent zeal for our country, which we trust will ever be the distinguishing charac teristic of Britons, have exerted our best endeavours, by a general contribution, for supporting the present just and necessary war in which we are engaged, in opposition to an unprovoked combination of your Majesty's enemies. Reflecting with equal pride and gratitude on the blessings we derive from a Constitution which has elevated the national character through ages, and by the security it affords to liberty and property, has roused and maintained a spirit of com mercial adventure, equally productive of public wealth, and indivi dual prosperity, it becomes our duty, as well as our earnest incli nation, to unite for its protection. Of this invaluable system, we regard your Majesty as the faithful guardian, and as further endear ed to us by those amiable personal virtues which are the peculiar ornaments of your character."], [22, "XVIII PREFACE. We feel particular pleasure at this period in congratulating your Majesty on the late success of your naval arms in the Mediterranean under Admiral Nelson, against an inveterate and usurping foe, whose hostility is directed to the destruction of every tie that can bind society in good order and government ; a victory, which, while it has eminently displayed the wisdom and vigilance of your Majes ty's Councils, in the means of its attainment, and the bravery and good conduct of your Officers in its accomplishment, has averted from your subjects in this remote situation an intended blow, which threatened their existence. While we express to your Majesty the exertions of your British Subjects here, in the public cause, it is with much additional satis faction, that we fulfil a duty incumbent upon us, in conveying to you the unsolicited concurrence we have experienced in the Natives of this island, through their different casts, and the aid they have afforded on the present occasion ; effects, which can only be ascrib ed to the benign influence of your Majesty's Government, in the support and protection of all to whom it is extended. With the most fervent wishes for the long continuance of your Majesty's reign, with increase of glory and prosperity, and the enjoyment of your domestic felicity, we have the honor of sub scribing ourselves, with the warmest sentiments of veneration and gratitude, May it please your Majesty, Your Majesty's obedient and faithful Subjects."], [23, "PREFACE. XIX These valuable documents, are indeed, worthy of being pre served. They form, collectively, a just picture of the peri lous times, now happily gone by, which called forth into ac tion, British zeal, devotedness, loyalty, patriotism, and un daunted fortitude. The display of these noble virtues by the nation, during a long and arduous struggle, will serve as an example to succeeding generations of Britons, worthy their imitation in every crisis at which our glorious Constitution is assailed by ambitious and implacable enemies. When I think of the hurricane that lately swept the world, in which Great Britain \"stood firm and unshaken amidst the general wreck of mighty kingdoms:\" \u2014 when I contemplate the glorious scene displayed in the British Empire, where \" every heart and hand were united in the common cause ;\" where \" the clergy and the laity, the nobility and the common alty, the rich and the poor, the old and the young, all classes, ranks, and description of our fellow-subjects,\" forming as it were but one family, had surrounded (either personally or by loyal and dutiful Addresses) the throne of George THE Third, as the Father and august Head of the family, with sincere and ardent offers of support, and with the declaration of their resolution to defend, with their lives and fortunes, the King and Constitution, in the most awful period of the world : \u2014 and, when I consider the series of brilliant and im portant Victories vouchsafed to Great Britain, which com menced on the 1st of June 1794, and was consummated on the plains of WATERLOO in 1815;! cannot help exclaiming, in the"], [24, "PREFACE.

God was their King; and he sometimes interposed visibly in their behalf, and fought for them from heaven. But surely, if we admit the existence of a superintending Providence at all, we must believe that the divine interposition hath been exercised in favour of this country. What Statesman, fifty years ago, would have believed that this nation ever could be what she now is, execute what she has executed, or endure what she has endured ? Surrounded by the flames of war for a series of years, she remains to this hour unhurt, untouched on her own shores ! It is commonly said, that the most extraordi nary event, in the annals of the world, is the revolution of France, and its suddenly-acquired dominion. But there is another event, which is, perhaps, no less remarkable ; and that is, the DEFENCE made by Great Britain against that power.\" In the following Poem, the Muses have culled the fairest flowers* from the Hesperian Gardens of Nature and Revela tion, and have entwined them into wreaths to adorn BRITAN NIA ; and they have placed in her bosom the Rose of Sharon, as an emblem of her tender care and maternal solicitude for * Similes drawn from Nature and Holv Writ, to illustrate and adorn \" The hapfy State of Great Britain.\""], [25, "PREFACE.

Britannia! raise thy joyful eyes; With gratitude to favouring skies Behold thy happyfate ; Th' Almighty deigns to honour thee With mercy, love, and sovereignty, A high and envied state. To constitute a Jubilee, in the highest sense, there must be a knowledge of the true God, a pure faith, a people exulting in the favour of the Almighty, a people animated by loyalty to their King. \" Peace within our walls and prosperity within our palaces.\" It will heighten the grandeur of the occasion, if the people be power ful, and stand conspicuous among nations. All these particulars centre with us. They are to be found in our nation to an extent and degree never known, perhaps, by any"], [84, "54 other people. At the present \u00e6ra, Great Britain stands conspicuous in the eyes of the world : she assumes a commanding attitude ; and has become, by divine providence, the constituted guardian, in a man ner, of the religion and liberties of men. And, behold ! while occupy ing this exalted station, she announces a grand Jubilee, to be cele brated on the occasion of an event which rarely occurs to great empires, \u2014 the arrival of the fiftieth year of her monarch's reign. We are, therefore, this day, to take a review of the goodness that \" the Lord hath done\" by and for the King, his servant, and for us, his people. We shall notice, first, the temporal or political blessings of his reign ; and secondly, those spiritual and religious blessings which we have enjoyed as a Christian people. Among our political blessings we must note, first, the increase of our Power as a nation. It is certainly true, that almost every year of the present reign hath added something to the strength and sta bility of our dominion. It hath during the same period, been greatly increased in extent. Since the \u00e6ra when the present mo narch ascended the throne, the domains of Britain have been near ly doubled in magnitude. We now possess an empire in the East alone, almost equal in dimensions to the continent of Europe. And, in the other divisions of the globe, our ascendancy begins to be acknowledged. Again, we have acquired the dominion of the Sea ; on which, at no remote period, we maintained but an equal conflict with the other nations. Providence hath been pleased to invest this nation with that sovereignty for wise and important purposes, we doubt not, in the present advanced period of the world ; not merely, we would believe, for our own protection and preser vation, or for the maintenance of liberty and social order, during a period . of revolution, in the confined scene of Europe ; but to carry"], [85, "55 the principles of moral civilization and useful knowledge to the re motest nations of the earth, to bring them acquainted with each other as one family, and to impart to them all the inestimable blessing of divine revelation. Another subject of thankfulness is the increasing Opulence of the kingdom. Perhaps, at no former period of the world have \u00c6e blessings of wealth and plenty been more generally, or more largely, distributed in a nation, even to the lowest members of society, than in ours at this time. We have certainly no record of such a general prosperity in the recent history of mankind. And the source of this wealth is obvious. Our Commerce extends to the uttermost parts of the earth: there is probably no \" speech nor lan guage\" where the British name does not begin to be known : and the produce of every clime is brought to our shores. But there is a blessing of another character, and of a higher order, and that is the preservation of our Political Constitution. While we contemplate the dense clouds which envelope and darken the intellectual horizon of other nations, preparing them for that humiliating and abject servitude which threatens them, we shall con sider the preservation of our civil and religious liberties as a chief theme of our thanksgiving on this day. These liberties are not only preserved to us, but, by their duration, seem to be strengthen ed and confirmed. In what perfect harmony, for example, are those apparently discordant parts of our excellent form of govern ment at this time ; and how peaceable are those seemingly opposite interests which compose it ! In every age of our history our Con stitution hath been extolled ; but there certainly never was a peri od when it appeared in more beautiful proportion, or hath attained"], [86, "56 so nearly to a state of perfection, as the present. Who, then, was the Author of this Constitution of which we boast . Was it the peculiar wisdom of the Danes which constructed it? or of the Saxons ? or of the natives of the island ? What is the name of the great legislator who conceived the mighty plan? Was it created by chance or design ? And now that it is formed, can any other nation execute a plan after the great model? We know well by whose council and providence our happy government hath been begun and finished. Our Constitution is the gift of God. And we have to acknowledge his goodness for this blessing, as we thank him for \" Use, and breath, and all things.\" This honour he hath done to our nation, in order that he might execute by us (we would believe) his own great designs, in the fulness of time. The divine wisdom hath ordained for us a Constitution in which great power and pure religion grow up together ; a union which hath never been known to exist in a great empire, to a equal extent, since the commencement of the Christian \u00e6ra. Now let us reflect a moment under what circumstances the various blessings above enumerated have been continued to us; \u2014 this domi nion, opulence, commerce, constitution, and liberty, \u2014 in short, this existence as a powerful, free, and happy people. They have been preserved to us while the powers of the civilized world have combined for our destruction, and assailed our very existence as a nation. How strange would it have appeared to our forefathers, nay, how remote from all political calculation, even of recent times, had it been asserted, that Great Britain would one day wage equal war with the whole of Europe ! and that, in the tempest of a revolution, convulsing the world, this nation should remain firm and unshaken, amidst the general wreck of mighty kingdoms!"], [87, "57 The government of Israel was a theocracy, God was their King ; and he sometimes interposed visibly in their behalf, and fought for them from heaven. But surely if we admit the existence of a su perintending providence at all, we must believe that the divine inter position hath been exercised in favour of this country. What states man, fifty years ago, would have believed that this nation ever could be what she now is, execute what she has executed, or endure what she has endured ! Surrounded by the flames of war for a series of years, she remains to this hour unhurt, untouched on her own shores ! It is commonly said that the most extraordinary event in the an nals of the world is the revolution of France and its suddenly ac quired dominion. But there is another event which is, perhaps, no less remarkable, and that is, the DEFENCE made by Great Britain against that power. Buchanan's British Jubilee Sermon. I think I may say (but meekly let me say it, and with an awful reverence) that Providence watches over this empire with an eye of peculiar regard. England seems to be solemnly selected, and delegated to interpose a barrier between partial subversion and uni versal anarchy ; to punish the punisher of nations ; to heal the wounds of agonizing Europe, and to sit like a wakeful nurse, watch ing at her side, and administering to her lips the medicine of salva tion. We stand on a noble but a dreadful elevation ; responsible in ourselves for the future happiness of the human race. We have a spirit, a constitution, and a religion ; unrivalled, unparalleled, un precedented. From these I draw my politics, and these tell me, we shall triumph.

Let us, therefore, in the first place, in the words of Israel \" Bless the King.\" Let us send forth our ardent supplications, that God would continue to make him a partaker of the greatest and best blessings ; \" that he would endue him plente ously with heavenly gifts,\" and also grant him the inferior blessings (if it be his will) \" in health and wealth long to live.\" And let us pray for his family, that his sons may walk in his steps ; that the glory of the kingdom maybe increased (like Solomon's), and not di minished under the reign of his successor. \u2014 The virtues of the Sovereign have, indeed, been a great blessing to the nation ; but the greatest blessing is the gratitude of his people ; I mean their ability to value his virtues, and their possessing a just and grateful sense of their beneficial effects on themselves. And this gratitude, we aver, is founded on knowledge ; chiefly, on that religious and moral knowledge, which enables men to appreciate virtue ; and again, on a knowledge of the circumstances of the nation, and of its state in relation to other nations. For almost every man of or-"], [92, "62 dinary education is not only acquainted with his own country, but has a picture of the world before him ; and is enabled to under- stand the purposes and ends of that power which is convulsing the world and would enslave it. This knowledge, then, is an ines- timable blessing. It is that which distinguishes our nation at this moment from other nations ; and it is the instrument which God is pleased to use, not only, we trust, to preserve ourselves, but others ; not only to defend the Christian religion at home, but ,to extend it throughout the world. But take away the Bible and the instruc- tion of the lower classes, and we shall soon fall into that darkness which envelopes the other nations of Europe. Neither science, nor philosophy, nor the fine arts, could ever enlighten the public mind as it is now enlightened. Neither conquest nor commerce could add any thing to our public virtue. The fountain of our know- ledge and of our happiness is the Bible ; and the greatest blessing we can render our country is to call every poor person, and teach him to drink from this fountain. \u2014 Let us, then, obey the commands of our Saviour, and allow the Gospel to be read and heard by the poor. And, in particular, let Christian instruction be given to the poor. For, how incalculable is the benefit, if we believe the Chris- tian revelation ! He who teaches a child to read, and think, and feel, and then gives him a Bible, hath performed a nobler work than if he had bestowed on that child all the riches of the habitable globe. It is proper to record the sentiments of our gracious Sovereign on this subject. He patronizes schools for the instruction of the poor in the most earnest manner, and hath publicly expressed his wish \" that every poor child in the nation should be able to read the Bible.\" This is a sentiment worthy of a Christian king; and the example he hath given is worthy of the universal imitation of his Christian subjects.

'Midst tempest's roar Though yon torn hark strike on the shore, Death hover o'er his prey ; See Greathead on the angry deep In his Life-Boat the surges sweep, And snatch the crew away. Extract from the Tyne Mercury of the 29th November, 1803. Having yesterday witnessed the most extraordinary escape of the crew of the brig Bee from shipwreck that was perhaps ever known, by means of the Northumberland Life-Boat ; I take the most early opportunity of giving you a correct statement of the whole cir cumstances. The brig Bee of Shields, John Houston, master, hav ing put to sea in an easterly wind, had not proceeded far when it began to blow strong from the south east, which obliged her in a few hours to put back. In taking Tynemouth Bar at the last quarter ebbs in a very heavy sea, she struck the ground, and unshipped her rudder. Being now completely unmanageable, she drifted towards the north side of the Bar, and at length drove on the Black Middens. They who have witnessed the tremendous sea which breaks on the north east part of the harbour, in a south-easterly wind, may form a conception of the dreadful state in which the crew of the vessel was situated, in the midst of rocks, where the sea runs mountain high, so as frequently to obscure the ship, and where any vessel might be expected immediately to go to pieces. Their only refuge from being swept into the gulf was to climb up into the shrouds, which the captain with six men and boys (being the whole of the"], [95, "65 crew) with difficulty effected. The dangerous situation in which they were placed immediately attracted an immense number of spectators from both North and South Shields. The shores in every direction were lined with people, who expressed, by their anxious looks, the most sympathetic apprehensions for their safety. The making use of the Life-Boat was by most people thought im- possible, and at all events, the attempt was attended with extreme danger, owing to the tremendous sea, and the immense rocks which lay where the vessel was stranded. So confident, however, was Mr. Greathead, the inventor, of the Life-Boat being able to live in any sea if properly managed, that he, without hesitation and with the greatest alertness, volunteered his services to bring off the men from the brig. This intrepid offer operated like electricity among the sailors. Immediately the Northumberland Life-Boat was launch- ed, and manned with Mr. Greathead and South Shields pilots. In the course of a few minutes they reached the vessel without much difficulty, and picked off the men from the shrouds, shivering with cold, and almost perished with fatigue. One man in making too much haste to enter the boat fell into the breakers, but was imme diately recovered. When the whole crew was in the boat, they rowed towards the shore, and in less than an hour from the time the boat was launched did they return in safety to the South Shields, without a single accident. This is certainly the most astonishing and hazardous expedition that any Life-Boat has ever yet attempted ; and from the ease and safety with which she went to and from the brig, having shipped very little water, it can scarcely be conceived what she may be ca pable of effecting. K"], [96, "66 The joy that appeared to pervade the people on shore, when the boat returned in safety, may more easily be conceived than de scribed. This successful enterprise has added another laurel to the inventor of the Life-Boat (Mr. Greathead), and additional lus tre to the Duke of Northumberland, and the other benevolent pa trons of an invention, which has rendered such important service to the cause of humanity.

Extracts from the Report of the Introduction and Progress of Vaccine Inoculation in Bengal, by John Shoolbred, Esq. Superin tendent General of Vaccine Inoculation, under date the 22d March 1804. The year 1 798 was the auspicious era in which the world was first made acquainted with the happy discovery of Dr. Jenner. The practice of vaccine inoculation was begun in London in January 1799, and has ever since been rapidly increasing in"], [97, "67 Europe, and gradually extending its benefits to every quarter of the globe. The accounts of the new inoculation published in England, soon reached this country, and excited, as might have been expected, a very lively interest in all the members of the medical profession, who anticipated with anxiety and pleasure, the acquisition of a discovery, which promised an exemption from pain, misery, and premature death, to so large a portion of mankind. In contemplating a period so auspicious to the happiness of man - kind, and so glorious to the name of Jenner, one cannot help anti cipating, that, while an approving sovereign and an admiring country do justice to the talents, wisdom, and energy so eminently display ed in the military and political career of our Most Noble and Illus trious Governor General; it will not escape the notice of the phi losopher and the philanthropist, that the same distinguished ad ministration was no less conspicuous for the humanity than for the vigour of its measures ; and that to the encouragement afforded to the vaccine inoculation by His Excellency the Most Noble Mar quis Wellesley, so large a portion of the globe has been indebted for the enjoyment derivable from the greatest discovery that ever was made by man for the benefit of his fellow creatures. k2"], [98, "68 STANZA XXXVIII.

The first event is, the abolition of the slave-trade. \" In his days\" the reproach of Britain hath been taken away; and a jubilee hath been given to Africa for ever. The other event is, the establishing of the Bible Society. By means of that institution, Great Britain may be now represented as standing in the attitude of presenting the Word of God to all the world, a blessing of greater magnitude than any other which the world can ever receive from Great Britain as a nation.

In these last times the trumpets blow The deadly blasts of human woe, And plagues on men are hurl'd ; See nation after nation fall, Fierce wars the tribes of th' earth appal, Convulse the trembling world. The prophet having separately detailed the effects of the two first tvoe trumpets in the East and in the West, and having briefly touch ed upon the sounding of the third, now proceeds to give us a more full account of the miseries which it should produce. For this purpose he divides it into seven periods, which he distinguishes by the pouring out of seven phials ; and to show us that they are all comprehended under the last woe trumpet, the commencement of the blast of which he had already announced, he styles them the seven last plagues, &c. &c. We have already seen that the third woe trumpet began to sound on the 12th August 1792; immediately the limited monarchy of France was overthrown, when the tyrannical reign of liberty and equality commenced. This being the case we must look for the pouring out of all the seven vials, which form so many distinct periods of the third woe trumpet, posterior to the 12th August 1792.

What a splendid spectacle does Great Britain present ! Stand ing firm amidst the overthrow of the nations, and spreading wide the shadow of her wings for the protection of all, she finds herself at leisure, amidst the tumults of war, to form benevolent projects for the best interests of mankind. Her generals and her admirals have caused the thunder of her power to be heard throughout the earth ; now her ministers of religion perform their part, and en deavour to fulfil the high destinies of Heaven in favour of their country. They called on their fellow creatures to cheer the de sponding nations with the Book of the promises of eternal Use, and thus afford them that consolation, from the prospect of a happier world, which they have little expectations of finding amidst the disasters and calamities of this. The summons was obeyed. As fast as the nature of the undertaking became understood, and per ceived to be clearly distinct from all party business and visionary projects, great numbers of all ranks in society, and all persuasions in religion, joined with one heart and one soul, and began to impart freely to all men that which, next to the Saviour, is God's best gift to man. The Rev. Henry Martyn's Appeal."], [101, "71 There is another source of the increased attention to religion in this country, which demands our grateful acknowledgment on this day, and that is, the laudable desire, now so general in this nation, of communicating religious knowledge to other nations. The beneficial operation of this solicitude, for the happiness of others, is far more extensive than is generally supposed. And it is natural to expect it ; for even if the solicitude were unnecessary, if the success were visionary, yet the endeavour is virtuous. It is of itself, it must be confessed, a noble and disinterested purpose ; and the exercise of it tends to improve the very best principles and affections of our nature. But the effect is no longer doubt ful. The concern for others hath had a reflective and salutary opera tion on ourselves, by exciting more attention to religion at home. Thus have we experienced that \" mercy is twice blessed, blessing him that gives and him that takes.\" Thus have we proved the truth of our Saviour's words, \"Give, and it shall be given unto you ; good measure, pressed down, and shaken tocether, and running over shall men give into your bosom.\" These blessings have been vouchsafed to us under the auspices of a King who is truly a Defender of the Faith, and \" a nursing father to his peo ple.\" Thus hath it pleased Divine Providence to distinguish the reign of King George the Third by circumstances of high and lasting honour.

Cemented it with blood ; Thy Doctrine built upon this rock, The modern Atheist's hellish shock It firmly hath withstood. We have to adore the divine goodness, that the faith of our Church hath remained impregnable and unmoved by the shock of infidelity. There was a time, even within the period of the present reign, when the progress of religious unbelief was awfully rapid amongst Christian nations. Infidelity was the germ of those revo lutions, which have destroyed the social and political relations of Eu rope. It is well known, that the power which is now overwhelm ing kingdoms, first appeard in the character of infidelity. And it3 spirit, probably, still pervades the body, though it hath assumed a religious form. It hath assumed such a form from necessity ; for a monarchy, which is a type of the government of God, cannot well subsist without the acknowledgment of a religion. We have, therefore, to magnify the divine mercy that our Church remains firm and unshaken in the Doctrines of her Founders ; in those scriptural Doctrines which no national Church of equal ex tent, that we know of, in any age or country, ever exhibited in greater purity, or for a greater length of time. Survey the whole circle of Christian Churches in the world at this day ; contemplate dispassionately their individual character and efficiency, since the"], [103, "73 period of the Reformation ; and then say, whether any one of them hath been so honoured of God as the Church of England ? Whe ther any one of them hath opposed such a barrier to the progress of Infidelity, or hath produced so many volumes of genuine piety, profound learning, and erudite theology, as the Church of England \u2014 that Church which was founded and established by confessors and martyrs in the presence of the Christian world ? Every man who is qualified to take a large and liberal view of the present state of the Church of Christ, and who knows what has been passing in it since the first century, will be able to answer this question. Such a person will be able to acknowledge the peculiar favour, which it hath pleased God to manifest towards the established communion of England ; and which hath been so manifested for the accomplish ment of the great and important purposes of his providence. And this divine favour hath also been extended, as it respects purity of faith and tranquil duration, to the established Church of Scotland. Scotland is our Sister in Church and State ; and she would now consider an injury done to the Church of England as being fatal ultimately to herself. What then, let us inquire, have been the purposes of Divine Providence, in the permanent establishment of the true faith in these kingdoms ? These purposes begin to be un folded in the development of events. They appear in that great work now imposed on our nation ; I mean, in the contest she is now maintaining with the enemy of mankind ; since, whatever honour is assigned to the State, for its defence of the rights and liberties of men, is derived, ultimately, from the duration of the national Church. For in this warfare, and in the spirit and motive which animate it, we cannot speak of the State as distinct from the Church. The ho nour of the grand defence is due to that union of great power and L"], [104, "74 pure doctrine, which we before noticed. It would be fatal to the State, if the Church were overthrown ; how much more fatal would it be to religion, and to the peace and purity of religion in this country ? Consider for a moment, the consequences that would ensue, if the constitution of our Church were at this time to be de stroyed. There would follow, probably, a scene of religious anar chy and licentious opinion in this land, no less to be dreaded than if the monarchy itself were destroyed. Let every man, then, who loves his country, and knows how to appreciate religious liberty, pray for the stability and permanency of the Church of England. Buchanan's British Jubilee Sermon.

COMMENTARY. The shadow of thy wings.] The shadow of wings is a very useful image in prophetic language for protection afforded by the stronger to the weak. God's protection of his servants is described by their being safe under the shadow of his wings. And in this pas-"], [109, "79 sage, the broad shadowing wings may be intended to characterize some great people who should be famous for the protection they should give to those whom they received into their alliance ; and I cannot but think that this is the most simple and natural exposi tion of the expression. Mr. Faber says, he would rather translate the passage, Ho! land of the perpetual shadow of sails. In either case it is equally applicable to a great maritime nation. To send Messengers^] The original word may be taken for per sons employed between nation and nation for the purpose, either of nesociation or commerce. Bulrush Vessels.] Navigable vessels are certainly meant. If the country spoken of be distant from Egypt, vessels of bulrush are only used as an apt image, on account of their levity, for quick sailing vessels of any material. The country, therefore, to which the prophet calls, is characterized as one which, in the days of the completion of the prophecy, should be a great maritime and com mercial power, forming remote alliances, making distant voyages to all parts of the world with expedition and security, and in the habit of affording protection to their friends and allies, &c. &c. A nation dragged away.] The dispersed Jews : a nation drag \u2022 ged away from its proper seat, and plucked of its wealth and pow er; a people wonderful from their beginning to this very time for the special providence which ever has attended them, and directed their fortunes; a nation still lingering in expectation of the Mes siah, who so long since came, and was rejected by them, and now is coming again in glory ; a nation universally trampled under foot ; whose land rivers, armies of foreign invaders, the Assyrians, the"], [110, "80 Babylonians, Syro-Macedonians, Romans, Saracens, and Turks have over-run and depopulated. At that season a present shall be led-] Immediately after the purgation of the Church, at the very time, when the bird of prey, with all the beasts of the earth, Antichrist with his rebel rout, shall have fixed his seat between the seas, in the holy mountain, a pre sent shall be brought,\u2014 the nation described in verse 2d, as those to whom the swift messengers are sent, after their long infidelity shall be brought as a present unto Jehovah. They shall be con verted to the acknowledgment of the truth, and they shall be brought to the place of the name of Jehovah, to Mount Zion : they shall be settled in peace and prosperity, in the land of their origi nal inheritance. This, then, is the sum of the prophecy, and the substance of the message sent to the people dragged away and plucked. That, in the latter ages, after a long suspension of the visible interposition of Providence, God, who all the while regards that dwelling place which he will never abandon, and is at all times directing the events of the world to the accomplishment of his own purposes of wis dom and mercy, immediately before the final gathering of his elect from the four winds of heaven, will purify his Church by such sig nal judgments as shall rouze the attention of the whole world, and, in the end, strike all nations with religious awe. At this period, the apostate faction will occupy the holy land. This faction will certainly be an instrument of those judgments by which the Church will be purified. That judgment is not at all"], [111, "81 inconsistent with the seeming prosperity of the affairs of the athe istical confederacy \u25a0 but after such duration, as God shall see fit to allow to the plenitude of his power, the Jews, converted to the faith of Christ, will be unexpectedly restored to their ancient pos sessions. The swift messengers will certainly have a considerable share, as instruments in the hand of God, in the restoration of the chosen people : otherwise, to what purpose are they called upon (verse 1.) to receive their commission from the prophet? It will perhaps be some part of their business to afford the Jews the assis tance and protection of their fleets. This seems to be insinuated in the imagery of the 1st verse. But the principal part they will have to act, will be that of the carrier of God's message to his peo ple. This character seems to describe some Christian country, where the prophecies relating to the latter ages will meet with par ticular attention, where the literal sense of those which promise the restoration of the Jewish people will be strenuously upheld, and where they will be so successfully expounded as to be the principal means, by God's blessing, of removing the veil from the hearts of the Israelites. Those who shall be the instruments of this blessed work, may well be described as the carrier of God's mes- sage to his people, &c. &c. Bishop of St. Asaph's Letter on Isaiah xviii. About the expiration of the 1260 years, the eyes ot one great divi sion of the scattered Jews will be opened ; and they will joyfully embrace the faith of that Redeemer, whom they have so long reject ed and despised. In effecting, first their conversion, and after wards their restoration, some mighty maritime nation of faithful wor shippers -will be principally instrumental. To this great division. M"], [112, "82 of Judah, destined to be brought to the knowledge of the truth, while yet in the land of their dispersion, the maritime worshippers will be sent, the appointed messengers of God, in swiftly sailing vessels ; and, reverently obedient to the divine command, they will bear them safely in a mighty fleet, as a present to the Lord of Hosts, to the place of his holy name, even Mount Zion. The Jews, there fore, who are thus converted* and brought back by sea, must clear ly be such Jews as shall be scattered either thro ugh the dominions and colonies of the maritime power ; or through those ot other smaller maritime nations in alliance with, and professing the same faith as, the great naval power itself.

The kingdoms of this world are o'er, 3Iortals shall rule on earth no more, Nor regal honours claim; Tri-une Jehovah reigns alone, Ye nations! bow before his throne, Adore his holy name. When tbe traveller, who has been overtaken in the wilds of Africa by the shades of night, before he could reach his destined place of safety, hears the famished wolves howl, and the fierce and hungry lions roar around, with what eagerness he looks for the re turn of day to chase them to their dens, and deliver him from his fears ! Perhaps with still keener longing, the mariner, whose vessel,"], [113, "83 tossed by the winds in a tempestuous night, has struck on a reef of rocks where the waves break over her from time to time, sighs for the morning light, that he may see if there be land in view, and if possible effect his escape. To ascend to a higher theme, are there not multitudes of the disciples of Christ, who, in this spiritual dark-, ness of the church \u2014 dreading the cries of those grievous wolves which are attempting to devour the flock of the Redeemer, and trembling at the fearful sound of that roaring lion, who goeth about seeking whom he may devour \u2014 are with the most intense desires looking for that joyful season to the church, when no ravenous beast shall be there to disturb the repose of the saints ; and Satan shall be bound a thousand years. How many Christians are there, who, like the shipwrecked mariner, are lifting up their heart and their voice, for the light of the millennial day to put an end to all those storms which have endangered the peace and safety of the church, and to introduce that lasting calm and security which the spirit of prophecy has taught us to expect ! Or shall we consider the subject as better illustrated by a more hallowed resemblance ? The Lord Jesus predicted that, on the third day after his crucifixion, he should rise from the dead. Can you conceive the eagerness of desire, and the vivid trembling of hope, with which his disciples looked forward to the day when the Saviour, whom they saw expire on the accursed tree, should be raised from the grave, and bless them with his presence and his love ? And are there not tens of thousands of the followers of the Lamb with equal ardour directing their eyes to the joyful period, when the Lord Jesus shall be beheld arrayed in a glory in which he never appeared before; and when there shall be seen with him those m2"], [114, "84 blessed and holy ones who have a part in the first resurrection, over whom the second death shall have no power ? Do they not cry out, \" O when will the shadows of the night of ignorance, su perstition, idolatry, and wickedness flee away ! when will the day of the Redeemer's glory dawn, and the Sun of Righteousness arise on all the nations of the earth j \u2014 and what will the duration of that season of delights be !\" Without taking upon me to name the precise year of the com mencement of Antichrist's reign, shall I suppose it will have ceased, and the Millennium commence about the two thousandth year of the Christian era, and the seventh thousand of the years of the world's existence prove a glorious sabbatic day of rest and peace and joy? Perhaps it would disappoint the ardent hope of its earli er approach, which some fondly entertain : and I think I can per ceive the disappointment expressed in your sorrowful looks. But if you view the subject with attention, there will be no cause either for disappointment or for grief, but infinitely much for gladness and rejoicing. You have not even the shadow of a reason for ceasing from your benevolent exertions in despondency ; but the best and most forcible of reasons for proceeding in your endeavours to hast en the glory of the latter days, with all the ardour of the most lively hope, and with the fullest assurance of seeing greater things in the success of the Gospel than the world has yet beheld. So delightful a state of the world must charm every one who has a heart to feel for the honour of God and the happiness of the human race. But how long will this paradisaical state continue > is a question which all will naturally ask. For an answer, let us"], [115, "85 have recourse to the law and to the testimony, meekly consult the oracles of God, and reverently attend to the response they utter. \" O that it may be of long, long duration,\" is your fervent wish. Listen to the voice of God, and receive the answer from his lips. The prophet Isaiah, speaking of that season, describes its duration in the following terms, ch. lx. 15: \" Whereas thou hast been for saken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, the joy of many generations.\" That by these expressions, a long period of time is denoted, all will allow : how long, none can say. But the precise space, which is not mark ed by the Old Testament prophets, is specified in the New : and, what is exceedingly remarkable, six times within the compass of the first seven verses of the chapter, from which the text is taken, it is declared to be a thousand years. Some expositors of the Apocalypse have argued, that the pro phecy in the text is not to be understood in a literal sense. Ac cording to their interpretation, instead of a thousand common years, as a year consists of 365 days, each of these days signifies a year; so that the whole will amount to 365,000 years. Such they conceive to be the duration of the Millennium : and we need not wonder that they exult in their interpretation, as present ing to view a period so immense during which knowledge, sanctity, and happiness will reign over the face of the whole earth; and so vast a revenue of glory will accrue to God and to his Christ, from the salvation of a multitude which no man can number. The prospect is so extensive and so grand, that in gaz ing on the scenes which surround us on every side, and stretch away almost to the bounds of the everlasting hills, we are lost in wonder and amazement."], [116, "86 By a more numerous class of students of the prophetic doctrine, the words of the text are interpreted according to their natural meaning, and are conceived to signify precisely a thousand years, and neither more nor less. Should it be granted, that the Christian prophet uses a definite for an indefinite number \u2014 a thousand years for a long succession of ages: \u2014 this, I think, may be confidently asserted for the honour of God, \u2014 that mankind will be no losers by this interpretation; \u2014 that the Millennium will not be less than a thousand years, but it may be more; and every year is unspeakably precious, as a year of know ledge, holiness, and felicity, over the face of the whole earth. When the Millennium arrives, it will display the redemption of sinners in all its splendour. The divine plan from eternity ; the person of the Mediator as God manifest in the flesh ; the infinite merit of his obedience ; the atonement made by his sufferings unto death, and the intercession at the Father's right hand ; the bless ings resulting from the mediation of Christ, pardon and reconciliation with God, the sanctification of the soul by the Holy Ghost, commu nion with Jehovah here and eternal felicity in heaven : these grand truths, which form the outlines of redemption, will be distinctly understood and cordially received, and produce the most delight ful effects. Sanctity of character, loyalty to God, benevolence to the whole family of man, harmony in private life, peace between nations, and an extraordinary degree of happiness \u2014 these will be extended, with the Gospel which produced them, over the face of the whole globe. \u2014 From the rising of the sun to his going down, it is now evident, that the Lord is King over all the earth. By the"], [117, "87 love and dutifulness of the subjects, the excellence of the ruler and of his government will be displayed ; and it will be displayed also in the communication of extraordinary measures of happiness to all who are under his dominion. There shall be no more curse ; then shall the earth yield her increase; abundance shall every where reign ; and contentment, peace, and joy, fill the hearts of the people in every nation. Then will this hymn of praise be sung in the loudest strains : \" The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.\" Bogue on the Millennium. At the beginning of the time of unexampled trouble, that is to say, at the expiration of the 1260 years, (which commenced in the year 606,) the Almighty will put forth his hand to bring back his ancient people the Jews to the country of their fathers ; and, when Antichrist is overthrown, the lost ten tribes of Israel will likewise be restored, henceforth to form only one people with Judah, (these events will occupy a space of 75 years more;) then will the first re surrection take place, and the Millennium will commence. That there will be a preternatural manifestation of the Messiah at this eventful period, we have, I think with Mr. Mede, reason to expect. The Millennium, which is styled the reign of Christ aad his saints upon earth, or the reign of the symbolical mountain, will comprize the space, either of 1000 years, or of 365,000 years, according as the number predicted be composed of natural or prophetic years. Which of the two be intended by St. John, the event must deter-"], [118, "88 mine : the first seems the most probable ; yet I see not why any person should be blamed for supposing that the Apostle meant the second ; as it is well observed by Dr. Paley, \" We ought constant ly to bear in mind this momentous truth, that, in the hands of the Deity time is nothing, that he has eternity to act in. The Chris tian dispensation, nay the world itself, may be in its infancy. A more perfect display of the power of Christ and of his religion may be in reserve, and the ages which it may endure after the obsta cles and impediments to its reception are removed, may be, be yond comparison, longer than those which we have seen, in which it has been struggling with great difficulties, and most especially with ignorance and prejudice.\" Faber's Dissertation on the Prophecies.

Calcutta, March, 1812. MONODY ON THE DEATH OF THE EARL OF MINTO. THUS man decays, thus earthly visions fade, And life's bright scenes dissolve in empty shade; Polygnotus painted, for Greece, the detailed achievements of his countrymen. Pausanius has described the pictures. It would well become the liberality and princely grandeur of British India, to set on foot a plan so gratifying and pa triotic. Every man who is proud of contemplating examples of private munifi cence, will acknowledge with pleasure, the feeling and generosity of the illus trious person who has resolved, at his own expence, to erect a Monument to the memory of those brave officers and men, who fell gloriously in the conquest of Bourbon, Mauritius, and Java."], [188, "156 Day after day the mortal chain is riven, No stay unfragile but the hope of heaven. Yet though unceasing is the fate we find, And death still holds the mirror to the mind, Scarcely we feel the universal doom, Which hurries man unthinking to the tomb ; Till friends fall off, and those at length depart, Whom fond affection binds around the heart ; Then bursts the sigh \u2014 the tears unbidden flow, And all the soul is desolate with woe. 5 10 The mournful strain now echoing from the shore, Breathes the sad tale that Minto is no more ! How oft, ere India vanished from his sight, Had fancy painted scenes of proud delight, When native bowers should open to his view, And age be solaced 'midst the kindred few; There, when the toils of public life were o'er, Enjoy the calm of leisure yet in store ! Those crags which raise their summits to the sky, Still loved, still seen in fancy's roving eye, Were wont to yield to his untravelled heart, That rapturous joy which scenes of home impart; That magic charm which soothes the exile's woe, With strongest feeling bade his bosom glow ; Years had not dimmed the prospect, but more bright, The well-known woodlands struck his mental sight; 15 25"], [189, "157 The copse, the dell, and all which childhood knew, In fair array his kindled memory drew. 30 Full of the thought, how oft his eye retraced, The pictured rock by foliage dark embraced ; And fondly marked the rugged path which led, To BarnhiU's rude traditionary bed; These to survey near Tiviot's wandering tide, Compassed by friends had been his dearest pride: But Heaven forbade, relentless to destroy, And snatched away the boon of promised joy. 35 Now all is past ; in vain he sought to close, A well-spent life in dignified repose; Fled is that soul where honor sate enthroned, Inspired with thought which every virtue owned ; 40 Line 32. \u2014 The pictured rock.] This was a view of Minto Crags, painted by the author, which his Lordship always contemplated with delight. Walter Scott, in the Lay of the last Minstrel, has thus described the subject of the picture. \" On Minto Crags the moon-beams glint, \" Where Barnhill hewed his bed of flint; \" Who flung his outlawed arms to rest, \" Where falcons hang their giddy nest, \" 'Mid cliffs, from whence his eagle eye, \" For many a league his prey could spy.\" To these lines the following note is prefixed. \" A romantic assemblage of \" cliffs, which rise suddenly baove the vale of Tiviot, in the immediate vicinity \" of the family seat, from which Lord Minto takes his title. A small plat \" form, on a projecting crag, commanding a most beautiful prospect, is termed \" BarnhiU's bed. This Barnhill is said to have been a robber, and an outlaw. \" There are remains of a strong tower beneath the rocks, where he is supposed \u00ab to have dwelt, and from which he is said to have derived his name.\" Line 37.\u2014 But Heaven forbade.] Lord Minto died suddenly, on the 21st of June 1814, at Stevenage, about a month after his return to England from India. He was' on his way to Scotland, and had left London in a bad state of health.

Previous to this period, the political horizon of India was over clouded with gloom. We had to contend with an enemy whose fortitude, perseverance, and activity were unlooked for : our armies had sustained repeated defeats, with the loss of some of our best commanders. Such was the disastrous issue of the first campaign till the month of January 1815; but in the subsequent military operations of the first and second campaigns, the towering genius of Sir David Ochterlony overcame every obstacle; carried him, as it were, with the wings of a mighty eagle, triumphantly through the war ; and crowned him with glory.
