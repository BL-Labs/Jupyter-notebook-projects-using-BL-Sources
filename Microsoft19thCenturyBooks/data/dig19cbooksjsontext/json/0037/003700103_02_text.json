PART SECOND. I. OF ARABIA, AND THE EMPIRE OF THE SARACENS, 1. The fall of the Western Empire of the Romans, and the final subjugation of Italy by the Lombards, is the \u00e6ra from which we date the commencement of modern history. The Eastern Empire of the Romans continued to exist for many ages after this period, still magnificent, though in a state of comparative weakness and degeneracy. Towards the end of the sixth century, a new dominion arose in the East, which was destined to produce a wonder ful change on a great portion of the globe. The Arabians, at this time a rude nation, living chiefly in independent tribes, who traced their descent from the patriarch Abraham, VOL. II. B"], [20, "9. PART II. MODERN HISTORY. [through Ishmael the son of Hagar,] professed a mixed religion, compounded of Judaism and Idolatry. Mecca, their holy city, arose to eminence from the donations of pilgrims to its temple, in which was reposited a black stone, an object of high veneration. Mahomet was born at Mecca, A. D. 57 1. [Though descended from a family which had produced many chieftains, and belonging to the tribe of Koreish, the most noble in Arabia, he was born in low circum stances, and had no education ; but his natural talents being above the ordinary stamp,] he sought to raise himself to celebrity, by feigning a divine mission to propagate a new religion for the salvation of mankind. [The Jewish expect ations of a Messiah yet to come, and the Chris tian promise of a Comforter, afforded him grounds sufficient to set out upon the pretension of being the person intended to restore happiness to all the nations of the earth, while an Arabian predic tion, in favor of such pretensions, seemed to con fine it to some member of the tribe of Koreish, to which Mahomet, as has been shown, particularly belonged.] He accordingly retired to the desert, and pretended to hold conferences with the angel Gabriel, who [it was asserted] de livered to him from time to time portions of a"], [21, "3 SECT. 1. MODERN HISTORY. sacred book, or Coran, containing revelations of \u25a0\u2022the will of the Supreme Being, and of the doc trines which he required his Prophet to commu nicate to the world. [It is certainly remarkable, that this book should be written ' in a style so peculiar as to have become a model of the Arabic tongue, since, on the eloquence of the writing, Mahomet in a great measure rested the truth of his mission, contrasting the purity of the style with the deficiency of his own education, and in want of other credentials, insisting upon it as carrying with it all the weight and importance of an actual and true miracle. Perhaps the secret is to be found in the circumstances of the tribe to which he belonged, the dialect of the Koreish being particularly pure, and free from provincial corruptions.] 2. This religion, while it adopted in part the morality of Christianity, retained many of the rites of Judaism, and some of the Arabian super stitions, as the pilgrimage to Mecca ; but owed to a certain spirit of Asiatic voluptuousness its chief recommendation to its votaries. The Coran taught the belief of one God, whose will and power were constantly exerted towards the happiness of his creatures ; that the duty of man was to love his neighbours, assist the poor, b %"], [22, "4 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. protect the injured, to be humane to inferior animals, and to pray seven times a-day ; [gam- ing and usury were particularly proscribed.] The pious Mussulman [polygamy being already sanctioned by the customs of Arabia] was allowed to have four wives, and as many con- cubines as he chose ; and [with a view to a re- surrection and a future life, which were amongst the original tenets of his countrymen,] the pleasures of love were promised as the supreme joys of paradise, [intermingled with such other particular indulgences and luxuries, as were directly opposed to the inconveniences and de- privations of an Arabian climate ; gardens irri- gated by rivers, and groves of perpetual shade.] To revive the impression of these laws, which God [it was pretended] had engraven originally in the hearts of men, he had sent from time to time his prophets upon earth, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, and Mahomet*; the last the greatest, to whom all the world should owe its conversion to the true religion. By producing the Coran in detached parcels, Mahomet had it in his power to solve all objections by new revelations ; [while his adoption of the Oriental tenet of pre destination, to its fullest extent, took from his followers the fear of death, in all attempts to propagate his religion by the sword.]"], [23, "SECT. 1. 5 MODERN HISTORY. 3. Dissensions and popular tumults between the believers and infidels caused the banishment of Mahomet from Mecca. His flight, called the Hegyra, (A.D. 622,) is the \u00e6ra of his glory. He betook himself to Medina, was joined by the brave Omar, and, propagating his doctrines with great success, marched with his followers in arms, and took the city of Mecca. In a few years, he subdued all Arabia ; and then attack ing Syria, won several of the Roman cities. In the midst of his victories he died at the age of sixty-one, A.D. 632. He had nominated Ali, his son-in-law, his successor, but [through the intrigues of Ayesha, one of the prophet's widows, and by gaining the army over to his interest,] Abubeker, his father-in-law, secured the suc cession. 4. Abubeker united and published the books of the Coran, and prosecuted the conquests of Mahomet. He defeated the army of Heraclius, [the eastern Emperor,] took Jerusalem, and subjected all between Mount Libanus and the Mediterranean. On his death, Omar was elected to the Caliphate, [the successors of the prophet in things spiritual and temporal being denomin ated Caliphs,'] and in one campaign deprived the Greek empire of Syria, Ph\u0153nicia, [including b 3"], [24, "6 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. Palestine,] Mesopotamia, and Chald\u00e6a. In the next, he subdued to the Mussulman dominion and religion the whole empire of Persia. His generals at the same time conquered Egypt, Libya, and Numidia. 5. Otman, the successor of Omar, added to the dominion of the Caliphs Bactriana, and part of Tartary, and ravaged Rhodes and the Greek islands. His successor was Ali, the son-in-law of Mahomet, a name to this day revered by the Mahometans. He transferred the seat of the Caliphate from Mecca to Couffa, whence it was afterwards removed [first to Damascus and finally] to Bagdat. His reign was glorious, but only of five years' duration. In the space of half a century from the beginning of the con quests of Mahomet, the Saracens raised an empire more extensive than what remained of the Roman. Nineteen Caliphs of the race of Omar (Ommiades) had reigned in succession, [when Marwan II. was dethroned by Abu Abbas Abdallah, and his whole race destroyed, with the single exception of the celebrated Abdalrahman, whose exploits and settlement in Spain will ap pear hereafter.] With Abu Abbas began the dynasty of the Abassid\u00e6, descended by the male line from Mahomet. Almanzor, second Caliph of"], [25, "SECT. 1. MODERN HISTORY. 7 this race, removed the seat of empire to Bagdat, 776, and introduced learning and the culture of the sciences, which his successors continued to promote with equal zeal and liberality. Haroun Alraschid, [grandson of Almanzor,] who flou rished in the beginning of the ninth century, [and was twenty-three years Caliph,] is cele brated as a second Augustus. The sciences chiefly cultivated by the Arabians were, Medi cine, [Chemistry, Botany,] Geometry, and Astro nomy, [borrowed in a great degree from the Greeks, whose books they imperfectly trans lated. Their Astronomy was a good deal mixed up with Astrology, though their knowledge of the stars was founded on pretty correct observ ations. In Geography we stand indebted to Abulfeda for much original information.] They improved the Oriental Poetry, by adding re gularity to its fancy and luxuriancy of imagery. [Their proverbs and romances are in credit to this day ; of which latter, the thousand and one nights is a strong instance, and which are to be referred to the times of Haroun Alraschid, the hero, in fact, of those entertaining stories, the illustrious contemporary and ally of Charle magne.] B 4"], [26, "8 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. II. MONARCHY OF THE FRANKS. 1. The Franks were originally those tribes of Germans who inhabited the districts lying on the Lower Rhine and Weser, and who, in the time of Tacitus, passed under the names of Chauci, Cherusci, Catti, Sicambri, &c. They assumed or received the appellation of Franks, or freemen, from their temporary union to resist the dominion of the Romans, [being first so called by the historians of the third century.] Legendary chronicles record a Pharamond and a Meroveus ; the latter tlie head of the first race of the kings of France termed the Merovingian ; but the authentic history of the Franks com mences only with his grandson Clovis, who began to reign in the year 4S1. While only in the twentieth year of his age, Clovis achieved the conquest of Gaul, by the defeat of Syagrius the Roman Governor [at Soissons] ; and mar rying Clotilda, daughter of Chilperic, King of Burgundy, soon added that province to his dominions, by dethroning his father-in-law. He"], [27, "SECT. 2. 9 MODERN HISTORY. was converted by Clotilda j and the Franks, till then idolaters, became Christians, after their Sovereign's example. The Visigoths were masters at this time of Aquitaine, the country between the Rhone and Loire, [and though, like the Franks, they also had been converted to Christianity, yet, having embraced the Arian tenets, they were opposed to the principles of Clotilda, who had deserted her countrymen, and embraced the Roman faith.] The intemperate zeal of Clovis prompted the extirpation of these heretics, who retreated across the Pyrenees into Spain, and the province of Aquitaine became part of the kingdom of the Franks. They did not, however, long retain it ; for Theodoric the Great, [though himself an Arian, and married to the sister of Clovis, opposed him in this attempt, and] defeating him in the battle of Aries, added Aquitaine to his own dominions. [The daughter of Theodoric, indeed, had married the King of the Visigoths, so that he fought for the interests of his grandsons.] Clovis died, A.D. 511. 2. His four sons, [probably upon the prin ciple of the civil law, which in cases of private property had established that rule and mode of succession,] divided the monarchy, and were perpetually at war with each other. A series of"], [28, "10 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. weak and wicked princes succeeded, and Gaul for some as:es was characterised under its Frank sovereigns by more than ancient barbarism. On the death of Dagobert II., (A. D. 715,) who left two infant sons, the government, during their minority, fell into the hands of their chief officers, termed Mayors of the Palace ; and these ambitious men founded a new power, which for some generations held the Frank sovereigns in absolute subjection, and left them little more than the title of King. [In their own names they assumed the power of pardoning offences, of distributing offices, of filling vacant feofs, and of transmitting their honours and possessions to their descendants. In alfthese things, however, they were obliged to proceed with much caution, having in the other great feudatories not only equals but rivals.] Austrasia and Neustria, the two great divisions of the Frank monarchy, [the former including the territories bordering on the Rhine, the latter the more central parts of modern France,] were nominally governed by Thierry, but in reality by Pepin Heristel, Mayor of the Palace, who, restricting his Sovereign to a small domain, ruled France for thirty years with great wisdom and good policy. His son, Charles Martel, succeeded to his power, and, under a"], [29, "SECT. 2. MODERN HISTORY. 11 similar title, governed 'for twenty-six years, with equal ability and success. He was victorious over all his domestic foes, his arms kept in awe the surrounding nations, and he delivered France from the ravages of the Saracens, [who at that time were making great progress in the parts bor dering upon Spain, and] whom he entirely de feated, between Tours and Poictiers, A. D. 7-32, [thereby, in all likelihood, securing Lombardy, Italy, and eventually, perhaps, the eastern empire, from the preponderance of the Moslems; \u2014 such a line of conquest, according to their own writers, having been contemplated by the Arabian com mander.] 3. Charles Mar tel bequeathed the govern ment of France, as an undisputed inheritance, to his two sons, Pepin le Brief, and Carloman, who governed, under the same title of Mayor, the one Austrasia, and the other Neustria and Burgundy. On the resignation of Carloman, Pepin succeeded to the sole administration ; and, ambitious of adding the title of King to the power which he already enjoyed, proposed the question to Pope Zachary, whether he or his Sovereign Childeric was most worthy of the throne ? Zachary, who had his own interest in view, decided [that he who had the power ought"], [30, "12 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. to bear the name, and] that Pepin therefore had a right to add the title of King to the office ; and [upon this decision] Childeric was [speedily re moved and] confined to a monastery for life. With him ended the first or Merovingian race of the Kings of France, A. D. 7-51. 4. Pepin recompensed the service done him by the Pope, by turning his arms against the Lombards; [of whom the Roman Pontiff stood much in dread ;] and, stripping them of the ex archate of Ravenna, he made a donation of that and other considerable territories to the Holy See, which were the first, as is alleged, of its temporal possessions\"; [for the pretended gift of Constantine is now generally held to be a fable.] Conscious of his defective title, it was the principal object of Pepin le Brief to conciliate the affections of the people whom he governed. The legislative power among the Franks was vested in the people assembled in their Champs de Mars. Under the Merovingian race the re gal authority had sunk to nothing, while the power of the nobles had attained to an inor dinate extent. Pepin found it his best policy to acknowledge and ratify those rights, which he could not without danger have invaded ; and thus, under the character of guardian of the"], [31, "SECT. 3. 13 MODERN HISTORY. powers of all the orders of the state, he exalted the regal office to its proper elevation, and founded it on the securest basis ; [having, in order to render his person sacred and inviolable, first introduced the ceremony of anointing, when in the cathedral of Soissons he was crowned and consecrated by the celebrated St. Boniface.] On his death-bed he called a council of the gran dees, and obtained their consent to a division of his kingdom between his two sons, Charles and Carloman. He died A. D. 768, at the age of fifty-three, after a reign of seventeen years from the death of Childeric III., and an administration of twenty-seven from the death of Charles Martel. III. REFLECTIONS ON THE STATE OF FRANCE DUR- ING THE MEROVINGIAN RACE OF ITS KINGS. ORIGIN OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM. 1. The manners of the Franks were similar to those of the other Germanic nations de scribed by Tacitus. Though under the com mand of a chief or king, their government was"], [32, "14 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. extremely democratical, and they acknowledged no other than a military subordination. [The crown was disposed of by election in all cases, yet not without some regard to hereditary claims on the part of the family of the deceased monarch. \" Reges \u2014 electione pariter et suc cession soliti sunt procreari.\"~\\ The legislative authority resided in the General Assembly, or Champ de Mars, held annually on the 1st day of March ; a council in which the King had but a single suffrage, equally with the meanest sol dier. But when in arms against the enemy, his power was absolute in enforcing military disci pline. 2. After the establishment of the Franks in Gaul, some changes took place from their new situation. They reduced the Gauls to absolute subjection ; yet they left many in possession of their lands, because the new country was too large for its conquerors. They left them like wise in the use of their existing laws, which were those of the Roman Theodosian code, while they themselves were governed by the Salique and Ripuarian laws, ancient institutions in ob servance among the Franks before they left their original seats in Germany. Hence arose that extraordinary diversity of local laws and usages"], [33, "SECT. 3. MODERN HISTORY. 15 in the kingdom of France, which, continuing down to modern times, have given occasion to numberless inconveniences. 3. The ancient Germans had the highest veneration for their priests or Druids. It was natural that the Franks, after their conversion to Christianity, should have the same reverence for their bishops, to whom accordingly they al lowed the first rank in the national assembly. These bishops were generally chosen from among the native Gauls; for, \"having adopted from this nation their new religion, it was na tural that their priests should be chosen from the same people. The influence of the clergy contributed much to ameliorate the condition of the conquered Gauls, and to humanise their conquerors ; [but not without a sad mixture of superstition and great discouragement of learn ing in the laity]. In a short space of time the two nations were thoroughly incorporated. 4. At this period a new system of policy is visible among this united people, which by de grees extended itself over most of the nations of Europe, \u2014 the Feudal System. By this expression is properly meant that tenure or condition on which the proprietors of land held their possessions, viz. an obligation to per-"], [34, "16 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. form military service, whenever required by the chief or overlord to whom they owed allegiance. Many modern writers [particularly among the French] attribute the origin of this institution or policy to the Kings of the Franks, who, after the conquest of Gaul, are supposed to have di vided the lands among their followers, on this condition of military service. But this notion is attended with insurmountable difficulties. For, in the first place, it proceeds on this false idea, that the conquered lands belonged in property to the King, and that he had the right of be stowing them in gifts, or dividing them among his followers ; whereas it is a certain fact, that, among the Franks, the partition of conquered lands was made by lot, as was the division even of the spoil or booty taken in battle ; and that the King's share, though doubtless a larger por tion than that of his captains, was likewise assigned him by lot. Secondly, if we should suppose the King to have made those gifts to his captains out of his own domain, the creation of a very few beneficia would have rendered him a poorer man than his subjects. We must therefore have recourse to another supposition for the origin of the fiefs ; and we shall find that"], [35, "SECT. 3. 17 MODERN HISTORY. it is to be traced to a source much more remote than the conquest of Gaul by the Franks. 5. [Not to insist in this place on the traces of feudalism to be found in the oldest records of India,] among all barbarous nations, with whom war is the chief occupation, we remark a strict subordination of the members of a tribe to their chief or leader. It was observed by C\u00e6sar as peculiarly strong among the Gaulish nations, and as subsisting not only between the soldiers and their commander, but between the inferior towns or villages and the canton or province to which they belonged. In peace, every man cultivated his land, free of all taxation, and subject to no other burden than that of military service when required by his chief. When the province was at war, each village, though taxed to furnish only a certain number of soldiers, was bound to send, on the day appointed for a ge neral muster, all its males capable of bearing arms, and from these its rated number was se lected by the chief of the province. This cti entela subsisted among the Franks as well as among the Gauls. It subsisted among the Ro mans, who, in order to secure their distant con quests, were obliged to maintain fixed garrisons on their frontiers, to check the inroads of the VOL. II. c"], [36, "18 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Barbarian nations. To each officer in these garrisons it was customary to assign a portion of land as the pledge and pay of his service. These gifts were termed beneficia, and their proprietors beneficiarii, Plin. Ep. lib. 10. ep. 32. The bene- Jicia were at first granted only for life : Alex- ander Severus allowed them to descend to heirs, on the like condition of military service. 6. When Gaul was over-run by the Franks, a great part of the lands was possessed on this tenure by the Roman soldiery, as the rest was by the native Gauls. The conquerors, accus tomed to the same policy, would naturally adopt it in the partition of their new conquests ; each man, on receiving his share, becoming bound to military service, as a condition necessarily annexed to territorial property. With respect to those Gauls who retained their possessions, [and who may be regarded as the original allo dial proprietors,] no other change was necessary than to exact the same obligation of military vassalage to their new conquerors, that they had rendered to their former masters the Emperors, and, before the Roman conquest, to their native chiefs, [or to the community ; for even the allo dial proprietors were bound by what historians call the trinodis necessitas, namely, to serve in"], [37, "SECT. 3. 19 MODERN HISTORY. the wars when duly summoned ; to maintain the public bridges ; and to keep in repair fortified places.] Thus no other change took place than that of the overlord. The system was the same which had prevailed for ages. 7- But these beneficia, or fiefs, were personal grants, revocable by the Sovereign or overlord, and reverting to him on the death of the vassal. The weakness of the Frank Kings of the Merovin gian race, [and that partition of the sovereignty which, by throwing them into a state of continual competition, rendered it -necessary for them to attach as many followers as they could,] im boldened the possessors of fiefs to aspire at inde pendence and security of property. In a con vention held at Andeli in 587, to treat of peace between Gontran and Childebert II., the nobles obliged these princes to renounce the right of revoking their benefices, which henceforward passed by inheritance to their eldest male issue ; [a change which seems to have suggested the security of particular charters in all subsequent beneficiary grants, prescribing terms and condi tions, variable in their nature, and so different often the one from the other, that there could hardly be found two seignories in the whole c 2"], [38, "20 PART ir. MODERN HISTORY. kingdom, which were governed in every point of view by the same law.] 8. It was a necessary consequence of a fief be coming perpetual and hereditary, that it should be capable of subinfeudation ; and that the vas sal himself, holding his land of the Sovereign by the tenure of military service, should be en abled to create a train of inferior vassals, by giving to them portions of his estate to be held [under similar charters, and] on the same condi tions, of following his standard in battle, ren dering him homage as their lord, and paying, as the symbol of their subjection, a small annual present, either of money, or the fruits of their lands. Thus, in a little time, the whole terri tory in the feudal kingdoms was either held im mediately and in capite of the Sovereign himself, or mediately by inferior vassals of the tenants in capite. 9. It was natural, that in those disorderly times, when the authority of government and the obligation of general laws were extremely weak, the superior or overlord should acquire a civil and criminal jurisdiction over his vassals. [Such a state of things seems, indeed, to have subsisted prior to, or independently of, the feudal times properly so called, all such rights having been"], [39, "SECT. 3. 21 MODERN HISTORY. possessed allodially, by the great proprietors of land long before the name of the feudal law was known in Europe.] The Comites, to whom, as the chief magistrates of police, the administra tion of justice belonged of right, paid little atten tion to the duties of their office, and shamefully abused their powers. The inferior classes na turally chose, instead of seeking justice through this corrupted channel, to submit their law-suits to the arbitration of their overlord ; and this jurisdiction, conferred at first by the acquiescence of parties, came at length to be regarded as founded on strict right. Hence arose a per petual contest of jurisdiction between the greater barons in their own territories and the esta blished j udicatories ; a natural cause of that ex treme anarchy and disorder which prevailed in France during the greater part of the Mero vingian period, and which sunk the regal au thority to the lowest pitch of abasement. [For the Comites, whose power and authority were dis puted and resisted by the greater feudatories, were servants of the crown. In course of time they themselves shook off their dependence, be stowing in their own names the royal benefices. 10. In such a state of things, it was impossible to avoid taking some steps to reduce the princi- c 3"], [40, "22 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. pies of the feudal polity into one regular system of jurisprudence, or at least of so ascertaining the several customs or laws prevailing in dif ferent parts, as might enable all persons to know and understand the particular rules and regula tions to which they might be personally or lo cally subject.

In a government, of which every part was at variance with the rest, it is not surprising that a new power should arise, which, in able hands, should be capable of enslaving and bringing the wrhole under subjection. The Mayor of the Pa lace, or first officer of the household, [as has been before intimated,] gradually usurped, under a series of weak princes, the whole powers of the sovereign. This office, from a personal dignity, became hereditary in the family of Pepin He ristel; and his grandson, Pepin le Brief, re moving from the throne those phantoms of the Merovingian race, assumed, by the authority of a papal decree, the title of King, and reigned for seventeen years with dignity and success,"], [41, "SECT. 4. 23 MODERN HISTORY. the founder of the second race of the French monarchs, known by the name'of the Carlovin gian. [See the preceding section.] IV. CHARLEMAGNE. THE NEW EMPIRE OF THE WEST. 1. Pepin le Brief, with the consent of his nobles, divided, on his death-bed, the kingdom of France between his sons, Charles and Carlo man, A. D. 768. The latter dying a few years after his father, Charles succeeded to the undi vided sovereignty. In the course of a reign of forty-five years, Charlemagne (for so he was de servedly styled) extended the limits of his em pire beyond the Danube ; subdued Dacia, Dal matia, and Istria ; conquered and subjected all the barbarous tribes to the banks of the Vistula, made himself master of a great portion of Italy, and successfully encountered the arms of the Sa racens, the Huns, the Bulgarians, and the Saxons. His war with the Saxons was of thirty years' dur ation, and their final conquest was not achieved without an inhuman waste of blood, [[through c 4"], [42, "24 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. what has been considered a mistaken zeal for the propagation of Christianity by measures which that religion cannot be said to sanction or approve. But other views have been taken of the subject, and a conjecture thrown out, that Charlemagne did not use violence merely to make the Saxons Christians, but that having engaged and subdued them, he caused or obliged them, quite as much on political as religious grounds, to profess Christianity, that they might become peace able subjects. It is exceedingly certain, that in building churches, and upholding the in fluence of the clergy, he acted upon this princi ple. \" Carolus magnus,\" says Malmsbury, \" pro contundendd gentium illarum ferocid omnes pene terras ecclesiis contulerat, consilio sissime perpendens nolle sacri ordinis homines, tarn facile quam laicos,fidelitatem domini regi cere.\"~\\ At the request of the Pope, and to dis charge the obligation of his father Pepin to the Holy See, Charlemagne, though allied by mar riage to Desiderius, King of the Lombards, dis possessed that prince of all his dominions, and put a final period to the Lombard dominion in Italy, A. D. 774. 2. He made his entry into Rome at the fes tival of Easter, was there crowned King of France and of the Lombards, and was, by Pope"], [43, "SECT. 4. MODERN HISTORY. 25 Adrian I., invested with the right of ratifying the election of the Popes. [A right, however, said to have been previously enjoyed and exercised by the Ostrogoths and Exarchs of Ravenna, in virtue of their being Patricians. At this period, at all events, his authority at Rome was very considerable ; all public affairs were conducted by his orders ; the money bore his impression ; the public acts the date of the year of his reign, \" Imperante Domino nostro Carolo;\" and appeals lay from the sentences of the Pope to the King's officers. But they were the privileges of the Pa triciate, still in subordination to the Grecian Em peror. His father had been made a Patrician, but never exercised its rights.] Irene, Empress of the East, sought to ally herself with Char lemagne, by the marriage of her son Constantine to the daughter of this monarch ; but her subse quent inhuman conduct, in putting Constantine to death, gave ground to suspect the sincerity of her desire for that alliance. 3. In the last visit of Charlemagne to Italy, he was [in rather a remarkable manner, on the festival of the nativity,] consecrated Emperor of the West by the hands of Pope Leo III. [He pretended that he had been surprised into this measure, as his own secretary, historian, and son-"], [44, "26 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. in-law, Eginhart, has affirmed; but it seems scarcely possible, and has, indeed, been contra- dicted by other writers on good grounds.] It is probable, that had he chosen Rome for his residence and seat of government, and at his death transmitted to his successor an undivided dominion, that great but fallen empire might have once more been restored to lustre and respect; but Charlemagne had no fixed ca- pital, [and is even supposed to have particu- larly avoided settling at Rome in deference to the Pope.] He divided, even in his lifetime, his dominions among his children, A. D. 806 ; [a measure more excusable, perhaps, in him than in others, owing to the immense extent of his dominions, embracing the upper part of Spain, the three Gauls, as they were called, Germany between the Rhine and the Oder, the greatest part of the Austrian possessions south of the Danube, the Balearic isles, and Italy, from the Alps to Beneventum, besides tributary countries, which, as the price of his alliance and protection, guarded his frontiers as a sort of intermediate states. It seems probable, however, that neither Charlemagne, nor his successors, intended by these partitions any actual dismemberment of the empire, since they endeavoured to secure"], [45, "SECT. 4. 27 MODERN HISTORY. that submission of the younger branches, to whomsoever might be invested with the imperial dignity. This, however, only increased the causes and occasions of jealousy and dissension.] 4. The economy of government and the do mestic administration of Charlemagne merit at tention. Pepin le Brief had introduced the sys tem of annual assemblies or parliaments, held at first in March, and afterwards in May, where the chief estates of clergy and nobles were called to deliberate on the public affairs, and the wants of the people. Charlemagne ap pointed the assemblies to be held twice in the year, in spring and in autumn. In the lat ter all affairs were prepared and digested; in the former was transacted the business of le gislation ; and of this assembly he made the people a party, by admitting from each pro vince or district twelve deputies or represent atives. The assembly now consisted of three estates, who each formed a separate chamber, which discussed apart the concerns of its own order, and afterwards united to communicate their resolutions, or to deliberate on their com- mon interests. The Sovereign was never present, unless when called to ratify the decrees of the assembly."], [46, "28 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. 5. Charlemagne divided the empire into pro vinces, and these into districts, each compre hending a certain number of counties. The districts were governed by royal envoys, [or com missaries, missi dominici, or regii, as they were called,] chosen [by the Emperor himself] from the clergy and nobles, and bound to an exact visitation of their territories every three months. These envoys held yearly conventions, at which were present the higher clergy and barons, to discuss the affairs of the district, examine the conduct of its magistrates, and redress the griev ances of individuals. At the general assembly or Champ de Mai, the royal envoys made their report to the Sovereign and States ; and thus the public attention was constantly directed to all the concerns of the empire. [He manifested a becoming care for the maintenance of religion in his dominions, by correcting several abuses, the use of images or paintings among others, and modifying what could not without violence to the feelings of his people be wholly done away ; as the privilege of asylum, the period for taking the monastic vows, and the custom of satisfying debts or taxes by the voluntary surrender of per sonal liberty.] 6. The private character of Charlemagne was"], [47, "SECT. 4. MODERN HISTORY. 29 most amiable and respectable. His secretary, Eginhart, has painted his domestic life in beau tiful and simple colouring. The economy of his family, when the daughters of the Emperor were assiduously employed in spinning and housewifery, and the sons trained by their father in the practice of all manly exercises, is charac teristic of an age of great simplicity. This illustrious man died A. D. 814, in the seventy second year of his age. Contemporary with him was Haroun Alraschid, Caliph of the Sara cens, equally celebrated for his conquests, ex cellent policy, and the Avisdom and humanity of his government. [See Sect. I.] 7. Of all the lawful sons of Charlemagne, Lewis the Debonnaire was the only one who survived him, and who, therefore, succeeded without dispute to the imperial dominions, ex cepting Italy, which the Emperor had settled on Bernard, his grandson by Pepin, his second son."], [48, "30 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. V. MANNERS, GOVERNMENT, AND CUSTOMS OF THE AGE OF CHARLEMAGNE. 1. In establishing the provincial conventions under the royal envoys, Charlemagne did not entirely abolish the authority of the ancient chief magistrates, the Dukes and Counts. They con tinued to command the troops of the province, and to make the levies in stated numbers from each district. Cavalry was not numerous in the imperial armies, twelve farms being taxed to furnish only one horseman with his armour and accoutrements. [Those soldiers who made use of arrows were obliged to have twelve in their quivers.] The province supplied six months' provisions to its complement of men, and the King maintained them during the rest of the campaign. 2. The engines for the attack and defence of towns were, as in former times, the ram, the balista, catapulta, testudo, &c. Charlemagne had his ships of war stationed in the mouths of"], [49, "SECT. 5. 31 MODERN HISTORY. all the large rivers. [Before his time they were unknown amongst the barbarians, and after him they were a long time without them, from which the kingdom suffered materially.] He bestowed great attention on commerce. The merchants of Italy and the south of France, [in consequence of the friendship and treaties sub sisting between Charlemagne and the Caliph Haroun Alraschid,] traded to the Levant, and exchanged the commodities of Europe and Asia. Venice and Genoa were rising into commercial opulence ; and the manufactures of wool, of glass, and iron, were successfully cultivated in many of the principal towns in the south of Europe, [particularly Lyons, Aries, Tours, Ravenna, and Rome. Linen was very un common ; the wrant of which may probably have been the occasion, in a great degree, of the cutaneous disorders with which they appear to have been inflicted, particularly the leprosy, for which there were many lazarettos or hospitals established.] 3. The value of money was nearly the same as in the Roman empire in the age of Constan tine the Great. The numerary livre, in the age of Charlemagne, was supposed to be a pound of silver, in value about \u00a33 sterling of English"], [50, "32 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. money. At present the livre is worth lOid. English. Hence we ought to be cautious in forming our estimate of ancient money from its name ; and from the want of this caution have arisen the most erroneous ideas of the commerce, riches, and strength of the ancient kingdoms. 4. The Capitularia of Charlemagne, compiled into a body A.D. 827, were recovered from oblivion in 1531 and 1545. They present many circumstances illustrative of the manners of the times. Unless in great cities, there were no inns : the laws obliged every man to give ac commodation to travellers ; [and the monasteries and religious houses were particularly expected to exercise hospitality in this way ; and they did so.] The chief towns were built of wood, and even the walls were of that material. The state of the mechanic arts was very low in Europe : the Saracens had brought them to greater per fection. Painting and sculpture were only pre served from absolute extinction by the existing remains of ancient art. Charlemagne appears to have been anxious for the improvement of music ; and the Italians are said to have instructed his French performers in the art of playing on the organ. Architecture was studied and success-"], [51, "SECT. 5. 33 MODERN HISTORY. fully cultivated in that style termed the Gothic, [derived, perhaps, from the Arabians,] which admits of great beauty, elegance, and magnifi cence. The composition of Mosaic appears to have been an invention of those ages. [Charle magne introduced it from Rome and Ravenna as one of the chief ornaments of the palaces he built at Ingelheim, Nimeguen, and Aix-la-Chapelle.] 5. The knowledge of letters was extremely low, and confined to a few of the ecclesiastics : but Charlemagne gave the utmost encourage ment to literature and the sciences, [founding and establishing schools in abbeys and cathe drals, and] inviting into his dominions of France men eminent in those departments from Italy, and from the Britannic isles, which, in those dark ages, preserved more of the light of learning than any of the western kingdoms. \" Neque enim si \" lenda laus Britanni\u00e6, Scoti\u0153, et Hiberni\u00e6, \" qu\u0153 studio liber alium artium eo tempore ante \" cellebant reliquis occidentalibus regnis ; et cura \" pr\u00e6sertim monachorum, qui lit er arum gloriam, \" alibi out languentem aut depressam, in Us re \" gionibus impigre suscitarent atque tuebantur.\" Murat.

MODERN HISTORY. magne, was prevailed upon by the latter to remain at his court, and become his preceptor. A French writer acknowledges that to Alcuin his country was indebted for all the polite learning it had to boast of, in that and the following ages.] The scarcity of books in those times, and the nature of their subjects, legends, lives of the saints, &c, evince the narrow diffusion of literature. 6. The pecuniary fines for homicide, the ordeal or judgment of God, and judicial combat, were striking peculiarities in the laws and manners of the northern nations, and particularly of the Franks. With this warlike but barbarous people, revenge was esteemed honourable and merito rious, [and their manners gave but too much scope to this passion, in the excesses of the table, their propensity to gaming, and the disposition to raillery for which they were notorious.] The high-spirited warrior chastised or vindicated with his own hand the injuries he had received or inflicted. The magistrate interfered, not to punish, but to reconcile, and was satisfied if he could persuade the aggressor to pay, and the injured party to accept, the moderate fine which was imposed as the price of blood ; and of which the measure was estimated according to the"], [53, "SECT. 5. MODERN HISTORY. 35 rank, the sex, and the country of the person slain. [The law in this case, through a sad oversight, legalising, as it were, the very worst of crimes, by establishing a most inadequate and easy satisfaction.] But increasing civilisation abolished those barbarous distinctions. We have remarked the equal severity of the laws of the Visigoths, both in the crime of murder and robbery; and even among the Franks, in the age of Charlemagne, deliberate murder was punished with death. 7. By their ancient laws, a party accused of any crime was allowed to produce compurgators, or a certain number of witnesses, according to the measure of the offence; and if these declared upon oath their belief of his innocence, it was held a sufficient exculpation. Seventy two com- purgators were required to acquit a murderer or an incendiary. The flagrant perjuries occasioned by this absurd practice probably gave rise to the trial by ordeal, which was termed, as it was believed to be, the judgment of God. The criminal was ordered, at the option of the judge, to prove his innocence or guilt, by the ordeal of cold water, of boiling water, or red-hot iron. He was tied hand and foot, and thrown into a pool, to sink or swim ; he was made to fetch d 2"], [54, "36 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. a ring from the bottom of a vessel of boiling water, or to walk barefooted over burning plough-shares ; and history records examples of those wonderful experiments having been under gone without injury or pain ; [but there is no saying to what extent connivance or artifice may have had their share in such cases ; for, as an acute writer has observed, there are many ways of deception, but none of becoming invulnerable ; and abject credulity is almost an excuse for im posture.] 8. Another peculiarity of the laws and man ners of the northern nations was judicial combat. Both in civil suits and in the trial of crimes, the party destitute of legal proofs might challenge his antagonist to mortal combat, and rest the cause upon its issue. This sanguinary and most iniquitous custom, which may be traced to this day in the practice of duelling, had the autho rity of law in the court of the Constable and Marshal, even in the last century, in France and England."], [55, "SECT. 6. 37 MODERN HISTORY. VI. RETROSPECTIVE VIEW OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE CHURCH PRECEDING THE AGE OF CHARLE- MAGNE. 1. The Arian and Pelagian heresies divided the Christian church for many ages. In the fourth century, Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, maintained the separate and inferior nature of the second Person of the Trinity, regarding Christ as the noblest of created beings, through whose agency the Creator had formed the universe. His doctrine was condemned in the Council of Nice, held by Constantine A. D. 325, who afterwards became a convert to his opinions. These for many centuries had an extensive in fluence, and produced the sects of theEunomians, Semi-Arians, Eusebians, &c. 2. In the beginning of the fifth century, Pelagius and C\u00e6lestius, the former a native of Britain, the latter of Ireland, denied the doctrine of original sin, and the necessity of Divine grace to enlighten the understanding, and purify the heart ; and maintained the sufficiency of man's d 3"], [56, "38 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. natural powers for the attainment of the highest degrees of piety and virtue. These tenets were ably combated by St. Augustine, and condemned by an ecclesiastical council, but have ever con tinued to find many supporters. .3. The most obstinate source of controversy in those ages was regarding the worship of images ; a practice which, though at first op posed by the clergy, was afterwards, from in terested motives, countenanced and vindicated by them. It was, however, long a subject of division in the church. The Emperor Leo the Isaurian, A.D. 7*27> [prompted, as it has been suggested, by a desire of averting the enmity of the Mahometans, who persecuted the Christians of the East on this very account,] attempted to suppress this idolatry, by the destruction of every statue and picture found in the churches, and by punishment of their worshippers ; but this intemperate zeal rather increased than repressed the superstition. His son Constantine Copro nymus, with wiser policy, satisfied himself with procuring its condemnation by the church, [but the efforts of Leo, (Iconoclastes as he was called,) from the course he took, embroiled him so with the Roman Pontiff, Gregory the Third, as to in duce the latter to erase the Emperor's name from"], [57, "SECT. 6. MODERN HISTORY. 39 the Dyptics, and led the way to the union soon after effected between the Popes and the French court, which established the temporal power of the former, and in time raised them in a most extraordinary manner above all ecclesiastical, regal, and even imperial competitors.] 4. From the doctrines of the Platonic and Stoic philosophy, which recommended the puri fication of the soul, by redeeming it from its subjection to the senses, arose the system of penances, mortification, religious sequestration, and monachism. After Constantine had put an end to the persecution of the Christians, many conceived it a duty to procure for themselves voluntary grievances and sufferings. They re tired into caves and hermitages, and there prac tised the most rigorous mortifications of the flesh, by fasting, scourging, vigils, &c. This phrenzy first showed itself in Egypt in the fourth century, whence it spread all over the East, a great part of Africa, and within the limits of the bishopric of Rome. In the time of Theodosius, these devotees began to form communities or c\u0153nobia, each associate binding himself by oath to observe the rules of his order. St. Benedict introduced monachism into Italy under the reign of Totila ; and his order, the Benedictine, soon became d 4"], [58, "40 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. extremely numerous, and most opulent, from the many rich donations made by the devout and charitable, who conceived they profited by their prayers. Benedict sent colonies into Sicily and France, whence they soon spread over all Europe. 5. In the East, the monachi solitarii were first incorporated into c\u0153nobia by St. Basil, Bishop of C\u00e6sarea, in the middle of the fourth century; and, some time before that period, the first monasteries for women were founded in Egypt by the sister of St. Pacomo. From these, in the following age, sprung a variety of orders, under different rules. The rule of the Canons Regular was framed after the model of the apostolic life. The Mendicants, to chastity, obedience, and poverty, added the obligation of begging alms. The military religious orders were unknown till the age of the holy war. (See postea, Sect. XVII. \u00a7 3.) The monastic fraternities owed their re putation chiefly to the little literary knowledge which, in those ages of ignorance, they exclu sively possessed. 6. In the fifth century arose a set of fanatics termed Stylites, or pillar-saints, who passed their ives on the tops of pillars of various heights. Simeon of Syria lived thirty-seven years on a"], [59, "SECT. 6. MODERN HISTORY. 41 pillar sixty feet high, and died upon it. This phrenzy prevailed in the East for many centuries. 7. Auricular confession, which had been abo lished in the East in the fourth century, began to be in use in the West in the age of Charle magne, and has ever since prevailed in the Romish church. The canonisation of saints was for near twelve centuries practised by every bishop. Pope Alexander III., one of the most vicious of men, first claimed and assumed this right as the exclusive privilege of the successor of St. Peter. 8. The conquests of Charlemagne spread Christianity in the north of Europe; but all beyond the limits of his conquests was idolatrous. [Scandinavia and Denmark, in particular, the native seats of those Normans who afterwards fixed themselves in so many important countries of Christendom, were plunged in the grossest idolatry.] Britain and Ireland had received the light of Christianity at an earlier period, but it was afterwards extinguished, and again re vived under the Saxon heptarchy."], [60, "42 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. VII. EMPIRE OF THE WEST UNDER THE SUCCESSORS OF CHARLEMAGNE 1. The empire of Charlemagne, raised and supported solely by his abilities, fell to pieces under his weak posterity. [\" His sceptre,\" as an elegant writer has observed, \" was as the bow \" of Ulysses, which could not be drawn by any \" weaker hand.\"] Lewis (le Debonnaire), the only survivor of his lawful sons, was consecrated Emperor and King of the Franks at Aix-la-Cha pelle, A.D. 816. Among the first acts of his reign was the partition of his dominions among his children. To Pepin, his second son, he gave Aquitaine, the southern third of France ; to Lewis, the youngest, Bavaria ; and he associ ated his eldest son Lotharius with himself in the government of the rest. The three princes quarrelled among themselves, agreeing in no thing but in hostilities against their father. They made open war against him, supported by Pope Gregory IV. The pretence was, that the"], [61, "SECT. 7- 43 MODERN HISTORY. Emperor having a younger son, Charles, born to him after this partition of his states, wanted to provide this child likewise in a share, which could not be done but at the expense of his elder brothers. [The mother of Charles, the Empress Judith, rendered herself particularly obnoxious, by supporting these claims, and by her great influence with the Emperor. The other sons of Lewis accused her, besides, of a criminal in tercourse with Bernhard, Count of Barcelona.] Lewis was compelled to surrender himself a prisoner [together with the Empress and her son] to his rebellious children. [The Empress was sent to a prison in Lombardy, and Charles to a convent in the forest of Ardenne.] Lewis they confined for a year to a monastery ; [di vested of servants, and without any earthly con solation ;] till, on a new quarrel between Lewis the. younger and Pepin, Lotharius once more restored his father to the throne : but his spirits were broken, his health decayed, and he finished, soon after, an inglorious and turbulent reign, A.D. 840. [Those who had instigated and en couraged his unnatural children to deeds so base, particularly the Pope, were in the end treated with equal ingratitude.] 2. The dissensions of the brothers still con-"], [62, "44 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. tinued. Lotharius, now Emperor, and Pepin, his brother's son, having taken up arms against the two other sons of Lewis le Debonnaire, Lewis of Bavaria, and Charles the Bald, were defeated by them in the battle of Fontenai, where 100,000 are said to have fallen in the field. The church in those times was a prime organ of civil policy. A council of bishops immediately assembled, and solemnly deposed Lotharius; assuming, at the same time, an equal authority over his conquerors, whom they permitted to reign, on the express condition of submissive obedience to the supreme spiritual authority. Yet Lotharius, excommunicated and deposed, found means so to acccommodate matters with his brothers, that they agreed to a new partition of the empire. By the treaty of Verdun, A. D. 843, the western part of France, termed Neus tria and Aquitaine, was assigned to Charles the Bald ; Lotharius, with the title of Emperor, had the nominal sovereignty of Italy, and the real territory of Lorraine, Franche Compte, Pro vence, and the Lyonnois ; the share of Lewis was the kingdom of Germany. 3. Thus was Germany finally separated from the empire of the Franks, [though still for some time called Oriental France (Francia Orientalis.)"], [63, "SECT. 7- MODERN HISTORY. 45 Nor can the separation be said to be in all re- spects permanently established, before the acces- sion of Arnold, A. D. 888.] On the death of Lotharius, Charles the Bald assumed the empire, or, as is said, purchased it from Pope John VIIL, on the condition of holding it as vassal to the Holy See. This prince, after a weak and in- glorious reign, died by poison, A. D. 877' He was the first of the French monarchs who made dignities and titles hereditary. [He had also the credit of being considered as the first monarch of modern France, having introduced into his kingdom and court, the use of the lingua Ro- mano, or Romancic language, the mother of the present French, (instead of the Teutonic,) and Gallic instead of German manners ; so as to in- duce the continental writers to mark this period as the one in whichr to use their own terms, the Franks became French.] Under the distracted reigns of the Carlovingian kings, the nobles at tained great power, and commanded a formi dable vassalage. They strengthened themselves in their castles and fortresses, and bid defiance to the arm of government, while the country was ravaged and desolated by their feuds. 4. In the reign of Charles the Bald, France was plundered by the Normans, a new race of"], [64, "46 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Goths from Scandinavia, who had begun their depredations even in the time of Charlemagne, checked only in their progress by the terror of his arms, [and by the wise precautions he took to guard his coasts, which his successors neglected.] In A. D. 843, they sailed up the Seine, and plundered Rouen ; while another fleet entered the Loire, and laid waste the country in its vicinity, carrying, together with its spoils, men, women, and children, into cap- tivity. In the following year, they attacked the coasts of England, France, and Spain, but were repelled from the last by the good conduct and courage of its Mahometan rulers. In 845, they entered the Elbe, plundered Hamburgh, and penetrated far into Germany. Eric, King of Denmark, who commanded these Normans, sent once more a fleet into the Seine, which advanced to Paris. Its inhabitants fled, and the city was burnt. Another fleet, with little resistance, pil laged Bourdeaux. To avert the arms of these ravagers, Charles the Bald bribed them with money ; and his successor, Charles the Gross, yielded them a part of his Flemish dominions. These were only incentives to fresh depredation. Paris was attacked a second time, but gallantly defended by Count Odo, or Eudes, and the ve-"], [65, "SECT. 7' MODERN HISTORY. 47 nerable Bishop Goslin. A truce was a second time concluded, and the barbarians only changed the scene of their attack. They besieged Sens, and plundered Burgundy, while an assembly of the States held at Mentz deposed the unworthy Charles, [who had, by his disgraceful treaties with the Normans and Saracens, and other rash measures, offended all his subjects,] and conferred the clown on the more deserving Eudes ; who, during a reign often years, manfully withstood the Normans. A great part of the states of France, however, refused his title to the crown, and gave their allegiance to Charles, surnamed the Simple. Rollo, the Norman, in 912, compelled the King of France to yield him a large portion of the territory ofNeustria, and to give him his daughter in marriage. The new kingdom was now called Normandy, of which Rouen was the capital. [Rollo submitted, soon after, to the rite of baptism, taking the name of Robert ; and it seems to be generally admitted that, compara tively with the other parts of France, his sub jects enjoyed, under his mild, equitable, and wise rule, a large share of happiness and free dom.] It is the race of those warriors whom we shall see presently the conquerors of England."], [66, "PART II. 48 MODERN HISTORY. VIIL EMPIRE OF THE EAST DURING THE EIGHTH AND NINTH CENTURIES. 1. While the new empire of the West was thus rapidly tending to dissolution, the empire of Constantinople retained yet a vestige of its ancient grandeur. It had lost its African and Syrian dependencies, and was plundered by the Saracens on the eastern frontier, and ravaged on the north and west by the Abari and Bul garians.

In the latter part of this period, a most violent controversy was maintained respecting the worship of images, and they were alter nately destroyed and replaced according to the humour of the sovereign. The female sex were their most zealous supporters. This was not the only subject of division in the Christian church : the doctrines of the Manichees were then extremely prevalent, and [being proscribed by the court,] the sword was frequently em ployed to support and propagate their tenets ; [many thousands of them, however, went over to the Mahometans, and, in conjunction with the latter, ravaged all Asia Minor, up to the very gates of the imperial city.] 8. The misfortunes of the empire were in creased by an invasion of the Russians from the Palus M\u0153otis and Euxine.

STATE OF THE CHURCH IN THE EIGHTH AND NINTH CENTURIES. 1. The Popes had begun to acquire a tem poral authority under Pepin le Brief -and Char lemagne, from the donations of territory made by those princes, and they were now gradually extending a spiritual jurisdiction over all the Christian kingdoms. Nicholas I. proclaimed to the whole world his paramount judgment in ap peal from the sentences of all spiritual judica tories; his power of assembling councils of the church, and of regulating it by the canons of those councils ; the right of exercising his au thority by legates in all the kingdoms of Europe, and the control of the Pope over all princes and governors ; [and, in order to extend and conso lidate the Papal power, missionaries were dis patched in all directions to found new churches :"], [69, "SECT. 9. MODERN HISTORY. 51 as Austin had been sent into Britain by Gre gory ; St. Patrick into Ireland, and Boniface to Germany. Whoever were chosen for such mis sions by the court of Rome were naturally care ful to exalt the prerogatives of the Holy See, and to impress their converts with a deep sense of the supremacy of its bishops.] Literary impos ture gave its support to these pretences : the forgery of the epistles of Isidorus was not completely exposed till the sixteenth century. Among the prerogatives of the Popes was the regulation of the marriages of all crowned heads by the extreme extension of the prohibitions of the canon law, with which they alone had the power of dispensing. [It is upon record that one king of France, Henry the First, third of the Capetian race, in order to avoid the vexatious embarrassments of consanguinity which had in volved his predecessor in a contention with the see of Rome, sent even to Russia for a consort.] 2. One extraordinary event (if true) afforded, in the ninth century, a ludicrous interruption to the boasted succession of regular bishops from the days of St. Peter, the election of a female Pope, who is said to have ably governed the church for three years, till detected by the birth of a child. Till the Reformation by Luther, e 2"], [70, "52 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. this event was neither regarded by the Catholics as incredible, nor disgraceful to the church : since that time its truth or falsehood has been the subject of keen controversy between the Protestants and Catholics ; and the evidence for the latter seems to preponderate. 3- While the church was thus gradually ex tending its influence, and its head arrogating the control over sovereign princes, these, by a singular interchange of character, seem, in those ages, to have fixed their Ghief attention on spi ritual concerns. Kings, dukes, and counts, ne glecting their temporal duties, shut themselves up in cloisters, and spent their lives in prayers and penances. Ecclesiastics were employed in all the departments of secular government; and these alone conducted all public measures and state negociations, which of course they directed to the great objects of advancing the interests of the church, and establishing the paramount au thority of the Holy See. 4. At this period, however, when the Popedom seemed to have attained its highest ascendency, it suffered & \"T? wound in that remarkable schism which separated the patriarchates of Rome and Constantinople, or the Greek and Latin churches. The Roman Pontiff had hitherto"], [71, "SECT. 9- 53 MODERN HISTORY. claimed the right of nominating the patriarch of Constantinople. The Emperor Michael III. denied this right ; and deposing the Pope's patriarch, Ignatius, appointed the celebrated Photius in his stead. Pope Nicholas I. resented this affront with a high spirit, and deposed and excommunicated Photius, A.D. 863, who, in his turn, pronounced a similar sentence against the Pope. The church was divided, each patriarch being supported by many bishops and their dependent clergy. The Greek and Latin bishops had long differed in many points of practice and discipline, as the celibacy of the clergy, the shaving their beards, &c. ; but in reality the prime source of division was the ambition of the rival pontiffs, and the jealousy of the Greek emperors, unwilling to admit the control of Rome, and obstinately asserting every prerogative which they conceived to be annexed to the capital of the Roman empire. As neither party would yield its pretensions, the division of the Greek and Latin churches became from this time permanent. 5. Amid those ambitious contests for eccle siastical power and pre-eminence, the Christian religion itself was disgraced, both by the practice and by the principles of its teachers. Worldly e 3"], [72, "54 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. ambition, gross voluptuousness, and grosser ignorance, characterised all ranks of the clergy ; and the open sale of benefices placed them often in the hands of the basest and most profligate of men. Yet the character of Photius forms an illustrious exception. Though bred a statesman and a soldier, and in both these respects of great reputation, he attained, by his singular abilities, learning, and worth, the highest dignity of the church. His Bibliotheca is a monument of the most various knowledge, erudition, and critical judgment; [but is mortifying to the present age, as bearing testimony to the existence of various works of the classical writers of antiquity, now, in all probability, lost to the world.] X. OF THE SARACENS IN THE EIGHTH AND NINTH CENTURIES. 1, In the beginning of the eighth century, the Saracens subverted the monarchy of the Visigoths in Spain, and easily over-ran the country. They had lately founded in Africa the empire of Morocco, which was governed by"], [73, "SECT. 10. 55 MODERN HISTORY. Muza, viceroy of the Caliph Valid Almanzor. [A dispute about the succession to the Spanish throne led to an appeal to the African viceroy for aid and assistance.] Muza sent his General, Tariff, into Spain, who, in one memorable en- gagement, [in the plains of Xeres in Anda- lusia,] fought A.D. 713, stripped the Gothic King, Rodrigo, of his crown and life. The con- querors, satisfied with the sovereignty of the country, left the vanquished Goths in possession of their property, their laws, and their religion. Abdallah the Moor married the widow of Rodrigo, and the two nations formed a perfect union. One small part of the rocky country of Asturia alone adhered to its Christian prince, Pelagius, who [being crowned King of Oviedo, and having the support of all who disdained sub- mission, chiefly nobles and the sons of nobles,] maintained his little sovereignty, and transmitted it inviolate to his successors. 2. The Moors pushed their conquests beyond the Pyrenees ; but division arising among their emirs, and civil wars ensuing, Lewis le Debon naire took advantage of the turbulent state of the country, and invaded and seized Barcelona. The Moorish sovereignty in the north of Spain was weakened by throwing off its dependence on e 4"], [74, "56 PART II. MODERN history. the caliphs ; and at this juncture, the Christian sovereignty of the Asturias, under Alphonzo the Chaste, began to make vigorous encroachments on the territory of the Moors. Navarre and Arragon, roused by this example, chose each a Christian king, and boldly asserted their liberty and independence. 8. While the Moors of Spain were thus losing ground in the north, they were highly flourishing in the southern parts of that kingdom. Ab dalrahman, the last heir of the family of the Ommiades, (the Abassid\u00e6 now enjoying the ca liphate,) was recognised as the true represent ative of the ancient line by the southern Moors. He fixed the seat of his government at Cordova, which, from that time, for two centuries, was the capital of a splendid monarchy. This pe riod, from the middle of the eighth to the middle of the tenth century, is the most brilliant \u00e6ra of Arabian magnificence. Whilst Haroun Alras chid made Bagdat illustrious by the splendour of the arts and sciences, the Moors of Cordova vied with their brethren of Asia in the same honourable pursuits, and were undoubtedly, at this period, the most enlightened of the states in Europe. Under a series of able princes, they 10*"], [75, "SECT. 10. 57 MODERN HISTORY. gained the highest reputation, both in arts and arms, of all the nations of the West. 4. The Saracens were at this time extending their conquests in almost every quarter of the world. The Mahometan religion was professed over a great part of India, and all along the eastern and Mediterranean coast of Africa. The African Saracens invaded Sicily, and pro jected the conquest of Italy. They actually laid siege to Rome, which was nobly defended by Pope Leo IV., [a Roman by birth, who dis played at once the courage of the early ages of the Republic, and the moderation of a Christian minister.] They were repulsed, their ships were dispersed by a storm, and their army was cut to pieces, A.D. 848. 5. The Saracens might have raised an im mense empire, had they acknowledged only one head ; but their states were always disunited. Egypt, Morocco, [Nubia and Libya,] Spain, and India, had all their separate sovereigns, who, though they continued to respect the Caliph of Bagdat as the successor of the Prophet, acknow ledged no temporal subjection to his government."], [76, "58 PART II MODERN HISTORY. XI. EMPIRE OF THE WEST, AND ITALY IN THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH CENTURIES. ft The empire founded by Charlemagne now subsisted only in name. Arnold, a bastard son of Carloman, possessed Germany. Italy was divided between Guy Duke of Spoletto and Berengarius Duke of Friuli, who had received these duchies from Charles the Bald, [both of them by females, descended from Charlemagne.] France, though claimed by Arnold, was governed by Eudes. Thus the empire in reality consisted only of a part of Germany, while France, Spain, Italy, Burgundy, and the countries between the Maese and Rhine, were all subject to different powers. The Emperors were at this time elected by the bishops and grandees, all of whom claimed a voice. In this manner Lewis, the son of Arnold, the last of the blood of Charlemagne, was chosen Emperor after the death of his father. On his demise, Otho, Duke of Saxony, [who had acted as guardian to the young prince, and might himself have been elevated to the throne,]"], [77, "SECT. 11. MODERN HISTORY. 59 by his credit with his brother grandees, pro cured the empire [to be conferred] on Conrad Duke of Franconia, [a prince endowed with all the virtues of a King, and] at whose death Henry, surnamed the Fowler, son of the same Duke Otho, [who had nominated Conrad,] was, [through the exalted gratitude of the latter, and in prejudice of a brother of his own,] elected Emperor, A.D. 918. [While these things, how ever, were going on in Germany, the Popes en deavoured to bring the imperial dignity into Italy, by successively investing both Guy Duke of Spoletto and Berengarius of Friuli with it. The latter, the son of Gisella, daughter of Lewis le Debonnaire, being crowned Emperor in the year 916 ; in 924 he was assassinated.] 2. Henry I. (the Fowler), a prince of great abilities, introduced order and good government into the empire. He united the grandees, and curbed their usurpations ; built, embellished, and fortified the cities, [as securities against the ravages of the barbarous neighbours by whom he was surrounded ; converted the towns into places of resort for the exercise of arts and trades;] and enforced with great rigour the exe cution of the laws in the repression of all enor mities. He had been consecrated by his own"], [78, "60 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. bishops, and maintained no correspondence with the See of Rome. [Hence it has been customary with- some historians to consider the Imperial dignity vacant, while deprived of the Popes' sanction ; a circumstance it is almost necessary to notice, to prevent confusion ; the title of Emperor being freely given by the Popes to the Kings of Italy, in opposition to the German ap pointments.] 3. Henry's son Otho (the Great), [however, who had been chosen to succeed him, A.D. 936,] again united Italy to the empire, [A.D. 961,] and kept the Popedom in complete subjection. He made Denmark tributary to the Imperial crown, annexed the crown of Bohemia to his own dominions, and seemed to aim at a para mount authority over all the sovereigns of Europe. 4. Otho owed his ascendancy in Italy [partly to his marriage with Adelaide the widow of Lothaire, a deceased King of Italy, but princi pally] to the disorders of the Papacy. Formosus, twice excommunicated by Pope John VIIL, had himself arrived at the triple crown. On his death, his rival. Pope Stephen VII., caused his body to be dug out of the grave, [to be clothed in the pontifical habit,] and, aster trial for his"], [79, "SECT. 11. 61 MODERN HISTORY. crimes, condemned it to be [decapitated and] flung into the Tiber. The friends of Formosus fished up the corpse, and had interest to procure the deposition of Stephen, who was strangled in prison. A succeeding Pope, Sergius III., again dug up the ill-fated carcase, and once more threw it into the river. Two infamous women, Marozia and Theodora, managed for many years the Popedom, and filled the chair of St. Peter with their own gallants, or their adulterous offspring. Such was the state of the Holy See, when Berengarius Duke of Friuli disputed the sove reignty of Italy with Hugh of Aries. The Italian states and Pope John XII., who took part against Berengarius, invited Otho to com pose the disorders of the country. He entered Italy, defeated Berengarius, and was consecrated Emperor by the Pope, with the titles of C\u00e6sar and Augustus ; in return for which honours he confirmed the donations made to the Holy See by his predecessors, Pepin, Charlemagne, and Lewis le Debonnaire, A. D. 962. 5. But John XII. was false to his new ally. He made his peace with Berengarius, and both turned their arms against the Emperor. Otho flew back to Rome, and revenged himself by the trial and deposition of the Pope ; but he had"], [80, "62 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. scarcely left the city, when John, by the aid of his party, displaced his rival Leo VIIL, [and took ample revenge on those who were most active in deposing him, causing the right hand of the cardinal who had written and read the accusations against him to be cut off, and the secretary of the council to be still more cruelly mutilated.] Otho once more returned, and took exemplary vengeance on his enemies, by hanging one half of the senate. Calling together the Lateran Council, he created a new Pope and obtained from the assembled bishops a solemn acknowledgment of the absolute right of the Emperor to elect to the Papacy, to give the investiture of the crown of Italy, and to nominate to all vacant bishoprics ; concessions no longer observed than while the Emperor was present to enforce them. 6. Such was the state of Rome and Italy under Otho the Great ; [who has been compared to Charlemagne ; but in one thing he seems to have surpassed him, having with equal zeal, but in a much less exceptionable manner, done much to propagate the Christian religion, by a careful selection of ministers, competent to teach, and exemplary in their manners ; but such were the times, that even in this he erred, by throwing * ij"], [81, "63 SECT. 11. MODERN HISTORY. too much power into the hands of the clergy, of which the Popes were sure to take advantage.] Things continued much the same under his suc cessorsfor a century. [In 1024 the Saxon dynasty came to an end ; and in the person of Conrad the Second the empire passed to the Franconian line. Conrad was an able, active, and spirited prince, anxious to uphold the royal authority, though his reign was too short to admit of his completing the plans he had in view.] The Emperors, [however, continued to] assert their sovereignty over Italy and the Popedom, though with a constant resistance on the part of the Romans, and a general repugnance of the Pope, when once established. In those ages of ec clesiastical profligacy, [the history of which cannot be read without horror and disgust,] it was not unusual to put up the Popedom to sale. Benedict VIIL and John XIX., two brothers, publicly bought the chair of St. Peter, one after the other ; and to keep it in their family, it was purchased afterwards by their friends for Benedict IX. ; a child of twelve years of age. Three Popes, each pretending regular election, and equal right, agreed first to divide the re venues between them, and afterwards sold all their shares to a fourth."], [82, "64 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. 7. The Emperor Henry III., a prince of great ability, strenuously vindicated his right to supply the Pontifical Chair, and created three succes sive Popes without opposition ; [Clement II., 1046 ; Damasus II., 1048 ; and Leo IX., 1049. The latter, having in 1053 led an army in per son against the Normans, who had taken pos session of the southern provinces of Italy, was defeated and taken prisoner: but, as it hap pened, much to the advantage of the Holy See ; for, being treated with respect by his enemies, who were aware of the advantages they might gain from his friendship, he was induced to assume the privilege of formally granting them the investiture of Puglia, Calabria, and Sicily, as fiefs of the Holy See ; which example being followed by his successors, converted from that time the Normans into powerful auxiliaries in favour of the court of Rome, against the Emperors.]"], [83, "SECT. 12. 65 MODERN HISTORY. XII. HISTORY OF BRITAIN FROM ITS EARLIEST PERIOD DOWN TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST. 1. The history of Britain has been postponed to this time, in order that it may be considered in one connected view from its earliest period to the end of the Anglo-Saxon government. We strive not to pierce through that mist of obscurity which veils the original population of the British isles ; remarking only, as a matter of high probability, that they derived their first inhabitants from the Celt\u00e6 of Gaul. Their authentic history commences -with the first Roman invasion ; and we learn from C\u00e6sar and Tacitus, that the country was at that period in a state very remote from barbarism. It was divided into a number of small independent sovereignties, each prince having a regular army and a fixed revenue. The manners, lan guage, and religion of the people were the same with those of the Gallic Celt\u00e6. The last was the Druidical system, whose influence pervaded VOL. II. F"], [84, "66 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. every department of the government, and, by its power over the minds of the people, supplied the imperfection of laws. 2. Julius C\u00e6sar, after the conquest of Gaul, turned his eyes towards Britain. He landed on the southern coast of the island, 55 B. C. ; and meeting with most obstinate resistance, though on the whole gaining some advantage, he found himself obliged, after a short campaign, to with draw for the winter into Gaul. He returned in the following summer with a great increase of force, an army of 20,000 foot, a competent body of horse, and a fleet of 800 sail. The inde pendent chiefs of the Britons united their forces under Cassibelanus, King of the Trinobantes, and encountering the legions with great reso lution, displayed all the ability of practised warriors. But the contest was vain. C\u00e6sar advanced into the country, burnt Verulamium, [the present town of St. Alban's,] the capital of Cassibelanus, and, after forcing the Britons into articles of submission, returned to Gaul. 3. The domestic disorders of Italy gave tran quillity to the Britons for near a century ; but, in the reign of Claudius, the conquest of the island was determined. The Emperor landed in Britain, and compelled the submission of the"], [85, "67 SECT. 12. MODERN HISTORY. south-eastern provinces. Ostorius Scapula de feated Caractacus, who was sent prisoner to Rome, [where, in credit to the Romans it should be observed, that in consideration of the noble stand he had made in defence of his country, he was liberally and kindly enter tained.] Suetonius Paulinus, the General of Nero, destroyed Mona, (Anglesey, or, as others think, Man,) the centre of the Druidical super stition. The Iceni, (inhabitants of Norfolk and Suffolk,) under their Queen Boadicea, attacked several of the Roman settlements. London, with its Roman garrison, was burnt to ashes. But a decisive battle ensued, in which 80,000 of the Britons fell in the field, A.D. 61, [and Boadicea, unwilling to survive the liberties of her country, put an end to her life by poison.] The reduction of the island, however, was not completed till thirty years afterwards, in the reign of Titus, by Julius Agricola ; who, after securing the Roman province against invasion from the Caledonians by walls and garrisons, [between the Firths of Forth and Clyde,] reconciled the southern inhabitants, by the introduction of Roman arts and improvements, to the govern ment of their conquerors. [Adrian contracted the limits fixed upon by Agricola by building a f 2"], [86, "68 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. second wall between Newcastle and Carlisle ; but] under Severus the Roman province was again far extended into the north of Scotland, [and secured by walls and fortresses built of more durable materials than those of either Agricola or Adrian]. 4. With the decline of the Roman power in the west, the southern Britons recovered their liberty, but it was only to become the object of incessant predatory invasion from their brethren of the north. The Romans, after rebuilding the wall of Severus, finally bid adieu to Britain, A. D. 448. The Picts and Caledonians now broke down upon the south, ravaging and de solating the country, though without a purpose of conquest, merely, as it appears, for the supply of their temporary wants. After repeated ap plication for aid from Rome, without success, [her legions being necessarily engaged and oc cupied in other parts,] the Britons meanly soli cited the Saxons of Germany for succour and protection. [Such, at least, is the account of Gildas ; but as his authority has been since judged to be extremely questionable, and even to be contradicted by the testimony of Zosimus, the more probable state of the case seems to be, that Vortigern, being pressed by his adversaries,"], [87, "SECT. 12. 69 MODERN HISTORY. and anxious to support his contested authority, accepted the services of some Saxons who had landed in the south of Britain, and who per suaded him to invite more of their countrymen from the opposite shores to his assistance.] 5. The Saxons received the embassy with great satisfaction. Britain had been long known to them in their piratical voyages to its coasts. They landed to the amount of 1600, under the command of Hengist and Horsa, A.D. 450, and, joining the south Britons, soon compelled the Scots to retire to their mountains. They next turned their thoughts to the entire reduc tion of the Britons ; and receiving large rein* forcements of their countrymen, after an obsti nate contest of near 150 years, they reduced the whole of England under the Saxon government, [many of the natives taking refuge in Wales, the remote county of Cornwall, and Armorica in France, subsequently called, on this account, the province of Bretagne.~\\ Seven distinct provinces thus became [under the Saxons] as many independent kingdoms ; [perhaps as Nor thumberland was divided into two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, we should rather speak of them as eight.] 6. The history of the Saxon Heptarchy, [or f 3"], [88, "70 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. Octarchy, as some have called it,] is uninterest- ing, from its obscurity and confusion. It is sufficient to mark the duration of the several kingdoms till their union under Egbert. Kent began in 455, and lasted, under seventeen princes, till 827, when it was subdued by the West Saxons. Under Ethelbert, one of its kings, the Saxons were converted to Christia- nity by the monk Augustine. Northumberland began in 597> and lasted, under twenty-three kings, till 79*2. East Anglia began in 575, and ended in 793. Mercia subsisted from 582 to 827. Essex had fourteen princes from 527 to 747 ; Sussex only five ; before its reduction under the dominion of the West Saxons, about 600. Wessex, which finally subdued and united the whole of the Heptarchy, began in 519, and had not subsisted above eighty years, when Cadwalla, its king, conquered and annexed Sussex to his dominions. [Though the accounts of these matters are, as we have observed, ex- tremely confused, yet in such a state of perpe- tual struggles and exertions, in which the spirit of liberty was not lost sight of, it cannot be de- nied, that there was a progress towards improve- ment, and that in one province or another there was a continual succession of distinguished men.]"], [89, "SECT. 12. 71 MODERN HISTORY. As there was no fixed rule of succession, it was the policy of the Saxon princes to put to death all the rivals of their intended successor. From this cause, and from the passion for celibacy, the royal families were nearly extinguished in the kingdoms of the Heptarchy ; and Egbert, Prince of the West Saxons, remained the sole surviving descendant of the Saxon conquerors of Britain. This circumstance, so favourable to his ambition, prompted him to attempt the con quest of the Heptarchy. He succeeded in that enterprise ; and by his victorious arms and judi cious policy, [much of which may reasonably be attributed to his residence for some time at the court of Charlemagne,] the whole of the separate states were united into one great king dom, A.T). 827, near 400 years after the first arrival of the Saxons in Britain. 7. England, thus united, was far from en joying tranquillity. The piratical Normans or Danes had for fifty years desolated her coasts, and continued for some centuries after this period to be a perpetual scourge to the country. [Unfortunately an English monarch had been induced to follow the example of Charles the Bald of France, fay offering them money, and the same fault had the same punishment, in f 4"], [90, "72 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. inducing them speedily to return for more.] Under Alfred (the Great), [the fourth son of Ethel wolf, and] grandson of Egbert, the kingdom was from this cause reduced to extreme wretch edness. The heroic Alfred, in one year, en gaged and defeated the Danes in eight battles ; when a new irruption of their countrymen forced him to solicit a peace, which these pirates con stantly interrupted by new hostilities. The monarch himself, [his subjects being dispirited by the successes of the invaders,] was compelled to seek his safety for many months in an obscure quarter of the country, till the disorders of the Danish army offered a fair opportunity [of ral lying his countrymen,] which [he was careful to improve,] to the entire defeat of his enemies. He might have cut them all to pieces, but he chose rather to spare and to incorporate them vith his English subjects. This clemency did not restrain them from attempting a new inva sion ; but they were again defeated with im menst; loss : and the extreme severity now from necessity shown to the vanquished had the effect of suspending, for several years, the Da nish depredations. 8. Alfred, whether considered in his public or private character, deserves to be reckoned"], [91, "SECT. 12. 73 MODERN HISTORY. among the best and greatest of princes. He united the most enterprising and heroic spirit with consummate prudence and moderation ; the utmost vigour of authority with the most engaging gentleness of manner ; the most exem plary justice with the greatest lenity ; the talents of the statesman, and the man of letters, with the intrepid resolution and conduct of the ge neral. He found the kingdom in the most miserable condition to which anarchy, domestic barbarism, and foreign hostility, could reduce it : he brought it to a pitch of eminence surpass- sing, in many respects, the situation of its con- temporary nations. [He encouraged agriculture, and in his care to protect his country from the depredations of the Danes, may be said to have given the first impulse to the formation of an English navy.] 9. Alfred divided England into counties, with their subdivisions of hundreds and tithings. The tithing or decennary consisted of ten fa milies, over which presided a tithing-man, or borgholder ; and ten of these composed the hundred. Every householder was answerable for his family, and the tithing-man for all within his tithing. In the decision of differences, the tithing-man had the assistance of the rest of his"], [92, "74 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. decennary. An appeal lay from the decennary to the court of the hundred, which was assem- bled every four weeks ; and the cause was tried by a jury of twelve freeholders, sworn to do im- partial justice. An annual meeting of the hun- dred was held for the regulation of the police of the district. The county-court, superior to that of the hundred, and consisting of all the free- holders, met twice a year, after Michaelmas and Easter, to determine appeals from the hundreds, and settle disputes between the inhabitants of different hundreds. The ultimate appeal from all these courts lay to the King in council ; and the frequency of these appeals prompted Alfred to the most extreme circumspection in the ap- pointment of his judges ; [whom he afterwards made no hesitation of degrading, if they fell into corrupt practices.] He composed, for the regu lation of these courts, and of his kingdom, a body of laws, the basis of the common law of England. 10. Alfred, [who had very accidentally been carried to Rome in his early youth,] gave every encouragement to the cultivation of letters, as the best means of eradicating barbarism. He invited, from every quarter of Europe, the learned to reside in his dominions, established"], [93, "SECT. 12. MODERN HISTORY. 75 schools, and is said to have founded the Uni versity of Oxford. [All employments in church or state were confided to those, and those only, who had made some progress in the sciences.] He was himself a most accomplished scholar for the age in which he lived, as appears from the works he composed ; poetical apologues, the translation of the histories of Bede and Orosius, and of Boethius on the Consolation of Philosophy. [Such occupations in a Prince who is credibly re ported to have been engaged, in defence of his kingdom, in no less than fifty-six battles by sea and land, are certainly very remarkable.] In every view of his character we must regard Al fred the Great as one of the best and wisest men that ever occupied the regal seat. [Educated in the school of adversity, he was a brave and skis ul soldier, a truly patriotic king, an able legislator, the friend of virtue, and patron of learning.] He died in the vigour of his age, A. D. 901, after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years and a half. 11. The admirable institutions of Alfred were partially and feebly enforced under his succes sors ; and England, still a prey to the ravages of the Danes and intestine disorder, relapsed into confusion and barbarism. The reigns of Edward"], [94, "76 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. the Elder, the son of Alfred, and of his succes sors, Athelstan, Edmund, and Edred, were tu multuous and anarchical; [though during the reign of Athelstan commerce appears to have received considerable encouragement.] The clergy began to extend their authority over the throne, and a series of succeeding princes were the obsequious slaves of their tyranny and ambition. [This was the period when the celebrated Dun stan introduced into England the monastic insti tutions of the Benedictine order, so necessary to the support of the Papal power and influence. So great was his pride and presumption, that Edwy, the successor of Edred, suffered at his hands the grossest indignities ; Odo, [Archbishop of Canter bury, supporting and assisting the bigoted monk in the most outrageous of his proceedings.] Under Ethelred, A. D. 981, the Danes seriously projected the conquest of England, and, led by Sweyn King of Denmark, and Olaus King of Norway, made a formidable descent, won several important battles, and were restrained from the destruction of London only by a dastardly sub mission, and a promise of tribute to be paid by the inglorious Ethelred. The English nobility were ashamed of their Prince, and seeing no other re lief to the kingdom, made a tender of the crown"], [95, "SECT. 12. MODERN HISTORY. 77 to the Danish monarch. On the death of Sweyn, Ethelred attempted to regain his kingdom, but found in Canute, the son of Sweyn, a Prince de termined to support his claims, which, on the death of Ethelred, were gallantly but ineffect ually resisted by his son Edmund Ironside. At length a partition of the kingdom was made be tween Canute and Edmund, which, after a few months, the Danes annulled by the murder of Edmund, thus securing to their monarch Canute the throne of all England, A. D. 1017. Ed mund left two children, Edgar Atheling, and Margaret, afterwards wife to Malcolm Canmore, King of Scotland. 12. Canute, the most powerful monarch of his time, sovereign of Denmark, Norway, and England, swayed for seventeen years the sceptre of England with a firm and vigorous hand ; se vere in the beginning of his reign, while his go vernment was insecure, but mild and equitable when possessed of a settled dominion ; [and so exceedingly impartial, as to have acquired the credit of maintaining, between the different people he had to govern, an exact equality, in dignity, in council, and in war.] He lest, (A. D. 1036,) three sons, Sweyn, who was crowned King of Norway, Harold, who sue-"], [96, "PART II*. 78 MODERN HISTORY. ceeded to the throne of England, and Har- dicanute, sovereign of Denmark. Harold, a merciless tyrant, died in the fourth year of his reign, and was succeeded by Hardicanute, who, after a violent administration of two years, died in a fit of debauch. The English seized this opportunity of shaking off the Danish yoke ; and they conferred the crown on Edward, a younger son of Ethelred, rejecting the preferable right of Edgar Atheling, the son of Edmund, who, un- fortunately for his pretensions, was, at this time, abroad in Hungary. Edward, surnamed the Confessor, (A. D. 1041,) reigned weakly and ingloriously for twenty-five years. The rebel lious attempts of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, aimed at nothing less than an usurpation of the crown ; and, on his death, his son Harold, cherishing se- cretly the same views of ambition, [and having married the heiress of the Danish kings,] had the address to secure to his interest a very for midable party in the kingdom. Edward, to de feat these views, bequeathed the crown to Wil liam Duke of Normandy, a Prince whose great abilities and personal prowess had rendered his name illustrious over Europe. 13.

He made the most formidable preparations, aided in this age of romantic enterprise by many of the sovereign princes, and a vast body of the nobility, from the different continental kingdoms, [having, besides, the express approbation of the Emperor and Pope.] A Norwegian fleet of 300 sail [at this critical moment] entered the Humber, and disembarking their troops, were, after one successful engagement, defeated by the English army in the interest of Harold. William landed his army on the coast of Sussex, to the amount of 60,000 ; and the English, under Harold, flushed with their recent success [against the Norwegians,] hastily advanced to meet him, imprudently resolving to venture all on one decisive battle.

PART II. XIII. OF THE GOVERNMENT, LAWS, AND MANNERS OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS. 1. The government, laws, and manners of the Anglo-Saxons have become the subject of enquiry to modern writers, as being supposed to have had their influence in the formation of the British constitution. The government of the Saxons was the same with that of all the ancient Germanic nations, and they naturally retained in their new settlement in Britain a policy similar to their accustomed usages, [except that, instead of an aristocratical form of government, they divided their conquests in England into kingdoms, ad- mitting the title of King.] Their subordination, however, was chiefly a military one, the King having no more authority than what belonged to the General, or military leader. There was no strict rule of succession to the throne ; for although the King was generally chosen from the family of the last prince, the choice usually fell on the person of the best capacity for go- 5 *"], [99, "SECT. 13. 81 MODERN HISTORY. vernment. In some instances the destination of the last sovereign regulated the choice. We know very little of the nature of the Anglo- Saxon government, or of the distinct rights of the sovereign and people. [But with regard to the crown, it seems that though there was gene rally a disposition manifested to let it descend in one family, and even upon occasion to submit to the appointment of the successor by the ruling monarch, still the nation expected to be made a party to all these modes of succession by means of its public assembly or legislature, of which we are about to give an account.] 2. One institution common to all the king doms of the Heptarchy was the Wittenagemot, or assembly of the wise men, whose consent was requisite for enacting laws, and ratifying the chief acts of public administration. The bishops and abbots formed a part of this assembly, as did the aldermen, or earls, and governors of counties. The Wites, or wise men, are discri minated from the prelates and nobility, and have by some been supposed to have been the repre sentatives of the commons. But we hear nothing of election or representation in those periods, and we must therefore presume that they were merely landholders, or men of considerable VOL. H. G"], [100, "82 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. estate, who, from their weight and consequence in the country, were held entitled, without any election, to take a share in the public deliber ations. [Every kingdom had its distinct Witten agemot, while there was also a general assembly sometimes held to discuss and determine matters that concerned all the kingdoms in common. Indeed it has with much reason been supposed that the Saxon Wittenagemot, or assembly of \u2022wise men, Wites, was a sort of standing senate, with the King at the head, whose office it was to prepare the laws and regulations, to be after wards submitted to the Mycel-gemot, or general legislative assembly, to which all the land-holders were admitted, and without whose consent no law could become valid.] 3. The Anglo-Saxon government was ex tremely aristocratical, the regal authority being very limited, [though it has been alleged, that the king's consent was necessary to the passing of a law,] the rights of the people little known or regarded, and the nobility possessing much un controlled and lawless rule over their dependents. The offices of government were hereditary in their families, and they commanded the whole military force of their respective provinces. So strict was the clientela between these nobles and"], [101, "SECT. 13. 83 MODERN HISTORY. their vassals, that the murder of a vassal was compensated by a fine paid to his lord. 4. There were three ranks of the people, the nobles, the free, and the slaves. The nobles were either the king's thanes, who held their lands directly from the sovereign, or lesser thanes, who held lands from the former. [Another distinction seems to have prevailed, of mass or ecclesiastical thanes, and werold or lay thanes.] One law of Athelstan declared, that a merchant who had made three voyages on his own account was entitled to the dignity of thane ; another decreed the same rank to a ceorle, or husband man, who was able to purchase five Irides of land, and had a chapel, a kitchen, a hall, and a bell. The ceorles, or freemen of the lower rank, occupied the farms of the thanes, for which they paid rent, and they were removable at the pleasure of their lord. [Among these, also, may be reckoned the merchants and arti ficers, who being neither military nor persons of landed property, were, as long as they con tinued so, regarded with contempt.] The slaves or villains were either employed in domestic purposes, or in cultivating the lands. A master was fined for the murder of his slave ; and, g 2"], [102, "84 MODERN HISTORY. PART II if he mutilated him, the slave recovered his freedom. 5. Under this aristocratical government there were some traces of the ancient Germanic de mocracy. The courts of the decennary, the hundred, and the county, were a considerable restraint on the power of the nobles. In the county-courts the freeholders met twice a year to determine appeals by the majority of suffrages. The alderman presided in those courts, but had no vote : he received a third of the fines, the remaining two-thirds devolving to the king, which was a great part of the royal revenue. [After the introduction of Christianity, the Bishop or Archdeacon was also expected to at tend, and indeed obliged to assist in the determin ation of ecclesiastical questions ; which in the county-court or shire-mot had the preference ; the second place being given to the pleas of the crown, and, lastly, to the causes of private per sons.] Pecuniary fines were the ordinary atone ment for every species of crime, and the modes of proof were the ordeal by fire or water, or by compurgators. (See supra, Part II. Sect. V. \u00a7 7.) 6. As to the military force, the expense of defending the state lay equally on all the land, every five hides or ploughs being taxed to fur-"], [103, "SECT. 13. 85 MODERN HISTORY. nish a soldier. There were 243,600 hides in England, consequently the ordinary military force consisted of 48,720 men. 7. The king's revenue, besides the fines im posed by the courts, consisted partly of his demesnes of property-lands, which were exten sive, and partly in imposts on boroughs and sea-ports. The Danegelt was a tax imposed by the states, either for payment of tribute exacted by the Danes, or for defending the kingdom against them. By the custom of gavelkind; [still acknowledged in the county of Kent, and partially in some other places,] the land was divided equally among all the male children of the deceased proprietor. Book-land was that which was held by charter, and folk-land what was held by tenants removable at pleasure. 8. The Anglo-Saxons were behind the Nor mans in every point of civilisation ; and the conquest was therefore to them a real advantage, as it led to material improvement in arts, science, government, and laws.

France, from the extent and splendour of its dominion under Charlemagne, had dwindled to a shadow under his weak posterity. At the end of the Carlovingian period, France compre hended neither Normandy, Dauphine, nor Pro vence. On the death of Lewis V. (Faineant,) the crown ought to have devolved on his uncle, Charles of Brabant, [and Hainault,] as the last male of the race of Charlemagne ; but Hugh Capet, Lord of Picardy, Champagne, [and the duchy of France, in which Paris was situ ated,] the most powerful of the French nobles, was elected sovereign by the voice of his bro ther-peers, A.D. 987- [Though Hugh Capet was personally both brave and wise, yet Charles made some efforts to recover the dominions of his ancestors ; but falling into the power of his rival he was thrown into prison, where he ended his days, after having two sons born to him,"], [105, "SECT. 14. 87 MODERN HISTORY. whose destiny is unknown.] The kingdom, torn by parties, suffered much domestic misery under his reign, and that of his [son and] suc cessor Robert, who, [though remarkably boun tiful to the clergy, and of singularly religious habits,] was the victim of papal tyranny, for daring to marry a distant cousin without the dispensation of the church. [Paris, which had originally been made the capital of the kingdom by Clovis, but abandoned again during the reigns of the last kings of the first race, and by the whole of the second dynasty, became once more the seat of government under the Capetian monarchs, and has continued so to this day.] 2. The prevailing passion of the times was pilgrimage and chivalrous enterprise. In this career of adventure the Normans, [from the remotest shores of Scandinavia,] most remark ably distinguished themselves. In 983, [hav ing descended as low as the Mediterranean sea,] they relieved the Prince of Salerno, [in Italy,] by expelling the Saracens from his ter ritory. They did a similar service to Pope Bene dict VIIL and the Duke of Capua; while another band of their countrymen fought first against the Greeks, and afterwards against the Popes, always selling their services to those who best g 4"], [106, "88 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. rewarded them. William Fierabras, and his brothers, Humphrey, Robert, and Richard, kept the Pope, [Leo IX. who had ventured to excom municate the Normans,] a prisoner for a year at Benevento, and forced the court of Rome, [under Nicolas II.] to yield Capua to Richard, and Apulia and Calabria to Robert, with the investiture of Sicily, if he should gain the country from the Saracens. In 1101, Rogero the Norman completed the conquest of Sicily, of which the Popes continued to be the lords para mount. 3. The north of Europe was in those periods extremely barbarous. Russia received the Chris tian religion in the eighth century. Sweden, after its conversion in the ninth century, re lapsed into idolatry, as did Hungary and Bohe mia. The Constantinopolitan empire defended its frontiers with difficulty against the Bulga rians on the west; and against the Turks and Arabians on the east and north. 4. In Italy, excepting the territory of the Popedom, the principalities of the independent nobles, and the states of Venice and Genoa, the greatest part of the country was now in the pos session of the Normans. Venice and Genoa were rising gradually to great opulence from"], [107, "SECT. 14. MODERN HISTORY. 89 commerce. Venice was for some ages tributary to the Emperors of Germany. In the tenth cen tury its Doge, [an office erected towards the close of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century,] assumed the title of Duke of Dalmatia, of which the republic had acquired the property by con quest, as well as of Istria, Spalatro, Ragusa, and Narenza. 5. Spain was chiefly possessed by the Moors ; the Christians retaining only about a fourth of the kingdom, namely, Asturia, part of Castile and Catalonia, Navarre, and Arragon. Portugal was likewise occupied by the Moors. Their capital was Cordova, the seat of luxury and magnificence. In the tenth century the Moorish dominions were split among a number of petty sovereigns, who were constantly at war with each other ; [or, as is most common, in such a state of things, gratifying their revenge by sur prisals, poisonings, and assassinations ;] but such, unfortunately, was likewise the situation of the Christian part of the kingdom ; and it was no uncommon policy for the Christian princes to form alliances with the Moors against each other. Besides these, the country abounded with independent lords, who made war their profession, and performed the office of cham-"], [108, "PART II. 90 MODERN HISTORY. pions in deciding the quarrels of princes, or enlisting themselves in their service, with all their vassals and attendants. Of these, termed Cavalleros andantes, or knights-errant, the most distinguished was Rodrigo the Cid, who under took for his sovereign, Alphonso King of Old Castile, to conquer the kingdom of New Castile, and achieved it with success, obtaining the go vernment of Valencia as the reward of his ser vices ; [where, though he ruled as king, he abstained from taking the title.] 6. The contentions between the Imperial and Papal powers make a distinguished figure in those ages. [From the time that Otho the Great received the Imperial crown from the Pope, the Emperors were considered as the temporal, the Popes as the spiritual, heads of Christendom, as though the Christians of all states and countries were included in one grand republic. Hence, the right of precedence, and other privileges, allowed to the Emperors, particularly that of con voking councils, but, above all, the prerogative of nominating or confirming the election of the Popes.] Henry III. vindicated the Imperial right to fill the chair of St. Peter, and nominated three successive Popes, [see supra, Part II. Sect. XL \u00a7 7.] without the intervention of a"], [109, "SECT. 14. MODERN HISTORY. 91 council of the church. But in the minority of his son Henry IV., this right was frequently in terrupted, and Alexander II. kept his seat, though the Emperor named another in his place. It was the lot of this Emperor to experience the utmost extent of Papal insolence and tyranny. After a spirited contest with [the celebrated Hildebrand,] Gregory VIL, in which the Pope was twice his prisoner, and the Emperor as often excommunicated and deposed, Henry fell at length the victim of ecclesiastical vengeance. Urban II. [one of the] successors of Gregory, prompted the two sons of Henry to rebel against their father; and his misfortunes were finally terminated by imprisonment and death in 1106. [The original contest between Henry and Gregory, which seemed to relate chiefly to the disputed right of investiture, had undoubtedly a much higher object in the views of Gregory *$ no less, in short, than to raise the spiritual above the temporal authority in all the states of Europe ; though Henry received the first attacks, not only in consequence of the close connection subsist ing between the Imperial and Papal courts, but also through the imprudence of Henry, who had appealed to the latter against his own subjects, thereby constituting Gregory a judge over him-"], [110, "92 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. self; for the Saxon insurgents recriminated. The character of Gregory has been variously repre- sented : very false charges were unquestionably brought against him. His zeal in behalf of the church appears to have been at least an honest one ; and it is probable that if he seemed to carry things with too high a hand, it was to stem the grossest corruption of morals, as manifested in the scandalous lives both of the clergy and laity.] The same contest went on under a succession of Popes and Emperors, but ended commonly in favour of the former. Frederic 1. (Barbarossa), [the second monarch of the Suabian dynasty,] a prince of high spirit, after an indignant denial of the supremacy of Alexander III., and a re- fusal of the customary homage, was at length compelled to kiss his feet, and appease his Holiness, by a large cession of territory. Pope Celestinus [at eighty-six years of age] kicked off the Imperial crown of Henry VI. while doing homage on his knees, but made amends for this insolence by the gift of Naples and Sicily, from which Henry had expelled the Normans. These territories now became an appanage of the empire, 1194. \u2014 The succeeding Popes rose on the pretensions of their predecessors, till at length Innocent III., in the beginning of the"], [111, "93 SECT. 15.

It was the same Pope Innocent whom we shall presently see the disposer of the crown of England in the reign of the tyrant John. XV. HISTORY OF ENGLAND IN THE ELEVENTH, TWELFTH, AND PART OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURIES. 1. The consequence of the battle of Hastings was the submission of all England to William the Conqueror ; [though not altogether without conditions bearing the character of a compact or agreement between two contracting parties, a circumstance which may require attention. The term Conquestor in its feudal acceptation not implying so much as is generally understood, by the English term Conqueror, or the French Con querant. The defeat of Harold, who assumed the title of King, appears to have given ground"], [112, "94 PART IX. MODERN HISTORY. to some mistakes upon this head.] The cha racter of this prince was spirited, haughty, and tyrannical, yet not without *a portion of the generous affections. [The beginning of his government was sufficiently mild and concilia tory ; but in process of time] he disgusted his English subjects by the strong partiality he showed to his Norman followers, preferring them to all offices of trust and dignity. A con spiracy arose from these discontents, which William defeated, and avenged with signal rigour and cruelty. He determined henceforward to treat the English as a conquered people. [He commanded all pleadings to be in the Norman tongue, and established schools for the instruc tion of youth in it, that the mother-tongue might be entirely superseded. He abolished the Saxon laws, and substituted in their stead those of Normandy ; and in every respect gave a pre ference to his French subjects, or Norman fol lowers, in church and state, with some detri ment to himself in the former instance, since the foreign clergy, being too subservient to the court of Rome, were an hinderance to William in his attempts to become independent of the Papal authority. Such a course of] policy involved his reign, [as might well be expected,] in per-"], [113, "SECT. 15. MODERN HISTORY. 95 petual commotions, and which, while they robbed him of all peace of mind, aggravated the tyranny of his disposition. To his own children he owed the severest of his troubles. His eldest son Robert rose in rebellion to wrest from him the sovereignty of Maine ; and his foreign subjects took part with the rebel. William led against them an army of the English, and was on the point of perishing in fight by his son's hand. Philip I. of France had aided this rebellion, which was avenged by William, who carried havoc and devastation into the heart of his kingdom, but was killed in the enterprise by a fall from his horse, IO87. He bequeathed England to William his second son ; to Robert he left Normandy ; and to Henry, his youngest son, the property of his mother Matilda. 2. William the Conqueror introduced into England the feudal law, dividing the whole king dom, except the royal demesnes, into baronies, and bestowing the most of these, under the tenure of military service, on his Norman fol lowers, [thus establishing the system in his English dominions, upon a very different footing than it stood in France, where many lords of fiefs were independent of the sovereign.] By the forest laws he reserved to himself the ex-"], [114, "96 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. elusive privilege of killing game all over the kingdom ; a restriction resented by his subjects above every other mark of servitude. Prepara tory to the introduction of the feudal tenures, he planned and accomplished a general survey of all the lands in the kingdom, with a distinct specification of their extent, nature, value, names of their proprietors, and an enumeration of every class of inhabitants who lived on them. This most valuable record, called Doomsday -book, is preserved in the English Exchequer, and is now printed. 3. William II. (Rufus) inherited the vices without any of the virtues of his father. His reign is distinguished by no event of import ance ; and, after the defeat of one conspiracy in its outset, presents nothing but a dull career of unresisted despotism. [The two parties into which the kingdom was divided, the English and Normans, being mutually afraid of giving some advantage to the other, if they attempted to move.] After a reign of thirteen years he was killed when hunting, by the random shot of an arrow, 1100. The crown of England should have devolved on his elder brother Robert ; but his absence on a crusade in Palestine made way for the unopposed succession of his younger"], [115, "SECT. 15. MODERN HISTORY. 97 brother. Henry, who, by his marriage with Ma tilda, [of Scotland,] the niece of Edgar Atheling, united the last remnant of the Saxon with the Norman line ; [a circumstance of much benefit to the nation, as tending to unite the two rival factions, and form them into one nation parti cipating in common rights and privileges ; a benefit Henry was prudent enough to grant them, to cover his usurpation of the crown. To this also may be attributed his express grant of a royal charter, the model, according to Spelman and Blackstone, of the celebrated Magna Charta of John.] With the most criminal ambition he invaded his brother's dominions of Normandy, [during his absence in the Holy Land ;] and Robert, on his return, was defeated in battle, and detained for life a prisoner in England. The crimes of Henry were expiated by his misfor tunes. His only son was drowned in his passage from Normandy. His daughter Matilda, mar ried first to the Emperor Henry V. and after wards to Geoffrey Plantagenet of Anjou, was destined to be his successor ; but the popularity of his nephew Stephen, son of the Count of Blois, [and grandson of the Conqueror,] de feated this intention. Henry I. died in Nor mandy, after a reign of thirty-five years, A.D. VOL. II. H"], [116, "98 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. 1135 ; and, in spite of his destination to Matilda, Stephen seized the vacant throne. The party of Matilda, [who had the clergy on her side,] headed by her natural brother, the Earl of Glou cester, engaged, defeated, and made Stephen prisoner. Matilda, in her turn, mounted the throne ; but, unpopular from the tyranny of her disposition, she was solemnly deposed by the prevailing party of her rival, and Stephen once more restored. He found, however, in Henry Plantagenet, the son of Matilda, a more formid able competitor. Of a noble and intrepid spirit, while yet a boy, he resolved to reclaim his here ditary crown ; and, landing in England, won by his prowess, and the favour of a just cause, a great part of the kingdom to his interest. By treaty with Stephen, who was allowed to reign for life, he secured the succession at his death, which soon after ensued, 11 54, [a son of Stephen, Eustace, very critically dying at the moment of the negotiation.] 4. Henry II., a prince in every sense deserv ing of the throne, [educated and instructed by his uncle, the Earl of Gloucester, a nobleman of singular virtue and judgment,] began his reign with the reformation of all the abuses of the government of his predecessors; revoking"], [117, "SECT. 15. MODERN HISTORY. 99 all impolitic grants, abolishing partial immuni ties, regulating the administration of justice, and establishing the freedom of the towns by charters, which are at this day the basis of the na tional liberty. [He shook the feudal institutions, by the introduction of scutages, or pecuniary compensations, for that personal service which the military vassals were bound otherwise to perform; \u2014 the parent of subsidies to the crown in after times, as well as of the land-tax. They were first levied by the royal authority, but afterwards, to prevent abuses, by a decree of the national council.] Happy in the affections of his people, and powerful in the vast extent of additional territory he enjoyed on the Continent in right of his father and of his wife, the heiress of a great portion of France, his reign had every promise of prosperity and happiness ; but, from one fa tal source, these pleasing prospects were all de stroyed. Thomas Becket was raised by Henry from obscurity to the office of chancellor of Eng land. On the vacancy of the see of Canterbury, the King, desirous of his aid in the correction of ecclesiastical abuses, conferred the primacy on his favourite ; and the arrogant Becket availed himself of that authority to abase the prerog ative of his sovereign, and exalt the spiritual h 2"], [118, "100 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. power above the crown. [Henry was desirous of doing away the exemption, which the clergy enjoyed from secular jurisdiction.] It was dis puted whether a priest could be tried for a mur der, and punished by the civil court. It was determined in the affirmative by the council of Clarendon, against the opinion of Becket, [who had previously engaged himself to the legate, to abide by the ancient customs.] Pope Alex ander III., however, annulled the decree of the council ; and Becket, who took part with the Pope, [refused to yield to its decision, and] was deprived by Henry of all his dignities and estates. He avenged himself by the excommu nication of the King's ministers ; and Henry, in return, prohibited all intercourse with the see of Rome. At length both parties found it their interest to come to a good understanding. Becket was restored to favour, and reinstated in his primacy, when the increasing insolence of his demeanour drew from the King some hasty expressions of indignation, which his servants interpreted into a sentence of proscription, and, trusting that the deed would be grateful to their master, murdered the prelate while in the act of celebrating vespers at the altar [of his ca thedral.] For this shocking action Henry ex-"], [119, "SECT. 15. MODERN HISTORY. 101 pressed the regret which he sincerely felt, and the Pope indulgently granted his pardon, on the assurance of his dutiful obedience to the Holy Church ; [but the power and influence of the clergy were greatly advanced by the King's sub mission : the constitutions of Clarendon, how ever, remained unrepealed.] 5. The most important event of the reign of Henry II. was the conquest of Ireland. The Irish, an early civilised people, and among the first of the nations of the West who embraced the Christian religion, were, by frequent inva- sions of the Danes, and their own domestic com- motions, replunged into barbarism for many ages. In the twelfth century the kingdom con- sisted of five separate sovereignties, Ulster, Leinster, Munster, Meath, and Connaught ; but these were subdivided among an infinite number of petty chiefs, owning a very weak allegiance to their respective sovereigns. Dermot Mac- morrogh, expelled from his kingdom of Lein- ster for a rape on the daughter of the King of Meath, sought protection from Henry, and en gaged to become his feudatory, if he should re cover his kingdom by the aid of the English. Henry, [having fortified himself with a grant from Pope Adrian IV., the most extraordinary h 3"], [120, "102 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. that history has ever recorded,] empowered his subjects to invade Ireland ; and, while Strong bow Earl of Pembroke and his followers were laying waste the country, landed in the island himself in 1172, and received the submission of a great number of the independent chiefs. Ro derick O'Connor, Prince of Connaught, whom the Irish elected nominal sovereign of all the provinces, resisted for three years the arms of Henry, but finally acknowledged his dominion by a solemn embassy to the King at Windsor. The terms of the submission were, an annual tribute of every tenth hide of land, to be applied for the support of government, and an obliga tion of allegiance to the crown of England ; on which conditions the Irish should retain their possessions, and Roderick his kingdom ; except the territory of the Pale, or that part which the English barons had subdued before the arrival of Henry. 6. Henry divided Ireland into counties, ap pointed sheriffs in each, and introduced the laws of England into the territory of the Pale ; the rest of the kingdom being regulated by their ancient laws, till the reign of Edward I., when, at the request of the nation, the English laws were extended to the whole kingdom .; and in"], [121, "SECT. 15. MODERN HISTORY. 103 the first Irish parliament, which was held in the same reign, Sir John Wogan presided as deputy of the sovereign. From that time, for some centuries, there was little intercourse between the kingdoms ; nor was the island considered as fully subdued till the reign of Elizabeth and of her successor James I. 7- The latter part of the reign of Henry II. was clouded by domestic misfortune. His children, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and John, instigated by their unnatural mother, rose in re bellion, and, with the aid of Lewis VII., King of France, prepared to dethrone their father. While opposing them with spirit on the Con tinent, his kingdom was invaded by the Scots under William (the Lyon). He hastened back to England, defeated the Scots, and made their King his prisoner. Two of his sons, Henry and Geoffrey, expiated their offences by an early death ; but Richard, once reconciled, was again seduced from his allegiance, and, in league with the King of France, plundered his father's con tinental dominions. The spirit of Henry was unequal to his domestic misfortunes, and he died of a broken heart in the 58th year of his age, 1189, an ornament to the English throne, and a prince surpassing all his contemporaries in the h 4"], [122, "104 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. valuable qualities of a sovereign. To him Eng land owed her first permanent improvements in arts, in laws, in government, and in civil liberty. 8. Richard I., (C\u0153ur de Lion,) immediately on his accession, embarked for the Holy Land, on a crusade against the infidels, after plundering his subjects of an immense sum of money to de- fray the charges of the enterprise. Forming a league with Philip Augustus of France, the two monarchs joined their forces, and, acting for some time in concert, were successful in the taking of Acra or Ptolemais ; but Philip, jealous of his rival's glory, [and of the superiority of a person whom he could not help regarding as his vassal,] soon returned to France, while Richard had the honour of defeating the heroic Saladin in the battle of Ascalon, with prodigious slaughter of his enemies. He prepared now for the siege of Jerusalem; but, finding his army wasted with famine and fatigue, he was compelled to end the war by a truce with Saladin, in which he obtained a free passage to the Holy Land for every Christian pilgrim. [But he quitted the country with too little care of his own person. Setting sail with a single vessel, he was] wrecked in his voyage homeward, and travelling in dis guise through Germany, [though at enmity with"], [123, "SECT. 15.

The King of France ungenerously opposed his release, as did his unnatural brother John, from selfish ambition ; but he was at length [most liberally] ransomed by his faithful subjects, [whom he had too much neglected,] for the sum of 150,000 merks, and, after an absence of nine years, returned to his dominions. His traitorous brother was pardoned after some submission ; and Richard employed the short residue of his reign in a spirited revenge against his rival, Philip. A truce, however, was concluded, by the medi ation of Rome ; and Richard was soon after killed, while storming the castle of one of his rebellious vassals in the Limosin. He died in the tenth year of his reign, and forty-second of his age, 1199. [It is remarkable, that of the ten years that he reigned he had passed only four months in England: his absence, of course, gave great scope to the nobles to assert their independ ence, which was brought to a crisis in the early part of the reign of'his successor. If not actually beloved, he was certainly greatly admired by his subjects forhis extraordinaryand romantic valour. Richard was one of the royal poets of Provence,"], [124, "106 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. but appears to have been rather inspired by anger than by love.] 9. John (Lackland) succeeded to the throne on the death of his brother, but found a competitor in his nephew Arthur, the son of Geoffrey, sup ported by Philip of France. War was, of course, renewed with that country: but Arthur, with fatal confidence, throwing himself into the hands of his uncle, was removed by poison or the sword; a deed which, joined to the known tyranny of his character, rendered John the detestation of his subjects. [He usurped from Arthur the pro vince of Britany, which, in addition to his father's and brothers dominions, rendered him, in regard to territory, one of the greatest princes of Europe. But] he was stripped by Philip of his continental dominions, and he made the Pope his enemy by an avaricious attack on the treasures of the church. After an ineffectual menace of vengeance, Innocent III. pronounced a sentence of interdict against the kingdom, which put a stop to all the ordinances of religion, to baptism, and the burial of the dead. He next excommunicated John, and absolved his subjects from their allegiance ; and he finally deposed him, and made a gift of the kingdom to Philip ; [who, though he had himself been excommu-"], [125, "SECT. 15.

On these conditions, which insured the universal hatred and con tempt of his people, he made his peace with the church ; [and Philip was forbidden to assert his claim to a kingdom now become a fief of the Roman See, or to proceed against one of the Pope's vassals.] It was natural that his subjects, thus trampled upon and sold, should vindicate their rights. The barons of the kingdom as sembled, and binding themselves by oath to an union of measures, they resolutely demanded from the King a ratification of a charter of privi leges granted by Henry I. John appealed to the Po in support of his vassal, prohibited the coi as the barons as rebellious. These were [not so eastiy checked by the Pope's inter dicts, but became] only the more resolute in their purpose, and the sword was their last resource.

The fines to the over-lord on the succession of vassals were regulated ; 3. No aids or subsi- dies were allowed to be levied from the subject, unless in a few special cases, without the consent of the great council ; 4. The crown shall not seize the lands of a baron for a debt, while he has personal property sufficient to discharge it ; 5.

John granted at the same time the Charta de Foresta, which abolished the royal privilege of killing game over all the kingdom, and re stored to the lawful proprietors their woods and forests, which they were now allowed to enclose and use at their pleasure. As compulsion alone had produced these concessions, John was de termined to disregard them, and a foreign force was brought into the kingdom to reduce the barons into submission. These applied for aid to France, and Philip sent his son Lewis to England with an army ; and such was the peo ple's hatred of their sovereign, that they swore allegiance to this foreigner. At this critical period John died at Newark, 1216, and an in stant change ensued. His son Henry III., a boy of nine years of age, was crowned at Bristol, and his uncle the Earl of Pembroke appointed protector of the realm ; the disaffected barons returned to their allegiance, the people hailed their sovereign, and Lewis with his army, after an ineffectual struggle, made peace with the Protector, and evacuated the kingdom."], [128, "PART II. 110 MODERN HISTORY.

Frederick II., son of Henry VI., was elected Emperor on the resignation of Otho IV., 1212, [and crowned 1220.] At this period Naples, Sicily, and Lombardy, were all appen dages of the empire ; and the contentions be tween the Imperial and Papal powers divided the states of Italy into factions, known by the names [which had originated in Germany under Conrad III.] of Guelphs and Ghibellines ; the former maintaining the supremacy of the Pope, the latter that of the Emperor. [Their contests, according to the fashion of the times, bore the character of crusades, the Emperor's party actu ally bearing on their garments the symbol of the Cross, and the Pope's the Two Keys.] The opposition of Frederick to four successive Popes was avenged by excommunication and deposi tion ; yet he kept possession of his throne, and vindicated his authority with great spirit. [He"], [129, "SECT. 16.

On his death, 1250, the splendour of the empire was for many years obscured. It was a prey to incessant factions and civil war, the fruit of contested claims of sovereignty ; [it was, in fact, without any head till the elevation of the house of Hapsburgh, 1273 ;] yet the Popes gained no thing by its disorders ; for the troubles of Italy were equally hostile to their ambition. We have seen the turbulent state of England ; France was equally weak and anarchical ; Spain ravaged by the contests of the Moors and Christians.

PART II XVII. THE CRUSADES, OR HOLY WARS. 1. The Turks or Turcoman s, a race of Tartars from the regions of Mount Taurus and Imaus, invaded the dominions of Moscovy in the ele venth century, and came down upon the banks of the Caspian. The Caliphs employed Turkish mercenaries ; [in the same manner as the Ro man Emperors before them had employed the Goths and barbarians by whom they were over whelmed ;] and they acquired the reputation of able soldiers in the wars that took place on occasion of the contested Caliphate. The Caliphs of Bagdat, the Abassid\u00e6, were deprived, by their rival Caliphs of the race of Omar, of Syria, Egypt, and Africa ; and the Turks stripped of their dominions both the Abassid\u00e6 and Ommiades. Bagdat was taken by the Turks, and the empire of the Caliphs over thrown, in 1055 ; and these princes, from tem poral monarchs, became now the supreme Pon tiffs of the Mahometan faith, as the Popes of the"], [131, "113 SECT. 17- MODERN HISTORY. Christian. At the time of the first crusade, in the end of the eleventh century, Arabia was governed by a Turkish Sultan, as were Persia and the greater portion of Lesser Asia. The eastern empire was thus abridged of its Asiatic territory, and had lost a great part of its domi nions in Europe. It retained, however, Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, and Illyria ; and Constan tinople itself was populous, opulent, and luxu rious. Palestine was in the possession of the Turks ; and its capital, Jerusalem, fallen from its ancient consequence and splendour, was yet held in respect by its conquerors as a holy city, and constantly attracted the resort of Mahome tans to the mosque of Omar, as of Christian pilgrims to the sepulchre of our Saviour. [Michael VII., the eastern Emperor, stung by the loss of his Asiatic dominions, had, as early as the year 1074, applied to Gregory VII. for assistance to throw off the yoke of the Infidels, but owing to the disputes between that Pontiff and the German emperors, the undertaking was postponed till a fresh occasion presented itself.] 2. Peter the Hermit, a native of Amiens, on his return from a pilgrimage [to Jerusalem,] complained in loud terms of the grievances vol. 11. 1"], [132, "114 PART II- MODERN HISTORY. which the Christians suffered from the Turks ; and Urban II. pitched on this enthusiast as a fit person to commence the execution of a grand design which the Popes had [as has been shown, previously] entertained of arming all Christendom, and exterminating the Infidels from the Holy Land ; [having a double object in this, as it was likely to terminate the schism between the Greek and Latin churches, and extend their authority, by employing the so vereigns and nobles of western Europe, who might be troublesome at home, in distant expe ditions.] The project was opened in two ge neral councils held at Placentia and Clermont. [The first was unsuccessful: the principal lords of Italy had too much to do at home, and were loth to leave their country, for a region so different.] The French possessed more ardour than the Italians ; and an immense multitude of ambitious and disorderly nobles, with all their dependants, eager for enterprise and plun der, and assured of eternal salvation, [by one of the most extraordinary indulgences ever issued by the Papal court,] immediately took the cross. Peter the Hermit led 80,000 under his banners, [princes, prelates, nobles, monks, women, and children, \" totumque vulgus, tarn casti quam in-"], [133, "SECT. 17. 115 MODERN HISTORY. \" cesti,\" as a contemporary writer sums up the account;] and they began their march to wards the East in 1095. Their progress was marked by rapine and hostility in every Chris tian country through which they passed ; [as might reasonably have been expected from such a concourse of persons, who were taught to suppose, that every thing was permitted, where every thing was to be pardoned ;] and the army of the Hermit, on its arrival at Constantinople, was wasted down to 20,000. The Emperor Alexius Comnenus, to whom the crusaders behaved with the most provoking insolence and folly, conducted himself with admirable moder ation and good sense. He hastened to get rid of this disorderly multitude, by furnishing them with every aid which they required, and cheer fully lent his ships to transport them across the Bosphorus. The Sultan Solyman met them on the plain of Nicea, and cut to pieces the army of the Hermit. A new host, in the mean time, arrived at Constantinople, led by more illustrious commanders ; by Godfrey of Bouillon Duke of Brabant, Raymond Count of Thoulouse, Robert of Normandy, son of William King of England, Bohemond, son of Robert Guiscard, the con queror of Sicily, and other princes of high 1 9. 1 i-\u00bb"], [134, "116 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. reputation. To these, who amounted to some hundred thousands, Alexius manifested the same prudent conduct, to accelerate their departure ; [and with good reason, since it was evidently the wish of many of them to begin the crusade with the seizure of the eastern capital.] The Turks, overpowered by numbers, were twice defeated, and the crusaders, pursuing their suc cesses, penetrated at length to Jerusalem, which, after a siege of six weeks, they took by storm, and with savage fury massacred the whole of its Mahometan and Jewish inhabitants, A.D. 1099 [The Hermit lived to see the capture of the sacred city, but Urban II. died before this great object of the expedition was accomplished.] God frey was hailed King of Jerusalem, but was obliged soon after to cede his kingdom to the Pope's legate, [who had been nominated Patriarch by the clergy.] The crusaders divided Syria and Palestine, and formed four separate states, which weakened their power. The Turks began to recover strength ; and the Christian states of Asia soon found it necessary to solicit aid from Europe. 3. The second crusade set out from the West in 1146, to the amount of 200,000, French, Germans, and Italians, led by Hugh, brother to"], [135, "SECT. 17- MODERN HISTORY. 117 Philip I. of France. These met with the same fate which attended the army of Peter the Her mit. [Those who landed in Asia were roughly handled by the Sultan Solyman, and Prince Hugh died almost deserted.] The garrison of Jerusalem was at this time so weak, that it be came necessary to embody and arm the monks for its defence ; and hence arose the military orders of the Knights Templars and Hospital lers, and soon after the Teutonic, from the German pilgrims. Meantime Pope Eugenius III. employed St. Bernard, [whose disciple he had been, a man so highly endowed as to be called the oracle of Europe,] to preach up a new crusade in France, which was headed by its so vereign Louis VII., (the Young), who, in con junction with Conrad III., Emperor of Ger many, mustered jointly 300,000 men. [Both princes had received the red cross from the hands of St. Bernard.] The Germans were cut to pieces by the Sultan of Iconium ; the French were totally defeated near Laodicea ; and the two monarchs, after much disaster, returned with shame to their dominions. [A thousand desolate families, with too much reason, inveigh ing bitterly against St. Bernard, who had the assurance to compare himself with Moses, who, i 3"], [136, "118 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. after promising to lead the Israelites into a happy country, saw the first generation perish in the wilderness.] 4. The illustrious Saladin, nephew of the Sultan of Egypt, formed the design of recover ing Palestine from the Christians ; and besieging Jerusalem, [then a prey to factions and disorders of all kinds,] he took the city, and made pri soner its sovereign, Guy of Lusignan, [whom he treated kindly.] Pope Clement III., alarmed at the successes of the Infidels, began to stir up a new crusade from France, England, and Ger many ; and the armies of each country were headed by their respective sovereigns, Philip Augustus, Richard I., and Frederick Barbarossa. In this third crusade the Emperor Frederick died in Asia, [by imprudent bathing,] and his army, by repeated defeats, mouldered to nothing. The English and French were more successful : they besieged and took Ptolemais, [A.D. 1190 ;] but Richard and Philip quarrelled from jealousy of each other's glory, and the French monarch returned in disgust to his country. Richard nobly sustained the contest with Saladin, whom he defeated near Ascalon ; but his army was reduced by famine and fatigue ; and concluding a treaty, at least not dishonourable, with his"], [137, "SEPT. 17. 119 MODERN HISTORY. enemy, he was forced at length to escape from Palestine with a single ship. (See supra, Sect. XV. \u00a7 8.) Saladin, revered even by the Christians, died 1195. 5. A fourth crusade was fitted out in 1202, under Baldwin Count of Flanders, of which the object was not the extirpation of the Infidels, but the destruction of the empire of the East. Constantinople, embroiled by civil war and re volution, from disputed claims to the sovereignty, was besieged and taken by the crusaders ; [little resistance being made to them;] and Baldwin, their chief, was elected Emperor, to be within a few months dethroned and murdered. The Imperial dominions were shared among the principal leaders ; and the Venetians, who had lent their ships for the expedition, got the Isle of Candia (anciently Crete) for their reward. Alexius, of the Imperial family of the Comneni, founded a new sovereignty in Asia, which he termed the Empire of Trebizond. The object of a fifth crusade was to lay waste Egypt, in revenge for an attack on Palestine by its Sultan Saphadin. Partial success and ultimate ruin was the issue of this expedition, as of all the preceding. 6. At this period, 1227, a great revolution 1 4"], [138, "PART H. 120 MODERN HISTORY. took place in Asia. Gengiskan with his Tartars broke down from the North upon Persia and Syria, and massacred indiscriminately Turks, Jews, and Christians, who opposed them. The Christian Knights Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic, made a desperate but ineffectual re sistance ; and Palestine must have been aban doned to these invaders, had not its fate been for a while retarded by the last crusade under Lewis IX. of France. This prince, summoned, as he believed, by Heaven, after four years' pre paration, set out for the Holy Land, with his Queen, his three brothers, and all the Knights of France. His army began their enterprise by an attack on Egypt, where, after some consider able successes, they were at length utterly de feated, and the French monarch, with two of his brothers, [one having perished in the field,] fell into the hands of the enemy. He purchased his liberty at an immense ransom, [though through the extraordinary forbearance of the enemy, not so great as was at first offered ;] and, returning to France, reigned prosperously and wisely for thirteen years. [For, as it has been justly enough observed, his piety, which was that of an anchoret, did not deprive him of any of the virtues of a king, could he but have been per-"], [139, "SECT. 17. 121 MODERN HISTORY. suaded to stay more at home.] But the same phrenzy again assailing him, he embarked on a crusade against the Moors in Africa, where his army was destroyed by a pestilence, and he himself became its victim, 1270. It is com puted that, in the whole of the crusades to Palestine, two millions of Europeans were buried in the East. [Two transitory sovereignties in deed were established in the East by the Latins; of which that of Jerusalem was acquired in the third year of the crusades, and retained during eighty-eight years ; and after an interval of forty-one, re-acquired, lasting fifteen. The Latin empire endured fifty-seven years.] 7- Effects os' the Crusades. \u2014 One consequence of the holy wars is supposed to have been the improvement of European manners ; but the times immediately succeeding the crusades ex hibit no such actual improvement. Two cen turies of barbarism and darkness elapsed between the termination of those enterprises and the fall of the Greek empire in 1453, the \u00e6ra of the revival of letters, and the commencement of civilisation. A certain consequence of the cru sades was the change of territorial property in many of the feudal kingdoms, the sale of the estates ot' the nobles, and their division among a"], [140, "122 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. number of smaller proprietors. [In France this tended considerably to the advancement of the kingly power, but in Germany, whose sovereigns had, in the crusades been personally engaged, but with ill success, the nobles obtained advan- tages over the crown. In the former case, however,] the feudal aristocracy was weakened, and the lower classes began to acquire weight, and a spirit of independence. The towns, hitherto bound by a sort of vassalage to the nobles, began to purchase their immunity, ac- quired the right of electing their own magistrates, and were governed by their own municipal laws. [Some even went so far as to emancipate them- selves without waiting for the authority of a charter, and by pleading, after a time, prescrip- tion against the nobles, artfully drove the latter to a proof of their rights of superiority.] The church in some respects gained, and in others lost, by those enterprises. The Popes gained a more extended jurisdiction ; but the fatal issue of those expeditions opened the eyes of the world to the selfish and interested motives which had prompted them, and weakened the sway of superstition. Many of the religious orders ac quired an increase of wealth ; but this was ba lanced by the taxes imposed on the clergy."], [141, "SECT. 17- MODERN HISTORY. 123 The coin was altered and debased in most of the kingdoms of Europe, from the scarcity of specie. The Jews were supposed to have hoarded and concealed it, and they became hence the victims of general persecution. The most substantial gainers by the crusades were the Italian states of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice, from the increased trade to the Levant for the supply of those immense armies. Venice, as we have seen, took an active concern, and ob tained her share of the conquered territory. [8. The good effects of the crusades may, therefore, perhaps, be thus summed up ; that they brought into activity, earlier possibly than would otherwise have been the case, many good principles, and eradicated many bad ones ; while the commercial advances made by the cities above mentioned were instrumental, though not very rapidly, to the improvement of the whole of western Europe. In regard to literature, and any intellectual advantages, it is but too probable that the Latins destroyed in the eastern capital many treasures of this nature, whose loss is quite irreparable.] The age of the crusades brought chivalry to its perfection, and gave rise to romantic fiction."], [142, "124 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. XVIII. OF CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE. 1. Chivalry arose naturally from the condi tion of society in those ages in which it prevailed. Among the Germanic nations, the profession of arms was esteemed the sole employment that deserved the name of manly or honourable. The initiation of the youth to this profession was attended with peculiar solemnity and appro priate ceremonies. The chief of the tribe be stowed the sword and armour on his vassal, as a symbol of their being devoted to his service. In the progress of the feudal system, these vassals, in imitation of their chief, assumed the power of conferring arms on their sub-vassals, with a similar form of mysterious and pompous ceremonial. The candidate for knighthood un derwent his preparatory fasts and vigils, and received on his knees the accollade and benedic tion of his chief. Armed and caparisoned, he sallied forth in quest of adventure, which, whe-"], [143, "SECT. 18. MODERN HISTORY. 125 ther just or not in its purpose, was ever esteemed honourable in proportion as it was perilous. 2. The high esteem of the female sex is cha racteristic of the Gothic manners ; [but there can be little doubt that the knowledge of Chris tianity first introduced those elevated sentiments towards the sex, which have, ever since, conduced to render them the ornaments of society, and in every respect the objects of manly protection. It has, indeed, been suggested,^that the exaltation of the female character, jointly with the religious rites of chivalry, are to be attributed to the su perstitious veneration paid by the Roman church to the Virgin Mother of our Lord, and which appears to have been carried to its greatest height in the tenth century, the very age pre ceding the rise of chivalry. In the famous vow of chivalry, and the knight's oath, the Virgin is expressly introduced between the Creator and the ladies, the leading objects of all chivalrous enterprizes.] In the ages of bar barism, the castles of the greater barons were in miniature the courts of sovereigns. The society of the ladies, who found only in such fortresses a security from outrage, polished the manners ; and to protect the chastity and honour of the fair was the best employ and highest merit of an ac-"], [144, "126 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. complished knight. Romantic exploit had, therefore, always a tincture of gallantry : It hath been through all ages ever seen, That with the praise of arms and chivalry The prize of beauty still hath joined been, And that for reasons special privity ; For either doth on other much rely ; For he, me seems, most 6t the fair to serve, That can her best defend from villany ; And she most fit his service doth deserve That fairest is, and from her faith will never swerve. Spenser's Fairy Queen. [France might, as is generally allowed, have been the cradle of chivalry ; but as it appears to have passed from thence into Spain, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the gallantry of the system may have received great additions, and been \" sublimated,\" as an able writer ob serves, by the ardency of the more southern imaginations of the Moors and Arabians.] 3. To the passion for adventure and romantic love were added very high ideas of morality and religion ; but, as the latter were ever subordinate to the former, we may presume more in favour of their refinement than of their purity. It was the pride of a knight to redress wrongs and injuries ; but in that honourable employ ment he made small account of those he com-"], [145, "SECT. 18. 127 MODERN HISTORY. mitted ; and it was easy to expiate the greatest offences by a penance or a pilgrimage, which furnished only a new opportunity for adventur ous exploit. [Nevertheless, it should perhaps be added, that chivalry had its periods in which it approached more or less to a perfect purity of principles. It is upon record that, before the fourteenth century, knights were not only obliged by oath to give protection to distressed females, but publicly to discountenance and put to shame any of tainted reputations, who should presume to appear in the assemblies of those who were of unblemished characters. That the pro fession had indeed in various ways actually pro moted both private and public virtue is to be concluded from the disposition manifested by so vereign princes in subsequent and more en lightened times, to revive the spirit of it in the rules and obligations of all the modern orders of knighthood.] 4. Chivalry, whether it began with the Moors or Normans, attained its perfection at the period of the crusades, which presented a noble object of adventure, and a boundless field for military glory. Few, it is true, returned from those desperate enterprises, but those few had a high reward in the admiration of their countrymen."], [146, "128 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. The bards and romancers sung their praises, and recorded their exploits, with a thousand circum stances of fabulous embellishment. [The dis covery of gunpowder and modern artillery, by depriving the armed and caparisoned knight of his principal advantages, put an end to the sys tem and all its peculiarities.] 5. The earliest of the old romances (so termed from the Romance language, a mixture of the Frank and Latin, in which they were written,) appeared about the middle of the twelfth cen tury, the period of the second crusade. But those more ancient compositions did not record contemporary events, whose known truth would have precluded all liberty of fiction or exagger ation. Geoffrey of Monmouth, and the author who assumed the name of Archbishop Turpin, had free scope to their fancy, by celebrating the deeds of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and the exploits of Charlemagne and his Twelve Peers ; and from the fruitful stock of those first romances sprung a numerous offspring, equally wild and extravagant. 6. Philosophers have analysed the pleasure arising from works of fiction, and have en deavoured, by various hypotheses, to account for the interest we take in the description of an event"], [147, "SECT. 18. 129 MODERN HISTORY. or scene which we know to be utterly impossible. We may account thus simply for the pheno menon : every narration is in some degree at tended with a dramatic deception. We enter for the time into the situation of the persons con cerned. Adopting their passions and their feel ings, we lose for a moment all sense of the ab surdity of their cause whilst we see the agents themselves hold it for reasonable and adequate. The most incredulous sceptic may sympathise strongly with the feelings of Hamlet at the sight of his father's spectre. 7. Thus powerfully affected as we are by sym pathy, even against the conviction of our reason, how much greater must have been the effect of such works of the imagination in those days, when popular superstition gave full credit to the reality, or at least the possibility, of all that they described ! And hence we must censure, as both unnecessary and improbable, that theory of Dr. Hurd, which accounts for all the wildness of the old romances, on the supposition that their fictions were entirely allegorical; which explains the giants and savages into the op pressive feudal lords and their barbarous de pendants ; as M. Mallet construes the serpents and dragonS which guarded the enchanted VOL. II. K"], [148, "130 PART II. MODERN HTSTORY. castles into their winding walls, fosses, and bat tlements. It were sufficient to say, that many of those old romances are inexplicable by alle gory. They were received by tire popular belief as truths, and even their contrivers believed in the possibility of the scenes and actions they described. [A very curious proof of this may be found in the recorded vision of a monk of Monte Cassino, in the very beginning of the twelfth century, who pretended to have actually seen things so similar to the subsequent imaginary representations of Dante, as to have subjected the latter, in our own times, to the charge of plagiarism. But the vision of the monk was, by his credulous contemporaries, believed to be real in all its circumstances. \" Ut p\u0153nas peccatorum perspexisse, et pertimuisse, et gloriam sanctorum vidisse nemo quis dabitet,\" are the very words of Peter the deacon, who wrote the history of the vision at the time.] In latter ages, and in the wane of superstition, yet while it still retained a powerful influence, the poets adopted allegory as a vehicle of moral instruction ; and to this period belong those poetical romances which bear an allegorical explanation ; as, the Fairy Queen of Spenser, the Orlando of Ariosto, and the Gierusalemme Liberata of Tasso. io\u00bb"], [149, "SECT. 19. MODERN HISTORY. 131 8. In more modern times the taste for ro mantic composition declined with popular cre dulity ; and the fastidiousness of philosophy af fected to treat all supernatural fiction with con tempt. But it was at length perceived that this refinement had cut off a source of very high mental enjoyment. The public taste now took a new turn ; and this moral revolution is at present tending to its extreme. We are gone back to the nursery to listen to tales of hob goblins ; a change which we may safely prog nosticate can be of no long duration. XIX. STATE OF EUROPE IN THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES. 1. Constantinople, taken in 1202 by the crusaders, was possessed only for a short time by its conquerors. It was governed by French [or Latin] emperors [as they were called, to distinguish them from the Grecian dynasty,] for the space of almost sixty years, being retaken by the Greeks, in 1261, under Michael Pal\u00e6o logus, who, by imprisoning and putting out the k 2"], [150, "132 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. eyes of his pupil Theodore Lascaris, secured to himself the sovereignty. 2. Germany was governed in the beginning of the thirteenth century by [a sovereign of no mean talents, and even of considerable literary fame for the times in which he lived,] Fre- derick II., who paid homage to the Pope for the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, possessed by his son Conrad, and afterwards by his natural son Manfred, who usurped the crown, in vio- lation of the right of his nephew Conradin. Pope Clement IV., jealous of the dominion of the Imperial family, [in the south of Italy,] gave the investiture of Naples and Sicily to Charles of Anjou, brother of Lewis IX. of France, who defeated and put to death his com- petitor [Manfred, but tarnished his fame greatly by suffering the true heir, the young and high- spirited Conradin, to be publicly executed, to which he is said to have been particularly insti- gated by the Pope; but of this there seems to be some doubt: at all events, however, the Pope had no right, in displacing an usurper, to dis possess the right and true heir, which Conradin undoubtedly was.] The Sicilians revenged this act of usurpation and cruelty by the murder, in one night, of every Frenchman in the island."], [151, "SECT. 19- 133 MODERN HISTORY. This shocking massacre, termed the Sicilian Vespers, happened on Easter Sunday, 1282. It was followed by every evil that comes in the train of civil war and revolution. 3. The beginning of the thirteenth century had been signalised by a new species of crusade. The Albigenses, inhabitants of Alby, in the Pays de Vaud, were bold enough to dispute many of the tenets of the Catholic church, as judging them contrary to the doctrines of Scripture. Innocent III. established a holy commission at Thoulouse, with power to try and punish these heretics. The Count of Thoulouse opposed this persecution, and was, for the punishment of his offence, compelled by the Pope to assist in a crusade against his own vassals. Simon de Montfort was the leader of this pious enterprise, which was marked by the most atrocious cruel ties. The benefits of the holy commission were judged by the Popes to be so great, that it be came from that time a permanent establishment, known by the name of the Inquisition, [and was set up in various parts of Europe, all over Italy, the kingdom of Naples excepted, in Spain, and in Portugal.] 4. The rise of the house of Austria may be dated from 127S, when Rodolphus of Haps- k 3"], [152, "134 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. bourg, a Swiss baron, was elected Emperor of Germany. He owed his elevation to the jea- lousies of the electoral princes, who could not agree in the choice of any one of themselves. The King of Bohemia, to whom Rodolphus had been steward of the household, could ill brook the supremacy of his former dependant ; and refusing him the customary homage for his Germanic possessions, Rodolphus stripped him of Austria, which has ever since remained in the family of its conqueror. 5. The Italian states of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, were at this time flourishing and opulent, while most of the kingdoms of Europe (if we except England under Edward I.) were ex- hausted, feeble, and disorderly. A dawning of civil liberty began to appear in France under Philip IV. (le Bel), who summoned the third estate to the national assemblies, which had hitherto consisted of the nobility and clergy, 1303. It was the same prince who established perpetual courts of judicature in France, under the name of Parliaments. Over these the par liament of Paris possessed a jurisdiction by appeal ; but it was not till latter times that it assumed any authority in matters of state. 6. The parliament of England had before this"], [153, "SECT. 19- 135 MODERN HISTORY. \u00e6ra begun to assume its present constitution. The Commons, or the representatives of counties and boroughs, were first called to parliament by Henry III. : before that time, this assembly consisted only of the greater barons and clergy. But of the rise and progress of the constitution of England we shall afterwards treat more par ticularly in a separate section. 7. The spirit of the popedom, zealous in the maintenance and extension of its prerogatives, continued much the same in the thirteenth and fourteenth, as we have seen it in the three pre ceding centuries, [except meeting with some serious resistance in France early in the latter 01 end of the former.] Philip the Fair had sub jected his clergy to bear their share of the public taxes, and prohibited all contributions to be levied by the Pope in his dominions. This double offence was highly resented [by the cele brated Cajetan,] Boniface VIII., [who in the year 1294 ascended the papal throne at the ad vanced age of seventy-seven, possessing, without the talents, all the pride and obstinacy of Hilde brand.] The angry Pontiff expressed his in dignation [against Philip] by a sentence of excommunication and interdict, and a solemn transference of the kingdom of France to the k 4"], [154, "136 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Emperor Albert. Philip, in revenge, [being supported by his subjects, made many solemn complaints against Boniface, confirmed publicly upon oath, charging him with profligacy, heresy, sorcery, and even murder, and demanding a fresh election,] sent his general Nogaret to Rome, who threw the Pope into prison. The French, however, were [this time] overpowered by the Papal troops, [and Boniface delivered ; but being soon after seised with a delirium, his death] put an end to the quarrel, [in the year 1303.] 8. It is less easy to justify the conduct of Philip the Fair to the Knights Templars than his behaviour to Pope Boniface. The whole of this order had incurred his resentment, from sus- picion of harbouring treasonable designs. He- had influence with Clement V. to procure a Papal bull, warranting their extirpation from all the Christian kingdoms ; and this infamous pro- scription was carried into effect all over Europe, [though France was the only country in which they were put to death.] These unfortunate men were solemnly tried, not for their real offence, but for pretended impieties and idola trous practices, and committed to the flames, 1309\u20141312."], [155, "SECT. 20. 137 MODERN HISTORY. XX. REVOLUTION OF SWITZERLAND. 1. The beginning of the fourteenth century Was distinguished by the revolution of Switzer land, and the rise of the Helvetic republic. The Emperor Rodolphus of Hapsbourg, [advanced to the German throne in the year 1273, see last sections] was hereditary sovereign of several of the Swiss cantons, and governed his states with much equity and moderation ; but his [son and] successor Albert, a tyrannical prince, [and on that account excluded from the immediate suc cession to the German crown,] formed the design of annexing the whole of the provinces to his dominion, and erecting them into a principality for one of his sons. The cantons of Schewitz, Ury, and Underwald, which had always resisted the authority of Austria, [and been particularly distinguished by Rodolph,] combined to assert their freedom ; and a small army of 400 or 500 men defeated an immense host of the Austrians in the pass of Morgate, 1315, [eight years after their solemn confederation.] The rest of the cantons by slow degrees joined the association,"], [156, "138 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. and with invincible perseverance, after sixty pitched battles with their enemies, they won and secured their dear-bought liberty. [The three forest or rural cantons have been mentioned. Lucern was admitted into the confederacy in 1332; Zurich, 1351 ; Glaris, Zug, and Berne, 1352 ; Friburgh and Soleure, 1481 ; Basle and Shaffhausen, 1501 ; and Appenzel, 1513.] 2. Constitution of Switzerland. \u2014 The thirteen cantons were united by a solemn treaty, which stipulated the proportional succours to be fur- nished by each in the case of foreign hostility, and the measures to be followed for securing the union of the states, and accommodating domestic differences. With respect to its internal govern- ment and economy, each canton was independ- ent. Of some, the constitution was monarchical, and of others, republican. All matters touching the general league were transacted either by letters sent to Zurich, and thence officially cir- culated to all the cantons, or by conferences. The general diet, where two deputies attended from each canton, was held once a-year, the first deputy of Zurich presiding. The Catholic and Protestant cantons likewise held their separate diets on occasional emergencies. 3. The Swiss, when at peace, employed their"], [157, "SECT. 21. 139 MODERN HISTORY. troops for hire in foreign service, judging it a wise policy to keep alive the military spirit of the nation ; and the armies thus employed have been equally distinguished for their courage and fidelity. The industry and economy of the Swiss are proverbial ; and their country supports a most abundant population, from the zealous pro motion of agriculture and manufactures. XXI. STATE OF EUROPE (CONTINUED) IN THE THIR- TEENTH, FOURTEENTH, AND PART OF THE FIF- TEENTH CENTURIES. 1 . The rival claims of superiority between the Popes and Emperors still continued. Henry VII., the successor of Albert, vindicated his right by the sword, triumphantly fought his way to Rome, where he was solemnly crowned, [not by the Pope, indeed, but by three of the cardinals,] and imposed a tribute on all the states of Italy, [declaring, at the time of his coronation, that the oath he took was not an oath of allegiance.] His sudden death [A.D. 1313,] was suspected to be the consequence of Papal resentment. It"], [158, "140 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. was in his time that the seat of the Popedom was transferred by Clement V. from Rome to Avignon, 1309, where it remained till 1377. [Clement was a good deal influenced, no doubt, by Philip the Fair, whose subject he was, and to whom he stood indebted for his advancement to the pontifical chair.] The factions of Italy were, however, the chief cause of this removal. Lewis of Bavaria, the successor of Henry, de prived and excommunicated by John XXII., [after submitting unnecessarily to many humi liations and indignities, highly revolting to the princes of the empire,] revenged himself by deposing the Pope. This Pontiff surpassed the most of his predecessors in pride and tyranny. He kept his seat on the Papal chair, [having humbled his competitor, Nicholas V.] and left at his death an immense treasure, accumulated by the sale of benefices, while his rival, the Emperor, died in indigence. 2. His successor in the empire, Charles IV., [King of Bohemia, in right of his mother,] pub lished, in 1355, the Imperial constitution, termed The Golden Bull, the fundamental law of the Germanic body, which reduced the number of electors to seven, [Charles himself as King of Bohemia being one,] settled on them al Mie"], [159, "SECT. 21. 141 MODERN HISTORY. hereditary offices of state, [and imprudently placed in their hands the whole power of the empire.] These exemplified their new rights, by deposing his son Wenceslaus, [after he had reigned twenty-two years,] for incapacity, 1400, [principally through the enmity of one of the two Popes who then divided the church, and who stirred up the ecclesiastical electors to get him removed, upon frivolous, and in some in stances, egregiously false charges. Wenceslaus was succeeded by Robert, the Elector Palatine, who reigned only ten years.] Three separate factions of the French and Italian cardinals having elected three separate Popes, the Em peror Sigismund, [brother of Wenceslaus, and King of Hungary, who had succeeded Robert, 1410,] judged this division of the church to be a fit opportunity for his interference, to recon cile all differences, and establish his own su premacy. He summoned a general council at Constance, 1414, [a former one at Pisa having failed to do any good,] and ended the dispute, by degrading all the three Pontiffs, and naming a fourth, Martin Colonna. This division of the Papacy is termed the great schism of the West. 3. The spiritual business of the council of Constance was no less important than its tern-"], [160, "142 MODERN HISTORY. PART'IL poral. John Huss, a disciple of Wicklifi; [and professor in the new university of Prague, founded by Charles IV.] was tried for heresy, in denying the hierarchy, and satirising the im- moralities of the popes and bishops. He did not deny the charge ; and refusing to confess his errors, was burnt alive, [though he had a safe-conduct from the Emperor to appear at the council. But the principle upon which the council acted was not concealed : it was indeed openly avowed, that in certain cases, faith was not to be kept with heretics.] A similar fate was the portion of his friend and disciple, Jerome of Prague, who displayed at his execution the eloquence of an apostle, and the constancy of a martyr, 1416. Sigismund felt the consequence of these horrible proceedings ; for the Bohe- mians, [justly exasperated at the treacherous execution of their countrymen,] opposed his succession to their crown, [vacant by the death of his deceased brother Wenceslaus,] and it cost him a war of sixteen years to attain it. 4. Whatever was the Imperial power at this time, it derived but small consequence from its actual revenues. The wealth of the Germanic states was exclusively possessed by their separate sovereigns, and the Emperor had little more"], [161, "SECT. 22. 143 MODERN HISTORY. than what he drew from Bohemia and Hungary. The sovereignty of Italy was an empty title. The interest of the Emperor in that country furnished only a source of faction to its princes, and embroiled the states in perpetual quarrels. A series of conspiracies and civil tumults form, for above 200 years, the annals of the principal cities. Naples and Sicily were ruined by the weak and disorderly government of the two Joannas. A passion which the younger of these conceived for a soldier of the name of Sforza raised him to the sovereignty of Milan; and her adoption, first of Alphonso of Arragon, and afterwards of Lewis of Anjou, laid the founda tion of those contests between Spain and France for the sovereignty of the Two Sicilies, which afterwards agitated all Europe.

PART II. dispositions, but of weak understanding. [Dur ing the short time that the Earl of Pembroke acted as Regent, from 1216 to 1219, steps seemed to be taking, with some success, to re concile the people to the government of the young King; but after the death of that Earl,] Henry's preference for foreign favourites, [in troduced into the kingdom first by the Bishop of Winchester, a Poictevin, successor of the Earl of Pembroke; secondly, through his Queen, a daughter of the Count of Provence ; thirdly, from Gascony, where his mother had married a second husband; and, lastly, by the Pope, who had filled the church with his Italians,] disgusted his nobles ; and the want of economy in his govern ment, and oppressive exactions, deprived him of the affection of his people. Montfort, Earl of Leicester, son of the leader of the crusade against the Albigenses, and brother-in-law of the King, conceived a plan for usurping the government; and, forming a league with the barons, on the pretext of reforming abuses, compelled Henry to delegate all the regal power into the hands of twenty-four of their number, [twelve to be nominated by the King, and twelve by themselves.] These divided among them the offices of government, and new-mo- 6*"], [163, "SECT. 22. 145 -MODERN HISTORY. defied the parliament, by summoning a certain number of knights chosen from each county, a measure fatal to their own power ; for these representatives of the people, indignant at Lei- cester's usurpation, determined to restore the royal authority ; and they called on Prince Edward, a youth of intrepid spirit, to avenge his father's wrongs, and save the kingdom. 2. Leicester raised a formidable force, and, in a successful engagement, at Lewes, in Sussex, 1264, defeated the royal army, and made both the King and Prince his prisoners. He now compelled the impotent Henry to ratify his authority by a solemn treaty ; and, assuming the character of Regent, he called a parliament, summoning two knights from each of the coun ties, and deputies from the principal boroughs, the first regular plan of the English House of Commons. This assembly exercising its just rights, and asserting with firmness the re-estab lishment of the ancient government of the king dom, Leicester judged it prudent to release the Prince from his confinement ; and Edward was no sooner at liberty than he took the field against the usurper, who, in the battle of Evesham, 4th August, 1265, was defeated and slain. Henry was now restored to his throne by the vol. n. i"], [164, "146 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. arms of his gallant son, who, after establishing domestic tranquillity, embarked in the last cru sade with Lewis IX., and signalised his prowess by many valorous exploits in Palestine. He had the honour of concluding an advantageous truce for ten years with the Sultan of Babylon ; and was on his return to England when he re ceived intelligence of his accession to the crown by the death of his father, 1272. 3. Edward I., in the beginning of his reign, projected the conquest of Wales. The Welsh, the descendants of the ancient Britons who had escaped the Roman and Saxon conquests, pre served their liberty, their laws, their manners, and their language. Their Prince, Lewellyn, [who had sided with the malcontents during the preceding reign,] refusing his customary homage, Edward invaded Wales, and surround ing the army of the Prince, who retreated to the mountains, cut off all his supplies, and com pelled him to an unqualified submission. The terms demanded were, the surrender of a part of the country, a large sum of money, and an obligation of perpetual fealty to the crown of England. The Welsh infringed this treaty ; and Edward marched his army into the heart of the country, where the troops of Lewellyn !*\u25a0"], [165, "SECT. 22. 147 MODERN HISTORY. made a most desperate but ineffectual resistance. In a decisive engagement, in 1283, the Prince was slain. His brother David, betrayed into the hand of the conqueror, was inhumanly exe cuted on a gibbet ; and Wales, completely sub dued, was annexed to the crown of England. With a policy equally absurd and cruel, Edward ordered the Welsh bards to be put to death wherever found ; thereby insuring the perpetua tion of their heroic songs, and increasing the abhorrence of the vanquished people for their barbarous conqueror. 4. The conquest of Wales inflamed the am bition of Edward, and inspired him with the design of extending his dominion to the extre mity of the island. The designs of this enter prising monarch on the kingdom of Scotland invite our attention to that quarter; but pre viously require a short retrospect to its earlier history. l 2"], [166, "148 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. XXIII. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. 1. The history of Scotland, before the reign of Malcolm III., surnamed Canmore, is obscure from the deficiency of historical records. This Prince, by the defeat of Macbeth, the murderer of his father Duncan, succeeded to the throne in 1057 ; and espousing the cause of Edgar Atheling, heir of the Saxon kings of England, whose sister he married, he thus provoked a war with William the Conqueror, which was equally prejudicial to both kingdoms. In an expedition of Mal colm into England, it is alleged that, after con cluding a truce, he was compelled by William to do homage for his kingdom. The truth is, that this homage was done for the territories in Cum berland and Northumberland won by the Scots, and held in vassalage of the English crown, though this homage was afterwards absurdly made the pretext of a claim of feudal sovereignty over all Scotland. In a reign of twenty-seven 9*"], [167, "sect. 23. 149 MODERN HISTORY. years, Malcolm supported a spirited contest with England, both under William I. and his son Rufus ; and to the virtues of his Queen, Mar garet, his kingdom, in its domestic policy, owed a degree of civilisation remarkable in those ages of barbarism. 2. Alexander L, his son and successor, de fended, with equal spirit and good policy, the independence of his kingdom ; and his son David L, celebrated even by the democratic Buchanan, as an honour to his country and to monarchy, won from Stephen, and annexed to his crown, the whole earldom of Northumber land. In those reigns we hear of no claim of the feudal subjection of Scotland to the crown of England ; though the accidental fortune of war afterwards furnished a ground for it. Wil liam I. (the Lyon,) taken prisoner at Alnwick by Henry II., was compelled, as the price of his release, to do homage for his whole kingdom ; an obligation which his successor Richard vo luntarily discharged, as deeming it to have been unjustly extorted. 3. On the death of Alexander III., without male issue, in 1285, Bruce and Baliol, de scendants of David I. by the female line, were competitors for the crown, and the pretensions l 3"], [168, "150 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. of each were supported by a formidable party in the kingdom. Edward I. of England, chosen umpire of the contest, arrogated to himself, in that character, the feudal sovereignty of the kingdom, compelling all the barons to swear al legiance to him, and taking actual possession of the country by his troops. He then adjudged the crown to Baliol, on the express condition of his swearing fealty to him as lord paramount. Baliol, however, soon after renouncing his alle giance, the indignant Edward invaded Scotland with an immense force, and compelled the weak prince to abdicate the throne, and resign the kingdom into his hands. 4. William Wallace, one of the greatest heroes whom history records, restored the fallen ho nours of his country. Joined by a few patriots, his first successes in attacking the English gar risons brought numbers to his patriotic standard. Their successes were signal and conspicuous ; victory followed upon victory ; and while Ed ward was engaged on the Continent, his troops were utterly defeated in a desperate engagement at Stirling, and forced to evacuate the kingdom. Wallace, the deliverer of his country, now as sumed the title of Governor of Scotland under Baliol, who was Edward's prisoner ; a distinc tion which was followed by the envy and disaf-"], [169, "SECT. 23. 151 MODERN HISTORY. section of many of the nobles, and the conse quent diminution of his army. The Scots were defeated at Falkirk. Edward returned with a vast accession of force ; and, after a fruitless resistance, the Scottish barons finally obtained peace by a capitulation, from which the brave Wallace was excepted by name. A fugitive for some time, he was betrayed into the hands of Edward, who put him to death with every cir cumstance of cruelty that barbarous revenge could dictate, 1304. 5. Scotland found a second champion and de liverer in Robert Bruce, the grandson of the competitor with Baliol ; who, deeply resenting the humiliation of his country, once more set up the standard of war, and gave defiance to the English monarch, to whom his father and grandfather had meanly sworn allegiance. Under this intrepid leader the spirit of the nation was roused at once : the English were attacked in every quarter, and once more entirely driven out of the kingdom. Robert Bruce was crowned king at Scone, 1306 ; and Edward, advancing with an immense army, died at Carlisle, 7th July, 1307, enjoining it with his last breath to his son Edward II. to prosecute the war with the Scots to the entire reduction of the country. l 4"], [170, "152 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. XXIV. HISTORY OF ENGLAND IN THE FOURTEENTH CEN- TURY. 1. In the reign of Edward I. we observe the constitution of England gradually advancing. The Commons had been admitted to Parliament in the latter period of his father, Henry III. ; [and the son, fortunately for the kingdom, found it necessary, in order to balance the power of the barons, to give as much weight as he could to the members of the lower house of assembly.] A statute was passed by Edward, which declared, that no tax or impost should be levied without the consent of Lords and Commons ; [which may justly be regarded as the commencement of the present system of taxation, the latter be ginning from this time to regulate the supplies.] The same monarch ratified the Magna Charta no less than eleven times in the course of his reign ; and henceforward this fundamental law began to be regarded as sacred and unalterable. [Edward I. died on his way to Scotland, whither"], [171, "SECT. 24. 153 MODERN HISTORY. he was proceeding to prosecute afresh his dis puted claims on that high-spirited nation, A. D. 1307-] 2. Edward II. was in character the very op posite of his father, weak, indolent, and capri cious, but of humane and benevolent affections. He disgusted his nobles by his attachment to mean and undeserving favourites, whom he raised to the highest dignities of the state, and ho noured with his exclusive confidence. [The modern system of administration, by responsible agents, being unknown at that time throughout the whole of Europe.] Piers Gaveston, a vicious and trifling minion, whom the King ap pointed Regent when on a journey to Paris to marry Isabella, daughter of Philip the Fair, dis gusted the barons to such a pitch, that they compelled the King to delegate all the authority of government to certain commissioners, and to abandon his favourite to their resentment. He Was doomed to perpetual imprisonment, and, on attempt to escape, was seized and beheaded. 3. Edward, in obedience to his father's will, invaded Scotland with 100,000 men. King Robert Bruce met this immense force with 30,000 at Bannockburn, and defeated them with pro digious slaughter, [June, 25. 1314.] This im-"], [172, "154 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. portant victory secured the independency of Scotland. Edward escaped by sea to his own dominions ; and a new favourite, Spencer, sup plying the place of Gaveston, his undeserved elevation and overbearing character completed the disaffection of the nobles to their sovereign. The Queen, a vicious adulteress, joined the malcontents, and, passing over to France, ob tained from her brother Charles IV. an army to invade England, and dethrone her husband. Her enterprise was successful. Spencer and his father were betrayed into the hands of their ene mies, and perished on a scaffold. The King was taken prisoner, tried by parliament, and solemnly deposed ; and, being confined to prison, was soon aster put to death with unexampled circum stances of cruelty, 1327. 4. Edward III., crowned at fourteen years of age, could not submit to the regency of a mother stained with the foulest of crimes. His father's death was revenged by the perpetual imprison ment of Isabella, and the public execution of her paramour Mortimer. Bent on the conquest of Scotland, Edward marched to the north with a prodigious army, vanquished the Scots in the battle of Hallidounhill, and placed Edward Baliol, his vassal and tributary, on the throne,"], [173, "SECT. 24. MODERN HISTORY. 155 But the kingdom was as repugnant as ever to the rule of England, and a favourable oppor tunity was taken for the renewal of hostilities, on the departure of Edward for a foreign enter prise, which gave full scope to his ambition. 5. On the death of Charles IV. without male issue, the crown of France was claimed by Edward III. of England, in right of his mother, the sister of Charles, while, in the mean time, the throne was occupied by the male heir, Philip of Valois [on the ground of the pretended Salic law, which not only Charles himself had once disputed out of jealousy of his brother Philip, but even Charles of Valois ; the father of the reigning Prince, overlooking the chance it held out of the elevation of his own descendants.] Edward fitted out an immense armament by sea and land ; and, obtaining a signal victory over the French fleet, landed on the coast of Nor mandy, and, with his son, the Black Prince, ran a career of the most glorious exploits. Philip, with 100,000 men, met the English with 30,000, and was entirely defeated in the field of Cressy, August 26th, 1348. Here the English are said for the first time to have used artillery in battle. Fire-arms are thus but a recent invention (1340), and have much contributed to lessen both the"], [174, "156 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. slaughter and the frequency of wars. Mr. Hume observes, that war is now reduced nearly to a matter of calculation. A nation knows its power ; and, when overmatched, either yields to its enemies, or secures itself by alliance. But late events have given some contradiction to these opinions. Calais, taken by the English, re mained in their possession for 210 years. 6. The Scots, in the mean time, invading Eng land, were defeated in the battle of Durham, by Philippa, the heroic Queen of Edward III., and their sovereign David II. led prisoner to Lon don. A truce concluded between Edward and Philip was dissolved by the death of the latter, and the succession of his son John, who took the field with 60,000 men against the Black Prince, and was defeated by him with a far inferior number in the signal battle of Poictiers, September 19- 1356. John King of France was led in triumph to London, the fellow-prisoner of David, King of Scotland. But England derived from these victories nothing but honour. The French continued the war with great vigour during the captivity of their sovereign, who died in London, 1864 ; and they obtained a peace by the cession to the English of Poictou, St. Onge, Perigord, &c. ; while Edward consented to fe-"], [175, "SECT. 24. 157 MODERN HISTORY. nounce his claim to the crown of France. The death of the Black Prince, 1371, a most heroic and virtuous character, plunged the nation in grief, and broke the spirits of his father, who did not long survive him. [Charles V. of France availed himself of this untimely loss, and Edward's advanced age, to recover for France almost all that the father and son had wrested from her. His policy, though far from being pure, obtained for this monarch the surname of Wise.] [7- The English constitution may be said to have been considerably advanced during the reign of Edward III., particularly in regard to the three following grand securities. First, the more complete establishment of the illegality of raising money without the consent of the people ; secondly, the necessity of the concurrence of the two houses of parliament in any alteration of the law ; and, thirdly, the right of the Com mons to enquire into public abuses, and to im peach the King's counsellors. The statute of high treason also passed in this reign was a great security both to the government and the people.] 8. Richard II. succeeded his grandfather, 1377, at the age of eleven. Charles VI. soon aster became King of France at the age of"], [176, "158 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. twelve, and both kingdoms suffered from the distractions attending a regal minority. In England the contests for power between the King's uncles, Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, embroiled all public measures ; and the conse quent disorders required a stronger hand to compose them than that of the weak and facile Richard. Taking advantage of the King's ab sence, then engaged in quelling an insurrection in Ireland, Henry of Lancaster, [who had suc ceeded to the title on the death of the King's uncle, being at the time in a state of exile,] rose in open rebellion, and compelled Richard, at his return, to resign the erown. The parliament confirmed his deposition, and he was soon after privately assassinated. Thus began the conten tions between the houses of York and Lancaster. [9. It was during the reign of Richard, that Wickliff, who had some time before set himself to expose and censure the corruptions of the clergy, put out his English Bible ; thereby paving the way for the reformation of religion not only at home but abroad.

STATE OF MANNERS. 1. Henry IV. ascended the throne on the deposition of Richard II., 1399, and had im mediately to combat a rebellion raised by the Earl of Northumberland, for placing Mortimer, [Earl of March,] the heir of the house of York, on the throne. The Scotch and Welsh took part with the rebels, but their united forces were de feated at Shrewsbury, and their leader, young Percy (Hotspur), killed on the field. A second rebellion, headed by the Archbishop of York, was quelled by the capital punishment of its author. [The support of the clergy being a matter of importance to Henry,] the secular arm was rigorously extended against the followers of Wickliff; and this reign saw the first detestable examples of religious persecution. The life of Henry was imbittered by the youthful disorders"], [178, "160 MODERN HISTORY. PART II*. of his son the Prince of Wales, who afterwards nobly redeemed his character. Henry IV. died 1413, at the age of forty-six. 2. Henry V. took advantage of the disorders of France, from the temporary insanity of its sovereign, Charles VI., and the factious struggles for power between the Dukes of Burgundy and Orleans, to invade the kingdom with a large army, which a contagious distemper wasted down to a fifth of its numbers ; yet, with this handful of resolute and hardy troops, he defeated the French army of 60,000, under the Constable D' Albert, in the famous battle of Agincourt, in which 10,000 of the enemy were slain, and 14,000 made prisoners, October 24. 1415. Re turning to England to recruit his forces, he landed again with an army of 25,000, and fought his way to Paris. The insane monarch, with his court, fled to Troye ; and Henry pursuing, terminated the war by a treaty with the Queen mother, [who had taken the part of the English monarch against her own son,] and the Duke of Burgundy, by which it was agreed that he should marry Catherine the daughter of Charles VI., and receive the kingdom of France as her dowry, which, till the death of her father, he should govern as regent."], [179, "SECT. 25. 161 MODERN HISTORY. 3. Mean time the return os Henry to England gave the Dauphin hopes of the recovery of his kingdom. He was victorious in an engagement with the English under the Duke of Clarence : but his success was of no longer duration than the absence of the English sovereign, who was himself hastening to the period of his triumphs. Seized with a mortal distemper, Henry died in the 34th year of his age, 1422, one of the most heroic princes that ever swayed the sceptre of England. His brother, the Duke of Bedford, was declared Regent of France, and [on the death of Charles VI., who survived Henry V. but a few months,] Henry VI., an infant nine months old, was proclaimed King at Paris and at London, 1422. 4, Charles VII. recovered France by slow degrees ; [being, however, from a natural in dolence of character, and love of pleasure, a spectator rather than an actor in the restoration of his country.] With the aid of a young female enthusiast, the Maid of Orleans, whom the credulity of the age supposed to be inspired by Heaven, [and who having declared that she would procure her sovereign to be crowned at Rheims, fulfilled her promise,] he gained several important advantages over the English, which vol. n. m"], [180, "162 PART II.

The government of the English was universally detested : it was a struggle of many years ; but at length, in 1450, they were deprived of all they had ever possessed in France, except Calais and Guignes. Charles, when he had restored his kingdom to peace, governed it with admirable wisdom and moderation. [He is said to have starved himself to death under an ap prehension of poison, 1461, his last days being much embittered by the unnatural conduct of his son, afterwards Lewis XL] 5. The state of England and of France, the two most polished kingdoms in Europe, furnishes a good criterion of the condition of society in those ages of which we have been treating. Even in the large cities the houses were roofed with thatch, and had no chimnies. Glass win- dows were extremely rare, and the floors were covered with straw. In England wine was sold only in the shops of the apothecaries, [as a cordial.] Paper made from linen rags was first manufactured in the beginning of the fifteenth century ; and the use of linen for shirts was at that time a very rare piece of luxury. Yet it"], [181, "SECT. 25. 163 MODERN HISTORY. appears, that even before that age the progress of luxury had excited a serious alarm ; for the parliament under Edward HI. found it neces sary to prohibit the use of gold and silver in apparel to all who had not a hundred pounds a-year ; and Charles VI. of France ordained, that none should presume to entertain with more than two dishes and a mess of soup. [6. It was in the reign of this king that card playing appears to have come into vogue in France ; for that cards were known and partially introduced much earlier than this, can scarcely be denied. It has been conjectured that they might have been derived through the Moors from the East. This was also the period when those extraordinary theatrical exhibitions, the Mysteries, or Miracle Plays, as they were called, prevailed, in which the most sacred subjects were profaned, even in the churches, by repre sentations and mummeries, the most absurd and disgusting; but which are supposed, nevertheless, to have been invented by the priests, that they might keep in their own hands the amusement and occupation of minds incapacitated for any more rational or refined recreations.] 7.

MODERN HISTORY. in great bands, who laid waste entire villages ; and some of the household-officers of Henry III. excused themselves for robbing on the highway, because the King allowed them no wages. In 1303, the abbot and monks of Westminster were indicted for robbing the King's exchequer, but acquitted. The admirable laws of Edward I., which acquired him the title of the English Justinian, give strong testimony of the miserable policy and barbarism of the preceding times. XXVI. DECLINE AND FALL OF THE GREEK EMPIRE. 1. In the fourteenth century the Turks were proceeding by degrees to encroach on the frontiers of the Greek empire. The Sultan Ottoman had fixed the seat of his government at Byrsa in Bithynia, and his son Orcan ex tended his sovereignty to the Propontis, and obtained in marriage the daughter of the Em peror John Cantacuzenos. About the middle of the century, the Turks, [encouraged by dis sensions in the Grecian court,] crossed over into Europe, and took Adrianople. The Em-"], [183, "SECT. 26. 165 MODERN HISTORY. peror John Pal\u00e6ologus, after meanly soliciting aid from the Pope, concluded a humiliating treaty with Sultan Amurat, [the successor of Orcan,] and [having put out the eyes of his eldest son,] gave his second as a hostage to serve in the Turkish army. 2. Bajazet, the [son and] successor of Amu rat, compelled the Emperor to destroy his fort of Galata, and to admit a Turkish judge into the city. He prepared now to besiege Constan tinople in form, when he was forced to change his purpose, and defend himself against the victorious Tamerlane. 3. Timur-bek or Tamerlane, a prince of the Usbek Tartars, and descended from Gen giskan, after the conquest of Persia, and a great part of India and Syria, was invited by the Asiatic princes, enemies of Bajazet, to protect them against the Ottoman power, which threat ened to overwhelm them. Tamerlane, flattered by this request, imperiously summoned the Turk to renounce his conquests ; a message answered with a proud defiance. The armies met near Angoria (Ancyra), in Phrygia, and Bajazet was totally defeated and made prisoner by Tamerlane, 1402. The conqueror made Sa marcand the capital of his empire, and there m 3"], [184, "166 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. received the homage of all the princes of the East, [from Manuel the Greek Emperor, and from Henry III. of Castile, who sent embas sadors to him.] Illiterate himself, he was so licitous for the cultivation of literature and science in his dominions ; and Samarcand be came for a while the seat of learning, politeness, and the arts, but was destined to relapse, after a short period, into its ancient barbarism. 4. The Turks, after the death of Tamerlane, [in 1406, at a very advanced age,] resumed their purpose of destroying the empire of the East. Amurat II., [grandson of Bajazet,] a prince of a singular character, had, on the faith of a so- lemn treaty with the King of Poland, devoted his days to retirement and study. A violation of the treaty, by an attack from the Poles on his dominions, made him quit his solitude. He engaged and cut to pieces the Polish army, with their perfidious sovereign, and then calmly re- turned to his retreat, till a similar crisis of public expediency once more brought him into active life. He left his dominions to his son Maho- met II., surnamed the Great, who resumed the project for the destruction of Constantinople; but its fall was a second time retarded by the necessity in which the Turks were unexpectedly"], [185, "SECT. 26. 167 MODERN HISTORY. placed, of defending their own dominions against a powerful invader. 5. Scanderberg (John Castriot) Prince of Albania, whose territories had been seized by Amurat II., was educated by the Sultan as his own child, and, when of age, intrusted with the command of an army, which he employed in wresting from Amurat his paternal kingdom, 1443. By great talents and military skill, he maintained his independent sovereignty against the whole force of the Turkish empire. 6. Mahomet II., son of the philosophic Amurat, [whom he succeeded 1451,] a youth of twenty-one years of age, [and rare endow ments, though traduced by monkish writers,] resumed the plan of extinguishing the empire of the Greeks, and making Constantinople the capital of the Ottoman power. Its indolent inhabitants made but a feeble preparation for defence, and the powers of Europe looked on with the most supine indifference. The Turks assailed the city both on the land side and that of the sea ; and, battering down its walls with their cannon, entered sword in hand, and mas sacred all who opposed them. The Emperor Constantine was slain ; the city [after a siege of forty-nine days,] surrendered; and thus was M 4"], [186, "168 MODERN HISTORY. PART \\U finally extinguished the eastern empire of the Romans, A.D. 1453, which, from the building of its capital by Constantine the Great, had subsisted 1123 years. The Imperial edifices were preserved from destruction, the churches converted into mosques; but the exercise of their religion was allowed to all the Christians. From that time the Greek Christians have regu larly chosen their own patriarch, whom the Sultan instals ; although his authority continues to be disputed by the Latin patriarch, who is chosen by the Pope. Mahomet the Great libe rally patronised the arts and sciences ; and to compensate for the migration of those learned Greeks, who, on the fall of the empire, spread themselves over the countries of Europe, invited both artists and men of letters to his capital from other kingdoms. 7. The taking of Constantinople was followed by the conquest of Greece and Epirus ; and Italy might probably have met with a similar fate, but for the fleet of the Venetians who op posed the arms of Mahomet with considerable success, and even attacked him in Greece ; but the contending powers soon after put an end to hostilities by a treaty. Mahomet the Great died at the age of fifty-one, 1481, [leaving his"], [187, "SECT. 27. 169 MODERN HISTORY. newly acquired empire to the sway of his son Bajazet II., a mild and comparatively pacific prince, but who yet began that contest with the sovereign of Egypt, which in the reign of Selim his successor terminated in the subjugation of that country, 1517.] XXVII. GOVERNMENT AND POLICY OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE. 1. The government of Turkey is an absolute monarchy, the whole legislative and executive authority of the state centering in the Sultan, whose power is subject to no constitutional con trol. It is, however, limited in some degree by religious opinion ; the precepts of the Koran inculcating certain duties on the Sovereign, which it would be held an impiety to transgress. It is yet more strongly limited by the fear of dethronement and assassination. Under these restraints, the prince can never venture on an extreme abuse of power. 2. The spirit of the people is fitted for a subjection bordering on slavery. Concubinage"], [188, "170 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. being agreeable to the law of Mahomet, the Grand Seignior, the viziers, are born of female slaves ; and there is scarce a subject of the empire of ingenuous blood by both parents. It is a fundamental maxim of the Turkish policy, that all the officers of state should be such as the Sultan can entirely command, and at any time destroy, without danger to himself 3. The Grand Vizier is usually intrusted with the whole functions of government, and of course subjected to the sole responsibility for all public measures. Subordinate to him are six viziers of the bench, who are his council and assessors in cases of law, of which he is supreme judge. The power of the Grand Vizier is ab solute over all the subjects of the empire ; but he cannot put to death a Beglerbeg or a Bashaw without the Imperial signature ; nor punish a Janizary, unless through the medium of his military commander. The Beglerbegs are the governors of several provinces, the Bashaws of a single province. All dignities in the Turkish empire are personal, and dependant on the Sovereign's pleasure. 4. The revenues of the Grand Seignior arise from taxes and customs laid on the subject, annual tributes paid by the Tartars, stated gifts t"], [189, "SECT. 28. MODERN HISTORY. 171 from the governors of the provinces, and, above all, the confiscations of estates, from the Viziers and Bashaws downwards, to the lowest subjects of the empire. The certain and fixed revenues of the Sovereign are small in comparison to those which are arbitrary ; and his absolute power en ables him to execute great projects at a small expense. XXVIII. FRANCE AND ITALY IN THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY. 1. There was scarcely any vestige now re maining in France of the ancient feudal govern ment. The only subsisting fiefs were Burgundy and Brittany. Charles the Bold, Duke of Bur gundy, [whose dominions, acquired by marriage or purchase, extended from the frontiers of Pro vence to the German ocean, and who expected the kingly title to be conferred on him, with the consent of the Emperor,] sought to increase his territories by the conquest of Switzerland and Lorraine, but was defeated by the Swiss, and killed in battle; and as he left no son,"], [190, "172 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. Lewis XI. of France took possession of Bur gundy as a male fief, 1447. The Duke's daughter married Maximilian, son of the Emperor Fre deric III., who, by this marriage, acquired the sovereignty of the Netherlands. 2. The acquisition of Burgundy, and of Pro vence, which was bequeathed to France by the Count de la Marche, increased very greatly the power of the crown ; [which was still farther in creased shortly after by the acquisition of Brit tany.] Lewis XL, an odious compound of vice, cruelty, and superstition, and a tyrant to his people, was yet the author of many wise and ex cellent regulations of public policy. The bar barity of the public executions in his reign is be yond all belief ; yet the wisdom of his laws, the encouragement he gave to commerce, the re straints he imposed on the oppressions of the nobility, and the attention he bestowed in re gulating the courts of justice, must ever be men tioned to his honour. 3. The Count de la Marche, besides the be quest of Provence to Lewis XL, left him his empty title of Sovereign of the Two Sicilies. Lewis was satisfied with the substantial gift ; but his son Charles VIII. was dazzled with the shadow. In the beginning of his reign he pro-"], [191, "SECT. 28. 173 MODERN HISTORY. jected the conquest of Naples, and embarked in the enterprise with the most improvident pre cipitancy. 4. The dismembered state of Italy was fa vourable to his views. The Popedom, during the transference of its seat to Avignon, had lost many of its territories. Mantua, Modena, and Ferrara, had their independent sovereigns. Piedmont belonged to the Duke of Savoy ; Ge noa and Milan to the family of Sfbrza. Florence, under the Medici, had attained to a very high pitch of splendour. [This remarkable family had in the interval of time between the years 1421 and 1492] employed, [through three successive generations,] a vast fortune acquired by com merce in the improvement of their country, in acts of public munificence, and in the cultivation of the sciences and elegant arts. [Giovanni, Cosmo, and Lorenzo, had in particular so ingra- tiated themselves with the people as to obtain, with ease,] the chief authority in their native state ; [and it must be acknowledged that, under their rule and government, Florence and its de pendencies prospered beyond every thing before known, terminating in nothing less than the improvement of the whole of western Europe, not only by what has been reasonably denomi-"], [192, "174 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. nated the restoration of learning, but by that attention to the security of the several states of Europe, from any preponderating or overwhelm- ing force, as tended to keep in view a balance of power, through the appointment of accredited ministers, reciprocally, amongst all the states of Europe, to take account, and give timely in- formation, of any movements at all tending to disturb the general tranquillity.] Peter de Me- dici, the great grandson [of Cosmo, and son of Lorenzo, who died 1492,] ruled in Florence at the period of the expedition of Charles VIII. into Italy. 5. The Papacy was enjoyed at this time by Alexander VI., a monster of wickedness. The Pope and the Duke of Milan, who had invited Charles to this enterprise, immediately betrayed him, and joined the interest of the King of Na ples. Charles, after besieging the Pope in Rome, and forcing him to submission, devoutly kissed his feet. He now marched against Naples, while its timid Prince, Alphonso, fled to Sicily, and his son Ferdinand to the Isle of Ischia, after absolving his subjects from their allegiance. Charles entered Naples in triumph, and was hailed Emperor and Augustus : but he lost his new kingdom in almost as short a time as he had"], [193, "SECT. 28. 175 MODERN HISTORY. gained it. A league was formed against France between the Pope, the Emperor Maximilian, Ferdinand of Arragon, Isabella of Castile, and the Venetians ; and on the return of Charles to France, the troops he had lest to guard his con quest were entirely driven out of Italy, [he him self indeed accomplishing his retreat with no small danger.] 6. It has been remarked, that from the decisive effect of this confederacy against Charles VIII. the sovereigns of Europe derived an useful lesson of policy, and first adopted the idea of preserving a balance of power, by that tacit league which is understood to be always sub sisting, for the prevention of the inordinate ag grandisement of any particular state. [A lesson they had derived from Lorenzo de Medici, as has been before shown.] 7. Charles VIII. died at the age of twenty eight, 1498 ; and, leaving no children, the Duke of Orleans succeeded to the throne of France, by the title of Lewis XII."], [194, "176 MODERN HISTORY. PART II XXIX. HISTORY OF SPAIN IN THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES. 1. We go back a little to the middle of the fourteenth century, to trace the history of Spain. Peter of Castile, surnamed the Cruel, (for no other reason than that he employed severe means to support his just rights,) had to contend against a bastard brother, Henry of Transtamarre, who, with the aid of a French banditti, called Malan- drins, led by Bertrand du Guesclin, [one of the most extraordinary characters of the age,] strove to dispossess him of his kingdom. Peter was aided by Edward the Black Prince, then So vereign of Guienne, who defeated Transtamarre, and took Bertrand prisoner ; but, on the return of the Prince to England, [Bertrand du Guesclin having obtained his liberty by ransom,] Peter was attacked by his former enemies, and [in the neighbourhood of Toledo] entirely defeated. Unable to restrain his rage in the first interview with Transtamarre, the latter put him to death"], [195, "SECT. 29. 177 MODERN HISTORY. with his own hand, 1368 ; and thus this usurper secured for himself and his posterity the throne of Castile. 2. The weakness and debauchery of one of his descendants, Henry IV. of Castile, [who be gan his reign in 1454,] occasioned a revolution in the kingdom. The majority of the nation rose in rebellion ; the assembly of the nobles solemnly deposed their King, and, on the al leged ground of his daughter Johanna being a bastard, compelled him to settle the crown on his sister Isabella. [In vain did the unhappy King assert the legitimacy of his daughter, by a solemn oath on his death-bed : the opposite party prevailed ; and the unfortunate Princess, whom the King of Portugal sought in marriage, was obliged to spend the remainder of her days in a monastery.] They next brought about a marriage between Isabella and Ferdinand of Ar ragon, which united the monarchies of Arragon and Castile. After a ruinous civil war, the re volution was finally completed by the death of the deposed sovereign, 1474, and the retirement of his daughter, [as has been before shown,] 1479. 3. At the accession of Ferdinand and Isabella to the thrones of Arragon and Castile, Spain was VOL. II. N-"], [196, "178 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. in a state of great disorder, from the lawless de predations of the nobles and their vassals. It was the first object of the new sovereigns to re press these enormities, by subjecting the of fenders to the utmost rigour of the law, enforced by the sword. The Holy Brotherhood was in stituted for the discovery and punishment of crimes ; and the Inquisition, (see supra, Sect. XIX. \u00a7 3.) under the pretext of extirpating heresy and impiety, afforded the most detestable examples of sanguinary persecution. 4. The Moorish kingdom of Granada, a most splendid monarchy, but at that time weakened by faction, and a prey to civil war, offered a tempting object to the ambition of Ferdinand and Isabella. Alboacen was at war with his nephew Aboabdeli, who wanted to dethrone him ; and Ferdinand aided Aboabdeli, in the view of ruining both ; for no sooner was the latter in possession of the crown by the death of Alboacen, than Ferdinand invaded his ally with the whole force of Arragon and Castile. Granada was besieged in 1491 ; and, after a blockade of eight months, surrendered to the victor. Abo abdeli, by a mean capitulation, saved his life, and purchased a retreat for his countrymen to a mountainous part of the kingdom, where they 9*"], [197, "SECT. 29. MODERN HISTORY. 179 were suffered to enjoy unmolested their laws and their religion. Thus ended the dominion of the Moors in Spain, which had subsisted for 800 years. 5. Ferdinand, from that period, took the title of King of Spain. In 1492, he expelled all the Jews from his dominions, on the absurd ground that they kept in their hands the commerce of the kingdom; and Spain thus lost above 150,000 of the most industrious of her inhabitants. The exiles spread themselves over the other king doms of Europe, and were often the victims of a persecution equally inhuman. It would appear that Spain has felt, even to the present times, the effects of this folly, in the slow progress of the arts, and that deplorable inactivity which is the characteristic of her people. Even the dis covery of the New World, which happened at this very period, and which stimulated the spirit of enterprise and industry in all the neighbour ing kingdoms, produced but a feeble impression on that nation, which might in a great degree have monopolised its benefits. Of that great discovery we shall afterwards treat in a separate section. sr 2"], [198, "180 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. XXX. FRANCE, SPAIN, AND ITALY, IN THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH AND BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 1. Lewis XIL, eagerly bent on vindicating his right to Naples, [and anxious to be divorced from his wife, the sister of Charles VIIL, that he might marry his widow, Anne of Brittany,] courted the interest of Pope Alexander VI., who promised his aid, on the condition that his natural son, C\u00e6sar Borgia, should receive from Lewis the duchy of Valentinois, with the King of Navarre's sister in marriage, [though at that time an archbishop.] Lewis crossed the Alps ; and, in the space of a few days, was master of Milan and Genoa. Sfbrza Duke of Milan became his prisoner for life. Afraid of the power of Ferdinand of Spain, Lewis joined with him in the conquest of Naples, and agreed to divide with him the conquered dominions, the Pope making no scruple to sanction the parti tion. But the compromise was of no duration ;"], [199, "SECT. 30. 181 MODERN HISTORY. for Alexander VI. and Ferdinand judging it a better policy to share Italy between themselves, united their interest to strip Lewis of his new territories. The Spaniards, under Gonsalvo de Cordova, [the Great Captain, as he was called,] defeated the French under the Duke de Nemours, [a descendant of Clovis,] and the Chevalier Bayard ; and Lewis irrecoverably lost his share of the kingdom of Naples ; [Frederic of Arragon, the deposed King, becoming his pensioner, by taking refuge in France, rather than trust him self in the hands of his relation, the treacherous Ferdinand.] 2. History relates with horror the crimes of Pope Alexander VI. and his son C\u00e6sar Borgia ; their murders, robberies, profanations, incests. They compassed their ends in attaining every object of their ambition, but with the universal abhorrence of mankind, and finally met with an ample retribution for their crimes. The Pope died by poison, prepared, as was alleged, by himself for an enemy ; and Borgia, stripped of all his possessions by Pope Julius II., and sent prisoner to Spain by Gonsalvo de Cordova, perished in miserable obscurity. 3.

They accomplished in part their design ; and Venice was on the verge of annihilation, when the Pope changed his politics; and having made the French subservient to his views of plunder ing the Venetians, now formed a new league with them, and the Germans and Spaniards, to expel the French from Italy, and appropriate all their conquests. The Swiss and the English co-operated in this design. The French made a brave resistance under their celebrated Generals Bayard and Gaston de Foix, but were finally overpowered. Lewis was compelled to evacuate Italy : Ferdinand, with the aid of Henry VIIL of England, stripped him of Navarre, and forced him to purchase a peace. He died in 1515 ; and, though unfortunate in his military enter prises, from the superior abilities of his rivals, Pope Julius and Ferdinand, was justly esteemed by his subjects for the wisdom and equity of his government. [4. The character of Pope Julius was very remarkable, not only as a politician, but as a soldier. In his last contests with the French"], [201, "SECT. 31. 183 MODERN HISTORY. he headed his troops, at the advanced age of seventy, was seen, at the siege of Mirandola, to mount the trenches with his helmet on, to visit the works, to press the engineers, and at length victoriously to enter the breach.] XXXI. HISTORY OF ENGLAND FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE FIFTEENTH TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. CIVIL WARS OF YORK AND LANCASTER. 1. We have seen France recovered from the English in the earlypart of the reign of Henry VI. by the talents and prowess of Charles VII. [and his Generals.] During the minority of Henry, who was a prince of no capacity, England was embroiled by the factious contention for power between his uncles, the Duke of Gloucester and the Cardinal of Winchester. The latter, to promote his own views of ambition, married Henry to Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Regnier the titular King of Naples, a woman of great mental endowments and singular heroism of cha racter, but whose severity in the persecution of n 4"], [202, "184 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. herenemies, [particularly the Duke of Gloucester, the King's uncle, whose untimely death was openly imputed to her,] alienated a great part of the nobles from their ellegiance, and in creased the partisans of a rival claimant of the crown. 2. This was Richard Duke of York, descended by his mother from Lionel second son of Ed ward III., and elder brother to John of Gaunt, the progenitor of Henry VI. The White Rose distinguished the faction of York, as the Red that of Lancaster. The party of York gained much strength from the incapacity of Henry, who was subject to fits of lunacy ; [and from the removal of Suffolk, the prime minister and favourite of the Queen, who being impeached in parliament, was banished to France.] Richard was appointed Lieutenant and Protector of the kingdom. The authority of Henry was now annihilated ; but Margaret roused her husband, in an interval of sanity, to assert his right ; and the nation was divided in arms between the rival parties. In the battle of St. Alban's 5000 of the Lancastrians were slain, and the King, [being wounded in the neck with an arrow,] was taken prisoner by the Duke of York, 22d May, 1 454. Yet the Parliament, while it"], [203, "SECT. 31. MODERN HISTORY. 185 confirmed the authority of the Protector, main tained its allegiance to the King. 3. The spirit of the Queen re-animated the royal party : -[she not only raised an army, but in the absence of the King headed it herself;] and the Lancastrians gained such advantage, that the Duke of York fled to Ireland, while his cause was secretly maintained in England by Guy Earl of Warwick. In the battle of Nor thampton the party of York again prevailed, and Henry once more was brought prisoner to London, while his dauntless Queen, [who had fought by his side during the heat of the en gagement,] still nobly exerted herself to retrieve his fortunes. York now claimed the crown in open parliament, but prevailed only to have his right of succession ascertained on Henry's death, to the exclusion of the royal issue. 4. In the next battle the Duke of York [and his second son, the Earl of Rutland,] were slain, and their party defeated; but his successor Edward, supported by Warwick, avenged this disaster by a signal victory near Touton, in Yorkshire, 1461, in which 40,000 of the Lan castrians were slain. York was proclaimed King by the title of Edward IV., while Mar-"], [204, "186 MODERN HISTORY. PART II* garet, with her dethroned husband and infant son, fled to Flanders. 5. Edward, who owed his crown to Warwick, was ungrateful to his benefactor ; and the im prudence and injustice of his conduct forced that nobleman at length to take part with the faction of Lancaster. The consequence was, that, after some struggles, Edward was deposed, and Henry VI. once more restored to the throne by the hands of Warwick, now known by the epithet of The King-maker. But this change was of no duration ; the party of York ulti mately prevailed ; the Lancastrians were de feated in the battle of Barnet, and the brave Warwick slain in the engagement, 1472. 6. The intrepid Margaret, whose spirit was superior to every change of fortune, prepared to strike a last blow for the crown of England in the battle of Tewkesbury. The event was fatal to her hopes : victory declared for Edward. Margaret was sent prisoner to the Tower of London ; and the Prince her son, a youth of high spirit, when brought into the presence of his conqueror, having nobly dared to justify his enterprise to the face of his rival, was barbar ously murdered by the Dukes of Gloucester and Clarence. Llenry VI. was soon after privately"], [205, "SECT. 31. 187 MODERN HISTORY. put to death in the Tower. The heroic Mar garet, ransomed by Lewis XL, died in France, 1482, [having undoubtedly done as much as she could do as a Queen, a wife, and a mother, to dispel the odium incurred at the commence ment of her reign, by the vindictive proceedings against her enemies, which we had occasion to notice.] 7- Edward IV., thus secured on the throne by the death of all his competitors, abandoned himself without reserve to the indulgence of a vicious and tyrannical nature. He put to death, on the most frivolous pretence, his brother Clarence ; and, preparing to gratify his subjects by a war with France, he died suddenly, in the forty-second year of his age, poisoned, as was suspected, by his brother, Richard Duke of Gloucester, 1483. 8. Edward left two sons, the elder, Ed ward V., a boy of thirteen years of age. Richard Duke of Gloucester, named Protector in the minority of his nephew, hired, by means of Buckingham, a mob of the dregs of the popu lace to declare their wish for his assumption of the crown. He yielded, with affected reluct ance, to this voice of the nation, and was pro claimed King by the title of Richard III., 1483."], [206, "188 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. [He had indeed taken steps to assert his un doubted right' to the crown conferred on him, by procuring a Bill to be passed by the Parlia ment, bastardising the issue of his brother, and thereby rendering the people the more indif ferent about their fate.] Edward V., (after a reign of two months,) together with his brother the Duke of York, were, by command of the usurper, smothered while asleep, and privately buried in the Tower. 9. These atrocious crimes found an avenger in Henry Earl of Richmond, the surviving heir of the house of Lancaster, who, aided by Charles VIIL of France, landed in England, and revived the spirits of a party almost extin guished in the kingdom. He gave battle to Richard in the field of Bosworth, and entirely defeated the army of the usurper, who wag slain while fighting with the most desperate courage, August 22. 1485. The crown he wore in the engagement, [artfully insinuating thereby that he was contending against a rebel,] was im mediately placed on the head of the conqueror. This auspicious day put an end to the civil wars of York and Lancaster. Henry VII. united the rights of both families by his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV. i7"], [207, "SECT. 31. MODERN HISTORY. 189 10. The reign of Henry VII. was of twenty four years' duration; and, under his wise and politic government, the kingdom recovered all the wounds it had sustained in those unhappy contests. Industry, good order, and perfect subordination, were the fruit of the excellent laws passed in this reign ; though the temper of the Sovereign was despotic, and his avarice in the latter part of his reign prompted to the most oppressive exactions. 11. The government of Henry was disturbed by two very singular enterprises ; the attempt of Lambert Simnel, the son: of a -baker,* to counter feit the person of the Earl of Warwick, son -of the Duke of Clarence ; and the similar attempt of Perkin Warbeck, son of a Flemish Jew, to counterfeit the Duke.of York, who had been smothered in. the tower by Richard III. Both impostors found considerable support, but were finally, defeated. Simnel, after being crowned at Dublin King of England and Ireland, ended his days in a menial office of Henry's household. Perkin, for five years, supported his cause by force of arms, [countenanced by the King of France,] and aided by a great proportion of the English nobility; [acknowledged even by the Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward IV., as"], [208, "190 MODERN HISTORY. PART II*. her nephew, and married to a Princess of the house of York.] Overpowered at length, he surrendered to Henry, who condemned him to perpetual imprisonment ; but his ambitious spirit meditating a new insurrection, he was put to death as a traitor. Henry VII. died 1509, in the fifty-third year of his age, and twenty-fourth of his reign. XXXII. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY TO THE END OF THE REIGN OF JAMES V. 1. In no country of Europe had the feudal aristocracy attained to a greater height than in Scotland. The power of the greater barons, while it rendered them independent, and often the rivals of their sovereign, was a perpetual source of turbulence and disorder in the king dom. It was therefore a constant policy of the. Scottish kings to humble the nobles, and break their factious combinations. Robert I. attempted to retrench the vast territorial possessions of his barons, by requiring every landholder to pro-"], [209, "SECT. 32. 191 MODERN HISTORY. duce the titles of his estate ; but was resolutely answered, that the sword was their charter of possession. 2. On the death of Robert, in 1329, and during the minority of his son David, Edward Baliol, the son of John formerly King of Scot land, with the aid of Edward III. of England, and supported by many of the factious barons, invaded the kingdom, and was crowned at Scone, while the young David was conveyed for secu rity to France. The mean dependence of Ba liol on the English monarch deprived him of the affections of the people. Robert the Steward of Scotland, Randolph and Douglas, supported the Brucian interest, and, assisted by the French, restored David to his throne ; a Prince destined to sustain many reverses of fortune ; for, in a subsequent invasion of the English territory by the Scots, David was taken prisoner in the battle of Durham, and conveyed to London. He re mained for eleven years in captivity, and wit nessed the similar fate of a brother-monarch, John King of France, taken prisoner by the Black Prince in the battle of Poictiers. David was ransomed by his subjects, and restored to his kingdom in 1357 ; and he ended a turbulent reign in 1370-1. The crown passed at his de-"], [210, "192 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. mise to his nephew Robert, the High Steward of Scotland, in virtue of a destination made by Robert I. with consent of the states. 3. The reign of Robert II., which was of twenty years' duration, was spent in a series of hostilities between the Scots and English, .pro- ductive of no material consequence to either kingdom ; and the weak and indolent disposition of his successor*; Robert III., who found himself unequal to the contest with his factious nobles, prompted him to resign the government to his brother the Duke of Albany. This ambitious man formed the design of usurping the throne by the murder of his nephews, the sons of Ro- bert. The elder, Rothsay, a Prince of high .spirit, was imprisoned, on pretence of treasonable de- signs, and starved to death. The younger, James, escaped a similar fate which was intended for him ; but, on his passage to France, whither he was sent for safety by his father, he was taken by an English ship of war and brought prisoner to London. The weak Robert sunk under these misfortunes, and died, 1405, after a reign of fif teen years. 4. James L, a Prince of great natural endow ments, profited by a captivity of eighteen years at the court of England, in adorning his mind"], [211, "SECT. 32. 193 MODERN HISTORY. with every valuable accomplishment; [as well as in carefully marking and observing those dif ferences in the governments, laws, and customs of the two countries, which might enable him to introduce and promote such changes on his return to Scotland, as should decidedly ame liorate the condition of his native kingdom.] At his return, [therefore, in 1423,] to his king dom, which in his absence had been weakly governed by the Regent Albany, and suffered under all the disorders of anarchy, he bent his whole attention to the improvement and civilisation of his people, by the enactment of many excellent laws, enforced with a resolute authority. The factions of the nobles, their dangerous combinations, and their domineering tyranny over their dependents, the great sources of the people's miseries, were firmly restrained, and most severely punished. But these whole some innovations, while they procured to James the affections of the nation at large, excited the odium of the nobility, and gave birth to a con spiracy, headed by the Earl of Athole, the King's uncle, which terminated in the murder of this excellent Prince, in the 44th year of his age, A.

His son, James II., inherited a consider able portion of the talents of his father ; and, in the like purpose of restraining the inordinate power of his nobles, pursued the' same maxims of government, which an impetuous temper prompt ed him, in some instances, to carry to the most blamable excess ; [having an example set him by Crichton, the minister of his father.] The Earl of Douglas, trusting to a powerful vassalage, had assumed an authority above the laws, and a state and splendour rival to those of his sovereign. He was seized, and, without accusation or trial, beheaded. His successor imprudently running the same career, and boldly justifying, in a con ference, his rebellious practices, was put to death by the King's own hand. Thus were the fac tions of the nobles quelled by a barbarous rigour of authority. To his people James was bene ficent and humane, and his laws contributed ma terially to their civilisation and prosperity, [as well as to the advancement of the kingly au thority.] He was killed in the 30th year of his age, by the bursting of a cannon, in besieging the castle of'Roxburgh, A. D. 1460. 6. His son, James III., without the talents of his predecessors, affected to tread in the same steps. To humble his nobles, he bestowed his"], [213, "SECT. 32. MODERN HISTORY. 195 confidence on mean favourites ; an insult which the former avenged by rebellion. His brothers Albany and Mar, aided by Edward IV. of Eng land, [to whom the former is recorded to have bound himself in promises and engagements derogatory to his honour, as well as to the inde pendence of his country,] attempted a revolu tion in the kingdom, which was frustrated only by the death of Edward. In a second rebellion, the confederate nobles forced the Prince of Roth say, eldest son of James, [then only fifteen years of age,] to appear in arms against his father. In an engagement near Bannockburn the rebels were successful, and the King was slain, in the 35th year of his age, 1488. 7. James IV., a great and most accomplished Prince, whose talents were equalled by his vir tues, while his measures of government were dic tated by a true spirit of patriotism, won by a well-placed confidence the affections of his no bility. In his marriage with Margaret, the daughter of Henry VII. of England, both so vereigns wisely sought a bond of amity between the kingdoms ; but this purpose was frustrated in the succeeding reign of Henry VIIL The high spirit of the rival monarchs was easily in flamed by trifling causes of offence; and France, o 2"], [214, "196 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. then at war with England, courted the aid of her ancient ally. James invaded England with a pow erful army, which he wished to lead to imme diate action ; but the prudent delays of Surrey, the English General, wasted and weakened his force ; and in the fatal battle of Flodden the Scots were defeated with prodigious slaughter. The gallant James perished in the fight, and with him almost the whole of the Scottish nobles, A.D. 1513. 8. Under the long minority of his son James V., an infant at the time of his father's death, the kingdom was feebly ruled by his uncle Albany. The aristocracy began to resume its ancient spirit of independence, which was ill brooked by a Prince of a proud and uncontrollable mind, who felt the keenest jealousy of a high prero gative. With a systematic policy, he employed the church to abase the nobility, [possessing, as he did, the sole right of nomination to vacant bishoprics and abbeys, which alone gave him great power with the clergy, he was careful to] confer all the principal offices of state on able ecclesiastics. The Cardinal Beaton, [a man of superior talents,] co-operated with great zeal in the designs of his master, and under him ruled the kingdom."], [215, "SECT. 32. MODERN HISTORY. 197 9- Henry VIIL, embroiled with the Papacy, sought an alliance with the King of Scots ; but [though Henry had come as far as York, to hold an interview with his nephew, by appoint ment,] the ecclesiastical counsellors of the latter, [for obvious reasons,] defeated this beneficial purpose. A war was thus provoked, and James was reluctantly compelled to court those nobles whom it had been hitherto his darling object to humiliate. They now determined on a dis graceful revenge. In an attack on the Scottish border the English were repelled, and an oppor tunity offered to the Scots of cutting off their retreat. The King gave his orders to that end, but his barons obstinately refused to advance beyond the frontier. One measure more was wanting to drive their Sovereign to despair. In a subsequent engagement with the English, 10,000 of the Scots deliberately surrendered themselves prisoners to 500 of the enemy. The high spirit of James sunk under his contending passions ; and he died of a broken heart, in the 33d year of his age, a few days after the birth of a daughter, [by his queen, Mary of Guise, of the house of Lorraine in France,] yet more unfortunate than her father, Mary Queen of Scots, A. D. 1542. o 3"], [216, "198 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. XXXIII. ON THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION OF THE SCOT- TISH GOVERNMENT. 1. We have seen it a constant policy with the Scottish kings to abase the power of their nobles, and this struggle we have observed to have been the source of much misery and bloodshed ; but the policy was necessary, from the dangerous ambition and lawless tyranny of those nobles, who frequently aimed at overturning the throne, and exercised the severest oppression on all their dependents. The interests, therefore, of the people, no less than the security of the prince, demanded the repression of this over bearing and destructive power. The aristocracy was, however, preserved, no less by its own strength than by the concurrence of circum stances, and chiefly by the violent and unhappy fate of the sovereigns. Mean time, although the measures they pursued were not successful, their consequences were beneficial. They restrained, if they did not destroy, the spirit of feudal op-"], [217, "SECT. 33. 199 MODERN HISTORY. pression, and gave birth to order, wise laws, and a more tranquil administration of government. 2. The legislative power, though nominally resident in the Parliament, was virtually in the King, who, by [an extraordinary] influence, [considering the circumstances in which he stood with the aristocracy,] entirely controlled its pro ceedings. The Parliament consisted of three estates, the nobles, the dignified clergy, and the lesser barons, the representatives of the towns and shires [first admitted as such by Robert Bruce, 1326.] The disposal of benefices gave the crown the entire command of the church men, who equalled the nobles in number ; and at least a majority of the commons were the dependents of the Sovereign. [None of these, indeed, attended so much on the ground of privilege as service. They were as vassals at the court of a superior, attending more for form's sake than as a regular legislative or deliberative body; and, therefore, paying little regard to their own importance, or giving themselves the trouble of questioning too closely the motives or the merits of the measures, laws, or regulations sub mitted to them ; for if they disliked them, they looked to other means of eluding or resisting them, and asserting their independence. The o 4"], [218, "200 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. chief business was done by] a committee, termed the Lords of the Articles, who prepared every measure that was to come before the Parliament, and these, by the mode of their election, were in effect nominated by the King. It is to the credit of the Scottish princes, that there are few instances of their abusing an authority so ex- tensive as that which they constitutionally en joyed. 3. The King had anciently the supreme juris diction in all causes, civil and criminal, which he generally exercised through the medium of his privy council; but in 1425 James I. insti tuted the Court of Session, consisting of the Chancellor and certain judges chosen from the three estates. This Court was new modelled by James V., and its jurisdiction limited to civil causes, the cognisance of crimes being com mitted to the Justiciary. The Chancellor was the highest officer of the crown, and president of the Parliament. To the Chamberlain be longed the care of the finances and the public police ; to the High Steward the charge of the King's household : the Constable regulated all matters of military arrangement ; and the Marshal was the King's lieutenant, and master of the horse."], [219, "SECT. 33. MODERN HISTORY. 201 4. The revenue of the Sovereign consisted of his domain, which was extensive, of the feudal casualties and forfeitures, the profits of the wardships of his vassals, the rents of vacant benefices, the pecuniary fines for offences, and the aids or presents occasionally given by the subject ; a revenue at all times sufficient for the purposes of government, and the support of the dignity of the crown. 5. The political principles which regulated the conduct of the Scots towards other nations were obvious and simple. It had ever been an object of ambition to England to acquire the sovereignty of her sister-kingdom, who was con stantly on her guard against this design of her more potent neighbour. It was the wisest policy for Scotland to attach herself to France, the natural enemy of England; an alliance reci procally courted from similar motives. In those days this attachment was justly esteemed pa triotic ; while the Scots, who were the partisans of England, were with equal justice regarded as traitors to their country. In the period of which we now treat, it was a settled policy of the English sovereigns to have a secret faction in their pay in Scotland, for the purpose of divid ing, and thus enslaving, the nation ; and to this"], [220, "202 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. source all the subsequent disorders of the latter kingdom are to be attributed. XXXIV. A VIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF LITERATURE AND SCIENCE IN EUROPE ; FROM THE REVIVAL OF LETTERS DOWN TO THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY. 1. The first restorers of learning in Europe were the Arabians, who, in the course of their Asiatic conquests, becoming acquainted with some of the ancient Greek authors, discovered and justly appreciated the knowledge and im provement to be derived from them. The caliphs procured from the eastern emperors copies of the ancient manuscripts, and had them care fully translated into Arabic ; esteeming prin cipally, [if not exclusively,] those which treated of mathematics, physics, and metaphysics ; [all the other branches of Grecian literature they seem to have totally neglected ; not even Homer having found an Arabian translator, nor"], [221, "sect. 34. MODERN HISTORY. 203 any Grecian poet, orator, or historian, except Plutarch.] They disseminated their knowledge, [however, such as it was,] in the course of then conquests, and founded schools and colleges in all the countries they subdued. 2. The western kingdoms of Europe became first acquainted with the learning of the ancients through the medium of those Arabian transla tions, [which possibly, after all, were not made from the originals, but from Syriac versions only.] Charlemagne caused Latin translations to be made from the Arabian, [not but that he had a Latin copy of Aristotle's logic made from the original Greek, which appears to have been con sulted by Alcuin and Bede :] he founded, also, after the example of the caliphs, the universi ties of Bononia, Pavia, Osnaburg, and Paris. Alfred, with a similar spirit, and by similar means, introduced a taste for literature in Eng land ; but the subsequent disorders of the kingdom replunged it into barbarism. The Normans, however, brought from the Continent some tincture of ancient learning, which was kept alive in the monasteries, [and which, there is reason to think, had been propagated from Ireland, the original refuge of the learned, during the troubles in Germany ; in these monasteries]"], [222, "204 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. the monks were meritoriously employed in tran scribing a few of the ancient authors, along with the legendary lives of the saints. 3. In this dawn of literature in England ap peared Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, names distinguished in the earliest annals of poetry and romance ; John of Salis bury, a moralist ; William of Mahnesbury, an nalist of the history of England before the reign of Stephen ; Giraldus Cambrensis, known in the fields of history, theology, and poetry ; Joseph of Exeter, author of two Latin epic poems on the Trojan war, and the war of Antioch, or the crusade, which are read with pleasure even in the present day. 4. But this \u00e6ra of a good taste in letters was of short duration. The taste for classical com position and historic information yielded to the barbarous subtleties of scholastic divinity as taught [and practised] by Lombard and Abe lard, [in the twelfth and tliirteenth centuries.] [Two causes may particularly be assigned for this state of things ; first, the necessity men lay under of discussing all philosophical or theo logical questions in the way of public disput ation, before the art of printing had enabled them to communicate their sentiments otherwise;"], [223, "SECT. 34. 205 MODERN HISTORY. and, secondly, the introduction of the Aristote lian philosophy, not by the direct channel of the eastern empire, with the comments and illus trations of those who really understood it, but in the imperfect and often faulty translations of the Arabians. The general attention was also at this time drawn to the rules and doctrines of the Roman civil law, by the lectures of the celebrated Irnerius at Bologna, which as they tended greatly to exalt the imperial and tem poral authority, were quickly followed by the Decretals of Gratian, spoken of in another place; both together forming a complicated system of jurisprudence, which, wherever the two interests came into competition, required the closest ap plication, and no small knowledge of all the arts and expedients of chicanery. In proportion as the study of the law occupied the attention of the northern parts of Italy, the study of medi cine seems to have been cultivated in the south, where the school of Salerno became particularly eminent. The Universities in general followed these changes ; and in addition to the Trivium and Quadrivium, to which they had been pre viously confined, theology, law, and medicine, began to have their several professors, and de grees to be conferred in all these faculties. The"], [224, "206 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. revival of the Roman law, and study of juris prudence, led also to the formation of the French parliaments.] The amusements of the vulgar in those periods were metrical and prose ro mances, unintelligible prophecies, and fables of giants and enchanters. 5. In the middle of the thirteenth century appeared a distinguished genius, Roger Bacon, an English friar, whose comprehensive mind was filled with all the stores of ancient learning; who possessed a discriminating judgment to se parate the precious ore from the dross, and a power of invention fitted to advance in every science which was the object of his study. He saw the insufficiency of the school-philosophy, and first recommended the prosecution of know ledge by experiment and the observation of nature. He made discoveries of importance in astronomy, in optics, in chemistry and medicine, and mechanics. He reformed the kalendar, discovered the construction of telescopic glasses, forgotten after his time, and revived by Galileo, and has left a plain intimation of his knowledge of the composition of gunpowder. Yet this most superior genius believed in the possibility of discovering an elixir for the prolongation of"], [225, "SECT. 34. MODERN HISTORY. 207 life, in the transmutation of metals into gold, and in judicial astrology. 6. A general taste prevailed for poetical com position in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Troubadours of Provence [or Languedoc, for Thoulouse was the principal seat of the provencal muses,] wrote sonnets, madrigals, and satirical ballads, and excelled in extempore dia logues on the subject of love, which they treated in a metaphysical and Platonic strain. [As theirs was the poetry of courts, of polished and artificial society, pastorals seem to have been excluded, or, if in a few instances attempted, to have failed. We stand chiefly indebted to them, perhaps, for the great variety of measures to be found in modern poetry.] They contended for the prize of poetry at solemn meetings, where princes, nobles, and the most illustrious ladies, attended to decide between the rival bards ; and some of those princes, as Richard I. of England, Frederick I. Emperor of Germany, are cele brated themselves as Troubadours of eminence. Many fragments yet remain of their composi tions. [It is usual, indeed, to reckon among them two kings of Arragon, one of Sicily, a Dauphin of Auvergne, and a Prince of Orange, ecclesiastics, monks, libertines, devotees, and"], [226, "208 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. even one inquisitor. The Troubadours dealt in lyric poetry, the Trouveurs, or northern poets, wrote epic] 7. The transference of the Papal seat to Avignon in the fourteenth century familiarised the Italian poets with the songs of the Trouba- dours, and gave a tincture of the Provencal style to their compositions, which is very ob- servable in the poetry of Petrarch and of Dante. [The latter, indeed, did not altogether disdain to write in the Provencal language.] The Divina Comedia of Dante first introduced the machinery of angels and devils in the room of the Pagan mythology, and is a work containing many examples of the terrible sublime. The Sonnets and Canzoni of Petrarch, [who lived almost a century after Dante,] are highly tender and pathetic, though vitiated with a quaintness and conceit, which is a prevalent feature of the Italian poetry. The Decamerone of Boccacio, a work [in prose] of the same age, is a master piece for invention, ingenious narrative, and acquaintance with human nature. These au thors have fixed the standard of the Italian lan guage. [The original unimproved Prove^al style of poetry, as it had little of real genius or merit to recommend it, may be said to have"], [227, "SECT. 34. 209 MODERN HISTORY. sunk into neglect and oblivion, in the fourteenth century.] 8. Contemporary with [Petrarch and Boc cacio,] and of rival merit, was the English Chaucer, who displays all the talents of the latter, through the medium of excellent poetry. The works of Chaucer discover an extensive knowledge of the sciences, an acquaintance both with ancient and modern learning, particularly the literature of France and Italy, and, above all, a most acute discernment of life and manners. [He had visited many parts of the Continent, particularly Italy, was personally acquainted with Petrarch, and in all likelihood with Boccacio.] 9. Of similar character are the poems of Gower, [the master of Chaucer, as he calls him self,] but of a graver cast, and a more chastened morality. [Chaucer has characterised him as the \" moral Gower .-\" his great work, the Confessio Amantis, contained nearly thirty-five thousand lines, and is said to have been written by the desire of King Richard II., between the years 1377 and 1393.] Equal to these eminent men, in every species of literary merit, was the ac complished James I. of Scotland, of which his remaining writings bear convincing testimony. VOL. II. p"], [228, "210 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. The doubtful Rowley of Bristol is said to have adorned the fifteenth century. 10. Spain, at this period, began to emerge from ignorance and barbarism, and to produce a few of those works which are enumerated with appro bation in the whimsical but judicious criticism of Cervantes. (D. Quixote, B. 1. c. 6.) [The romance of the Cid, the hero of the Spaniards, was more ancient than the Divina Comedia of Dante, by as much as one hundred and fifty years.] 11. But although poetry attained in those ages a considerable degree of splendour, there was but little advancement in general literature and science. History was disgraced by the in termixture of miracle and fable ; though we find much curious information in the writings of Matthew of Westminster, of Walsingham, Eve rard, Duysburg, and the Chronicles of Froissart and Monstrelet. Philip de Commines happily de scribes the reign of Lewis XL and Charles VIIL of France. Villani and Platina are valuable re corders of the affairs of Italy. 12. A taste for classical learning in the fifteenth century led to the discovery of many of the an cient authors. Poggio discovered the writings of Quintilian, and several of the compositions of"], [229, "SECT. 34. 211 MODERN HISTORY. Cicero, which stimulated to farther research, and the recovery of many valuable remains of Greek and Roman literature. But this taste was not generally diffused. France and England were extremely barbarous. The library at Ox ford contained only 600 volumes, and there were but four classics in the Royal Library at Paris. But a brighter period was approaching. The dispersion of the Greeks, on the fall of the Eastern empire, towards the middle of the fif teenth century, diffused a taste for polite litera ture over all the west of Europe. A succession of Popes, endowed with a liberal and enlight ened spirit, gave every encouragement to learn ing and the sciences ; and, above all, the noble discovery of the Art of Printing, [by movable types,] contributed to their rapid advancement and dissemination, and gave a certain assurance of the perpetuation of every valuable art, and the progressive improvement of human know ledge. [A Psalter, printed in Mentz in the year 1457, is the first book which appears to have been printed with a certain date.] 13. The rise of dramatic composition among the moderns is to be traced to the absurd and ludicrous representation in the churches of the Scripture histories, called in England Mysteries, p 2"], [230, "212 PART II, MODERN HISTORY. Miracles, and Moralities. These were first ex- hibited in the twelfth century, [as has been be- fore shown,] and continued to the sixteenth, when in England they were prohibited by law. Of these we have amusing specimens in Warton's History of English Poetry. Profane dramas were substituted in their place ; and a mixture of the sacred and profane appears to have been known in France as early as 1300. In Spain, the far cical mysteries keep their ground to the present day ; nor was it till the end of the sixteenth cen tury that any regular composition for the stage was known in that country. The Italians are allowed by their own writers to have borrowed their theatre from the French and English. XXXV. VIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE IN EUROPE BEFORE THE PORTUGUESE DISCOVERIES. 1. Before giving an account of the disco veries of the Portuguese in the fifteenth century, in exploring a new route to India, we shall pre sent a short view of the progress of commerce in Europe down to that period."], [231, "SECT. 35. 213 MODERN HISTORY. The boldest naval enterprise of the ancients was the Periplus of Hanno, who sailed (570 B. C.) from Carthage to the coast of Guinea, within four or five degrees of the line. Africa was not known by the ancients to be almost circumnavi gable. They had a very limited knowledge of the habitable earth. They believed that both the torrid and frigid zones were uninhabitable ; and they were but very imperfectly acquainted with a great part of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Poland, the greatest part of Russia, were unknown to them. In Ptolemy's description of the globe, the 63d de gree of latitude is the limit of the earth to the North, the equinoctial to the South. 2. Britain was circumnavigated in the time of Domitian. The Romans frequented it for the purposes of commerce ; and Tacitus mentions London as a celebrated resort of merchants. The commerce of the ancients was, however, chiefly confined to the Mediterranean. In the flourishing periods of the Constantinopolitan empire, the merchandise of India was imported from Alexandria; but, after the conquest of Egypt by the Arabians, it was carried up the Indus, and thence by land to the Qxus, which then ran into the Caspian Sea; thence it was p 3"], [232, "214 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. brought up the Wolga, and again carried over land to the Don, whence it descended into the Euxine. 3. After the fall of the Western empire, commerce was long at a stand in Europe ; [al most confined, indeed, to the capital of the East ern empire, which had alone been sufficiently strong to defy the assaults of the barbarians, and which was so situated as to be almost ne cessarily commercial.] When Attila was ravag ing Italy, the Veneti took refuge in the small islands at the northern extremity of the Adriatic, and there founded Venice, A.D. 452, which began very early to equip small fleets, [its only resource,] and trade to the coasts of Egypt and the Levant, for spices and other merchandise of Arabia and India. Genoa, Florence, and Pisa, imitated the example [of Venice], and began, [though a whole century later,] to acquire con siderable wealth ; but Venice retained her supe riority over these rival states, [though forced at one time, by the progress of the Saracens, to go to Constantinople instead of Alexandria, for In dian and Chinese commodities ;] she gained also considerable territories on the opposite coast of Illyricum and Dalmatia. [Florence, indeed, till after her acquisition of the port of Leghorn in"], [233, "SECT. 35. 215 MODERN HISTORY. 1425, was enriched not by her maritime trade so much as by her manufactures and dealings in bills of exchange.] 4. The maritime cities of Italy profited by the crusades, in furnishing the armies with sup plies, and bringing home the produce of the East. The Italian merchants established manu factures similar to those of Constantinople. Rogero, King of Sicily, brought artisans from Athens, and established a silk manufacture at Palermo in 1130. The sugar-cane, [mel-arundi naceum, or reed-honey, as it was at first called, and which, as well as silk, came originally from China,] was planted in Sicily in the twelfth cen tury, and thence carried to Madeira, and finally made its way to the West Indies. 5. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Italians were the only commercial people of Europe. [When the Genoese had succeeded in subverting the Latin and restoring the Eastern dynasty of Eastern princes, the Venetians quitted Constantinople, and being able to return to their original channel of communication with India by the ports of Egypt and Syria, towards the close of the fourteenth century, fully reco vered their ascendancy in Italy, Genoa declining in proportion.] Venice set the first example of p 4"], [234, "216 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. a national bank in 1157, which maintained its credit for a great length of time. The only trade of France, Spain, and Germany, at this time, was carried on at stated fairs and markets, to which traders resorted from all quarters, paying a tax to the sovereigns or the lords of the territory. The more enterprising bought a privilege of ex emption, by paying at once a large sum, and were thence called Free Traders. 6. In the middle ages, the Italian merchants, usually called Lombards, [as occupying or be longing to the principal towns of northern Italy,] were the factors of all the European nations, and were enticed, by privileges granted by the sove reigns, to settle in France, Spain, Germany, and England. They were not only traders in com modities, but bankers, or money -dealers ; but they found in this last business a severe restraint from the Canon law, prohibiting the taking of interest ; and hence, from the necessary privacy of their bargains, there were no bounds to ex orbitant usury. The Jews, too, who were, [of necessity,] the chief dealers in money, [being not only precluded from all other callings, but in a great measure free of the law alluded to, being permitted to take interest of strangers,] brought disrepute on the trade oi banking, and frequently"], [235, "SECT. 35. MODERN HISTORY. 217 suffered, on that account, the most intolerable persecution and confiscation of their fortunes. To guard against these injuries, they invented Bills of Exchange. 7. The Lombard merchants awakened a spirit of commerce, and gave birth to manufactures, which were generally encouraged by the sove reigns in the different kingdoms of Europe. Among the chief encouragements was the insti tution of corporations or monopolies, the earliest of which are traced up to the eleventh century ; a policy beneficial and perhaps necessary where the spirit of industry is low, and manufactures are in their infancy, but of hurtful consequence where trade and manufactures are flourishing. 8. Commerce began to spread towards the north of Europe about the end of the twelfth century. The sea-ports on the Baltic traded with France and Britain, and with the Mediter ranean, by the staple of the Isle of Oleron, near the mouth of the Garonne, then possessed by the English. The commercial laws ot' Oleron and Wisbuy (on the Baltic) regulated for many ages the trade of Europe. To protect their trade from piracy, Lubec, Hamburgh, and most of the northern sea-ports, joined in a confederacy, under certain general regulations, termed the"], [236, "218 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. League of the Hanse-Towns ; an union so be neficial in its nature, and so formidable in point of strength, as to have its alliance courted by the predominant powers of Europe. [It seems to have attained its highest state of prosperity about the year 1370.] 9. For the trade of the Hanse-towns with the southern kingdoms, Bruges, on the coast of Flanders, was found a convenient entrep6t, and thither the Mediterranean merchants brought the commodities of India and the Levant, to ex change with the produce and manufactures of the North. [But there was an interior land commerce carried on at the same time, and which subsisted till the discovery of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope. The connection was formed through the cities of Augsburgh and Nuremburgh, which had an em porium at Venice.] The Flemings now began to encourage trade and manufactures, which thence spread to the Brabanters ; but their growth being checked by the impolitic sove reigns of those provinces, they found a more favourable field in England, which was destined thence to derive the great source of its national opulence. 10. The Britons had very early seen the im-"], [237, "SECT. 35. MODERN HISTORY. 219 portance of commerce. Bede relates that Lon- don, in 614, was frequented by foreigners for I the purpose of trade ; and William of Malmes- bury speaks of it, in 1041, as a most populous and wealthy city. The Cinque Ports, Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney, and Sandwich, ob- tained in that age their privileges and immuni- ties, on condition of furnishing each five ships of war. These ports are now eight in number, and send their members to Parliament. 11. The woollen manufacture of England was considerable in the twelfth century. Henry II. incorporated the weavers of London, and gave them various privileges. By a law passed in his reign, all cloth made of foreign wool was con demned to be burnt. Scotland at this time seems to have possessed a considerable source of wealth, as is evident from the payment of the ransom of William the Lion, which was 10,000 merks, equal to 100,000/. sterling of present money. The English found it difficult to raise double that sum for the ransom of Richard I., and the Scots con tributed a proportion of it.

The herring-fishery, [which had been known and practised many centuries before, even in the time of David L, contempo rary with Henry I. and Stephen of England,] then began to be vigorously promoted ; and the duties laid on the exportation of woollen cloth show that this manufacture was then considerable among the Scots. Glasgow began, in 1420, to acquire wealth by the fisheries, but had little or no foreign trade till after the discovery of America and the W'est Indies. 12. Henry VII. gave the most liberal encour agement to trade and manufactures, particularly the woollen, by inviting foreign artisans, and es tablishingthem at Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax, &c. The navigation-acts were passed in his reign, and commercial treaties formed with the conti nental kingdoms for the protection of the mer chant-shipping.

XXXVI. DISCOVERIES OF THE PORTUGUESE IN THE FIF- TEENTH CENTURY, AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE COMMERCE OF EUROPE. 1. The polarity of the magnet had been known in Europe as early as the [twelfth and] thirteenth centuries, [and applied both in the north and south to the purposes of na vigation, either in the twelfth or early in the thirteenth century; the Norwegians appearing at that period to have used the compass in their voyages to and from Iceland, and an old Pro ven9al poet, who wrote in the twelfth century, having clearly and minutely described it, as used by the Provencal mariners in the Mediterranean. In the middle of the fourteenth century, it appears to have been known in Scotland, but it was not till the fifteenth that the European mariners ventured to depart far from the land.] The Eastern ocean was little otherwise known than by name ; and the Atlantic was supposed to be a boundless expanse of sea, extending"], [241, "SECT. 36. 223 MODERN HISTORY. probably to the eastern shores of Asia. In the belief that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, a promontory on the African coast, in the 29th degree of north latitude, was termed Cape Non, as forming an impassable limit. 2. In the beginning of the fifteenth century, John, King of Portugal, sent a few vessels to ex plore the African coast ; and these, doubling Cape Non, proceeded to Cape Boyador, within two degrees of the northern tropic. Prince Henry, the son of John, [who had been engaged in the memorable siege of Ceuta in Africa, and being not only of a curious and inquisitive turn of mind, but strongly bent upon enriching his country, by means of navigation and discovery, is supposed to have acquired much information there concerning that continent,] equipped first a single ship, which, being driven out to sea, landed on the island of Porto Santo. This in voluntary experiment imboldened the mariners to abandon their timid mode of coasting, and launch into the open sea. In 1420, [the same prince sent out three ships, two of which, ventur ing into the ocean,] discovered Madeira, where the Portuguese established a colony, and planted the Cyprus vine and the sugar-cane. 3. The spirit of enterprise thus awakened,"], [242, "224 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Prince Henry obtained from Eugene IV. a bull, granting to the Portuguese the property of all the countries they might discover between Cape Non and India. Under John I. of Portugal, the Cape Verd Islands were discovered and colonised ; and the fleets, advancing to the coast of Guinea, fortunately brought home gold-dust, gums, and ivory, [which had the effect of stimu- lating the avarice of the Portuguese to greater exertions than the patriotism of their prince could do.] Passing the equator, [in 1484,] the Portuguese, [under Bartholomew Diaz,] entered a new hemisphere, and boldly proceeded to the extremity of the continent, [passing round even the southern Cape^of Africa, which they called the Cape of Storms.] In 1497, a. fleet under Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape [again, which the King himself had now denominated, with singular propriety, the Cape of Good Hope,] and, sailing onwards beyond the mouths of the Arabian and Persian Gulfs, [encouraged, as it has been al- leged, by the representations of one of the King's subjects, who had gained such information in Abyssinia as led him to conclude and represent to his sovereign that such a passage to India was practicable,] arrived at Calicut, on the"], [243, "SECT. 36. MODERN HISTORY. 225 Malabar coast, after a voyage of 1500 leagues, performed in thirteen months. 4. De Gama entered into an alliance with the Rajah of Calicut, a tributary of the Mogul empire, and returned to Lisbon with specimens of the wealth and produce of the country. A succeeding fleet formed settlements ; and, van quishing the opposition of the native princes, soon achieved the conquest of all the coast of Malabar. The city of Goa, taken by storm, be came the residence of a Portuguese viceroy, and the capital of their Indian settlements. 5. The Venetians, who had hitherto engrossed the Indian trade by Alexandria, now lost it for ever. After an ineffectual project of cutting through the isthmus of Suez, they attempted to intercept the Portuguese by their fleets stationed at the mouth of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, but were every where encountered by a superior force. The Portuguese made settlements in both the gulfs, and vigorously prosecuted their conquests on the Indian coast and sea. The rich island of Ceylon, the kingdoms of Pegu, Siam, and Malacca, were speedily subdued, and a settlement established in Bengal.

In the space of fifty years the Portuguese were masters of the whole trade of the Indian Ocean, and sovereigns of a large extent of Asiatic territory. 6. These discoveries [which were so timed as probably to rescue the Indian trade out of the hands of the Mahometans, who by their progress in the East, and the footing they had now got in Europe by the conquest of Constantinople, might otherwise have totally excluded the Chris tian powers,] produced a wonderful effect on the commerce of Europe. The produce of the spice islands was computed to be worth annually 200,000 ducats to Lisbon. The Venetians, after every effort to destroy the trade of the Portuguese, offered to become sole purchasers of all the spice brought to Europe, but were refused. [By the new channel, in fact, the Portuguese were able to supply Europe with the commodities of the East at a rate, as it has been computed, less by one half of that at which they had been sold by the Venetians.] Com mercial industry was roused in every quarter, and manufactures made a rapid progress.

The former owed its splendour to the decline of Bruges, which [at the beginning of the sixteenth century] was ruined by civil commotions ; and the Portuguese made Antwerp, 1516, their en trepot for the supply of the northern kingdoms. It continued highly flourishing, [embracing, in fact, the whole commerce of the world,] till the revolt of the Netherlands, in the end of the six teenth century, when it was taken by the Spa niards, 1585, and its port destroyed by blocking up the Scheldt. [It may deserve to be noticed, that without the contemporary discovery of America, (see below, Sect. XLI.) it would have been scarcely possible to have carried the Indian trade to the extent it soon attained, for want of a sufficient supply of the precious metals ; the people of the East, through their industry and the fertility of their country, having, from the first, stood little in need of the productions of other countries.] 7. The trade of Holland rose on the fall of Antwerp. Amsterdam, [which early in the fif teenth century became a sea-port, in conse quence of a remarkable inundation which opened q 2"], [246, "228 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. the Zuyder Zee to the ocean,] had become considerable after the decline of the Hanseatic confederacy in 1428, but rose into splendour and high commercial opulence from the de struction of Antwerp. [The Spanish or Catholic Netherlands by this act lost their trade and manufactures,] and the United Provinces, de pendent on industry alone for their support, became a model of commercial activity to all other nations. [As soon as Philip the Second had obtained possession of Portugal in 1580, he put a stop to the commerce between Lisbon and the Dutch, which had no other effect than that of exciting the latter to open for themselves a trade to India, in which they were successful, dispos sessing the Portuguese of many of their principal settlements, and from the year 1602 establishing a sovereignty in those distant parts which lasted till they themselves were disturbed by the English.] 8. It is not to be doubted that Britain felt the effect of that general stimulus which the Portuguese discoveries gave to the trade of Europe ; but other causes had a more sensible operation to that end in England. The Re formation, by suppressing the convents, and re storing many thousands to society, and the cutting"], [247, "SECT. 36.

From the time of Henry VIIL to the present, the commerce and manufactures of England have been uniformly progressive. The rental of England in lands and houses did not then exceed five millions per annum ; it is now above eighteen millions.* The unmanufactured wool of one year's growth is supposed to be worth two millions ; when manufactured, as it now is, by British hands, instead of being sent abroad as formerly for that purpose, it is worth eight millions.

It is pre sumable, on the whole, that nearly a fourth of the population of the United Kingdom is actu ally employed in commerce and manufactures. 10. The vast increase of the national wealth of Britain appears chiefly, 1. From the increase of population, which is supposed to be nearly five to one (at least in the large cities) since the reign of Elizabeth ; 2. From the great addition made to the cultivated lands of the kingdom, and the high improvement of agriculture since that period, whence more than quadruple the quantity of food is produced ; 3. From the in crease of the commercial shipping, at least six fold within the same time ; 4. From the compa rative low rate of interest, which is demonstrative of the increase of wealth. The consequences of the diffusion of the commercial spirit are most important to the national welfare : from general industry arises influence, joined to a spirit of independence ; and on this spirit rests the free dom of the British constitution, and all the blessings we enjoy under its protection."], [249, "SECT. 37. MODERN HISTORY. 231 XXXVII. GERMANY AND FRANCE IN THE REIGNS OF CHARLES V. AND FRANCIS I. 1. We resume the detail of the history of Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth cen tury ; previously remarking, that the Germanic empire continued for above fifty years in a state of languid tranquillity, from the time of Al bert II., the successor of Sigismund, during the long reign of Frederick III., whose son Maxi milian acquired, by his marriage with Mary Duchess of Burgundy, the sovereignty of the Netherlands. Maximilian was elected emperor in 1493 ; and, by establishing a perpetual peace between the separate Germanic states, laid the foundation of the subsequent grandeur of the empire. V 2. Philip Archduke of Austria, son of Maxi milian, married Jane, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella [of Spain] ; and of that marriage the eldest son was Charles V., who succeeded to the throne of Spain in 1516, and who, on the death of his grandfather Maximilian, pre- q 4"], [250, "232 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. ferred [his claim to the vacant Imperial throne. He had for his competitor Francis I. of France, who had distinguished himself by the conquest of the Milanese, and the adjustment of the con tending interests of the Italian states. The German electors, afraid of the exorbitant power both of Charles and of Francis, would have re jected both, and conferred the Imperial crown on Frederick Duke of Saxony ; but this extraor dinary man declined the proffered dignity, and his counsel determined the election in favour of Charles of Austria, 1519. 3. Charles V. and Francis I. were now de clared enemies, and their mutual claims on each other's dominions were the subject of per petual hostility. The Emperor claimed Artois as part of the Netherlands. Francis prepared to make good his right to the Two Sicilies. Charles had to defend Milan, and support his title to Navarre, which had been wrested from France by his grandfather Ferdinand. .Hen ry VIIL of England was courted by the rival monarchs, as the weight of England was suffi cient to turn the scale, where the power of each was nearly balanced. [Leo X. would fain have interposed between the rivals, but they were both too great to be under his controul.] 4. The first hostile attack was made by"], [251, "SECT. 37. MODERN HISTORY. 233 Francis on the kingdom of Navarre, which he won and lost in the course of a few months. The Emperor attacked Picardy, and his troops at the same time drove the French out of the Milanese. On the death of Leo X., Charles placed [his preceptor] Cardinal Adrian on the papal throne, 1521, [though a native of Utrecht, and almost a stranger at Rome ;] and by the promise of elevating Wolsey, the minister of Henry VIIL, to that dignity, on the death of Adrian, gained the alliance of the English mo narch in his war against France. [He also found means of detaching Venice and Genoa from the interests of his competitor.] 5. At this critical time, [when he had not only almost all Europe against him, but was in want of money,] Francis imprudently quarrelled with his best General, the Constable of Bourbon, who, in revenge, deserted to the Emperor, and was by him invested with the chief command of his armies. The Imperial [and Italian] Generals [under him, for most of the princes of Italy were adverse to the government of France,] were far superior in abilities to their opponents. [Their troops, also, were superior, more nu merous, and better paid.] The French were defeated at Biagrassa, and Charles was carrying every thing before him in Italy, when Francis"], [252, "234 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. entered the Milanese, and retook the capital ; [some changes having taken place in his favour, by the defection of the new Pope, Clement VII., from the party of Charles, as well as of John de Medici, one of the best Generals of those days.] But, in the subsequent battle of Pavia, [though he displayed the utmost valour,] his troops were entirely defeated, and the French monarch became the Constable of Bourbon's prisoner, 1525. [It was upon this occasion that he wrote to his mother, \" Madam, all is lost but my \" honour.\"] 6. The Emperor made no advantage of his good fortune, [strangely, indeed, neglected all that offered.] By the treaty of Madrid, Francis regained his liberty, [in the following year,] on yielding to Charles the duchy of Burgundy, and the superiority of Flanders and Artois. He gave his two sons as hostages for the fulfilment of these conditions ; but the states refused to ratify them, and the failure was compromised for a sum of money. 7. On a renewal of the war, Henry VIIL took part with France, and Charles lost an op portunity of obtaining the sovereignty of Italy. The papal army in the French interest was defeated by the Constable of Bourbon, and the Pope himself made prisoner ; but Bourbon was"], [253, "SECT. 37. MODERN HISTORY. 235 killed in the siege of Rome, [which he had wantonly, and in defiance of a stipulated truce, attacked,] and Charles allowed the Pope to purchase his release. 8. After the conclusion of the peace of Cam bray, 1529, [which restored to the two sons of Francis their liberty, and to the King their father the duchy of Burgundy,] Charles visited Italy, and received the Imperial diadem from Pope Clement VII., [disposing of the different states of Lombardy to various princes for what money he could get.] The Turks having invaded Hungary, the Emperor marched against them in person, [assisted by his brother Ferdinand,] and compelled the Sultan Solyman, with an army of 300,000 men, to evacuate the country. He soon after embarked for Africa, to replace the dethroned Muley Hassan in the sovereignty of Tunis and Algiers, which had been usurped by Hayradin Barbarossa, and he achieved the enterprise with honour. His reputation ex ceeded at this period that of all the sovereigns of Europe, both for political ability, for real power, and the extent and opulence of his do minions ; [but he had a hard task upon his hands, having at one and the same time to guard against the Turks and the French, and the latter both on the north and the south.]"], [254, "236 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 9. Francis was glad to ally himself even with the Turks to cope with the Imperialists, and Barbarossa invaded Italy ; but the troops of Charles prevented the co-operation of the French, and separately defeated and dispersed the allied powers, while another army of the Imperialists ravaged Champagne and Picardy. 10. In the interval of a truce, which was concluded at Nice for ten years between the rival monarchs, Charles passed through France to the Netherlands, and was entertained by Francis with the most magnificent hospitality. He had promised to grant to the French king his favourite desire, the investiture of Milan ; but, failing to keep his word, the war was re newed with double animosity. The French and Turkish fleets attacked Nice, but were dis persed by the Genoese admiral, Andrea Doria, [a person whose name is justly celebrated in history as the restorer of the liberties of his country.] In Italy the French were victorious in the battle of Cerizoles, but drew no benefit from this partial advantage. The Imperialists, on the whole, had a decided superiority, and France must have been undone, had not the disorders of Germany, from the contending interests of the Catholics and Protestants, forced the Emperor to conclude the treaty of Crepi"], [255, "SECT. 37. MODERN HISTORY. 237 with Francis, 1544 ; who, at the same time, purchased a peace with Henry VIIL, who had once more taken part with his rival. Francis died soon after, 1547 ; a prince of great spirit and abilities, and of a generous and noble mind, [if we make allowances for some strange incon sistencies into which he was betrayed by his politics ;] unfortunate only from the necessity of struggling against a power which overmatched him both in policy and in resources. 11. A short time before this period was founded (1535) the order of the Jesuits by Ignatius Loyola ; [though not confirmed by Papal authority till the year 1540 :] the principle of the order was implicit obedience and submis sion to the Pope. The brethren were not con fined to their cloisters, but allowed to mix with the world ; and thus, by [becoming confessors in most of the courts and capitals of Europe, and so] gaining the confidence of princes and statesmen, they were enabled to direct the policy of nations to the great end of establishing the supreme authority of the Holy See. The wealth they accumulated, the extent of their power, and the supposed consequences of their intrigues to the peace of nations, excited at length a general hostility to their order; and the institution, [during the course of the last"], [256, "238 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. century, was] abolished in all the kingdoms of Europe. [It has since been partially revived.] 12. If Charles V. aimed at universal empire, he was ever at a distance from the object of his wishes. The formidable confederacy of the Protestants to preserve their liberties and their re ligion, gave him perpetual disquiet in Germany. He never could form his dominions into a well connected body, from the separate national in terests of the Spaniards, Flemish, and Germans ; and even the Imperial states were divided by their jealousies, political and religious. The hostilities of foreign powers gave him continual annoyance. He found in Henry II., the suc cessor of Francis, an antagonist as formidable as his father. His cares and difficulties in creased as he advanced in life, and at length entirely broke the vigour of his mind. In a state of melancholy despondency, he retired from the world at the age of fifty-six, resigning first the kingdom of Spain to his son Philip II., 1556, and afterwards the Imperial crown in favour of his brother Ferdinand, who was elected Emperor 24th February, 1558 ; [soon after which Charles died, in the monastery to which he had retired on the confines of Castille and Portugal, after having gone through one of the most ex traordinary mock ceremonies that ever perhaps"], [257, "SECT. 38. MODERN HISTORY. 239 entered into the imagination of man, namely, his own funeral.] XXXVIII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE. 1. Previous to the reign of Maximilian L, the Germanic empire was subject to all the dis orders of the feudal governments. The general diets of the states were tumultuous and in decisive, and their constant wars with each other kept the whole in anarchy and barbarism. Wenceslaus, in 1383, endeavoured to remedy these evils by the enactment of a general peace ; but no effectual means were taken for securing it. Albert II. attempted to accomplish the same end, and had some success. He divided Germany into six circles, each regulated by its own diet ; but the jealousies of the states prompted them constantly to hostilities, which there was no superior power sufficient to restrain. 2'. At length Maximilian I. procured, in 1500, that solemn enactment which established a per petual peace among the Germanic states, under the cogent penalty of the aggressor being"], [258, "240 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. treated as a common enemy. He established the Imperial Chamber for the settlement of all differences. [It was fixed at Worms in 1495 ; in 1533 it was removed to Spires, and in 1696 to Weslar.] The empire was divided anew into ten circles, each sending its representatives to the Imperial Chamber, and bound to enforce the public laws through its own territory. A regency was appointed to subsist in the intervals of the diet, composed of twenty members, over whom the Emperor presided. [According to the division of Maximilian, therefore, the empire consisted of the circles of Bavaria, Franconia, Suabia, the Lower Saxony, the Lower Rhine, Westphalia, Austria, Burgundy, the Upper Saxony, and the Upper Rhine. The circle of Burgundy comprised the High Burgundy or Franche-Comte and the seventeen provinces of the Low Countries ; but this latter circle was, by degrees, completely dismembered from the empire, so that the number of the circles was reduced to nine.] 3. These regulations, however wise, would probably have failed of their end, but for the influence of the house of Austria, which has for three centuries continued to occupy the Imperial throne. The ambition and policy of Charles V. would have been dangerous to the freedom of"], [259, "SECT. 38. MODERN HISTORY. 241 the German princes, had not the new system of preserving a balance of power in Europe made these princes find allies and protectors sufficient to traverse the Emperor's schemes of absolute dominion. He attained, however, an authority far beyond that of any of his predecessors. The succeeding emperors imitated his policy, but without his talents, and therefore found yet stronger obstacles to their encroachments on the freedom of the states. 4. The Germanic liberties were settled for the last time by the treaty of Westphalia, in 1648, which fixed the Emperor's prerogatives, and the privileges of the states. * The con stitution of the empire is not framed for the ordinary ends of government, the prosperity and happiness of the people. It regards not the rights of the subjects, but only the independ ence of the several princes ; and its sole object is to maintain each in the enjoyment of its sovereignty, and prevent usurpations, and en croachments on each other's territories. It has no relation to the particular government of the states, each of which has its own laws and con- \u00a3* For an account of the Germanic confederation, as settled by the treaty of Vienna, 1815, subsequent to the French Revolution, see the conclusion of Vol. III.] VOL. II. R"], [260, "242 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. stitution, some more free, and others more despotic. 5. The general diet has the power of enacting the public laws of the empire. It consists of three Colleges, [established at Frankfort in the year 1580,] the Electors, the Princes, [Ecclesi astic and Secular,] and the Free [or Imperial] cities. All such public laws, and all general measures, are the subject of the separate deli beration of the electoral college and that of the princes. When jointly approved by them, the resolution is canvassed by the college of the Free Cities, and, if agreed to, becomes a placi tum of the empire. If approved finally by the Emperor, it is a conclusum or general law. If disapproved, the resolution is of no effect. Moreover, the Emperor must be the proposer of all general laws. Still further, no complaint or request can be made by any of the princes to the diet without the approbation of the Elector Archbishop of Mentz, who may refuse it at his pleasure. These constitutional defects are the more hurtful in their consequences from the separate and often contending interests of the princes, who have all the rights of sovereignty, the power of contracting foreign alliances, and"], [261, "SECT. 38. 243 MODERN HISTORY. are frequently possessed of foreign dominions of far greater value than their Imperial territories. 6. The Germanic constitution has, however, in some respects its advantages. The particular diets of each circle tend to unite those princes in all matters of national concern, whatever may be the discordance of their individual interests. The regulations made in those diets make up for the want of a general legislative power. Besides the circular diets, the Electors, the Princes, the Free Cities, the Catholics, and the Protestants, hold their particular diets, when their common interests require it; and these powers balance each other. Considered, there fore, solely in the light of a league of several independent princes and states associating for their common benefit, the Germanic constitu tion has many advantages, in promoting general harmony, securing the rights of its members, and preventing the weak from being oppressed by the strong. R 2"], [262, "244 MODERN HISTORY. PART II, XXXIX. OF THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY AND SWIT- ZERLAND, AND THE REVOLUTION IN DENMARK AND SWEDEN. 1. The age of Charles V. is the era of the Reformation of religion, of the discovery of the New World, and of the highest splendour of the fine arts in Italy and the south of Europe. We shall treat in order of each of these great objects ; and, first, of the Reformation. The voluptuous taste and the splendid pro jects of [the celebrated John de Medici,] Pope Leo X., demanding large supplies of money, he instituted through all the Christian kingdoms a sale of indulgences, or remittances from the pains of purgatory. [The term was originally applied to a mere exemption from taxes : by the bishops of the twelfth century they were granted as dis charges from civil or ecclesiastical punishments ; but when monopolised by the popes, they were carried to that exorbitant pitch of being sup posed to convey a full remission of sins, past, pre-"], [263, "SECT. 39. 245 MODERN HISTORY. sent, and to come, here and hereafter.] This traffic being abused to the most shocking pur poses, Martin Luther, an Augustine friar, [about the year 1517,] took upon him to preach against it, and to inveigh with acrimony against the power which authorised it. He found many willing hearers, particularly in the electorate of Saxony, of which the Prince Frederick was his friend and protector ; [that wise Prince, who, on the death of Maximilian, 1519, had the mag nanimity to refuse the Imperial diadem. (See supra, Sect. XXXVII. \u00a7 2.)] Leo X. con demned his tenets by a Papal bull, which only increased the zeal and indignation of the preacher. In a book he published, called the Babylonish Captivity, he applied all the scrip tural attributes of the whore of Babylon to the Papal hierarchy, and attacked with equal force and virulence the doctrines of transubstantiation, purgatory, the celibacy of the priests, and the refusal of wine in the communion to the people. The book being condemned to the flames, Luther took upon him to burn the Pope's bull and the decretals at Wittemberg, 1520. 2. One of the first champions who took up the pen against Luther was Henry VIIL of England, [who had had, in the course of his r 3"], [264, "246 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. education, his mind and attention a good deal turned to the scholastic divinity and disputations of the times, and] whose book, presented to Pope Leo, procured him the title, from that time annexed to the crown, of Defender of the Faith. The rest of Europe seemed to pay little atten tion to these rising controversies, [Germany and Switzerland excepted, which soon became the chief theatres of the commotions that took place.] Charles V., studious of the friendship of the Pope, took part against Luther, [though whether with much sincerity has been questioned,] and sum moned him to answer for his doctrines before the Imperial diet of Worms. The Reformer, [having the Emperor's safe-conduct, repaired to the assembly, where he] defended himself with great spirit, and, aided by his friend the Elector, made a safe escape into Saxony, where the mass was now universally abolished, the images destroyed, and the convents shut up. The friars and nuns returned to the world, and Luther took a nun for his wife. Nor did these secularised priests abuse their new freedom, for their manners were decent, and their life exem plary. 3. Erasmus has justly censured the impolicy of the Catholic clergy in their modes of resist-"], [265, "ECT. 39- MODERN HISTORY. 247 ing and suppressing the new doctrines. They allowed them to be discussed in sermons before the people, and employed for that purpose furious and bigotted declaimers, who only in creased and widened differences. They would not yield in the most insignificant trifle, nor ac knowledge a single fault ; and they persecuted with the utmost cruelty all whose opinions were not agreeable to their own standard of faith. How wise is the counsel of Lord Bacon ! \" There is no better way to stop the rise of \" new sects and schisms than to reform abuses, \" compound the lesser differences, proceed \" mildly from the first, refrain from sanguinary \" persecutions, and rather to soften and win \" the principal leaders, by gracing and ad \" vancing them, than to enrage them by vio \" lence and bitterness.\" (Bac. Mor. Ess. Sect. 1. Ess. 12.) 4. Switzerland followed in the path of re formation. Zuinglius of Zurich preached forth the new tenets, [not, however, exactly upon the same grounds as Luther,] with such zeal and effect, that the whole canton were his converts, and the senate publicly abolished the mass, and purified the churches. Berne took the same measures with yet greater solemnity, after a dis- R 4"], [266, "248 BIODERN HISTORY. PART II. cussion in the senate which lasted two months. Bale imitated the same example. Five of the other cantons armed in defence of their faith ; and in a desperate engagement, in which the Protestants were defeated, Zuinglius was slain, 1531. 5. Lutheranism was now making its progress towards the north of Europe. Sweden, Den- mark, and Norway, were at this time governed by Christiern II., the Nero of the north. The Swedes, reluctantly submitting to the yoke, were kept in awe by Troll, Archbishop of Upsal, a faithful minister of the tyrant in all his schemes \u25a0of oppression and cruelty. On intelligence of a Tevolt,' the King and his primate, armed with a bull from Pope Leo X., [repaired to Stockholm, and there] massacred the whole body of the nobles and senators, amidst the festivity of a banquet. Gustavus Vasa, [whose father was amongst the first who suffered,] grand-nephew of Charles Canutson, formerly King of Sweden, escaped from this carnage, and concealed himself in the mines of Dalecarlia.

The bull of Leo X., and its bloody consequences, Avere suf ficient to convert Sweden and Denmark to the tenets of the reformed religion. [Gustavus wrought this change amongst his Swedish sub jects, and Frederic permitted the Danes to follow the example.] Gustavus enjoyed his sceptre many years in peace, [raised his country to a distinguished situation as a European power,] and contributed greatly to the happiness and prosperity of his kingdom. [Christiern the Second ended his days in a Danish prison ; and the archbishop, who had made himself the instrument of all his sovereign's tyrannical pro ceedings, actually died of wounds received in an engagement which he had excited the people of Lubeck to undertake against Denmark.] 6. As early as 1525, the states of Saxony, Brunswick, Hesse Cassel, and the cities of"], [268, "250 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. Strasburgh and Frankfort, had embraced the doctrines of the Reformation. Luther had now a species of spiritual control, which he exercised by the medium of a synod of six reformers. His successful example gave rise to reformers of different kinds, whose doctrines were less consonant to reason or good policy. Two fanatics of Saxony, Storck and Muncer, con- demned infant baptism (hence termed Anabap- tists). They preached up universal equality and freedom of religious opinion, but, with sin- gular inconsistency, attempted to propagate their doctrines by the sword. [Their doctrine of equality naturally armed the peasants in their favour, and with this rabble at their heels, they committed dreadful ravages.] They were, [how- ever, in no long course of time,] defeated at Mulhausen, and Muncer died on a scaffold ; but the party seemed to acquire new courage. They surprised Munster, expelled the bishop, and anointed for their king a tailor named Jack of Leyden, who defended the city [a whole year] with the most desperate courage, but fell at length with his party under the superior force of regular troops. [He did not lose his presence of mind upon being taken, but with the most ex traordinary fanaticism maintained to the last"], [269, "SECT. 39- MODERN HISTORY. 251 that he was a king by the grace of God. After being carried from town to town, and exhibited as a sight, the bishop ordered him to be put to death with red-hot pincers.] The Anabaptists, thus sanguinary in their original tenets and practices, have long ago become peaceable and harmless subjects. 7. The united power of the Pope and Emperor found it impossible to check the progress of the Reformation. The diet of Spires proposed articles of accommodation between the Lutherans and Catholics. Fourteen cities of Germany, and several of the Electors, protested formally against those articles ; and hence the Lutheran party acquired the name of Protestants. They presented to the Assembly at Augsburg a con fession of their faith, which is the standard of the Protestant doctrines. 8. The virtuous lives and conduct of the Protestant leaders, compared with those of the higher clergy among the Catholics, formed a contrast very favourable to the progress of the Reformation. The solemn manner in which the states of Switzerland, and particularly Ge neva, had proceeded, in calmly discussing every point of controversy, [in public disputations to which both Catholics and Protestants from all"], [270, "252 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. countries were invited,] and yielding only to the force of rational conviction, attracted the respect of all Europe. John Calvin, a French- man, [and whose name was properly Chauvin,] becoming a zealous convert to the new doc- trines, was the first who gave them a systematic form by his Institutions, and enforced their au- thority by the establishment of synods, consist- ories, and deacons. The magistracy of Geneva gave these ordinances the authority of the law ; and they were adopted by six of the Swiss can- tons, by the Protestants of France, and the Presbyterians of Scotland and England. The ablest advocates of Calvin will find it difficult to vindicate him from the charge of intolerance and the spirit of persecution : [erecting his sys- tem upon republican and even democratical principles, in some remarkable instances he betrayed the spirit of a tyrant.] But these, which are the vices or defects of the individual, attach not in the least to the doctrines of the Reformation, which are subject to the test of reason, and can derive no blemish or dishonour from the men who propagated them, or even the motives which might influence some of their earliest supports. This observation applies"], [271, "SECT. 40. MODERN HISTORY. 253 more particularly to the subject of the ensuing section. XL. OF THE REFORMATION IN ENGLAND UNDER HENRY VIII . AND HIS SUCCESSORS. 1. Wickliffe, in the middle of the fourteenth century, by an attack on the doctrines of tran substantiation, indulgences, and auricular con fession, and yet more by translation of the Scriptures into the vernacular tongue, had pre pared the minds of the people of England for a revolution in religious opinions ; but his pro fessed followers were not numerous. The in temperate passions of Henry VIIL were the immediate cause of the Reformation in England. He had been married for eighteen years to Catharine of Spain, aunt of Charles V., by whom he had three children, one of them Mary, after wards Queen of England ; when falling in love with Anna Bullen, he solicited Clement VII. for a divorce from Catharine on the score of her former marriage to his elder brother Arthur. The Pope found himself in the painful dilemma"], [272, "254 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. of either affronting the Emperor, or mortally offending the King of England ; [he must also have annulled or discredited the dispensation granted by his predecessor Julius II., who had especially allowed and sanctioned the marriage which Henry now wished to set aside ; and this could only have been done at a great risk of depreciating the Papal authority.] In hope that the King's passion might cool, he spun off the time by preliminaries and negociations, but to no purpose. Henry was resolutely bent on accomplishing his wishes. [Francis I. King of France supported the cause of Henry at Rome, on the ostensible grounds of relationship and alliance, but chiefly, it may be supposed, in oppo sition to his great rival Charles V.] The Sor bonne and other French Universities, however, gave an opinion in Henry's favour ; and armed with this sanction he caused Cranmer, Arch bishop of Canterbury, to annul his marriage, 1533. The repudiated Queen gave place to Anna Bullen. On this occasion Wolsey, the minister of Henry, lost the favour of his master, by opposing, as was believed, his darling measure. 2. Clement VII., from this specimen of the wayward temper of Henry, resolved to keep"], [273, "SECT. 40. 255 MODERN HISTORY. well with the Emperor, and issued his bull, condemnatory of the sentence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry immediately proclaimed himself Head of the Church of England ; the parliament ratified his title, [granted him the annates or first-fruits which had been paid to the Popes,] and the Papal authority was instantly suppressed in all his dominions, 1534. He pro ceeded to abolish the monasteries, and confis cate their treasures and revenues, erecting out of the latter six new bishoprics and a college. The immoralities of the monks were sedulously exposed, the forgery of relics, false miracles, &c. held up to the popular scorn. 3. Yet Henry, though a Reformer, and Pope in his own kingdom, had not renounced the religion of Rome ; he was equally an enemy to the tenets of Luther and Calvin, as to the Pope's jurisdiction in England. [In regard to the latter point he was so determined, that those who refused to take the oath of supremacy, in acknowledgment of his being Head of the Church, were speedily brought to the scaffold. The celebrated Sir Thomas More, and Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, who had been the King's preceptor, and was at the time eighty years of age, being among the earliest and most lamented"], [274, "256 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. victims.] Inconstant in his affections, and a stranger to all humanity, he removed Anna Bullen from the throne to the scaffold, to gratify a new passion for Jane Seymour, a maid of honour, who happily died about a year after. To her succeeded Anne of Cleves, whom he divorced in nine months, to make way for Ca tharine Howard. She underwent the same fate with Anna Bullen, on a similar suspicion of infidelity to his bed. His sixth wife, Catharine Parr, with difficulty retained her hazardous ele vation, but had the good fortune to survive the tyrant. 4. On the death of Henry VIIL, 1547, and the accession of his son Edward VI., the Pro testant religion prevailed in England, and was favoured by the Sovereign ; but he died at the early age of fifteen, 1553; and [aster a rash attempt to seat Lady Jane Grey, the daughter of the Duke of Suffolk, niece to Henry VIIL, on the throne,] the sceptre passed to the hands of his sister Mary, [daughter of Queen Catha rine,] an intolerant Catholic, and most cruel persecutor of the Protestants ; [a good deal pro voked thereto, no doubt, by the injurious treat ment her mother had received, and instigated to revenge by all the adherents of the ancient"], [275, "SECT. 40. 257 MODERN HISTORY. religion.] In her reign, which was but of five years' duration, above 800 miserable victims were burnt at a stake, martyrs to their religious opinions. Mary inherited a congenial spirit with her husband, Philip II. of Spain, whose intolerance cost him the loss of a third part of his dominions. 5. Mary was succeeded (1558) by her sister Elizabeth, the daughter of Anna Bullen, a Pro testant, and the more zealous from an abhor rence of the character of her predecessor. In her reign the religion of England became stationary. The hierarchy was established in its present form, by archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons, the King being by law the Head of the Church. The liturgy had been settled in the reign of Edward VI. : the canons are agreeable chiefly to the Lutheran tenets. Of the Reformation in Scotland we shall af terwards treat under a separate section. VOL. II. s"], [276, "258 MODERN HISTORY. PART II XLI. OF THE DISCOVERY AND CONQUEST OF AMERICA. 1. Among those great events which distin guished the age of Charles V., was the conquest of Mexico by Ferdinando Cortez, and of Peru by the Pizarros. The discovery of America had preceded the first of these events about twenty-seven years ; but we have postponed the mention of it till now, that the whole may be shortly treated in connection. Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, a man of enterprising spirit, [bred up to the sea from his earliest youth,] having in vain solicited encou- ragement from his native state, from Portugal, and from England, to attempt discoveries in the western seas, [hoping and expecting thereby to find a shorter passage to the Indies,] applied to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, \"who, [after a tedious suspense of seven years,] furnished him with three small ships, ninety men, and a few thousand ducats for the charges of his voyage. After thirty-three days' sail from the Canaries,"], [277, "SECT. 41. 259 MODERN HISTORY. he discovered, [in the year 1492,] San Salvador, and soon aster the islands of Cuba and Hispa niola; [but he had so little apprehension of the exact circumstances of his own discoveries, that he at first supposed he had arrived at the eastern side of Asia, and that he had only discovered a new passage to the countries visited by the Ve netian, Marco Paulo, in the thirteenth century. He appears to have been deceived by a geogra phical error of Ptolemy, who had miscalculated the distance between Europe and China to the amount of nearly three-fourths of the Pacific Ocean ; otherwise it would seem that Columbus was not ignorant of the old traditions concerning a western continent.] Returning [from his voyage,] accompanied with some of the natives, some presents in gold, and curiosities of the country, he was treated by the Spaniards with the highest honours, and soon supplied with a suitable armament for the prosecution of his discoveries. In his second voyage he discovered the Caribbees and Jamaica. In a third voyage, 1498, he descried the continent of America, within ten degrees of the line, towards the isth mus of Panama. To this continent the geo grapher Americus, \\_Amerigo Vespucci,] who, five years after, followed the footsteps of Co- s 2"], [278, "260 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. lumbus, had the undeserved honour of giving his name. 2. The inhabitants of America and its islands were a race of men quite new to the Europeans. They are of the colour of copper, and have no beard. In some quarters, as in Mexico and Peru, the Spaniards found a flourishing empire, and a people polished, refined, and luxurious. In others, man was a naked savage, the member of a wandering tribe, whose sole occupation was hunting or war. The savages of the continent were characterised alike by their cruelty to their enemies, their contempt of death, and their generous affection for their friends. The inha bitants of the islands were a milder race, of gentler manners, and less hardy conformation of body and mind. The larger animals, as the [elephant, the camel, the] horse, and the cow, were unknown in America; [and the natural productions were, comparatively, either with Europe or India, few: there were no lemons, oranges, pomegranates, quinces, figs, olives, me lons, vines, nor sugar-canes : neither apples, pears, plums, cherries, currants, gooseberries, rice, nor any other corn but maize ; no poultry, except turkeys, no cats or dogs.] 3. To the inhabitants of those new discovered"], [279, "SECT. 41. MODERN HISTORY. 261 countries, which were believed to contain inex haustible treasures, the Spaniards, under the pretence of religion and policy, conducted themselves with the most shocking inhumanity. The rack, the scourge, the faggot, were em ployed to convert them to Christianity. They were hunted down like wild beasts, or burnt alive in their thickets and fastnesses. Hispa niola, containing three millions of inhabitants, and Cuba, containing above six hundred thou sand, were, in a few years, absolutely depopu lated. [How extraordinary must it have ap peared to those at all capable of reflecting on the fate of Galileo, who had suffered for merely suggesting that there might be antipodes, to think that now they were discovered, a successor of the Roman Pontiff, who punished so severely his supposed ignorance and presumption, should eagerly seize upon them as his own, and bestow them upon whom he chose, by measurement, and a formal assignment of boundaries, which, however, was actually the case.] It was now resolved to explore the continent ; and Ferdi nando Cortez, with eleven ships and 617 men, sailed for that purpose from Cuba in 1519. Landing at Tabasco, he advanced, though with a brave opposition from the natives, into the s 3"], [280, "262 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. heart of the country. The state of Tlascala, after ineffectual resistance, became the ally of the Spaniards ; and, on their approach to Mexico, the terror of their name, [heightened by the ap pearance of the horses, and the noise of the ar tillery,] had paved the way for an easy conquest. 4. The Mexican empire, though founded little more than a century before this period, had arisen to great splendour. [The capital, situated in the middle of an extensive lake, ex hibited a degree of magnificence little to be ex pected in regions so wild and so remote from the more civilised parts of the globe.] Its sove reign, Montezuma, received the invaders with the reverence due to superior beings. But a short acquaintance opened the eyes of the Mexicans ; and finding nothing in the Spaniards beyond what was human, they were daring enough to attack, and put to death a few of them. The intrepid Cortez immediately marched to the palace with fifty men, and putting the Emperor in irons, car ried him off' prisoner to his camp. The astonished Mexicans submitted to every term, and agreed to redeem their sovereign by the surrender of all the imperial treasures. [Cortez divided the spoils into five parts ; one of which he assigned to his own sovereign, one he took to himself) and distributed the remainder amongst his soldiers.]"], [281, "SECT. 41. 263 MODERN HISTORY. 5. Velasquez, governor of Cuba, jealous of Cortez, attempted to supersede him, by dis- patching a superior army to the continent ; but the latter defeating his troops, compelled them to join his own banners. In an attack from the Mexicans for the rescue of their sovereign, Mon- tezuma having offered to mediate between the Mexicans and their enemies, was indignantly put to death by one of his own subjects. The whole empire, under its new sovereign, Guati- mozin, [a near relative of Montezuma,] was now armed against the Spaniards ; and while the plains were covered with their archers and spearmen, the lake of Mexico was filled with armed canoes. To oppose the latter, the Spaniards built a few vessels under the walls of their city, and soon evinced their superiority on both elements to their feeble foe. The monarch was taken prisoner by the officers of Cortez, and refusing to discover his treasures, was stretched naked on burning coals. Soon after, on the discovery of a conspiracy against the Spaniards, the wretched Guatimozin, with all the princes of his blood, were executed on a gibbet. This was the last blow to the power of the Mexicans, and Cortez was now absolute master of the whole empire, 1527. [The very extraordinary s 4"], [282, "264 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. manner in which this conquest was achieved, by comparatively such a handful of Europeans, opposed not only to hundreds of thousands of infuriated savages, but to a rival party of their own countrymen, must, notwithstanding the cruelties committed, and the injustice of the whole proceeding, impress us with strong ideas of the valour and resolution of the commander, who was, after all, suffered to die, in his native country, under circumstances of neglect scarcely to be credited.] 6. In the same year [that Cortez finally subdued the Mexicans,] 1527, Diego D'Alma gro and Francis Pizarro, with 250 foot, 60 horse, and 12 small pieces of cannon, landed in Peru, a large and flourishing empire, governed by an ancient race of monarchs named Incas- The Inca Atabalipa, [at the head of an army of forty thousand men, armed with pikes and ar rows of gold and silver,] receiving the Spaniards with reverence, they immediately required him to embrace the Christian faith, and surrender all his dominions to the Emperor Charles V., Who had obtained a gift of them from the Pope. The proposal being misunderstood, or received with hesitation, Pizarro seized the monarch as his prisoner, while his troops massacred 5000 of the Peruvians on the spot, [the cannon, horses,"], [283, "SECT. 41. 265 MODERN HISTORY. and novel appearance of the Spanish soldiers having produced the same degree of fascination as had occurred on the first attack of the Mexi cans.] The empire was now plundered of pro digious treasures in gold and precious stones; but Atabalipa, being suspected of concealing a part from his insatiable invaders, was solemnly tried as a criminal, and strangled at a stake. 7- The courage of the Spaniards surpassed even their inhumanity. D'Almagro marched 500 leagues, through continual opposition, to Cusco, and penetrated across the Cordilleras into Chili, two degrees beyond the southern tropic. He was slain in a civil war between him and his associate, Francis Pizarro, who was soon after assassinated by the party of his rival. At this time the Spaniards discovered the inex haustible silver mines of Potosi, which they compelled the Peruvians, [to whom these trea sures were previously unknown,] to work for their advantage. They are now wrought by the negroes of Africa. The native Peruvians, who are a weakly race of men, were soon almost exterminated by cruelty and intolerable labour. The humane Bishop of Chiapa, [whose me moirs of these times and transactions cannot be read without horror,] remonstrated with suc cess to Charles V. on this subject, [and to his"], [284, "266 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. successor Philip II.,] and the residue of this mi serable people, [though the worthy bishop was a good deal opposed in his attempts to ameliorate matters,] have been since treated with more in dulgence. 8. The Spanish acquisitions in America be long to the crown and not to the state : they are the absolute property of the sovereign, and regulated solely by his will. They are governed by the three Viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and Terra Firm a, who exercise supreme civil and military authority over their provinces. There are eleven courts of audience for the adminis tration of justice, with whose judicial proceed ings the Viceroys cannot interfere ; and their judgments are subject to appeal to the Royal Council of the Indies, whose jurisdiction ex tends to every department, ecclesiastical, civil, military, and commercial. A tribunal in Spain, called Casa de la Contratacion, regulates the de parture of the fleets, and their destination and equipment, under the control of the Council of the Indies. * * No alteration is attempted in this passage, because it properly represents the state of things, previously to the late attempts to establish the independence of the Spanish colonies ; a struggle which can scarcely be said to be so fully terminated, even yet, as to allow us to speak of it with his torical precision."], [285, "SECT. 41. 267 MODERN HISTORY. 9. The gold and silver of Spanish America, though the exclusive property of the crown of Spain, has, by means of wars, marriages of princes, and extension of commerce, come into general circulation, and has greatly increased the quantity of specie, and diminished the value of money over all Europe. [But the earliest effects of the gold and silver found in America were to give animation to the East Indian trade laid open to the world, by the concurrent dis coveries of the Portuguese. The latter found in the East, commercially speaking, all things ready for them, and needed therefore only an ability to purchase what was wanted, and to draw an old established trade into a new chan nel. The Spaniards, on the contrary, found the natives of America rude and ignorant, wholly unacquainted with the principles of commerce, and the country abounding certainly with trea sures, but which required much labour and atten tion before they could expect to derive any great advantages from them. In time, besides gold and silver, the native productions of Ame rica, cochineal, tobacco, indigo, bark, cotton, ginger, cocoa, and various drugs, rendered the western as profitable as the eastern discoveries.]"], [286, "268 PART II MODERN HISTORY. XLIL POSSESSIONS OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS IN AMERICA. 1. The example of the Spaniards excited a desire in the other nations of Europe to partici pate with them in the riches of the New World. The French, in 1557, attempted to form a set tlement on the coast of Brazil, where the Por tuguese had already established themselves from the beginning of the century. The colony was divided by faction, and was soon utterly de stroyed by the Portuguese. It is one of the richest of the American settlements, both from the produce of its soil, and its mines of gold and precious stones. 2. The Spaniards were in possession of Flo rida, when the French attempted to colonise it in 1564, but without success. The French then established a settlement in Canada, and founded Quebec in 1608 ; but the colony was perpetually subject to attack from the English. In 1629 the French had not a foot of territory in Ame-"], [287, "SECT. 42. MODERN HISTORY. 269 rica. Canada has been repeatedly taken by the English and restored, by different treaties, to the French ; but it has now for many years been permanently a British settlement. The French drew their greatest advantages from the islands of St. Domingo, Guadaloupe, and Martinico. From their continental possessions of Louisiana, and the settlements on the Mississippi, which they have now lost, they never derived any solid benefit. 3. The Dutch have no other settlement on the continent of America but Surinam, a part of Guiana ; and, in the West Indies, the islands of Curassoa and St. Eustatius. The Danes possess the inconsiderable islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz. 4. The British have extensive settlements on the continent of America, and the West India islands. England derived her right to her set tlements in North America from the first dis covery of the country by Sebastian Cabot, [a Venetian merchant, patronised by Henry VII., who appears to have begun his voyage from England, 1497,] five years after the discovery of South America by Columbus; but there were no attempts to colonise any part of the country till about a century afterwards, when"], [288, "270 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Sir Walter Raleigh, [in 1584,] planted the colony of Virginia, so named in honour of his Queen. Nova Scotia was planted under James I., and New England in the reign of Charles I., chiefly by the refugee Puritans. New York and Penn sylvania were in the hands of the Dutch, till conquered by the English in the reign of Charles II., who granted a gift of the latter province, with a charter of privileges, to William Penn the Quaker. Maryland was colonised in the time of Charles I. by English Catholics. The Carolinas were settled in the reign of Charles II. Georgia was not colonised till the reign of George II. The Floridas were ceded to Britain by Spain at the peace of 1763. 5. The British American colonies, under which name we include the United States, are greatly inferior in natural riches to those of the Spa niards, as they produce neither silver nor gold, indigo nor cochineal ; but they are in general of fertile soil, and highly improved by industry ; and they afford a most profitable market for home manufactures. * The produce of the West India islands, Jamaica, Barbadoes, St. [* For a farther account of the United States, see Vol. III.

OF THE STATE OF THE FINE ARTS IN EUROPE IN THE AGE OF LEO X. 1. In enumerating those great objects which characterised the end of the fifteenth and be ginning of the sixteenth century, we remarked the high advancement to which the fine arts attained in Europe in the age of Leo X. The strong bent which the human mind seems to take in certain periods to one class of pursuits in preference to all others, as in that age to the fine arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture, may be in part accounted for from moral causes ; such as the peaceful state of a country, the ge nius or taste of its sovereigns, and their liberal encouragement of those arts ; the general emu lation that arises where one or two artists are of confessed eminence; and the aid which they derive from the studies and works of each other. These causes have doubtless great influence,"], [290, "272 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. but do not seem entirely sufficient to account for the phenomenon. The operation of such causes must be slow and gradual. In the case of the fine arts, the transition from obscurity to splendour was rapid and instantaneous. From the contemptible mediocrity in which they had remained for ages, they rose at one step to the highest pitch of excellence. 2. The arts of painting and sculpture were buried in the West under the ruins of the Roman empire. They gradually declined in the latter ages, as we may perceive by the series of the coins of the Lower Empire. The Ostro- goths, instead of destroying, sought to preserve the monuments of taste and genius. They were even the inventors of some of the arts dependent on design, as the composition of Mosaic. But, in the middle ages, those arts were at a very low ebb in Europe. They began, however, to revive a little about the end of the thirteenth century. Cimabue, a Florentine, from the sight of the paintings of some Greek artists in one of the churches, began to attempt similar performances, and soon excelled his models. His scholars were Ghiotto, Gaddi, Tasi, Cavallini, and Stephano Fiorentino; and these formed an academy at Florence in 1350."], [291, "SE CT. 43. MODERN HISTORY. 273 3. The works of these early painters, with some fidelity of imitation, had not a spark of grace or elegance ; and such continued to be the state of the art till towards the end of the fifteenth century, when it arose at once to the summit of perfection. Raphael painted at first in the hard manner of his master Perugino ; but soon deserted it, and struck at once into the noble, elegant, and graceful ; in short, the imi tation of the antique. This change was the result of genius alone. The ancient sculptures were familiar to the early painters, but they had looked on them with cold indi; erence. They were now surveyed by other eyes. Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci, were animated by the same genius that formed the Grecian Apelles, Zeuxis, Glycon, Phidias, and Praxiteles. 4. Nor was Italy alone thus distinguished. Germany, Flanders, and Switzerland, produced in the same age artists of consummate merit. Before the notice of these, we shall briefly cha racterise the schools of Italy. 5. First in order is the school of Florence, of which the most eminent master was Michael Angelo, born in 1474. His works are charac terised by a profound knowledge of the anatomy vol. 11. t"], [292, "274 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. of the human figure, perhaps chiefly formed on the contemplation of the ancient sculptures. His paintings exhibit the grand, the sublime, and terrible ; but he drew not from the antique its simple grace and beauty. 6. The Roman school was founded by Ra phael d'Urbino, born 1483. This great painter united almost every excellence of the art. In invention, grace, majestic simplicity, forcible ex pression of the passions, he stands unrivalled, and far beyond all competition. He has bor rowed liberally, but without servility, from the antique. 7. Of the school of Lombardy, or the Ve netian, the most eminent artists were, Titian, Giorgione, Corregio, and Parmeggiano. Titian is most eminent in portrait, and in the painting of female beauty. Such is the truth of his colour ing, that his figures are nature itself. It was the testimony of Michael Angelo to the merits of Titian, that, if he had studied at Rome or Florence, amidst the master-pieces of antiquity, he would have eclipsed all the painters in the world. Giorgione, with similar merits, was cut off in the flower of his youth. Titian lived to the age of a hundred. Corregio was superior in colouring, and knowledge of light and shade,"], [293, "SECT. 43. 275 MODERN HISTORY. to all that have preceded or followed him. This knowledge was the result of study : in other painters those effects are frequently accidental, as we observe they are not uniform. Parmeg giano imitated the graceful manner of Raphael, but carried it to a degree of affectation. 8. Such wTere the three original Italian schools. The character of the Florentine is grandeur and sublimity, with great excellence of design, but a want of grace, of skill in colouring, and effect of light and shade. The character of the Ro man is equal excellence of design, a grandeur tempered with moderation and simplicity, a high degree of grace and elegance, and a superior knowledge, though not an excellence, in co louring. The character of the Venetian is the perfection of colouring, and the utmost force of light and shade, with an inferiority in every other particular. 9. To the school of Raphael succeeded the second Roman school, or that of the Caraccis, three brothers, of whom Annibal was the most excellent. His scholars were, Guercino, Al bano, Lanfranc, Domenichino, and Guido. Of these, though all eminent painters, the first and last were the most excellent. The ele gant contours of Guercino, and the strength, t 2"], [294, "276 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. sweetness, and majesty of Guido, are the admir ation of all true judges of painting. 10. In the same age, the Flemish school, though of a quite different character, and inferior to the Italian, shone with great lustre. Oil painting was invented by the Flemings in the fifteenth century ; and, in that age, Heemskirk, Frans Floris, Quintin Matsys, and the German Albert Durer, were deservedly distinguished. Of the Flemish school Rubens, though a painter of a much later age, is the chief ornament. His figures, though too corpulent, are drawn with great truth and nature, and he possesses inex haustible invention, and great skill in the ex pression of the passions. Switzerland produced Hans Holbein, a painter of great eminence in portrait, and remarkable for truth of colouring. Of his works, from his residence at the court of Henry VIIL, there are more specimens in Britain than those of any other foreign painter. \u2014 Holland had likewise its painters, whose chief merit was the faithful representation of vulgar nature, and perfect knowledge of the mechanism of the art, the power of colours, and the effect of light and shade. 11. With the art of painting, sculpture and architecture were likewise revived in the same"], [295, "SECT. 4S. 277 MODERN HISTORY. age, and brought to high perfection. The uni versal genius of Michael Angelo shone equally conspicuous in all the three departments. His statue of Bacchus was judged by Raphael to be the work of Phidias or Praxiteles. \u2014 The Gre cian architecture was first revived by the Flo rentines in the fourteenth century ; and the cathedral of Pisa was constructed partly from the materials of an ancient Greek temple. The art arrived at high perfection in the age of Leo X., when the church of St. Peter's at Rome, under the direction of Bramante, San Gallo, Raphael, and Michael Angelo, exhibited the noblest specimen of architecture in the uni verse. 12. The invention of the art of engraving on copper by Tomaso Finiguerra, a goldsmith of Florence, is dated about 1460. From Italy it travelled into Flanders, where it was first prac tised by Martin Schoen of Antwerp. His scholar was the celebrated Albert Durer, who engraved with excellence both on copper and on wood. Etching on copper by means of aquafortis, which gives more ease than the stroke of the graver, was discovered by Parmeggiano, who executed in that manner his own beautiful designs. No art underwent, in its early stages, T 3"], [296, "278 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. so rapid an improvement as that of engraving. In the course of 150 years from its invention, it attained nearly to its perfection ; for there has been but little proportional improvement in the last century, since the days of Audran, Poilly, and Edelinck. 13. The art of engraving in mezzotinto is of much later date than the ordinary mode of engraving on copper. It was the invention of Prince Rupert about 1650. It is characterised by a softness equal to that of the pencil, and a happy blending of light and shade, and is therefore pe culiarly adapted to portrait, where those re quisites are most essential. 14. The age of Leo X. was likewise an era of very high literary splendour ; but of the dis tinguished writers of that period we shall after wards treat, in a connected view of the pro gress of literature and the sciences during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."], [297, "SECT. 41. MODERN HISTORY. 279 XLIV. OF THE OTTOMAN POWER IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 1. From the period of the taking of Con- stantinople, in the middle of the fifteenth cen- tury, the Turks were a great and conquering people. In the [beginning of the] sixteenth century, Selim I., after subduing Syria and Me- sopotamia, undertook the conquest of Egypt, then governed by the Mamalukes,a race of Cir- cassians, who had seized the country in 1250, and put an end to the government of the Arabian princes, the posterity of Saladin. The conquest of Egypt by Selim made little change in the foi-m of its government. It professes to own the sovereignty of the Turks, but is in reality governed still by the Mamaluke Beys. 2. Solyman (the Magnificent), son of Selim, was, like his predecessors, a great conqueror. The island of Rhodes, possessed by the Knights of St. John, was a darling object of his ambition. These knights had expelled the Saracens from t 4"], [298, "280 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. the island in 1310. Solyman attacked Rhodes with 140,000 men and 400 ships. The Rhodian knights, aided by the English, Italians, and Spaniards, made a noble defence ; but, after a siege of many months, were forced to capitulate, and evacuate the island, 1522, which has been the property of the Turks ever since. The commercial laws of the ancient Rhodians were adopted by the Romans, and are at this day the foundation of the maritime jurisprudence of all the nations of Europe. 3. Solyman subdued the greatest part of Hungary, Moldavia, and Walachia, and took from the Persians Georgia and Bagdat. [He died while besieging a town in Hungary, having extended his authority over a track of country, reaching from Algiers to the Euphrates, and from the further end of the Black Sea to the extremity of Greece and Epirus.] His son, Selim II., took Cyprus from the Venetians in 1571. They applied to Pope [Pius V.] for aid, who, together with Philip II. of Spain, [after having tried in vain to rouse other European potentates to engage in the enterprise,] entered into a triple alliance against the Ottoman power. An armament of 250 ships of war, commanded by Philip's natural brother, Don John of Aus-"], [299, "SECT. 44. 281 MODERN HISTORY. tria, [having under him, on the part of the Romans, Mark Anthony Colonna, Admiral of the Pope's gallies, and on the part of the Vene tians, Sebastian Venieso, of a distinguished family,] was opposed to 250 Turkish gallies in the gulf of Lepanto, near Corinth. [Never since the battle of Actium had the Grecian seas beheld so numerous a fleet. After a des perate engagement,] the Turks were defeated, with the loss of 150 ships and 15,000 men, 1571. This great victory was soon after followed by the taking of Tunis by the same commander ; [but the Turks were not long before they reco vered it.] 4. These successes, therefore, were of little consequence. The Ottoman power continued extremely formidable. Under Amurath II. the Turks made encroachments on Hungary, and subdued a part of Persia. Mahomet III., though a barbarian in his private character, supported the dignity of the empire, and extended its do minions. The Ottoman power declined from this time, and yielded to that of the Persians under Schah-Abbas the Great, who wrested from the Turks a large part of their late acquired dominions."], [300, "282 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. XLV. STATE OF PERSIA AND THE OTHER ASIATIC KINGDOMS IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVEN- TEENTH CENTURIES. 1. The great empire of Persia, in the end of the fifteenth century, underwent a revolution on account of religion. Haydar or Sophi, a religious enthusiast, established a new sect of Mahometans, which held Ali to be the successor of Mahomet instead of Omar, and abolished the pilgrimages to Mecca. The Persians eagerly embraced a doctrine which distinguished them from their enemies the Turks ; and Ismael the son of Sophi, following the example of Maho met, enforced his opinions by the sword. He subdued all Persia and Armenia, and lest his vast empire to his descendants. 2. Schah-Abbas, surnamed the Great, was the great-grandson of Ismael Sophi. He ruled his empire with despotic sway, but with most able policy, [for the long space of nearly fifty years.] He regained the provinces which had"], [301, "SECT. 45. MODERN HISTORY. 283 been taken by the Turks, and drove the Portu guese from their settlement of Ormuz. He rebuilt the fallen cities of Persia, and contributed greatly to the introduction of arts and civilisation. His son Schah-Sesi reigned weakly and unfor tunately. In his time, Schah-Gean, the Great Mogul, deprived Persia of Candahar, and the Turks took Bagdat in 1638. From that period the Persian monarchy gradually declined. Its sovereigns became the most despicable slaves to their own ministers ; and a revolution in the be ginning of the eighteenth century put an end to the dynasty of the Sophis, and gave the throne to the Afghan princes, a race of Tartars. 3. The government of Persia is almost as despotic as that of Turkey. The sovereign draws a small yearly tax from every subject, and receives likewise stated gifts on particular occasions. The crown is hereditary, with the exclusion of females ; but the sons of a daughter succeed in their room. There is no other rank in Persia than that annexed to office, which is held during the monarch's pleasure. The national religion is the Mahometan, as reformed by Sophi, [but other forms of religion and modes of wor ship are tolerated.] The sect of the Guebres preserve the religion of Zoroaster, as contained"], [302, "284 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. in the Zendavesta and Sadder, (see supra, Part I. Sect XL) and keep alive the sacred fire. 4. The poetry of the Persians displays great fancy and luxuriance of imagery. The epic poet Firdousi is said to rival the various merits of Homer and Ariosto ; and the writings of Sadi and Hafez, both in prose and poetry, are admired by all who are conversant in oriental literature. [The Persians are, in general, much given to astrology. Sir John Chardin reports that, in his time, even the government expended upon astrologers immense sums.] 5. Tartary. \u2014 From this vast tract of country sprang those conquerors who produced all the great revolutions in Asia. The Turks, a race of Tartars, overwhelmed the empire of the Caliphs. Mahmoud, a Tartar, conquered Persia and great part of India in the tenth century. The Tartar Gengiscan subdued India, China, Persia, and Asiatic Russia, in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Batoucan, one of his sons, ravaged to the frontiers of Germany. Ta merlane, the scourge of the Turks, and con queror of a great part of Asia, was of the race of Gengiscan. Babar, great-grandson of Tamer lane, subdued all between Samarcand and Agra in the empire of the Mogul. The descendants"], [303, "SECT. 46. MODERN HISTORY. 285 of those conquerors reign in India, Persia, and China, [and have assimilated themselves to the habits and manners of the countries subdued by their arms ;] but Tartary itself is still no more than a vast desert, inhabited by wandering tribes, who follow the life of the ancient Scythians. 6. Thibet. \u2014 This southern part of Tartary exhibits the phenomenon of a kingdom governed by a living god, the Dalai Lama, or Great Lama, whose divinity is acknowledged not only by his own subjects but over China and a part of India. This god is a young man whom the priests educate and train to his function, and in whose name they in reality govern the kingdom. XLVI. HISTORY OF INDIA. 1. The earliest accounts of this great tract of civilised country are those of Herodotus, who lived about a century before Alexander the Great ; and it is remarkable that the character given of the people by that early writer cor responds perfectly with that of the modern"], [304, "286 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Hindoos. He had probably taken his accounts from Scylax of Cariandria, whom Darius Hys taspes had sent to explore the country. But it was not till the age of Alexander that the Greeks had any particular knowledge of that extraordinary people. Alexander penetrated into the Panjab, where his troops refusing to proceed, he embarked on the Hydaspes, which runs into the Indus, and thence pursued his course for above 1000 miles to the ocean. The narrative given by Arrian of this expedition was taken from the mouths of Alexander's officers ; and its particulars tally yet more remarkably than those of Herodotus with the modern man ners of the Hindoos. 2. India was visited by Seleucus, to whose share it fell in the partition of Alexander's em pire ; and Antiochus the Great, 200 years afterwards, made a short expedition thither. It is probable, too, that some small intercourse subsisted between the Greek empire of Bactriana and India; but till the fifteenth century, no European power thought of forming any esta blishment in that country ; though, from the age of Alexander down to the period of the Portuguese discoveries, there had constantly been some commercial intercourse between Eu-"], [305, "SECT. 46. MODERN HISTORY. 287 rope and India, both by sea and across the desert. 3. The Mahometans, as early as A. D. 1000, had begun to establish an empire in India. Mahmoud, a Tartar, conquered a great part of the country, and established his capital at Ghazna, near the sources of the Indus, extir pating, wherever he came, the Hindoo religion, and establishing the Mahometan in its stead. Mo hammed Gori, in 1194*, penetrated to Benares, [the principal seat, school, or university of braminical learning,] and one of his successors fixed the seat of his empire at Delhy, which has continued to be the capital of the Mogul princes. The sovereignty founded by Mahmoud was overwhelmed in 1222 by Gengiscan, [who did not, however, extend his conquests far into the peninsula.] Gengiscan's empire in the following century [was overthrown] by Tamerlane, [who first turned his arms against Hindostan in 1398, and] whose posterity are at this day on the throne of the Mogul empire. 4. The Mogul empire was, even in the begin ning of the 18th century, the most powerful and flourishing of all the Asiatic monarchies, under * [1184, Rennel.]"], [306, "288 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Aurengzebe, the son of Schah-Gean, who, though a monster of cruelty, and most despotic tyrant, enjoyed a life prolonged to nearly an hundred years, crowned with uninterrupted pros perity and success. [He died in the year 1707, in the 90th year of his age, having established an empire reaching from the tenth to the thirty fifth degree of latitude, and nearly as much in longitude ; but so weighty a sceptre, like the sceptre of Charlemagne, required the hand of Aurengzebe to wield it : from the moment of his death things fell into confusion ; and in the course of fifty years a succession of weak and wicked princes reduced this mighty empire to nothing.] 5. The dominion of the Mogul was not ab solute over all the countries which composed his empire. Tamerlane allowed the petty princes, rajahs or nabobs, to retain their territories, of which their descendants are at this day in pos session. They paid a tribute to the Great Mogul, as an acknowledgment of his sove reignty, and observed the treaties agreed to by their ancestors ; but they were in other respects independent princes, [and by no means indis posed to revolt upon any tempting or favourable opportunity.]"], [307, "SECT. 46. MODERN HISTORY. 289 6. Bengal became a part of the Mogul's empire by conquest in the end of the sixteenth century, and was commonly governed by a son of the Great Mogul, who had under him several in ferior Nabobs, the former princes of the country. Such was its condition when the British East India Company, [who in the year 1716 first obtained the famous firman or grant by which their goods of export and import were exempted from duties, or customs, and which is regarded as their great Commercial Charter,] between 1751 and I76O, conquered and obtained posses sion of that kingdom, together with Bahar and part of Orissa, a large, populous, and most flourishing country, containing above ten mil lions of inhabitants, and producing an immense revenue ; and these territories have since that period received a considerable addition. The East India Company thence has the benefit of the whole commerce of the Mogul empire, with Arabia, Persia, and Thibet, as well as with the kingdoms of Azem, Aracan, Pegu, Siam, Malacca, China, and many of the oriental islands. The fixed establishments of the British in the country of Indostan have afforded opportunity of obtaining much instructive knowledge relative vol. 11. u"], [308, "290 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. to the ancient state of that country, of which we shall give a short sketch in the following section. XLVII. ANCIENT STATE OF INDIA ; MANNERS, LAWS, ARTS AND SCIENCES, AND RELIGION OF THE HINDOOS. 1. The remains of the ancient knowledge of the Hindoos have been preserved by a hereditary priesthood, in the Sanscreet language, long since extinct, and only known to a few of the Bramins. The zeal of some learned Europeans has lately opened that source of information, whence we learn the most interesting particulars of this extraordinary people, perhaps the most early cultivators of the sciences, and the instructors of all the nations of antiquity. We shall briefly notice their singular division into casts, their civil policy, their laws, their progress in the arts and sciences, and their religion. 2. The whole body of the people was divided into four orders or casts. The highest, that of the Bramins, was devoted to religion and the cultivation of the sciences : to the second be longed the preservation of the state ; they were"], [309, "SECT. 47. MODERN HISTORY. 291 its sovereigns and its magistrates in peace, and its soldiers in war : the third were the husband men and merchants ; and the fourth the artisans, labourers, and servants. These are inseparable distinctions, and descend from generation to generation. Moreover, the individuals of each class follow invariably the professions of then forefathers. Every man, from his birth, knows the function allotted to him, and fulfils with ease and satisfaction the duty which he cannot avoid. Hence arises that permanence of manners and institutions which so singularly characterises this ancient nation. 3. This classification is an artificial arrange ment, which could have originated only from the mind of a legislator among a polished people, completely obedient to government. It is there fore a proof of the highly civilised state of the Hindoo nation in the most remote periods of antiquity. 4. The civil policy of the Hindoos is another proof of the same fact. At the time of Alex ander the Great, India was divided into large and powerful kingdoms, governed by sovereigns whose dominion was not absolute, but controlled by the superior authority of the Bramins. A system of feudalism has ever prevailed in India; u 2"], [310, "292 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. the rights to lands flow from the sovereign, to whom a certain duty is payable by the class of the husbandmen, who transmit their possessions to their children under the same tenure. Strabo and Diodorus remarked among the Indians three classes of officers ; one whose department was the regulation of agriculture, tanks, highways ; another which superintended the police of the cities ; a third which regulated the military department. The same policy prevails at this day under the Hindoo princes. 5. The jurisprudence of Hindostan is an additional proof of great antiquity and civil isation. The Ayen-Akbery, and still more the compilation of Hindoo laws from the an cient Sanscreet records, made by order of Mr. Hastings, contain the jurisprudence of a refined and commercial people, among whom law itself had been a study and profession. 6. Many monuments exist in India of the advanced state of the useful and elegant arts in the remotest periods of antiquity. The an cient pagodas, of vast extent and magnificence, whether cut in the solid rock, as in Elephanta and Salsette, or in the open air, as at Chillam brum and Seringham, the sumptuous residences of the Bramins ; and the ancient hill fortresses,"], [311, "SECT. 47'. MODERN HISTORY. 293 constructed with prodigious strength and solidity, evince a great advancement in the arts : as the resort of the most polished nations of antiquity to that country for cotton cloths, fine linen, and works in metal and in ivory, proves the superior state of those manufactures to all known at that time in Europe. 7. The late translations from the Sanscreet of several ingenious compositions of high an tiquity, as the dramatic piece Sacontala, the Hitbpadesa, a series of moral apologues and fables, the Mahabaret, an epic poem, composed above 2000 years before the Christian \u00e6ra, all concur in proof of a similar advancement in literature ; and we have reason to believe, from such works as are of a philosophical nature, that there is scarce a tenet of the Greek philosophy that has not been antecedently the subject of discussion among the Bramins of India. 8. The numeral cyphers, first introduced into Europe by the Arabians, were, as confessed by those authors themselves, borrowed from the Indians. It is above a century since the French philosophers evinced, by the evidence of a Siamese manuscript, containing tables for cal culating the places of the heavenly bodies, the astonishing advancement made by this ancient u 3"], [312, "294 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. people in the science of astronomy. A set of tables obtained lately from the Bramins by M. Gentil, goes back to an \u00e6ra termed Calyoug ham, commencing 3102 years before the birth of Christ. These tables are used by the modern Bramins, who are quite ignorant of the princi ples on which they have been constructed, and which M. Bailly has shown to be the same em ployed by the moderns, but with which the Greeks and Chaldeans were utterly unac quainted. 9. Lastly, From the religious opinions and worship of the Hindoos we must draw the same conclusion as from all the preceding facts. One uniform system of superstition pervades every religion of India, which is supported by the most sagacious policy, and every thing that can excite the veneration of its votaries. The Bramins, elevated above every other class of men, and exclusively acquainted with the mys teries of that religion, which it is held impious for any other class to attempt to penetrate ; the implicit reliance on the authority of these Bramins ; the ceremonies of their worship, fitted to impress the imagination, and affect the pas sions ; all concurred to fortify this potent su perstition, and to give its priests a supreme"], [313, "SECT. 48. MODERN HISTORY. 295 ascendancy over the minds of the people. But those priests themselves, enlightened as they were, rejected that false theology. Their writ ings demonstrate that they entertained the most rational and elevated conceptions with regard to the Supreme Being, and the support of the universe. 10. On the whole, there is a high probability that India was the great school from which the most early polished nations of Europe derived their knowledge of the arts, of sciences, and of literature. XLVIII. OF CHINA AND JAPAN. 1. Proceeding eastward in the survey of the Asiatic continent, the great empire of China next solicits our attention. In the end of the tenth century, China, Persia, and the greatest part of India, were ruled by the Tartar descend ants of Gengiskan. The Tartar family of Yven, who conquered China, made no change in its laws and system of government, which had been permanent from time immemorial. Of this u 4"], [314, "296 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. family there reigned nine successive monarchs, without any attempt by the Chinese to throw off' the Tartar yoke. The odious and contemptible character of the last of these sovereigns at length excited a rebellion, which, in 1357, drove the Tartars from the throne ; and the Chinese, for 276 years, obeyed their native princes. At that period a second revolution gave the throne once more to the Tartars. Taking advantage of an insurrection in one of the provinces, they in vaded China in 1641, and made an easy con quest. The Emperor shut himself up in his palace, and, after putting to death aM his family, finished the scene by hanging himself The same Tartars occupy the throne of China at this day, and observe the same wise policy of main taining inviolate the Chinese laws, policy, and manners. Of these we shall give a brief ac count in the subsequent section. 2. The empire of Japan was discovered by the Portuguese about the middle of the sixteenth century. The open and unsuspicious character of this industrious and polished people led them to encourage the resort of foreigners to their ports ; and the Spaniards, after they had ob tained the sovereignty of Portugal, carried on a most beneficial trade to the coast of Japan."], [315, "SECT. 48. 297 MODERN HISTORY. [The commodities procured from thence con sisting in the finest sort of tea, gold, silver, and copper, the most beautiful porcelain, ambergris, &c] The Emperor zealously promoted this intercourse, till the insatiable ambition of the Spaniards gave him alarming conviction of its danger. Under the pretence of converting the Japanese from idolatry, a vast number of priests were sent into the country, and one half of the people were speedily set at mortal variance with the other. It now became necessary to prohibit this work of conversion by an imperial edict. Still, however, a free trade was allowed, till 1637, when a conspiracy of the Spaniards was discovered for dethroning the Emperor and seizing the government. An edict was issued for the expulsion of all the Spaniards and Por tuguese, who were mad enough to resist, till overpowered by force of arms. Since that period all the European nations have been ex cluded from the ports of Japan. The Dutch only, who had been the discoverers of the con spiracy of the Spaniards, are allowed the pri vilege of landing on one of the small islands, for the purposes of trade, aster making oath that they are not of the Portuguese religion."], [316, "298 MODERN HISTORY. PART II XLIX. OF THE ANTIQUITY OF THE EMPIRE OF CHINA. STATE OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES, MANNERS, GOVERNMENT, LAWS. 1. The antiquity of this vast empire, and the state of its government, laws, manners, and attainments in the arts and sciences, have fur- nished a most ample field of controversy. Vol- taire, Raynal, and other writers of similar principles, have, for the purpose of discrediting the scriptural account of the origin of mankind, and the received notions of the age of the universe, given to the Chinese empire an im- mense antiquity, and a character of such high civilisation and knowledge of the sciences and arts at that remote period, as to be utterly irreconcileable with the state and progress of man as described in the books of Moses. On the other hand, it is probable that the desire of invalidating those opinions has induced other writers of ability to go to an opposite extreme ; to undervalue this singular people, and to give too little weight to any accounts which we have,"], [317, "SECT. 49. MODERN HISTORY. 299 either of the duration of their empire, the economy of their government and police, or of their attainments in the arts and sciences. Amidst this contrariety of sentiments, we shall endeavour to form such opinion as appears most consonant to the truth. 2. The panegyrists of the Chinese assert that their empire has subsisted above 4000 years, without any material alteration in its laws, man ners, language, or even fashion of dress ; in evi dence of which they appeal to a series of eclipses, marking contemporary events, all accurately calculated, for 2155 years before the birth of Christ. As it is easy to calculate eclipses back wards from the present day to any given period of time, it is thus possible to give to a history, fictitious from beginning to end, its chronology of real eclipses. This proof, therefore, amounts to nothing, unless it were likewise proved that all those eclipses were actually recorded at the time when they happened ; but this neither has been nor can be done ; for it is an allowed fact that there are no regular historical records be yond the third century before the Christian \u00e6ra. The present Chinese are utterly ignorant of the motions of the celestial bodies, and cannot cal-"], [318, "300 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. culate eclipses. The series mentioned has there fore in all probability been calculated by some of the Jesuits, to ingratiate themselves with the Emperors, and flatter the national vanity. The Jesuits have presided in the tribunal of mathe matics for above 200 years. 3. But if the authentic annals of this empire go back even to the third century before Christ, and record at that time a high state of civilisa tion, we must allow that the Chinese are an an cient and early polished people, and that they have possessed a singular constancy in their go vernment, laws, and manners. Sir William Jones, no bigotted encomiast of this people, allows their great antiquity and early civilisation, and, with much apparent probability, traces their origin from the Hindoos. He appeals to the ancient Sanscreet records, which mention a migration from India of certain of the military class termed Chinas to the countries east from Bengal. The stationary condition of the arts and sciences in China proves that these have not originated with that people ; and many pe culiarities of the manners, institutions, and po pular religion of the Chinese, have a near affi nity with those of the Hindoos."], [319, "SECT. 49. 301 MODERN HISTORY. 4. The government of China is that of an absolute monarchy. The patriarchal system pervades the whole, and binds all the members of this vast empire in the strictest subordination. Every father is absolute in his family, and may inflict any punishment short of death upon his children. The mandarin of the district is abso lute, with the power of life and death over all its members ; but a capital sentence cannot be inflicted without the Emperor's approbation. The Emperor's power is absolute over all the mandarins, and every subject of the empire. To reconcile the people to this despotic au- thority, the sovereign alone is entitled to relieve the wants of the poor, and to compensate public calamities, as well as the misfortunes of indivi- duals. He is therefore regarded as the father of his people, and even adored as a benevolent divinity. 5. Another circumstance which conciliates the people to their government is, that all ho nours in China are conferred according to merit, and that chiefly literary. The civil mandarins, who are the magistrates and judges, are appointed to office according to their measure of knowledge and mental endowments. No office or rank is hereditary, but may be aspired to by the meanest"], [320, "302 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. of the people; [and it may be regarded as a great proof of the discernment of some of the Em- perors, and of their deference to public opinion, that they have been known in a very extraordi- nary manner, to honour the memory of able and virtuous ministers. One of the princes of their thirteenth dynasty, not only built a superb mausoleum to commemorate the wisdom and virtues of one of his servants, but wrote the in- scription for it, with his own hand, though he had to record that he had himself not unfre- quently been the object of his just and honest reproofs.] The penal laws of China are re- markably severe, but their execution may be remitted by the Emperor. The judicial tribu- nals are regulated by a body of written laws of great antiquity, and founded on the basis of universal justice and equity. The Emperor's opinion rarely differs from the sentences of those courts. One tribunal judges of the qualifica- tions of the mandarins ; another regulates the morals of the people, and the national manners ; a third is the tribunal of censors, which reviews the laws, the conduct of the magistrates and judges, and even that of the Emperor himself. These tribunals are filled by an equal number of Chinese and Tartars."], [321, "SECT. 49. 303 MODERN HISTORY. 6. It has been observed, that the sciences have been stationary in this empire for many ages ; and they are at this day extremely low, though far beyond the attainments of a barba rous people. The language of China seems to oppose the prosecution of speculative researches. It has no regular inflections, and can with diffi culty express abstract ideas. We have re marked the ignorance of the Chinese in mathe matics and astronomy. Of physics they have no acquaintance beyond the knowledge of ap parent facts. They never ascend to principles or form theories. Their knowledge of medicine is extremely limited, and is blended with the most contemptible superstition. Of anatomy, they know next to nothing; and in surgery they have never ventured to amputate a limb, or to reduce a fracture. 7. The state of the useful and elegant arts has been equally stationary as that of the sci ences. They have attained many ages ago to a certain point of advancement, which they have never gone beyond. The Chinese are said to have manufactured glass for 2000 years, yet at this day it is inferior in transparency to the Eu ropean, and is not used in their windows. Gun powder they are reported to have known from"], [322, "304 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. time immemorial, but they never employed it in artillery or fire-arms till taught by the Europeans. Printing they are said to have invented in the age of Julius C\u00e6sar; yet they know not the use of moveable types, but print from blocks of wood. When first shown the use of the com pass in sailing, they affirmed that they were well acquainted with it, but found no occasion to employ it. The art of painting in China is mere mechanical imitation, without grace, expression, or even accuracy of proportions. Of the rules of perspective they have not the smallest idea. In sculpture, as in the figures of their idols, the Chinese artists seem to delight in distortion and deformity. Their music is not regulated by any principles of science : they have no semitones ; and their instruments are imperfect and untun able. The Chinese architecture has variety, lightness, and sometimes elegance, but has no grandeur or symmetrical beauty. 8. Yet, in some of the arts, the Chinese have attained to great perfection. Agriculture is carried in China to the highest pitch of im provement. There is not a spot of waste land in the whole empire, nor any which is not highly cultivated. The Emperor himself is the chief of the husbandmen, and annually holds the"], [323, "SECT. 49. 305 MODERN HISTORY. plough with his own hands. Hence, and from the modes of economising food, is supported the astonishing population of 333 millions, or 260 inhabitants to every square mile of the empire. The gardening of the Chinese, and their admir able embellishment of rural nature, have of late been the object of imitation in Europe, but with far inferior success. The manufacture of porce lain is an original invention of this people ; and the Europeans, though excelling them in the form and ornament of the utensils, have never been able to attain to the excellence of the material. 9. The morals of the Chinese have furnished much subject both of encomium and censure. The books of Confucius are said to contain a most admirable system of morality; but the principles of morals have their foundation in human nature, and must, in theory, be every where the same. The moral virtues of a people are not to be estimated from the books of their philosophers. It is probable that the manners of the superior classes are in China, as elsewhere, much influenced by education and example. The morals of the lower classes are said to be beyond measure loose, and their practices most dishonest; nor are they regulated by any prin- vol. 11. x"], [324, "306 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. ciple but selfish interest, or restrained but by the fear of punishment. 10. The religion of the Chinese is different in the different ranks of society. There is no religion of the state. The Emperor and the higher mandarins profess the belief of one Su preme Being, Changti, whom they worship by prayer and thanksgiving, without any mixture of idolatrous practices. They respect the Lama of Thibet as the high-priest or prophet of this religion. A prevalent sect is that of Tao-sse, who believe in the power of magic, the agency of spirits, and the divining of future events. A third is the sect of Fo, derived from India, whose priests are the Bonzes, and whose funda mental doctrine is, that all tilings rose out of nothing, and finally must return to it ; that all animals are first to undergo a series of transmi grations ; and that a man's chief happiness is to approach as near as possible to a state of anni hilation in this life, absolute idleness is more laudable than occupation of any kind. A variety of hideous idols are worshipped by this sect. 11. The Chinese have their sacred books, termed Kings ; as the Yking, Chouking, &c. ; which, amidst some good moral precepts, con-"], [325, "SECT. 49. MODERN HISTORY. 307 tain much mystery, childish superstition, and absurdity. These are chiefly resorted to for the divining of future events, which seems the ulti matum of research among the Chinese philoso phers. The observation of the heavenly bodies is made for that purpose alone : the changes of weather, the performance or omission of certain ceremonies, the occurrence of certain events in particular times and places, are all believed to have their influence on futurity, and are there fore carefully observed and recorded ; and the rules by which those omens are interpreted are said to have been prescribed by the great Con fucius, the father of the Chinese philosophy, 500 years before the Christian \u00e6ra. 12. We conclude, on the whole, that the Chinese are a very remarkable people ; that their government, laws, policy, and knowledge of the arts and sciences, exhibit unquestionable proofs of great antiquity and early civilisation; but that the extraordinary measure of duration assigned to their empire by some modern writers rests on no solid proofs ; nor are their government, laws, manners, arts, or scientific attainments, at all deserving of that superlative and most exag gerated encomium which has been bestowed on them. x 2"], [326, "308 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. L. M. BAILLY's THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE SCIENCES AMONG THE NATIONS OF ASIA. 1. The striking resemblance in many points of character between the Chinese and ancient Egyptians has led to the conjecture, either that they were originally the same people, the one being a colony of the other, or that the two nations have had at some remote period such intercourse, either by conquest or in the way of commerce, as to occasion a reciprocal commu nication of manners, arts, and knowledge of the sciences. M. de Mairan has remarked the fol lowing points of similarity. The Egyptians and Chinese had the same permanence of manners, and abhorrence of innovations ; they were alike remarkable for the respect entertained by chil dren to their parents ; they were equally averse to war ; they had the same general but super ficial knowledge in the arts and sciences, with out the ability to make great attainments ; they both, in the most ancient times, used hierogly-"], [327, "\u00a3ECT. 50. . MODERN HISTORY. 309 phics; the Egyptians had a solemn festival, called the Feast of the Lights ; the Chinese have the Feast of the Lanterns ; the features of the Chinese are said to resemble the ancient Egyp tian statues ; certain characters engraven on an Egyptian bust of Isis were found to belong to the Chinese language. ****** \u00a3\"*> 2. M. Bailly has taken a wider range of observations, and has, from a review of the manners, customs, opinions, and attainments of the Indians, Persians, Chinese, Chald\u00e6ans, and Egyptians, discovered many circumstances of similarity between all those nations equally re markable as the foregoing. He has thence formed the singular hypothesis, that the know ledge common to the whole of those nations has been derived from the same original source, namely, a most ancient and highly cultivated people of Asia, of whose memory every trace is now extinct, but who have been the parent in structors of all around them. If we find, says he, in the scattered huts of peasants, fragments interspersed of sculptured columns, we conclude for certain that these are not the work of the rude peasants who reared those huts, but that they are the remains of a magnificent building, the work of able architects, though we discover x 3"], [328, "310 MODERN HISTORf. PART If. no other traces of the existence of that building, and cannot ascertain its precise situation. 3. The sciences and arts of the Chinese have been stationary for 2000 years. The people seem never to have availed themselves of the lights of their ancestors. They are like the inhabitants of a country recently discovered by a polished people, who have taught them some of their arts, and left their instruments among them. The knowledge they possess seems to have been imported, and not of original growth, for it has never been progressive. 4. The Chald\u00e6ans were an enlightened people at the commencement of the Babylonish empire, 2000 years before the Christian \u00e6ra.\u2014 They were great astronomers, and understood the revolutions of comets, which became known to the moderns only in the sixteenth century. The Chald\u00e6ans were probably the remains of this ancient people. The Bramins of India believe in the unity of God and the immortality of the soul, but with these sublime tenets they intermix the most childish absurdities. They derived the former from wise instructors, the latter were the fruit of their own ignorance. The Sanscreet, a most copious and elegant language, and the vehicle of all the Indian 16"], [329, "SECT. 50. MODERN HISTORY. 311 knowledge and philosophy, has been a dead tongue for thousands of years, and is intelligible only to a few of those Bramins. It was pro bably the language of that great ancient people. 5. The coincidence or similarity of customs concurs to establish the same idea. The cus tom of libation was common to the Tartars and Chinese, as well as to the Greeks and Romans. All the Asiatic nations had festivals of the na ture of the Roman Saturnalia. The tradition of the deluge is diffused among all those nations : the tradition of the giants attacking heaven is equally general. The doctrine of the metemp sychosis was common to the Egyptians, Greeks, Indians, Persians, Tartarians, and Chinese. The religion of all these nations is founded on the profound, though erroneous, doctrine of the two principles, an universal soul pervading all nature, and inert matter on which it acts. A conformity in a true doctrine is no proof of mutual communication or concert; but it is ingeniously remarked, that a conformity in a false doctrine comes very near to such a proof. 6. The Egyptians, Chald\u00e6ans, Indians, Per sians, and Chinese, all placed their temples fronting the East, to receive the first rays of the sun. The worship of the sun has been the x 4"], [330, "312 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. religion of that ancient people. All the above mentioned nations had a cycle, or period of sixty years, for regulating their chronology : they all divided the circle into 360 degrees, the zodiac into twelve signs, and the week into seven days ; and the Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians de signed those days by the names of the planets ranged in the same order. The long measures of the ancient nations had all one common origin. 7. These singular coincidences, argues M. Bailly, can be accounted for only by three sup positions: 1. That there was a free communi cation between all those ancient nations : 2. That those circumstances of coincidence are so founded in human nature, that the most un connected nations could not fail to hit upon them : or, 3. That they have been all derived from a common source. He rejects the two former suppositions, as contrary in his opinion to fact, and rests, of course, upon the last. 8. The precise situation of this great ancient people M. Bailly does not pretend to fix with certainty ; but he offers probable reasons for conjecturing that it was about the 49th or 50th degree of north latitude, in the southern regions of Siberia. Many of the European and Asiatic"], [331, "SECT. 50. MODERN HISTORY. 313 nations attribute their origin to that quarter, which thence appears to have been extremely populous. Nitre, a production from animal sub stances, is more abundant there than in any other region. The observations of the rising of the stars, collected by Ptolemy, must have been made in a climate where the longest day was sixteen hours, which corresponds to the latitude mentioned. No European nation in that latitude understood astronomy in those early periods. The veneration of the Indians and Chinese for the Lama of Thibet is a proof that the religion of those nations originated in that quarter. 9. But does that region exhibit any traces of having been ever inhabited by a polished people? It is here that the theory of M. Bailly seems to be least supported by proof. He observes, that ancient mines have been disco vered in those parts of Siberia, which have been wrought to great extent in a period beyond all record or tradition ; that ancient sepulchres have been found, in which there were ornaments of gold of skilful workmanship ; but the facts specified are so few as to warrant no positive inference. 10. This theory is an amusing specimen of the author's ingenuity ; but it has not the force"], [332, "314 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. to draw our assent to his conclusions. We have noticed it, as specifying many curious facts re lative to the manners and attainments of the ancient nations, and as furnishing strong evi dence of the common origin of mankind. The nations above mentioned, though many of them remote from each other, were all connected, as links of a chain, by proximity ; whence it is easy to conceive that knowledge should diverge from a centre to a very distant circumference. M. Bailly has given no reasonable grounds for fixing that centre in the position he has as signed it. LI. REIGN OF PHILIP II. OF SPAIN. \u2014 REVOLUTION OF THE NETHERLANDS, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF HOLLAND. 1. After a short survey of the Asiatic king doms, we return to the history of Europe in the sixteenth century. In the time of Philip II., the successor of Charles V., the balance of power in Europe was sustained by Spain, France, England, and Ger-"], [333, "SECT. 51. 315 MODERN HISTORY. many, all at this time highly flourishing and re spectable, either from the talents of their so vereigns, or their internal strength ; [though England was more encumbered, and more vul nerable than the rest, owing to the bad footing she was upon, both with Scotland and Ireland, and of which her rivals knew but too well how to take advantage.] Elizabeth, Henry IV., and Philip II., were all acute and able politicians, though the policy of the last partook more of selfish craft, and had less of the manly and heroic, than that of either of his rival monarchs. Philip was at this time Sovereign of Spain, the Two Sicilies, Milan, and the Netherlands. He had likewise, for a few years, the power of Eng land at his command, by his marriage with Mary, the elder sister and predecessor of Eli zabeth. 2. Pope Paul IV., jealous of the power of Philip, formed an alliance with Henry II. of France to deprive the Spaniards of Milan and the Sicilies, [most of the cardinals being in op position to him, as pensioners of the Spanish court.] Philip, with the aid of the English, [at the moment that the Duke of Guise was ad vancing towards the south,] defeated the French at St. Quintin in Picardy, and hoped, from this"], [334, "316 PART lit MODERN HISTORY. signal victory, [the whole of the French infantry being destroyed, and almost all the general officers taken prisoners,] to force the allies into a peace ; but the Duke of Guise [re turning in good time from Italy,] recovered the spirits of the French by the taking of Calais from the English, which they had now possessed for [more than] 200 years. Another great victory, however, obtained by Philip near Grave lines, brought on the treaty of Catteau-Cam bresis, in 1559, by which the French surren dered to Spain no less than eighty-nine fortified towns in the Low Countries and in Italy. 3. Philip, now at ease from foreign disturb ances, began to be disquieted on the score of religion. An intolerant bigot by nature, he resolved to extirpate every species of heresy from his dominions. The Netherlands, an as semblage of separate states, were all subject to Philip, under various titles ; and he had con ferred the government of Holland, Zealand, Friesland, and Utrecht, on William Prince of Orange, a Count of the German empire. The Lutheran and Calvinistic opinions had made great progress in those quarters; and Philip, de termining to repress them, [and not distinguish ing properly between his northern and southern subjects,] established the Inquisition with plenary"], [335, "SECT. 51. 317 MODERN HISTORY. powers, created new bishops, and prepared to abrogate the ancient laws, and give the pro vinces a new political institution. [It would seem as if he had forgotten how mighty a king dom was interposed between him and his Flemish subjects, as well as the near neighbourhood of England, which, after the death of Mary, had once more become Protestant.] These innova tions [as might naturally have been expected,] creating alarm and tumult, the Duke of Alva was sent into Flanders [at the head of Spanish and Italian troops,] to enforce implicit submission. ; 4. The Inquisition began its bloody work, and many of the principal nobility of the pro vinces were its victims, [particularly the Counts Egmont and Horn, who were not only justly lamented, but to the former of whom Philip had been indebted, but a short time before, for a considerable victory over the French.] The minds of the people were completely alienated, and a chief was only wanting to give union to their measures. The Prince of Orange, who was himself under sentence of the Inquisition, found no difficulty to raise an army, and having easily reduced some of the most important garri sons, he was proclaimed Stadtholder of Holland and Zealand in 1570, [and the Romish religion"], [336, "PART II. 318 MODERN HISTORY. was immediately abolished.] Eighteen thousand persons perished by the hands of the execu tioner in the course of the Duke of Alva's government, which was of five years' duration. His place was supplied by Requesens, a man of humanity, but bound to obey his inhuman master, who, on the death of Requesens, sent his natural brother Don John of Austria [the hero of Lepanto, (see supra, Sect. XLIV.)] to endeavour to regain the revolted states : but the attempt was fruitless. [Philip indeed appears to have relied more upon the high character his brother bore, than upon any particular con fidence he was personally disposed to place in him.] The whole seventeen provinces had suf fered alike from the tyranny of their sovereign ; but particular jealousies prevented a general union, and only seven of these asserted their in dependence by a solemn treaty formed at Utrecht, 23d January, 1579 ; by which it was agreed that they should defend their liberties as one united republic ; that they should jointly determine in matters of peace and war, establish a general legislative authority, and maintain a liberty of conscience in matters of religion. These seven United Provinces were, Guelderland, Holland, Zealand, Friesland, Utrecht, Overyssel, and"], [337, "SECT. 51. 319 MODERN HISTORY. Groningen. William Prince of Orange was declared their chief magistrate, general, and admiral, by the title of Stadtholder. 5. Philip [from his cabinet at Madrid, for he kept aloof himself from all these commotions,] vented his indignation by a proscription of the Prince of Orange, offering [aster the example of the French, who had done the same by the Prince's father-in-law, Coligni,] 25,000 crowns for his head ; and he compassed his revenge ; for this illustrious man was cut off by an assassin, 1584, [not exactly through hope of the reward, but through religious fanaticism, \" the crime of the times,\" as a celebrated writer calls it.] His son Maurice was elected Stadtholder in his room, and sustained his important part with great courage and ability ; [though opposed to one of the greatest Generals of the day, Alex ander Farnese Duke of Parma, grandson of Charles V.,] with a slender aid from Elizabeth of England, who delighted to traverse the plans of Philip, this infant commonwealth accom plished and secured its independence, [becom ing every day more formidable at sea, where she was soon as able to cope with her oppressor, as on land.]"], [338, "320 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 6. The other ten provinces, whose discontents were expressed only by murmur and complaint, were soothed by a new charter from Philip, con firming their privileges ; while at the same time he took every possible measure to prevent any attempt on their part to throw off the yoke. [These provinces continued to profess the Catholic faith.] LII. OF THE CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED PROVINCES. 1. The treaty of confederation of the Seven United Provinces, framed in 1579, and solemnly renewed in 158m was declared to be, by its nature, indissoluble. Each province thereby preserved its own laws, its magistrates, its sove reignty, and its independence. They formed, however, one body politic, renouncing the right of making separate alliances and treaties, and establishing a general council, with power of assembling the states and regulating the common affairs of the republic. The assembly of the States-General was originally held only twice a year, but became afterwards a perpetual council."], [339, "SECT. 52. 321 MODERN HISTORY. 2. In all matters which regard not the general interest of the nation, each of the states or provinces was in itself a republic, governed by its own laws and magistrates, and possessing a supreme legislative authority. The deputies from each of the towns formed the council of the province, in which was vested its separate government ; and these deputies were regulated by the instructions of their constituents. The votes of the majority of deputies decided in the provincial council in all matters which regarded not the general interest of the nation. 3. The great council of the States-General, always met in assembly at the Hague, com posed of the deputies from the Seven Provinces, of which Holland sent three, Zealand and Utrecht two, and the others one; each deputy being regulated by the council M his province. A majority of voices was here decisive, unless in the great questions of peace, war, and alliance, in which unanimity was requisite. The dis advantage of this constitution was the delay and difficulty in the execution of public measures. All the towns and all the nobles of a province had to deliberate, and instruct their deputy, before the States-General could take the matter under consideration. This great defect was in VOL. II. y"], [340, "322 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. some measure corrected by the power and in fluence of the Stadtholder. 4. The Stadtholder was commander-in-chief of the sea and land forces, and disposed of all the military employments. He presided over all the courts of justice, and had the power of pardoning crimes. He appointed the magis trates of the towns from a list made by them selves ; received and named ambassadors, and stood charged with the execution of the laws. He was supreme arbiter in all differences be tween the provinces, cities, or other members of the state. 5. William, the first Stadtholder, did not abuse these high powers ; nor did his succes sors, Maurice and Henry Frederick. But under William II. the states became jealous of an ex orbitant authority in their chief magistrate, and on his death the office was for some time abo lished. In that interval the republic was almost annihilated by the arms of Louis XIV. ; and, sensible of their error, they restored the office of Stadtholder in the person of William III., who retrieved the fortunes and honour of his country. In gratitude for his services, the dignity was made hereditary in his family, a solecism in the government of a republic. On the death of 21"], [341, "SECT. 53. 323 MODERN HISTORY. William without issue, the office was once more abolished for twenty years, when it was again restored, declared hereditary in the family of Orange, and descendible even to the issue of a daughter. The only restrictions being, that the succeeding Prince should be of the Pro testant religion, and neither King nor Elector of the German empire. LIII. REIGN OF PHILIP II. CONTINUED. 1. The loss of the Netherlands was in some degree compensated to Philip II. by the ac quisition of the kingdom of Portugal. Muley Mahomet, King of Fez and Morocco, dethroned by his uncle Muley Moluc, solicited the aid of Don Sebastian King of Portugal to regain his throne. Sebastian landed with an army in Africa, but was defeated by the Moors, and slain; [and not one man of his whole army returned to Portugal ; j . e contending Moorish princes also perished in the same engagement. Sebas tian was succeeded by his grand-uncle Don Henry, [a priest and cardinal,] who died after Y 2"], [342, "324 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. a reign of two years. The competitors for the crown were Don Antonio, Prior of Crato, and Philip II., paternal and maternal uncles of the last sovereign. [It is said that even Pope GregoryXIII. claimed it as reverting regularly to the Holy See in default of heirs male.] Philip defeated his rival in a decisive engagement at sea, [the French supporting the latter,] and, without further opposition, took possession of the throne of Portugal, 1580. 2. Elizabeth of England had warmly espoused the cause of the revolted Netherlands, and her admiral, Sir Francis Drake, [in his voyage round the world,] had taken some of the Spanish set tlements in America ; [she had also exposed her self generally to the resentment of the Catholics by her treatment of the Scottish queen.] To avenge these injuries, [and provocations,] the In vincible Armada of 150 ships of war, 27,000 men, and 3000 pieces of cannon, was equipped by Philip for the invasion of England, [while an army of 30,000 men, under the Duke of Parma, lay ready in Flanders to join the expedition.] The English fleet of 108 ships attacked them, however, in the night, and burnt and destroyed a great part of the squadron ; a storm, which drove them on the rocks and sands of Zealand, com-"], [343, "SECT. 53. MODERN HISTORY. 325 pleted their discomfiture, and only fifty shattered vessels, with 6000 men, [after having been obliged to go round by the North Seas,] re turned to Spain, 1588. 3. The restless spirit of Philip II. was en gaged at the same time in the reduction of the Netherlands, the project for the invasion of England, and the dismembering the kingdom of France. The last scheme was as ineffectual as we have seen the two former. It was de feated at once by the conversion of Henry IV. to the Catholic religion. The policy of Philip had nothing in it great or generous. His restless ambition was fitted to embroil Europe, but he had not the judgment to turn the distresses he occa sioned to his own advantage. In his own king doms, as in his domestic life, he was a gloomy and inhuman tyrant. Yet from the variety and magnitude of his designs, the power by which they were supported, and the splendour of his dominion, the character of Spain was high and respectable in the scale of the nations of Europe. [In fact, the dominions of Philip, after he got possession of Portugal and her foreign settlements, may fairly be said to have extended to the extremities of America and Asia, and his revenues were in proportion. Of the chance y 3"], [344, "326 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. he had of obtaining the sovereign power in France, an account will be given in the next sec tion. Philip died at the age of seventy-one, September 1598, with the character of a pow erful, but by no means of a good or a great king.] LIV. STATE OF FRANCE IN THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. UNDER HENRY II., FRANCIS II., CHARLES IX., HENRY III., AND HENRY IV. 1. The reformed religion had made the greater progress in France from the impolitic persecution it sustained from Henry II., the son and successor of Francis I., who, though he aided the Protestants of Germany in resisting the despotism of Charles V., showed no mercy to their brethren in his own kingdom, [his own religious sentiments, indeed, continued unshaken. But besides this, he wished to stand well with the Pope, to further his views upon Naples and Sicily ; his conduct, therefore, to his own Pro-"], [345, "SECT. 54. MODERN HISTORY. 327 testant subjects amounted to persecution, and had the effect of driving many into rebellion.] 2. On the death of Henry II. the conspiracy of Amboise was planned by the Prince of Conde, for the destruction of the Duke of Guise, who ruled the kingdom under Francis II., and to whose intolerance and cruelty the Protestants attributed all their calamities. Guise owed his ascendancy chiefly to the marriage of his niece, Mary Queen of Scots, with the young monarch ; and the detection of this conspiracy, the mas sacre of its principal leaders, and the barbarous punishment of all who partook in it, while they confirmed his power, served only to increase the rancour of the contending parties. 3. Francis II. died after a reign of a year, 1560, and was succeeded by his brother Charles IX., a boy of ten years of age ; [when Francis died, the Prince of Conde was not only imprisoned, but actually sentenced to be be headed, but the young King set him free.] The Queen-Mother, Catharine de Medicis, [ap pointed guardian of her son, by the states,] who had no other principle but the love of power, was equally jealous of the influence of the Condes and the Guises. An ecclesiastical assembly, [or con ference between the Catholics and Protestants,] Y 4"], [346, "328 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. held by her desire at Poissy, gave toleration to the latter to exercise their worship through all France, without the walls of the towns. The zeal or the imprudence of the Duke of Guise in fringed this ordinance, [by rashly disturbing a congregation, who, under the sanction of the new edict, were peaceably performing service in a barn, without the walls of the town of Vassi, in Champagne,] and both parties flew to arms. The Admiral Coligni headed the troops of the Protestants, who were aided by 10,000 Germans from the Palatinate ; and Philip of Spain, to in crease the disorders, sent an army to the aid of the Catholics. 4. The horrors of civil war were aggravated by murders and assassinations. The Duke of Guise [the idol of the Catholics, brave and ge nerous to a high degree, had he lived in better times,] was the victim of the frantic zeal of an enthusiast. After many desperate engagements with various success, [in one of which the Prince of Conde, having fallen into the hands of his enemies, was cruelly assassinated,] a treach erous peace was agreed to by the Catholics ; and Coligni, with the chiefs of the Protestant party, were invited to court, and received by the Queen- Mother and her son with the most extraordinary 20"], [347, "SECT. 54. MODERN HISTORY. 329 marks of favour : among the rest Henry of Navarre, to whom the young monarch had given his sister in marriage. Such were the prepar atives to the infernal massacre of St. Bartholo mew. On the night of the 23d of August, 1572, at the ringing of the matin-bell, a general mas sacre was made by the Catholics of all the Pro testants throughout the kingdom of France. Charles IX., a monster of cruelty, assisted him self in the murder of his own subjects. 5. Amidst these horrors, Henry Duke of An jou, brother of Charles IX., was elected King of Poland, but had scarcely taken possession of his throne, [which he reluctantly accepted, and regarded as a banishment,] when he was called to that of France by the death of its execrable sovereign, 1574. The weakness of the new monarch Henry III. [who lost no time in mak ing his escape from Poland, only to fall into fresh troubles,] was ill fitted to compose the dis orders of the kingdom. Equally bigotted and profligate, he became the scorn of his subjects, and the dupe of the contending factions. 6. The Protestant party was now supported by the Prince of Conde and young Henry of Navarre, descended from Robert of Bourbon, a younger son of Lewis IX. The Duke of Alen-"], [348, "330 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. con, the King's brother, had likewise joined their party. The Catholics, to accumulate then- strength, formed [in 1576,] a bond of union, termed the League, nominally for defence of the state and its religion, but in reality for usurping all the powers of government, and sup- pressing the Protestant faith. Of this dangerous association Henry III., with the weakest policy, declared himself the head, and thus the avowed enemy of one half of his subjects. He saw his error when too late ; and dreading the designs of the Duke of Guise, and his brother the Car- dinal of Lorraine, whose authority had super- seded his own, he basely rid himself of his fears by procuring their assassination, [though he had not long before received the holy communion with them, which rendered the deed more hor- rible.] This vicious and contemptible tyrant, after a reign of fifteen years, was himself assas- sinated by Jacques Clement, a Jacobin monk, from the phrenzy of fanaticism, 1589. 7. The next heir of the crown was Henry of Navarre, who had been educated a Pro testant by his mother, the daughter of Henry D'Albret, King of Navarre. At the age of sixteen he had been declared head of the party of the Huguenots ; his uncle the Prince of"], [349, "SECT. 54. MODERN HISTORY. 331 Conde and the Admiral Coligni acting as his lieutenants. His first military enterprises were unsuccessful. Invited to Paris, at the peace of 1572, to marry the sister of Charles IX., he narrowly escaped from the massacre of St. Bar tholomew, but remained three years a prisoner. On the death of Charles, he again took the field against the army of the League, which he defeated in the battle of Coutras, 1587, a\"d still more signally in that of Arques, 1589. After the death of Henry III., [with whom he was at that time associated against the House of Lorraine,] he won the celebrated battle oflvry ; and being acknowledged sovereign of France by all but the party of the League, then in posses sion of Paris, he laid siege to the city, which must have capitulated, but for the succours of Philip II. [and Pope Gregory IV. ; for Henry had then to contend against France, Rome, and Spain.] Religion was the sole cause of the disunion of France, and the only obstacle to the acknowledgment of Henry's title by the greatest part of his subjects. [This it was which gave so great an advantage to Philip II., that even after the assassination of Henry III., the remains of the League, particularly the council of sixteen, had actually proposed to put every"], [350, "332 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. thing into his hands, under the title of Protector of the realm ; but at this critical moment, and] at the earnest persuasion of Rosni (Duke of Sully), himself a Protestant, Henry was pre vailed on to declare himself a Catholic. He abjured at St. Denis, and was crowned King at Chartres, 1594. He soon after took possession of Paris ; but it cost him several years, both of war and negociation, before he gained the whole of his kingdom, exhausted as it was and ruined by civil discord. 8. The subsequent life of this excellent prince was devoted to the reparation of these misfor tunes. After forcing Philip II. [who had hitherto refrained from giving him any higher title than Prince of Beam, and done all he could do to prevent the Pope's withdrawing his sen tence of excommunication, after he had abjured the Calvinistic faith,] to conclude the advanta geous peace of Vervins, 1598, his whole atten tion was bestowed on the improvement of his kingdom, by reforming its laws, regulating its finances, encouraging agriculture and manufac tures, enlarging and embellishing the cities, and finally by successfully reconciling the partisans of the contending religions.

The period of the splendour and happiness of France was of short duration. Henry IV., worthy to be immortal, was assassinated at the age of fifty-seven, 4th May, 1610, by Ravaillac, an insane fanatic.

Had Elizabeth been equally endowed with the virtues of the heart as with the powers of the mind, she would have shone the most illustrious character in the annals of modern Europe. Her conduct to her cousin Mary Queen of Scots has fixed an indelible stain on her character. Mary, the daughter of James V., and great-grand daughter of Henry VII., educated in France, and married, when very young, to the Dauphin, afterwards Francis II., had imprudently assumed the arms and title of Queen of England, by the persuasion of her maternal uncles the Guises. The pretence was the illegitimacy of Elizabeth, declared by Henry VIIL on his divorce from Anna Bullen. This false step laid the found ation of all the miseries of the Queen of Scots. [Though it has been exceedingly well observed, that there was no cause wanting to produce an enmity between these near relations, there being a constant rivalship and competition of nation, crown, religion, wit, and beauty.]"], [354, "336 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 3. The Reformation was at this time going forward in Scotland with the most ardent zeal. The Earls of Argyle, Morton, Glencairn, and others, its chief promoters, had, by their own authority, suppressed the worship of the mass over a great part of the kingdom. The Catholic bishops, by an ill-judged persecution of the Re formers, greatly increased the number of their proselytes. They began to muster their strength ; and headed by John Knox, a disciple of Calvin, a virtuous man, but of the most furious and in temperate zeal, threw down the altars and images, expelled the priests, and demolished the churches and monasteries. Acting now in arms, and in open defiance of government, the Queen-Mother, Mary of Guise, attempted, by the aid of French troops, to reduce her Protestant subjects to submission ; and these applied for aid to the Protestant Queen of England. Eli zabeth sent an army and a fleet to their assist ance. The death of the Queen-Mother was followed by a capitulation, by which it was agreed that the French should evacuate Scot land, and that Mary should renounce all preten sion to the crown of England.

In this situation of Scotland, Mary, at the age of eighteen, on the death of her mother, and of her husband Francis II., returned to her hereditary kingdom ; having fortunately escaped an English fleet which Elizabeth had dispatched to take her prisoner on her passage. Her mis fortunes began from that hour. Her Protestant subjects regarded their Catholic Queen with abhorrence, and looked up to her enemy Eliza beth as their support and defender. That artful Princess had secured to her interest the very men on whom the unsuspecting Mary placed her utmost confidence, her bastard-brother the Earl of Murray, the Earl of Morton, and Secre tary Lethington. The views of Murray aimed at nothing less than his sister's crown, and the obstacles which opposed his criminal ambition served only to render his attempts more daring and more flagitious. 5. The marriage of Mary with her cousin Lord Darnley, [a Catholic as well as herself,] son of the Earl of Lennox, who stood in the same relation to Elizabeth, was not relished by that Princess. Encouraged by her ministers, Randolph and Cecil, Murray formed a conspi racy to seize and imprison the Queen, and put to death her husband, and usurp the govern- z VOL.

Defeated, exiled, pardoned, and loaded with benefits by his injured Sovereign, he persevered in the same atrocious purposes, till he at length accomplished them. 6. The spouse of Mary had incurred her re sentment by his vices and his follies. Taking advantage of the weakness of his mind, Murray, Morton, and Lethington had rendered him jea lous of* the partiality of Mary for her foreign secretary, the aged Rizzio, and engaged him in the barbarous act of murdering this ill-fated wretch at the feet of the Queen, to whose gar ments he clung for protection. The purpose of this shocking outrage was to procure the abor tion of Mary, then big with child, and possibly her death ; or should she survive, to alienate completely her affections from her husband, and thus to render her suspected of the design they had projected of cutting him off by assassination. In the latter purpose they succeeded. The house which Darnley inhabited was blown up by gunpowder ; his body was found strangled near the place, and the report immediately pre vailed that Mary had been accessary to his murder."], [357, "SECT. 55. MODERN HISTORY. 339 7- A most imprudent step, to which she was conducted by the same band of traitors, gave countenance to this suspicion. At the earnest recommendation of Morton and some of her chief nobility, she married the Earl of Bothwell, a man openly stigmatised as one of the mur derers of her husband. He had, it is true, been absolved on trial for that crime, and had by force made himself master of her person. The plans of Murray and his associates, successful to the utmost of their wishes, were now ripe for consummation. On the pretext of the Queen's guilt of murder and adultery, she was confined by Murray in the castle of Lochleven, and there compelled to resign her crown into the hands of her unnatural brother, who was to govern the kingdom as Regent during the minority of her infant son, now proclaimed King by the title of James VI., 1567. Bothwell escaped beyond seas, and died in Denmark. 8. A great part of the nation reprobated these infamous proceedings. Mary escaped from her confinement ; and at the head of an army gave battle to the rebels at Langside ; but, being defeated, she fled for shelter to the north of England. Elizabeth, who had secretly taken part in all the machinations of her enemies, had z 2"], [358, "340 PART II MODERN HISTORY. now gained a great object of her ambition ; she had in her hands a hated rival, and by her sup port of Murray and his party, the absolute command of the kingdom of Scotland. Yet policy required some show of friendship and humanity to the Queen of Scots, who claimed as a suppliant her protection and aid. She professed her desire to do her justice, but first required that she should clear herself of the crimes alleged against her. To this Mary agreed, in the intrepidity of conscious innocence. In a conference held for that purpose, Murray openly stood forth as the accuser of his sister and Queen, appealing to certain letters said to be written by her to Bothwell, plainly intimating her guilt. Copies of these letters were produced. Mary demanded the originals, boldly declaring them to be the forgeries of her enemies ; but they were never produced. She retorted on Murray and Morton the charge of Darnley's murder ; and the conference was broken off at the com mand of the Queen of England, who detained Mary in close imprisonment. 9. The ungenerous policy of Elizabeth was condemned by her own subjects. The Duke of Norfolk, the first of her nobility, and, though a Protestant, favoured by the Catholic party in"], [359, "SECT. 55. MODERN HISTORY. 341 England, secretly projected to marry the Queen of Scots ; and the discovery of these views giving alarm to Elizabeth, brought that ill-fated noble man to the block, and hastened the doom of the unfortunate Mary. Worn out with the miseries of her confinement, she privately solicited the aid of foreign princes for her deliverance. Her cause was espoused by all the Catholics of Eng land ; and some of the most intemperate of these [animated, if not encouraged, by the Princes of Guise, the holy See, the Jesuits, and the Spa niards,] had formed a plot to deliver her from captivity, and to place her on the throne by the murder of Elizabeth. This dangerous conspi racy was discovered, and its authors [to the number of fourteen] deservedly suffered death. The schemes of Mary for her own deliverance were held presumptive of her acquiescence in the whole of the plot. Though an independent sovereign, she was brought to trial before a fo reign tribunal, which had already decreed her fate ; and being condemned to suffer death, she was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle, 1587, in the forty-fifth year of her age, and nineteenth of her captivity in England. Previously to this event, Murray had fallen the victim of the pri vate revenge of a gentleman whom he had injured, z 3"], [360, "342 PART II.

We have noticed the formidable prepara tions of Philip II. for the invasion of England, and their disastrous issue in the total destruction of the invincible Armada. The English, in their turn, made descents on the Spanish coasts ; and the glory of the nation was nobly sustained by those great Admirals, Rawleigh, Howard, Drake, Cavendish, and Hawkins. The Earl of Essex distinguished himself in those expeditions, and won the favour of Elizabeth, both by his prowess and personal accomplishments. The death of Leicester, her former favourite, and of her minister Burleigh, left Essex unrivalled in her affections, and of chief authority in the di rection of her councils. Haughty and impa tient of control, he disgusted the nobles ; and his failure in quelling a rebellion in Ireland gave them ground to undermine him in the favour of his sovereign. In the madness of inordinate ambition, he proposed to possess himself of the person of the Queen, and compel her to remove his enemies, and acquiesce in all his measures."], [361, "SECT. 56. 343 MODERN HISTORY. This treasonable enterprise brought him to the scaffold, 1600. 11. From that time Elizabeth fell into pro found melancholy, and soon after died in the seventieth year of her age, 1603, having named for her successor James VI. King of Scotland. Her talents were great, and the firmness of her mind unequalled ; yet her private character was tarnished by cruelty, hypocrisy, and an insatiable desire of admiration. Her maxims of govern ment were despotic, and she had little regard for the liberties of her people, or the privileges of her parliaments, to whom she never allowed the liberty of disputing her commands. The actual government of England in those days was little different from an absolute monarchy. LVL HISTORY OF GREAT BRITAIN IN THE REIGNS OF JAMES I. AND CHARLES I. 1. James VI. of Scotland succeeded by here ditary right to the throne of England, thus uniting the two crowns ; a prince of considerable learning and talents, but of little vigour of mind z 4"], [362, "344 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. or political energy. He became unpopular from his notions of an uncontrollable prerogative, to which unwisely proclaiming his title, he pro voked his subjects to question it. The current of public opinion was now strongly turned to an extension of the rights of the subject, and retrenchment of the powers of the crown ; and during this reign the seeds were sown of that spirit of resistance on the part of the people, which was destined in the next to overturn the constitution. 2. Domestic events were such as chiefly dis tinguished the reign of James I. A conspi racy was discovered in 1603 for subverting the government, and placing the King's cousin, Arabella Stuart, on the throne, in which the Lords Cobham and Grey and Sir Walter Raw leigh were principally concerned. The two former were pardoned, and Rawleigh con demned, but reprieved ; when, on the ground of his infringement of the peace with Spain, by unwarrantably attacking one of her American settlements, he was, after an interval of fifteen years, beheaded on his former sentence. 3. Another conspiracy followed of a still more dangerous nature, the gunpowder treason ; a plot of the catholics to destroy at one blow the"], [363, "SECT. 56. MODERN HISTORY. 345 King and the whole body of the parliament, 1604. It was discovered, from a circumstance of private friendship, on the very eve of its accomplish ment ; and the principal conspirators suffered a capital punishment. The public indignation now raged against the Catholics ; and the hu manity of James, which sought to mitigate this fury, was as ungenerously as absurdly construed into a favour which he entertained for their re ligious principles. 4. It was a peculiar weakness of the King to attach himself to undeserving favourites. Such was Carre, Earl of Somerset, who had no other re commendation than a handsome person, and who, after several years' exercise of all the insolence of power, fell into disgrace, on conviction of his concern in an infamous murder. His place was supplied by Villiers, afterwards Duke of Buck ingham, [the first subject unconnected with the royal family ever raised to that dignity,] a man devoid of every talent of a minister, and odious to all ranks of the state. He planned a journey of Charles Prince of Wales into Spain to court the Infanta, and by his folly and insolence frus trated the treaty on the brink of its conclusion. 5. Elizabeth, the daughter of James, was married to the Protestant Elector Palatine, who"], [364, "346 MODERN HISTORY, PART II. was dispossessed of his electorate by the Em peror Ferdinand II. for imprudently accepting the crown of Bohemia, till then an appanage of the empire. James was urged by Parliament to a war in defence of his son-in-law, which touched the nation both as a point of honour, and as the cause of the Protestant interest. He [gave some money, and] sent a feeble armament, which was of no service ; the only military en terprise of his reign. His favourite project was a complete union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland ; a measure which, however be neficial, the mutual prejudices of the two nations were as yet too violent to bear. As a prepar atory step, the] Episcopal hierarchy was intro duced into Scotland ; but this served only as the food of future commotions. James I. died, 1625, in the 59th year of his age, and 22d of his reign over England. 6. On an impartial estimate of the character of the succeeding monarch, Charles I., it may be allowed, that had the nation in his reign enter tained the same ideas of the regal prerogative, of the powers of parliament, and of the liberty of the subject, that had prevailed for the two pre ceding centuries, this unfortunate Prince would have reigned with high popularity. But it was"], [365, "SECT. 56. MODERN HISTORY. 347 his lot to mount the throne at that critical period when the public opinion had undergone an en tire revolution on those topics ; and, with many excellent endowments, both of head and heart, he wanted that political prudence which should have taught him to yield to the necessity of the times. 7. Charles quarrelled with his first parliament on their refusal of adequate supplies for the war in support of his brother-in-law the Elector Pa latine. [He demanded the money as a tribute due to him ; the Commons had learned to resist such claims, and to contribute to the public exi gencies in the way only of a free gift, and not without consideration of such grievances as they wished to have redressed.] Engaged to his al lies, the King, dissolving the parliament, issued warrants for borrowing money of the subject. A new parliament was found equally uncomply ing, and evinced its jealousy of the King by the impeachment of his minister, Buckingham ; [whose pride and power were every day be coming more offensive ;] Charles avenging the insult by imprisoning two members of the House of Commons. A quarrel thus begun received continual addition from new causes of offence. The levying money from the subject was en-"], [366, "348 MODERN HISTORY. PART 11. forced by billeting soldiers on those who refused to lend to the crown ; and some were even im prisoned on that account. A war was under taken against France by Buckingham's insti gation, a sufficient cause of its unpopularity ; and it ended in a fruitless attempt on Rochelle. The King again dissolved his parliament, 1626. 8. A new parliament exhibited a spirit of de termined reformation. A Petition of Right was passed by both Houses, which declared the il legality of raising money without their sanction, or enforcing loans from the subject, annulled all taxes imposed without consent of parliament, and abolished the exercise of the martial law ; and Charles was obliged, with much reluctance, to give his assent to this great retrenchment of prerogatives sanctioned by the usage of the most popular of his predecessors. 9. The taxes of tonnage and poundage had usually been continued from one reign to another. On this ground the King conceived he was war ranted to levy them without a new grant ; and a member of the House of Commons was im prisoned on refusal to pay them. This arbitrary measure excited an outrageous ferment in that assembly, and the consequence was a new dis solution of the parliament, 1629."], [367, "SECT. 56. MODERN HISTORY. 349 10. It was now a measure of necessity to make peace with France and Spain. The King persevered in levying the tonnage, poundage, and ship-money, and high fines were imposed for various offences, without trial, by authority of the Star-chamber. The legality of the tax of ship-money was disputed by John Hampden ; but he was condemned by the Court of Ex chequer, contrary, as was generally thought, to justice and the laws of the realm. 11. These discontents were increased by re ligious enthusiasm. Charles, by the advice of Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, had relaxed the penalties against Catholics, and countenanced some innovations in the ceremonials of church worship, preludes, as they were termed, to the Popish idolatries. He had likewise imprudently attempted to introduce the liturgy of the church of England among the Scots ; measures which excited in the latter country the most general discontent, and produced the most violent com motions. A bond, termed the National Covenant, containing an oath of resistance to all religious innovations, was subscribed in Scotland by all ranks and conditions ; and in a General As sembly at Glasgow, the Episcopal hierarchy was solemnly abolished, 1638. To maintain"], [368, "350 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. this violent procedure, the Scots reformers took up arms ; and, after seizing and fortifying the most important places of strength in the king dom, boldly marched into the heart of England. 12. It was now absolutely necessary to as semble a parliament; and the King at length saw that the torrent was irresistible, and re solved, though too late, to give it way. [All the rights which the King, in imitation of his father, and through an ignorance of the true spirit of the English constitution, had arrogated to himself, were denounced as usurpations ;] a bill passed for abolishing the tonnage and poundage without consent of parliament, and received the royal assent. Monopolies of every kind were abolished. A parliament was agreed to be summoned every third year. Unsatisfied with these concessions, the Commons impeached the Earl of Stratford, the King's first minister, of high treason, together with Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who were charged, as the chief counsellors of the crown, with a design of sub verting the laws and constitution of the realm. The fate of Stratford, whose trial by his peers would have terminated in his acquittal, was secured by a bill of attainder, to which the King was, with the greatest reluctance, forced to give"], [369, "SECT. 56. MODERN HISTORY. 351 his assent. The Commons seized that moment of anguish to obtain his consent to a decisive measure, a bill which rendered the parliament perpetual, by declaring that it should not be dissolved or adjourned but by its own decree, 1641. Straffbrd and Laud were both beheaded. 13. This last measure of the Commons evinced a determined purpose to overturn the constitu tion. Their proceedings hitherto had the show of justice, and most of them might be vindicated on the principles of true patriotism. But from this period their conduct was treason to their country and its government. \u2014 The last bill de stroyed the equal balance of the constitution of England, and every subsequent measure was a step towards its entire annihilation. 14. The Irish Catholics took advantage of these disorders, and, with the purpose of assum ing the entire command of that kingdom, and shaking off its dependence on England, at tempted, in one day, to massacre all the Pro testants in Ireland ; [a very great number, as many as forty thousand, it has been said, actually suffered.] To extinguish this horrible rebellion, Charles consigned to the parliament the charge of the war, which they interpreted into a trans ference to them of the whole military powers of"], [370, "352 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. the crown. Under this authority a great force was levied, and supplied with arms from the royal magazines. 15. The bishops having complained that their lives were in danger from the populace, withdrew from parliament, and protesting against the pro ceedings of the Lords in their absence, were impeached of treason by the Commons, and [twelve of them] committed to the Tower. The patience of Charles was exhausted. He caused to be impeached five of the Commons, and went in person to the house to seize them ; a breach of the privilege of parliament, for which he found it necessary to atone by a humiliating message. 16. A new bill of the Commons, naming the commanders of all the fortified places, who should be responsible to parliament alone, was understood to be a declaration of war, [for it was a direct invasion of the royal prerogative.] The next step was to assume the whole legis lative power, by declaring it a breach of privilege to dispute the law of the land declared by the Lords and Commons. But the former were mere name, being entirely under the control of the latter."], [371, "SECT. 56. MODERN HISTORY. 353 17. The sword was now to decide the contest. The royal cause was supported by a great pro portion of the landed interest, all the friends of the established church, and all the Catholics in the kingdom. [The Queen, with great activity and singular resolution, procured some succours from abroad ; not from France, indeed, but Holland, where her daughter was married to the Prince of Orange. Prince Rupert, brother to the unfortunate Elector Palatine, who had married the King's sister, was placed at the head of the royal army.] On the side of the parlia ment were the city of London and most of the greater towns, with all the dissenters and sec taries. The first campaign was favourable to the royalists. They defeated the parliamentary forces at Worcester and Edgehill, but lost the battle of Newbury. 18. The parliament now entered into a strict confederacy with the Scots, both in the articles of politics and religion ; and the Solemn League and Covenant, a new bond, more specific in its objects than the former, and more treasonable in its purpose, was framed at Edinburgh, for the purification of both churches, the reformation of both kingdoms, the maintenance of the privileges of King and parliament, and the bringing to VOL.

Oliver Cromwell commanded at this time a regiment of horse under Fairfax, General of the parliament, but in reality directed all the measures of the army. [It was the younger Fairfax whom he had managed to get appointed, after the removal of the members of both Houses from the army, in virtue of the self-denying ordinance, whereby both peers and commoners were made to renounce all civil and military em ployments, leaving the field open to Cromwell's ambition, who possessed a perfect ascendancy over the new General.] In Scotland the royal cause was gallantly sustained by the Marquis of Montrose ; but all was lost in England by the defeat at Naseby, 1645. The King's troops being entirely dispersed, he threw himself into the hands of the Scots, who basely delivered him up to the commissioners of parliament, from whom he was taken by Cromwell's orders, and conducted to the army, now the masters of the kingdom. Cromwell, entering London, assumed an absolute control over the parliament, and im prisoned all who disputed his authority. Charles, escaping from his confinement, fled to the Isle"], [373, "SECT. 56. 355 MODERN HISTORY. of Wight, but was there detained a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle. 20. The parliament, suffering under this mili tary usurpation, were now sincerely desirous of terminating a miserable anarchy by a treaty with the King, and, after a long negociation, all terms were finally adjusted. Charles agreed to resign to parliament the military power, the disposal of all the offices of state, and the right of creating peers without their consent : he agreed to abolish the Episcopal hierarchy, and to establish the Presbyterian discipline ; and these concessions the parliament accepted by a majority of suf frages, and declared to be a sufficient basis for the settlement of the kingdom. Cromwell in stantly surrounded the House of Commons, and, excluding all but his own partisans (about sixty in number), a second vote was passed, rescind ing the former, and declaring it treason in a King to levy war against his parliament. A court of justice was then appointed to try the King for this act of treason. The House of Lords having unanimously rejected this decree, were immediately voted, by this junto of in dependents, to be a useless branch of the con stitution. A a 2"], [374, "356 MODERN HISTORY.

But from the period that this end was attained, resistance ceased to be lawful. Its farther operations were criminal in the extreme. The subsequent usurp ations of the Commons can no more be justified on any constitutional principle, than the murder of the King can be defended on the score of legality, justice, or humanity."], [375, "SECT. 57. MODERN HISTORY. 357 LVII. THE COMMONWEALTH OF ENGLAND. 1. The parliament of Scotland had taken no part in these latter scenes, and had formally protested against the trial of the King. On his death they proclaimed Charles II. their Sove- reign, but on the express condition of his sign- ing the Covenant, and ratifying their Confession of Faith. Ireland recognised him without any conditions. The heroic Marquis of Montrose landed in the north of Scotland with a few fo- reign troops, and attempted to reduce the party of the Covenanters, and establish the legal au- thority of the King, independent of the servile restrictions with which they had fettered it ; but, attacked by a much superior force, he was de- feated, and betrayed into the hands of his ene- mies, who put him to death by the hands of the executioner, 1650; displaying in the circum stances of his punishment all the insolence of cruelty which distinguishes revenge in the meanest of souls. Charles betook himself to A a 3"], [376, "358 Modern history. part II. Scotland, and was obliged, however reluctantly, to acquiesce in all the terms that were imposed on him. 2. Cromwell, [who had at first been ap pointed Governor of Ireland, but on the refusal of Fairfax to proceed against the Scotch, recalled,] marched, with 16,000 men, into Scotland against the now royalist Covenanters, whom he defeated in the battle of Dunbar; [becoming, thereby, master of Edinburgh ;] and then following the royal army, which retreated into England, he cut them to pieces in the de cisive battle of Worcester, September 3. 1651. Charles fled in disguise through the western and southern counties till he found an opportunity of escaping to France. Cromwell returned in triumph to London. 3. The republican parliament formed and executed great designs. A war with Holland was most ably maintained on both sides by those great naval commanders, Blake, Van Tromp, and De Ruyter ; but the advantage was greatly in favour of the English, who took above 1600 of the Dutch ships. The parliament, proud of these successes, justly conceived that while the nation, was thus powerful at sea, the land-army was an unnecessary burden, and de-"], [377, "SECT. 57. MODERN HISTORY. 359 termined to reduce it. To prevent this measure, Cromwell framed a remonstrance of the army, demanding the election of a new parliament ; and this meeting with no regard, he entered the House of Commons, which he had surrounded with his troops, and, declaring the parliament dissolved by his authority, forcibly turned the members out of doors. The republic of Eng land, which had subsisted four years and three months, was thus annihilated, in one moment, April 20. 1653. 4. It was necessary, however, that there should be the appearance of a parliament. A few mean persons, [about a hundred and forty,] of fanatical character, were chosen by Cromwell's partisans, from the different counties of England, with five from Scotland, and six from Ireland, to hold their functions for fifteen months. This assembly, termed Barebone's Parliament, from its leading member, a leather-seller, became the scorn of the public, and was dissolved by its own vote, after five months. 5. The government was now vested in the Council of Officers, who nominated Oliver Crom well Lord Protector of the three kingdoms, in vested him with the power of making peace, a a 4"], [378, "360 modern History. part II. war, and alliance, and authorised a standing army of 30,000 men to be kept up for the sup port of government. [He was formally invested with the protectorship December, 1653, at the royal Palace of Whitehall, where he took up his residence.] His administration was despotic, vigorous, and spirited. He maintained the ho nour of the nation in the war with the Dutch, compelling them to yield the honour of the flag, and to compensate to the India Company all its losses. [His Navigation Act alone was a measure of consummate policy, calculated greatly to in crease the commerce of the nation, to encourage seamen, to advance the knowledge of maritime affairs, and naval skill, and to give consequence to the state.] He was successful, likewise, in his negotiations with France and Spain. [All the foreign powers seemed to vie with each other in paying court to him.] But in his domestic government he was traversed by his parliaments, whom it cost him a continual struggle, and even violence, to keep in order. One parliament, properly prepared, voted him the regal title, which, by the counsel of his best friends, he was forced most unwillingly to refuse. In recom pense of this self-denial, the parliament con-"], [379, "SECT. 57. MODERN HISTORY. 361 firmed his title of Protector, with a fixed revenue, and decreed his right of appointing a successor. He was King in all but the name; [leading, however, rather a gloomy life in the late abodes of royalty, without pomp or luxury.] 6. By consent of parliament, Cromwell ap pointed a House of Lords ; but all the ancient Peers declined the proffered honour. He was forced to choose them from the Commons ; and thus he lost the majority in the Lower House. His temper soured with disappointment, a prey to chagrin, and in continual fear of assassination, he fell at length into a mortal disease, and died in the 59th year of his age, 3d September, 1658. [He was buried with great pomp, but no real sorrow. An eye-witness of great respectability has re corded, that it was \" the joyfullest funeral he ever saw.\"] 7. Richard Cromwell, son of Oliver, suc ceeded, however, by his father's appointment, to the Protectorate; a man of weak under standing and facile temper, utterly unfit for his hazardous situation, which accordingly he maintained only for a few months, resigning his office on the 22d April, 1659. His brother Henry, Viceroy of Ireland, immediately sol-"], [380, "362 MODERN HISTORY. PART II lowed his example ; and the family of the Crom wells, which the talents of one man had ele vated above the sovereigns of their country, re turned once more to its original obscurity. 8. The remains of that nominal parliament which had put the King to death, termed, in derision, the Rump, was now dissolved by the Council of Officers. Of these, every aspiring individual had his own separate views of am- bition. Intrigue, cabal, and anarchy, were uni- versal ; and the nation, looking forward with horror to a series of calamities, began earnestly to desire the restitution of its ancient govern- ment. George Monk, commander of the army in Scotland, [supported by Fairfax, who now came forward again, in a better cause,] judging these symptoms favourable for restoring the exiled monarch to the throne of his ancestors, marched his army into England, declaring his resolution to be, to bring about the election of a free parliament, which all men knew to be synonymous with the restoration of the King. It was of course violently opposed by the republican party, who even attempted to excite a new civil war ; but they were forced at length to ac quiesce in the measure. A free parliament was"], [381, "SECT. 58.

LVIII. THE REIGNS OF CHARLES II. AND JAMES II. 1. The nation, without imposing any terms on their new sovereign, trusted implicitly to his good dispositions. These were humane and complacent ; but the character of Charles, indo lent, luxurious, and prodigal, was neither fitted to support the national honour abroad, nor to command obedience and respect to his domestic government. The sale of Dunkirk, [so recently obtained from France by Cromwell, as the price of his assistance against Spain,] was a measure offensive to the pride of the nation. A war with Holland, supported at a vast expense, and main tained in many desperate but indecisive engage ments, was attended finally with no material benefit ; [and in one instance, indeed, with no"], [382, "364 MODERN HISTORY.

The sale of Dunkirk, and the unsuccessful issue of the war, attributed to the counsel of the Earl of Clarendon, procured the disgrace and banishment of that illustrious man, I667. The peace was scarcely concluded with Holland, when England joined with her and Sweden in a triple alliance, to oppose the progress of the arms of Lewis XIV. in the Low Countries ; and that object being attained, by the treaty of Aix la-Chapelle in 1668, the French monarch gained the English over to his interest, in a new war against the Dutch, which brought their republic to the brink of destruction. 3. The domestic administration of Charles was embroiled from various causes, originating in the personal character and dispositions of the sovereign. He trusted to profligate and worth less counsellors. His arbitrary notions of go vernment, and the partiality he showed to the Catholics, gave perpetual alarm and uneasiness to a great proportion of his subjects. Com-"], [383, "SECT. 58. MODERN HISTORY. 365 plaints resounded from every quarter ; and the parliament required a test-oath, abjuring Po pery, from all persons in public employment. On refusal to take this oath, the King's brother, James Duke of York, was deprived of his office of High Admiral. 4. Titus Oates, a worthless impostor, pre tended to have discovered a plot of the Catholics for assassinating the King, burning London, massacring the Protestants, and placing the Duke of York on the throne. Another villain, named Bedloe, joined his evidence to that of Oates ; and on their perjured testimony, afterwards fully exposed, a few miserable priests suffered death. A new test was imposed, which excluded all Papists from both Houses of Parliament. The treasurer Danby was impeached for advising the last peace with France, though it was proved that he had acted by his sovereign's orders ; and a bill passed the House of Commons, ex cluding the Duke of York from the succession to the crown. A more important bill for the general liberty, the act of Habeas Corpus, was the work of the same session of parliament. (See Sect. LIX. \u00a7 14.) 5. The distinguishing epithets of Whig and Tory were now first known ; the former, the"], [384, "366 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. opposers of the crown, against the latter, its partisans ; and each party, as in all factions, carried its principles to an extreme. The Whigs, predominant in the next parliament, raged with fury against the Catholics, and insisted on the King's assent to the bill for the exclusion of his brother. He had no other expedient but to dis solve them, but found their successors equally violent. Aster various fruitless attempts to con ciliate their favour to his measures, a dissolution ensued of this parliament, the last which Charles assembled. 6. But the great cause of dissatisfaction remained. The Duke of York was at the bot tom of all the measures of government. A conspiracy was formed by Shaftesbury, Russel, Sidney, and the Duke of Monmouth, natural son of the King, on the pretence of vindicating the national liberties. It was discovered by one of the associates, and Russel and Sidney suffered a capital punishment. The detection of this conspiracy strengthened the authority of the Sovereign. The Duke of York was restored to his office of High Admiral, and tacitly acknow ledged as the successor to the crown. Charles II. died 6th February, 1685, in the 55th year of his age, and 25th year of his reign."], [385, "SECT. 58. 367 MODERN HISTORY. 7. The Duke of York succeeded to the throne by the title of James II. His reign was short and inglorious. He was the instrument of his own misfortunes, and ran headlong to destruc tion. The Catholics at this time were not the hundredth part of the nation, yet James, [in close connection with the Jesuits,] was weak enough to make the desperate attempt of sub stituting the Popish faith in room of the Protestant. Discarding the nobility from his councils, he was directed solely by Romish priests ; and in the very outset of his reign ex pressed his contempt of the authority of parlia ment, and a firm purpose to exercise an unlimited despotism. 8. The Duke of Monmouth, having excited a new rebellion, was defeated, made prisoner, and beheaded ; and the most inhuman rigour was shown in the punishment of all his partisans. The parliament was in general submissive to the King's will, which for a while met with no op position or control. A declaration was published, establishing full liberty of conscience in matters of religion ; and several bishops, who refused to publish it in their dioceses, were committed to prison. A Catholic president was appointed to one of the colleges of Oxford. An ambassador"], [386, "368 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. was sent to the Pope, and a papal nuncio re ceived in London. The Catholics openly boasted that theirs would soon be the religion of the state. 9. James had three children : Mary, the wife of the Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange ; Anne, married to Prince George of Denmark ; and James, an infant. The Stadtholder had looked on his right to the crown of England as certain before the birth of this infant, and, after that event, projected still to gain it by arms or intrigue ; the infatuation of the King and the general discontent of the people giving him the most flattering invitation. James himself was informed of these views of his son-in-law, but would give them no credit, till actually apprised of his landing with an army, 15th November, 1688. 10. The principal nobility and officers im mediately joined the standard of the Prince of Orange ; and James was at once abandoned by his people, his ministers, his favourites, and his own children. Leaving London in disguise, he was discovered and brought back by the popu lace ; but the Prince of Orange wisely favouring his escape, he found means a few days after to convey himself to France."], [387, "SECT. 58. 369 MODERN HISTORY. 11. The throne being declared vacant, it was proposed in a convention-parliament, that the crown should be settled on the princess Mary and her issue, her husband governing as Regent; whom failing, on the Princess Anne. The Stadt holder declining the office of Regent, it was finally resolved to confer the crown on the Prince and Princess of Orange, the former to have the sole administration of the government. [It was decreed at the same time that no Ca tholic Prince, or husband of a Catholic princess should ever become King of Great Britain or Ireland, but should be considered as dead, and that the title should pass to the next heir.] 12. To this settlement [of the crown] was added a declaration fixing the rights of the sub ject and the royal prerogative. Of this the most important articles are the following : The King cannot suspend the laws or their execution ; he cannot levy money without consent of Parlia- ment: The subjects have right to oetition the Crown : A standing army cannot be kept up in time of peace but by consent of Parliament : Elections and parliamentary debate must be free, and parliaments must be frequently as sembled, &c.

At this period, when the consti tution of the country became fixed and deter mined, we finish .the sketch of the history of our own country. LIX. ON THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION. 1. The rudiments of the constitution of England may be traced as far back as the Norman conquest. William distributed a great proportion of the lands among his Norman fol lowers, subjecting these, as well as the Anglo- Saxons who retained their property, to the feudal tenures, and thus extinguishing at once the ancient liberties of the people. \u2014 England was divided into 60,215 military fiefs, all held of the Crown, under the obligation of the vassal's taking arms for his sovereign whenever required. In the continental kingdoms of Europe, as in France, the feudal system arose by slow degrees, nor was there of consequence the same union of the fabric as in England. The feudal lords were independent of each other, ever at variance from their mutual pretensions, and often owing"], [389, "SECT. 59. MODERN HISTORY. 371 but a very slender allegiance to the Crown. Their vassals suffered from oppression, and often struggled for their freedom ; but these efforts being partial produced no consequence favour able to the liberty of the nation. In England all were oppressed by the enormous weight of the crown ; it was a common grievance, and produced at times a violent effort for the general liberties of the people. 2. The forest-laws imposed by the Conqueror (see Sect XV. \u00a7 2. 11.) were a grievance felt by the whole nation, as rendering every man's property precarious, and subject to the arbitrary encroachments of the Crown. It was no wonder that the barons and their vassals should cordially unite to rid themselves of so intolerable a hard ship. Henry I. found it necessary to conciliate his subjects, by mitigating the most rigorous of the feudal laws. A greater advance was made under Henry II. by the institution of the trial by jury. But John, imprudently resisting this natural progress towards a rational freedom, was soon compelled into those important con cessions, the Charta de Foresta and Magna Charta. From that time, whatever we may judge of the actual government, which was often b b 2"], [390, "372 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. most arbitrary and despotical, the constitution of England was that of a limited monarchy. 3. The next memorable \u00e6ra in the growth of the English constitution was the reign of Henry III., when, under that weak prince, the parliament received a new form, by the admission of the representatives of the people, the deputies of the counties and boroughs. (Sect XXII. \u00a7 2.) His successor Edward I. acknowledged their authority in obtaining all his subsidies, and ratified a new law, which declared, that no tax should be levied without the consent of Lords and Commons. \u2014 The Magna Charta was con firmed no less than eleven times in the course of this reign. 4. Thus the constitution continued advancing, till its progress was suspended by the civil wars of York and Lancaster. The rights of both prince and people seemed then to be entirely forgotten ; and the race of Tudor found no resistance from parliament to their vigorous but despotic sway. The talents of Elizabeth, and the high character which her government sus tained with foreign powers, extinguished all domestic disquiets, while the predominant feel ing was the maintenance of the power and dig nity of the crown."], [391, "SECT. 59- 373 MODERN HISTORY. 5. But under the succeeding prince, when that power and dignity were abased by his own weakness, the nation began to awake from its lethargy ; and that spirit of opposition, which in this reign confined itself to complaints, was in the next to break forth with alarming violence. Charles L, endowed with superior energy of character, and acting, as he conceived, on a principle of duty, which called on him to main tain the prerogative of his predecessors, and transmit it unimpaired to his posterity, was im prudent in exerting with rigour an authority which he wanted ultimate resources to support. He was compelled to sign the Petition of Rights, a grant more favourable to liberty than Magna Charta. The true patriots were satisfied with this concession, which conferred the most ample constitutional freedom. But with the populai leaders patriotism was the cloak of insatiable ambition ; and advancing in their demands with every new compliance, the last appeal was made to the sword, and the contest ended by the destruction of the constitution. 6. The despotism which succeeded, and the fluctuation of power from the Long Parliament to the Protector, and finally to the leaders of a standing army, afforded convincing demonstra- B b 3"], [392, "374 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. tion how vain was the chimera of a republic, under which the demagogues had masked their designs. Weary of anarchy, the nation returned with high satisfaction to the best of all constitu tions, a limited monarchy. 7. New encroachments under Charles II. pro duced new limitations, and the act of Habeas Corpus gave the utmost possible security to per sonal liberty. The violent and frantic invasion of the constitution by James II. banished himself and his posterity from the throne, and produced a new and solemn contract between the King and people. Regarding, therefore, the Revolu tion as the final settlement of the English con stitution, we shall endeavour briefly to delineate the chief features of that great political structure. 8. The constitution of Great Britain may be viewed under two distinct heads, the legislative and the executive power : the last comprehend ing the prerogative of the Crown. The power of legislation belongs to parlia ment, whose constituent parts are, the King, Loids, and Commons. The House of Lords consists of the temporal peers of England, and the spiritual, viz. the two archbishops and twenty-four bishops. To these, since the union with Scotland [and Ireland,] are added sixteen"], [393, "SECT. 59. 375 MODERN HISTORY. delegates from the peerage [of the former king dom, and thirty-two from the latter.] The House of Commons consists of the deputies of the counties and principal towns of England, and the two universities, amounting in all to 513 members ; [to whom, since the unions, are added 45 from Scotland and 100 from Ireland.] These deputies are chosen by the freeholders who pos sess a property yielding a certain yearly rent. The Chancellor generally presides in the House of Lords ; the Speaker is president in the House of Commons. 9. The King is the most essential component part of parliament, because he alone has the power to convoke, prorogue, and dissolve it. He has likewise a negative on all its acts, which are invalid without his approbation ; and each house has a negative on the decrees of the other. It is likewise competent to the King to propose any measure to be laid before the parliament. 10. All questions regarding public affairs and national measures may originate in either house of parliament, except grants of money, which must take their rise in the House of Commons, and cannot be altered, though they may be re jected by the Lords. The matter must be pri marily discussed in that house in which it ori- b b 4"], [394, "376 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. ginates, and, until there decided, cannot be re ceived by the other unless a conference should be demanded. A bill refused by either house, or, though passed by both, refused by the King, is utterly void. 11. The executive power of government is lodged in the King. (1.) The first branch of his office is the administration of justice. The judges of all courts of judicature are the King's substitutes. He is the prosecutor of all crimes, and has the power of pardoning and suspending the. execution of all sentences. (2.) He is the fountain of all honour, the giver of all titles and dignities, and the disposer of all the offices of state. (3.) He is the superintendant of com merce, and has the power of regulating weights and measures, and of coining money. (4.) He is the head of the church, and names the arch bishops and bishops. (5.) He is commander in chief of all the sea and land forces, and can alone equip fleets, levy armies, and appoint all their officers. (6.) He has the power of making war, peace and alliance, and of sending and re ceiving ambassadors. (7.) He is above the reach of all courts of justice, and is not respon sible to any judicature for his conduct in the administration of government."], [395, "SECT. 59. 377 MODERN HISTORY. 12. These high powers of the Sovereign which, at first sight, would seem to render him an absolute monarch, are thus admirably con trolled : \u2014 The King is dependent on parliament for all subsidies, without which he can neither maintain his fleets and armies, nor pay the sa laries of officers. The parliament indeed settles a revenue on the King for life, but this is merely sufficient for the maintenance of his household, and supporting a proper dignity of establishment ; and as it must be renewed by parliament at the beginning of every reign, it is in the power of that body to withhold it till all abuses shall be remedied. Thus the constitu tion may be brought back at those periods to its first principles, and all encroachments of the prerogative restrained. 13. The King can never reign without a par liament. It must by law be assembled once in three years, on a notice of forty days before its meeting. Although the head of the church, the King cannot alter the established reli gion, nor frame ecclesiastical regulations ; these must be made by the assembly of the clergy. The King cannot interfere in the ordinary ad ministration of justice, nor refuse his consent to the prosecution of crimes. He may pardon of fences, but cannot exempt the offender from"], [396, "378 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. pecuniary compensation to the party injured. He cannot alter the standard of money, either in weight or alloy. He cannot raise an army without the consent of parliament ; and, though a mo derate standing force is kept up with their con sent, the funds for its payment require an annual renewal by parliament. Finally, although the Sovereign himself is not amenable to any judicature, his ministers are responsible for all the measures of govern ment, and are impeachable by the Commons at the bar of the House of Lords, for every spe cies of misconduct or misdemeanour. Moreover, the freedom of parliamentary dis cussion is secured, as no member can be ques tioned for any opinions or words, but in that house of parliament in which they were uttered. 14. The personal security and the rights of the subjects are farther guarded by these three peculiarties of the British constitution, the Ha beas Corpus, Trial by Juries, and the Liberty of the Press. By the act of Habeas Corpus every prisoner must be brought before a judge, the cause of his detainer certified, and the judged authority interposed to it. The violation of this statute is punishable by the highest pe nalties. The Habeas Corpus may be suspended"], [397, "SECT. 59. 379 MODERN HISTORY. in times of danger to the state, as during the ex istence of a conspiracy or rebellion. Although this act does not extend to Scotland, the sub jects of that part of the United Kingdom are equally secured by their own laws. * 15. All crimes must be tried by a jury of twelve men in England and Ireland, and fif teen in Scotland. The prisoner has a right of challenging or objecting to the jurors ; and (ex cept in Scotland) without showing any cause he may challenge twenty successively in ordinary cases, and thirty-five in cases of treason. The jury are judges both of the law and the fact ; nor has the opinion of the Court any weight in their decision, but such as they choose to give it 16. The liberty of the press is in this respect a guardian of the constitution, that it is com petent for any individual to convey to the public his opinion of the whole conduct of government, and the merits of its conductors ; to canvass every counsel of state, and examine every public measure ; thus forcibly restraining all ministers and magistrates within the limits of their duty. It is farther the guardian of injured innocence, * Statute 1701, c.6."], [398, "380 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. and the redresser of all wrongs tnat evade the cognisance of law. Yet this most valuable right, if itself unrestrained, would be the source of the greatest mischief. If it were allowable with impunity to assail the established govern ment, to convulse society, to disseminate atheism, to injure the reputation or endanger the life and property of individuals by false accusations, there would be an end of all liberty and civil happiness. The liberty of the press consists in this, that there is no examination of writings previous to their being printed and published ; but, after publication, such writings as offend in any of the above particulars, are, on trial of the offence by jury, punishable by law. Thus the public is properly constituted the judge and censor of all writings addressed to itself. 17. Such are briefly the outlines of the ad mirable fabric of the British constitution. Esto per pet ua !"], [399, "SECT. 60. MODERN HISTORY. 381 LX. OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE OF GREAT BRITAIN. 1. The property belonging to the Crown of of Great Britain, which was anciently very great, and fully adequate to the maintenance of government, consisted of domain-lands, the first fruits and tenths of church-benefices, the rents of vacant bishoprics and abbeys, the profits of mili tary tenures, fines imposed in courts of justice, forfeitures, &c. These are now from alien ations made by the sovereigns, and retrench ments of their prerogative, become so incon siderable, that the King may be considered as entirely dependent on the people for the support of his dignity, and the means of car rying on the business of the state. The pub lic revenue, destined both for the former and latter purpose, arises now from the subsidies granted by the people ; the supplies are voted by the Commons ; and the means of furn nishing them, by taxes proposed by the Chan-"], [400, "382 MODERN HISTORY. PART II cellor of the Exchequer, must receive their sanction. 2. Of these taxes, some are annual, [that is, subject to a yearly renewal by parliament,] as the land-tax and malt-tax ; and others [unless repealed or modified,] perpetual as the cus toms, excise, salt-duty, post-office duty, stamps, house and window-tax, duties on servants, hack ney-coaches, pensions, &c. The customs are a tax paid by the merchant on all imported and exported commodities ; the excise, an in land imposition, laid sometimes on the con sumer, and sometimes on the retail-seller. 3. The produce of these taxes is, in the first place, destined to the paying the interest of the national debt, and afterwards to the ordinary support of government. The national debt arose soon after the Revo lution, when it was thought hazardous to im pose annual taxes equal to the annual expense of government, and more expedient to borrow large sums for the immediate service of the state, raising annually no more than to pay the interest of that debt. The same system has been since persevered in ; so that the national debt, which a century ago was 16 millions, is"], [401, "SECT. 60. MODERN HISTORY. 383 now above 300 millions. * To pay the interest of this enormous sum, the produce of the taxes (excepting the malt and land-tax) are primarily destined j and, as somewhat more is annually raised than that exigence and the maintenance of government demand, the surplus constitutes a sinking fund for paying off the principal of the debt. 4. The produce of the taxes, originally se parate funds, is now thrown into two or three capital funds, one of which is mortgaged by parliament for the maintenance of the King's household and the civil-list, viz. the salaries of officers of state, judges, ambassadors, private ex penses, pensions, &c. 5. Notwithstanding the little prospect of an extinction of the national debt, government maintains its credit, and will always find lenders, because the terms granted are beneficial, and the security is transferable ; so that a lender can thus always obtain payment of his principal sum, and frequently make gain by the transference. The value of stock rises and falls from various oc casional causes, as national prosperity, or the re verse, plenty or scarcity of money, quantity of pub- * [Very greatly increased since.]"], [402, "384 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. lie debt. On this variation is founded the practice of stock-jobbing ; that is, either buying and selling actual property in the public funds, which is a lawful speculation, or gaming and wagering on the price of stock, which is an il- licit though common practice. The practice of stock-jobbing, even by the transference of actual property, far more by gaming on that which is fic- titious, is prejudicial to commerce and manufac- tures, by engrossing a great part of the national wealth, repressing industry, encouraging fraud, and often tempting to the most treacherous and dangerous devices for raising and sinking the funds. [It cannot, however, now be prac- tised to the extent it formerly was, the stocks being by many regulations regarding the sink ing-fund, secured from such fluctuations, as were formerly the chief temptations to that species of gambling.]"], [403, "SECT. 61. 385 MODERN HISTORY. LXI. HISTORY OF FRANCE UNDER LEWIS XIII. 1. France, which under Henry IV. had risen from a state of miserable anarchy to high prosperity and splendour, sunk, immediately upon his death, into weakness, faction, and dis order. Mary of Medici, [appointed not by the states-general as should have been the case, but by the Parliament at the instance of the Duke d'Epernon,] Regent in the minority of her son Lewis XIIL, a weak woman, and of restless am bition, disgusted the nobility by her partiality for her Italian courtiers. Concini, her first minister, [though ignorant of the laws, manners, and interests of the kingdom,] created Marshal d'Ancre, [without the smallest military pre tensions,] became so universally odious, that he was [with the privity of the young King] openly murdered in the Louvre, and his body torn to pieces ; [his wife being, if possible, still more cruelly treated.] The Queen [-mother, her guards being previously removed and dis armed,] was exiled from Paris, and kept for two* vol. u. c c"], [404, "386 MODERN history. PART II. years a prisoner at Blois, till relieved by the Duke d'Epernon, to serve his own purposes of ambition. The Queen's party was at war with that of her son, and the whole kingdom in a state of anarchy. 2. The genius of Cardinal Richelieu, [first noticed by the Concini, and a sharer in their disgrace, but] who was now brought into power by Mary of Medici, soon effected a wonderful change. He reconciled the mother and her son, soothed the contending factions, and, on the King's assuming the government, directed every public measure to the complete re-establishment of the power and dignity of the monarchy. The party of the Calvinists, alienated by per secution, [and having several great lords on their side,] attempted to throw off their allegi ance, and establish an independent state, of which Rochelle should be the capital. Riche lieu bargained with the Dutch to furnish a fleet for subduing their Protestant brethren, and the Dutch now fought as keenly for the Catholic religion as they had lately done for the Pro testant. The English sent a fleet to the aid of the Rochellois, who for a year maintained, [with astonishing firmness and undaunted resolution,] a most obstinate siege against the French troops commanded by the Cardinal in person; [the"], [405, "SECT. 61. 387 MODERN HISTORY. King himself being also often present, and by no means inactive in forwarding the assault.] They were at length forced to surrender, [chiefly through famine,] and Rochelle, with all the other Protestant cities of France, were stripped of all such privileges [as might be dangerous to the state,] and had their fortifications destroyed. Thus Calvinism was for ever crushed in France, [though not extirpated ; for they were still allowed liberty of conscience, and to have their temples, municipal laws, and courts of justice, as a tolerated sect.] 3. Lewis XIIL, though a weak Prince, saw his advantage in entering into all the great designs of his minister. Richelieu influenced the politics of all Europe. [He had three grand objects constantly before his eyes : to reduce the exorbitant power of the princes and nobles ; to keep the reformed party quiet ; and to prevent the too great aggrandisement of the house of Austria.] The power of Austria was attacked in Germany, Flanders, Spain, and Italy ; and the talents of the minister were equally displayed in active war, in foreign negociation, and in his domestic arrangements. Yet at this very time a formidable cabal was undermining him. Mary of Medici was jealous of the man she had raised, c c 2"], [406, "388 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. and Gaston, Duke of Orleans, the King's brother, sought to supplant him in his power. Richelieu, [though dismissed by the King, and, to all ap pearance, nearly falling a sacrifice,] with as tonishing intrepidity of mind repressed this conspiracy. Fortified by the King's authority, [whose favor he found means to recover at the most critical moment,] he seized the Marshal de Marillac, one of his most dangerous enemies, at the head of his army, and tried and put him to death by a lawless stretch of power. Orleans, apprehensive of a similar fate, fled the kingdom ; [protesting that he would never return, while so great an enemy to himself and his mother was permitted to enjoy such power;] and Mary of Medici, arrested and removed from court, [and who never afterwards saw her son,] ended her career of ambition in voluntary exile at Brussels ; [and in wretched circumstances.] Orleans, supported by the Duke de Montmo renci, attempted a rebellion ; but their army was defeated, and Montmorenci, [who, but a short time before, had received extraordinary thanks from his sovereign for defeating his enemies, Imperialists, Spaniards, and Savoyards, on the plains of Vegliane,] executed for treason. The Queen had taken part with the enemies of the Cardinal. He imprisoned her confessor, seized"], [407, "SECT. 61. MODERN HISTORY. 389 and examined her papers ; and Anne of Austria was very near sharing the fate of Mary of Medici. The only motive of this extraordinary enmity to both Queens being probably the fear and apprehension he entertained of their ob taining too great an influence with the King, the son and the husband.] 4. Amidst all this turbulence both of foreign war and state cabal, Richelieu, [whose love of glory was general and insatiable,] cultivated the pursuits of literature, encouraged the sciences, instituted the French Academy, and composed pieces for the theatre. The administration of Richelieu, though turbulent from faction and civil war, was, on the whole, extremely glorious for France. [His whole plan, with a view to the political or exterior interests of the kingdom he ruled, was from the first grand and magnificent ;] and the seeds were [by him unquestionably] sown of the splendour of that monarchy in the succeeding age of Lewis XIV. [Intact, thewhole of Europe was included in the very first projects of his administration ; and to repress the threaten ing preponderance of Germany, he wisely turned to the almost unknown northern powers for assistance, overlooking the difference of reli gion, and thereby produced a balance never to c c 3"], [408, "390 MODERN HISTORY.

CON- STITUTION OF PORTUGAL AND OF SPAIN. 1. From the death of Philip II. Spain de clined in power, and notwithstanding her great sources of wealth, the national finances were in the utmost disorder. Philip III. was forced to conclude a peace with the Dutch, [who had stripped him of some of his most valuable settle ments, being more than his match at sea,] and to restore to the house of Nassau its confiscated estates. With a weak and despicable policy, he expelled from his kingdom all the Moors, who were the most industrious of its inhabitants, 1610 ; and this depopulation, joined to that al ready produced by her American colonies, ren dered Spain a lifeless and enervated mass. 2. The national weakness and its disorders"], [409, "SECT. 62. 391 MODERN HISTORY. increased under Philip IV., who, equally spirit less as his father, was implicitly ruled by his mi nister Olivarez, as Philip III. had been by the Duke of Lerma. His reign, [in addition to the grossest mismanagement in regard to all things appertaining to the internal wealth and pros perity of the kingdom,] was one continual series of miscarriages and defeats. The Dutch seized Brazil ; the French, [aster driving the Spaniards out of Piedmont,] invaded Artois ; Catalonia revolted to France ; and Portugal shook off its yoke, and became an independent kingdom. 3. No revolution was ever effected with such ease and celerity as that of Portugal. The people were disgusted with the rigorous and im- politic administration of Olivarez. The Duke of Braganza, descended from the ancient kings of Portugal, had at this time the command of the army. Instigated by the ambition of his Duchess, and seeing the spirit of the nation favourable to his views, he caused himself to be proclaimed King at Lisbon. The Spanish guards were attacked and routed, and the chief partisans of the government put to death by the populace. All the principal towns followed the example of the capital, and soon after all the foreign settlements; [the Dutch even joining c c 4"], [410, "392 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. the new king, and restoring to him what they had wrested from the Spaniards in Brazil.] From that \u00e6ra, 1640, Portugal became an independent sovereignty, after having been for sixty years an appanage of the kingdom of Spain. 4. The government of Portugal approaches to an absolute monarchy. The consent of the states or Cortes, consisting of Clergy, Nobility, and Commons, was formerly necessary to the im position of taxes, and the settlement of the suc cession to the crown. But this assembly, never convoked but by the royal mandate, has now for a long time ceased to meet. The ordinary busi ness of government is transacted by the King and his council of state, which is appointed by himself. The crown's revenue arises from its do mains, including the family-estates of Braganza, from the duties on exports and imports, from the taxes, and from a stated proportion of the gold brought from Brazil. The state of the commerce and manufactures of Portugal is extremely low ; and, though favoured by soil and climate, the agriculture of the kingdom is much neglected. * * [What has already been said of Spain may with equal truth be applied to Portugal.

MODERN HISTORY. 393 5. The reigns of Philip III. and IV. of Spain, though an \u00e6ra of national humiliation, derived some small lustre from the state of literature. Dramatic compositon, poetry and romance, and even history, were cultivated with great success. But these are in some sort the amusements of indolence, and this was the predominant cha racter of the people. This character may have arisen from two sources : The torrent of wealth poured in from America retarded, in the lower classes, domestic industry and manufactures, while it increased the pride of the gentry, and made them disdain all occupation. [The magnifi cence of the grandees consisted in a profusion of plate, and a great number of domestics : the comforts and conveniencies of life were sadly overlooked; and since the expulsion of the Moors, whose industry had supplied many things useful and agreeable, the whole kingdom exhibited a wretched appearance of dreariness and sloth.] The despotism of the government, indeed, was strongly repressive of all enterpise and activity in the people. [The inland trade was checked, and stifled, as it were, in its birth, by a multipli city of harassing and impolitic duties, which prevented any profitable intercourse between one province and another ; so that what both"], [412, "394 PART II.

The constitution of Spain, of which the so vereignty was in ancient times elective, is now that of an absolute monarchy. The crown is hereditary; though at different times, as in 1619 and 1713, there has been a new limitation made by the monarch of the succession. The Cortes, or states of the kingdom, limited in former times the power of the sovereign, but Charles V. re duced their authority to nothing, by depriving the nobility and clergy of their seat in those as semblies ; the remaining members, the deputies of the towns, being entirely under the control of the monarch.

To preserve the connection of the affairs of Germany with those of the other kingdoms of Europe, we must look back to the period of the abdication of Charles V., when the empire was distracted both by the political factions and quarrels of its independent princes, and the con- tending sects of the Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. Ferdinand attempted to reconcile these factions, and unite the three religions, but in vain. Maximilian II. had still less power to effect this object than his predecessor ; nor was the face of affairs at all changed during the suc- ceeding reigns of Rodolphus II. and Matthias. [The former was Emperor, and King of Bohemia and Hungary, but without influence in either country; and the latter kingdom during his reign had nearly fallen into the hands of the Turks : but he was more of a philosopher than a king, which made him in fact resign most of his regal honors"], [414, "396 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. before his death to his brother Matthias, while Tycho Brahe and Kepler were distinguishing him as a philosopher, by their Rodolphine tables of calculations. His successor Matthias, who had taken his place before his death/at the instigation of those who had ends of their own to answer, found himself awkwardly placed when he came to the imperial throne, between the reformed party, -whom he had favored in Hungary and Bohemia, and the Catholics of his hereditary states : he had no resource but to yield to the demands of both, without having the satisfaction of conciliating either.] A civil war, of thirty years' duration, [beginning 1618, and ending with the treaty of Westphalia, 164S,] reduced the empire to extremity. Under Ferdinand II., [the suc cessor of Matthias, who died 1619,] a zealous Catholic, the Protestant states of Bohemia, who had suffered under the government of Matthias, conferred their crown On the Elector Palatine _ [a prince of the house of Bavaria, but of the Cal vinistic religion.] The Emperor, in revenge, [assisted by the other, or Catholic, branch of the Bavarian family,] deprived him both of his crown and his electorate. [The Elector fled for refuge and assistance to Silesia, Denmark, Holland, England, and France ; but though it was the in-"], [415, "SECT. 63. MODERN HISTORY. 397 terest of the latter power to prevent the Em peror becoming too powerful, and of James the First of England, his father-in-law, to support the Protestant party, he obtained no effectual aid.] 2. The Protestant cause was [thus to all ap- pearance] declining fast in Germany, and every thing seemed to indicate success to the schemes of Ferdinand for its entire annihilation, when it received new [and unexpected] vigour from the intervention of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, [with whose affairs Ferdinand had im- prudently interfered.] This great Prince de- feated the [most celebrated] Imperial Generals, [particularly Tilly,] and carried the Protestant banners, [in a most extraordinary manner,] trium- phantly through Germany. [He triumphed not only by the force of his arms, but by the grandeur of his character: just, humane, and moderate; where others (particularly the ferocious Wal- stein) had violated every right, and acted in open and avowed contempt of every amiable feeling, Gustavus won the hearts even of those who were opposed to him, and astonished a distracted world, by a display of heroic virtue little ex- pected to be found in the person of a Scandina vian soldier.] The Emperor was completely"], [416, "398 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. humbled, and the Elector Palatine on the eve of restoration to his dominions, when the heroic Gustavus was slain in the battle ofLutzen, 1632. The war was successfully prosecuted by the Swedish Generals, while Cardinal Richelieu harassed the house of Austria both in Germany and Spain. [Ferdinand II., who had spent his whole reign in the midst of war, without ever taking upon him any command, or engaging per sonally in the contests, which he provoked or promoted, died, as it has been said, of mortifi cation and chagrin, at the age of fifty-nine, 1637.] 3. In the succeeding reign of Ferdinand III. the Protestants of Germany found the most ac tive support both from the Swedes and the French ; and the Emperor being forced to con clude the peace of Westphalia, 1648, these powers dictated its terms. By this celebrated treaty all disputes were settled between the con tending princes of the empire and the contending religions. The Swedes, [who assumed a high tone in consequence of their victories, and, as it has been well remarked, negotiated through their minister, Salvius, as Gustavus had fought,] were indemnified for the charges of the war, and ac-"], [417, "SECT. 64. 399 MODERN HISTORY. quired Pomerania, Stettin, Wisraar, &c, and their sovereign the dignity of Prince of the em pire ; the Palatine family was restored to its chief possessions ; the King of France made Landgrave of Alsace ; [an acquisition of great importance ;] and an equal establishment de creed of the three religions. This salutary peace laid the foundation of the future great ness and prosperity of the German empire, [miserably wasted by so long and ruinous a war, and never standing more in need of rest and repose.] LXIV. FRANCE UNDER LEWIS XIV. 1. On the death of Lewis XIIL, 1643, his son Lewis XIV. succeeded to the throne in the fifth year of his age. Europe, as we have seen, was in a most turbulent state ; and France, under the administration of Richelieu, acted a conspicuous part in exciting those general com motions. The Queen-mother, Anne of Austria, appointed Regent by the states, chose for her minister the Cardinal Mazarin, an Italian, and"], [418, "400 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. from that circumstance odious to the people. The Spaniards, taking advantage of the King's minority and the popular discontents, made an attack on Champagne ; but they were defeated in a series of engagements by the great Conde ; and the Marshal de Turenne shared with him the palm of glory. The peace of Westphalia composed these differences. 2. At this very time the commotions of the Fronde broke out in Paris. The jealousy felt by the nobility of Mazarin's power, the unpopu larity of his measures, the disorder of the finances, and the oppression of new taxes, in flamed the nation ; and the intrigues of the coadjutor, afterwards Cardinal de Retz, blew up this flame into a civil war. The parliament of Paris took part with the rebels, who were headed by the Prince of Conti, the Dukes of Longue ville and Bouillon, and the chief nobility. The Queen and the royal family removed to St. Ger main's, and the ministerial party besieged Paris. Turenne, who at first supported them, was gained over by the rebels. The women, who have always their part in the disturbances of France, had a conspicuous share in those of the Fronde. A short pacification ensued ; but the imprudent violence of Mazarin soon renewed"], [419, "SECT. 64. MODERN HISTORY. 401 the disorders. At length the parliament of Paris assumed the right of banishing this unpopular minister, who retired to the Imperial dominions, though his influence continued still to regulate the measures of state. 3. A change ensued on the KingVeoming of age, 1652. De Retz and Orleans, the chief promoters of the rebellion, were banished, and Mazarin resumed his station as minister. \u2014 Conde had joined the Spaniards in an attack on the French Netherlands, but was overmatched by Turenne, who revenged this insult by the taking of Dunkirk, and several fortified towns under the Spanish government. Dunkirk was, by convention with Cromwell, ceded to the English, and afterwards sold back to France, as we have seen, by Charles II. 4. The war with Spain, [a sort of supplement or appendage to the Thirty Years' war,] was ended in 1659, by the peace of the Pyrenees. Many cessions were made on both sides, but France kept Roussillon and part of Artois. It was stipulated that Lewis XIV. should marry the Infanta, daughter of Philip IV., but should renounce all right that might thence open to the crown of Spain. 5. The treaty of the Pyrenees gave peace to VOL. II. D D"], [420, "402 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. the south of Europe ; and the wars in the north between Sweden, Poland, and Denmark, which arose aster the abdication of Christina of Swe den, were terminated in the year following by the treaty of Oliva. Christina, a singular but not a great character, held the sceptre of Sweden for twenty-two years after the death of her father, Gustavus Adolphus ; till at length, tired of the cares of government, and affecting a passion for literature and philosophy, she resigned the crown in 1654, to her cousin Charles X. ; an example which was followed soon after by Casimir King of Poland, though after an ho nourable reign, and for a better reason, age and sickness. 6. Mazarin died in 1661, and Lewis XIV. entered on a vigorous and splendid caree* The finances, which from the time of Henry IV. had been in extreme disorder, were admirably regulated by Colbert. [The character of this able minister was so well known to Mazarin, that he is said, on his death-bed, to have claimed credit with the King, for having introduced him to his notice. \" I owe every thing to Your Majesty,\" said the dying minister ; \" but I feel that I am repaying part of the debt, by making you acquainted with Colbert ;\" and they were"], [421, "SECT. 64.

The canal of Languedoc joined the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean ; the prin cipal sea-ports were enlarged and fortified ; and the internal police of the kingdom was regularly and strictly enforced. The arms of France aided at the same time England against the Dutch, Germany against the Turks, and Por tugal against Spain. 7. On the death of Philip IV., Lewis, on pre tence that Spain had failed in payment of the dowry of his Queen, besieged and took Lisle, [in the year I667,] with several other fortified towns of Flanders, and in the next campaign made himself master of Franche-Comte. The Sovereign marched with his armies, but the glory of these conquests was owing to Turenne and Vauban. The triple alliance hastily formed, [under the auspices of Sir William Temple,] by England, Holland, and Sweden, checked this career, and brought about the treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle, 1668, by which Lewis, though he re tained Flanders, restored Franche-Comte, and confirmed the peace of the Pyrenees. d d 2"], [422, "404 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 8. The strength and prosperity of the king- dom continued to increase under the able admi- nistration of Colbert and Louvois. The civil factions of Holland between the Stadtholder and the party of the De Witts tempted Lewis to undertake the conquest of that country ; and England, Germany, and Sweden, favoured his views. He overran the provinces of Utrecht, Overyssel, and Guelderland, and advanced almost to the gates of Amsterdam, when the Dutch inundated the country by letting in the sea, and the French were forced to retreat. 9. The confederate powers now became jeal ous of the ascendancy of France ; and the Prince of Orange, [in whose family the stadtholdership had just been made hereditary,] had sufficient influence with England, and both branches of the house of Austria, to obtain their alliance in aid of the republic. The arms of Lewis, however, still continued to be successful, and the peace concluded at Nimeguen, in I678, [against the wishes of the Stadtholder,] was much to the honour [and advantage] of France. Franche- Comte was assured as a part of her dominions, and Spain allowed her right by conquest to a great proportion of the Netherlands. [Sweden suffered severely in this way through the efforts"], [423, "SECT. 64. MODERN HISTORY. 405 of Frederic- William, Elector of Brandenburg, a strenuous ally of the united provinces, and the last to lay down his arms.] 10. Notwithstanding the peace, Lewis, with the most culpable insincerity, seized Strasburg, [occupied Casal, the capital of Mountserrat, dis turbed the Swiss by erecting the fortification of Huningen, attacked Luxemburg, insulted the Genoese,] and secretly took part with the Hun garians and Turks in their attack on the Imperial dominions. Vienna must have fallen into the hands of the Turks, had it not been seasonably relieved by the victorious arms of John Sobieski, King of Poland, 1683. 11. One of the weakest and most impolitic measures of Lewis XIV. was the revocation of the edict of Nantes, granted by Henry IV. for the toleration of the Protestants. While their worship was suppressed, their churches de molished, and their ministers banished, the Pro testant laity were forbidden, under the most rigorous penalties, to quit the kingdom, 1685. France, however, by this measure lost above 500,000 of her most industrious and useful sub jects ; [who eagerly transferred their property, talents, and industry, to Prussia, Holland, and other Protestant states ;] and the name of d d 3"], [424, "406 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Lewis XIV. was execrated over a great part of Europe. \u2014 It was not long after this time that a similar excess of intolerant bigotry precipitated James II. from the throne of Britain, and forced him to seek an asylum from the monarch of France. 12. William Prince of Orange, the inveterate enemy of Lewis, brought about the league of Augsburg, 1686 ; and the war was renewed with France by Germany, Spain, England, and Hol land. The French arms were still successful. Luxemburg defeated William in the battles of Steenkirk and Nerwinden ; Noailles was vic torious in Spain ; and an army of 100,000 French ravaged the Palatinate, [in the most lawless and cruel manner,] and took many of the most important towns on the Rhine ; [the principal of which were absolutely razed to their found ations.] This was the crisis of the glory of Lewis, whose fortunes were to sustain the most morti fying reverse. 13. Those various and most extensive military enterprises, however flattering to the pride of the monarch, had been attended with enormous expense, and no solid . advantage to the nation. The finances had fallen into disorder after the death of Colbert. [No ally remained to France but the Grand Signior, who was unable to check"], [425, "SECT. 64. MODERN HISTORY. 407 the operations of the Emperor on toe Rhine.] A peace was absolutely necessary ; and by the treaty of Ryswick, concluded in 1697, Lewis restored to Spain all the conquests made in the two last wars, several towns to the Emperor, the duchy of Lorraine to its duke, and acknow ledged the right of William to the crown of England. 14. The succession to the kingdom of Spain, on the expected death of Charles II. without issue, was now the object of political intrigue. The Emperor and the King of France had the only natural right of succession, [having mar ried Charles's daughters ;] but William III. of England, from the dread of such an increase of power to either, proposed a treaty of partition of the Spanish dominions, at home and abroad, be tweed the Elector of Bavaria, the Dauphin, and the Emperor's second son. Charles II., [who was inclined to act justly,] chose rather to make his own destination, and appointed by will that the Duke of Anjou, second son of the Dauphin, should inherit Spain ; [particularly stipulating that the latter kingdom should remain an undi vided and independent monarchy.] On his death without issue, it was to devolve on the Arch duke Charles, youngest son of the Emperor. d d 4"], [426, "408 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 15. On the death of Charles, the Duke of Anjou succeeded to the throne of Spain, in virtue of this settlement. The Emperor, the King of England, and the Dutch, proposed to separate from his crown the Spanish dominions in Italy. In this enterprise Prince Eugene, son of the Count de Soissons, commanded the Im perial troops, an illustrious renegado from France, of great prowess and military skill. 16. James II. of England died in 1701 at St. Germain's, and Lewis gave mortal offence to that government by acknowledging the title of his son, [whom the English parliament had excluded from the succession, and who had been passed over at the treaty of Ryswick.] On the death of King William in the year fol lowing, war was declared by England, Holland, and the Empire, against France and Spain. Lewis XIV. was now in the decline of life. He had lost the ablest of his ministers and his greatest Generals. The finances of the kingdom were exhausted. The armies of his enemies were commanded by Eugene and the Duke of Marl borough, the ablest Generals of the age, and supported by the treasures of the united powers. Savoy and Portugal joined this formidable con federacy, to overwhelm both branches of the"], [427, "SECT. 64.

Marlborough took Venlo, Ruremonde, and Liege, and, together with Eugene, defeated Tallard and Marsin, with the Elector of Bavaria, in the signal battle of Blenheim, 1704. England and Holland attacked Spain by sea and land. Catalonia and Valencia were subdued in six weeks ; and Gibraltar, taken by the English, has ever since remained with them. In the battle of Ramifies, Marlborough defeated Vil leroy, and left 20,000 dead on the field. The contest, at first doubtful in Italy, ended alike disastrously for the house of Bourbon. The Archduke Charles was in the mean time pro claimed King at Madrid ; and Philip V. had serious thoughts of abandoning Spain, and es tablishing his dominion in America. But the successes of the Duke of Berwick, natural son of James II., recovered for a while his desponding spirit, and even prompted his grand father Lewis to avenge himself on England, by aiding the bold but desperate enterprise of es tablishing the Pretender James on the throne of Britain. 18. But France and Spain were daily losing ground. The Pope had acknowledged the title"], [428, "410 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. of the Archduke Charles ; the English seized the Mediterranean islands ; and Lewis, fallen from all his proud pretensions, humbly entreated a peace, wThich was refused, unless on the con- dition of his dethroning his grandson with his own arms. He maintained for a while this un- equal contest, and was at length forced to pro- pose terms equally humiliating ; the cession of all his conquests in the Netherlands and on the Rhine ; the acknowledgment of the Archduke's title to the crown of Spain ; and a promise to give no aid to his grandson ; but these were re- fused, and the inhuman condition still insisted on, that he should himself assist in dethroning his grandson. A last exertion was made in Spain under the Duke of Vendome, at the head of a prodigious army ; and the victory obtained by the French at Villa- Vitiosa restored Philip V. to the throne of Spain. His competitor, the Archduke, soon after became Emperor, on the death of his elder brother. 19. The intrigues of the cabinet of Queen Anne, and the coming in of a Tory ministry, changed the politics of Europe. It was re solved to make peace with France and Spain, and the treaty was concluded at Utrecht, 1713. It was stipulated that Philip King of Spain"], [429, "SECT. 64. 411 MODERN HISTORY. should renounce all eventual right to the crown of France, as his brother should to the crown of Spain ; the Dutch obtained an extension of frontier ; the Emperor a great part of Spanish Flanders ; the English gained from Spain, Gib raltar and Minorca, and from France, Acadia, Newfoundland, and Hudson's Bay ; with one term most humbling to the latter, the demoli tion of the harbour of Dunkirk. [The acquisition of Gibraltar was not merely of importance to the English as securing to themselves an en trance to the Mediterranean sea, but as ren dering their friendship and alliance of more im portance to the northern, and other powers, trafficking in those parts.] In the following year a peace was concluded at Rastadt between France and the Empire. 20. The conclusion of this peace, aster an hon ourable war, was the most memorable event in the reign of Queen Anne, if we except the Union of the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, 1706, which was brought about by the negociation of commissioners mutually chosen, to secure the rights of either kingdom in the best manner for their mutual benefit. It was stipulated that they should be represented by one parliament, (Sect. LIX. \u00a7 8.) but that each kingdom should retain"], [430, "412 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. its own laws and its established religion, and that they should have the same privileges with respect to commerce. The succession to the crown was limited to the house of Hanover. Queen Anne died 30th July, 1714, and Lewis XIV. on 1st September, 1715, in the 78th year of his age ; a prince of great vigour of mind, of good talents, though unimproved by education, of dignified yet amiable manners, and whose greatest fault was his inordinate ambition, to which he sacrificed the real interests of his people. It was his highest honour, that he dis- cerned and recompensed every species of merit ; and France was in his time equally illustrious by the great military talents] of her Generals, and by the splendour of literature and the arts and sciences. [He rendered his nation the arbitress in matters of wit, taste, and politeness ; and by encouraging the resort of foreigners to the me- tropolis, and promoting in a high degree every branch of learning, nearly raised the French lan guage to a level with the Latin, as an universal vehicle of intercourse and communication.]"], [431, "SECT. 65. 413 MODERN HISTORY. LXV. OF THE CONSTITUTION OF FRANCE UNDER THE MONARCHY. 1. It is necessary, for understanding the his tory of France, that we should have some ac quaintance with its former monarchical constitu tion ; and we shall very briefly trace the progress of its government under the different races of its sovereigns. The regal prerogative was, under the Merovingian princes, extremely limited. (See Sect. II. III.) The general asssembly of the nation had the right of electing the sovereign, and the power of legislation. Under the Car lovingian race, the authority acquired by Pepin and Charlemagne sunk to nothing in the hands of their weak posterity ; and though the crown had ceased to be elective, the regal dignity was a mere shadow. The power of the state had passed into the hands of a turbulent aristocracy, ever at variance among themselves, and uniting only to abase the crown and oppress the people. 2. Under the third Capetian race, the crown"], [432, "414 PART II. MODERN HISTORY. acquired more weight, and many of the so vereigns exerted a proper spirit in restraining the power and punishing the lawless outrages of the nobles. It was to balance the weight of the aristocracy that Philip the Fair introduced the third estate to the national assemblies, which for above four centuries had consisted only of the nobles and clergy. The chief power of the state began now to shift to the scale of the mo narch. The national assembly interfered rather to ratify than to decree ; and in the fifteenth century the right of legislation was understood to reside wholly in the crown. The right of tax ation seemed to follow of course ; and the as semblies or states-general were now rarely convened, and from the reign of Lewis XIII. entirely laid aside. 3. But another power gradually arose in the state, which in some measure supplied their function in limiting the royal prerogative. The parliaments were originally nothing more than the chief courts of justice in the territory where they were established. The parliament of Paris had naturally a higher respect and dignity than those of the provinces, and, acquiring a right of appeal from their decrees, was considered as the paramount jurisdiction, and the depository of"], [433, "SECT. 65. MODERN HISTORY. 415 the laws of the kingdom. The sovereigns of France, on first assuming the powers of legisla tion and taxation, produced their edicts to be registered in that court, and frequently con sulted with its members on momentous affairs of state, as in questions of peace, war, or al liance. Thus the nation began to regard the parliament of Paris as a body which shared the powers of government with the monarch ; and, in the latter reigns, the parliament availed itself of that general opinion, and made a bold stand in opposing any arbitrary stretches of the King's authority, by refusing to verify and register his edicts. 4. But as this power of the parliament was in reality an usurpation, it was constantly a sub ject of dispute. The members of this court were in no sense the representatives of the people, or vested with any portion of the con- stitutional authority of the national assemblies. They were in the King's nomination, removable by him at pleasure, and even subject to entire annihilation as a body at his command. Nay, without so violent a remedy, the sovereign could at any time frustrate their opposition to his will, by appearing personally in the hall of parliament, and commanding his edict to be registered."], [434, "416 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 5. Yet even a power thus easily defeasible had its advantages to the state, and operated as a very considerable restraint on the royal au thority. Considering itself as the guardian of the public liberty, it remonstrated against all arbitrary encroachments of the crown, and by giving alarm to the nation, furnished an oppo sition sufficiently powerful to obtain its ends. The provincial parliaments, although they like wise registered the royal edicts, never assumed any similar authority. They were no more than the chief courts of civil judicature. 6. The King of France was therefore to be considered as an absolute monarch, but whose authority was in some degree limited by the consuetudinary regulations of the state, and could not easily become entirely despotic and tyrannical. The crown was hereditary, but could not descend to a female, [though females might become regents,] nor to a natural son. The royal revenue was partly fixed and partly arbitrary. The former comprehended the royal domains, the duties on wines and salt, the land tax, capitation-tax, and gift of the clergy ; the latter arose from all other taxes which the mo narch thought fit to impose, and from the sale"], [435, "SECT. 66. 417 MODERN HISTORY. of offices. Most of these duties were leased out to the fafmers-general. 7. The Gallican church, though Catholic, and acknowledging the spiritual authority of the Pope, had greatly abridged his ancient prerogatives within the kingdom. The assembly of the church, in 1682, declared, that no tem poral sovereign could be deposed by the Pope, or subjects absolved from their allegiance : it decreed the subjection of the Pope to the coun cils of the church, and denied his infallibility when in opposition to the canons of those coun cils. The Pope had no power to levy money in France without the royal licence. In short, the ecclesiastical authority was in all respects subordinate to the civil. LXVI. OF PETER THE GREAT, CZAR OF MUSCOVY, AND CHARLES XII. KING OF SWEDEN. 1.

Russia is said to have received the light of Christianity in the tenth century ; [and in the eleventh, under Vladimer I. and his successor, to have made some advances towards refinement and civilization, through its communication with Greece and Constantinople, but which were crushed, and all traces of them obliterated by the invasion of the Tartars, so that] its history is scarcely known till the middle of the fifteenth. At that period John Basilowitz, [or the son of Basil,] redeemed the empire from its subjection to the Tartars, and extended its limits. His successors maintained a considerable splendour as sovereigns ; but their dominions were uncul tivated, and their subjects barbarians. Alexis Michaelowitz, father of Peter the Great, was the first who published a code of laws. It was not till the end of the sixteenth century that Siberia was added to the empire, which till then was bounded by the limits of Europe. 2.

He began by breaking the turbulent militia of the Strelitzes, and by degrees formed a regular army of 12,000 men, on the strictest model of discipline. He employed some Dutch men to build a small fleet, and made the first experiment of his arms in taking Azof, [situated at the mouth of the river Don,] from the Turks, 1696, [by which he gained a passage for his subjects into the Black Sea, and where, in a very short space of time, he established a navy.] 8. Having gained the little instruction he possessed from foreigners, Peter resolved to travel in search of knowledge. Appointing Le Fort, an able Genevese, his ambassador, he travelled as a private person in his suite through Germany to Holland, and studied the art of ship-building, by working in the docks with his own hands. Thence he passed to England, and in a similar manner acquired the knowledge of every art fitted for the improvement of his kingdom. The relative sciences were cultivated with the same ardour and success; and in E e 2"], [438, "420 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. sixteen months he returned to Moscow to reduce those important acquirements into practice. 4. Regiments were raised and trained to ex ercise on the German model ; the finances ar ranged and systematised ; the church reformed by new canons and regulations ; the patriarchate abolished ; and a much abused civil and criminal jurisdiction taken from the clergy. It was ne cessary to carry this reform even to the abolition of the national dress, and the suppression of ancient usages and habits of life ; innovations reluctantly submitted to, but enforced by abso lute power. 5. While this great genius was thus employed in new-modelling and polishing a barbarous empire, a competitor arose to dispute with him the sovereignty of the North, and divide the admiration of Europe. Charles XII. succeeded to the throne of Sweden, 1695, at fifteen years of age ; a prince whose singular heroism of cha racter and extraordinary achievements have ranked him with the greatest conquerors of antiquity. The situation of his kingdom speedily brought his genius into display. Russia, Poland, and Denmark, joined in a league to seize and share his dominions. The attack was begun by"], [439, "SECT. 66. 421 MODERN HISTORY. the Danes on Holstein, while the King of Poland invaded Livonia, and the Czar, Ingria. Charles immediately landed an army on Zealand, at the gates of Copenhagen ; and in six weeks forced the Dane to purchase the safety of his capital and kingdom, by laying down his arms, and making full indemnity to the Duke of Holstein. The Swedish monarch now hastened into Ingria ; and at the battle of Narva defeated 60,000 of the Russians, and took 30,000 prisoners. Such was the first campaign of Charles XIL, then a boy of seventeen. 6. Poland was destined to receive a yet more humiliating chastisement. Charles reduced Cour land and Lithuania, penetrated into the heart of the kingdom, and subdued the capitals of Warsaw and Cracow. He then assembled the states, declared King Augustus deposed, and signified his pleasure that Stanislaus, his own dependent, should be elected Sovereign of Po land. The factions of the kingdom aided this revolution, and the will of Charles was complied with. The deposed King retired to his electoral dominions of Saxony. 7. A negotiation begun with the Czar was abruptly terminated by Charles, who declared he would only negotiate at Moscow ; and en- e E 3"], [440, "422 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. tering the Russian dominions with 45,000 men, he was in the way of making good his threat, when he was induced, by a treacherous promise of aid from the Cossacks, to march through the Ukraine in the dead of winter. His army was wasted by fatigue and famine, when he was encountered by the Czar at Pultowa ; and the fate of Russia, Sweden, and Poland, hung upon that battle. Charles was entirely defeated ; 9000 Swedes fell in the field, and 14,000 were taken prisoners, 1709. Augustus was restored to the throne of Poland, and the Czar took possession of Finland and Livonia. 8. With the wreck of his army, reduced to 1800 men, Charles retreated into the Turkish dominions, and formed a camp near Bender. He endeavoured to prevail with the Grand Seignior to arm against the Czar, and suc- ceeded after a long negotiation. Two hundred thousand Turks took the field ; and the Czar's army, infinitely inferior in number, was sur- rounded, and, after ineffectual resistance, forced to capitulate to the Grand Vizier. \u2014 The news of this capitulation was dea\u00a3h to all the hopes of Charles ; and his subsequent conduct seems the result of phrenzy. The Grand Seignior having intimated his desire that the Swedes"], [441, "SECT. 66. 423 MODERN HISTORY. should quit his territories, Charles fortified his camp, and declared he would defend it to the last extremity. After every means ineffectually tried to make him alter this resolution, he was attacked by the Turkish army, and taken fight ing sword in hand amidst a massacre of his troops. 9. The Czar and the King of Denmark were in the mean time tearing Sweden to pieces. Charles returned in disguise with two of his officers to his own dominions, and immediately conceived the design of wresting Norway from Denmark. Failing in the outset of this enter prise, he was persuaded by Gortz, his prime mi nister, to engage in another, the dethroning of of George II., seizing a part of his continental dominions, and placing the Pretender James on the throne of England. This project was con certed between Gortz and Alberoni, prime mi nister of Philip V. The Czar joined in the scheme, and made peace with Sweden ; but an unforeseen event broke all their measures. In besieging the Norwegian fortress, of Frederick shall, Charles XJL was killed by a cannon-ball, 11th December, 1718. 10. Sweden gained by the death of Charles a reformation of her government, and a salutary E E 4"], [442, "424 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. limitation of the arbitrary power of the sove reign. His sister Ulrica succeeded to the throne, and raised to it her husband, Frederick Land grave of Hesse-Cassel. The States made peace with all the hostile powers. The Czar was now engaged in a war with Persia, in the view of obtaining the command and commerce of the Caspian. This object he accomplished, and gained, by cession from the Sophi, three pro vinces of the Persian empire. 11. Peter the Great died 28th January, 1725, and was succeeded by the Czarina Catherine, formerly a Livonian captive, but who possessed merit equal to her elevated situation. His only son, Alexis Petrowitz, [under whose sway the Czar is said to have suspected that Russia would fall back into her former state of bar barism,] had been condemned to lose his life for treason ; and the mode of his death, which im mediately followed his condemnation, is at this moment unknown. [The whole proceeding tends to show, that though the mind of the Czar might be capacious, he was in manners, morals, and principle, little better than a half-civilised barbarian.] Russia owes to Peter the Great all those beneficial improvements which have raised her, within the period of a century, from bar-"], [443, "SECT. 66. MODERN HISTORY. 425 barism and obscurity, to the highest rank among the powers of Europe. [His conquest of Livonia, Ingria, and Carelia, which he took from Sweden, gave him a footing on the shores of the Baltic, brought Russia forward as a commercial nation, and led to the establishments at Cronstadt and Petersburgh. The trade of Archangel, indeed, from this time declined, but the Czar had been previously careful to secure to himself a passage into the Black Sea, where he actually established a navy. Early in the eighteenth century, Peters burgh had become a commercial city of no small importance, thus securing to the Russians an ample share in the trade, both of the west and east.]"], [444, "426 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. LXVII. A VIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND LI- TERATURE IN EUROPE : FROM THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH TO THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. 1. We have seen how much literature and the sciences were indebted to the art of printing for their advancement and dissemination towards the end of the fifteenth century. (Sect. XXXIV. \u00a7 12.) From that period classical learning, cri ticism, poetry, and history, made a rapid pro gress in most of the kingdoms of Europe. Phi losophy did not keep pace. The dogmas of Aristotle had possession of the schools down to the seventeenth century, and had engrafted themselves even on the doctrines of theology. It required a superior genius to dissipate this mist of error, and break those fetters on all advance ment in useful science ; and such was the great Bacon, Lord Verulam, the most profound phi losopher, and perhaps the most universal genius,"], [445, "SECT. 67. 427 MODERN HISTORY. that any age has produced. We find in his works an estimate of the actual attainments in all the sciences, a catalogue of the desiderata in in each department, and a detail of the methods best suited to prosecute improvement and new discoveries. In fine, we owe to Bacon the sure method of advancing in knowledge by experi ment and the observation of nature, instead of system and conjecture. 2. The philosophy of Bacon produced its ef fect only by slow degrees. Gassendi, though he exposed the doctrines of Aristotle, was still a theorist, and attempted to revive the atomic system of Epicurus. Des Cartes followed in the same track, and reared a whimsical theory of the universe, produced, as he supposed, by the for tuitous combination of atoms, moving in vortices through the immensity of space ; a theory re commended by the ingenuity with which it was supported, and its apparently solving many of the phenomena of nature. Copernicus had, a century before, published his system of the planets, which, though condemned by the church, was received by Des Cartes and the best philosophers. 3. Galileo, in 1609, constructed telescopes, (Sect. XXXIV. \u00a7 5.) and discovered [the Phases"], [446, "428 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. of the planet Venus, the spots on the sun and moon,] the satellites of the larger planets, and their motions, for which he was rewarded by imprisonment, as a supporter of the Coper nican heresy, [though he had laboured hard to convince his prejudiced judges that the system of the latter was in fact not heretical, nor at variance with the sacred writings.] Kepler, [the friend and disciple of Tycho Brahe,] inves tigated the laws which regulate the motions of the planets, and the analogy between their dis tances from the sun and periodical revolutions. [He was the first who ventured to assert that the sun revolved on its axis, which the glasses of Galileo fifteen years afterwards confirmed.] The discoveries in astronomy led to improvements in navigation, and a great advancement of geometry in all its branches. Napier, in 1614, abridged calculation by the invention of logarithms. The Torricellian experiments determined the weight of the atmosphere. In 1616, Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood. 4. The Royal Society, which originated from private meetings of the English philosophers, was incorporated by Charles II. in 1662, and has greatly contributed to the advancement of the sciences and useful arts. The Royal Academy of"], [447, "SECT. 67. MODERN HISTORY. 429 Sciences was instituted in 1666 by Lewis XIV. ; and similar institutions were founded in most of the countries of Europe ; among which there is a communication of science, and a laudable emu lation excited by the publication of their Trans actions. 5. In the end of the seventeenth century arose the immortal Newton, who, by exhausting the most important discoveries of the laws of nature, has rendered it impossible for posterity to eclipse his fame. He had discovered, before the age of twenty-four, the theory of universal gravitation, a principle which solves the chief phenomena of nature, and collects and regulates the whole machine of the universe. His theory of light and colours is the foundation of the whole science of optics, and his Principia the basis and elements of all philosophy. 6. Locke, the contemporary of Newton, suc cessfully applied Lord Bacon's mode of investi gation to the study of the human mind ; and, utterly rejecting the systems of the old philo sophers, examined the soul by attending to its operations. From the simple fact that all know ledge is progressive, and that an infant gains its ideas gradually through the medium of its senses, he drew the general conclusion, that"], [448, "430 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. there are no innate ideas in the mind, but all are either immediate perceptions conveyed by the senses, or acts of the mind reflecting on those perceptions ; a conclusion which has been obstinately controverted, chiefly by draw ing from it false consequences, but which has never yet been shaken. 7. The progress of literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was equally remark able with that of science and philosophy. Tris sino was the first of the moderns who composed an epic poem in the language of his country, L' Italia Liberata da Goti, and the first Italian who wrote a regular tragedy, Sophonisba. Of much superior merit to the epic poem of Tris sino is the Lusiad of the Portuguese Camoens, a work abounding in passages of high poetic beauty, and displaying a sublime imagination. In the end of the sixteenth century Spain pro duced the Araucana of Er cilia, an epic poem of great inequality of merit, but frequently ex hibiting novelty of figures and bold conceptions. The subject is a revolt of the Peruvians against the Spaniards. 8. But the principal epic poems of this age are the Orlando Furioso of Ariosto, and the Gierusalemme Liberata of Tasso; the former"], [449, "SECT. 67. MODERN HISTORY. 431 work most irregular in its plan, most uncon nected and desultory in its conduct, most ex travagant and absurd in the characters of its persons, but displaying alternately every excel lence of poetry in the various departments of the descriptive, comic, satiric, moral, and sublime. The Gierusakmme of Tasso, of a regular plan and perfect polish in its structure, has been fre quently brought in comparison with the equally high-finished poem of the \u00c6neid ; nor does the Italian suffer much in the comparison. There is a romantic charm both in the incidents and characters of his poem which must ever render it a favourite with all readers of genuine taste. 9. From the time of Tasso, the genius of epic poetry lay dormant for a century, till the days of Milton ; for the Fairy Queen of Spenser is rather a romantic allegory than an epic poem. The Paradise Lost, compared with the great poems of antiquity, is more irregular and less perfect as a whole than the Iliad, \u00c6neid, and Odyssey, but exhibits in detached parts more of the sublime and beautiful than them all. It has been well remarked, that the inequality of this poem arises in a great measure from the nature of the subject, of which some parts are the most lofty that can enter into the human mind, and"], [450, "432 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. others could only have been supported by a laborious elegance and polish, which the author's genius could not stoop to bestow. 10. Lyric poetry was cultivated in the six teenth century, in Italy, France, and England, but with no high success. The lesser poems of Ariosto and Tasso have no tincture of the ge nius displayed in their greater works. Chiabrera is perhaps the only lyric poet of this period that merits distinction. In France, Ronsard and Bellay imitated Petrarch with all his false wit, but without his passion. Marot, however, in the naivete and easy vein of his humour, is justly accounted the master of La Fontaine. In the beginning of the seventeenth century, French versification received a considerable polish from the compositions of Racan, and yet more from those of Malherbe ; and towards the end of that century lyric poetry was cultivated with high success by La Farre, Chapelle, and Bachaumont, Chaulieu, and Gresset. 11. The English lyric poetry of the sixteenth century, of Spenser, Surrey, Harrington, Syd ney, and even Shakspeare, is harsh and inharmo nious ; nor is much improvement discernible till the time of Cowley and Waller. The merit of Cowley as a lyric poet was too highly prized"], [451, "SECT. 67. MODERN HISTORY. 433 in his own age, and is under-rated in ours. With all his false wit, pedantry, and obscurity, he is often both sublime and pathetic in no mo derate degree. The lyric ode in the third book of the Davideis has few parallels in the English language. As a prose-writer, Cowley shines in that age with superior excellence. Waller is more polished and harmonious than any of the preceding or contemporary poets, but his wit is quaint, and his elevation too frequently bombast. 12. Dry den, in the end of the seventeenth century, carried lyric poetry to its highest per fection. His Ode on St. Cecilia's Day surpasses all the lyric compositions both of antiquity and modern times. He shines conspicuously as a satirist, possessing the keen and caustic wit, without the indelicacy, of Juvenal or Horace. His versions from Chaucer and Boccaccio are easy and spirited, and display a happy talent for poetical narrative. His numerous dramatic pieces, though exhibiting both invention and poetic beauty, are deficient in true passion, and in the just delineation of character. 13. It was not till the end of the sixteenth century that the drama in Europe began to fur nish a rational entertainment. At that period, VOL. II. F F"], [452, "434 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. Lope de Vega and Calderona in Spain, and Shakspeare in England, produced those pieces, which, though irregular and stained with ble mishes, are at this day the admiration of their countrymen. The Spanish plays of that age nave been a rich mine for succeeding dramatists, both among the French, Italians, and English. The merits of Shakspeare are familiar to every person of taste. Ignorant of the rules of his art, he is the pure child of nature, and thus exhibits often her caprices and absurdities ; but these are redeemed by the most transcendant beauties. The old English drama is, with all its irregularities, incomparably superior to the modern, both in touching the passions and in displaying just views of human character. The persons are more discriminated by various and appropriate features, and the nicer shades of nearly resembling characters are thus more dis tinctly marked. The mixture of the comic and tragic in the same plot, though condemned by modern practice, is a great source of pleasure in the pieces of Shakspeare and his contemporaries ; nor is there any thing in such a mixture, but what is consonant to nature. To a person of true taste, it will be found often to heighten, by contrast, the capital emotion to be excited."], [453, "SECT. 67. 435 MODERN HISTORY. 14. The compositions for the French stage, in the end of the seventeenth century, are strictly conformable to dramatic rules, and many of those pieces are models of a correct and polished taste. The morality of the French drama of that age and the next is, in general, purer than ours ; but their pieces are deficient in the nice delineation of character, and in the power of exciting the passions. Corneille and Racine brought the French tragedy to its highest elevation, as Moliere the comedy. Corneille has more grandeur and sublimity than his rival, who excels him in the tender and pathetic. The comedies of Moliere, highly amusing in the present time, were more particularly valu able in the age when they were written, and had a sensible effect in correcting its prevailing follies ; the pedantry of the ladies, the ignorance and quackery of the physicians, and the pride and arrogance of the French noblesse. The last of the eminent dramatists who adorned France in the seventeenth century, was the elder Crebillon, who drew many sublime and impassioned scenes from the source of terror ; and who, in all his works, was as eminently the friend of virtue as his worthless son has been the pander of vice. F F 2"], [454, "436 MODERN HISTORY. PART II. 15. The most eminent historians of the sixteenth century are, De Thou, Davila, and Machiavel. De Thou has written the annals of his own time, from 1545 to 1607, with great judgment, and in most elegant Latin com position. The history of Davila, the annals of the Civil Wars of France in the time of the Leagues, though the work of a partisan, is com posed with no common degree of candour and impartiality. Machiavel wrote, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, the History of Florence, of which the style is classical and the matter well arranged, but too much interrupted by reflections and political discussions. In the seventeenth century, Bentivoglio composed his History of the Civil Wars of Flanders with the most accurate knowledge of his subject, per spicuity of narrative, and eloquence of style. Among the English historians in the beginning of that period Rawleigh is the most distinguished, though his History of the World is, in point of style, inferior to the judgment shown in the arrangement of the matter. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, Clarendon's History of the Rebellion is a work of the highest merit, whether we consider the authenticity of its facts, the deep knowledge of human nature displayed"], [455, "SECT. 67. MODERN HISTORY. 437 in the delineation of the characters, or the grave and manly eloquence of the style.
