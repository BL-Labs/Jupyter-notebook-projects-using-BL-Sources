When she happened to observe Mrs. Austin and Mr. South she thought they seemed to be very good friends ; and 'when they were out of sight she supposed that they were to gether somewhere and getting on nicely. She did not quite know what she would get them for a wedding present, but she determined to run np to town with Frank and look about her. There were sure to be pretty things in the shops.

Gilbert made no attempt to resume the talk which was broken off in the ruined castle. He appeared to have tacitly accepted Mrs. Austin's offer of friendship without explanations ; and though from time to time he would turn to her with some allusion to the past, some \"Do you remember?\" which sent her thoughts away from Culverdale to scenes where he alone could follow, he touched always on those earlier recollections which needed no apology from him and no pardon from her. She would answer readily enough ; but Gilbert, who remembered the time when she believed in him, was apt to imagine a delicate yet unmistakable irony in her untroubled smile. To Frank it revealed a wonderful, far-off tranquillity ; but then Frank was very much in love. Mrs. Austin had opened his eyes, and he was prepared to spend his life in a rapturous study of this first miracle. He felt himself at a disadvantage with"], [13, "3 Ill MRS. AUSTIN regard to South, who could look back to a past in which she had a share, instead of a degrading memory of measles and extreme youth ; yet, in spite of his humility, he was not unhappy. Mrs. Austin could not fail to perceive his devotion, but she never for one moment supposed that there was anything serious or lasting in it. It seemed to her like a little nosegay of spring flowers, which she might accept with a gracious word of thanks, and she was touched by the thought of its very transitoriness. She was very kind to Frank. Within a week she had learnt his ways and looks and words as one might learn the few simple notes of a bird in one's garden ; and yet they pleased her better than a more elaborate performance. \" Eoor fellow ! \" she would say to herself, with a half- whimsical regret, \"it is not my fault \u2014 I cannot help it ; but if he only knew how young he seems to me, how he would hate me !\" There, however, she was wrong. Frank would have forgiven her even that. The warm September days slipped away one"], [14, "in 4 MRS. AUSTIN after the other, and the only thing of which the young lover could complain was that they were shortened in a quite unjustifiable way, which was not mentioned in the almanac. The sun was slow to rise ; but when once breakfast- time had arrived, he rushed across the heavens, went headlong down the west, and Frank found himself dressing for dinner, with the certainty that only a few short hours parted him from bedtime. It is true that the nights had grown long, so long that they could not all be spent in sleep. His light burned late, and even when it was extinguished it did not follow that he was at rest. Sometimes he was star-gazing. He had never taken such particular notice of the stars before, but they attracted him now because they reminded him of Mrs. Austin. He had made the discovery that certain things \u2014 besides old teapots \u2014 were in harmony with Mrs. Austin, and consequently possessed something of her charm ; and he was beginning a classification of the contents of the universe, as tried by this test. He felt that the midnight sky was very"], [15, "Ill MRS. AUSTIN 5 sublime, and that he himself was absurdly unim portant. How could he become more worthy of notice ? What sort of destinies used people to fancy they read in the stars ? Frank, as he leaned against his window and fixed his eyes upon the far-off points of light, reflected that in all proba bility he would be High Sheriff one of these days. He wondered whether Mrs. Austin would like a man to be Sheriff. But that would only be for a year. Perhaps it would be better to try to get into Parliament. There was a neighbouring borough wliich was something of a forlorn hope \u2014 he might try that. There must be an election before long ; perhaps Mrs. Austin would come down, wear his colours, encourage his supporters, and rejoice in his victory. Only \u2014 confound it ! \u2014 the ballot had spoilt all the fun, and there was no chance of a real good contest, such as they used to have in old times, when the flags were flying, the money going, and the agents outwitting each other for days together. He would have liked the gathering excitement of a prolonged battle ; he"], [16, "6 MES. AUSTIN \"I would not even have minded a little rioting ; in fact, an unfriendly mob, howling down any attempt at speech, and to be confronted only with good humoured coolness and the superior manners of a gentleman, seemed less terrible to Frank than cold-blooded voters asking questions about his views on unexpected subjects. Nevertheless, for Mrs. Austin's sake, he would face even that ordeal. He remembered, moreover, that the father of one of the neighbouring landowners had been made a baronet \u2014 why might not he be made a baronet ? It is true that, for his own part, he had no especial desire to be called \" Sir Francis,\" but \" Lady Leicester\" seemed to him a name not unworthy to be uttered softly, at night, in the presence of the stars. Mrs. Austin knew nothing of these soaring dreams, which only awaited a word from her lips to become serious intentions. She had no par ticular ambition on Frank's behalf; in fact, the young squire and his surroundings seemed to her almost ideally perfect. The very heaviness of life"], [17, "Ill MRS. AUSTIN 7 at Culverdale pleased her; there wTas something solid, respectable, and sincere about it ; a sense of prosperous restfulness and security rooted deeply in the earth that she found charming \u2014 for a fort night. She liked to walk with Frank under his spreading trees, and call up faint visions of wives and sisters of bygone squires, who had known those great trunks as slender saplings, and lived and died under their gradually widening shadows. She could even find names for a few of these phantoms, for she had been to the neat little church (Frank's father had restored it), and had seen their monuments, with urns, and cherubs, and festoons of marble drapery, upon the walls. It was strange to look at Frank, with the sunshine glancing through a little lancet window on his head, and to think that he too would have a tablet on these neat cold walls one clay, and that other guests would stay at the Hall, and come on Sun days and study it during service time. Frank, at her elbow, read the responses, with a conscious ness of his importance to the Established Church,"], [18, "8 MES. AUSTIN in which might have been absurd if it had not been so simple and honest. He sat through the sermon in an attitude expressive of deeper interest than Mrs. Austin found practicable. How was she to know that the whole of that discourse, as the young man heard it, was about herself? For her own part, she had dreams, but, less happy than Frank, her dreams were of the past instead of the future. When Gilbert South had asked her if she remembered the old time at West Hill, she had answered, \" Perfectly.\" It was quite true ; the picture was there, but it had not been called up for years as his words called it up. Even when he did not speak, the knowledge that it was continually in his thoughts seemed to give it a kind of independent existence. Mrs. Austin found herself recalling it in idle moments, and dwelling on all manner of little incidents and details wliich had been thrust into the background by later events. The old house and garden rose up before her as she knew them in her childish days ; the gateway hung with ivy, the apple-tree,"], [19, "\"1 MRS. AUSTIN 9 under her bedroom window, warped, and leaning away from the strong west winds ; the countless blossoms of narcissus and daffodil in early spring. She remembered the hoarse roar of the sea as she lay in bed on stormy nights, the shrieking of the hurrying gusts, the fierce lashing of the driven drops upon the pane, and then the stillness and the rain-washed sweetness of the morning when she wroke. It all came back to her, even to the tufts of fern, and the small green leaf-cups grow ing on the garden wall ; but it came back with that peculiar charm of tender remembrance which, combining many impressions of that which we have lost, creates one more beautiful than all. She saw it with a deeper colour in the sea, a wilder splendour of sunsets, a pearly clearness in the morning sky, and a wonderful purity in the lucid depths of air. More than once since she came to Culverdale it had chanced to her, failing asleep at night, while poor Frank was seeking his fortune in the stars, to dream that she saw Gilbert coming towards her along the grassy path. It"], [20, "10 MES. AUSTIN in was almost impossible to wake from such a dream, aud not to look with curious interest at the real man when he came down to breakfast. With all these preoccupations it was hardly surprising that Mrs. Austin did not give much thought to Tiny Vivian, beyond a vague and general goodwill, which the girl did not return. Tiny had never changed her mind about Mrs. Austin. \" I said I shouldn't like her, and I don't,\" she triumphantly repeated one day as she stood talking to Frank. \" It's a fine thing to be consistent, isn't it ? said Frank drily. \" It's much better than changing one's mind for ever. I can't see anything so very wonderful about her. Of course she has been good-looking, but so have lots of people, according to what they say. And anybody might talk in that affected way, as if her words were much more precious than anybody else's. It makes me cross.\" \" So I see.\" \" I could talk like that, and walk like that"], [21, "11 in MRS. AUSTIN too ! Look here.\" And Tiny swept round the room in an imitation of Mrs. Austin, which would have been very tolerable to anybody but Frank. \"Oh, of course!\" he said. \"That's always the way. Let one woman get hold of another, and one knows what to expect.\" \" And pray what does one expect ? \"Well, neither justice nor mercy. I suppose you can't help it.\" \" Oh, indeed ! \" said Tiny. \" Then I should like to know what Mrs. Austin says of me ! \" \" As far as I know she doesn't say anything,\" he answered coolly. Tiny was pained at Frank's manner, but she looked him in the face and smiled only the more resolutely. \" No,\" she said, \" of course she doesn't. That's just what I say. She's awfully stuck up and cold. I can quite understand her jilting Mr. South.\" \" How do you know she did jilt Mr. South ? \" he inquired in an irritating tone. \" Why, Frank, didn't she go and marry that"], [22, "12 MES. AUSTIN III other man? Of course she jilted him, and she'd do it again just as likely as not, only I hope he won't give her the chance. He's worth fifty of her ! Oh my goodness ! \" Tiny exclaimed with a burst of defiant laughter, \"what a regiment that would be !\" It was quite right that Tiny should speak up for Mr. South, since but for him she would have stood a chance of being somewhat neglected. Gilbert, however, would not suffer that. Apart from the fact that he found Tiny very fascinating, with her great eager eyes, her quick smiles, and the supreme charm of being still in her teens, he could never endure to see any one slighted. His nature was sweet and -kindly to the core, and he was always ready to give the sympathy, which, to say the truth, he required rather lavishly. He liked to talk about himself in tones of confidential melancholy, slightly dashed with bitterness. But he would talk to you just as readily about your self, showing a gentle warmth of interest wliich was flattering and agreeable. This kind of thing was new to Tiny. Frank was not in the habit of"], [23, "13 Ill MRS. AUSTIN saying much about his inner feelings, and certainly would not have known what to make of Tiny's if she had attempted to express them. Perhaps the girl had been less conscious of having such feelings to express before Mr. South came. It was new to her, too, being accustomed to play a subordinate part, in consequence of youth and inexperience, to meet with some one who considered youthful impressions of far greater value than the dull and blunted opinions of middle age. The squires and rectors about Culverdale did not express such views, nor did their wives and daughters set such value on the artless ideas of a girl who had been nowhere and known nobody. Tiny in a simple unthinking way had loved the country lanes and meadows among which she had been brought up, but with Mr. South's arrival came a quickened consciousness of their beauty and of her feelings about them. She was already a little less simple in consequence of his worship of simplicity, and her great brown eyes were more eager, and some times more thoughtful."], [24, "14 MES. AUSTIN in The time passed on till Mrs. Austin's visit was within three days of its close. She was to leave Culverdale on the Thursday, and this was the Monday evening, when a garden-party at the house of some friends of the Leicesters ended in an impromptu dance. Gilbert came up to her as she sat fanning herself, and watching the revolving couples. She shook her head in answer to his request. \"Don't ask me,\" she said. \"I haven't danced for years.\" And she glanced, not without a touch of amusement, at Frank, who had already been rejected, and who stood a little way off, very erect and melancholy. \"Why not?\" said Gilbert. \" My dancing days are over,\" she replied simply. \" Go and dance with some of these young people. I see plenty of pretty girls who will be quite ready for a new partner.\" He neither moved nor answered, and she turned her head and looked up at him from her low chair. He stood by her side with downcast eyes, pulling his moustache with what would have looked"], [25, "15 Ill MRS. AUSTIN almost like an air of irritation, if she had not known that he was never really out of temper. His expression and attitude reminded her of old days, when he was apt to be offended for a moment because some one had laughed at him, and he never liked to be laughed at. But after a brief pause she looked at him more attentively. Old use had taught her to read Gilbert's face like an open book, more readily than any other face on earth, yet there was something perplexing in it now. Did he care so much to dance with her ? She leaned back and waited, knowing that he was sure to speak before long. \" It is always the same thing,\" he said presently. \" This is over, and that is over. And when I remember you everything was just beginning.\" \" But that was a long while ago \u2014 as I think we have frequently remarked.\" Gilbert's eyes were fixed on a bit of scarlet geranium which had fallen on the floor. \"Yes,\" he said, \" I have missed everything somehow.\" \" One would think you wrere a second Eip van"], [26, "16 MES. AUSTIN in Winkle, you seem to find it so hard to realise the lapse of time. You haven't by chance been asleep for a dozen years or so, have you ?\" \" Upon my word I don't know. I think perhaps I may have been.\" He moved the bit of red blossom with his foot, and studied it under its new aspect. \" Asleep and dreaming perhaps,\" he said in a low voice. \" Well,\" Mrs. Austin replied, \" as far as I am concerned there is no great difficulty. Since you know the year in which I was born, you have only to buy an almanac, or to look at the top of a newspaper, and I think you will be able to calculate that I am thirty-seven.\" \" Oh, I know that very well. You will not let me forget it.\" \" Will not let you forget it ? Could you forget it if I would let you ?\" \" No,\" said South, lowering his voice still more. \" I don't suppose I could. I have learnt my lesson, I think. But I can swear to you that I never remembered it till you taught me.\""], [27, "17 Ill MRS. AUSTIN The music stopped abruptly as he spoke, and seemed to make a sudden vacancy in the air, into which there poured a confused murmur of voices and sweeping of dresses as the dancers strolled by. Among them, with a carmine flush on her soft brown cheek, went Tiny Vivian, and raised her long lashes for one brilliant glance as she passed. \" Miss Vivian looks especially well to-night,\" Mrs. Austin remarked, looking after her, and Gilbert murmured some reply, but the expression which had perplexed his companion deepened on his face. Her attention was distracted for a moment by the arrival of the master of the house, a stout white-whiskered old gentleman, who benignantly expressed the opinion that it was a pleasant sight to see the young people enjoying themselves. When she had agreed with him as completely as he could wish, she looked quickly round, but the tall figure had vanished from her side. He had gone away to follow once more a use less round of thought which had grown drearily VOL. II. c"], [28, "18 MRS. AUSTIN in familiar to him of late. He was haunted by the memories which he had called up. He had tried to bring them to life again, and instead they flitted round him like mocking ghosts, to be seen but never to be touched. Those happy clays in Cornwall were like the opening of a poem, but it had ended in the flattest and feeblest prose. At twenty he was to have been a hero, at thirty-nine he was nothing, and he knew that he never would be anything. The experience was not re markable, but in most cases the contrast is rendered endurable by the gentle influence of time. We become accustomed to it before it is so terribly defined, and half-forget the splendour of the starting-point before we reach the pitiful goal. But South was not so fortunate. He saw them both, and saw them always, in Mildred's eyes. As he stood by the door gazing idly round, his glance suddenly encountered Tiny Vivian's. She looked at him as if she dimly divined his trouble, but turned away her head the moment he noticed"], [29, "19 Ill MRS. AUSTIN her, and yet that swift glance, with its vague proffer of sympathy, came like a ray of light into his dull perplexity.

The weather may have something to do with it, but the chill is within us as well as without, and the outward aspect of things can only emphasise its dreariness. Something of the kind befell the inhabitants of the Manor House on the Tuesday morning. Every one was dull, the sky was clouded, and the world seemed to have grown old. Gilbert South had a harassed and weary expression, Tiny owned to a headache, Mrs. Leicester was worried by the knowledge that fifteen people were coming to dinner, and that she must keep awake all the"], [31, "21 IV MRS. AUSTIN evening, and Frank was conscious of nothing but the shadow of Mrs. Austin's approaching departure. Mrs. Austin herself was inclined to think that she had had more than enough of Culverdale. She had never known a place which depended so much on the sunshine for what beauty it possessed, and, in the uniformly diffused shadow, the low-lying park and the meadows with their lines of hedge and ditch oppressed her with a sense of unendurable monotony. There was really nothing to distinguish one enclosure from another, unless it were the presence of cows or sheep. One would have said that the soil of Frank's inheritance was heavy with the dulness of many generations, which rose on sunless days like an exhalation, not precisely poisonous, since good family feelings and respect able virtues would take no harm in it, but far too dense for winged and delicate fancies. Conse quently there was no chance of escaping from it even in thought. In truth there seemed no limit to its influence. Mrs. Austin, while she dressed, looked across the river to the village, and saw how"], [32, "22 MES. AUSTIN IV the church stood solidly planted among its white gravestones, and pointed with a sharp little spire to a gray and dreary region on high. It was hardly an encouraging prospect. Frank, poor fellow, suffered from her depres sion. He was too closely connected with his sur roundings to be a congenial companion on such a day ; his acres burdened him and dragged him down, and he found her not unkind, but languid and cold. Gilbert South might perhaps have called up other scenes and times by the mere sound of his voice, but he was silent at breakfast time, and disappeared almost immediately after wards. It was vaguely understood that he had important letters to write. And, after all, Mrs. Austin was not very sure that she needed any company. As she sat in the drawing-room, turn ing the pages of a novel as an excuse for silence, she half -unconsciously followed a thread of thought which stretched backward to her girlish days and onward to her future. She was still pursuing it in the afternoon when she drove with Tiny"], [33, "23 IV MRS. AUSTIN Vivian to the neighbouring town to make some purchases for Mrs. Leicester. The little town remained in her memory as a picture, as places sometimes do, which, being seen but once, in one mood and under one aspect, are not blurred and confused by conflicting impressions. The sullen clouds were as much a part of it as the foot-worn pavement, and a man with an organ> grinding a tune which had been popular a season or two before, was just as important as the vicar who went by with a bundle of little tracts and bowed to Miss Vivian. The carriage stopped and went on as Tiny directed, the tradesmen started out of their shops as if somebody had pulled a string, and stood bareheaded and smiling at the door while she consulted Mrs. Leicester's Est of commissions. At one place she went in, and Mrs_ Austin was left alone in a little square. The Town Hall was there, erected mdcccxliil, and there also was a drinking-fountam with an inscription which she could not read. The great clock over head struck four Eke a knell, and startled her just"], [34, "24 MES. AUSTIN IV as she was thinking that Gilbert South certainly was not a hero, and yet \u2014 \u2014 And a moment later Tiny came out and said \" Home \" to the coachman. They did not talk much as they drove back. When the lodge-keeper swung the gate open at the sound of their approach, it occurred to Mrs. Austin to wonder what Tiny had been thinking about so intently all the time. That evening, after dinner, South came to her, and stood for a few minutes turning over some photographs which lay at her elbow. One of them was of a place which he knew and she did not, and in answer to a question of hers he de scribed it. He pressed his hand on the table as he spoke, and a white scar across one of his fingers stood out more prominently and caught Mrs. Austin's eye. \" That cut of yours left a mark,\" she said, when he had finished. \" How frightened I was \u2014 do you remember ?\" Gilbert looked first at his hand and then at her with a strange, startled expression, almost as if he"], [35, "Iv MRS. AUSTIN 25 felt a throb of pain in his old wound. \" Yes,\" he said, \" I remember.\" And all at once the colour came into his face as if he were a boy again. \" I was cutting a stick for your brother Jack,\" he added hurriedly, \"and the knife slipped. Your mother tied it up for me.\" \" Yes, we found her in her storeroom. I think Jack thought you were going to die.\" Mrs Austin, for a moment, instead of seeing seven or eight country gentlemen, most of them bald, and as many ladies, grouped in the Culverdale drawing room, saw a sunshiny room, full of shelves and cupboards and boxes, where her mother, with capable hands, was bandaging that finger of Gilbert's, while Jack (poor fellow ! he died at school) stood looking on, scared at first, and then, when he found that mother could set it all right, a Httle aggrieved because after all he hadn't got his stick. Oh, how long ago it all was, and how sadly the old home was broken up ! She would have liked to take Gilbert's left hand in hers and hold it, just for the sake of that little scar and the"], [36, "26 MRS. AUSTIN IV dear people who were dead. And how deeply the memory of that time touched him ! Why did he colour up so suddenly at her question and turn away? Was there something special about this one incident? All at once it struck her that hitherto it had been Gilbert, and not she, who had said \"Do you remember?\" Was he so pleased that she should say it ? She recollected, too, that it was while he still had his hand bandaged that he spoke to her one evening by the white roses, and she promised to wait for him till he should come back to the old home. Perhaps that remem brance had caUed up his blush. Poor Gilbert, could he never forget his boyish inconstancy . Mrs. Leicester heaved a deep sigh of relief when her guests were gone. \"Dear me!\" she said suddenly to Mrs. Austin, \"is to-morrow really your last day with us ? What are you all going to do to-morrow ? \" There was a pause. \" Are not we going to row down the river to some farmhouse ?\" Mrs. Austin inquired, looking round."], [37, "IV MRS. AUSTIN 27 \" To old Green's,\" said Frank. \"Speak for yourself, my dear,\" said Mrs. Leicester, laughing and nodding. \" You don't catch me rowing down rivers. I shall have to die some day, I suppose, but there are plenty of ways of doing it without being drowned.\" \"Drowned?\" Mrs. Austin repeated, with a glance at Frank. \" My mother wouldn't venture on a ditch in a lifeboat without making her will and saying good bye to me,\" he answered. \"No,\" Mrs. Leicester rephed, in a tone of cheerful assent. \" I'm a coward about the water.

But Gilbert, while he professed his dehghted readiness to go anywhere or do any thing, had not the slightest intention of proposing to make one of the water party. He was convinced that it would be fraught with peril \u2014 for him. \" That hot-headed boy would certainly do his best to upset me into the river if I interfered with his arrangements,\" he said to himself. \" If he could contrive to give me a ducking, without splashing her, it would fill his soul with pure delight.\" Gilbert thought he would caU on old Mrs. Carleton, who was unlikely to indulge in any such pranks. Mrs. Leicester was really sorry that she was obliged to break up the party on this last day."], [40, "30 MRS. AUSTIN IV She could not see for her part why Mildred and Mr. South had not settled matters a week ago, and enjoyed themselves comfortably as an engaged couple, taking their share of privileges and joking remarks. But she supposed it was to be put off tiU the end of Mildred's visit, and she was anxious to give Gilbert a chance of coming to the point. She had noticed that Frank seemed to prefer Mrs. Austin to Mr. South, and was inclined to bestow the attention which should have been divided between his guests entirely on her. Frank was inconsiderate at times, but she would give him a quiet hint to leave the two to themselves when they came back from their respective expeditions. Gilbert South, unconscious of her beneficent schemes, woke the next morning to a dreary certainty that his visit to Culverdale had been a mistake from first to last. For years he had remembered Mddred Fairfax as the truest, the most loving, the most beautiful of womankind.

But for his own part, Gilbert, had he known her intentions, instead of gratefuUy blessing good Mrs. Leicester, would rather have been inclined to complain to her, very ungratefully and un justly, \" You have \" Unsettled the pure picture in my mind ; A girl, she was so perfect, so distinct.

We expect too much. No sympathy is so perfect as that which we imagine. And Gilbert South had been especially fanciful and dreamy in his re collections. He had had, as it were, just a glimpse of Mildred's pure, girlish love, and then he had been drawn away by a woman older than himself who wanted a little amusement. He had been made a fool of, coarsely, by a practised flirt. Afterwards he attempted to go back ; he wrote a dozen letters of explanation and repentance, and of course sent off the worst.

She had trusted him and he had failed her; the pain had been keen, but with a touch of scorn in it. And later, when the wound was healed and aU bitterness gone, she thought of him, not unkindly, but as one whose nature was light and fickle. When she discovered how constantly he had looked back to that old love which she supposed was utterly forgotten, her memory awoke hke the autumn blossoming of spring flowers. On that last day all the interest seemed to be concentrated on the water expedition, as if it were indeed a voyage of vast importance.

The dull gray surface, with its floating leaves and its grasses drawn by the silent current, was shaded by great groups of trees, whose dusky greenness was lighted here and there by gleams of autumn yellow. Mrs. Austin did not move, no breath of wind stirred the dark masses of foliage overhead ; it was like a picture with something of melancholy stateliness about it. When Frank was ready the solitary figure dis appeared from the bank, and they went gliding from under the shadow of the trees out into the wide, sunless fields. Honestly, it was not a very beautiful scene. To Frank, who had known it aU his life, the ques tion of its beauty or ugliness did not occur ; it"], [45, "V MRS. AUSTIN 35 was simply the river, and as such it had moulded his conception of all rivers. On its dull waters such childish dreams as he had known had em barked and set sail. As a boy he had fished there, just as four or five urchins were fishing now. They stared, open-mouthed and silent, at young Mr. Leicester and his boat, but took no notice of the lady who looked with a musing smile at the little rustic group as she went by. Presently came a curve in the stream, where a clump of alders grew, and bushes leaned despondently over the water which was eating the earth away from their roots. The more distant prospect showed a monotonous variety of ploughed land and pasture, with lines of trees following the hedges, and here and there a cottage or two and a bit of road. Mrs. Austin and Frank talked as they went. He told her how one bitter winter the river was frozen, and he skated to the farm where they were going now. He pointed out a lonely house, and spoke of the people who lived there. He showed her how far the floods had reached in a wet season,"], [46, "36 MRS. AUSTIN IV a muddy expanse in which little files of cropped willows seemed to wade knee-deep, and the water washed through the gates of lost meadows. And he broke off suddenly in the midst of what he was saying to ask, \"Where shaE you be this time to morrow?\" \" Half-way to London, I should think,\" she answered ; \" I don't know how long the journey takes.\" Frank looked at her and was silent. He wondered whether he should speak as they came back. The Greens' house stood by the roadside a little way from the river. The farm-buildings and some big stacks had a pleasant prosperous air, but the house itself was an ugly httle plastered box, with a bit of treeless garden in front, blossoming with prim sulphur-coloured dahlias. Frank did not seem to have much to say to old Green after all. The two exchanged a few words and then came to the little parlour, where Mrs. Austin sat on a horsehair sofa giving the latest news of"], [47, "37 iv MRS. AUSTIN Mrs. Leicester and Miss Vivian to the farmer's wife. Frank was on very pleasant terms with his tenants, who evidently thought their young land lord a most important personage. Other people were \"high,\" but vaguely \"high,\" and a duke would not have impressed Mrs. Green as much as Mr. Leicester from the Manor House. The Prince of Wales, perhaps, as a young man residing in palaces, and holding a well-defined position as the Queen's son, might have eclipsed Frank, but it would have taken a prince to do it. Mrs. Austin perceived, with a shght smile, how unimportant she was compared with her companion, but she was not in a mood to be amused by that or anything else that afternoon. She was glad to leave the house, to escape from hospitable offers of cake and home made wine, and to find herself once more upon the road. Even then, however, the old farmer insisted that Frank should look at a shed which was not satisfactory, and she had to wait while the matter was discussed. There was a little pond with neat white railings"], [48, "38 MRS. AUSTIN IV just opposite the house, and she strolled across and stood by it with a mysterious sense of loneli ness and desolation upon her. StiE as the afternoon was, she fancied that there was a mournful little rustling in the boughs of a stunted oak which grew a few yards away. The little pool mirrored a vacant gray sky. It was absurd, and yet she felt as if she would have given anything to see Gilbert South coming towards her, instead of which it was Frank, who tore himself away from the farmer and darted across the road. \"I've kept you waiting,\" he said; \"I'm so sorry ! Oh, and you are tired, aren't you ?\" A little,\" she aUowed. \" Nothing to matter.\" \"It's too bad of me! What can I do?\" he exclaimed wuth anxious solicitude. \" Come in again and let Mrs. Green make you some tea.\" \" Oh no, no,\" she said. \" I would rather go back.\" Frank was in despair. He reproached hiniseff. '\u25a0' What a brute I am!\" Mrs. Austin fairly laughed at the intensity of"], [49, "39 IV MRS. AUSTIN his remorse. \" What would you do if I were very tired?\" she said. He hardly dared to speak to her as they went back, and perhaps it was owing to that enforced sUence that later he recaUed with especial vivid ness the plash of his oars on their quietly winding way, the Uttle ripples dying among the dry autumnal reeds on either bank, and the light from the west, where a pale sun struggled feebly through the clouds, falling coldly on the beautiful face before him. For Mrs. Austin, meanwhUe, a soft current of thought flowed with the river, setting ever more strongly towards a final resolu tion. If it rested with her to make GUbert South happy, why should she not do it ? He was not what she had once imagined him, yet he was truer and better than she had beUeved him during the years they had been parted.

If I had known that I might have wondered whether you were really going to drown me. But here we are, safely landed, in spite of our forebodings.\" He surveyed the sullen sky. \" Perhaps there's thunder in the air,\" he suggested. \" Perhaps. That might account for my feeling tired. I've been a duU companion, I fear.\" \"No,\" Frank was beginning to say, when he stopped short. They had just come in sight of the house, and he stared at a farmer's chaise, driven by a labouring man, which was going away"], [51, "MRS.

But oh, Frank !\" \" The horses ?\" said Frank, greatly relieved, \" Nothing much. Eobinson says it's quite wonderful. There's no harm done.\""], [53, "IV MRS. AUSTIN 43 \"What then?\" Frank grasped his mother's arm. \" There's something more. Tiny is hurt \u2014 I know she is. Why don't you say so ?\" \" No, she isn't ; she isn't indeed, nor Mr. South either.\" \" Well ? \" \"They are not hurt,\" said Mrs. Leicester desperately, \" but they're engaged to be married ! \" She looked as if she expected an explosion, hut none foUowed. Frank's hand unclosed and dropped by his side, and he stood for a moment staring dumbly at her. \" Are you sure you didn't fall out too, and pitch on your head?\" he said at last. \"No, indeed; I was in the cottage when the train came. Oh, it's quite true, Frank. You know I reaUy couldn't help it. Are you angry?\" \" Angry ?\" he repeated, \" why should I be angry ? I'm dreaming I think. It isn't a joke?\" he said suddenly with a threatening frown. \" No ! oh no ! Is it wrong, do you think ? What could I do ?\""], [54, "44 MRS. AUSTIN IV \"Tiny and South?\" said Frank. \"Tiny! Well \u2014 if she likes him ! I don't see why it should be wrong,\" he went on, bewildered, yet beginning to perceive how in some ways it might be marvel lously right. \" That's for her own people to decide.

But I don't seem able to believe it yet.\" \"Well, here is Mr. South,\" said Mrs. Leicester more cheerfully. \" Perhaps you'll believe him.\" Frank looked up and saw South coming across the grass. He was pale, but there was a peculiar brightness about his face. His eyes were shining, he smiled a little defiantly. Surprise is not the easiest thing in the world to encounter, especially if one is a little surprised at oneself. Gilbert had only just found himself out. Before Frank could take a step to meet him, Mrs. Austin, who had come up during the explanation, went forward swiftly aud held out her hand."], [55, "45 IV MRS. AUSTIN \"Gilbert, is this true?\" she said. \"I may congratulate you, not only on your fortunate escape, but on your engagement too ?\" (Mrs. Leicester in the background arched her eyebrows and looked at Frank. \" I had forgotten her!\" she whispered.) South ceased to smile, but he met her question ing eyes honestly enough. \" Yes,\" he said slowly, \"it's quite true.\" He looked at her as if he would have said more. \" Then I wish you all happiness \u2014 I wish it with all my heart,\" she rephed. There was no tremor in her soft clear voice. \" I think our old friendship gives me the right to be one of the first to congratulate you.\" \" Thank you,\" Gilbert rephed confusedly. He still held her hand, and looked anxiously at her as if he feared some hidden meaning in her words. \"Mildred!\" he said, and there was a world of pleading in his tone. \" Tell me \" he stopped short. What was he going to say ? \" Believe me,\" she said, and he felt her fingers"], [56, "46 MRS. AUSTIN IV tighten on his in a kindly clasp as she spoke, \" I have always wished your happiness \u2014 always. And I am glad to think that you have found it.\" And with that she nodded a smiling little farewell and walked towards the house. Gilbert gazed after her with a throb of regret ful pain. He had known that it was impossible to go back to the old days, Mildred had taught him that. And yet as he looked over his shoulder at her retreating figure, he had a strange fancy that it was the very past itself, the past which he had so long worshipped and from which he had so suddenly awakened, which was at that moment leaving him for ever, a stately shape passing silently away and never looking back. He would not have recalled her, since he could not recall the Mildred who believed in him and looked at him with happy hope in her eyes. It was Tiny who believed in him now. Mildred had no need of him. Tiny had called to him, \" Gilbert!\" in their peril that afternoon, and his heart had answered the innocently appealing cry, the name by which"], [57, "47 IV MRS. AUSTIN she had never called him, uttered as her one word then. Tiny had no need to grudge his old love that one backward glance. It was all over in a moment, and Gilbert drew a long breath, and went forward to receive Frank's congratulations. They were rather briefly and bluntly given. Frank was eager to be gone ; the picture which for Gilbert personified a softly sentimental regret was for him a vision of hope which beckoned him to follow. He uttered such good wishes as came readily to his lips, and were suitable to anybody who was going to be married. He realised the accident by the gravel-pit more clearly than the engagement, but he was too impatient and pre occupied to talk much even about that. \" It's a mercy you weren't killed !\" he said shortly. \" Well, I suppose it was a narrow escape,\" Gil bert answered with a smile. \" A narrow escape \u2014 yes, I should think so. It couldn't very well have been much narrower, as far as I can see. However, a miss is as good as a mile, I suppose.\""], [58, "48 MRS. AUSTIN iv \" So they say,\" Gilbert rephed ; \" but, for my own part, I should prefer the mile next time. And so would your cousin, I fancy.\" \" Ah, Tiny knew what you were coming to ! It's no wonder if she was scared, poor child !\" said Frank. \"There isn't a nastier place about here. By the way, I haven't seen Tiny yet.\" And he brushed past Gilbert and departed, as if to con gratulate Tiny were the one object of life. He went by the stable-yard, where he speedily ascertained that the amount of damage done was so absurdly small that there was nothing serious about the whole business, except what might have been. He cut Robinson's explanations short, and hurried to the house, where, as luck would have it, he met Tiny in the hall. She looked a little like Gilbert South, pale with agitation, and yet radiant. Her great brown eyes were shining, and her lips quivered with excitement which might end either in sobs or smiles. \"Oh, Frank,\" she exclaimed ; and she too looked up anxiously to see how the young master received the news."], [59, "IV MRS. AUSTIN 49 \"Well,\" said he, taking her hands in his; \" this is a pretty afternoon's work ! What will your people at home say, do you suppose ? \" \" Oh, my people at home ! They'll say what I say,\" Tiny answered, with a tremulous laugh. \" I shall make them.\" \" And what do you say ?\" \" Oh, Frank ! isn't it strange ? I'm so glad, but I want you to say you are glad too. Frank, you do like him now, don't you ? You are not vexed ?\" \" No, I'm not vexed if you are happy. Oh, I like him well enough. But I think you ought to have had somebody younger,\" he said doubtfully. \" Oh no, Frank,\" Tiny rephed, with great decision. \"It doesn't matter the least bit when it's the man. If it were the woman, now, it would matter ; but not when it's the man.\" \" Well, you know best.\" And Frank released one of his hands. \" I'm sure I wish you all happi ness. It comes rather suddenly,\" he said, with a laugh. \" So it did to me,\" Tiny replied ; \" and I'm not VOL. II. E"], [60, "50 MRS.

He smelt hke a Sunday school nosegay as we were coming back ; but he says he shall always like it now.\" The sight of Tiny, ahve, laughing, and talking nonsense with quivering lips, suddenly brought the thought of her peril vividly before Frank. \" Oh, Tiny !\" he said, \" you might have been killed !\""], [61, "MRS. AUSTIN 51 IV \" Don't,\" she said ; \" I saw it all \u2014 the gravel pit, you know, just as we went down into it one day ; do you remember ? Ever so long ago, almost the first time I stayed here. I saw it all, as if there were a terrible hght in it, and I said to my self, ' I shall die there ! ' And then I called to Gilbert, and I remember his face for one moment, and we got to the turning, and before we could jump out it was all over; and there we were, picking ourselves up, and none the worse !\" \"Thank God !\" said Frank. \" Only so dusty ; and somehow I felt very small when I found it had all ended in nothing at all.\" Frank laughed. \"Never mind; it was better than being a smashed heroine.\" \"And it has ended in something, only a different sort of thing, hasn't it?\" said Tiny. \"Where is everybody, Frank? In the drawing room ?\" \" Everybody ? No ; I left him with my mother on the lawn.\" Tiny made a face at him. \" Oh, by the way, I"], [62, "52 MRS. AUSTIN IV know Mrs. Austin isn't there. I met her a minute ago on the stairs, and she kissed me and congratu lated me. I say, who told her?\" \" She heard my mother telling me, I believe.\" \" Oh, I wondered if Gilbert had. Do you suppose she minds much ? \" \" I don't believe she minds at all,\" said Frank. '' Why should she ? She told him she was very glad.\" \" I believe she does mind, though,\" Tiny nodded. \" She was very fond of talking about old times.\" \" Rubbish ! \" Frank exclaimed ; \" you're as bad as my mother ! \" and he walked off, leaving Tiny happily convinced that it was impossible Mrs. Austin should not envy her the possession of Gilbert's love. \" Now or never !\" he said to himself as he went slowly up the stairs. His life hung in the balance, his heart was beating fast, and every throb brought him nearer the decisive moment. He turned into a little room where Mrs. Leicester and Tiny some times sat. He would lie iu wait for Mrs. Austin"], [63, "iv MRS. AUSTIN 53 there, she must pass the door as she went down. Frank leant against the window, looking at the dim undulations of the landscape, and vaguely recognising familiar points. It was strange to stand in that little room which he had known all his life \u2014 he could remember learning his lessons there at his mother's knee \u2014 waiting for his fate to come to him. At any moment it might come, with a quiet step, and the soft sweeping of her dress in the passage. Before a dozen more of those strong heart-throbs were over her eyes might be meeting his. She would look him in the face he knew, but what would she say to him ? Frank had never thought less of himself than he did at that moment, and yet beneath all his anxiety he had an unreasoning faith in his good luck. Fortune had always been kind to him ; people had always done what he wanted them to do. Yes, but Mrs. Austin was different. He dared not hope, and yet the mere thought that success was possible flushed him like a draught of wine. Then she"], [64, "54 MRS. AUSTIN IV would not be Mrs. Austin but \u2014 Mildred ; he would not have to count days and nights as steps towards parting, they would all be his, other people would come and go, but she would stay. When she said \" home \" she would mean Culverdale. On that last thought he dwelt with exquisite dehght, as if he could hear her uttering the word. It was the wildest dream, yet in a few minutes that dream might be his actual life ; that was the wonder of it. And was not fortune smiling on him already ? He had been afraid of Gilbert South, he had had misgivings about Tiny's troubled eyes, and now just at the right moment all his doubts and fears had vanished away, he was free to go to his love, and she was free to come to him. There could be no shadow of reproach or regret between them. He heard her footfall in the passage, he called \" Mrs. Austin ! \" it paused, and she appeared on the threshold of the open door. He had been expecting her and watching for her, and yet when she came in answer to his call he felt as if he"], [65, "55 IV MRS. AUSTIN were taken by surprise and had not a word to say. She stood in the doorway waiting for him to speak, and on her delicate lips was that faint half-smile which seemed to Frank to be the sum of all the poetry in the world. \" What is it ? \" she said. \" Did you want me ? \" \"Don't go down for a few minutes,\" he entreated. \" I have something to say to you.\" She looked unsuspectingly at him. \" Some other time,\" she said ; \" I really must go to your mother.\" \" My mother ?

Even as he looked at her pale, startled face, before she had opened her lips to answer him, he knew that he had failed.

But all at once he"], [66, "56 MRS.

I'm more sorry than words can say if anything I have said or done \" \"No!\" Frank exclaimed. \"You have done nothing wrong.

But it was only a passing thought. Something told her that Frank, as he spoke, touched the highest point of which he was capable. It might be that he too felt that at that moment the flood of passion and resolution reached its limit, but he beheved that the wave, if not repulsed, would have force enough to carry him onward through the lower waters of his later life. \"I think you are good for a great deal,\" she said, \"but that isn't the question.

The eager expression died out of his eyes and his face relaxed. \" Very well,\" he said. \" Then I suppose there's nothing to do but to say good-bye.\" He seemed to be making an effort to master him self, and Mrs. Austin looked aside at the window and waited till he should speak again. \" See here,\" he said, after a brief sdence, \" I shall tell my mother I have to go up to town on business this evening, but that I'm coming down to-morrow morning.

That is possible of course.\" Mrs. Austin was a httle puzzled by his manner. The colour deepened on his face. \" Well,\" he said, \" why should we ?

The entreaty, \" Let me remem ber you as you are,\" touched her strangely. She knew that she was beautiful, but she knew also that her beauty was on the wane, and there was"], [71, "61 IV MRS. AUSTIN a melancholy pleasure in the thought that, though for the world she might grow old, for this one man she should always remain such as she was at that moment of farewell. She could not marry him, she did not love him, but womanlike she did desire to be always young for her young lover. She desired it too for her own sake. Otherwise it seemed to her that the mere lapse of a few years might turn Frank's passionate devotion and her answering pity into a ridiculous joke. If she were a faded elderly woman and he a heavy re spectable squire, would it be possible to remember without laughter that they had ever felt and spoken as they were feeling and speaking then ? Why should not Frank have his way, foolish and boyish though it might be ? \" Let it be so, then,\" she said. \" If you hke it best, we will say ' Good-bye ' here and now.\" She looked at him very sadly. \" I wish I had never come here.\" \"No, no!\" cried Frank, with sudden passion, almost as if he thought that her wish could really"], [72, "62 MRS.

Near the fireside sat a woman, who, reckoning by years, should have been young, but who was faded, hopeless, and worn out.

She was an empty headed girl whose life had been made dreary by poverty and family pride. The Vaughans had great relations but the smaUest of incomes, and Fanny's Use was as rigidly ruled as if she were a princess, and as narrow as if she were a nun. She fancied herself in love with young Fletcher, and she escaped from the tyranny of her mother and brother to marry him.

He was extravagant; he neglected his business, his foreman cheated him, he took to billiards at the Red Lion, and went headlong to bankruptcy. His wife sat at home, crushed and Ustless, rousing herself only from time to time to write letters to her brother Ernest. She tried to make them eloquent and pathetic.

There was a faint sound like a far-off cry. \" 'Tisn't your baby \u2014 it's a child in the street,\" said a rough boyish voice. And a repetition of the sound proved the speaker to be right.

Perhaps in her frank humility she thought his ambition nobler than it was. As for Ernest, he did not doubt for a moment that her desires were the same as his own. It had been easy to deceive Selina and CaroUne in the matter of his love. They would often ask Lizzie to tea, because she was a capital amateur dressmaker, and had ingenious ideas which would make their frayed and faded garments look as good as new. On these occasions Ernest would wear a lowering face, for he hated to see his love stooping over Selina's dingy finery, planning and turning, with pins in her mouth. But his aunts misunderstood his ill-temper, and chose to imagine that he despised Lizzie Grey, because her father, dead some three years earlier, had been only a superintendent of police.

Ernest loved it because one day he rescued it from some boys, who were stoning the helpless vindictive beast in a corner.

Already his aunts wondered why \" that horrid cat \" was so often about the place, and Miss Sehna or Miss Caroline, perceiving it, would fly out with \" Ssh \u2014 you nasty beast \u2014 you!\" or Dorcas would pursue it with a shower of small stones, and the hunted wretch would scramble over the wall, turning at a safe distance to spit and growl in venomous impotence like a decrepit fiend. Ernest mean while stood by, fully aware of his favourite's repulsive appearance, but with disgust swaUowed up in pity for its bleak and starved existence. StiU he was sore, not because Sandy was ugly and malignant, but because he fancied it was ridiculous to protect an old cat. \" It was his usual luck,\" he grumbled to himself.

He wondered, too, why his Aunt Sehna's thimble and needle clicked at every stitch she took, whde his Aunt Caroline's didn't. Only Aunt Caroline had a trick of sniffing at irregular intervals, and Ernest was not quite certain whether the regular click of thimble and needle, though it worried him almost to distraction, was worse than the horrible suspense caused by the irregularity of Aunt Caroline's sniffing.

Ernest's eyes were bright with a scarcely acknowledged hope as he pushed the door open and went in. A big fair man stood on the rug, his head thrown back with a defiant air.

Miss Selina read it with an air of mystery, nodded to Miss Caroline, and went out. Ernest, going weardy upstairs, met her, and was informed that Miss Grey was coming to tea. He stopped short, and his angry scowl might well confirm her in the idea that he dis-"], [110, "100 LIZZIE'S BARGAIN I liked Lizzie. \" Have you any objection, pray ?\" she inquired. \"What does it matter?\" he said in a half choked voice. He brushed past her, and raced upstairs, furious at the thought that Lizzie \u2014 his Lizzie \u2014 should have been sent for to amuse a vulgar tradesman. He dashed into his room, scaring poor Sandy, who had crept in at the win dow and was crouching in a corner. His frenzy was over in a moment, and he caught up his favourite, fondling it with a patient tenderness. Lizzie would have liked to see the smile which lighted his dark face, and glanced, like sunshine on suUen waters, from his melancholy eyes. He was unwilling to put Sandy down. And why should he ? He was not going to take any trouble to do honour to Theophdus Fletcher. So when at last he saw fit to go downstairs he had done little to improve his personal appearance. Not so the other. Whether on account of the coming visitor, or merely from his habit of neglecting no advantage which he might possess,"], [111, "lizzie's bargain 101 I Mr. Theophilus Fletcher had dressed very care fully indeed. Ernest, lounging in in his shabby morning coat, found his uncle looking very new and resplendent, and occupying his favourite posi tion on the rug, while Miss Selina, in her Sunday cap, chattered about Lizzie Grey. \" A reaUy charming girl, Theophilus ; so pretty, and so unaffected \u2014 oh, you needn't look at Ernest \u2014 Ernest doesn't Uke her \u2014 her father was only a superintendent of police \u2014 very well for us, but not nearly grand enough for him, is she, Ernest ?

Ernest looked down and saw poor pussy's sandy hairs sprinkled thickly on his coat. \" You are just the young man to live with a couple of spinsters, aren't you?\" said Thorpe. A step was heard in the passage, and for the first time Ernest voluntarily met his uncle's eyes. \"Don't say anything, sir \u2014 they hate the poor brute. They'd hunt it \" \"Then be off and brush your coat,\" said the other. \" Their eyes mayn't be as sharp as mine \u2014 Caroline ought to wear spectacles, / know \u2014 but never count on a woman's not seeing what she isn't meant to see \u2014 mind that.\" Thorpe, left to himself, wondered why bis"], [113, "lizzie's bargain I 103 nephew should disUke Lizzie Grey. \" Cooped up here with Selina and Caroline, he ought to be ready to like anybody.

I wouldn't find fault with Miss Lizzie if she held my hand Uke that!\" The tea-party was a very cheerful one to all but Ernest.

Thorpe tried to draw his nephew into the conversation, but,"], [114, "104 lizzie's bargain I being peevishly repulsed, he turned away with a smde, and devoted himself to Miss Grey. Ernest looked on in angry astonishment. If it were intolerable that Lizzie should be sent for to amuse a bidlying overdressed tradesman, how infinitely worse to find her unconscious of her degradation ! Poor Lizzie ! She liked Mr. Fletcher, and had no idea that she ought to feel humiliated. She glanced at her lover from time to time as he sat apart, and thought that he looked Uke a prince in disguise; but she was forced to own that her prince was slovenly, out at elbows, moody, and deficient in princely courtesy. Why did he repulse his uncle ? Why should not his life be brightened by the broad glow of Mr. Fletcher's prosperity? And on Ernest's behalf she paid her innocent court to Theophdus. Miss Caroline's spirits rose to such an unusual height that, when the table was cleared, she pro posed to play cribbage with her brother, as she used to do with the schoolboy of twenty years earher. Thorpe assented, but when the cards"], [115, "I lizzie's bargain 105 were produced, he could not refrain from a startled aside \u2014 \" Same pack, by Jove !\" \u2014 and for a moment his brow was drawn down, and his under Up pushed out as of old. This man had no reverence for antiquity, and took no interest in the memorials of bygone centuries. But he was strangely im pressed by the accidental permanence of so perishable a thing as a pack of cards, and he cast a pitying glance at his sisters. His views of woman's rights and woman's needs were narrow enough. A woman should have a husband who would never loose his temper nor his authority, and who should provide her with a comfortable home, plenty to eat and drink, and a sufficiency of finery. But, as he shuffled the old cards, he woke to a sudden comprehension of the stagnant dreariness of his sisters' Uves. Twenty years earUer he had left that house to work his way to fortune. He had known many changes and many men. He had thrown himself, rejoicing in his strength, into the world's swift current, and was hurrying onward to success. And when he came"], [116, "106 lizzie's bargain I back to his old home he found no change there, except that of inevitable decay, and no idea of amusement for the man except the pack of cards with which the boy had played. But Caroline was waiting for him to begin, and he had no time for further thought. Apparently he had not become more skilful since their former encounters, and he soon leant back to show his cards to Miss Grey, as she sat by the fireside. While he dexterously balanced himself so as to bring his bold face and mirthful eyes very close to Lizzie, that she might give her counsel in a whisper, Ernest felt that he would cheerfully give all that he possessed \u2014 not much, poor feUow ! \u2014 to see the tilted chair shp, and tumble the self-possessed gentleman into the fender among the fire - irons. But it was not to be. And as Mr. Fletcher made outrageous blunders if left to himself for a moment, and Miss Caroline said, in a tone which was meant to be playful, \" I wonder you don't look after your pupil better than that, Lizzie, I do indeed,\" the"], [117, "lizzie's bargain 107 I girl, after a Uttle whde, drew her chair to the table, laid aside her work, and gave hersetf up to the game. She had enough to do, for Theophdus cheated unblushingly before his adversary's very eyes, and looked so coolly at Lizzie herself when he had rattled off, and was about to score, some astonishing miscalculation of his hand, that she could only reply with a glance of incredulous doubt, and, taking the cards from him, endeavour to point out his mistakes. But once in the midst of the demonstration she was suddenly aware of laughter lurking in his eyes, and, flinging down the cards she exclaimed, \" I won't say another word \u2014 you know it aU better than I do, and you cheat most abominably, Mr. Fletcher.\" But Thorpe explained how the truth had just dawned upon him, and he could not help laughing at his own stupidity. Lizzie shook her head, but at last she relented, and looked at the hand which had just been dealt to him. Presently Miss Selina hunted a black bottle of currant wine out of the cupboard, and caUed for a"], [118, "108 lizzie's bargain I corkscrew. Thorpe begged her not to open it on his account, as brandy and water would do for him. She however persisted, and hospitably poured it out.

She had but a moody companion. He abused Thorpe Fletcher's appearance, manners, coat, ring, and Albert chain, untd they reached her door. \" How we have wasted our time ! \" said Lizzie sadly, \" and I have so little time with you, Ernest.\" \" Let us go a little farther,\" he pleaded in sudden penitence.

There are some girls who fancy that every man they meet is dying for them. Lizzie was not one of these, but she did believe that Mr. Fletcher was in love with her. The very idea was terrible, and sent a flood of crimson to her cheeks ; yet what else could she think ? How otherwise could she account for his pursuit of her, for the questioning glances which sought an answer in her face ? More than once speech seemed so imminent that Lizzie held her breath in terror, and thought it miraculous that Ernest's suspicion had not as yet been aroused. Any moment might open his eyes, and concentrate his hatred on the man she had fondly hoped would be his benefactor. In fact his eyes must be opened before long, for even whde she tried to keep Theophilus at arm's length, to avoid his glance, the touch of his hand, or to escape when she saw him coming, she felt as if she were knotting cobweb fetters to restrain some great thick-skinned animal, who would be uncon scious of any bond.

And when she had rejected him everything would come out, and Ernest's prospects would be ruined. It was quite true that Mr. Fletcher had an interest in Lesborough besides the foundry. He had come to see what he could do for poor Fanny's boy. He said nothing of this to his sisters, who would never have understood his feelings towards his brother's wife. He hardly understood them himself. He had thought her a limp, faded, foolish woman ; he had seen no beauty in her, and yet she had awakened in his heart a pity in which scorn and kindness were curiously mixed ; a con temptuous fidelity which Uved when she was dead. Prosperous and practical though he was, there were times when he could almost have fancied that he felt those fingers, cold and dead a score of years, fluttering again at his heart, where once her letter lay.

His determination was only strengthened by the scowling glances and suUen words with which his advances were met. But he had not to deal with Ernest alone.

She arrived early one afternoon at Mrs. Croft's, flushed with the excitement of having caught but a distant glimpse of Mr. Fletcher on her way. She was received with the news of a hohday for her little scholars, their grandmamma having come unex pectedly and taken them out. Mrs. Croft, how ever, had no idea of losing Lizzie's services, and asked her if she would mind walking to a farm house about three miles off to give a message about some butter. No one could be spared to go, and if Miss Grey had no objection, as there were no lessons Miss Grey agreed at once, delighted to exchange the little schoolroom, which smelt of cheese, for the lonely road to Firwood Grange. In less than five minutes she was on her way. \" She grows prettier every day,\" said Mrs, Croft, looking after her. \" No need,\" said the grocer from behind his counter. \" Prettiest girl in Lesborough now.\" Mrs. Croft was right.

Lizzie had suc cessfully accomplished her errand, and was just starting on her homeward walk. She looked back as she closed the Uttle garden-gate, nodded a bright farewell to the farmer's wife, and turned into the road by a Uttle plantation of stunted firs, duskdy green amid the general leaflessness. She had a half-smile on her lips, for she was thinking how pleasant it would be if by a happy chance she should meet Ernest on her way, when a man who was lounging by a roadside gate, cigar in mouth, stepped forward and confronted her.

He was conscious at the same time of a certain brute-strength and tenacity which showed no symptom of failing him.

A little bit of jealousy might not be such a bad beginning, eh?\" Lizzie stared blankly at him for a moment. Then she crimsoned, tore her hand out of his grasp, and fled. Theophdus Fletcher was left on the old bridge. It may fairly be supposed that he was triumphant ; at any rate he was in possession of the battlefield, for through the wintry twilight was dimly visible a shm, graceful figure, flying in haste towards the twinkUng Lesborough lights, while another figure, also with his back towards the conquering hero, strode along the frozen river bank.

It was bad enough before with SeUna and Caroline, but his home Use had not altogether unfitted him to wage a womanish war of words, and they had no advan tage over him, except the possession of their small income, and the melancholy little house. But Theophilus took his stand upon the soUd ground of his success, and was not to be conquered with words. In that feminine household it had seemed"], [152, "142 LIZZIE'S BARGAIN in no disgrace to live from day to day in idleness ; but his uncle's presence reminded Ernest that he too was a man, with a man's inheritance of tod. Since the first night he had felt that heavy hand ever on his shoulder, impelling him towards the destiny he hated. Lizzie, timidly doubting what she could say to him, was assaded with a storm of reproaches. As in boddy pain Ernest might have bitten his lip, or clenched his hand, tdl the self-inflicted torment partially deadened the other, so his sombre irrita tion found some relief in making Lizzie a sharer of his suffering. For in his eyes she was one with himself, and he never dreamed that anything could part them. His attack was not altogether without cause, for Lizzie's apparent friendUness with the man he hated most on earth made his burden heavier to bear.

Did he not know that she would refute the accusation, and promise to have no more to do with the hated Theophdus ? Ten minutes later the pair stood with averted eyes, aghast and incredulous. Neither had ever reahsed the horror of the blow which had fallen upon them; they felt as two children might, if, being at play, they chanced to put out the sun in heaven. Ernest, instead of being caressed and soothed, had met with a swift and terrible reply, \"If you think so meanly of me, we had better part.\" Even then he could not think she meant what she said. He shifted his ground a little. \" Had he no cause for thinking so?\" he demanded. \" Cause ! \" she replied indignantly, while she struggled with the great lump which would come up in her throat at the thought of the pain she was inflicting. \" If you are capable of suspecting me \u2014 and it seems you are capable \u2014 it is enough, and more than enough ! \" As she uttered the words she felt that fortune had favoured her marveUously.

And Ernest remarked to himself, with a stab of despair, the intensity of the anger which almost choked her voice. \" I have offended her for ever,\" he thought, and he answered in a mood as desperate as her own. Not ten minutes and it was accomplished, this evil which could never be undone. No fidlest expression of penitence, no passionate kisses of reconcdiation, could efface the memory of this moment when they were two, when, though their bitter wounds were aching, they stood apart in their divided lives. If Lizzie had not understood this, she must have thrown herself at Ernest's feet to ask for pardon. \" But it would never be the same again ! \" she cried to herself. \" It would be worse than if I had never listened to Thorpe Fletcher. It is too late \u2014 too late \u2014 but why did God ever let him come ! \" Too late \u2014 she drew herself up, and stood with lips compressed and downcast eyes. Too late for Ernest also. He had gone so far"], [155, "Ill lizzie's bargain 145 that he did not know how to draw back. He would have given anything in reason \u2014 say all his life but just a quarter of an hour \u2014 to have undone the work of those few minutes and taken his love to his heart again. But he could not sacrifice his pride; so he too stood in gloomy sdence, stunned, and vaguely thinking what a merciful thing an earth quake would be, or any peril that might give him a chance of springing to Lizzie's side to die with her. But the lane at the bottom of the Misses Fletcher's garden, with a bit of orange peel and a little wisp of straw lying in the dust, and its dead waUs garnished with broken bottles, hardly seemed the place in which to hope for any startling deUver ance. None came, indeed. Only a boy appeared, wheeling a barrow, and whistling \"Beautiful Star.\" As he went by he looked up sideways, with impu dent curiosity, at the lady and gentleman who stood so sdently, a Uttle way apart, and was so much amused that he trundled his barrow as slowly as possible, while Ernest scowled at him.

And as I daresay we shan't meet for a long time, we might as well say good-bye.\" Startled, she raised her eyes, and never saw the tremulous hand which was almost ready to be held out. \" What do you mean ? Ernest, are you going away?\" And her heart beat with sudden fear, lest the lad should rush from the net which she and Theophilus had so benevolently woven for him. \" Very probably,\" he rephed, with a faint flush of gratification at the idea of playing the part of superior coolness. \" I have not, as you know, had time to make any plans, but I shan't trouble you long.\" \"Don't do anything rash!\" she cried, \"Ernest \u2014don't!\" He looked at her in wonder, for he could not"], [157, "in lizzie's bargain 147 mistake the tone of passionate entreaty.

Lizzie never knew how she got home, though she had a dim recoUection of climbing the stairs to her room, and feeling as if the steps were multiplied by tens and twenties. Then she was lying on the floor, wondering why God would not let people die outright, when they did not want to go to heaven or anywhere. What was the good of dying if one could not sleep even then, but must wake and live again ! Oh, what a sham a quiet churchyard was, and what a mockery a corpse's face ! If she were dead her face would"], [160, "lizzie's bargain hi 150 be still and full of rest, and all the time she would be alive somewhere, and if ahve, then thinking of Ernest ; and if thinking of Ernest, then, although dead, stid crying out for death. So she moaned in her first misery, lying on the boards. But after a time she sat up, pushed back the dark cloud of her hair which had fallen dowu, clasped her hands round her knees, and thought of Thorpe Fletcher. She had done her part, and he must do his ; and he would do it, she was well assured, for he was true as steel. Her only fear was lest Ernest should decide on anything rash before Theophdus could interpose, and she would not suffer herself to think of this possibdity. Her weakness left her no choice but to trust this man utterly. She told herself that she hated him ; yet, as she sat on the garret floor, her only comfort was to dwell on his name, \" Thorpe Fletcher,\" as if it were a tower of strength. Her mother, calling from below, \" Lizzie, are you ready ? Do you know that it is nearly two"], [161, "lizzie's bargain Ill 151 o'clock?\" brought her suddenly back to the world of fixed hours and afternoon lessons. She sprang to her feet and put up her hair with trembling fingers. The face which looked out of the dusky Uttle glass was white, but very brave. The great clear eyes looked straight into the future, and saw a hopeless life of poverty. From first to last her one thought must be to pinch and save. She would grow thin and faded in her dreary round of teaching; she could never marry because she could not love again ; her gladness was over, and all her bright days were gone. She would work for her mother ; but in due time her mother would die, and she would be left alone. And after awhde there would be no Lizzie any longer, but a Miss Grey, with a prim cap and formal manners, trying to save a little for herself, and to keep her old age out of the workhouse, by impart ing her small stock of knowledge and feeble old fashioned accomplishments to the chddren of her former scholars.

It should not be starved and stoned when he was gone ; it should not even, in some groping way, miss the little kindness its dreary life had known.

What do yon suppose she thinks of it ? \" \" Since Providence has ordained it, we will hope she sees that it is her duty to be resigned,\" said Miss -Selina. \" And I daresay she is well provided for,\" Miss Caroline interposed. \" That would make resignation easier, no doubt \" said Ernest. \" Do you think a good ex ample would help her at all? Because I feel quite resigned to my fate, and shall be happy to set her one. You would be sure of the wisdom of Providence if you were in my place, wouldn't you, Aunt Selina ? I must show myself worthy of being your nephew.\" \"That I am sure you will do,\" she said warmly. \" Are you really ? Quite sure ? And Aunt Caroline too?\" (She was testifying delight by rapturously worrying his hand.) \" How should I begin ?\" He looked from one to the other with a sneer. \" By being grateful to Providence, that"], [173, "lizzie's bargain 163 IV when the yacht went down my uncle was on board ? Oh ! and do I add a special thanksgiving because my cousin went down with him ? \" \"My dear Ernest!\" she hesitated, \"I am not sure that I would put it so, exactly.\" \" Ernest is a little excited and can't be expected to pick his words just now,\" exclaimed Miss Caro line. She turned to Dorcas. \" Of course Mr. Ernest is a little excited, it's only natural, isn't it, Dorcas ? \" Dorcas had rapidly decided that she had nothing to hope from Ernest. The bitter dislike between them had been the growth of years. \" No use my trying to smooth him down now, he won't stand it,\" she thought, so she answered sourly. \"Well, Miss Caroline, that sort of talk may come natural to Mr. Ernest \u2014 seemingly it does \u2014 but I call it downright wicked \u2014 so there ! \" Ernest wrenched himself away from his aunts, and grasped her hand. \" And you call it just what it is,\" he said ; \" it's the truest word you ever spoke, old Dorcas, and God knows I'm"], [174, "164 lizzie's bargain IV sorry for the poor lady ! \" (As it happened Mr. Vaughan had been five years a widower.) Dorcas stood utterly confounded, having merely followed the instinct which led her to say the most dis agreeable thing she could. Golden possibilities flashed before her eyes, but she had no idea how she had pleased Mr. Ernest, nor what she ought to do for the future. \" Now mind,\" said the young master sharply, \"not a word about this tid to-morrow \u2014 not a syllable to any one. My affairs shan't be chattered about in this gossiping hole till I am well out of it.\" \" Oh no ! Of course not !\" said the sisters, with blank disappointment on their faces. And SeUna added, \" You mean to go to-morrow then ?\" \"First train. Don't you see this man says they'U meet me ? If it weren't for that I'd go to night.\" \"Oh, Ernest!\" moaned Aunt Caroline, \"is it too much to spend one more evening in your old home before you leave it for your splendour?\""], [175, "lizzie's bargain 165 IV \"You will go before Thorpe gets back!\" cried Selina in dismay. \"WeU, you don't suppose I should stop for him!\" said Ernest. \"If I were going to start as an ironmonger he might be some good. He wouldn't exactly help me in starting as a gentle man !\" The sisters quite agreed with him in this es timate of Thorpe, and Selina felt rather ashamed of having mentioned him at all. Ernest's remembrance of that evening is like the remembrance of a dream, where vivid clearness wars with as vivid a sense of unreality. He had that dreamlike feeling of central loneliness with which the sleeper sees a stream of fantastic changes eddying round him, whde he is himself unchanged. The spinsters' fond caresses were grotesque and hateful as a nightmare. But the time came at last when he could escape from their tearful enumera tion of his many virtues, and take refuge yet once more in his garret. He had to pack, he said. His packing did not take him long. He put a"], [176, "166 lizzie's bargain IV few clothes into a little portmanteau, adding to them one or two trifles which had belonged to his mother, and a couple of books which Mr. Markham had given him. Then he stood looking at a faded rose, some morsels of coloured sewing silk, and a torn scrap of paper with fragments of words pencdled on it in a dashing hand. Gifts from Lizzie he had none. Once, in the first bloom of his passion, he had declared that true love had no need of such tokens, and Lizzie had reverenced the chance utterance as a sacred law. But later Ernest himself had felt a natural longing for some remembrance of her, and had hoarded these things for her sake. He eyed them a moment, crushed them in his hand so that the dry rose crumbled into innumerable fragments, and openinghis fingers, let them drift to the floor and lie there. The act was emphatic. There is a certain tenderness in burning such things. You wdl treasure them no longer, but at least they shall be safe from insult. Though love may be dead, no unkindly hand shall be laid upon the corpse. But Ernest left the"], [177, "IV lizzie's bargain 167 memorials of his first dream to Dorcas and the dust-hole. He flung himself on his bed, and tried to realise his altered fortunes. But it was too bewddering. A gulf had suddenly opened to part him from his former Use, and Selina, Caroline, Theophilus, nay, Lizzie herself, stood on the farther side. The idea of her faithlessness gUded past him in tlie strange procession of events, and seemed natural enough in the universal change. So, between sleeping and waking, the night wore away, tdl the Lesborough clock struck five, slowly as if it were a knell. Ernest suddenly remembered that Clark was going to work that morning and would want his tools. It was a curious fact that nothing was changed for Clark, and that he was still doomed to toil with the pickaxe which Ernest had borrowed in a previous existence, and omitted to return. It set bounds to the stupendous transformation which had absorbed the young man's thoughts. He per ceived that he was not the centre of the universe, and was somewhat sobered and saddened in con-"], [178, "lizzie's bargain 168 IV sequence. And he also perceived that he had broken his word. After lying for a few minutes, meditating on these things, he sprang up and hurried on his clothes in the dark, for his caudle had long since died in the socket. \" He can't go to work before six,\" he said to himself. \"I have time yet,\" and he felt his way downstairs, unbolted the door, and stepped into the garden. , It was cold but very still. There was no breath of wind nor any sound of Use. After a minute, when his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he distinguished the line of the wall, and guided himself by that tdl he turned the corner, trod on a roughened spot, and knew that he had reached Sandy's grave. He knelt on one knee to feel for his tools, and having found them, he lingered, laying his hand on the cold earth, as if he caressed his dead favourite. \"Good-bye, old Sandy,\" he said softly; \"if I had only known, you shoidd have feasted like a king, old fellow ; but it's too late. Only last night, Sandy, you came to me, mewing to be let in \" As Ernest spoke he"], [179, "lizzie's bargain 169 IV chanced to look up, and the words died on his hps. Overhead a lamp in a garret window burned like a great star in the blackness, girding a leafless poplar with a band of yellow light. The world slept, but Lizzie shared his vigil. He knelt for a moment, gazing upward. Then he started to his feet and spoke under his breath, lifting his hand towards the far-off brightness. \" If I have judged wrongly \u2014 if I have mis understood \u2014 I dare not think it, but if I have \u2014 God give me a chance to make amends ! If she marries Thorpe Fletcher I shaU know that I was not mistaken. If not, I will come back some day, we wiU stand face to face, and this miserable mystery shall be cleared up. Till then, good-bye, my Lizzie, if by any wonderful chance my Lizzie still lives.\" He stamped in sudden anger on the hardened ground. \"As if I didn't know it is impossible ! ShaU I come back and ask to be fooled a second time ? \" He turned to go, but memories of the moments he had spent there, of the beauty which was his Use's one charm, of the"], [180, "lizzie's bargain iv 170 love which never failed him tdl that fatal day, conspired to hold him back. He looked over his shoulder at the window, across which a shadow moved. \" I will wait three years ! \" he vowed. \" I wdl not speak for three years. But then \u2014 then \u2014 Lizzie ! \" He made his vain resolve with the fervour of boyish certainty, he meant every syllable of it, he was ennobled by his victory over his bitter pride. How could he realise that the next three years might be a new Ufetime, and that before they were over, Lizzie, and Lesborough, and this passionate promise of his, might be but faded memories of a past to which he could not return ?"], [181, "V Wthen Theophdus arrived that same morning, in tending to electrify the household with a little paragraph out of his penny paper, he found the household electrified already, and Ernest gone. He was not at all disconcerted, and merely said he would have some luncheon. Miss Caroline presided over the meal, in a frenzy of impatience, certain that Selina was carrying the great news round Lesborough, while she was answering Thorpe's leisurely questions, and watching every mouthful he ate. She felt that Fate was cruel, and found her only comfort in the reflection, \" How bad Selina wiU make her swelled face, to be sure, going out in this east wind ! \" Thorpe dwelt complacently on the thought"], [182, "172 lizzie's bargain V that Mr. Vaughan, who disowned his sister be cause she married the ironmonger, had got the ironmonger's boy for his heir. Then he remem bered Lizzie, and smiled to himself. \" No need for her to trouble herself about our bargain now. He'll be true to her, I think \u2014 he ought to be kicked if he isn't \u2014 a girl like that ! She deserves her luck \u2014 she's one in a thousand !\" Later in the afternoon, when he had ended his meditations, and rested awhile in pleasant drowsiness, he looked at his watch, sprang up hastily, and went out, hoping to meet Miss Grey. He did meet her, and stopped short. This was not the flushed, excited, triumphant girl he had expected to see. She was pale and cold, and held out her hand to him with a quiet smde. \"I wanted to speak to you, Mr. Fletcher,\" she said. \" Is it possible \u2014 haven't you heard ?\" he began. \"About that poor Mr. Vaughan? Yes, Miss Selina told me this morning.\" \" Selina ! Didn't Ernest tell you himself ?\" She shook her head. \" Ernest wdl never tell"], [183, "lizzie's bargain 173 V me anything more. We had a difference yesterday. It is all over.\" Thorpe stood aghast. \"You kept your word then!\" He whistled softly, then finding that she only looked at him in silence, he recovered him self with a laugh. \" Rather a complication !\" he said. \" We were a little too quick, eh ? But we must set all that right, you know.\" \" I thought you would say that.\" \" Of course I say so. That was what you wanted me for ? \" They were at Lizzie's door. \" Please come in \u2014 I won't keep you long,\" she said, and he fol lowed her into a fireless and only partially-fur nished room. The low ceiling made it oppressively sad, and it was very cold. Thorpe shuddered in his thick coat, and felt as if Lizzie had ushered him into his sepulchre. She glanced at the de solate hearth. \" I'm sorry we have no fire. Won't you sit down ? \" \" It doesn't matter \u2014 no, I'd rather stand, thank you.\" He rested his arm on the chimney-piece as"], [184, "174 lizzie's BARGAIN V he spoke, and looked curiously at her. Why was her face so white and still ? \" How will you set everything right, Mr. Fletcher . \" \" Oh, leave that to me \u2014 I'll see about it \u2014 don't be afraid,\" he said with a slight swagger in his tone. But it ended in a shiver. \" Miss Grey, I hoped you knew me better than to think I'd leave you in the lurch.\" \" I didn't think it for a moment. I knew you wouldn't.\" He advanced a step. \"Well, what on earth makes you look so miserable then ? \" \" How will you set everything right ? \" she repeated, fixing her eyes on his as she drew back. \" How ? I shall go to Ernest, tell him my plan, and the bargain I made with you \u2014 I'U take care he understands how uncommonly weU you behaved \u2014 and I'll either bring him back, or a letter saying he isn't far behind it.

If you do, I wdl never forgive you as long as I live.\" He was not surprised, for he beheved it was the proper thing for girls to be romantic and high flown. Of course it meant nothing. She was a nursery governess, and Ernest had thousands a year. He looked her coolly in the face and smded. \" And if I didn't, Miss Grey, I should never forgive myself. On the whole I fancy that might be the worst. Don't think I make light of your anger, it wiU be very terrible, no doubt, but I must bear it as I have borne a good many things ; and as Ernest is not particularly fond of me, I'm not likely to see much of you in future \u2014 am I?\" He spoke in an easy tone, and waited for her answer. He expected a little more apparent re luctance. It was very foolish, but he felt that he owed her a patient hearing. \" You will go to him in spite of me then ?\" she said."], [186, "lizzie's bargain 176 V He nodded. \"Rather weU put,\" he thought. \"I reply 'Yes.' She shrugs her shoulders \u2014 the matter is taken out of her hands. She has not asked the young man to come back to her, and of course she is not answerable for what 7\" insist on doing. I call that neat.\" But as he looked at her with smihng decision, it suddenly struck him that there was a strangely resolute look in Lizzie's eyes. Could there be some earnest in the sham fight ? He hurried up an argument. \" What do you take me for, Miss Grey, to ruin your prospects, when I can't fulfil my share of the bargain? Remember, I can do nothing for Ernest now.\" She answered swiftly, \" When we were walking home that day, you said Ernest would never be happy here, but that if he went to his own people he must go alone. You meant it, I suppose ?\" \" Ah, but that was different. He would have had his uncle to please. Now he has only him self.\" \" Isn't he to have any friends then ? Was"], [187, "lizzie's bargain 177 V Mr. Vaughan the only man in the world who would have looked down on me ? Say, if you can, that it woidd not be better for Ernest to be free. Ah ! you cannot ! \" Why would she force the unwelcome truth from him ? \" Let Ernest decide that,\" he said. \" He can't. If you teU him, you wdl compel him to come back. No, for his sake it is best as it is.

No, I should die of shame. It is best as it is. I know that I am not fit for him, and you know it too. You must keep my secret.\" He stood silent and perplexed. He no longer questioned her sincerity, but might she not repent ? \" You won't give me your word ? Very weU, then I give you mine, that I won't Usten to him if you bring him back. You will have betrayed me for no good. You know whether I mean what I say, and when I gave him up I gave him up altogether.\" \" If he comes of his own free will ?\""], [189, "v lizzie's bargain 179 She smiled a little. \" We wiU talk of that when it happens, or the day after doomsday, if you like. He will not come. He used to want me,\" her voice quivered as she said it, \"but he wiU not want me now.\" In his heart Theophdus perfectly agreed with her. Pride and temper would assuredly keep Ernest away tdl he had had time to appreciate his new position, and then there was little chance of his return. And for that very reason he was anxious that Lizzie should think well before it should be too late. \"You are sacrificing your self,\" he said. \" Not now,\" she answered. \" That was done and finished when we were on the bridge. You are only asking me to undo it.\" Giving up the master of Southdale appeared to Thorpe widely different from giving tip a sulky lad, who was too fastidious to work for his Uving. He stared at the fender, drawing down his brows in a heavy frown. The engagement would no doubt be an undesirable one for Ernest, whose"], [190, "lizzie's bargain 180 V feelings and ideas would naturally alter, and who would find himself bound to his boyish love when nothing else of his boyhood remained in him. Such marriages were seldom happy, people said, and Ernest was one who would be ashamed of his wife's lowly origin, and who would Uve in uneasy apprehension lest she should betray it by word or look. It would be a mistake, Thorpe was sure of it. Lizzie herself said the same, and refused to call her lover back. Then why should he go out of his way to injure poor Fanny's boy, and bring about this perilous marriage ? But this girl \u2014 was she to tod her whole hfe through, while young Ernest spent his uncle's fortune? She had given up all for his sake \u2014 was he to go away, rejoicing in his escape from the scheming woman who had outwitted herself in jilting him ? And Theophilus himself \u2014 should he turn on his heel, not one farthing the poorer for that bargain of theirs, and leave her despoiled of all ? God forbid ! Thorpe's sturdy sense of justice cried out, and deep down in his heart there"], [191, "lizzie's bargain 181 V woke a new and strange feeUng of wonder, of reverence, of something for which he knew no name. Had he not been so abominably cold that aU energy was chiUed out of him, it seemed to him that he might have risen to the occasion, and known what to say and do. But though Lizzie faced him calmly, Theophilus was shivering from head to foot, and felt helpless and blue. What could he do but make his escape without having absolutely pledged himself to silence ? \"If I did promise to keep your secret,\" he said, \" it would have to be on one condition. You must let me do what I can to help you, and to make some amends.\" He stopped in the hesitating sentence, for he encountered her scornful glance. \" I don't think I understand,\" she said. \" Are you offering to pay me for giving up Ernest ? I think we may as well say good-bye now, I needn't keep you in the cold any longer.\" Something in her look made Theophilus sure that his misery must be very evident indeed. \" Only, Mr. Fletcher, I hope you"], [192, "182 lizzie's bargain V quite see that any interference between Ernest and myself wdl be worse than useless. You wished to part us, and you did it. You may as well be content with that, for you cannot bring us together again.\" Bepulsed, scorned, and numb with cold, Thorpe Fletcher still saw that haunting phantom of justice, and did his best to follow it. He tried to say that perhaps \u2014 at some future time \u2014 if she shoidd think better of it \u2014 and found himself in the act of being ceremoniously shown out of the vault-like room. The sky outside was heavy with coming snow, and with one glance at it he hurried home, and called to Dorcas for a big log for the fire. Long and deeply did he meditate, with eyes fixed on the crackhng blaze, and hands softly rubbed in the delicious warmth. A great thing had befaUen Thorpe. He \u2014 who never doubted his ability to rule the world in the best possible way, if people would only listen to him and to common sense \u2014 was not absolutely certain that he had improved matters by meddling with Ernest"], [193, "v lizzie's bargain 183 and Lizzie. And as he still thought that common sense was on his side, he sat wondering whether, by any possibility, there could be something in life not to be ruled by common sense, as he under stood it."], [194, "VI Two years and a half of the Use, to which Lizzie looked forward so despairingly, had passed away, and Lesborough lay broiling in the August sun. The Misses Fletcher panted and fanned themselves, opened windows which had long been closed, and would almost have proposed to sit in the garden, had it not been as parched and shadeless as the desert. The poplar beyond the waU quivered in the haze of heat. To Lizzie, toiling weardy through the dust, the hot sunshine seemed very pitdess ; and she wanted pity, for things were not going weU with her. The Uttle Crofts were supposed to have grown beyond her teaching, and had been sent to a boarding-school ; and though the grocer's wife loudly proclaimed that she could"], [195, "lizzie's bargain 185 VI speak very ighly of Miss Grey, the recommen- dation was of little service. Lizzie gave a few lessons here and there, and imparted a smattering of French to the baker's daughter ; but that was aU she did, for it ready seemed as if no one in Lesborough had any little chddren needing a dady governess, except Mrs. Bradley, of Park Villa. She had three charming little girls, and, only a few weeks earlier she had asked \u2014 almost entreated \u2014 Miss Grey to take charge of them, offering a singularly liberal salary. But Lizzie, for no apparent reason, had declined the situation \u2014 civilly, but rather coldly. It was incompre- hensible, but it was not so easy to understand Lizzie in these later days. She was altered in face and manner ; her great gray eyes looked even larger than of old, and seemed to have grown darker since the happy light had died out of them. Some people said she had gone off very much, and looked old for her age ; but others thought her handsomer than ever, as she went by with a look on her face that was at once haughty and patient."], [196, "186 lizzie's bargain VI The years that had passed had been even drearier than she had feared, but her resolution was un changed. She had a curious liking for the old red -brick bridge. Now that she had so much leisure she would often walk that way, and if she found herself alone there, she would lay her hand almost caressingly on the low waU. Theophilus Fletcher had prospered greatly during these two years. The Lesborough foundry was far more important than his predecessor ever dreamed of making it. Trade received a new impulse from the throng of grimy workmen, who apparently looked on wages as manna, and thought it would be impious distrust to save a farthing. Fletcher's patent harrows and thrashing-machines were widely advertised ; and as the big man shouldered his way through the crowd on market days, people made room for him with ever increasing respect. He interested himself in local reforms, he gave UberaUy to local charities, and the grounds of his handsome house were always open for flower-shows or school treats. The Rector"], [197, "lizzie's bargain 187 VI found him a valuable ally, and he graduaUy began to make his way into the most exclusive circle of Lesborough society. Mr. Staunton, the Member, whose estates were encumbered, whose family was large, and whose manners were consequently bland, saw that Fletcher might be a power in the coining election, and paid court to him accordingly. Mrs. Staunton was lavish of her smiles ; Miss Staunton was very gracious. She had taken rank as the beauty of the family ten or twelve years earher, and had been so hard to please that at twenty-nine she found herself still Miss Staunton of Lesborough Park, with five half-sisters, who had passed from the nursery to the schoolroom, threatening a speedy termination to her reign. She tried her well-worn fascinations on the com mercial mdhonaire, partly from habit, but with a hesitating idea that something might come of it. She shrank from the possibility, and yet it fascin ated her with its mixture of splendour and de gradation. Theophilus never suspected this, but he met her half-way. It was not his nature to be"], [198, "188 lizzie's bargain VI reserved or frigid with a pretty girl who amused him, and who, in his opinion, was very well able to take care of herself. He was flattered by the Stauntons' civility, and so heart-whole that he could enjoy EUinor's little attentions. He meant nothing at all, and she was not sure that she meant anything, but nevertheless the Lesborough gossips began to talk. Lizzie Grey heard the reports as she went on her way, but she took no apparent heed of them. What was Mr. Fletcher to her ? It was true that she saw him occasionally at his sisters' house. She went there as of old, and heard the Misses Fletcher boast about Ernest, who was at Oxford, they said, and intimate with the nobility. She used to listen with a faint smde. He had taken his uncle's name on succeeding to the property, and was Ernest Vaughan now. This smaU fact seemed to part the present time from the bygone days when Ernest Fletcher loved her. The little parlour seemed shadowy and strange, even when Theophdus came in, with jovial laugh and keen"], [199, "lizzie's bargain 189 VI blue eyes, straight from the open air of his busy everyday world. He was good-humoured and cordial, though he did not say much to her, and never aUuded to their useless compact. But one night Lizzie was weary and depressed. She Ustened helplessly to Selina and Caroline as they retaded the latest scandal, but through it all she was conscious that her Use had come to a dreary pause, and that hope, energy, and courage had all ebbed together. Suddenly there was a loud knock at the door; SeUna stopped short in the middle of a spiteful comment, and Mr. Fletcher came in. \"At tea?\" he said, as he threw himself into the easy-chair. \" Well, yes, you may give me a cup.\" Lizzie, who was cutting bread and butter, knew that he had looked at her when they shook hands, and she vahantly endeavoured to meet his glance as gady as of old. But she was startled when he turned, fixed his eyes on her face, and remarked abruptly : \" I saw you to-day, Miss Grey.\""], [200, "190 lizzie's bargain VI \"Did you?\" she said, beginning to cut another slice. \" I didn't see you.\" \" No, I know you didn't.\" A guilty colour mounted to her cheek, but she made no answer. \" I saw you on the old red bridge \u2014 I say, take care ! \" The warning came too late ; the knife had slipped and cut her hand. She muffled it quickly in her handkerchief, and looked up defiantly. \" It's nothing !\" she said, angry with herseff for the mischance. But the cut, thought not serious, was deep, and the blood was flowing. Miss Selina ran aim lessly about, proposing sugar, cold water, rag, lily leaves. \"No, no!\" Miss Caroline exclaimed, \"a door-key down her back ! I know that's the best thing. I've always heard that a door-key \u2014 or is that when your nose bleeds ? \" \"Rubbish!\" said Thorpe, \"a bit of plaster!\" And before Lizzie knew what he was doing he had thrust his sisters aside, had taken possession of her wounded hand, and was unfolding the"], [201, "lizzie's bargain 191 VI handkerchief. A glance sent SeUna and Caroline flying in different directions for plaster, and for a moment the two were left alone, and face to face. No word was said, but Lizzie was strangely con scious of the firm pressure of his fingers, and was conscious of nothing else. How long was it before the sisters rushed in with their respective plaster cases ? \" I can manage it now, thank you !\" she said hastily. \" So you think,\" he replied. \" I suppose you thought you could cut bread and butter. I'll do both for you to-night.\" As Lizzie sat in enforced idleness, and drank the tea which he brought, it seemed to her as ff a measure of new strength and defiant courage had come back to her. She laughed and talked more like her old self, though she would not encounter those watchful eyes. The hands of the little clock on the chimney-piece went hurrying round, till Mr. Fletcher glanced at it, started, compared it with his great gold watch, and said he must go."], [202, "192 lizzie's bargain VI Lizzie perceived that it was the time at which she usuaUy left, but she felt that it would be like asking for his escort if she announced her departure when he had just spoken ; so she waited, wondering why on earth he waited. At last, after leaning back some time in frowning sdence, he stretched himseff, said, \"WeU, I suppose I must be off,\" and did not stir. Lizzie, determined to outstay him, talked on, tiU Miss Caroline yawned openly, and so compelled her to give way. But when she would have said \" Good-night \" to Mr. Fletcher, he stood up. \" Why, I'm going too,\" he said, \" I'll see you home.\" She tried to refuse, but Selina hurried her off that she might not keep him waiting. Gentlemen didn't like to be kept waiting, she explained to Lizzie as they went upstairs. Lizzie was soon ready, and a minute later she found herself in the moonht street with Thorpe. The pair went a few steps in silence, till a sudden impulse made the girl look up. The Ught fell on her companion's face, and showed her that he was looking at her, from under his heavy"], [203, "lizzie's bargain 193 VI brows, with a direct intensity which sent a shock through her from head to foot. \" Take my arm,\" he said. i She shook her head, and walked more quickly. \" Miss Grey, what is amiss ? Are you well ?\" She was astonished. \" Yes, I'm very weU.\" \" You mean it ? You are not ill, really ?\" \" Of course I mean it ! Thank you for your kind inquiries, Mr. Fletcher, but I am perfectly well.\" \" Then something else is the matter ; you are unhappy.\" She took no notice, and after a moment he went on, in low tones which were even more imperious for their self-restraint : \" Answer me, Miss Grey ; are you unhappy ? \" They had reached her door as he spoke. She was silent still, but not with the silence which would have been an admission of unhappiness. She gathered all her strength, and met his eyes with a look of inquiry and defiance. \" No answer ? \" he said. \" No concern of mine, of course. Oh, you are quite right, Miss Grey \u2014 VOL II.

She looked after Lizzie with lofty wonder, and a faint involun tary admiration, lost the thread of what she was saying, bade Mr. Fletcher farewell a little absently, and drove off, sighing at the idea that a wealthy man should have such threadbare acquaintances. Mrs. Staunton rather liked him than otherwise \u2014 in fact, she liked him well enough to say \" Really ! I'm very sorry,\" when a few days later a rumour ran through the town that he was mixed up in some foreign speculation and had lost money. People hardly knew what to think, but looked doubtfully at one another. It was so unlikely that they could not believe any one could have invented it.

The baker's daughter, having discovered that she knew French enough to give her a fine sense of superiority to her friends, had discontinued her lessons, and her teacher was left more hopeless than before. While Mrs. Staunton was arching her brows over the tidings of Thorpe Fletcher's losses, Lizzie sat by her mother's bedside, trying to impart a courage she could not feel. \"I shall die in the workhouse,\" moaned Mrs. Grey. \"No, no!\" said Lizzie. \"It cannot come to that.\" But she trembled as she said it, and lay awake half the night, tormented with visions of sombre possibilities.

She had the blue envelope in her hand ; she was going to return it that afternoon, and her mother had kissed her as she stooped to say \" Good-bye.\" \" Was I cruel ? \" she said to herself, when she was once more in her own room. She went to the window. The poplar was trembling in the summer breeze, and below lay the strip of garden down which Ernest used to come in the days which seemed so long ago. \" I hope I wasn't cruel,\" she thought, leaning out to cool her aching eyes. \" I have done nothing for him.

She felt that she could not risk a repetition of that morn ing's conflict, nor the chance that another gift might arrive, and be accepted without her knowledge. She must refuse Mr. Fletcher's money in terms about which there could be no mistake. She could not wait for a chance meeting, since it might not occur for weeks, and he would think all the while that she had taken his bounty- There was no help for it ; she must go to his office and find him there. And the road was so cruel, it kept the end of her journey continually before her. Every step brought her visibly nearer to that dreaded interview the mere thought of which made her heart die within her, yet the way was so weardy long. She walked as fast as she could, conning over the words she meant to say, with an uneasy certainty that Mr. Fletcher's eyes would frighten every syllable out of her head.

I wdl not keep him long.\" It seemed to her as if, in uttering the words, she had contrived for a moment to outstrip her own nervousness, and it overtook her exactly as she ceased to speak. She felt the hot colour in her cheeks, and the eager beating of her heart made it hard to catch the man's reply. But she knew that she gave her name, and that a white-faced lad, whom they called Bates, went upstairs to ask if Mr. Fletcher were disengaged. The civil clerk gave her a chair, and she sat, looking through the open window into the busy, grimy yard. A man, who seemed to be a farmer, came in, and looked curiously at her as he went by.

She would have run away, but she had a wild idea that the clerks and the farmer would think her mad and follow her, shouting, till Bates, and Thorpe Fletcher himself, would come thundering down the uncarpeted stairs to join in the pursuit. She waited in an agony of suspense tid Bates re turned, and asked her to step upstairs. She followed him with desperate courage. He ushered her into Mr. Fletcher's room in silence and closed the door after her. It was a smaU room, bright and sunshiny. Thorpe had been budding extensively at the foundry, and his office, which was only temporary, gave a general impression of new boards. Lizzie advanced a step towards the table, winch was covered with papers, and then saw him standing at the window.

He resumed his former position by the window, a position in which the light did not fall on his face, but whence he could look sideways at the Lesborough road. Lizzie pulled out the envelope. \" Mr. Fletcher, you sent that.\" He glanced at it, and nodded in the most matter-of-fact way possible, but his eyes went quickly back to the ribbon of dusty white which lay across the level fields. \" I have brought it back,\" she said, puzzled at his manner. \" Pray don't send any more.\" \"You don't want it?\" He tapped the pane with restless fingers. \"No.\" \" You have found a situation wliich suits you, perhaps ?\" he went on, this time looking straight out of the window and fairly turning his back upon her."], [218, "208 lizzie's bargain VII Lizzie, perplexed and nervous, had half-for gotten what she meant to say.

I did hear of one, and when I went to ask about it, I found it was only another way of living on your alms.\" \" The idiotic woman ! She overdid it, I sup pose,\" growled Thorpe, manifestly disconcerted, but without the faintest attempt at disguise. \" I am sure she tried to keep your secret, Mr. Fletcher. But you have taught me to suspect any good fortune, I think.\" His answer was an inarticulate grunt. He stdl kept his back to her. It was very disagreeable to have to address her remarks to his shoulders and what she could see of the back of his head, which he held down doggedly. The one idea conveyed by the outline of those shoulders was that of inert and ponderous obstinacy.

Now that she had ended the sort of understanding which had existed between them, and, no doubt, offended him for ever, she hardly understood her own confused and warring feel ings.

The Times says : \u2014 \" ' Mitchelhurst Place ' is interesting quite as much for what it discloses of the poetic fancy of the authoress as;for its study of character. Em bedded in these pages are scraps of verse which show considerable talent ; and even the contemplation of the moon struggling in a stormy sky is not too hackneyed a theme to evoke an imaginary flight, free from either bombast or pathos.\" The Spectator says : \u2014 \"A really good novel. . . . Now it is obvious, we think, that the literary skill evinced in the above extracts would suffice for the production of a very good novel indeed, provided that their writer had a good story to tell and could tell that story well. Miss Veley \u2014 and here we may notice a marked im provement on her ' For Percival '\u2014is very strong on both points. ' Mitchelhurst Place' is a story which rivets the attention from the first page to the last, and the writer's management of her plot is perfect.\" The Saturday Review says :\u2014 \"Miss Veley writes\u2014 in excellent English and with abundant cleverness and insight\u2014 of one of Nature's step-children, of a man marked down for misfortune to the extent of being himself his curse and his executioner.\" The Guardian says : \u2014 \"An exceeding good novel.\" A NEW NOVEL. NE\u00c6RA : a Tale of Ancient Rome. By JOHN W. GRAHAM. 2 Vols. 8vo. 24s. %* Though the scene is laid in Ancient Home, and the surroundings are correctly given, it must not be supposed that this story, the first effort of a new writer, is of merely antiquarian interest. The opinions quoted below sufficiently show that the book appeals to all readers who care for a well-told tale, full of thrilling incident awl striking situations, skil fully worked out lo a satisfactory dinoument. In a letter to a friend, published in tlie Athen\u00e6um on December 4, Mr. Glad stone says : \u2014 \" Having finished 'Ne\u00e6ra,' I cannot refrain from saying that it seems to me a really remarkable book, with great uprightness of aim, signal power of drawing character.'and a great faculty of writing. . . . Several of the scenes are in my judgment of singular power. The writer is unknown to me, but he ought to make his mark.\" The Edinburgh Review says : \u2014 \"It is given to us as a picture of Roman life, under an Emperor as infamous as the Antonines were honourable ; and the picture is, we think, carefully drawn, and in its general features trustworthy. . . . Mr. Graham has at the least given us a story of sustained interest, which he has done well in connecting with the little island rock of Capri. On this island Tiberius has left a lasting mark, and the remains of his work bear out the old stories told about him. . . . We may take leave of Mr. Graham's interesting and powerful tale with a few words in which he speaks of the palaces and prisons which rose here at the despot's command.\" MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON."], [238, "NEW NOVELS.
