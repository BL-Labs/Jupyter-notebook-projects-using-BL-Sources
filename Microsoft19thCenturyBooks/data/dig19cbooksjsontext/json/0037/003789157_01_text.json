Military glory, in all its varied phases, had charmed and dazzled me- from childhood.

She was a kind of tough, weather-proof, In dia-rubber woman, \" Six feet high- Grand, epic, homicidal,\" who could travel over hundreds of miles of prairie on horseback, or follow the train for months on top of a baggage-waggon. Familiar intercourse with the most savage tribes of Indians was nothing to her ! Human sympathy, food, or rest, were mere frivolous weaknesses, necessities of our fallen nature, which she banished from her high-strung mind. A strong energy of character sustained her through the direst emergencies, nothing could unstring her dauntless nerves. The allurements of dress, petty artifices, tears, or any other little feminine failings she scorned contemptuously! The many minor ills of life she smiled at sardonically."], [21, "ENLISTING. 15 \" The regiment\" adored her, and her children (if she had any) were embryo soldiers, arrayed in military baby clothes, cradled in a disabled drum, tucked in with a piece of \" star-spangled banner,\" and teething on a drumstick.

The \" worldly goods\" with which I was endowed in Grace Church, the day of my enlist ment, consisted of a mortgage on a camp kettle, mess chest, bundle of canvas, and set of tent poles, which awaited me at a distant frontier station. Even these few luxuries seemed superfluous to so ardent a campaigner.

It is true my early training had not been a peculiarly Spartan preparation for endurance and hardship ; on the contrary, it would pro bably have been regarded with stern disap proval by those strict disciplinarians, yet this was more reason for feeling sanguine. What is more impracticable than the antici pations of youth ? Invariably exaggerated \u2014 invariably disappointed. Those faded leaves rustling mournfully through the bleak autumn forests, are the same which, in early spring-time, put forth a delicate ver dure, to gladden the summer with their beauty. So experience dimmed the roseate hue of my early day dreams, yet they have been suffi ciently realized to tempt a record of them. The usual course adopted with recruits is, when a sufficient number are collected, to stow them away in the recesses of a dark old ship, and start them off, to be distributed among the different regiments in the field But having"], [23, "ENLISTING. 17 selected a particular arm of the service I was at liberty to join at leisure, in fact, allowed a short reprieve before going upon active duty, and im proved the opportunity to revisit that mammoth trap, otherwise called West Point, where the couleur de rose of army-life serves as a bait for the unsophisticated, where reality wears the gloss of romance, and military glory appears in its brightest holiday dress, accompanied by all the poetry of war. Most delusive spot, where even the atmo sphere seems heavily freighted with martial music and martial association. This was not the place to chill a military ardor, but rather to foster it to the utmost. Our young country, generally so barren of historical association, here presents a strong con trast to that deficiency.

West Point, beautiful West Point, how bright are the memories of those who associate their \"Love's Young Dream\" with thee ! I would gladly have transferred my newly ac quired canvas and camp-kettles from Texas to this place, and pitched a tent here for life, had fate and the commander-in-chief so ordained ; but it was otherwise arranged by these mighty powers, probably for the reason that the best soldiers were needed on the frontier, the post of danger being the post of honor, as the flower of chivalry is proverbially placed in the van guard !

Awaiting our return from Detroit, at Nia gara, was a voluminous package from Washing ton, having an alarmingly official appearance. It proved to be the first orders for military duty. They were decidedly different from what had been expected ; instead of summons to \" the tented field,\" they were instructions to proceed without loss of time to Burlington, Vermont, and there to establish a recruiting rendezvous to enlist soldiers for Uncle Sam. Rather common-place business compared to what had been antici pated."], [26, "20 ENLISTING. I knew Vermont by name, and that it was painted green on the atlas at school ; there was a time when its cities, rivers, and mountains had been learned by rote, and repeated with the singular velocity peculiar to extreme youth, in happy unconsciousness of their real location, or anything definite in relation to them. Later in life I had heard casual mention made of \" Vermont horses,\" and \" Green \"Mountain boys,\" but here all knowledge on the subject came to a dead stand-still, and I felt quite eager for the hour to arrive, that would give me a clearer insight into this terra incognita. We left Niagara immediately, took a steam er at Queenston for Montreal, and after a de lightful sail of twenty-four hours across Lake Ontario (which, in its vast expanse of waters, seems more like the ocean than an inland sea), we entered the waters of the St. Lawrence. The sail down its rapids is disagreeably excit ing ; the boat seems threatened every moment to be dashed to pieces, as the pilot skilfully guides it through these perilous mazes. The river rushes impatiently, fretting over the bed"], [27, "ENLISTING. 21 of rocks which impedes its course, until it reaches its thousand isles, where it seems to pause, to flow lovingly around their beautiful banks. They are very beautiful ; some spreading out for miles in emerald meadow lands, and some only large enough to form the bed of a single forest tree, their banks edged with long grasses, intermingled with wild flowers, drooping over and reflecting graceful fringes in the translucent waters below. At this point the river seems almost loath to pass on, and does so lingeringly, until it gradu ally widens into a broad, clear, majestic flow, wider and wider, until it merges itself into that ocean, which at its outset it seemed so eagerly impatient to reach. Towards evening of the third day after leav ing Niagara, we arrived at Montreal, where we stopped for a few days to rest. The un-Ameri can air of this place is very striking. In some parts the streets are very narrow, which, com bined with the steep roofs of the houses, gives it the air of an old French provincial town. The"], [28, "22 ENLISTING. mixture of French and English inhabitants, commingling in their domestic habits the cus toms of their native lands, makes a strange pot pourri of manners. However, the peculiar characteristics of each seem uninfluenced by the other. It would seem as impossible for these two nations to amalgamate, as for oil and water to unite. The happy faculty of adapting one's prejudices to circumstances seems a pecu liarly American trait, and may almost be re garded as the national characteristic ; the result probably of the gathering together of so many nationalities under the out-spread wings of that responsible fowl, the Apis of this people. One morning we went to the convent of \" Les S\u0153urs Grises,\" and were shown all over the vene rable pile by quite a pretty sister. In an exqui site little Gothic chapel they were celebrating mass for the soul of a priest who had recently died. We paused at the door, and silently lis tened to the swell of rich harmony that came rolling in deep volumes from the organ, and filled the air with its full solemn cadence. St. Cecilia herself might have been touching the"], [29, "ENLISTING. 23 keys, so inspired the strains that were poured forth, first in the low, sad, prayerful plead ings of fallen humanity, and then in the loud triumphant swell of \" the angels around the throne.\" Before we left, I asked our guide why she had become a nun. With downcast eyes, and a sanctified smile, she replied, that \" like Mary, she had chosen the better part !\" The \" better part\" is not always the pleasantest, I thought, if wearing a scanty grey gown, and being shut up for life within four stone walls, praying for the forgiveness of sins you never have a chance to commit, constitutes it ; and with these rather carnal reflections I passed out of the massive gates, fancying the heavy air that we left behind must have derived some of its oppressive influ ence from the many sighs for liberty that had for years been borne on it. We left Montreal the next morning in the cars for Lake Champlain. Not those miserably contrived cars filled with an indiscriminate crowd of males and females, arrayed in that brown linen uniform, the national costume of"], [30, "24 ENLISTING. the travelling American people, where high and low sit side by side ; where the dirty woman with a disagreeably large band-box, and the man who regales himself all too profusely on \" plug,\" seem to vie which shall most contribute to your annoyance ; but the private European coupee, in which, at some slight difference of expense, a person can travel as if in his own carriage. I have often been surprised, when suffering from travelling annoyances, that in the advancement of luxury these cars have never been introduced upon our railroads. Stopping at St. John's (the port of entry ot Lower Canada), a military station at that time unoccupied (its spreading, empty barracks look ing very desolate, with no sounds of life to break the stillness around), we changed cars, and in a short time reached the wharf, and went on board the steamer that was to take us down Lake Champlain, to the point of our destination. This lake is celebrated even in our land. so rich in the picturesque and grand, for the bold and beautiful scenery of its banks. The gigantic mountains seem piled in vast rocky"], [31, "ENLISTING. 25 masses, stretching from the water's edge into the clouds, almost beyond sight, their shadows reflected iu the lake, as in an azure-tinted mirror. The sloping mountain sides, with deep, wild dells and waterfalls, and piles of fir-clad rocks ; the peaceful grain-decked valleys, with rivulets, and towns, and villages discernible among them, formed an ever changing picture of rural beauty. Towards afternoon we came in sight of Bur lington, situated on the banks of the lake, and nestling in the arms of lofty mountain ranges, still clothed in their primeval forests ; where the deer and wild animals yet hold possession, and are only intruded upon by the occasional adventurous huntsman. The bank on which the town lies, is high above the level of the water ; the lake, like a silver sheet glittering at its feet, spreads far away, till lost in the base of the mountains that surround it, and whose hundred streams feed its wealth of waters. 2"], [32, "CHAPTER H. RECRUITING.

Few signs of fife or animation are to be seen iu those quiet cottage homes. Occasionally, perhaps, at the back door of the vine-shaded piazza, a placid old lady, seated in her low rocking-chair shelling peas, stopped for a mo ment by the sight of a humming-bird too dar ing in its demonstrations to the roses, or a stray fowl in the flower-beds. These will be the events of the day to her, in her quiet, unevent ful existence. We smile at its quaint simpli city, but perhaps a sigh of regret is mingled for a moment with our smile. I supposed that Burlington was one of those simple, unexciting little places, as in time it proved to be, but the first impressions were anything but calm or soothing, as early on the following morning I looked from the windows of the \"True American,\" through a greenish pane of glass, and through a still more refract ing misty rain. Under these depressing influ ences I saw what appeared to be the most mise rable of \" one horse towns.\" A square inclosed by a whitewashed wooden railing, rendered a disagreeable grey by tho"], [34, "28 RECRUITING. rain, ornamented with a pole in the centre, sur mounted by one of the numerous and widely diffused coiffures of the goddess of liberty, and surrounded by the principal stores of the place \u2014 this formed the view outside, occasionally ani mated by one of the damp, moist population, picking their way over the grass-grown brick pavements. The inside of the hotel was a degree more insufferable, and by way of rendering my gloom more pitiable, the well-meaning landlady pro vided several \"Lady's Books\" for my amuse ment, the contents of which, however, were such a reflection upon even tlie limited capaci ties of \" ladies \" that they gave only fresh cause for aggravation. A gentleman travelling for pleasure, who arrived there the second day after we did, was taken ill and died in the room next to mine, which incident, although perhaps tending to produce a salutary mental influence, was in no way cheering to depressed spirits. After a fair test of a week, spent in reflec tions of the most gloomy nature on the ills of life in general, and those of a life in Burlington in"], [35, "RECRUITING. 29 particular, it was decided that life at the \" True American\" was unendurable, and by good luck a cottage was secured on the outskirts of the town. It was everything that could be desired ; the velvet lawn in front was green and closely sha ven, rose vines clung gracefully around the porch, and not even a cynic could have ima gined love contemplating a leap from the latticed window, or another grim visitor with his hand on the old-fashioned knocker. In the rear was a well inclosed With trellis-work, whose moss covered buckets looked cool and tempting, sug gesting, however, to a practical mind that new ones must be immediately obtained, in spite of the romantic charm thrown by the poet around \" The moss-eo . ered bucket that hung in the welL\" The only drawback to taking immediate pos session of this attractive spot was the fact of its being quite devoid of furniture ; but we were told that this deficiency could be speedily re medied, by a cleverish sort of fellow named Noble Lovely (which was literally his cogno men). He was immediately applied to, and"], [36, "30 RECRUITING. after an incredible space of time spent in ask ing questions, he cast his eyes around upon his household gods, and said : \" Well, neow, what would you think of a second-hand red plush sofy, and a yellow chanie spittoon to begin with?\" This proposal was beyond human en durance, and as these articles were not consi dered absolutely indispensable in an unpretend ing menage, it was deemed advisable to with draw, which induced Mr. Lovely to speedily make the necessary arrangements ; and, to use the technical Yankee expression, \" the bargain was closed,\" to the inexpressible delight of the shrewd and (not over) Noble Lovely, who \" real ized quite a little considerable \" in consequence. From the first I imbibed a strong dislike to this class. I do not think these feelings were en tirely without foundation. In fact I may candidly confess, that I never could feel the necessary degree of enthusiasm in reference to our New England brethren, or their fundamental principles of the innate depravity of the Pope, intense sympathy for that colored \" army of martyrs \" south of Mason and Dixon's"], [37, "RECRUITING. 31 line, or the infallibility of the pilgrim fathers. On the contrary, I conceive the Pope may he an excellent good man, that those suffering and bleeding bondsmen may have an occasional ray of sunshine on their dreary path of life, and that the way in which the heroes of Plymouth Rock burned Quakers and eccentric old ladies was, to say the least, unamiable. We all, however, have our prejudices, in com mon with them, and I suppose, would hardly be human without them. Six months, comprising the severest of the year, were passed in Burlington in ardent endeavors to add to the United States forces as many deserters from the ranks of her majesty of England, as could persuade the re cruiting sergeant they were regularly dis charged, and the doctor that they were \" able bodied.\" They were a reckless set of men, generally under five-and-twenty years of age, a collection probably of black sheep from as many different families ; some of them well educated, and un doubtedly of highly respectable parentage.

Apply a uniform to a man, and like a mustard plaster, it seems to draw all that is inflammable to the surface. One or another of the recruits was always at hand, and in turn they scoured the country to get anything that it was not easy to obtain in the town. I often pitied them as they flaunted about in their gay trappings (like sheep dressed for the slaughter), to think how soon their exist ence would probably terminate, on some march across the prairies, in the . sickly swamps of Florida, or on the perilous Indian scout, shot by the poisoned arrow of a Camanche or Sioux. Between them and the gamins of Burlington, there existed a continual feud.

This remark was followed by an exciting row, which terminated in a series of mutilations and dark rims around the visual organs of most of the gallant recruits, a squad of whom were forthwith despatched to Fort Columbus \u2014 among them, that troublesome but \" hold soldier boy \" with the annoying cap, who, it was discovered, hailed from Kilkenny, which most satisfactorily accounted for the excrescences behind his ears."], [40, "CHAPTER III.

His place is beautifully situated north of the town, on a small promon tory that stretches into the lake.

Fine forest trees, scattered in groups, abound all over the domain.

The interior of the house bears impress of the home of the scholar and man of taste ; the library opening on a piazza by an enormous oriel window, from which, through clambering honeysuckle vines, you can enjoy one of the grandest pictures ever sketched by nature on earth's fair tablet. The walls of the library are covered with paintings, the work of the artistic hand of Bishop H., who is generally to be found sitting in this room at his desk, writing tracts and religious essays for the press, to send forth into the world from his secluded home, like the sower of holy writ casting forth his seed.

The sleighing was unsurpassable, but the in tense cold of the frosty cutting air spoiled the enjoyment of it. At times exposure was next to impossible ; the thermometer fifteen degrees below zero was no uncommon thing.

A few months saw us on the confines ot Mexico, while they were journeying towards the burning plains of India. One individual who figured on this occasion is worth a word of notice. A person represent ing himself as an English gentleman, travelling in this country for amusement and information, had arrived in Burlington that autumn, and taken rooms at the hotel. Although not a par ticularly attractive or agreeable man, he was not the opposite, and in dearth of other society, became quite a habitue at some of the most respectable citizens' houses. He had a dog-cart, horses, guns, and pointers, and professed to be a great sportsman. He was very devoted in his attentions to a young Canadian girl, and a hand some widow, who were considered by the public to be rivals, between whom this gay deceiver was wavering. He had had very extensive dealings with the bank, which at first imposed on the community, and then excited suspicion. One day he sud-"], [47, "BURLINGTON. 41 denly disappeared, and no traces of him were to be found, leaving his lady-loves disconsolate, and carrying with him quite a sum of money that he had obtained by fraud. The following year he was traced to a seclud ed western village, where a repetition of similar amorous and financial performances had render ed suspicion certainty, and finally lodged him safely in a penitentiary, where he could expia'e his rascality by the harmless pastime of hewing stone or making shoes. It is easy to picture him in the mind's eye, in a woven wool round about and trousers, one yellow leg and arm, and one black, with a cap to match, pursuing the even tenor of his way on a daily meal of bean broth and ship biscuit, his conversation limited to an occasional whisper through the register tubes to the prisoner in the next cell, at the risk of a severe penalty for even this slender mode of communication with his kind.

Tlie departure for Texas was delayed until the month of April, when we sailed in the steamship \" Ohio,\" bound for New Orleans, via the Havana. Its gallant commander (com manders are always gallant, or ought to be) was so kind to me, that I would add a public eulogy to the many private ones I have pronounced on him, if it were in good taste to do so. His in variable kindness and good-humor were almost a cure for sea-sickness, that most doleful of all the maladies wliich flesh is heir to. There was on board a very agreeable and amusing party, and in the informal intercourse of a sea voyage the time passed rapidly. The only drawback to its pleasure was the slight one of being totally deprived of \" balmy sleep,\" by a nightly row in the opposite state room, not at all propitious to the cultivation of \" nature's sweet restorer !\" It was occupied by a family of (two or three dozen, I should think) small infants, under the charge of an old black \" aunty,\" who was kept in a continual state of excitement, all being sea-sick at the same time ; and to the daily inquiries of the head of the"], [54, "48 ORDERS. family after their progress, I heard the invaria ble and discouraging reply of \" sick, massa ! all hands ! \" AVe were a good deal in sight of land, and kept in view the shores of Maryland, Delaware, and the Carolinas. When off the coast of Flo rida we came near enough to land to see the wreckers at work on a large ship, that had been abandoned by its crew. These wreckers are a miserable, unprincipled, ignorant race, who live on the sea-coast, where, on account of its peculiar formation, accidents are very numerous. Their only means of sub sistence depending upon the losses and misfor tunes of their fellow-men, they seem to be the last traces left, in North America, of the buca neer or sea-robber race. The same afternoon, some hours later, in pass ing the reefs, we saw a brig with its flag of dis tress up.

We were now within the current of the Gulf Stream. That night of moonlight on a southern sea ! It seems a dream in retrospect. The moon min gled its soft light with the balmy delicious air as it arose, and faintly illuminated the still blue waters ; while spicy odors from the shore told that it was Cuba that lay before us, stretching in that misty, indistinct line in the distance. Cuba, that beautiful gem of the Mexican gulf, whose breath is fragrance, whom Nature seems to have chosen (in one of her most prodigal freaks) to have showered with all the rarest and most precious of her gifts. Later on that night, bright and luminous above us, rose the Southern Cross, emblazoned in characters of gold upon the deep ground work of the midnight sky. 3"], [56, "CHAPTER V. THE TROPICS.

After the usual preliminaries, and a most ceremonious visit from the Spanish authorities, who came in a brightly-decorated barge with striped red and white awnings, and the Spanish flag in the stern, manned by twenty liveried oarsmen, only surpassed in the gaudy taste of their dress by the officers, whose uniforms, rib bons, and stars seemed much more abundant than the occasion required. They finally as sured themselves that we were only a peaceful set of travellers, and not an invading army of filibusters. The passports were duly made out and paid for, and then these worthies departed. It was no great deprivation to lose sight of their"], [58, "52 TnE TROPICS. ugly, swarthy faces, that beamed with anything but benevolence or beauty. Finally, we passed down the ladder at the vessel's side to the boat that awaited us, were rowed swiftly to the shore, and landed on a dock, piled with sugar barrels and boxes, on which reclined groups of negro slaves in the lightest possible attire, while others were load ing and unloading cargoes. Many younger scions of Africa were loitering about, who proved, by licking the sides of the molasses barrels, that the propensities of youth are alike in all climes and among all races. In Havana, garments, like discretion or expe rience, come with age ; they are quite unknown to the younger portion of the inhabitants. We soon found ourselves in a hotel, quite no vel in all its phases to the untravelled Ameri can.

The massive front doors of all the houses are orna mented with iron bars, made to stand attacks from without, so continually do the upper classes live in dread of revolution and assault.

We were almost immediately shown to a room, floored with brick, and provided with iron furniture, on the way up obtaining a large bunch of exotics, bought from a young negress flower-girl, who was seated at the head of the stairway. At dinner, the table was piled with rare flow ers and fruits, and the \" imprisoned sunshine\" of the golden hock, and crimson claret, round the miniature icebergs in the \" flowing cup,\" with the piles of pineapples, bananas, pomegranates, and nectarines, seemed entirely to take from the stern reality of roast beef.

A dress of muslin, sans chapeau, is sufficient protection against the weather, and all that custom exacts for the \" toilette\" of an afternoon drive. The volante, the vehicle of this country, is at the door before six o'clock. To those who have ridden in them, a description would be super fluous, and to those who have not, it will be almost impossible. Its lazy motion as it moves along hardly disturbs the soft atmosphere. Our volante, hired by the day during our short stay, was the property of a Cuban noble man, who had retired to his country-seat among the mountains, and left it and his coachman in town, to be hired by strangers. He must pro bably have been \" hard up,\" judging by this proceeding, but this is merely a natural surmise. It was \"got up\" in most gorgeous style, and in the gaudy taste peculiar to Spanish-Americans.

A jacket, a la Grecque, of crimson cloth, embossed with gold, falling open and exhibiting a gaily trimmed vest, and linen edged with deep lace ruffles, tights, and top boots, inlaid, and finished round the top with gold fringe, and a cord and tassel of the same. A beaver hat, with a broad gold band and cockade, complete their stylish outfit. These liveries are always gay, sometimes ele gant, and at times bordering on the grotesque. A volante, with all its charms, would be as much out of place in a city of the United States, as a trotting waggon and pair of fast horses would be at the Plaza de Armes of Havana. Our first drive embraced a great deal. It first took us through the town, towards the sub urbs ; it was the hour of evening vespers, and the chimes were tolling out their call to devotion. The Spanish donnas, in their black lace veils, holding rosaries in their hands, followed by"], [62, "56 THE TROPICS. negro slaves in livery bearing their prayer books, looked very picturesque. In some places the streets are so narrow, that opposite neighbors could shake hands from the windows, if so inclined. Negresses, selling bouquets and bunches of loose flowers, spread out in tempting array in large flat shallow baskets, which they balance gracefully on their heads when they walk, are to be seen in all directions sitting at the corners of the streets, where they display their beautiful articles of merchandise. There is, I was told, quite a large free co lored population in Havana. Here you often meet with the genuine native of Southern Africa, caught from the wilderness by the slave trader, but a few years before. If we could compare these brutal animal fea tures, and lack of all intellect, to the \" Uncle Toms\" and \"Aunt Chloes\" of our land, we might be convinced that from one point of view at least, slavery might be regarded as a blessing instead of \" a curse.\""], [63, "CHAPTER VI HAVANA. A drive to the \"Bishop's Garden\" through the suburbs of Havana, seemed like shifting scenes from fairy land. Beautiful villas skirted the road on either side, some of a pale blue color, some rose, and other delicate hues of stucco, surrounded by gardens beyond descrip tion lovely \u2014 while delicious \"Odor was upon the breeze, Sweet thefts of rose and lemon trees.\" We could see directly through the houses (the doors and windows being open and latticed with iron) into the gardens in the rear, where, among fountains and arbors, children with their attendants were scattered in every direction.

Some of the nobility live in a style of eastern magnificence, with an enormous retinue of slaves in attendance. When we arrived at the bishop's garden we alighted at the entrance. It was the former residence of the Roman Catholic bishop of Cuba, about five or six miles out of the city. The house had been destroyed by a hurricane some years before, but the ruins still remain. We entered these beautiful domains on' foot, leaving our volante at the entrance. How can I find words to describe the over whelming surfeit that this garden gives to the sense of the beautiful ; every tropical plant and tree grows in unpruned and wild luxuriance. Cape jessamine hedges, japonicas, tea-roses, and passion flowers, in profusion. I remember one of these latter vines, running up the side of a giant mahogany tree, its foliage of deep green, bright with blossoms, waving about its branches like a richly gemmed drapery. We saw here the remains of a former zoologi-"], [65, "59 HAVANA. cal garden, at present but poorly maintained. Among other novelties was an alligator, but my preconceived ideas of this animal, gathered from the graphic pen of Peter Parley, who paints him and the duplicity of his character in such vivid and fearful terms, made my visit to him of very short duration. His terrible jaws and deceitful expression of countenance, seemed fully to justify all the censtires that his various bio graphers have bestowed upon him. The birds were very attractive ; their, bright plumage of various shades of lemon and rose color, and their graceful forms, were beautiful even to an ignorant person, whose dim recollec tion of their Latin names and classifications was almost disgraceful in these palmy days of the general diffusion of knowledge. Several negroes were here at work with balls and chains attached to their ankles, which served the purposes of anchors ; they were con victs, who were thus employed by the govern ment, to keep the grounds in order, their sole attire a jupon of about a foot long, resembling a scanty ruffle, around the waist."], [66, "60 HAVANA, Magnolia, pomegranate, and pine-apple trees, coffee, tobacco, and sugar-cane, were growing in the open air. Everything that we are only used to see in dried specimens, in stores, or on the table, here grew, as the most hardy grain does in our climate. Simple existence is enjoyment in this deli cious atmosphere, so balmy the air, so exquisite the perfume wafted on each breeze. Yet, like the whitened sepulchre, within all is corruption. A tarantula or scorpion lies in ambush under many a lovely blossom, and the breath of \" the pestilence that walketh in the noonday,\" is mingled with the perfumed breeze that is wafted over this beautiful \"gem of the ocean,\" this waning \" lone- star\" that pleads through its silent and crushed people to join our constella tion. To the Cubans the word freedom is a mockery ; the suspicious and vigilant watchfulness prac tised by the Spanish authorities is almost in credible to us. It must be the impulse of every generous heart, who gains the merest insight into the"], [67, "61 HAVANA. dreadful system of taxation and oppression, suffered by the inhabitants of this colony of Spain, to become a filibuster in feeling if not in principle. The people are eagerly listening for the watchword of revolution, and it is the earnest wish of all but the emissaries of the Spanish throne, to see Cuba enrolled in our nnion. Philanthropy more than aggrandizement should be our motive for its annexation. In returning from our drive, as we passed along, \" the light from alabaster lamps\" in the interior of the houses, mingling with the soft rays of the moon outside, lighted up the gar dens and the porches, and gave a subdued effect to the surrounding country. As we approached the town, and entered the Paseo de Isabella, the gas-lights began to glimmer from the city, the marble statues shone pale and ghostly in the moon's light, and the glistening flowers, laden with evening's dews, sent forth an odor, with which the air was heavily laden.

The opera-house (which at this season was closed), a sumptuously furnished cafe, and some of the magnificent palaces of the aristocracy, front this Paseo. After lingering here awhile, we drove to the Plaza des Armas, or Champs de Mars, fronting the residence of the governor, a marble palace surrounded by a garden, in the centre of which wTas a colossal fountain, surmounted by a statue of one of the numerous Spanish Ferdinands. On the opposite side of the Plaza the govern ment buildings and barracks are situated. Every evening the military band plays in front of the governor's palace for several hours.

They appeared to me very coarse, with swarthy skins, and inclined to embonpoint. However, by such a mere casual glance, it is hardly fair to judge on so delicate a subject as personal beauty. The populace, divested of their squalor by the magic of the moon's light, were picturesquely grouped around, while the exquisite flood of Italian music that swelled on the soft air, through the hum of the audience, seemed even more beautiful than such melody invariably is. The German school of music is certainly very beautiful, and profoundly scientific ; and that of France and Switzerland, inspiriting and gay ; but the strains of Italy seem to breathe the passion and poetry of its sunny clime, and appeal more directly to the heart and sensi bilities. The ice-cream saloons or cafes of Havanna are a favorite place of resort on the summer evenings. The principal one was very attrac tive ; a cool fountain in the centre, throwing"], [70, "64 HAVANA. up a single jet and falling in a million sparkling drops on a collection of rare flowers and shells, which lay surrounding its base, and glittering with spray, as if set with so many brilliants. Tlie ceiling was open, and far beyond could be seen the skies, faintly illumined by the moon, and gemmed with innumerable stars. Scattered over the tesselated marble floor were marble tables and seats, and marble pillars supported the arched and frescoed walls. The ices are very poor, and have only their coolness to recommend them. All foreigners that visit Havana consider it incumbent on them not to leave there without purchasing a pine-apple handkerchief and a Spanish fan (generally manufactured in Paris), and in consequence the hotel is hourly besieged with numerous venders of these articles. Among them I observed more than one Yankee ; this, however, is universally the case where trade is pushed with any amount of vigor. It is said that the day after the city of Mexico was taken, and entered in triumph by General Scott and his victorious army, me of this enterprising"], [71, "HAVANA. 65 race set up a gentlemen's furnishing store, next door to the halls of the Montezumas, and put out placards advertising \" gents' patent arm slings,\" and \" the only genuine gunshot-wound pain exterminator,\" warranted to cure at short est notice ! There was at the time naturally a great demand for these articles, and if that son of New England did not \" realise\" something it was owing to no lack of effort on his part. We visited a cigar manufactory, and saw \" the weed\" in every variety of form, and in every stage, from the original article, fresh from the fields, to the crisp little cigaritos, lying together in tempting bunches, and tied with yellow and crimson ribbons, in boxes labelled \" Santa Rosa,\" \" Opera,\" &c. &c.

The object that most attracted my attention, and left the deepest impression on my mind, while in Havana, was the tomb of Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of this island. Nearly four centuries have passed since then. It was within the last of these that his remains were removed from Spain to one of the minor West India islands, but found a final grave in Ha vana. This fair young world that revealed itself first to his enraptured vision, seems a more fitting resting-place for its discoverer than ungrateful Spain or the land that gave him birth.

As its palm-trees, that had brought with them so new and delightful a sensation, passed from my sight, I felt that with them a dream had vanished ; a bright scene had passed by in the panorama of existence. Two more days at sea, and we arrived where the dark and murky waters of the Mississippi empty themselves into the blue waves of the"], [76, "70 NEW ORLEANS. Mexican Gulf. At this point the dividing line of the waters was distinctly visible. The scenery as the boat entered the principal channel of the Mississippi is peculiarly dreary and desolate. Tlie sea-board on either side is covered with miles of low swampy green salt plains, with lagoons, or natural canals, cut in every direction. Tlie river pours itself into the sea, through three passes. I sujspose the reason why it is called the \" Father of Waters\" is, be cause it has so many little mouths to feed ! We paused at the mouth of the river for a few moments to take in the pilot, whose hut, situated on one of these dreary plains, seemed a concentration of all that was desolate. Nothing can be more dreary, solitary, or devoid of all life, than these wastes of marshy, low, flat lands \u2014 no vegetation but salt meadow grass in sight.

The planters along the river generally come here on a visit every winter, bringing their wives and daughters to enjoy the gaieties of this great metropolis. Bridal parties are wonder fully numerous.

As in almost all public assemblies in this newly forming world, ignorance and bad taste predominate. From hotel life more can be seen of New Orleans society than in other cities. A stranger can form no definite idea from it alone ; but judging from an evening's insight at a soiree musicale at the British Consul's, I should imagine it was very elegant in its tone. The Creole women dress beautifully ; their mode of coiffure is a study, rich glossy masses of hair rolled around their heads in classic and artistic style. The only drive of any importance in the neighborhood of New Orleans is the Shell Road, which terminates at Lake Ponchartrain, where the steamers start for Mobile. This drive offers 4"], [80, "74 NEW ORLEANS. but few attractions ; a canal runs on one side, and a ditch on the other. It is a great resort for \"fast\" men (for which New Orleans is cele brated), who here run their horses at large. The canal serves the double purpose of drain ing a neighboring marsh, and navigation. In fact, the whole surface of the land is, in a great measure, a marsh. At the cemetery, when they dig down two feet for a grave, they come to water.

I amused myself after dinner by conversing with a crowd of young, round-eyed, woolly headed darkies, whose teeth shone like rows of ripe Indian corn on the cob, and who, in spite of being as wild and timid as prairie hens, were induced by a small bribe to pour out in chorus some of the sweetest music I ever listened to. Their clear, fresh, untutored voices, blended in perfect harmony as they recounted, in spirited verse, an exciting raccoon hunt in better time than the best drilled choruses I had ever heard. An exquisite ear for music seems to be the peculiar gift of the negro.

How ever, we often judge of a place by the tone of our minds while there, and if these feelings can not be laid aside, it is hardly a fair test. We leave the town behind, and crossing about a mile of chapparal or prairie land, reach the beach ; a beach that throws that of Newport, and others that we have seen, far, far into the shade. It is twice their width, and can be driven on for a day, without meeting with any impediment. The only marks of life we see are an occa sional fisherman's temporary hut or shed, on that part in near vicinity to the town ; and further on, swarms of wild ducks, cranes, and other kinds of wild fowd, as well as clusters of mammoth turtles, in which way we easily ac counted for the soup at dinner. They lay bask ing in the hot sand, apparently enjoying life ex cessively in their own way.

That evening we left Galveston, with a glimpse of its melan choly beauties impressed on the pages of memo ry, like the trace of a sad and misty dream. At earliest dawn next morning we set sail, and at noon landed at Indianola, where we put off the remainder of our passengers. But few ever go further south in Texas, unless they go on especial business, or by orders of government.

The passengers for Indianola, and their nume rous articles of property, were conveyed to the shore, some distance, in small boats, as, from the peculiar formation of the harbor, it is peri lous for ships to enter in. Two more days at sea brought our old, leaky vessel in sight of the island of \" Brazos St. Jago\" (the arm of St. James), and found us most perilously lodged on a dangerous sand-bar in sight of land, where the vestiges of wrecks around seemed to warn us of what might be our fate, and of the death and destruction that looked us in the face. For six hours we lay in the breakers, with the calm blue, sunlit heavens, smiling down upon us, singular accompaniments for a wreck at sea, and yet we knew well that half the devasta tions around us had taken place under the same circumstances, and not in the midnight storm or under a clouded sky. The waves, as if from a whirlpool beneath, dashed upon the ship, striking us fearfully each time against the bar, producing a terrible shock, that seemed like warning from heaven of coming fate. Tlie cap tain and crew labored most manfully at their"], [96, "90 GALVESTON TEXAS. duties, but every other voice was hushed with eager anxiety. The scene around inspired any thing but hope of reaching land in safety, and assistance of small boats from the shore experi ence had often proved impossible. The sea around the vessel moaned \" like a monster pained.\" We sat all these hours on the deck, mechanically watching the sea gulls dipping their wings in the water, and the porpoise as it gave a leap through the air to plunge again, in an instant, into the wave. When death comes face to face with us unexpectedly, no matter what our horror of it may be, it is strange how indifferently we can look it in the face. Dur ing these frightful hours we traced with a glass countless wrecks that lay around. From the bar on which we lay to the shore the water was shallow, and only navigable for small boats. The harbor is filled with bars, which are con tinually shifting their position. This peculiarity is what renders it so perilous, and causes so many lives to be sacrificed in sight of land. Every imaginable vestige of wreck lay around, from the giant mast of some enormous ship to"], [97, "91 GALVESTON, TEXAS. that of the smallest trading schooner. All this gave to the barren, sandy shores, an air of gloom and desolation that words cannot de scribe. Our few fellow-passengers awaited with us in earnest watching to see what would come next. My Irish Abigail alone broke silence, by ejaculations to the Yirgin, in a brogue which was a painful jar to every one's feelings, and had I died there it would have been as a sin cere and disgusted Know Nothing ! Towards afternoon, when the excitement of hope had been subdued by the almost certainty of our worst fears being realized \u2014 with one bound and a loud glad shout of exultation, we were pushed across the bar, and at last safely cast anchor inside the harbor. In her next voyage, the Globe went to pieces on this same sand-bar, not a soul on board, except the cap tain, escaping. It now forms another vestige of a wreck to add new dreariness to this gloomy scene. The small boats were launched, and we were soon landed on the government docks of Brazos Island, where are a number of large wooden buildings, containing ammunition and"], [98, "92 GALVESTON, TEXAS. various government stores of provisions, clothing, &c, to be forwarded to answer demands from the various military stations on the river above. Tlie quartermaster and his family reside here, and we stayed at his house. That afternoon we spent with him in a row-boat fishing for our supper ; we caught a number of blue-fish, and of course cat-fish, as they are the especial luck of all amateur fishermen ! We caught nothing different from what we have at the north. Towards night as we went homewards over the moonlit waters, the cool breeze from the sea amply rewarded us for our unwonted exertions. That evening we sat on the piazza and saw the lights glimmering from Point Isabel, which lay directly opposite us on the Texas shore. It will be remembered as the scene of some of General Taylor's most important operations. It contains a few houses around Fort Polk, a field work thrown up by General Taylor's troops, at the commencement of the war. Between Point Isabel and Brownsville is an overland route of about twelve miles. Shell Island and Palm Island, both occupied by a few inhabitants, lay"], [99, "93 GALVESTON, TEXAS. before us in the sea ; Brazos Island looks like a bleak, barren sand-bank on a pretty extensive scale. In the year 1845, before Texas became a State of the Union, the Mexican government passed a law, that no one should attempt to settle here, as on several occasions, when such attempts had been made, a terrific storm had suddenly sprung up, and, dashing on the shore, had swept away every vestige of its inhabitants and their property, without leaving a trace behind of human habitation. It is now many years since such a storm has taken place, so that they have almost entirely passed from the memory of the present inhabitants of these regions. Government has run quite a risk in braving a repetition of one of these terrible and devas tating storms. It may lead to a too tardy regret. The present limited population are principally the employes of government at the store houses, and fishermen who supply the Browns ville market with bass, red and blue-fish, and an inferior kind of oyster, which is nevertheless regarded as a very great delicacy in the absence of others. I was very much amused at a new"], [100, "94 GALVESTON, TEXAS. species of hotel that I saw there ; it was formed of the wrecked hull of an enormous ship that had been cast ashore in a storm, and was firmly wedged in the sand. It had been repaired and rendered weather-proof by the mud and mortar generally made use of for building purposes in these primitive regions. A bar-room and eat ing-room formed the principal apartments, with several sleeping-rooms of limited area adjoin ing, which were the accommodations of the boarders. It was kept by an old woman and her pretty little granddaughter about twelve years old, who was receiving an education to fit her for the responsible situation of bar- maid to this \" Hotel (vraiment) Texan.\" We passed one afternoon and night on Brazos Island, and the next day started for Fort Brown, adjoining the town of Brownsville, Texas."], [101, "CHAPTER X. BRAZOS ST. JAGO. At ten o'clock the next morning the govern ment carriage or ambulance was at the door, and, bidding farewell to our host, we again resumed our journey. The day was warm, but a cool breeze came from the sea, and the sun kindly shut out its hottest rays from us by a screen of clouds. The first part of the drive lay along the seaboard of Brazos Island ; no rocks, nor the smallest traces of vegetation could be seen in the hot sand ; there was nothing to vary the monotony of the scene but vestiges of wrecks of all descriptions, remains of ships and schoon ers, that when gaily launched, brightly painted, and colors streaming, were looked upon with pride by their commander and crew, who little thought they would, ere long, be utterly dis abled, at the mercy of tempestuous winds,"], [102, "96 BRAZOS ST.

Frequently were we compelled to turn aside from our path to avoid some mammoth black ened mast that lay imbedded in the sand, im peding our way. The horses dragged for seve ral miles, slowly and wearily, through the heavy sands, till we came to the creek \" Boca Chica\" (little mouth), which separates Brazos Island from the main land. Here the horses were taken from the ambulance, which was then towed across the creek by the flat-boat, that served for a ferry ; it then returned for the horses, and finally for the passengers, making three tedious trips, while I sat on a dressing-case, in the sand, patiently watching the operation. The flat-boat could not come quite up to the dry land, so there were about twenty yards of shallow water to be passed before we could get to it. To my amazement I soon found myself being borne through the air like a baby in the arms of a great stalwart Texan (lie being knee deep in the water), until safely lodged in the boat, on a large Mexican poncho that their gal-"], [103, "BRAZOS ST. JAGO. 97 lantry had provided. The creek was over a quarter of a mile wide, and was a good deal swollen at this season by recent rains. When we arrived at the other side we were obliged to wait there a while to rest the horses. We went into a kind of rancho, or hut, to sit down. It was the home of the boatman and his wife, wdio resided here, and the only house for miles around ; it appeared very lonely, even to a transient guest, being on the banks of the creek, with nothing but sand and water in sight. The interior was quite spacious, and was divided into apartments by rough canvass or sailcloth curtains. All the surroundings, however, to an eye unaccustomed to \" roughing it,\" bore an aspect of misery and abject suffering. When on our way home we again stopped here, this wayside hut, with a roof over it, appeared (comparatively speaking) really a comfortable abode, we had seen so many worse ones. In a conversation with the woman who lived here, she told her history (which was but slightly more eventful than that of Canning's Knife- Grinder) ! 5"], [104, "98 BRAZOS ST. JAGO. The \"halcyon days\" of her youth had been passed principally on the canal. Since that she had lived in all parts of the Western States, and finally had reached this barren spot, on the confines of civilization. She bore the traces of some former beauty ; her eyes were very sad, and so was her smile. I asked her if she was not lonely ? she said that peace was enough to satisfy her, and she had that where she was. Her chief occupation was raising chickens for the Brownsville market. She showed me a brood of fifty, with one old hen, all crowded in a bandbox, and kept on a shelf, to keep them from running in the creek, she said. By the aid of plenty of meal and a scanty supply of light and air, she assured me she raised the fattest chickens in market ! but I should not have cared to eat any of these extra plethoric* or dropsical poultry ! By the time the investigation of this natural phenomenon was finished, our horses were rest ed and at the door awaiting us. We bid our hostess farewell, and proceeded on our way. From this point we struck a north-westerly"], [105, "BRAZCS ST. JAGO. 99 direction towards Brownsville, crossing a beau tiful chapparal, which, owing to an accidental irrigation from the overflow of the river above, formed a spot of verdure but seldom seen in this region of country. It was thick with flow ering shrubs and wild flowers. Each scraggy, ebony tree lodged in its branches myriads of brilliant tropical birds, Avhose sweet-toned melodies filled the soft air that floated around us, with music. Another hour's drive took us to the borders of the Rio Grande or Rio Bravo del Norte, a still, monotonous stream, that flowed sluggishly along, its muddy waters giv ing, however, a refreshing sensation to the tra veller on its almost invariably parched and arid banks. The first impressions of this river reminded me of the descriptions I had read and imagined of Egypt and the Nile. It only wanted a few swarthy, turbaned men, and a sphynx or two, to complete the illusion. As we left the banks of the river (which, in its winding course, struck far away from our more direct road to Brownsville), we came on"], [106, "100 BRAZOS ST. JAGO. to the ground which was the scene of the battle of Palo Alto, situated on a tract which nature seemed designedly to have thrown up for the purposes of a drill ground. This formation is not, however, as conspicuous in this region of country as it might be in another place ; for the whole surface of the land is laid out in low, sandy ridges, the vegetation stinted, and the soil scanty. The cactus and other plants indige nous and peculiar to a sandy soil, grow in luxu riant beauty. Occasionally relics of the battle are picked up, but there remain few traces to tell of \" wrar's alarms.\" The oriole boldly lights on the low flowering bushes, knowing no fear in these rarely interrupted solitudes, where the sounds of the wilderness alone break the still ness of the air. The contrast of this peaceful scene with the previously conceived idea of this famous battle-field was very striking. It had been associated with the sound of booming guns, gallant charges, and groans of wounded and dying men. Many that I had known, treading with mar tial step the romantic plain of West Point, had"], [107, "BRAZOS ST. JAGO. 101 here found a soldier's grave, among the unfor gotten dead.

And if we fail to mark those spots where heroes fall with tablets that tell of their gallant deeds, it is not only wronging them, but wronging generations yet unborn, by allowing them to forget how pre cious the purchase-money that bought their freedom. Our horses paused here to allow us to take luncheon, which, when it came to be unpacked, consisted of a cold beefsteak and bread, wrapped in a newspaper ; anything but a tempting re past, and, although famishing with hunger, I politely but firmly declined participating in it. About three miles before we came to Fort Brown we passed a deep ravine, the scene of the battle of Resaca de la Palma (the field of palms), which could not have taken its name from any of these trees, as there was not even one specimen to be seen.

Soon we drove in sight of Fort Brown, ana up the principal street of Brownsville to the gates of the garrison. The aspect of this curious, half-breed town, was very novel. It is what they call in Texas \" quite a settlement.\" A mixed population of Americans and Mexicans formed a contrast at once striking and amusing. On the one hand the red brick stores, and white frame shops and buildings of every de scription, bore the marks of inevitable progress, or go-aheadativeness, otherwise called \" mani fest destiny ;\" while the rudely constructed huts, or hackals, composed of rustic straw work, or mud bricks called adobes, in which there is generally but one apartment, where frequently are found five generations living together, ek ing out an indolent existence on a mild diet of"], [111, "FORT BROWN 105 ground corn, eggs, and milk, exhibited unmis takable evidence of a vanishing people, who in a few years will know no nationality. These Mexicans lead a truly primitive life, reminding us of \"shepherd days\" in young world's history. In one of the huts, built on four posts, with thatched straw walls, I witnessed on one occasion, with mingled horror and amusement, quite a new phase in barber-ism ! It could not be called hair-dressing, yet might be regarded as a peculiar species of shampooing. An old crone seated on a wooden bench, was cleansing the locks of a small child, while a young girl performed the same kindly offices for the old woman \u2014 the whole party talking and laughing merrily. Further description, or even a shade more minuteness in detail, would be impossible. Suf ficient to say, the performance had more vitality connected with it than is usually displayed by Mexicans. Yermin are the scourge of this country, and cleanliness certainly not one of its virtues. This 5*"], [112, "106 FORT BROWN. portion of the world may be set down as the birthplace of the flea ; those found in other parts are merely occasional wanderers from this, their native land ! Here they roam at large, the torment, par excellence, of the human race, in consequence of which carpets are eschewed, as they are apt to furnish a resort for scores of fleas, as well as other vermin of the country. Cane furniture, matting, and the indispensable mosquito bar, are the only articles in general use ; anything more elegant seldom reaches here, and is not required. We found at Brownsville quite a respectable, well educated class of Americans, who gave an entertainment while we were there, in honor of certain strangers in town. The Mayor called to invite the officers of the garrison of Fort Brown, and their families, to the soiree to be given at \" the Gem,\" the principal cafe of the place. Of course we accepted the invitation, went at nine o'clock, and found the affair had commenced already. A fine band of stringed instruments, and a certain air of deference and respect in the man ners of the men, were something I had not ex-"], [113, "107 FORT BROWN. pected to find. The waltzing was very grace ful. Several Spanish ladies from the old Mexi can city of Matamoras were present, who seemed to swim in the graceful, languid motion of the deux temps, as if they had never heard of the hopping of the polka and redowa, which rather frantic style of dancing certainly seems better adapted to the Jardin Mabille, or some grisettes' ball, than to the dame comme il faut. Wall-flowers are an unknown shrub in this part of the country ; the men have too much giillantry to allow them to flourish, even if acci dentally transplanted here from colder climes. I had once doubted the existence of those mythical beings called \"nature's noblemen,\" but my stay in Texas relieved my mind fr.om all uncertainty on the subject, for I found no lack of polish and courtesy, although the coun try is so newly settled.

Traces of a beau tiful artificial lake, with an island in its centre, still remain, and also a ruined summer-house, with luxuriant vines creeping wherever they can find a support to cling to, as the pillars that they once clambered over have probably long ere this lighted a fire, to cook some ranchero's meal, or floated down the sullen waters of the Rio Grande. In 1S48 Brownsville contained but two houses, or rather shanties ; two years after, it had four thousand inhabitants, was laid out into streets, with a number of brick build ings, and a fine market-house, with a large pub lic hall above it. It is duly incorporated, and now has a mayor and other municipal officers, and a weekly newspaper.

Tlie rush of fortune-hunters to California gave so wide a vent to the enterprising, that it prevented the increase of the population of Brownsville that would otherwise have taken place. Thirty miles east of the town is a lake, from which large quantities of salt are annually ob tained. In 1852 when we were there, there was no church, and but one preacher. This individual was a wandering Presbyterian, who after having collected an ample subscription from the people, for the purpose of building a church, invested it in a parsonage, built on a lot of his own ground . and after safely lodging in it his wife and a dozen or more of his pious offspring, began mak ing preparations for another collection, to build the church. This time, however, the people of Brownsville, seeing that he acted so entirely on the principle of \" charity beginning at home,\" were more wary, and the church remains un built to this day.

The further you remove from civilization, the more warm-hearted the persons you meet seem, and hospitality, like contentment, gives charms, even to \" a dinner of herbs.\" This is easily accounted for. In a large community, there are so many calls on our sympathy and good will, that, naturally, they cannot be responded to as heartily as in a place out of the world, where such demands are more rare. We made a good many excursions about the country. One day we crossed the river, and spent a day at Matamoras. This place is asso ciated with the siege of Fort Brown, during the Mexican war. Its old stone dwellings, and ca thedral, whose cracked chimes float daily on the evening and morning air, with its heavy masonry and antiquated air, seem to bear us back to past centuries when the Spaniards brought from gor geous Spain some of the attributes of regal gran deur, and planted them in the wilderness of a for eign land.

This anomalous"], [118, "112 FORT BROWN. combination produces an effect at once pleasing and the contrary. We feel how necessary a high cultivation of the mind is to a union so fascinating and so defective. For beyond ac companying herself on the mandolin, as she sings the national ditties of Spain, and embroidering the exquisite needle-work of Mexico, she is ut terly devoid of either moral or literary culture. While at Matamoras, we saw the funeral pro cession of the resident Spanish Consul, to which the American officers had received a formal and courteous invitation ; many of them were present. He was of the Roman faith, and his funeral services were attended with all the pomp and forms of that church. The carriage that we were in drew up to the side of the road, as the procession passed in solemn silence, the only sounds the low chanting of the priests and the tramp of the feet of the funeral train. The priests came first, in full regalia, bearing the host, followed by boys in white and crimson attire, holding lighted torches, and burning incense ; then came the coffin, borne on the shoulders of six men, and covered with a heavy"], [119, "FORT BROWN. 113 black velvet pall, with deep gold fringe.

In fact, the earliest records we have of the history of Mexico and Texas are derived from those remarkable men, half priest, half soldier, who after aiding in the subjugation of the Aztecs, spread themselves almost single-handed over a vast extent of country, uninhabited save by numerous tribes of savages, whose very ex istence was unknown to each other. Led on by visions as brilliant as those of Cortez, fired equally by religious zeal and ambition, these modern crusaders braving danger with more than military ardor, and meeting death with the martyr's enthusiasm, with their numbers dimi nished and still decreasing, pressed on until they penetrated into the heart of the continent, where for centuries the wild idolator had offered sacri fice on the altar of an unknown God. Descend ing the water courses to the Gulf of Mexico, they sought with the cross in one hand, and the 6word in the other, to colonize the nomadic tribes that roamed at large over the wide prai ries of Texas. The history of their proceedings is full of interest, although the records are few and limited in detail. Time and again their"], [121, "FORT BROWN. 115 efforts were frustrated, and the daring adven turers paid to their enterprise the forfeit of their lives. Occasionally a straggling survivor found his way back to Mexico, after passing through every description of danger, travelling solitary and on foot over hundreds of miles of prairie. Their mournful tidings, however, served but to in crease the ardor for conquest. Success seemed at length to crown these continued efforts, and a number of flourishing missions were eventually established in the valley of the upper Rio Grande, and formed the nucleus of what are now considerable towns. These missions were generally under the supervision of the priests, one of whom attended to the religious ceremo nies, while the other collected the Indians, and instructed them in agriculture, the use of imple ments, &c. In these tasks they were assisted by parties of already civilized Indians, who had accompa nied them from Mexico. At first the converts were supported by the mission, which in return received their labor. As soon as they were"], [122, "116 FORT BROWN. deemed competent to provide for themselves, a portion of ground was allotted to them, and in this way a village sprang up around each mis sion. For several years these little commu nities remained undisturbed, each year adding to their number, and increasing their resources. Yet, while reposing in fancied security, an un seen storm was gathering around them. The wily savages of the plains, true to the instinct of their untamable and rapacious natures, only waited for a fitting opportunity to sweep down upon the settlements and annihilate them. Not content with plundering them of everything they could carry away, they ruthlessly mur dered all wdio could be found, and the missions were for a time abandoned. We cannot fail to regret that so little of the heroic and religious zeal of these first priests remains to inspire their followers. Just outside of the town of Brownsville are the grounds of the garrison of Fort Brown, the spot from whence General Taylor bombarded Matamoras. Its well kept fences, and regularly placed barracks and buildings, with the vine-"], [123, "117 FORT BROWN. covered cottages that form the officers' quar ters, add in no small degree to the beauty and importance of Brownsville ; while the daily guard-mountings, parades, and drills, and the accompanying military music, add greatly to the feelings of safety and importance of its citi zens. While at Fort Brown I saw a soldier from the ranks drummed out of the service for theft. It was a very novel and amusing sight. He had his head shaved, and his military coat, hat, and accoutrements taken from him \u2014 his blue pantaloons, with the red stripe of the artillery, he alone retained to show his former calling. At evening parade he was called in front of the ranks, and publicly dismissed, the officer of the day reading his crime and its penalty, aloud, in full. He was then obliged to walk three times around the parade-ground, with the corporal and sergeant of the guard following him closely with bayonets pointed downward, -the lifer and two drummers following, playing \"right mer rily\" the tune of \" Poor Old Soldier, I hope the devil won't catch you,\" a gay, mocking air,"], [124, "118 FORT BROWN. reserved especially for occasions of this kind. He put on a regular Jack Sheppard or Dick Turpin swagger, and in passing the command ing officer's quarters, .shouted out to a group there assembled for a subscription for a wig. A prick from the two bayonets soon put him in mind of his flagrant breach of respect, but it did not seem to cure him, as on his last tour he called to the orderly of the day, who stood with military bearing and a wooden face, \" Good bye, Tom ! God bless you, my son !\" The or derly's face became still more wooden and un responsive at this remark, as in duty bound, and a severe prick from the guard produced another strong reminder of duty. At the gate of the garrison he was ejected, and went off probably to buy himself a wig ! \u2014 while the guard marched rapidly back to the guard-house, followed by the fifer and the drummers playing the tune of \" The Dashing White Sergeants\" a sound inspiriting enough to give the soldier fresh strength on the weariest march, or call the most lagging recruit to his post."], [125, "CHAPTER XII.

We were the only passengers on board. The accommodations were very fine, as there were only two state rooms, and they four times the usual size, and quite sumptuously furnished. We spent four days in our sail up the river, which runs in a singularly serpentine course ; at times, the windings form almost a complete circle. Sand-bars were very numerous, and (to use a technical local phrase) we \" stuck\" a num bers times on the way, going through the pro cess of several hours' tugging and pushing each time before we were able to continue our voyage, which, had it not been for its novelty, might have proved tedious."], [126, "120 THE RIO BRAVO DEL NORTE. About half way up the river, we came to a settlement, on the American side, called Edin burgh. A thieving Scotchman had built a house here, and patriotically called it after his native place, which he had probably left in a hurry ! A few Mexicans have clustered around him, and it is now a stopping-place for the occasional flat-boats that go up and down the river, with lumber, provisions, &c. The only notice we took of its existence as a city was by flinging a package of papers ashore from the mail bag as we passed it. Not far above this, we were suddenly alarmed by the dreadful cry of \" the Camanches ! the Ca manches!\" and a momentary pang of terror was felt by the stoutest heart on board. Their rifles were aimed at our \"great canoe with pinions,\" and several harmless shots pene trated different objects on deck. _ We returned the fire, and most fortunately heard no more from them. They were probably bound on other errands of destruction and death. The story of the dreadful crimes which they"], [127, "TnE RIO BRAVO DEL NORTE. 121 practise on the inhabitants of this region will form a fearful page in history. There could not be a blacker record of infamy and rapacionsness. The Camanche Indian possesses no vestige of the noble traits attributed to the red men of the north west. At the best, he enjoys the mere intelligence, or rather instincts, of the brute ; these instincts are all that guide him. He is bloody, brutal, licentious, and an innate thief. Civilization will probably never reach him, as his feelings towards the white men are those of implacable hatred. Their blood he demands, and takes every occasion to obtain it. With the terrible sound of his name, the Mexican mother strikes terror to the soul of her wayward child. In fact, he may be looked upon as \" the black man in the coal-hole\" of more civilized lands. Actual extermination seems to suggest itself as the only remedy against this scourge.. Nothing less will render many portions of the State of Texas a safe abode for white settlers.

The tribe resides further north than the Rio Grande, but roving parties are continu ally coming down for depredation and murder. They are wonderful horsemen, more in their natural element on a horse's back than any where else. An Indian child is put on horse back before it can walk, with a cord around the horse's neck, and taught to guide it with its feeble strength, more adroitly than can be readily imagined. The women ride astride, and are quite as fearless riders as the men. Their favor ite sport is to lasso wild horses, which they do with great expertness. A band of mounted Camanches in full chase after a drove of wild horses, with their manes flying in the wind, is said to be an intensely exciting 6ight. The Indian lassos his horse, jumps on the wild, res tive creature's back, and remains there till he is in a measure broken in. They say, among the Indians, that in break ing a horse's spirit they break his heart, and he does not live long ; consequently, they always endeavor to catch colts, as \" breaking in \" has always been found to be more successful during"], [129, "123 THE RIO BRAVO DEL NORTE. the tender period of youth than in maturer years, in human beings as well as wild horses ! Horse-stealing from the Mexicans is an im portant branch of their business. He who steals the greatest number of horses is regarded as the greatest man in the tribe.

If for horses we read dollars, I fear we should have a peculiar fact in regard to more enlightened communities ! Government has, at different times, organized parties, and sent them up to the principal camping grounds of the tribe. But the great sachem and chief men have disclaimed all con nexion with these marauding parties, placing them in the light of filibusters, beyond their control.

The night before we arrived at the point of our final destination, the steamer pushed towards the shore, and we tied up for the night at a Mexican ranche, as at this point in the river sailing by night was considered dangerous.

The men who had returned from the chase or from the fields lay about on the ground, or leaned lazily over the fence, talking to the women who were milking a flock of goats, and some cows that the children had just driven in from their scanty pasturage in the chapparal.

He makes the plough he uses, which is a sharp-pointed log, with a pole at one end by which it is guided, and one at the other by which it is drawn.

After planting he starts out on the prairie to lasso wild horses and cattle, and if he escapes the Camanche, he generally brings home a supply of stock for the ensuing year.

This being the only mode of communication that these exiles have with their kind, the arrival of a mail and newspapers from the world beyond is na turally an important occurrence.

A soldier officiated as cook, and with the occasional assistance of a drummer-boy as scullion, divided the labors of the household, with which I never dreamed of interfering. It was May when we reached there, and we were plunged into a tropical summer, which would have been unendurable had it not been for the delightfully cool nights, when a sea breeze, full of the fresh aroma of the ocean, would spring up. During the heat of the day, aggravating visions of Newport would at times come across me, but in spite of all inconveni ences novelty is so charming that I found a great deal to enjoy in this new land ; the cli mate was very salubrious, and cholera almost unheard of.

By September it consisted of a fawn, two goats, a flock of doves, a brood of chickens, a parrot, four dogs of different kinds, several mocking birds, and some orioles, to_say nothing of a tiger cub, of whom I had a mortal fear, who was kept chained, and poked at, and fed on raw meat by our faithful negro, who took these judicious means of taming him !

We could not extend our rides very far from the gar rison, on account of the frequent close neighbor hood of the Camanches. The only safe ride was a racecourse just outside of the govern ment grounds. We made many unsuccessful efforts to get a horse that would go in a wagon, and one day heard of a pair that were to be sold, which had been ridden down from Northern Texas"], [140, "134 RINGGOLD BARRACKS. across the prairies, and were used up, by being overworked on the road. Their owner, a rough Texan, now offered them for sale. One died before we got there, and the other ! A mere ver bal description can never do him justice !

He took it literally \" under his wing,\" where it slept at night. He picked food for it, providing it with grasshoppers, spiders, and other delica cies. One was never to be seen without the other; they presented quite a touching sight, even if they were only chickens. Their final fate was a sad one !

Sometimes an Indian hunter would ride up to the door with a whole deer, even the skin and antlers, and scores of prairie hens, and game of every kind, hanging in the rear. At such times there was nothing to complain of, but at others, if a piece of kid or rabbit, or a few turnips (sold for a real, or a shilling apiece), could be obtained, it was looked upon as almost too good fortune to be real. At one period, which I shall never forget, the quartermaster's stores were reduced to mouldy flour and rancid pork, two luxuries that are not generally very highly appreciated, even by the unfastidious.

It was during this time, when sickness and \"les vapeurs noirs\" confined me to the house, that my poor little friend, the chicken and the forlorn little one that he had befriended, were transformed into an ignoble fricassee. They were not roasted, out of respect to my feelings, as by their difference of size (which was marked) I might have recognised them! No instinct warned me that I was partaking of my friends.

I was afterwards told the particulars of their fate : As our resources diminished for supplying the table, the eyes of our colored dependant fixed themselves on this loving pair, who, how-"], [145, "139 RINGGOLD BARRACKS. ever, fought manfully and sagaciously for their lives, \u2014 three successive days retiring under the house just before the very hour of execution arrived, with an intelligent expression of \" no, you don't,\" on their pointedly expressive faces. Finally, they were cut off while in the arms of Morpheus (if Morpheus admits poultry into those precincts!), and formed the above men tioned dish.

The lazy Mexicans lie around in the sun, with large open baskets spread out be fore them, containing the most untempting mer chandise, of scanty vegetables, goat's flesh, and beef, cut in strips and dried in the sun. This they sell by the yard ; so that a person, in going to market, is afforded a convenient way of mea suring accurately the appetite of those he has to provide for! The cakes and confectionery \u2014 made of flour, lard, and molasses \u2014 are disagree able even to look at. Their taste it is impossible to imagine. Tlie fandango court-yard here, as in all towns where Mexican habits at all prevail, is one of the chief attractions, and forms one of its prin cipal features ; a square inclosure, with three sides benches, and one side booths, where dancing, drinking, and gambling are kept up the greater part of the night. On the outskirts of the town the people are annually fencing in new corn fields, so that in"], [155, "DAVIS'S RANCHE. 149 spite of the barrenness of the land, the place looks quite thriving, having somewhat that as pect of fresh invigorating progress so generally found among our young and vigorous people, who, like poor \" Joe Allalone,\" are always \" moving on, moving on.\" A billiard room, an eating saloon, a bakery, and even a \" pharmacie,\" with a most preten tious soda water fountain, are found here. All these attractions and comparative luxuries render it a place of great importance in this part of Texas. This was a great rendezvous for filibusters, among whom could be found more true-souled honesty and genuine generosity than many would be led to suppose. Many a dare-devil Texan would scorn the paltry meanness, and fire at the acts of fraud perpetrated by friend on friend which are of not unfrequent occurrence in our civilized me tropolis.

They follow different callings, from the scout to the office-holder under the Government, but there exist no false distinc tions among them. A man stands simply on his own merits. The word blase, or the idea con veyed by it, is unknown. Fresh as nature around them, their hearts beat true to the call of friendship, and respect for women seems an innate principle, wdiile daring and bravery are no second nature, but nature itself. The chances of life are so continually perilled that it creates a recklessness unknown to us purchasers of life-preservers, who repose in the security of a private watch ! Our rides,' on account of the climate, always took place towards evening. The twilight here is very short, day at its decline merging sudden ly into darkness. The horses always took the same direction, the road that lay between the garrison and the ranche. It was a beaten cattle track, cut through the chapparal, forming part of what had once been a race-ground used by the officers during the late war, when sta tioned opposite here at Camargo."], [157, "davis's ranche. 151 In these rides we frequently met a peaceable peasant driving home his flock of goats for their evening milking, or a band of huntsmen wrapped in gay blankets, bright ribbons streaming from their sombreros, returning from the day's chase with the game hung over their horses' backs. We were obliged to ride slowly on account of the heavy, deep sand, and thickly growing briers and cacti which ran all over the ground. Walk ing was impossible, even if the scorpions, taran tulas, and venomous snakes lurking in the scanty vegetation, had been more rare. There never was a country more unfitted by nature to be the home of civilized man, than this region of the lower Rio Grande in Texas. It seems to hate civilization. Everything looks discouragingly on the settler, refusing to smile on his most earnest efforts, pointing with a grim and solemn aspect to those flowery plains of the North where encouragement and plenty await him. It seems only to be intended as a home for desperate men, escaped refugees from the law; men who live in the saddle, and on the prairie seek their subsistence; such as"], [158, "152 davis's ranche. give to Texas any bad reputation its population m.ay have. In this wild region deeds are sometimes enacted which make the blood run cold to read of ; yet we should bear in mind the vast extent of the country, and not judge of the character of the State by the isolated acts of a roving population. The Americans on the Rio Grande may be considered as the most daring, adventurous set of men in the world. Actuated solely by the reckless spirit of adventure and restless love for the new and exciting, many of their lives present scenes of peril which none could encounter unless possessed of iron nerve, and which have left upon their souls the impress of a new nature. The history of each differs from the other, yet throusrh the character of all there runs a tinge of romance and chivalry which cannot fail to excite our admiration, although we might wish to see these strong energies directed to a better purpose. They are essentially a peculiar race, with"], [159, "davis's ranche. 153 marked individualities belonging to them alone. Their innate nobility and high-toned sense of honor resemble more the days of Ivanhoe and Richard C\u0153ur-de-Lion, than our more modern acceptation of the term. The early pioneers of all our Western State were restless spirits from the colonies who, as civilization advanced, and the first settlements became thickly populated, possessing many of the restraints and few of the advantages of European cities, pushed onward into the wilder ness to find, like Robin Hood and his \" merrie men,\" a home in the forest glade, their sole com panionship nature in her varied forms of beauty. Civilization, as it has followed them, has urged them, like the red men, westward. Familiar and hourly intercourse with nature has given them a tone of mind differing widely from the men of the East, who would amaze them by their \"business tact\" as much as they in their turn astonish these sons of trade by their hardy enduring lives of self-exposure and pri vation. Since we left Texas, there has been a great 7*"], [160, "154 davis's ranche. overflow in the Rio Grande, and everything green has flourished. The crops have been very luxuriant. They however have been com pelled to pay for this a high price, as the fever and ague has become very prevalent in con sequence, \" the shakes\" (as they call this malady all over the newly settled portions of the West) preventing in a measure the enjoyment of this unwonted luxuriance and plenty. While we were there the climate was very salubrious, in fact famously so ; the winter days were as soft, and warm, and balmy as at the Havana. The summer-heat indeed would have been almost unbearable, were it not for the cool refreshing night breezes. In the rainy season the river is apt to over flow its banks, and leave numerous little lakes and large pools wherever there is a depres sion of the ground. The soil prevents rapid absorption, and causes these to remain for weeks. In them the Mexican women can be seen at any hour of the day washing clothes, while their little naked children are splashing in the water in great glee, or lying asleep on the bare"], [161, "davis's ranche. 155 ground, under a shady bush, like so many little animals. On ordinary occasions the river is used for lavatory purposes, and women washing their clothes on the banks, while others spread them on the brush-wood to dry, form a very pretty scene. Towards evening it is full of bathers, men, women, and children. They swim with pe culiar agility, more like water-fowl in their fear less divings, than human beings. By driving about the country among the peasantry, at whose huts we always stopped to inquire if they had anything to sell, we became very well known among them. I finally com menced looking upon them as a new circle of friends and acquaintances. They are an amiable, smiling, innocent race of people, utterly unconscious of the higher emotions of civilization save the feeling of sympathy in misfortune, which pervades all classes of Mexicans. So universal is this sentiment that the bit terest enemy, in the hour of trouble, will"], [162, "156 davis's ranche. receive care and attention. The well known devotion of the Mexican women to the sick and wounded of our army during the war, finds no parallel in history; and their love, whether for friend or lover, when once kindled, is flame in all but its short-livedness. This lovely trait of sympathy is evident in the commonest intercourse. Their overflowing kind ness of purpose, that shows itself in every trifle, has left on my memory an indelible impression of kindness towards this innocent, warm-hearted race. Yet, mild and inoffen sive as they usually are, they have enough Spanish blood left in their veins to be occa sionally roused to deeds of desperation and bloodshed. The white complexion of an American and blue eyes are their beau-ideal of beauty, in contrast to their own dark skins and black eyes ; but a negro they regard as the climax of loveliness ! The more ebon his complexion, the woollier his locks, the more claim he has on their admiration ! On the Lower Rio Grande there are no"], [163, "davis's ranche. 157 slaveholders ; the close neighborhood of Mexico renders escape so easy that no slaves are ever brought here. Our colored dependent, the only specimen of his race in these parts, was -very much petted by the Mexican peasant women (who literally adore the sons of Africa) ! The effects of this appreciation were soon visible ! as I was relieved from the somewhat arduous duty of directing frequent billets (they could not be called h\\\\\\ets-doux, as they were perfumed with a professional odor of pepper !) to a certain \"Miss Georgianna, care of Julius Johnston, White-washer, Myrtle Alley, Brooklyn\" ! who was thus unfeelingly abandoned for the sake of a certain little sallow, black-eyed Ninetta Garcia. I spoke to him one day with regard to his unfaith fulness as a correspondent. \" I guess how's she disremembers me, I ben gone so long\" ! replied this colored \" man of the world.\" Ninetta, in the excess of her devotion, paid frequent visits to the garrison, where, with enamored eyes, she would stand at the kitchen door and watch the object of her affection at his various and nume rous employments, presuming that when they"], [164, "158 davis's ranche. were ended he would go to the fandango. Very little conversation took place between them, and that little in a language called \"Mex,\" a kind of Spanish patois, differing widely from pure Castiliau ! This admira tion for negroes somewhat disgusted me with the Mexicans, for, in spite of philanthropy, Christian charity, and liberal views, I do not believe that the colored and white races can ever by any possibility amalgamate to an equality ! The different degrees of instinct in different races of the animal kingdom, the different degrees of beauty and utility in the different classes of the vegetable kingdom, seem a sufficient reason to believe that these same dis tinctions have been made in the different races of the human family. In one of our drives we stopped at the ranche of an old Mexican, where we had several times before been supplied by his daughter with eggs and poultry. He had always been away at the chase, but on this occasion we found him at home ; he came"], [165, "davis's ranche. 159 out to speak to \" la donna Americana\" ! who his daughter said was at the door. I noticed that he kept one of his eyes tightly closed, which gave such a droll and roguish expression to his old wrinkled face, that I could not help laughing, in which (although not knowing the cause) he heartily joined, probably from sympathy! I put my finger on my eye, as a sign to ask him why he kept it closed so rigidly? This seemed to amuse the old fellow amazingly (he was past eighty), and in the glee of second childhood he had to sit down to laugh, saying, when he had recovered himself sufficiently to do so \u2014 \"Los Indios, senorita, los Indios;\" mean ing that his eye had been shot out by a Caman che's arrow \u2014 rather a serious joke, I thought ! His name was \" Chico.\" When quite a boy, he had been captured by the Indians, who took him up among them, picked out his eyebrows, shaved his head, and finally imbued him so thoroughly with a taste for their wild mode of life that when he was recaptured by the Mexi cans, some eighteen years afterwards, he was"], [166, "davis's ranche. 160 quite loth to remain among them.

If any Divine influ ence prevails it is through the instrumentality of the Roman church. On the anniversary of \" All Saints' Day,\" we met a curious procession in the streets of Rio Grande City, carrying bright-colored banners and flags, followed by two men bearing a long pole, on which were strung a number of wooden dolls, dressed in a most grotesque manner, wearing turbans orna mented with mangy feathers, evidently lately purloined from some unfortunate chicken's tail ! These \"graven images\" represented the differ ent patron saints of Mexico. Two musicians came after them, one with a drum, and another with a squeaking fiddle, playing jigs and other lively airs, probably intended to promote reli-"], [168, "162 FRONTIER PIETT, ETC gious enthusiasm ! Tlie rear was brought up by a mongrel crowd of Mexican women, babies, In dia-rubber or no-haired dogs, and dirty children, who were thus receiving their earliest religious impressions ! ' In spite of its absurdity the sight was truly pitiful. There was a current, and generally believed report, that the postmaster of Rio Grande City was a good Baptist, the only man in the set tlement who owned a Bible, in consequence of which he had acquired the familiar cogno men of \" Bible-back,\" a name that he stoutly resented ! He said the Bible belonged to his wife ; but he had a brother in Northern Texas who had \"got religion and done well\" and he thought \" some \" of \" getting it \" himself!

They seem to adapt themselves better to their capacities, which may be accounted for by their being a less highly educated class of men than those of the Episcopal church, and assimilating better with the ordinary mind in consequence. It is a peculiar fact, and one worthy of notice, that since Texas has become a State the Episco pal church has looked in vain for a man to fill the bishopric, while in every portion of this country there is more need of good influence than in any of those lands where vain endeavors and enormous sums of money are annually ex pended on barbaric tribes who have but little in tellect to cultivate, and who generally evince their gratitude for religious instruction by eating their instructors !

The heroic examples of old seem to have no power to inspire those who look upon their com mission in the ranks of God's service as a worldly profession, and calculate the income it will yield ! forgetting the glorious example of John, who preached in the wilderness, clothed in camel's hair, with wild honey for his food. There is a wilderness now as then to preach in, with the finest wild-cat skins, and wild honey like ambrosia ! Every one has his destined vocation.

It is very easy to know and preach the right course ; but, I sup pose, it is not so easy to acquire the necessary strength of mind to adopt it and go to Texas for life. Human nature is so continually at war with the divine instinct, that all of us (divinity students included) have constantly to contend against those outside influences which too often"], [171, "FRONTIER PIETY, ETC. 165 turn the scale. As Spenser said two hundred yeare ago : \" Aye me, how many perils doe enfold The righteous man, to make him daily fall1 Although principle may at times have due weight, yet circumstances generally make the villain or the saint, which may account for the fact of Texas being comparatively deserted by the professed soldiers of the Lord. Just at the rear of Davis's ranche, backed by a high sandy ridge, there was a long low adobe hut. It had a door in the centre, and two small grated windows placed near the roof. It was the jail or city prison. We had occa sion once to seek a person in its vicinity ; meeting there an acquaintance, \" one in autho rity,\" I begged that we might go inside to see what was in there. I never made even an un reasonable request in vain in Texas, where the men are so gallant, and my wish was soon granted. We entered the central apartment, a kind of square hall, lighted from a window in the rear, which was occupied by the jailor; two"], [172, "166 FRONTIER PIETY, ETC. other apartments opened from it on either side, which formed the cells for the prisoners. Both were occupied. In one was a Mexican, a me lancholy-looking youth, sitting on a stone bench, his head resting on his hands, his dishevelled locks and sad eyes the personification of mild despair. Looking upon him as a physiognomist, I should have judged him to be a person oi sweet disposition and quite inoffensive. But appearances are generally deceitful, and in this case they certainly were. He had performed a prominent part quite recently in a real tra gedy. He and a companion had been fellow-travel lers from Roma, a town a few miles off. Feel ing sanguinary during the night, on account of some dispute relative to the dried beef they were bringing with them to Rio Grande City to sell, he, Jael-like, had driven a butcher's knife into his friend's head, leaving it there as a token of the strength of his feelings towards him ! and went on with his merchandise alone. A party of merchants coming the same road a few hours after, discovered the body and se-"], [173, "167 FRONTIER PIETY, ETC. cured the murderer, and he was here awaiting his sentence and final doom. After hearing this story I began to discover (with the eye of a physiognomist !) a doggedly wicked look of cruelty about him, and my pity vanished with it. In the other cell there was a person of a very different description. He was a fine intelligent looking American, who on \" a spree\" had killed another man. He said that since the morning he had awaked to find himself a murderer, he had felt that he could never raise his head again. While my companions were in the oppo site cell, I had a chance to hear all his woes in detail, and how dear life now appeared to him from the threshold of the grave, &c. &c. He was a most interesting specimen of a criminal. I suggested to him a way to escape by tearing down a fallible part of the opposite wall, and as we left wished him success in his efforts, in the face of the officials, who, much to my dis gust, instead of sternly trying to silence me, smiled good-naturedly. That night Bacchus offered temptations to the"], [174, "168 A GRAVEYARD. jailor, to which, as many a good man has done before and since, he yielded, and my quondam friend escaped, to my great satisfaction and de light. The graveyard at Ringgold Barracks was a sad and melancholy spot. Long dismal rows of graves of victims of cholera and massacre, with only a small numbered stick to mark each grave, the name of its occupant alone to be discovered by referring to the record book of the hospital. These graves, in spite of all care and precau tion, could not be protected from the ravages of wild beasts, principally herds of \"cayote\" or small wolves, who, fierce and bloody, and urged by ravenous hunger, continually prowled around the garrison at night. Their dismal howlings sounded like the moaning of the sea waves, and lulled me to sleep every night during our stay in Texas. These forsaken graves were principally those of soldiers from the ranks ; but among them were those of two gallant officers, marked alone by a wooden cross, with the initials of their name and the date of their death. One had"], [175, "A GRAVEYARD. 169 died homeward bound, on his route from Cali fornia ; the other had been drowned in the Rio Grande, seized with a vertigo while bath ing. In one corner of this desolate inclosure was the grave of a little child, only a year old, who had been buried here till the proper time of removal came. Different specimens of the cac tus were planted carefully around it, where it lay by itself apart from the rest. I often walked that way, and felt the deepest sympathy for the mother far away, who had been forced to go and leave her baby in this wretched place.

While at Ringgold Barracks, some Mexican officers from Camargo crossed the river to pay General Harney a visit of state ; they dis mounted and left their horses at the door of the commanding officer's quarters, in charge of their orderlies, who had accompanied them. These latter, tempted by the offered hospitality of the soldiers' mess-room, left their charge for a while. When the distinguished guests came to depart, they found that the silver-mounted pistols, that they had left in the holsters of their"], [179, "\" THE ARMY.\" 173 saddles, had disappeared, much to the chagrin of our officers, whose sense of hospitality and houor were very much annoyed by the trans ition. The next morning the thief was dis covered among the newly arrived dragoons. I 6aw the meeting between him and Gene ral Harney, who stood on the piazza. He 6eized the culprit by the nape of the neck, like a kitten, and administered a good shaking and moral lecture combined, the former probably by far the most effective ! He was (as may be imagined by this fact) a man of tremendous physique, and strong im petuous passions, yet tender-hearted in the ex treme towards children or animals. As I heard a Texan remark, he was \" one of your high flung fellers.\" This same high flung or high toned spirit is the pervading trait of our army. Mean-spirited men are the rare exceptions. The cadet breathes it in with the air of his Alma Mater, and so strong is its influence, that through life it guides his course with straightforward integrity. On another occasion General Whiting, another"], [180, "\" TilE ARMY.\" 174 specimen of our brave officers, visited us on a general tour of inspection throughout Texas. He was a polished gentleman of the old school ; bland, courteous, and possessed of an affability that made him extremely popular. He seemed a man who would meet the most startling emer gency calmly, yet with undaunted courage. The \"stuff\" that forms our army is of the noblest kind. How illiberal are the murmurs at the expenditure that provides such a bulwark of strength to guard our outposts. Little does the casual observer at West Point know of the after existence of its graduates, and their lives of exile and privation on the frontier, passed in lonely seclusion from the world, a stranger to its luxuries, almost a stranger to the ordinary comforts of civilization. In our populous cities, where the refinements of life are easily attained, the officers of the army are seldom met.

The occasion of a great national fair which was annually held at Camargo, an ancient Mexican town on the other side of the river, directly op posite Rio Grande City, afforded an excellent occasion for visiting that place, as these fairs bring together a large number of Mexicans, with the peculiar productions of the different sections of the country. Having been duly provided with passports, embellished with the usual flour ishes of the pen inseparable from all Mexican official documents, we crossed the river, wagon and all, by a rope ferry, in a rather rickety and diminutive old scow.

As these"], [183, "177 CAMARGO. worthies made it a matter of conscience to steal only two thirds of all that they received, they were of course very vigilant ! They looked care lessly at our passports, and we went on our way unmolested. The city lay 'three miles from the shore. The. drive to it was delightful, through a kind of lane, lined on either side with low flowering shrubs and brushwood. Sweet-scented flowers covered the ground, and vines clambered on each bush and scrubby, stunted tree.

They had bright, expressive faces; but their complexions were generally dark and 8*"], [184, "178 CAMARGO. coarse, which destroyed that appearance of re finement so essential to a beauty that can inspire a cultivated taste with admiration. The men rode on mules. Frequently a woman was seat ed on a pillion behind them, carrying a bambino for the priest to christen at Camargo. At length a turn in the road brought us in sight of the town. The round stone tower of the quaint old cathedral, surmounted by a belfry and a massive stone cross, seemed to terminate the road. On the immediate outskirts of the town lies a burial ground, which has been there for centu ries. It is surrounded by a high, ungainly-look ing brick wall, with a singularly colossal mas sive gateway in the Alhambric style. There are traces of great former splendor dis cernible everywhere in Camargo, which was formerly a place of considerable consequence but of late years has been falling into a state of dilapidation.

A quadrangular plaza, faced by dilapidated stone buildings, centuries old, forms a centre from which diverge a series of streets, with pro miscuous houses, some of logs, or adobes, with thatched roofs, and some mere shelters from the sun, that a summer wind might destroy. A few of the houses still bear traces of fresco on their exteriors, and many of elaborate stone carving, while the doore and windows are heavily bar red, like those of Havana, giving a gloomy, prison-like aspect to the city. This precaution is taken that the whole house may be thrown open and yet protected. It gives the inhabitants a very small share of pri vacy, and a stranger walking through the streets gets quite an insight into their inner life.

She was beautiful, and had what the world technically calls \" a favored suitor.\" Who could blame her if after a year's mourning she smiled coquettishly ? Considering the serious drawback of my speak ing very bad Spanish, and she speaking very bad French, our conversation was remarkably animated, continuous, and even philosophical ! I quite agreed with her that the most absurd thing a young and charming widow could do, was to barter a self-created chain of roses for the iron links of Hymen. The two younger sisters, Inanita and Antoi netta, and a staid elderly brother, formed the"], [189, "183 CAMARGO. family. These former were not as decidedly handsome or as decidedly intelligent as Dolores, although rather in her style, but as they were both redolent of \"bread and butter,\" it was hardly fair to judge prematurely of their attrac tions ; that bouquet must have entirely vanished, before the fascinations can fully devekope them selves. When dinner was announced I was handed with no little ceremony, by Don Jesu, into the dining-room, which opened on the gar den in the rear, through a stone archway. Simi lar arches on either side opened, on the one hand, into a long low kitchen, and on the other into the carriage-house, where stood the massive family coach, covered with brass mountings and armorial bearings, but which was seldom used, as their means could not supply the necessary horses and men. Tlie coach, however, remained a relic of the departed glories of their line, and was preserved with almost religious care. It seems impossible to entirely eradicate the old Castilian pride of blood. In all the bet ter class of houses, both here and in Havana, the room for the carriage is in close vicinity to"], [190, "184 CAMARGO. other suites of apartments. In it the family pets generally find a home. This one was full of wicker-work cages of strange and beautiful birds, orioles and mocking-birds, those \" nightin gales of the south.\" Several fearful, unnatural looking, but highly prized ducks, roamed tamely at large, and often found their way in very un comfortably close vicinity to the feet of an un suspecting guest. A tame stork with a very vicious face, tied by the leg, made me fearfully nervous that he might escape from restraint. A beautiful little paroquet, pea-green, with a crimson top-knot and very knowing eyes, kept repeating his own praises continually, in every mood and tone peculiar to that conceited and self appreciating race of birds. A tame fawn exqui sitely small and beautiful, and a glass basin of gold fish, completed this zoological list. The Mexican women are very fond of pets, especially a race of dogs, that are jet black, without any hair. They seem to be made of black india-rubber, and are anything but beautiful, although they are cherished with the greatest fondness by their mistresses, who manufacture a peculiar"], [191, "185 CAMARGO. kind of soft wool cushion, of various shades of bright colors, for them to lie on. The Chihuahua dogs are rare, even here in such close vicinity to Mexico, but they are in great demand, on ac count of their beauty. They are less than a foot long, and six or eight inches high, looking as if they might have been imported by Gulliver, on his return from the kingdom of Lilliput. The dinner was of a most peculiar description, to a person unused to Mexican customs and habits of life. It commenced with a compound of leeks, onions, and red peppers, a kind of soup, of which the smell was sufficient for one course. A pyramid of spun sugar, flanked by two mas sive silver flagons of vin ordinaire, ornamented the centre of the table. The rest of the table equipage was plain and American. The second course was formed of a large dish of beef and mutton stewed together, and small apples and peaches stewed whole with it. These were piled in the centre with an embankment of mashed yellow turnips surrounding it. I was getting dreadfully nervous, for fear the dinner might pass without mv sense of courtesy fore-"], [192, "186 CAMARGO. ing me to taste even a mouthful of die extraor dinary viands of semi-barbaric food. A dish of frijoles at length appeared, and caused a deep sigh of relief on my part. Chickens, with rice, sugar, and pepper, all boiled up together, regard less of small feathers, followed, and then came the dessert, dulcies of candied cactus and melons, made by the Senoritas themselves, wliich were really beautiful, a bright green, cov ered with a coat of crystallized sugar. A peon or slave stood behind each chair, besides several extra ones, whose duty it was to go to the kitchen, where two women on their knees were rolling and baking tortillas as rapidly as they could, which the attendants took hot from the fire, on the palms of their disagreeable looking hands, and bringing them to the table, would literally flap them (vide Johnson) down on the cloths beside every one's plate. These are used in the place of bread ; they are made of ground or crushed corn, and are baked in large flat cakes the size of sea-biscuit, on a peculiar kind of broad, open oven, which article, it is a singular fact, is manufactured for the Mexican market"], [193, "CAMARGO. 187 in the city of New York. The tortillas seem quite tasteless and unpalatable to a person un used to them, but are very generally used by all classes of Mexicans. It is very amusing to watch the women on their knees rolling out the dough on a wooden tray, and then baking them. After dinner and cafe, noir came the cigars and cigaritos. Dolores offered to initiate me into the universal custom in the country of smok ing, with many jokes at my being so au fait for a novice, such an apt scholar, &c, &c. I had heard a great deal of the grace with wliich these donnas handled their cigaritos, but as I had seen a lionne or two during my few brief summers, I thought that, compara tively speaking, they had been very much overrated. Dolores took me to her chambre d coucher, and showed me many of her treasures, books, pictures, and embroideries, all of which displayed refinement of taste and a higher culture than is generally found in a place where there are so few advantages of education to profit by. They"], [194, "188 CAMARGO. had over a dozen peons or slaves, whose prin cipal business seemed to be to lie around idle, without any effort at occupying themselves more than was absolutely necessary. One of them, a girl of about eighteen, had never seen an Ame rican woman before, and got into raptures over even so humble a specimen of them as myself, saying: \" Comobella ! comoblanca!\" (howbeauti ful ! how white !) All the peons crowded around at her exclamations, to look at the \" Senorita blanca\" and finally the girl could restrain her feelings of intense admiration no longer, but after patting and stroking my hands, saying they had never rolled tortillas (a fact which I did not deny), she gave me a sudden and overpowering hug, which entirely took away my breath. Rather a familiar and disgusting evidence of admiration ! Another peon, a withered old crone, almost bent in two with age, sat rocking herself backwards and forwards on a stone bench in the garden. They told me she was insane, and had been so for more than fifty years, having at that far off period been crossed in love by an officer from the city of Mexico, who,"], [195, "CAMARGO, 189 it seems, like the \"false young knight\" of old, \" had loved and then rode away.\" This old and lovelorn damsel had, since her wits had taken leave of her, lived on the public, owning no one place for a home, and yet for over fifty years she had been well clothed, well fed, and sheltered, although there were no insane asylum funds or taxes \u2014 speaking well for the humanity of the inhabitants of Camargo. Except the many booths where ordinary American trifles and merchandise were sold, and an extra crowd of loungers in the streets, we saw no evidence of the great national fair. We found we had arrived literally \" a day too late for the fair.\" It had been held for the past week, and the merchants and visitors were now separating for their different homes. The last of the bull-fights (to my everlasting regret) had taken place the night before. That evening there was to be a ball and fireworks, as a \"wind up\" to this festal season. The fireworks of Mexico are famous for their beauty ; those made by Europeans and Americans cannot be com pared to them. Dolores entreated us to stay at"], [196, "190 CAMARGO. their house all night, but that being impossible, we bade them a cordial, almost an affectionate, adieu, with promises of a speedy reciprocation of my visit on their part. Circumstances which closely followed, induced them to leave Camargo and take up their per manent residence in the city of Mexico, thus effectually preventing our meeting again."], [197, "CHAPTER XVIH. FILIBUSTERING. As Christmas approached, rumors of revolu tion on the Mexican frontier became rife ; bands of filibusters were heard of in the neighbor hood, and political intrigue absorbed all other topics of interest. A scheme had been arranged for some time past between General Canales, the General-in-chief of the Mexican militia, and General Arista, the President of the Republic of Mexico, to declare the northern portions of that country (where the latter owned vast pos sessions) an independent State, which in the course of time they proposed to annex to the United States, and in the meanwhile to demand our support and protection, under the new title of the \" Republic of Sierra Madre.\" The most prominent and active leader in the cause was Caravajal, one of the shrewdest"], [198, "192 FILIBUSTERING. statesmen of Mexico \u2014 a man of astute intellect, and more than ordinary mental culture. The plans of these diplomatic heads were for a bloodless revolution. The troops belonging to the regular army of Mexico had all been with drawn from the frontier, and the militia (paid vassals and confederates in the scheme) placed there, agreeing to silently and indisputably sur render all power to him. Under this new phase of government, taxes and the custom-houses were alike to be abolished, and a free trade to be established with the United States. These plans were confided to many of the Texan lodge of Free-Masons, to which fraternity Caravajal belonged, and as their interests as merchants were a good deal involved in the issue, they joined heartily with the revolu tionists. Caravajal was by education an American, al though most patriotically devoted to the land of his birth. He had acquired \"a* superior classical education at the University of Kentucky, where he had graduated, and consequently was men tally superior to most of his countrymen, the"], [199, "193 FILIBUSTERING. Mexican institutions for the education of youth being of a very inferior description. He was a small man, with a dark complexion and an eagle eye, the beauty of his excessively ugly face \u2014 like a Scotch terrier \u2014 consisting of this very ugliness combined with an ex pression of great intelligence. The first time that I saw him, I was on horseback, riding across the chapparal to the ranche, on a shop ping expedition, to purchase a few of the many luxuries to be found there. When we met Caravajal, I knew him in an instant, by the stylish way in which he wore his black felt sombrero, by the silver-mounted pistols in his belt, and by the pure English accent of his salu tation. The Texans, impatient for the moment to arrive when the custom-houses and taxes were to be done away with, and their goods in consequence pass into Mexico free of duty, were annoyed at the slow and decidedly un-American style in wdiich affairs were being conducted, and there fore determined to infuse a little more \" patrio tism\" (as they called it) into the counsels of the y"], [200, "194 FILIBUSTERING. leaders. Through them a new turn was given to affairs, and what was in the first place to have been effected by diplomacy, was now destined to terminate in a series of sanguinary engagements, with rapine, murder, and destruction in their train. These commenced directly opposite us, in the siege of Camargo by a mixed army of Americans and Mexicans, led on by Caravajal, roused to so high a pitch of enthusiasm, that men from the ranks were daily deserting the garrison of Ringgold Barracks to join them. On the morning of the battle we were awakened at dawn by the roar of cannon and the din of musketry that told of the engagement that was going on, within less than three miles of us. The point of the highest eminence in the garrison was a balcony surrounding the flag staff, which was placed on a high ridge of land ; a flight of winding steps led to it. We hurried there to see what we could of the fight. The cold grey dawn of December was just melting under the warm influence of early day A few stars shone dimly around the faint out line of a new moon, and the crimson and"], [201, "FILIBUSTERING. 195 golden rays of a southern sun glowed and sparkled on the frosty air as it rose slowly in the horizon over the mountains des Lampases. With the exception of one mountain range, the surrounding country was flat, and on every side prairie lands lay stretched as far as the eye could see, till sky and land seemed merged into an indistinct vapor. The Rio Grande wound its sluggish way amidst its barren sandy banks, more like a wide canal than a river. The buildings of Camp Ringgold lay at our feet. A little fur ther up the river was Rio Grande City. Flags were hoisted from the house-tops, and signs of an unusual bustle and excitement prevailed. Almost directly opposite lay Camargo, the scene of the battle. A heavy, dull, vapory cloud hung over the country in that direction, and the firing of guns, wild yells of men ar\u00bbd neighing of horses, in mingled confusion, came wafted to us at intervals on the clear morning breeze, giving token of the struggle that was eoinsr on between the filibuster and Mexic-'.n forces. The Mexican troops, who occupied the tov n,"], [202, "196 FILIBUSTERING. had taken the precaution to leave their barracks the moment they learned of the approach of the filibusters, and formed on the plain, outside of the city walls. They knew by experience with wdiat skill the Americans penetrated through the houses by making holes in the walls, thus passing from house to house, covering themselves from the fire of the enemy, until they were in close rifle distance, when, each man taking a careful aim, a deadly fire would be opened upon them such as few troops (and especially Mexicans) could withstand. It was to avoid all this that they had determined to meet the assailants out side of the town, a man\u0153uvre entirely unex pected by the filibusters. The battle was there fore commenced sooner than they had antici pated. At the first fire, the Mexican allies of the filibusters fled in every direction. All at tempts to rally them were vain. Many in their flight plunged into the river and were drowned. The few Americans were left alone. These gathered together around their only piece of ar tillery, determined to die rather than yield the field."], [203, "197 FILIBUSTERING. The Mexican foe outnumbered them ten to one. This did not daunt them. The leaden storm swept through their ranks, and thinned their numbers. Still they stood their ground. The fugitives brought word to the Americans on our side of the river of the critical position of their friends ; the greatest excitement pre vailed. Every American not in the army, armed himself for the rescue. The regular soldiers would have gone had they dared. Even the women wanted to go. Clay Davis, who had remained aloof until now, mounted his horse and rode out to an encampment of Carese Indians. Soon he reappeared with his face painted red, followed by the whole band of Indians, yelling at the top of their lungs, bran dishing their tomahawks and spears. Gathering hastily into boats, they were drawn swiftly across the river, and darting up the banks they disappeared in the chapparal to wards the scene of action. In the meanwhile the firing had ceased. It was a moment of fearful suspense, for we thought the little band had been forced to sur-"], [204, "198 FILIBUSTERING. render, but loud cheers soon told us that the Indians had arrived, and the firing was again renewed with redoubled spirit, and \" All day long the noise of battle Rolled among the mountains.\" Happily, night came and put a stop to the un equal strife. The silence which followed the suspension of hostilities was broken in upon at sunset by the vesper chimes, which floating once more from the old cathedral towers, on the evening air, told a story of peace, contrasting strongly with the recent conflict. The bells tolled forth a solemn requiem, that fell soothingly on the ear of the dying, and over the dead that had fallen. The atmosphere was cleared from the smoke of bat tle, and the domes and towers of Camargo rose up clearly against the twilight sky, the fiery crimson of a peculiar sunset casting a red glow on nature. In other centuries and other climes, this sign would have been looked upon as a symbol from Mars, smiling on heroic deeds, on receiving to his realms the warriors that had"], [205, "FILIBUSTERING. 199 been slain. No one thought of this, and I even heard one of our party (a Major over forty) re mark that the sunset promised a hot day in store for us ! The world gets every day more painfully matter of fact, and the imagination becomes cramped aud subdued by utilitarianism ! Poets, it is well known, are yearly becoming rarer, and even a poetic temperament now yearns for a court office and salary to inspire its muse ! The most daring deed, and the most glowing lyre, may linger for the moment on our ears and then pass into entire forgetfulness \u2014 a mere rip ple on the smooth sea of our common-place ex istence. Where, now, grow the laurel and the bay tree to furnish crowns for the poet or the hero ? The next morning developed a most peculiai and unparalleled circumstance in the annals of war. On the previous day the filibusters came to the conclusion that as their forces were dimi nishing, and their ammunition giving out, they would prove the maxim that \" the better part of valor is discretion,\" and retire to replenish their forces and fire-arms, to renew the attack with"], [206, "200 FILIBUSTERING. more assured prospects of success. Simultane ously with the filibusters' fit of discretion, a pa nic struck the Mexican troops (who are innate cowards), and as one party beat a retreat in one direction, the other party fled in an opposite one, leaving the late scene of contest in sole possession of the priests, the women and chil dren, the infirm and the dying. These began making immediate preparations to cross (with their possessions) to the American side of the river, where they knew their lives and proper ties would be more secure. Our horses were ready at the door, and we rode up to Rio Grande City to hear the particu lars of yesterday's engagement. Tlie scene that met us there was unexpectedly full of novelty and raciness. The river seemed alive with groups of refugees, in row boats and flat boats, crossing the river, fleeing from the revolutionary ravages. Children of every age, peasant women with bright petticoats and rebosas, aged crones with whitened locks and bent forms, tottering old men with long silvered beards, patriarchs, cripples, and bambinos, all that was pi.;f..l and"], [207, "FILIBUSTERING. 201 helpless in human nature, seemed to be wafted across, and landed on the shores, as if there were safety and protection in the very sand banks on which they landed, because they bore the (to them) sacred name of one of the United States, the home of \" the proud Americans \" as they ad miringly call us. Nowhere are we more respected, even vene rated, as a nation than by these simple and ignorant peasantry of our border. All the vital ity that they know is due to our influence, which comes to their stagnant land as refreshingly as rain to a drooping parterre, and causes civiliz ation to flow through these regions, like its river Rio Bravo del Norte, bringing with it the only blessing this barren country has ever known. The American elements that have spread here have given a new impulse, where but a short time ago all was torpid and lifeless. On the plaza were gathered clusters of filibusters, among them many who have since become doubly notorious for their daring and bravery under General Walker, at Nicaragua. Rumors of Caravajal's near neighborhood were whispered 9*"], [208, "202 FILIBUSTERING. about, and I recognised in a little dark-eyed, curly-headed boy, a likeness to the famous border chieftain, which led me to suppose his family were there also incog. Most conspicuously among these men stood Clay Davis, in a red shirt, bound with black ribbon, falling carelessly open at the neck, showing linen of the exquisite embroidery of the Mexican women, a sash and belt filled with fire-arms, a Kentucky \" tooth-pick \" glistening in its crimson sheath among them. A slouched black hat completed his graceful costume, which, with the exception of a little extra touch of dandyism, closely resembled that of all the fili busters. I never could quite bring myself to the belief indulged in by many worthy people, that it is a sign of a weak mind to eschew clumsy boots and wear spotless linen ! Around Mr. Davis were gathered the Indians whom he had led so gallantly to the rescue. They belonged to a tribe once brave and fa mous, now dwindled down to about two hundred warriors ; they were on excellent terms with the Mexicans and Americans, from whom they had"], [209, "FILIBUSTERING. 203 learned, by occasional intercourse, some of the rudiments of civilization. Hearing of the war fare that was in prospect, they had come down from their northern retreats to offer their ser vices in the cause of the revolutionists, of course expecting some remuneration in the way of plunder, or otherwise, as I do not think well enough of human nature to imagine that disin terested good fellowship alone could inspire a band of two hundred men simultaneously ! They were dressed in the skins of wild animals, bound around their loins, their hair parted in the cen tre of the head, and braided down their backs in the style of the Misses Ken wigs. They were armed with bows and arrows, and rifles (sup plied of course by the Americans), of which they had learned the use with great aptness. Every man had an arrow peculiar to himself, so that after the fight was over each one might ascer tain with certainty who could claim the scalps of the slain. Several squaws accompanied them, dressed in wolf-skins, with bead work belts and moccasins. Their countenances were unattrac tive and inexpressive ; evidently they were not"], [210, "204 FILIBUSTERING. troubled by any useless sensibility ; they looked more like men than women. They had with them several little copper-colored papooses strapped down most unmercifully to a shingle, on whom they seemed to scorn to lavish those little foolish endearments so natural and spon taneous to the maternal heart. They rather treated them like little faggots that some stern necessity forced them not to entirely abandon. A tiger cat with its cub that I once saw might have put their stolidity to shame ! The main portion of these lovely females were encamped with their children some few miles distant \u2014 it was only a chosen few who had been brought down to the ranche. While we stood looking on at this motley group, and conversing with the filibuster officers, a new boat arrived from the opposite shore, and disgorged its promiscuous crew of peasantry and soldiers : among them a man landed, and came to report himself to an officer who was talking to me, so that I had the full benefit of his words. His name was Sam Stevens, evidently a private, and a person of some consequence with his con"], [211, "205 FILIBUSTERING. federates, who gathered around and hailed his advent, among them with a loud shout of wel come, one of them exclaiming, \" Here's a fel ler that's real weather-proof, he was shot in the eye by a cannon ball, and it couldn't hurt him !\" To this, Sam modestly remarked, with a broad deprecating grin, \"Well, it was some thing of a jar!\" which speech was received with a perfect howl of delight by his apprecia tive audience. Thus encouraged (first touching his hat gallantly towards me), he gave us a spirited account of yesterday's enagement, tell ing how Major D. had \"spit fire on them greas ers \" with his rifle, and led on the forlorn hope, with a tremendous amount of \"pluck.\" From this his discourse flowed off into a wild rhap sody on \" the great cause,\" making abundant use of the words sovereign people, freedom, liberty, and other expressions peculiarly Ameri can in style, all of which was received by his audience with rounds of hearty applause. I could have remained for hours, listening and observing, with intense interest, the proceedings of these varied characters, but being with \"the"], [212, "206 FILIBUSTERING. officer of the day,\" who had to return at the 6troke of the hour to make a tour of inspection of the garrison, we turned our horses' heads reluctantly homewards. On the following evening, as we were taking our accustomed ride towards Rio Grande City, we met a group of Mexicans and Texans bear ing the corpse of a man across the chapparal towards the garrison burying-ground. He had fallen in the engagement, yesterday, mortally wounded, and had died that morning on the American side of the river. We paused as they passed, and one of them handed us some papers that had been found on the body, which was wrapped in a Mexican poncho, and laid on a rough bier. He was young, in the first flush of manhood; his finely-cut features showed refine ment as well as beauty. I knew instinctively that there were those living whose blood would have been checked in its course, could they have seen him as \" In the twilight cold and grey, Lifeless and beautiful he lay,\""], [213, "207 FILIBUSTERING. no hand of affection to smoothe the tangled masses of his hair, or to show those last tributes that love alone can offer to the dead. I kept the papers that these men gave me, and feel no scruples in giving the inferences that I drew from them, as I never found a clue to his history or even his name. They con sisted of some notes of filibuster life, and his letters, one evidently from his mother, written in a delicate tremulous hand, although the sig nature and superscription had been carefully destroyed. It begged her \"dearest boy\" to come home, as she could not live long without him. The other was from his lady-love, and to the same effect. I felt much more sympathy, however, for the former than for the latter, for as a general rule bereaved lady-loves are consolable \u2014 but no new affection can efface the image of a lost child from its mother's heart ; no time entirely dry up her secret tears. There can never cease to be moments when through the vista of years her grief will seem as if ot yesterday. The United States Court was to sit in Browns-"], [214, "208 FILIBUSTERING. ville in a few days, to try all of these men that could be captured for a breach of the neutrality laws. The people there, as well as the press, took the warmest interest and felt the deepest sympathy in the success of the revolutionists, wdiile the Court and the United States officers (whatever their private feelings may be) were in duty bound to frown on their proceedings. Rumors that the Texas Rangers, lately disband ed from the United States service, were on their way to Rio Grande City, were very prevalent. Their object was, to get on the wilds of the prairies further north, beyond the influence of the law, and do all in their power to aid the filibuster forces in what they regarded as a righteous cause. Our government ordered that officers should be stationed with a certain number of men and pieces of artillery all along the river to prevent American citizens from crossing to the Mexican side, and joining what it denominated the rebel forces. This however was a very difficult, almost an imprac ticable thing on so extensive a line ; the most they could achieve was to prevent large armed"], [215, "209 FILIBUSTERING. bodies from crossing. Smaller parties could not be stopped, and it was very easy for these to rendezvous and organize on the other side. Parties of troops were sent out from Ringgold Barracks to disperse any armed bodies that they might encounter, and in this way allay the excitement on our side of the river at least. One of these parties encountered General Canales, the greatest guerilla chieftain of Mexico during the late war with the United States. These guerillas correspond to the \" minute men\" of the revolutionary war, who pursued their everyday vocations, unless the enemy came in their immediate vicinity, when, at a moment's warning, they took up arms and assembled for battle. Canales had been probably the most deadly enemy our army had among the hosts of their Mexican opponents. Since Caravajal had broken faith with Arista and Canales, by telling their schemes to the Texan free-masons, they had ceased to act in concert, and when, from the Mexican shore, the latter saw a body of regular United States troops with two officers, encamped on the river's"], [216, "210 FILIBUSTERING. bank, he knew intuitively their errand, and raised signal flags to attract their attention. This accomplished, an American soldier was immediately despatched in a \" dug-out,\" bor rowed from a Mexican whose ranche lay close by, and it soon relanded with this bloody chief, who with extended arms warmly embraced the American officers, many of whose friends had fallen killed or wounded by his hand. After this affectionate yet unpleasant embrace they drank a pledge of good fellowship, Canales drinking out of a silver flagon, which I still pre serve, and which at that time formed part of the camp equipage of one of the officers of the party. He was a corpulent, greasy, and benevolent looking gentleman, saying more overwhelmingly civil things in the space of five minutes than he had ever felt in the whole course of his life, with more grace of manner than it would be supposed 60 stout and elderly a person could muster. The Mexicans are full of a kind of stately Sir Charles Grandison grandeur and dignity, which might be imposing to a person possessed of an impressible mind, but under other circum-"], [217, "211 FILIBUSTERING. stances it appears forced, tiresome, and even absurd. Knowing some of the outlaws quite inti mately, I accepted an offer from one of them to send a message to the party who were in search of filibusters. Cavarajal's courier came and received my commissions and after riding express to deliver it, rode on to inform him of the whereabouts of the party of regulars who were on his track ! My dreadful infringement of etiquette was however gallantly winked at, and afforded a great topic of amusement to all parties. Rigidly observed orders would have produced a civil war, instead of attaining the d.esired object of suppressing revolution, and there was no little good feeling existing in many instances between the parties of the pursuer and the pursued."], [218, "CHAPTER XIX. LOS INDIOS. In a wild, picturesque spot near the banks of the river, some miles above the garrison, the Carese Indians had pitched their camp. Here they had left their squaws and papooses, when they join ed the filibusters in their attack on Camargo. A company of mounted infantry was going that way, where it was reported there was some grass growing. They were going out in search of it, to give their horses the unwonted luxury of a few hours' grazing. We took advantage of this escort to pay a visit to the Indian en campment. We started very early, while still \u2014 \"The maiden glory of the morning star Shone in the steadfast blue.\" Before the sun had begun to dry up the night's"], [219, "213 LOS IMiIOS. dews, our horses were at the door. It was a delicious southern winter's day \u2014 \" A dewy morn, With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom, Laughing the clouds away, with playful scorn, And living as if earth contained no tomb, And glowing into day.\" A body of armed men rode in advance of us, and the rest followed in our rear. So we rode across the unbeaten prairies, with nothing but occasional sandy ridges to obstruct our path. Vast level plains lay on every side of us, with their scanty covering of weeds and wild flowers, the clear, bright blue sky overhead, cloudless except a few white vapory masses, while the soft perfumed air of a tropical December stole over the senses like the faint odor of violets. The clashing of the sabres, and the steady, monotonous tramp of two hundred horses, did not destroy the influence of the scene. Our escort moved at a gentle pace, a trot or canter being impracticable for any distance, as we were pioneering our own road, and a strong"], [220, "214 LOS INDIOS. chance of unknown impediments lay before us. A walk, too, seemed more in harmony with the atmosphere and its influence. Tlie Indian encampment, with its \" cone-like cabins,\" at length came in view, and we drew up our horses before it. A young chieftain, about ten years old, came out to look at us. He had a bright copper-colored complexion, and long, straight, black hair. In his hand he held a bow and arrow, quite in the style of \" one little Indian boy !\" \" Picayune ! picayune !\" he showed his know ledge of the English by calling out \u2014 the only word he knew, and he made very free use of it. After receiving one of these coins as an en couragement to pursue his studies as a linguist, he disappeared ; but soon returned, with his sis ter, a young squaw, the difference of whose ap pearance from the other women of the tribe was very striking. She was the most beautiful spe cimen of humanity that I ever saw, dressed in a wolf-skin blouse, embroidered with beads, her long hair, plaited in a hundred braids, falling around her in ebon masses. Her face wras cut"], [221, "LOS INDIOS. 215 as if with the chisel of a Phidias, the nostril, mouth, and chin a study of beauty \u2014 \" beautiful disdain\" (of wliich she probably was incapable !) expressed in every delicate curve. Her large, liquid, dreamy eyes, with their heavy lashes, which seemed to require an effort to raise them from her cheek, through which shone a faint red flush that bespoke the Anglo-Saxon blood which rendered her Indian beauty so peerless.

She went into a tent and soon returned, bringing us an offering of milk and watermelons. A number of young Indians of all sizes and ages, quite \"al fres co,\" surrounded us, begging for picayunes, which urgent demands soon caused the sup ply to fail, and the bank to suspend pay ment. We did not dismount, as we found the report of grass to be without foundation. The sun may have scorched it up, or it may have been cut for their cattle by the Indians.

The cabins looked dirty inside, and the squaws and children ditto. They could not speak to us, and seemed more frightened than pleased, so that our visit was not as gratifying as 1 had antici pated. Our ride home I felt to be very perilous. My fears pictured a lurking Camanche in the shadow of each bush ; we however reached home in ignoble safety. Reports of lurking Indians were so rife that my want of valor may be pardoned. Some little time after this visit, one of the warriors of the Carese tribe came down to Ring gold Barracks partially on a tour of inspection, and partially, I suppose, to return the courtesies of our call. One of the sentinels on duty for bade his entrance, on the plea that he had not on a square inch of garment!

Tlie commanding officer considered it his duty to send off all the officers and most of the men to try and terrify this dar ing foe.

Garrison life, in the phase that I saw it, was very pleasant. Each hour was marked by some peculiar military signal. At daybreak \" reveille \" sounded musically on the drowsy ear ; then came the \" sick call,\" especially agreeable to \" Old Soldiers /\" Then the dulcet airs of \" peas upon a trencher,\" or \"roast beef,\" summoned the soldier with fife and drum, to his frugal repast of \"junk\" and hard bread. Guard mounting, morning and evening drill, parade, and finally tattoo, systematically divided the day, without rendering it monotonous. Each officer took his turn in superintending the details of garrison duties. \" The officer of the day \" visited each sentinel, at daybreak, at sunset, and again at midnight, besides a noon day tour of mo-e minute inspection."], [228, "222 CAMP LIFE. The strict discipline and subordination in which the men in the ranks are kept by their officers is truly wonderful to a civilian, used to dealing with that independent race' of subalterns who are legally entitled to \" give warning,\" if displeased by any trifling restriction ! The courts-martial, which meet every month, are very severe in the punishment of disrespect, drunkenness, or any other of the amiable weak nesses to which the rank and file are prone. One delinquent was sentenced to wear a \" bar rel jacket\" every day for a week. It consisted of an old flour barrel with a hole cut for his head to pass through, and a pair of holes for his arms. This was a reward for a chronic tendency to \"spree,\" which somewhat interfered with the strict performance of his military duties. The men were drilling constantly under the supervision of the Sergeants ; the officers drilled them only once a day. Cavalry drill was my especial delight. The officer and his jet black blood horse seemed one object, so perfectly did the motions of the horse and rider move in uni son, either heading a frantic charge, or with his"], [229, "CAMP LIFE. 223 platoon prancing gracefully forward, and then with an unexpected man\u0153uvre turning swiftly on the imaginary foe. The soldiers of our garrison belonged to that horse marine class \" mounted infantry,\" so that drilling them into dragoons was by no means an easy or pleasant task. Without a knowledge of even the first principles of riding, they sat on their horses like a parcel of clothes-pins, and it was not an unusual thing to see a dozen dis mounted at once, and lie sprawling on the ground ; they were instantly up, however, and in their saddles to try it once more. In spite of their mishaps, they seemed to enjoy it very much, and after a few months' perseverance became quite a presentable cavalry company. \" Swearing like a trooper\" is a very graphic expression, for if the most sanctified divine, knowing the beauties of a well performed cavalry man\u0153uvre, were called upon to perform the task of drilling raw men to the duty, he would have committed this tin gentlemanly sin almost spontaneously. This course of mounting the foot regiments"], [230, "224 CAMP LIFE. was adopted to increase our resources in sending out scouting parties after the Indians, who at certain seasons were very troublesome and dangerous. These scouting parties, when equipped to start on their perilous but exciting adventures, presented a very spirited picture. The officer was generally dressed in a dragoon fatigue jacket, with gold shoulder straps and buttons, a broad brimmed slouched sombrero, and a pair of boots with sheaths of leather to the waist, to protect him from the underbrush through which he was forced to ride a great part of the way. A belt full of pistols, a sword buckled to the side, and a six-shooting rifle, composed his supply of firearms. A pow der-flask hanging from the belt, and a canteen of water, with saddle-bags of limited size and capacity, held all the stores that he could take with him for a week. The shirts worn on these occasions would pro duce a nervous shock on the sensitive nerves of a certain class of petits maitres, whose ideas are confined to the fine linen and delicate cambric of a chemisiere a la mode. They are composed"], [231, "CAMP LIFE. 225 of a dark blue check material, warranted to last a week, and are in great demand where laun dresses are scarce. They are termed \" Old Hickories,\" cost exactly fifteen cents, and are generally used by hunting and scouting parties in this part of the world. The men were equipped something like their officers, and a few loaded mules with a limited store of provisions accompanied the party. The deer and other game which they might shoot on the way were cooked on a stick before the camp fire when they halted for the night to prepare their primitive meals and take a few hours' necessary rest. Sometimes they rode by moon light, and chose the heat of the day for rest and sleep. The first thought of the men on halting is for their officer, whose simple arrange ments for repose are soon made ; his saddle furnishes a pillow, his overcoat and blanket a bed. Too frequently a fatal termination gives a painful and never-forgotten interest to this peculiar kind of military duty, as was the case with a scouting party that went out from Laredo 10*"], [232, "226 CAMP LIFE.

They started out with the usual equip ments, and on the second day after folio wirg an Indian trail, came to a point where it suddenly disappeared, and no traces of it could be disco vered. The guide, with all his practised keenness, was at a loss which direction to take, and it was finally decided that they should separate and go in different directions. They drew lots for the guide, who remained with Lieutenant V., wdiile Lieutenant H. took an opposite direction. They bade each other a gay and friendly farewell, with expectations of meeting again in another week at the garrison at Laredo, each boasting of the scalps and trophies they would show on their return. Harry Love, the guide, who remained with the former party, was a character whom it is worth a slight digression to describe. He was originally from Vermont, and by his frankness"], [233, "227 CAMP LIFE. and fearlessness in a measure redeemed his native State in my somewhat prejudiced eyes. His physique was that of a real \" Green Moun tain Boy,\" six feet three, and stalwart and robust in proportion, as bold and intrepid as a lion, with a voice of thunder, and a mild blue eye, which softened the otherwise fierce aspect of his rough, sun-burnt face, which was half con cealed by a flowing beard and heavy moustache. When a mere boy, he became disgusted with the restraints of home, especially the petty ty ranny of a step-mother, and by a midnight flight sundered for ever these galling domestic ties. At a seaboard town, he sought and obtained a situation as cabin-boy on a vessel bound for the West Indies. When fairly out at sea, he discovered that he formed part of a bucanier crew, whose exploits on the Spanish Main he would only allude to vaguely in after years. Over all attempts to trace his career through the vicissitudes incident upon this piratical life he studiously threw the veil of taciturnity. At the opening of the war with Mexico, he found himself occupying the uninteresting yet"], [234, "228 CAMP LIFE. lucrative position of a stevedore at Mobile in Alabama. The news of the critical position of General Taylor, at Fort Brown, which alarmed for a mo ment the whole country, created along the southern seaboard the wildest excitement. Vo lunteers were not wanting, and prominent among them was Harry Love. The morning after the receipt of the news, he with a hundred others set sail for the Rio Grande, to the rescue of their brave countrymen. But the old hero had fought his way through Mexican bayonets before they arrived, and Harry returned to Mo bile, to fulfil a long cherished wish of his heart. As has been before remarked, \"alas for human constancy!\" he found that the fair object of his love had proved false during his absence, and bestowed herself on a less patriotic admirer ! Harry, in a fit of misanthropic disgust, return ed to the army, and throughout the war perform ed the most reckless feats of bravery. He never became entirely cured of his disappointment, which seemed to have taken a hold on his heart that neither time nor the instigations of common"], [235, "CAMP LIFE. 229 sense could entirely eradicate. Many a bright moonlight night, on a scout, he would lie on the grass, and discuss the charms of this delusive syren. It might have seemed weakness had he not been such a brave, manly fellow, with a mind full of native talent, deeply imbued with a noble sense of honor, learned from no other code but the instincts of his own uneducated and gene rous nature. Harry became quite an adept in Indian scout ing while in Texas, and frequently accompaniad parties of government troops. On these expedi tions he seemed to know the trail almost intui tively. A crushed blade of grass, or some other slight signal, led him on their track for miles, until some unmistakable token of their recent presence proved that his conjectures had not been without good foundations. On the occa sion of the scout to which I now allude, the trail had been lost for several days, and it seemed almost impossible to find any trace of it. The men had shown symptoms of insubordination for some weeks before starting from camp, and"], [236, "230 CAMP LIFE. a few hours after the officers had divided forces, it was discovered that they were commencing to exhibit signs of intoxication. Their canteens were examined, and found to contain whiskey instead of water, which had been surreptitiously introduced after inspection previous to starting. Summary measures had to be immediately taken. There was no time to pause in the midst of a lonely prairie, with the Camanche foe lurk ing near, and only a band of half intoxicated men to oppose them. They did not dare to dis obey the order to empty their canteens, although no promptness was shown, and it was done with muttered curses and murmurs of disapproval. One man, more bold and intoxicated than the rest, refused, and showed such flagrant symptoms of disrespect and disobedience, that very prompt measures were called for. So he was seized by order of the officer by his sullen and unwilling companions and tied with a rope to his horse, who dragged him so for nearly a mile. This sobered the rest almost instantly, and they rode forward, knowing they had no alternative but strict observance of their duties. The rope"], [237, "231 CAMP LIFE finally broke, and the man was soon lost to the view of his companions. He eventually reco vered from the effect of his whiskey and bruises, and found his way back on foot, telling some of his messmates, with great gusto, what a sight it was to see his lieutenant, when he got his pluck up ! This event, instead of producing dislike on the soldiers' part, seemed to add to their respect. The uneducated mind unconsciously and innately yields to mental sway, where deci sion and firmness combine to force their will, and \" private Jackson \" after this was always a model specimen of military discipline. No other course but sacrificing the chances of life in one of them could have been pursued under the cir cumstances. There was no alternative for the preservation of the rest ; prompt and decided measures were absolutely requisite. The morning after these occurrences, the party came in sight of the encampment of the Indians, at a distance of several miles. With a wild shout, the men put spurs to their horses, and dashed over the prairie, with the speed of the wind. As they neared the camp their excite-"], [238, "232 CAMP LIFE. ment increased, for the Indians, so suddenly sur prised, abandoning their wigwams, horses, and everything, scattered in all directions, seek ing safety in the densely tangled chapparal. The soldiers followed them into the thicket, tearing their flesh and their garments at every step ; horses and riders were pierced and bleeding from the thorns, which the Indians saved them selves from by crawling on the ground like snakes. It was impossible to trace or follow them, as the horses, maddened with pain, refused to further breast the thorns. Some trophies were secured from the camp, consisting of robes, head-dresses, ponchos, &c, and the pursuit con tinued by skirting the chapparal. On the following day the guide struck the trail of the retreating Indians, and, as it was very fresh, the party had strong hopes of soon overtak ing them on the open prairie, where they could make up for the disappointment of the day before.

But what a sight met their view ! Tlie ground was strewn with dying men, and Lieutenant H., pierced with five arrows, was lying under the shelter of a low bush, in the last agonies of death. The story was soon told. The Indians who had left their encampment pursued by the U. S. soldiers, had met with a mounted party of their tribe whom they had joined, and thinking only of the party in pursuit had neglected the usual precautions, and came suddenly upon the party of Lieutenant H. Tlie fight was brief but desperate. In the midst of it, Lieutenant H. pointed his revol ver at one of them, who immediately com menced to cry and shed tears copiously, thus betraying her to be a squaw, which from her dress and weather-beaten old face he would never have imagined.

The early missions of the Spaniards, to which allusion has already been made, and which were the first attempts to settle the State, were effec tually suppressed by the failure of the crops and the incursions of the savages. In the year 1714, the Spanish government becoming alarmed on hearing of the arrival in Mexico of an adventu rous Canadian, who had crossed through Texas for the purpose of opening commercial relations with that country, and fearing that this portion of their possessions would fall into the hands of the French, decided that the only course to pre vent it would be to renew their missions. They therefore established a chain of posts from Florida to New Mexico, which soon acquired a permanent footing. The ruins of some of these still exist, the crumbling towers, arched roofs and dilapidated walls, indicating a not unpretend ing style of architecture. Some of these ruins are used for government stables, others are un occupied save by the owl and the bat. The establishment of these missions seemed"], [243, "TEXAS PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE. 237 securely to fix civilization in Texas. The Spanish government was extended and ac knowledged throughout the settlements, soldiers were stationed at the missions, and the work of converting and civilizing the Indians proceeded unchecked for a long period of time. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, the Anglo-Saxon pioneers began to find their way to these little colonies. They were soon followed by others, and in 1812 their num bers having been largely augmented by the remnant of the notorious expedition organized by Aaron Burr, a short-lived and unsuccessful revolution was formed against the arbitrary government of Spain. Shortly after this, Mexi co revolted against the authority of Spain, and after a short struggle established her in dependence. From that time to the present, the history of that country has been one con tinued series of revolutions and counter-revo lutions; every page of her annals disfigured with the blood of men who had at one time or other possessed the full confidence of the people."], [244, "238 TEXAS- -PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE. It was not in the nature of things that Texas, in which the Anglo-Saxon blood now predomi nated, should submit to the arbitrary laws and exactions of this fickle and miserable race. The dissolution of their connexion was the natural consequence of tyranny on the one side and manly resistance on the other. The struggle for independence was a severe one, and it was not until the best blood of the pioneers was shed that she proved her capacity for resistance. The names of \"Davie Crock ett\" and \" Bowie,\" whose chivalrous deeds and desperate daring have even now the semblance of fabled story, are engraved on the stones of the Alamo, which will always be regarded by the Texan as a new Thermopyl\u00e6. On the 3d of March, 1837, the independence of Texas as a nation was acknowledged by the United States, and two years after by France and England. But the maintenance of a separate existence among nations required greater exertions than the infant colonists possessed.

It was their birth place, the homes of their brothers, and contained the graves of their fathers. An irresistible impulse led them to seek admission into the Union. This was accomplished in the year 1844. Hazardous as was the experiment to us, the sequel has proved that this political exotic, transplanted from the enervating and sickly soil of Mexico, has, under the genial influence of our institutions, grown into a vigorous and hardy plant. Texas is a State of enormous area, being six hundred miles from east to west, and four hun dred from north to south, containing nearly two hundred and fifty thousand square miles, as large as the New England and Middle States com bined. It contains a population of three hun dred thousand inhabitants exclusive of Indians.

The main object of emigration of course is agriculture. The most remarkable physical fea ture of the State is the extraordinary number and extent of the rivers, having a total length exceed ing ten thousand miles, which with their thousand tributaries penetrate to almost every part, causing the soil under the hand of the husbandman to yield abundant harvests. The wild luxuriant growth of the forest trees, along these river banks, have by their overhanging branches, and by falling into the bed of the stream, forming natural rafts, prevented extensive navigation. The valleys of these rivers wdll in a short time yield the great bulk of the cotton and sugar of this country. Considering her comparative infancy, Texas stands among the slave-holding states unrivalled in cultivation and production, in energy and en terprise, in intelligence and morality.

I left Ringgold Barracks with as much pain as pleasure, feeling that had my lot been cast there, it had not been an utterly cheerless one. The climate was delicious, the life neither tame nor monotonous. I left behind me warm hearts, and brought with me sweet memories, and new and enlarged views of life as it really is, robbed of conventionalities.

She used to relate anecdotes of \" her dear old first,\" whom she represented as \" a nice old gentleman,\" a little touchy to be sure ; but that was natural at his age. She loved to dwell on the happiness she had enjoyed when daily combing his scanty grey locks from the rear, she tied them on the top of his shiny and vene- 11*"], [256, "250 THE LAST TAP OF THE DRUM. rable head with a black ribbon ; and she would feelingly dilate on the agony of mind she endur ed when performing this task of love for the last time on his inanimate clay. A month afterwards she married her \"dear Joshua,\" a tall, slim, cadaverous-looking person, with whom she said she was enjoying her \" honeymoon number two.\" This vulgar insti tution of honeymoons was intended for this class of people, I am sure ! Joshua (she said) was not as touchy as \" dear old number one\" on most subjects; but he adored her, and was jealous \u2014 unhappy female ! She was fat and fair as well as forty, and wore an inexhaustible amount of jet finery (tokens of her recent loss of dear old number one). Paul Clifford had a professional eye for scenic effect, and led on by encouraging glances from this bereaved bride, he gazed at her thea trically for hours to the great agony of Joshua, who made his jealousy very evident, and vented it in private on the partner of his bosom.

Frogs were his ideal of rich ness and elegance, and Count d'Orsay never felt more satisfied with the success of his toilet, than did this simple-minded man, when he issued from his state-room with a coat literally embossed with frogs and braiding. He said he had been married in it, and that it was called \" an Italian boulevard,\" after a place in France ! The widow used to wear emeralds in her hair to dinner, and between them they kept up such a degree of elegance and good taste, that it al most supplied these deficiencies in the remaining brown linen passengers. Some months after this I met Joshua in Broadway, and, yielding to an irresistible impulse, stopped to ask him after his wife. With a look in which he strove to embody as much lachrymose distress of mind as possible, he said \"I am sorry, ma'am, to say that Mrs. Joshua is dead!\" \"All that's bright must fade,\" etc. etc !

The philanthropist was quite nonplussed, but afterwards remarked it was fearful to see human souls so blind to their own wretchedness as to be able to dance and sing in a state of such deplorable bondage ! Some Calif orni ans returning to their northern homes, and other less conspicuous passengers, completed our party. On the deck below there a different class of people, and the scene there was at all times animated. A large party of flat-boat men, who had been to New Orleans with their lumber, were returning with us up the river, earning their passage by assisting in taking in fire-wood and freight at the different landings. Some were Mississippi River men, and"], [259, "THE LAiT TAP OF THE DRUM. 253 others from the Ohio and Wabash, a great deal of party spirit was occasionally exhibited among them. One evening at quite a late hour we stopped to take wood at a rough wharf near one of the clear ings. The doors of the furnaces were opened, wliich threw a deep red glow on the shore ; pine faggots were lighted on the bank, and the deck hands and deck passengers were formed into gangs to carry the wood on board. The Wabash River men commenced singing an exulting air with each verse ending \"the gallant Wabash boys.\" This was emphatically groaned at by the others. At the end of it, one of the oppo sition set up the well-known air of \"sailing down the river of the Ohio;\" at this the Mis sissippi River men renewed their dismal groans, and finally followed a terrific row, which it is im possible for me to describe. The whole scene was one peculiar to this river. The fiery glow cast from the furnaces on the shore lighted up these wild looking figures, as they worked at their task, and shouted their excited strains.

Where \"The growths of jasmine turned Their humid arms, festooning tree to tree, And at the root, through lush green grasses, burned The red anemone.\" The evening star shone out in its pale dim beauty, while over all the shades of night were falling. At Natchez \" under the hill\" we took on board a most suspicious-looking set, soon dis covered to be a gang of blacklegs of the deepest dye, who finding they were regarded with suspi cion left the boat at the next landing above. At all times of day and night we would be startled by a hard bump, and the general cry of \"a snag\" would resound. These fallen trees are shifted by each tide, and it is impossible to steer clear of them. Their great roots lie embed ded in the bed of the river, and their trunks pointing directly down the stream have too often caused the most disastrous wrecks and loss of life.

The flat-boat men, on their way down the river, used to amuse me very much. They were a jolly set of reckless fellows, who seemed tc think that after their boat is built, launched, and loaded, they have nothing to do but to en joy to the utmost extent the trip to New Orleans. A fiddle and a banjo generally ac company them, and these combined with their vocal choruses principally of negro minstrelsy, floated over the waters in delightful harmony. They cook their food on deck, and form quite a picturesque group as they sit around the boiling pot from which each helps himself. When they arrive at their destination the flat boat is knocked to pieces, the planks which compose it sold with the cargo, and the crew work their way homeward, on some of the steamers.

Price $1 25. From Morris <& Willie's Home Journal. \" There will undoubtedly be a great desire felt to see this volume \u2014 Giu r razzi is probably the most distinguished of living (Italian) authors, and we are glad to know that the modern literature of Italy \u2014 with which we are but little acquainted \u2014 will be inaugurated by so brilliant a specimen of novel writing as this is. The life of Beatrice has been generally, indeed we may say entirely, misunderstood; but Guerrazzi has shown us in his very powerful work, completed after careful labor, what is probably the correct exposition of this sad history. Every one has read Shelley's tra gedy of the 'Cenci,' and those fortunate enough to have extended their travels os far as Italy, remember as one of the loveliest specimens of art, the ever admired and copied portrait of Beatrice by Guido, now in the gallery of the Barberini Falace. ' Guerrazzi in his Preface to this work says, addressing the unfurtunate shade of Beatrice: \"Inasmuch as I have been able to comprehend thee, implore for me sufficient power to narrate worthily thy history to these dear Italian maidens, who love thee as a sister just departed, though the shadow of two centuries and a half is spread over thy sepulchre. Verily thine is a history of sad crimes; but the maidens of my country will read it. When tho youth whom they love is approaching, they will hasten, blushing, to hide it; but they will read it, and will offer thee the only gift that can be given to the betrayed \u2014 tears.\" The effect of this powerful work upon the impassiouate and vehement Italian reader is such, that certain of the governments have interdicted its publication, and it is now rarely seen in Italy. {3F~ A mutilated and feeble translation of this famous novel has been hastily published by another house in this city, thus violating trade eti quette, as our edition has been announced several months.

THE DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES AND TURKEY, and a familiarity with seve ral European languages, have enabled the author of this volume to become so intimately acquainted with the inhabitants of the above countries, that no more capable individual, perhaps, could be found to relate truly, and in bo interesting a manner, the customs and characteristics of a people, together with such historical sketches and personal adventures as would form a capital book of travel. His object has been to give a truthful picture of the every day life of the people among whom he travelled, especially the poetical nations of the Lower Danube, whose names are scarcely known to American readers. What relates to humanity concerns all, and to know the beliefs and sentiments of our fellow beings, to learn with what songs, traditions, and pastimes they amuse each other, interests us more than the dry details of governments, or the mere impressions of the passing traveller. In order to make this work as attractive as possible it has been profusely embellished with twenty -four full page engravings, from original designs, upon wood, illustrative of objects of historical interest, together with such pictures of the life and manners at the present day as will make for the reader altogether the handsomest book of travel ever published in this country.

Here he has been streaming Eastern Europe and Western Asia, so hilarious and good-tempered all the time, so perfectly at home everywhere, so quick at making friends, so perfectly convinced that the world was made for American travellers and so apt at proving it by his own example, that his friends, who missed him for a while, not only were not astonished to find that he had been a Surgeon in the Ottoman army during this brief interval, but only wondered he had not been Grand Vizier. His book is full of fresh observations and lively descriptions, and as lively as a golden carp, just landed.
