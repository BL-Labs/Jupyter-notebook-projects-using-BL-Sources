Nicholas Bromley had entered his room buoyant and smiling, displaying no sign or token of impatience, but no sooner had Mrs Pratt closed the door against her inquisitive self than letter and notes were on the table under inspection. ' Um-ah ! Two fives and a ten. He might have made it thirty while he was about it. What are ten pounds to him ? ' The expression of his features as he muttered this was less of gratitude than dissatisfaction. He poured out a cup of tea and drank it before he ventured to take uo the. still folded letter for perusal. VOL. II. a"], [14, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 2 He found it more brief and curt than he had anticipated. It ran thus : \u2014 ' Son Nicholas, \u2014 I am amazed at your cheek in asking for money after all the sorrow and trouble you have brought upon me and your poor mother, and the burden you left for us to take up. We could not shirk our duty if you did. You ask for news. You want no news. You want nothing but the filthy lucre. Take it, and make good use of it. I enclose to help you to the partnership. I hope it is an honourable one. And mark you, this is the last you will touch of my money. And I shall not leave my hard-earned savings to Harriet, or even to her child at your dicta tion. What I have is my own. I have retired from business because we need rest and quiet ; so want no more letters from you to disturb us. \u2014 Your exasperated father, 'N. B.' 'Son Nicholas' might not have observed that the signature was not Bromley, or he passed it over with the muttered comment, ' Soh ! retired from business, has he ? Um,"], [15, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 3 I might, perhaps, have done better to stay and keep in with the old folk.' He bit his nail and pondered. Read the letter again. ' Um ! not too civil or affectionate. Well, as he's sent the needful I can dispense with flummery ; and I owe him one for his in junction not to write. He may rest assured I shall not disobey him. No risking a second epistle after the torment the one venture has caused me. However, I've got the needful, and may snap my fingers at the past.' The tall kitchen clock began to strike. Jacob kept it ten minutes in advance of the church clock to stimulate Mrs Pratt's punctuality. ' Dear me, ten-to-seven ! I must be off. Won't do to keep the expectant widow waiting on this momentous occasion.' As the words dropped from his lips Nicholas Bromley finished his tea in a scramble, whilst placing the precious notes within his pocket-book, and the letter, also mechanically, alongside other papers, then started to his feet, rang for his chamber candle, and in less than twenty minutes, all trim and spruce, with no coat-collar up, no muffler round his throat, he was hastening"], [16, "The Slowly Grinding Ahlls. 4 towards Moorside House, with all the speed his slight limp would permit. Never had Mrs Copeland found him more agreeable or confiding, For the first time she learned, as if from the natural outpouring of a frank nature, that his father was a man of substance, retired from business, and that he was an only son. He confessed with a sigh that there had been an estrangement between them, and that he had taken a country clerk ship in pique ; but having, as a matter of duty, acquainted his father with the early probability of his union with the sweetest and most amiable of women, he had that day received a tangible token of reconciliation. As if to prove his words, he drew forth his blue pocket-book, and, opening it, gave her just a glimpse of the well-worn bank notes thereinr leaving imagination to fill in the numbers. He grew quite eloquent on the reconcilia tion brought about by her means, and vowing that it made her a thousandfold more dear to him, pressed for an immediate union, clasping her waist the while as if he could not let her go. She hesitated, said there was no hurry she did not know what people would think"], [17, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 5 \u2014 and then there was Clarence, he did not know and \u2014 a \u2014 One by one he put down her objections ; asked if she was the slave of her son or her own mistress ? said that if her son loved her he would be only too pleased to see her happy, and to know her loneliness at an end. Hinted that people were already coupling their names together, and that for her sake he must keep away from her side, unless he had a stronger right to be there. And so well he argued that when he went away after supper, he carried with him a ring as a gauge for the size of another, and all was settled except the time and manner in which Clarence and others should be en lightened. A hamper filled with more than her ordinary motherly care was despatched to Clarence in the course of the following week, into which went a pair of warm slippers Irene had worked for his wear, but never a line to suggest a possibility of changes at home. The mother shrank with nervous timidity from the revelation, and be sure the bride groom-elect did not press it. He had reasons for secrecy he did not share with her."], [18, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 6 His chief aim was to keep the Sedgwicks in the dark until he was sure of his prize. The servants at Moorside House were taken aback by orders for winter house cleaning a week earlier than usual, and Thomas, whose duty it was to drive Mrs Copeland to the railway station, was heard to say, ' It's queer what a fancy our mistress has got of going off to Colbro', morning after morning, whether Miss Irene can go with her or she cannot.' But the coming of an upholsterer to measure for carpets and hangings for the upper rooms, partially accounted for the 'queer fancy,' and when these arrived, fol lowed from time to time by drapery, mil linery, glass and china, ' shopping ' was held to be an all - sufficient reason, though why the purchasing was on so extensive a scale created a controversy in the kitchen. ' It's never all on account of Mr Clarence coming home just for Christmas,' said cook, ' I know.' ' Nay,' said Dinah, with a wise nod of the head, ' it's all through the grand wedding there's going to be at the Manor House. Our mistress is not going to be outdone by"], [19, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 7 the Stanfields, and there'll be lots of visit ing when Lady Spencer, as is to be, comes home from her wedding-tower.' And Dinah was complimented on her saga city. There came a morning at the beginning of December when Mr Bromley did not turn up at the office. Half-an-hour \u2014 an hour went by ; then Jack was despatched to learn why Mr Bromley was not at his post. Back came Jack, racing down the street like mad, and met Miss Sedgwick in the passage. 'Oh! Miss Sedgwick, do you know Mr Bromley's never been home all night, and Mrs Pratt wonders what's become of him. He dressed himself and went off to Col borough after ten last night, and she's not seen him since. She's afraid something's happened.' Miss Selina put up her hands in amaze ment, clasped them together, and, with a quick ' You don't say so ? ' walked into her brother's office to ascertain what could be done. But although she had seen Mrs Copeland drive past soon after nine that morning, and"], [20, "8 The Slowly Grinding Mills. Thomas bring back the phaeton alone, for once her acumen was at fault. She did not for one moment couple that early drive to meet a probable train with the unexplained absence of her brother's clerk. Theobald received the intelligence in grim silence. 'What's to be done?' asked his sister. ' Nothing until he turns up or sends.' ' But suppose some accident has happened, and he cannot come.' ' No accident has happened or we should have heard.' ' Then why is he not here ? ' ' Ah, why ? Either to make me feel his loss now I've no nephew here to supply his place, or a worse piece of underhand schem ing. I've had my suspicions of my gentle man before to-day.' ' Can I help you as you are so busy ? ' Theobald scrawled a few words on paper. ' Take that telegram to the station. When you return you can make me a fair copy of this agreement.' Miss Selina was not a bad substitute for an en grossing clerk, as he well knew. She took both papers, and was gone without another word."], [21, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 9 The telegram was to Norman. It con sisted of one word, ' Hasten.' The following morning Mr Bromley walked into the office and hung up his hat and coat as composedly as if there had been no inter ruption to the course of his duties. If anything, there was an air of self-assured independence in his manner never before observable. ' I say, Mr Bromley, where were you yesterday ? ' questioned Jack, with the cool assurance of his sixteen years. 1 That is my business ; ' put him down as coolly. ' Well, I wouldn't stand in your shoes if it wasn't business most particular ; ' a thumb jerked over a shoulder pointing the speech, and to the inner office at the same time. A peculiar smile flitted over the face of the clerk. Theobald's gong sounded twice. That was for Mr Bromley. There was nothing apologetic in his ' Good morning.' Theobald eyed him curiously and ex pectantly. ' Well, sir ? ' he began. The clerk looked back at him, and waited in silence."], [22, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 10 'Well, sir,' resumed the other at .length. ' what account have you to render in extenua tion of your absence yesterday ? ' 'None. Private and important business detained me in Colborough.' ' Business so unexpected and engrossing that you could neither seek leave of absence,. nor send a message to excuse it ? ' sneered Theobald. Mr Bromley bowed, and smiled, an irritat ing self-complacent smile, displaying the whole of his white teeth. ' Well, sir, as your private business is so important as to supersede mine, you had better look out for a fresh engagement in the course of the month. I can dispense with your services,' was said sternly. Again Mr Bromley bowed. ' Ihave entered into a fresh engagement, sir/ ' The deuce you have ! ' burst from the grim old lawyer, startled out of his frigidity. ' Yes, sir ; and the sooner you can provide yourself with a substitute, the more you will oblige me.' ' I am already provided. You can take a week to put your papers and books in order up to date.'"], [23, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 11 Mr Bromley evinced no surprise. ' They are in perfect order, sir. Mr Norman will find everything regular any day he may arrive. Suppose we say a week hence : I am desirous to oblige.' ' Confound his impudence ! ' broke from Theobald Sedgwick, when his imperturbable clerk had retired with another cool bow, master of the situation. ' This is diamond cut diamond with a vengeance.' ' Checkmated at last, old Grumpy ! ' chuckled the clerk on the other side the baize-door. ' Did he imagine he was going to outwit me ? He thought to play a winning game, did he ? Only wait till I put down my last trump card. See if that does not astonish his weak nerves.' He was not inclined to delay his triumph. He had forestalled any report of ' dismissal ' by giving Mrs Pratt notice of his intended removal immediately on his return from Col borough the previous night. He had at the same time volunteered the statement that he had been away signing a contract for a better and more permanent engagement, fully aware that before he and Mr Sedgwick had adjusted their differences, half Highfield would be speculating on the loss the lawyer would"], [24, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 12 sustain, and echoing Mrs Pratt's wonder where his new situation lay. Wherever it might be, she thought her lodger was in a desperate hurry to get away, he began overhauling and packing his belong ings so promptly. This seemed to involve a good deal of tearing-up and burning of letters and papers ; she found so many ashes and burnt scraps on the hearth, bits of concert-pro grammes and play-bills amongst them. There was an old glazed cupboard in his room, the key of which never by any chance was left about or in the lock. There he kept his books and papers. There were not many of the former, and of those few were inviting. Yet he sighed heavily as he took down the worst of these, a ragged regiment of acting plays in drab paper covers. They were lined and scored throughout, and marked with an actor's hieroglyphics. * The best place for these is the fire,' he muttered gloomily ; ' there is no safer deposi tory for uncanny secrets.' And into the fire they went, one by one, until the ashes choked the fire. Then he turned out a law-book or two, from which, with a ready penknife, he carefully erased the original owner's name,"], [25, "On the Threshold of the Mill. 13 substituting that of Bromley. A few volumes of poems in fresh bindings were left intact ; but a set of dog-eared school-booksr chiefly Latin, a dictionary, and an Eton grammar amongst them, underwent the same scrutiny and erasure. In these the name he substituted was ' Asaph Pratt.' These he set apart by themselves whilst he dusted and packed all he considered worthy of preservation. Presently, as he expected, the front door was opened without ceremony, and he heard Asaph's voice in the passage. He took the pile of books up in his hand and met the youth at the open kitchen door. ' Here, Asaph,' said he, ' I have no further use for these, and they may probably be of service to you. You will find a Latin diction ary among them.' Asaph looked the donor in the face with open-eyed amazement. Mr Bromley was not noted for liberality. ' Oh, sir,' he cried, ' how shall I thank you ? It's the very book I've been at a loss for ever so many years. It will be such help to me.' ' So I surmised,' acquiesced Mr Bromley, retiring."], [26, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 14 ' You will have made Asaph your debtor for life,' chirped Jacob from his snug corner by the fire, as the other went, and Asaph almost gloated over his newly-acquired treasure. It was true Mr Elliott had placed his reference library at Asaph's service, but that was not like having books of his own, books he could keep in any corner to study at odd moments when ever he had an opportuuity. Mr Bromley plumed himself on an act of generosity, felt as if patronage was cheap and pleasant, but could he have known what he had given away as worthless to himself, he would have gnashed his teeth in rage at his own carelessness."], [27, "CHAPTER II. mr bromley's trump card. * Three removes are as bad as a fire,' so asserted Benjamin Franklin, and doubtless in his day and generation, when the furniture was not quite so heavy as the lumbering, springless carts and waggons employed for its transit, the axiom must have been a verity. Roads were primitive, repairs being done haphazard at long intervals, or left wholly undone ; and when a wheel, which was one minute uplifted high by a gnarled tree-root, or a chance boulder, and the next was down low in the depths of an eighteen-inch rut, the lurch was likely to play pitch-and-toss with hampers of glass and china, clocks and mirrors, and convert to match-wood the spindly limbs of chairs and tables. Then, if the elements were unfavourable, the rain soaked mattrasses and feather-beds, rusted the fenders and fire-irons, and washed away the polish from oak or mahogany, for seldom was '5"], [28, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 16 tarpaulin-sheet or other impervious cover available. Nay, sixty years since, when roads were in better condition, the proverb might still hold good, for conveyance was pretty much the same, and people removed so seldom, that an experienced packer was a rara avis. The breakage and damage occasioned by a distant removal, even forty years back, when railroads were in their infancy, could scarcely be credited in these days of lengthy covered pantechnicon vans, low to the ground and run ning on small, broad, strong wheels, with special receptacles for pictures and looking-glasses, and a tribe of trained attendants to pack all things up safely in the least possible compass. But no pantechnicon attendants can spare the individual about to 'flit' \u2014 I like the ex pressive north-country word \u2014 the discomfort attending the disruption of a long-seated house hold, of which a thorough spring-cleaning is but a faint foreshadowing. Let there be ample boxes and cases for all that is precious and breakable, all that is soft and foldable, let the carpets be up and the curtains down, and all ready for removal. Then comes the bewildering perplexity among"], [29, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 17 the nondescript etceteras, things that are too good to be discarded, yet scarcely worth the cost and trouble of removing or preserving ; things utterly worthless in themselves, to which pathetic association clings tenaciously, a broken toy, a worn garment, or any trifle consecrated by the use or touch of vanished hands ; old letters that call for ' cleansing fires,' yet de mand heroic sacrifice in the application of the fatal little lucifer. It was in the midst of such a medley of papers and relics, the debris of the home wrecked when his mother died, that Norman Sedgwick stood when his uncle's brief telegram was handed in. His two rooms, up many wearisome stairs, were wofully small for the furniture crowded into them, but rents in Furnival's Inn were out of all proportion to narrow incomes, and he must either have relin quished cherished articles when the bulk of their household goods were dispersed or submit to the overcrowding. In accepting his uncle's proposal, he had not taken his ' goods and chattels ' into considera tion ; and after portables were packed he had to confront the situation. His Aunt Selina evidently expected him to VOL. II. B"], [30, "18 The Slowly Grinding Mills. take up his abode with them. But what in that case could be done with his belongings ? Nothing would induce him to part with his mother's piano. There was none at his uncle's he knew, but he argued thence that the instru ment would be there unwelcome. ' Hasten! The word decided him. ' I must find lodgings,' he said to himself, ' and there I can take what I choose, and I can do pretty much as I please. It will be de cidedly the best. My habits might clash with those of the old people, and I might chafe under the restraint of their precise arrange ments day by day. It will be much the best. I need not then sacrifice all I hold precious, and in case Uncle Theobald and I do not agree, I shall be able to start afresh here re spectably.' He made his selection, not too easily ; called in a broker, and after some sharp bargaining, let him sweep off the rest. The broker found him a packer, and the morning after the receipt of the telegram, one of Pickford's vans turned out of Holborn into Furnival's Inn, and carried thence a load of cases and packages, labelled, 'To await Orders.' The key of his room was"], [31, "Mr Bromley' s Trump Card. 19 surrendered. There was a hurried rush to Lincoln's Inn to say farewell to his mother's old friend, Mr Gifford, who, without his pro fessional spectacles, congratulated him most warmly, more so, indeed, than Norman thought the occasion warranted, seeing that the old gentleman knew so little of his Uncle Sedgwick. It would be difficult to say whether the old bachelor and his sister were more surprised to find Norman at their breakfast - table that Thursday morning, or Mr Bromley to discover him in the office when he sauntered in. ' Deucedly sharp work this ! ' he ejaculated, mentally. ' Only yesterday the old chap and I cried \"quits.\" He might well say he was pre pared. It was lucky I had taken time by the forelock. I was not a day too soon. The young sprig must have come down last night.' So Norman had. But, not to disturb his relatives at bed-time, he had supped and slept at the New Inn. ' You had better sit with me in my office until Bromley goes,' said Mr Sedgwick, 'you will then be introduced to our chief clients, and not rub shoulders with that underbred sneak.' ' Sneak ! ' so had the clerk been dubbed by the boys at Rugby."], [32, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 20 ' You will find your room quite ready for you, Norman,' said his aunt, 'and if there is any thing you would like altering, it shall be done for you.' 'You are very kind, dear aunt,' replied he, ' but do not make any difference on my account. I know the room is comfortable, and for the short time I shall require it, no change could be necessary in any case.' ' Short time ! What do you mean ? ' Miss Selina looked at him as if aghast. ' Well, aunt, I think it will be best if I find lodgings in the village. I may be very well as a visitor, but my London hours and habits would probably interfere with yours, and \u2014 ' She interrupted him. ' Oh, my boy, we have been looking forward to having you as an inmate under our own roof! ' ' Yes, aunt, but did you expect me to bring furniture along with me ? ' ' Furniture ! ' she echoed in blank surprise. 'Yes, my mother's piano, the old Indian cabinet, and other things.' Her countenance fell. ' Her piano ! For Heaven's sake, Norman, don't so much as name it to your uncle. You are right. That cannot come here. But where to find you suitable"], [33, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 21 lodgings I have no idea, even if Theobald will consent to it. People here don't let lodgings.' ' Do you think Mr Bromley will remain in Highfield? He must have rooms somewhere.' ' That is a singular coincidence ! ' she ex claimed. ' It was only last night Mrs Pratt told Betty that Mr Bromley was going away, and asked her if she thought the new clerk would like to look at her rooms.' ' Pratt, Pratt ! Was not that the name of the musical parish clerk who fiddled so capably at that Scotch pitman's wedding ? ' A nod as an affirmative. ' Then, that will be the very thing. We should not disturb each other.' ' But, my boy, we do not want to put you on Mr Bromley's level. The rooms are not at all in your line.' ' That is a broad assertion, Aunt Selina. Are they clean ? ' ' Scrupulously. But the furniture is poor and common.' Norman smiled ' What I bring may rectify all that. And / have learned not to be over fastidious. / will mention the matter to my uncle.' Miss Selina appeared relieved."], [34, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 22 Theobald drew his thick brows together when Norman mooted the subject to him, and looked him in the face suspiciously. ' So, you don't care to spend your evenings with two severe antediluvians ! I'd a notion how it would be.' ' I will spend as many evenings with you as you may care for, but I feel assured my resid ence here would interfere with the established routine of the household, and cause Aunt Selina extra work. My London hours and habits would certainly clash with yours, and though you or I might be willing to make concessions, and submit to small inconveniences, they would be felt as concessions and inconveniences. I sit up late reading. I relieve study with music. In the latter respect I am afraid I should be come an intolerable nuisance to you. If we think differently after a time, we may make fresh arrangements.' \u2022 Ugh ! You seem to make yours with prompt independence. But have your own way. It may be more satisfactory to all parties in the end. I presume you have been a free agent so long you do not care to restrict your liberty.' ' Precisely so.'"], [35, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 23 ' Ugh ! you will surrender it some day, and not feel you make a concession.' A queer smile flitted across the face of the old man, as a slight flush rose to the cheeks of the younger, to disappear in lines of gravity as he replied, \u2014 ' That day is too far distant for consideration. We have to deal with the present. And now, uncle, having hastened hither in answer to your telegram, I await your business instructions.' ' Urn ! I see \u2014 business for business hours. Quite right, Norman.' And forthwith they proceeded to business. That was Thursday. Before closing time on the Saturday Mr Bromley called his governor's attention to papers, books, etc., under his charge as being in perfect order, remarking with polite condescension, \u2014 ' And now, sir, as Mr Norman is already here, and I have done all in my power to facilitate his introduction into my seat, may I ask you to relieve me from my engagement at once ? Of course, I do not wish to incommode you by premature retirement, but it would best suit my personal arrangements.' ' Oh, go at once, by all means,' cried Theobald Sedgwick ; ' it will best suit my arrangements,"], [36, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 24 too. Here, take your salary, give me a receipt and the key of your desk. \u2014 There, that closes our account. Good morning.' ' Perhaps not,' muttered Mr Bromley, as he took his hat and bowed. Good morning.' ' What does the fellow mean by his \" perhaps not \" ? ' jerked out the irritated old gentleman. ' Did you hear him, Norman ? ' calling to his nephew through the open doorway. ' Yes, I heard, but have no explanation to offer. Time will doubtless furnish a solution.' ' Ay, as it ripens crops and plots. That fellow is a plotter. There was some hidden meaning in his words. His new-born self assurance staggers me.' A whole congregation was metaphorically staggered the next morning. Mr Bromley, exquisitely got up in a new overcoat, glossy silk hat, and light kid gloves, walked up the aisle of the church side by side with the lady known as Mrs Copeland, and when Mrs Pratt, with a peculiarly knowing smirk on her face, opened the Copeland pew door, both passed in, and he took his seat by the entrance, where the dead Mr Copeland or his living son had been won't to sit. Amazement sat on all faces. It was observed"], [37, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 25 that the grey silk dress and bonnet of the lady, despite her seasonable trimming of soft chin chilla, were more suggestive of a bridal than of midwinter. Questioning glances were ex changed, and more eyes rested on that pew than on the pulpit through the whole service. ' Theobald, do you see that ? What does it mean ? ' whispered Miss Selina to her brother in some trepidation. ' Mean ? ' he growled ; ' why, that he's a knave, and she's a fool \u2014 and I've been another,' he muttered between his teeth. There was a murmur of voices in the porch. Then Mrs Pratt, with conscious importance, ushered Mr and Mrs Stanfield and their daugh ters to the Squire's pew. But all their eyes were averted from that other pew across the aisle, and as the door closed upon them the crimson curtains were closely drawn as if to shut out an offensive sight. Miss Preston, the Rector's chubby sister, was for once the sole occupant of the clerical pew, which she did her best to fill. A word from Mrs Pratt had sent Irene back to the Rectory sobbing as if her very heart would break. Possibly the Rector had been enlightened by his clerk, for there was more of severity than of"], [38, "26 The Slowly Grinding Mills. benignity in the sharp glance he shot down upon the pair who had not come to him for the joining of hands or the after benediction. Nicholas Bromley had calculated on creating a sensation, yet he was scarcely answerable for the surprise on all faces. The local postman had duly distributed around a select circle that very morning the silver-edged wedding-cards of 'Mr Nicholas Bromley,' and ' Mrs Nicholas Bromley.' Had the sensible custom of intimating the lady's previous name prevailed at that time no confusion would have arisen, and astonishment would have exhausted itself over the breakfast table. As it was, Mr Bromley was only recog nised as Mr Sedgwick's clerk, and no one of Mrs Copeland's own friends would have dreamed of linking her name with his. ' Who are those people ? Can we know them ? ' had been feminine questions from old Lady Spencer downwards, whilst ' Dash his impudence ! ' ' The presumptuous ass ! ' and even stronger epithets had greeted the cards from masculine lips. At Lawyer Sedgwick's no letters were ever opened on the Sunday morning. ' When the wicked man turneth away from"], [39, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 27 his wickedness,' sounded as a recall to serious ness, and outwardly the service proceeded with all decorum to its close. In large communities one half a congregation will have no knowledge of the other half, beyond a vague impression of faces' and gar- ments, but in a country church the converse is the rule. Tradespeople and peasantry, de- pending more upon the farmers and the gentry, come into frequent contact, and they know each other from the cradle to the grave. The same rule does not hold good in a mining district. Pit population is somewhat more nomadic. A pit or a seam gets worked out, or is closed by some untoward accident, and then follows a general exodus from the village in search of work elsewhere. The miner is a graft, not always a plant rooted in the soil ; his father and grandfather were not hewing and putting for the father and grandfather of the Squire or the colliery-owner, consequently there is less of mutual sympathy and individual interest, more of independence among the colliers, and less of deference to superiors than obtains, or did obtain, among agricultural labourers. There was a sprinkling of both elements"], [40, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 28 among the Rector's very mixed congregation, and the mining so far predominated as to do away with the time-honoured custom of stand ing up at the close of the service and waiting until the Squire, or others from the great houses, walked out of the church in advance. Fully half the congregation had dispersed before Mr and Mrs Bromley, smiling graciously on each other and on those they encountered right and left, joined the general stream. But not until their pew was vacant, and only the Sunday scholars, kept in check by their teachers, remained in deference to the Squire, were the Stanfield curtains drawn aside to let the family emerge. A social problem had to be solved, but not within those consecrated walls. They found outside, the congregation separ ated into little knots and cliques, all indemnify ing themselves for enforced silence in comments various as the people. It was clear the widow had violated all the canons of social propriety, not alone in marry ing beneath her, but marrying in disgraceful secrecy. Meanwhile, she and her new husband had stopped to exchange a few words with different individuals, mostly her own tenants, on their"], [41, "Mr Bromley's Trump Card. 29 way to the church gates, but their reception from the lady's old friends was too stiff to be exhilarating. Mr Bromley had taken the reins, and the phaeton was rolling away, with discontented Thomas on the back-seat, when the Stanfields walked leisurely down the flagged path. Just within the gates they observed Theobald Sedgwick and his sister with preternaturally stiffened spines, engaged in conversation with little Dr Elliott, whilst Norman close beside them looked around him with apparent indiffer ence, which vanished on their approach. Dr Elliott was saying, ' I've had my sus picions ever since the night he fell and hurt his hip in the woods ' \u2014 Avhen the Squire broke in with, \u2014 ' I say, Sedgwick, what do you think of this ? ' interrupting Miss Selina's ejaculation, \u2014 ' Why, he said it Avas his ankle ! ' ' I don't give my private opinions in public,' was the answer, in a caustic tone, that was in itself an opinion.

' Well,' said the Squire, ' I understand now why he wanted to ferret out the terms of the colliery partnership. It's a bad look-out for Clarence. She will never have thought of settlements, not she !

' ' Hush, Beatrice,' whispered Octavia, who had seen the crimson flush- mounting to Norman's brow, and a sudden quiver of his sensitive nostrils ; ' do set a curb upon your tongue.' The sister smiled. Her wordy arrow had transfixed two birds, and she rejoiced. Their father had taken up the spent shaft, and was saying, ' Well, I see rocks ahead for all of us. This marriage will create strange complications. How we are to deal with the wife and ignore the scheming husband perplexes me. I shall have to consult with you to morrow, Mr Sedgwick. And I confess I am troubled about Clarence. I question whether he has been consulted.' ' Ah, poor Clarence ! ' ran like an echo from lip to lip, as the party shook hands and separated at the lawyer's door."], [44, "32 CHAPTER I II. ON ALL SIDES. ' Poor Clarence ! ' This was the burden of Highfield conversation among the intimates of the Copeland family all the remainder of that day, and for many days. In lower social strata ' Poor Mr Clarence ' smoothed many a rough and rugged tongue. Thomas, driving the phaeton back to fetch the newly wedded pair from church, stopped by the chapel steps, and let the sorrowful words slip whilst imparting his doleful intelligence to his old crony Jeremiah Trench, and the flying echoes were caught up by the dis persing Wesleyans until they reached that newly-married couple in the rear, over whom still hung the cloud of the zealot's displeasure, in spite of the Squire's intervention. 'Poor Mr Clarence,' said Nelly as she and Ben, arm in arm, took their way down Moorside Lane. ' It will come hard to him"], [45, "On all Sides. 33 to have a stepfather, and one as isn't a gentleman born. And he's been looked up to as the young master ever since his father died. There's like to be hot work in Moorside House when he comes home, if he's been kept in the dark, for, though he was always a good natured young gentleman, he had a mighty high spirit when put upon.' ' Ay, he's a braw young chiel, but he'll no tak' kindly to a writer's clerk for a stepfaither, I'm minded. There's like to be dour wark in the big hoose gin he hae nae been con soolted.' In a few minutes the phaeton came rattling swiftly down hill. Ben turned his head over his left shoulder and caught sight of the driver's face as it passed. ' Hech, Nellie ! gin that's Maister Brom ley, there's a varra thunner-cloud on his brow. I wadna gie a bawbee for the guid leddy's chance o' happiness wi' siccan a dour bride groom by the lum side.' The vehicle was drawn up sharply at the gate. Mr Bromley sprang out on the instant, and doubtless gave his hip a jerk in the hasty leap, for his brow again contracted.

Ben and Nelly had involuntarily stayed their steps to leave the path clear for their ' betters ' to cross. Mrs Bromley's attention was arrested, she paused to say a kindly word or two, to ask if their cottage was comfortable, if they were reconciled to Jeremiah Trench, and to wish them much happiness in return for their good wishes. But Ben noticed her husband's fingers twiddling impatiently with his coat bottons, and the restraint of his \u2014 ' Come, my dear, we are keeping dinner waiting.' His rough call to Thomas had wakened up Ben's slumbering memory. ' Guid sake, Nell, gin yon isna the chiel as twice ower dunted me off the causey in the mirk, an' hadna a ceevil word o' apology tae fling at a body !

Before Betty had well cleared away the"], [47, "On all Sides. 35 Sedgwick dinner- things, there was a knock at the street door, and in came Irene Pres ton, with a veil over her face to hide her swollen eyelids and discoloured cheeks. 'Oh, godfather,' she began, heedless or un observant of Norman's presence, as he stood between door and window. ' Oh, Miss Selina, is not this dreadful ? What will poor Clarence say or do ? I am convinced he does not know, or we should have heard either from him or Herbert. And he loves his mother so dearly. It will be such a blow to him. They have been all in all to each other.' ' Ugh,' growled Theobald; 'it's a bad busi ness altogether.' ' Well, my dear,' mildly put Miss Sedgwick, whilst loosening the strings of the girl's bonnet, ' we have all been taken by surprise. But how is it that you, who have been her constant com panion and like a daughter to her, had no sus picion, no intimation ? ' ' I don't know ; I don't know ; ' and Irene flung herself in abandonment on to a stool by her godfather's feet, her tears streaming afresh. ' Mrs Copeland used to tell me everything. She said that Mr Bromley was doing business for her, looking over accounts, and collecting her"], [48, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 36 rents ; but we took it for granted he was acting for godfather, who had only just got down stairs.' ' Ugh, the treacherous knave ! ' interjected Theobald. 'And of late,' went on the girl with a sob, ' she has never so much as named him. Aunt has noticed that she has not pressed me to stay with her at night as she used, and that she has gone by herself to Colborough. Aunt asked me if I had offended her. And, oh ! I did not think dear, dear Mamma Copeland could act so \u2014 so secretly \u2014 and \u2014 and so deceitfully. She used to tell me everything. It is that cuts me up worst of all.' Norman here thrust in his oar, meaning to soften matters, no one else attempting it, his uncle and aunt looking their very grimmest and stiffest, though the poor girl's distress gave him pain. 'Assuredly, Miss Irene, your friend appears to have taken everyone by surprise. Still, such freaks are by no means uncommon, and you must have known that Mrs Copeland was dull and lonely. Indeed, she complained to me of the colourless monotony of her existence, with neither son nor husband by her side in her"], [49, "On all Sides. 37 large, solitary habitation. Then she is com paratively young, and if her son be reasonable he would not expect her to remain single for his sake. In matrimony everyone has a right to exercise his or her private judgment.' ' Her judgment ! Pah ! she has no judgment,' snarled the old fellow. Irene suddenly raised her head from her god father's knee, where it had rested despondingly. ' Not expect her to keep single for his sake. Ah ! you don't know Clarence. I'm sure she might have done. But \u2014 there \u2014 if she had married a gentleman it would not be so bad. What will poor Clarence say ? ' and Irene clasped her hands together piteously. 'Well, dear, don't distress yourself,' said Miss Selina with softened voice, her own eyes suspiciously dim, ' you had better write and ascertain. It will not do for us to interfere ; yet I should not like the boy to come home for his Christmas holidays in ignorance.' ' Nay, nay ; Irene had better do nothing of the kind. Why should she write to him on such a subject ? ' interposed Theobald, per emptorily, with a sharp glance at his sister. Then gently smoothing down, with his gaunt hand, the shining head resting so disconsolately"], [50, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 38 against his knee, he said, in another tone, ' Ask your father to write, Blossom ; he is the fittest person in all respects. It is a delicate subject to deal with. He will do it discreetly and with pastoral authority.' ' Possibly,' thought Norman, ' he may write paternally, but the girl would be more sym pathetic ; and, if I'm any judge of character, she will take her own course, young as she is.' But he did not think it worth while to com municate his opinion. ' Norman,' said his uncle confidentially to him when both Irene and Miss Selina were out of the room after tea, ' suppose you accompany my pretty Blossom to the Rectory. You can then suggest to Mr Preston the advisability of a few lines to Rugby from him, just to prevent unneces sary unpleasantness when Clarence Copeland comes on the scene. I'm sorry to say the lad will be greatly in that rascal's power, and he will have to hold the candle to the devil.' It will be seen there was a general jumping to conclusions, both respecting the son's know ledge and the stepfather's tendencies. Supposition was in some degree justified. Mrs Copeland's natural timidity, coupled with a sort of bashful consciousness of foolish weak-"], [51, "On all Sides. 39 ness, had caused her to defer from day to day the unpleasant task of revelation to her son \u2014 a duty Mr Bromley had anything but impressed upon her. In fact, his indirect influence had run counter to any premature confidence with anyone likely to oppose his schemes, or to bias her weak mind against him \u2014 her son most of all. It was this fear of adverse opinion and influ ence that had led him to suggest a speedy and secret marriage in Colborough, with no witnesses but an old schoolfellow of hers, and the clerk of the church. He had selected St Mary's Church for the ceremony, because it lay, as it were, hid in an obscure corner, though he gave a more senti mental reason to her. Her own leaning would have been towards a little of the dash and display of a wedding surrounded by friends, and solemnised in her own parish church ; but she had fallen in with his plans, partly from a consciousness of pre cipitation, and partly from an inchoate percep tion of her own unwisdom. She had not suffered Clarence to lose sight of her solitariness and need of a companion, and she had gone so far as to hope that he"], [52, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 40 would ' like the companion she had chosen ' ; but she had not since supplied a key to what had become an equivoque. But, after running the gauntlet through the ranks of friends and acquaintances that morning as Mrs Bromley, she had become painfully conscious of her shortcomings as a mother towards a beloved son, and, during the silent drive home, had resolved to take courage and make open confession. The sharp tone in which her new husband had spoken to her old servant had almost driven her resolution out of her head, with its strange suggestiveness of an unsuspected phase of his character. He was, however, conscious of his error on the instant, and lost no time in repairing it. ' When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive,' had fallen that day on receptive soil. Whatsoever had blotted the pages of Nicholas Bromley's previous life, he had then and there resolved to close the volume of the past, and open a fresh account with Heaven so as to present the fair record of a respectable life at its close."], [53, "On all Sides. 41 He had not calculated on an immediate stumbling-block in the cold looks and averted heads of those whose cordial friendship he had calculated on claiming in right of his wife and of the property, landed and personal, acquired by his marriage. He had been reared in a school where money was the appraisable standard of value in men and manners ; where birth was nothing, cash everything. He had known how low a man can sink without the golden touchstone, and had built upon the heights he would attain by its possession. In the supreme moment when the Church pronounced them 'man and wife,' he had drained the cup of intoxication to the dregs. If he saw the image of an asp in the cup, he flung it behind him, rejoicing in the belief that with a tiny golden circlet he had bought a wife and all her possessions whatsoever they might be. (No 'Woman's Property Act' had then been formulated to stand between him and his marital rights.) He had attained the summit of his ambition (how, was known only to him self) and would take his seat at once among the landed gentry. Such was the written law, as he read it. But he had suddenly come face to face with"], [54, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 42 an unwritten law, unknown to his legal or social experience. A straggler from extreme East London, he found himself in a village com munity where blood was everything, and 'blunt,' as he phrased it, was nothing, except as an accessory to birth. So long as he was merely Lawyer Sedgwick's clerk he was re ceived with a certain degree of respect, if not of cordiality. He had won his way to popular opinion by his active interest in the Mechanics' Institute. But no sooner had he leapt at a bound over other heads into the seat of the dead Mr Copeland than he was pronounced a usurper, and the smallest shopkeeper or artisan was disposed to asked for his pedigree ' as if he had been a horse.' Such was his bitter conclusion as he took his seat for the first time in his own phaeton, the smile on his face darkening to the thunder cloud Ben Saunders had observed, and he drove the ponies home at full speed, turning the chapel corner at random, ' for all the world like a butcher's boy, not a gentleman,' as Thomas in his aggravation declared to the maids in the kitchen. The three minutes occupied by Mrs Bromley in affable speech with Saunders and his wife"], [55, "On all Sides. 43 sufficed to restore the outward calm of the angry man, though the fire of a volcano raged below. No sooner was he alone with his bride, than in pursuance of the policy resolved upon in church, he drew her towards him caressingly, and said apologetically, \u2014 ' My dearest Anna, I am afraid I spoke somewhat roughly to Thomas just now. I should be sorry to hurt the feelings of a faithful old servant, but I must confess I had been greatly annoyed by the coolness of our reception by your personal friends this morning. It was not for myself at all, for what am I but a stranger amongst them, but for you, my own dearest, who surely were at home, I confess I felt indignant and irritated. Can you assign any reason for their want of courtesy ? ' She looked down, played with the rings upon her ungloved hand, and answered hesi tatingly, ' Ah, no, unless our cards had not been delivered, and \u2014 a \u2014 the privacy of our marriage gave offence.' ' All local cards would be delivered this morning, dear, without fail. I posted them myself, and had our postmaster's assurance."], [56, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 44 And the privacy of our marriage should offend no one. It should rather be regarded as a tribute to delicacy. To me it appears absurd and ridiculous for a woman of mature years to go flaunting to church, with a bevy of bridesmaids, to take a second husband, as if she were a maiden in her teens.' 'Ah, so you said before, Nicholas, dear, and perhaps you are right,' with a faint sigh, ' but I was all along afraid it would be said I ran \u2014 a \u2014 off secretly because I was a \u2014 a \u2014 ashamed to let people know I was \u2014 a \u2014 marrying \u2014 ' ' What, madam ?

It was pretty generally understood that Mrs Copeland had been left wholly unfettered by her late husband's will ; and equally familiar was the married man's complacent dictum, whether uttered in jest or earnest \u2014 ' What's yours is mine, what's mine is my own.' Consequently the transfer of ownership and authority brought about by that marriage was an important con- sideration alike for tenants-at-will and more independent colliers. The dead Mr Copeland had been kind and considerate, his mild-spoken widow still more easy and obliging, until the business man came to the front who was now to be master ; a man they intuitively classed as an upstart, not a gentleman. A sharp, clear frost had set in the previous day, but it was not that which tempted people from their homes so much as the burning ques tions to be settled alike on cottage hearths and in scented drawing-rooms."], [60, "48 The Slowly Grinding Mills. The excitement spread, and all the following week the village was lively with the vehicles and riding-horses of people who were ' some bodies ' in the county, who made morning calls, or stopped in the main thoroughfares to exchange greetings and discuss the topic of the hour. ' Who is this Mr Bromley ? ' ' Pray who are his people ? ' ' Can we possibly visit them ? ' were questions asked alike in tones of languid indifference and eager interest. ' And how will the marriage affect the son ? ' was of moment to anxious mammas with daughters out-growing the schoolroom, to whom Clarence had hitherto been an eligible in prospective. That was one of the points occupying the attention of Squire Stanfield and Lawyer Sedg wick the whole of the Monday afternoon, when the latter was denied to all other clients, who had to be content with Norman as a substitute, or make an appointment. Miss Sedgwick had her quota of callers. But she was as impassive and unresponsive as the Sphinx. She knew nothing, and could give neither information nor opinion. ' You might as well try to elicit anything from a stone statue as from her,' was the comment of more than one disappointed querist."], [61, "Undercurrents. 49 The Rector was not so reticent. He had accepted the office Theobald Sedgwick had laid upon him, as a matter of conscience, and had written to Clarence. Indeed he could not well do otherwise after Norman had delivered him self of his message, it was done with so much tact ; and his own affectionate regard for the youth was so sincere. Still the subject was distasteful, and he counselled Clarence to accept without demur the stepfather his mother had provided, with so little personal good-will to wards his task, that his letter lacked his custom ary spontaneous cordiality. And no sooner was it despatched to post and beyond recall, than he took himself to task for ' shooting Theobald Sedgwick's bullets,' letting ' himself be made a cat's-paw for the lawyer.'

Yet every newcomer seemed to ad minister a special pin-prick to his cushion of individuality in utter ignorance how he was fuming and chafing under the infliction, until he mentally compared himself to Regulus rolling round and round in his spiky barrel. His patience soon gave way. ' / shall not visit them,' he said with abrupt decision, his ruddy face deepening in tint, ' and I shall not permit any further intercourse with my daughter or sister.' 'Oh, papa!' pleaded Irene in a tone of en treaty, ' you cannot mean that ? ' ' How can you possibly avoid it in your clerical capacity ? ' put in Miss Preston and their visitor in a breath. ' I shall avoid it. The new curate who comes in January may do all that is imperative in that line. I consider we have been trifled with.'

It was evident that he meant what he said, but not one of his hearers suspected how de cided a truth he uttered. Nay, his unpreme ditated speech expressed more than himself intended. It so happened that fully half his indignation, and all his disgust, were due to the unrevealed fact that he, the Reverend Richard Preston, had cherished a fond idea of converting ' Mam ma Copeland ' into ' Mamma Preston,' by the process of natural selection when a reasonable period of mourning for the dead had expired. And this baulked intention \u2014 of which no one but himself was cognisant \u2014 bubbling under the surface, provoked a display of irritation and ill humour out of the common, when one after another influential parishioner came to remind him unconsciously of all he had lost by con scientious delay."], [64, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 52 Indeed, the marriage appeared to be more a public than a private consideration, and it is surprising how unanimous was general opinion on the impossibility of visiting the old friend now she had been transformed into Mrs Brom ley \u2014 a stranger \u2014 even with those who held that neither the Rector nor the Stanfields could well avoid mutual intercourse as of old. The importance of the subject to these two families was nowhere lost sight of. Quite an animated discussion was going on in the blue drawing-room of the Manor House at the very time the Squire was closeted with Theobald Sedgwick. ' My dear Mrs Stanfield,' cried elderly Lady Spencer, with the effusion of a girl, ' I greatly sympathise with you and your charming daughters in your trying position.

Besides, Herbert will be sure to resent any affront to his chum.' ' Really, my dears,' chimed in Mrs Stanfield wearily, ' our dear old friend has set us a most perplexing tangle to unravel.' Beatrice flushed angrily. ' Yes, and she did it with her eyes open. She must have known the consequences of marrying a mere lawyers clerk. We are fully justified in cutting them. She could expect no other.' The covert allusion to the 'mere lawyer's clerk ' was not new to Octavia. She had some ado to keep her rising colour down.

Sir John had been twirling his long mous tache somewhat nervously. He came for ward. ' When business relations and social rela tions clash, they require to be separated and kept apart. No doubt, Octavia, that will be the decision of the Squire. Society would be subverted otherwise. As we fence round our park-lands to distinguish and preserve them from surrounding waste and common, so is society guarded and hedged round. It is not for those within the pale to break down the barriers for vulgar interlopers. I admit that a solicitor is professionally a gentleman ; and the scholarly articled-clerk, who is simply a solicitor in embryo, may be a gentleman also. But this man Bromley is neither the one nor the other. Beatrice quite understands that we must draw the line at such as he.'"], [67, "Undercurrents. 55 There was a murmur of assent from three of the four ladies. Beatrice glanced across the glowing hearth towards her younger sister with lofty self-approval. ' Certainly,' she acquiesced, adding sarcas tically.

Octavia had moved towards the door as she spoke. As the last words left her lips she turned the handle and quitted the room, leav ing the others in blank amazement to digest her remarks in her absence. Five minutes later she was on her way to the Rectory to confer with Irene in private, and as it turned out to comfort and strengthen the younger girl, rendered doubly disconsolate by her father's peremptory mandate. However, before successive visitors had"], [69, "Undercurrents. 57 chafed the Rector to its unpremeditated utter ance, a letter from Irene was on the way to Clarence. As Norman had conjectured, she had poured out her distress and her sympathies on paper before she retired to bed that memorable Sunday night, her tears falling on the sheet as she wrote.

Compressing her lips together, she tore the written sheets into strips and into morsels ; then keeping back her tears, she began afresh, thinking less of her emotions than of preserv ing peace between Clarence and his mother ; though there was no disguising the fact that she sympathised with her ' best of brothers ' with more than sisterly intensity.

She was always an early riser, and it was in the post before either Mrs Bromley's or her own father's. But they reached Clarence simultaneously, and companioned by two for Herbert ; both the Squire and Octavia having thought the occasion warranted letter-writing on the quiet Sunday afternoon. The Squire's was brief enough. It ran thus : \u2014 ' Highfield Manor House, 'Dec. 1 8th, 185 \u2014 ' Dear Bert, \u2014 Don't explode ! and don't set your neighbour's gunpoAvder alight !

In his own interest he must keep on good terms with his new stepfather, or he can turn him out of doors. All the decided provision for him is in connection with the colliery ; but I am doubtful how far we may be able to secure even that provision to him during his long minority, until I have con ferred with Mr Sedgwick. So keep Clarence cool if you can. There will be time for him to tone down before the end of term, pro vided he does nothing rash at the outset. I rely on your discretion, my dear boy. Do not disappoint ' Your affectionate father, ' Ernest Stanfield. That was a smart stroke of the Squire's. Herbert was not renowned for more discre tion than other schoolboys of seventeen ; and he was known to hold Sedgwick's too obliging clerk in small favour. But his father's express reliance on his judgment was something for a son to be proud of. The draft upon his manhood would surely not be dishonoured."], [72, "60 CHAPTER V. ECHOES OF WEDDING BELLS. ' Hullo ! What's up ? Here's a batch of home news, two for me and three for you. I say, we're in luck,' cried Herbert, all aglow as he broke the vermilion seal of his father's missive. Octavia's perfumed billet might wait. She was his general correspondent. The Pater's letters were rare, and valued accord ingly. His exultation died away as he read. He had barely scanned the first page when a deep groan and a heart-wrung cry from Clarence drew his attention to the pallid face of his friend. There he sat at their study-table with staring eyes fixed on a sheet of tinted paper which rattled in a trembling clutch, then fell from relaxing fingers, too nerveless to uphold the head that drooped above them. Herbert's arm was round the bent shoulders on the instant."], [73, "Echoes of Wedding Bells. 61 ' Here, I say, old chap, don't give way like this. It's bad enough, I'll own, but there's never anything so bad but it might be worse. The fellow may be better than we lads thought him after all.' ' Better ! ' shouted Clarence, rousing- with a quick hot revulsion of feeling ; ' better ! ' he reiterated. ' He is a despicable sneak and scoundrel. If I had him here, I'd shake the very life out of him.' Big words from the overgrown youth of seventeen, whatever might be his prowess in the football field, but in his rising wrath and scorn he felt as if he could cope with a giant. ' The hypocrite,' he went on, ' creeping into the widow's house on false pretences, and playing on her fears for his own base ends. Oh, that I only had him in the Close now, I'd pound him to a jelly. I'd knock every one of those grinning white teeth of his down his rascally throat.' ' Serve him right \u2014 ' began Herbert, then stopped short. He had seen that his father's letter advocated a different policy, although his eyes had not yet taken in the written reasons. ' I see it all now, Bert ; he must have begun his game directly I was out of the way. All my mother's lamentations over her dull and"], [74, "62 The Slowly Grinding Mills. monotonous life ; her dread of robbers at night ; her helplessness over her accounts ; her need of a companion ; they were all but echoes of the tune he was playing on her unsuspicious nature. And it has led to this. Oh, I feel as if I should choke, Bert,' and he dropped again into his seat, with his hand to his throat, struggling for utterance. ' To think \u2014 only to think that such a fellow should take the place of my noble father in less than eighteen months ; and not a line, not a word to prepare his son for such a catastrophe, or to break the news when the treacherous deed was done ! ' And he set his teeth upon the words, drawing his breath between them with a sibilant sound of pain. ' Perhaps your mother had not the courage to tell you. She may think he has done it,' suggested the other. ' But you have not read all your letters. Is not the one you have crumpled up from Irene Preston ?' ' Yes ; the dear, good girl ! I could not at first see the drift of her long, forewarning pre face. She must have been half conscious of my utter ignorance, and felt that hers would be the first revelation.

I am in no humour for particulars.' Rising once more, he thrust the obnoxious letters from him as they lay together upon the table, and turned gloomily towards the narrow window. In so doing he laid bare the two unopened. Herbert pounced on one. ' Here, I say, this is from the Mater. I know her hand.' ' There, let it lie. It comes too late for me to interpose \u2014 too late by a day to cajole me into submissive acceptance of \u2014 of \u2014 my dear father's successor \u2014 the mean scamp ! Oh ! Bert, Bert, it is the underhand treachery of it all that makes me furious. When did my dear, dear mother conceal anything from me before? It is all that subtle Bromley's doings. I wish he had broken his rascally neck that night he fell in our wood. He has robbed me of the best of mothers. I feel \u2014 I know she is lost to me for ever, and it drives me crazy.' Herbert had by this time mastered the whole of the Squire's epistle, with its charge to him self.

I'll not set foot in Moorside House whilst that man is master,' and the boy's sensitive nostrils panted defiantly. ' I shall write and tell them so.' ' Don't you think that would be a proof you stood in need of a master, and justify the Mater in giving you one ? ' ' God bless the dear Mater ! It's not so much against her marriage I rebel, as the sly ness, the secrecy, the underhand meanness of it all, and the man who has made it possible to her. If she had given me Major Bathurst for a stepfather, I'd have been content to obey him. He's a soldier and a gentleman, not a sneaking lawyer's clerk.' Herbert had sense to see that Clarence chafed the more at every fresh argument, and sensibly refrained from whipping the top he was anxious should subside. ' Well, but I say,' he began, ' we are losing sight of the masters here who have to be"], [77, "Echoes of Wedding Bells. 65 obeyed. Time's scurrying on, and neither you nor I shall pass to-morrow's exam, if we shirk our \" swalting \" at the last push. Here are the books ; we have not a minute to lose.' He had been reaching them down as he spoke, and laid those of Clarence on the table, turning to his own with more than common diligence, though he hardly knew whether they were upside down or not. In a few minutes he was rewarded by seeing his chum settle to work as if by mechanism, yet with an angry frown on his open brow. Mothers might marry, and all the magni ficent castles of boyhood crumble to nothing ness, but there could be no shirking the duties of the school and the hour. Study in some sort brought distraction, and never was Herbert so diligent over his ' swalt ing,' thus leaving his companion less excuse for 'mooning,' and losing his chance of a prize. Then he found an excuse to drag him away from books to a football scrimmage in the Close, 'just to work off the steam, you know,' as he said to his father afterwards. The day wore itself out somehow. Night came. Then, and not until then, when they were alone in their study, to read for first VOL. II. E"], [78, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 66 lessons, or coming examination, or to Avrite home, Herbert took out his sister Octavia's letter, and opened it, without a word of refer ence to the others lying unread in the pocket of his companion. It Avas a well-filled sheet in a bold hand, and went more into detail than the Squire's, but it had been written with the same purpose ; Herbert being charged to promote a recon ciliation between Clarence and his mother, pro vided his intervention was necessary, but on the ground that it would be selfish in Clarence to expect his mother to remain single and solitary in a lonely house all the years he was likely to be away at school and college. And if Mr Bromley was not exactly the person he or her friends might have expected her to marry, he must remember that if it were a child's duty to consult a parent in such matters, it was not obligatory on a mother to consult a son, especially of his years. It was a woman's supreme right to please herself, and not her friends, in so personal a contract as marriage, and Clarence would show his common sense, and his regard for his mother, and consult his own true interests in accepting the irremediable, and making the best of the situation. Any"], [79, "Echoes of Wedding Bells. 67 unwise display of temper on his part might create antagonism between himself and his stepfather, and cause unutterable pain to the gentle mother he loved so truly. ' I'd like Clarence to see this,' he thought as he read, 'but we must wait till he tones down a bit. Hullo! what's this?' as his eyes rested on a postcript, ' Beatrice to be married on the 31st. Hurrah! we shall both be home in time.' Looking up, as he made the announcement, he was pleased to discover that Clarence had his mother's letter spread out on the open lexicon before him, and was reading it with one elbow on the table, his hand shading his eyes, as if from the light. He folded up Octavia's epistle, reached his own books from the shelves, and, with both hands lightly clasped across his face and both elbows on the cloth, began an indistinct gabble that might be diligent construing or \u2014 anything, for as often as not he watched his friend be tween his gaping fingers. Once he thought he heard a tear splash on the paper across the table, and took it for a favourable indication. Did he call Clarence ' soft ' ? Not he. His"], [80, "68 The Slowly Grinding Mills. mental commentary was, ' I should like to give that fellow Bromley a good dressing, that I should!' The mother's tardy letter of pitiful excuse and apology was read and re-read, as if the reader's mind was too disturbed to follow it clearly, or in its rambling incoherence he read more than was expressed. He frowned over the eulogium of her new lord, and regarded with scorn the flag of truce held out in the assurance that Mr Bromley was most anxious to receive her son in a fatherly spirit. Her hopes that they would be the best of friends, raised only a sigh and a dubious smile, pro voking the involuntary exclamation, \u2014 ' Poor mother ! so easily beguiled ! Friends with him ? Never / ' Herbert's ear caught the muttered words, He looked up. ' Have you gone through your own letters ? ' 'No, I have only half read Irene's, and here is another unopened, I fancy comes from Mr Preston. What can he have to say ? ' 'Well, there is one from Octavia, I should like you to run your eye over. It's just like her.' Having subdued his mind to the contem-"], [81, "Echoes of Wedding Bells. 69 plation of his offending mother's communica tion, the others followed seriatim. eH'm,' said he, 'the Rector is like the man in the fable, blows hot and cold with the same breath.' He laid down the last with the remark, ' A rare peal of wedding bells, all set to the same tune. Four exhortations for me to keep cool and take the good \u2014 or evil \u2014 the gods have sent me with becoming meekness. It cuts two ways. Either I must be a con foundedly peppery fellow, or, there is good cause why I should be.' ' Perhaps a little of both,' put in Herbert dryly, but he said not one word about his own father's voice in the general chorus. He sensibly decided that was for his enlightenment only. Prudential considerations would have little weight with Clarence. Octavia's advice would be most likely to reach the young man's heart. He was right. His letter was handed back with the remark, \u2014 ' I wish I had such a sister, Bert. She is just the one to keep a fellow straight. But even she does not hold with my being kept in the dark.' No writing home was done that night, nor the next. . Clarence had to fight down his own"], [82, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 70 passions, his sense of injury, his desire to resent Nicholas Bromley's trickery, and though as yet he had no clear idea that he had been robbed of his birthright, he was not all at once to be won over by the emotional pleadings of Irene, or the calmer reasoning of Octavia. Yet her appeal to his better nature won in the end. The son's reply to the mother was as pacific as was consistent with self-respect ; but what the writing cost him, shallow Mrs Bromley little suspected. ' Rugby School. ' My Dear Mother, \u2014 You have given me a surprise and a shock from which I shall not readily recover. All my old impressions of parental tenderness have been subverted.

Of course you had an absolute right to please yourself in an affair of so much importance ; but I consider that a son has rights and feelings as well as a parent, both of which in my case have been ruthlessly trampled on. Had I been a child of tender years, I could not have been more utterly ignored. ' Whether you have done well or wisely is not for me to say. The future must determine that. I can only add that I am, as I ever have been, \u2014 Your affectionate son, ' Clarence Copeland.'

The words struck home as arrows tipped with truth generally do, and her tears fell plentifully over the pages as she read. ' What are you crying about, my dear ? ' ques tioned Mr Bromley as he struck the top off an egg. ' Put the letter down until you have finished your breakfast, if it distresses you.' ' He says my silence was cruel and unnatural, and \u2014 and I feel as if it was true.

No answer came readily to this. She could only have contradicted him in part, and she had not the courage to venture that. He extended his hand for the letter, across the table. ' Let me see what the hot-headed boy has to say for himself?' He pished and pshawed as he read, but his brow contracted and his nervous fingers sought his buttons. It was not altogether what he had expected, but he read between the lines, and saw the constraint the writer had put upon his pen, and something more. ' Well, my dear,' he was very liberal with en dearing epithets, ' I see nothing here for you to weep over. I think the boy takes it pretty rationally on the whole. He will soon get over his temporary annoyance.

GOING home. The examinations were over. Prizes were ad judged. Both boys had got their remove to the upper fifth, and were consequently jubilant, though a cloud hung over the prospect of ' home for the holidays ' for Clarence. Only a week had elapsed since his receipt of the news which, but for Herbert, would have floored him in his examination, and they were in the midst of the bustling Christmas exodus of the great school, hurrying to meet the early morning train, his rash protest against return ing home having, like many another such hasty determination, come to nothing. Early though it was, the railway station was lighted up, porters and trucks were scurrying hither and thither, the different platforms were alive with boys, big and little, going north, south, east, west ; some so impatiently before hand that they would have to cool their heels"], [88, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 76 on the pavement or stamp about to keep them warm whilst waiting for trains not due ; others rushing hither and thither to secure places for themselves in ' through carriages,' or with Herbert and Clarence looking forward to a change en route ; but with some few exceptions, all eager and expectant, as if disappointment had no place in a boy's world. Clarence Copeland's face was one of the ex ceptions. He looked as if he envied some of the little fellows in their tall hats and warm overcoats, who appeared brimming over with delight. He could not master his repugnance to meeting Nicholas Bromley as a stepfather, although he had, after a sort, acquiesced in the inevitable. ' I say, Duke, cheer up,' cried Herbert, when they were fairly off. ' You can spend the best of your time with us, you know. And if this weather lasts there will be some fine skating on the pond.' ' I shall be certain to do that. The Mater will not want me at her elbow now. And I shall find it intolerable to sit down with that man.' (He did not need to explain who was meant by ' that man.') ' However, if the Squire meets us at Colborough, as he promised, I shall hear exactly how the land lies before me.'"], [89, "Going Home. 77 That was a long, cold ride in spite of rugs and wraps, and after the first hour or so, and the change of trains, the young fellows subsided into silence, rarely broken, except when the door of their carriage was opened, to let pas sengers in or out. They were not surly ; only thought and conversation seemed to freeze as did their breaths on the window-panes, shutting out the prospect, whitened here and there with freshly fallen snow. At the first shriek of the whistle which her alded their approach to Colborough, Clarence hastened to lower the fairy - frosted window nearest him, and, as the train slackened speed, looked out from their elevation on a scene of dazzling beauty. Across a speckled wilderness of chimneys and irregularly-pitched houses, in seeming roofed with slabs of alabaster, could be discerned castle and cathedral, perched on their rocky height, tipped on every tower and pin nacle Avith fleecy tufts that sparkled in the clear, keen atmosphere, through which the wintry sun shot his sharp lances. Then the grey station shut the wondrous vision out, and before he could catch a glimpse of the robust, but not tall, figure pacing the platform, Herbert exclaimed, \u2014"], [90, "78 The Slowly Grinding Mills. ' There he is ! There's the Pater, looking as hearty and jolly as ever. God bless him ! ' They were out on the platform, had the Squire by both hands, and bore him off in triumph to their carriage before there was a chance of more than a casual greeting. A substantial tip to a porter secured them from intrusion ; they were shut in, and then question after question poured thick and fast upon their elder, whose aspect struck Clarence as more grave than ordinary. ' Silence, Bert,' said he, ' your curiosity must wait. My motive for meeting you here con cerned Clarence, not yourself.' He turned to the other, ' I was anxious to ascertain in what spirit you would return to Moorside House, and, if needful, tender my advice, so as to pre vent a rupture.' ' It appears to me, sir,' said Clarence, with a smile, ' that, as I said to Bert, I must be re garded as a very fiery individual, a sort of human gunpowder cask, liable to explode on any provocation, so many have been my friends' admonitions to keep cool.' ' Ay, ay,' interjected the Squire. ' Yes, sir ; and I may confess they were not uncalled for. A very whirlwind of passion"], [91, "Going Home. 79 swept over me, when, unprepared, I was made acquainted with my mother's marriage first from a friend's letter, You will own the provocation was great. But, thanks to Miss Octavia and to Herbert here, there will be no unpleasantness of my seeking. I shall endeavour to stifle my private aversion to Mr Bromley, out of con sideration for my mother, though nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to pommel him within an inch of his life.' ' So I imagined. I have pretty much the same feeling, my boy ; but there are reasons, powerful reasons, why, in your own interest, as well as your mother's, you should keep on good terms with your stepfather. You may not be aware that, under the foolish latitude of your father's will, he becomes virtually the arbiter of your destiny ' \u2014 Clarence started \u2014 ' has unlimited control of Clarence Copeland's estate, real and personal, left so confidingly to the constancy of a \u2014 woman.' There was a touch of sarcasm in the pause before the latter word, supplying as it did the place of a less complimentary epithet.

It kept the deed unsigned for a week or more, but he had to give in, and confess that if it did no good to secure an allow ance for your minority out of our profits, it could do no harm.' The Squire rubbed his hands to gether as if the very reminiscence was satis factory, as he went on, ' The end has justified our forethought. Still ' \u2014 and he once more looked grave, \u2014 ' as your minority only ceases at twenty-three, and your mother is appointed your guardian until then, the absolute provision we made for your education, maintenance, and so on, might pass into, or through the hands of her alter ego!

But should the liberal sum set apart for your use be di verted from its proper purpose, I have power to interpose, and re-adjust the balance.' ' Oh ! ' As the monosyllable fell from his lips, Clarence folded his arms across his chest, and sat with bent brows, lost in thought for some minutes. ' Why have you told me this ? ' he asked at length. ' Not to set a high-spirited boy in rebellion against legally constituted authority, but to warn you against ignorantly resenting the presence of your stepfather too openly, and to show that it will be both more sensible and manly to accept him cheerfully, if he be disposed towards friend liness and cordiality. If otherwise \u2014 but do not let your feelings mislead you, \u2014 and any serious difficulty should arise, to let you know where you can find counsel and support ; but I hope none such may arise.'

Here Herbert, who had hitherto preserved a discreet silence, struck in with a question that was on the tip of the other's tongue. ' I say, Pater, do you think old Brom knew all about the will and the partnership ? ' ' It is difficult to say, Bert. We can only suspect. He knows nothing of the partnership deed, unless he has found it among Mr Cope land's papers. It was not in Sedgwick's hands.' ' Then I hope he won't find it. Hullo ! here we are, and the coal-trucks are mottled like huge magpies. Beatrice might ice thousands of brides' cake off the moor.' Thomas was there in waiting with the phae ton, exchanging confidences with Raine, the Squire's coachman, as in friendship bound, until the whistle and puffing of the advancing engine warned both Jehus to look well to their nervous animals. The modern leviathan had disgorged, refilled, and gone forward, laboriously panting and snort ing before the swinging across of the white gates gave the signal that the line was clear, and the passengers, including our three friends,"], [95, "Going Home. 83 were free to cross, followed by the Stanfield footman, and a porter with the Rugby port manteaux. As they neared their waiting vehicles, it struck Clarence that both the old coachmen touched their hats to him with more of defer ence than he had ever previously observed, as if he had acquired a new and grave interest in the eyes of both retainers. ' Mistress would have come to meet you, sir, but Mr Bromley ' (he did not say ' master ') ' he said as perhaps you'd rather meet her at home, sir,' was the message Thomas delivered, as he helped the porter to haul the big portmanteau to its place on the vehicle. ' Quite the best,' put in the Squire, who overheard, unwilling that Clarence should receive an unfavourable impression at the outset. ' Grown sons do not care to meet emotional mothers on open platforms.' There was a firm grasp of the young fellow's hand that said more than words, a call from Herbert, ' Come over to us before the day's out,' and in another minute the carriage, drawn by a magnificent pair of dappled greys, was rolling noiselessly on over the snowy road in advance of the phaeton."], [96, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 84 The Squire had left Avith Clarence Copeland ample material for reflection. He sat with his arms folded, looking sternly forward into the future, all boyishness taken out of him. He had hitherto seen in Mr Bromley an intruder on the hearth which was as much his own as his mother's, one who had the right to exact obedi ence from her, and who might possibly attempt to coerce himself ; but that he, the heir, should be suddenly dispossessed by the mere act of her marriage, had no place in his saddest dreams. He who had been hailed as ' the young master,' had sunk to a position of dependence on a stranger's honour. It was a situation too ter rible to dwell upon. It made the meeting with this Mr Bromley all the more painful. He half wished the Squire had left him in ignorance. There had been enough in Herbert's letters from home of his sister's marriage settlements. Surely his mother must have had something of the kind. She would not give all up un reservedly. ' Please, Mr Clarence, must we stop at the Rectory, as usual ? ' broke on his medita tions. It had been customary for Mrs Copeland to meet her son, and if Miss Irene did not bear"], [97, "Going Home. 85 her company, to call at the Rectory on the way home. A subdued, ' Not to-day, Thomas,' answered the query, and the young man lapsed into reverie once more. This did not suit Thomas, who fidgeted in his seat. 'There's Miss Irene at her window a-lookino out for us, sir,' he began. Clarence looked up, lifted his hat, bowed, answered her familiar nod with a smile and a wave of the hand, but made no sign of stoppage. 'And there's Miss Sedgwick a-talking to Mrs Pratt at the clerk's door, and they be a-watching of us, sir ; and there's Asaph a-coming up the street as you would hardly know him, sir.' ' Are they ? ' said Clarence, with a languid sigh, as if the interrupton of his thoughts was unwelcome, raising his hat respectfully to salute the stiff spinster in passing, and just throwing a sideway nod towards curtseying Mrs Pratt in her rusty, black-stuff gown. He looked ahead at another figure advancing, and certainly would not have recognised Asaph Pratt, though they had gone on many a plant-hunting excursion together in times gone bye. He was differently dressed, his bones did not hang so loosely"], [98, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 86 together, and every sign of loutishness was gone. He took off his hat as they drove past, but without servility, and was answered back with a look of surprise, ' That Asaph ! ' exclaimed Clarence. ' Ay, sir, that's him, sure enough ! But heigh, Mr Clarence, the changes there has been since you went away ! ' and the old man's tongue set a-going on a new tune was not to be stopped. ' Such changes surely ! There's Asaph a-going to be a doctor an' a-learning hisself Latin ; an' then Lawyer Sedgwick has got a nevvy a-come to be his head clerk, and he's a-going to lodge in them very rooms as Mr Bromley had with Mrs Pratt afore he hung up his hat at Moorside House. An' ah, Mr Clar ence, what would old master say if he could see the changes at Moorside House, and that lawyer's clerk a-sitting in his place an' giving orders ! You know as old master never would dine at quality hours, but now we has dinner at half-past six like other gentlefolk ; as if Mr Bromley had been a topper all his life. Not as it matters to me, but cook grumbles, and says her work's never done, and \u2014 ' ' I think, Thomas, you are letting your tongue"], [99, "Going Home. 87 run on a little too fast. If there be no worse change than that of a dinner-hour we may be well content to take things as we find them. It is not for you to discuss with me the changes made by my mother's husband,' said Clar ence, as if he felt bound to uphold her right of choice, although the free comments of the old servant stung him deeply, and suggested an upheaval of his own world. Thomas was snubbed, and looked it. How chilly was all in Moorside Lane! The noiseless roadway, the frosted tracery in the Stanfield shrubbery, the dark firs in their own wood bending beneath their snowy burden. It was a cold home-coming. The door was open ere the phaeton stopped, but the servants were not ranged in the hall to receive him as of old. Mr Bromley had dis missed them summarily with a lofty muttering of ' Idle ceremony ; and wanting no unnecessary fuss.' Mrs Bromley herself was rushing forward to embrace her son, but a restraining hand was laid upon her shoulder, with the words, ' Calm yourself, my dear, Clarence is not a boy.' Boy or man, in another instant he had his arms around her, and held her in a closer clasp"], [100, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 88 than might have been had he not both seen and heard. Widow or wife, she was his mother ; no sacrilegious hand could untie that bond. ' My dear, dear mother ! ' It was all he said, but there was a mournful cadence in his voice which told of broken hope and latent fear, as well as filial affection. ' My own darling boy, I am so glad you are here,' she said with a half sob. ' I was afraid you might be angry with me,' she added in a lower tone, still clinging to him. Clarence could not say that he was not ; he could but kiss her tenderly in reply. Mr Bromley's ears were sharp ; he took up the words. 'Angry, my dear! Why should he be angry ? You will make him fancy me an ogre, instead of a trusty friend upon the hearth, pre pared to welcome him with open heart and hand.' The young fellow either did not or would not see the extended hand ; he saw the gleaming teeth and the smile that revealed them, and trusted neither. Mr Bromley turned into the morning-room, which overlooked the wintry garden, and left the pair to unfasten wrap and overcoat with"], [101, "Going Home. 89 fingers which impeded each other, and tongues fettered by his proximity. In a few minutes Clarence was seated in his mother's own chair by a blazing fire, whilst she hung over him, and Mr Bromley opened up a general conversation on the Aveather and the journey, as if he had not observed the rejection of his proferred hand. It certainly helped to thaw the atmosphere more than did the fire. It prevented too much dwelling upon the usurpation of a seat the youth held to be his own in natural succession. Presently there was a pause, broken by the inquiry, \u2014 'Where is Negro? He has not come to welcome me. I heard him barking as the car riage stopped.' ' He \u2014 he is in the stable,' stammered Mrs Bromley, from the back of her son's chair, where she stood smoothing his wavy brown hair with tender touch. ' We have been obliged to keep him there he has grown so surly.' ' Poor fellow ! ' said Clarence, with a heavy sigh for commentary. ' Then I must go to him, or he will break his heart.'"], [102, "90 CHAPTER VII. NEW REVELATIONS. Moorside House, tall, square, and double fronted, had been built late in the last century. It stood against the high bank, or moorside, into which it was so welded, that although an ascent of six or seven steps led to its front entrance, the stained-glass door at the extreme end of the hall was raised but a single step from the ornamental garden, which rose in natural terraces one above another to the level of the moor, and of the railway passing rather near. The architect had planned it with true Georgian precision. The three apartments on the right of the entrance had their counterparts on the left. On the former were the dining-room, library, \u2014 with a side window on the look-out for trespassers in the wood \u2014 and a morning room, having a pleasant view of the terraced garden. On the left, drawing-room, butler's pantry, and spacious kitchen, into which the pantry had a second outlet as well as a window commanding the stable yard and all passers to"], [103, "New Revelations. 91 the kitchen-steps. The two floors above differed only in the addition of a dressing-room over a portion of the wide front hall, and in appro priation. Over the drawing-room slept Mrs Bromley, using also the front dressing-room. Her son, when at home, occupied the chamber over the dining-room, and in addition a second, sandwiched as it were, between his bedroom and the guest-chamber behind. This, his old play-room, had undergone many metamorphoses since it was first appropriated to his boyish service. Rocking-horse, kites and tops had long been banished to the servants' floor above, and though bats and cricket balls, skates and boxing gloves, had lodging there, indications of mechanical and scientific leanings, which had their origin in the library underneath, were not wanting. Besides the heterogeneous medley of books, a small case \u2014 apparently home-made \u2014 of fossils, chiefly from the coal formation, a box of tools, one or two incomplete models of machinery, and a small workman's bench under the window were there in evidence ; a window, which by the-bye, commanded pleasant glimpses of a narrow and sinuous wood-path under the firs and larches. It was, however, to visit the stable, not this"], [104, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 92 private retreat of his, that Clarence quitted the warm fireside in the morning-room and took his way across the tiled floor of the busy kitchen to a door opening on a long yard at the side of the house, stopping by the way to exchange greetings with the three disappointed women servants. Coach-house, stable and laundry were situated apart from the dwelling, some twenty yards lower down the lane ; the high bank rising behind as if it had been scarped out to admit and shelter them. The interven ing space, enclosing a pump, served for many domestic uses besides the portion nearest the road, claimed by Thomas for grooming the ponies, and for carriage washing. A pair of large wooden gates shut all this in from the road, a wicket-door in one gate being the ordinary entrance for servants and tradespeople. To the kitchen garden at the far end, on a higher level, access was obtained by five or six stone steps, a similar set leading to the kitchen door. Before Clarence Copeland set foot on these steps he heard Negro barking strangely, and striving, as it were, to beat some barrier down. Thomas was there behind the closed gates, rubbing down one of the ponies, a stable lad"], [105, "New Revelations. 93 employed as helper doing his best with the other, and calling roughly to the dog shut up in the stable, \u2014 ' Lie down, you brute, will you ! ' ' Hout, lad, let the dog bark his hardest. Happen th' young master may mind him if he wouldna listen tome. Heigh, here he comes! We'll see what he thinks o' this for a change.' What he thought was written on his face. He opened the stable door with a jerk, and Negro was emancipated, to leap and fawn upon him with the double delight of welcome and recovered liberty, still barking, but with a difference, as Clarence stroked his black head and patted the wavy coat, now bristling over with a crop of broken straw. ' Poor Negro ! poor dog ! How long has he been imprisoned in the stable, Thomas ? ' ' Ever since the new master came. Negro cannot abide him. The dawg growled and showed his teeth at him, an' I wur ordered to lock him up.' ' Surely a chain to his kennel might suffice,' said the young man in rising heat. ' New master dunno think so,' replied Thomas, gruffly, interrupting the sibilations inseparable from his occupation."], [106, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 94 Clarence said not another word, but out at the wicket he went to keep his temper down in the snowy lane, the good dog bounding and frisking before him, rolling and scraping in the powdery snow till he was half lost in a mist, and wholly lost in grateful devotion. Presently they were recalled to luncheon by the clang of the old dinner-bell over the kitchen door. ' Kennel, good dog,' cried Clarence, and, at a word, with just a wag of the tail, in went the well-trained animal, and lay down quietly, following his master with expressive eyes. Negro was emancipated ; for the time being that was, and under restrictions ; Mr Bromley, apparently desirous to conciliate, regretting that the restraint had been of necessity, and only stipulating that Clarence should be responsible for the dog's good behaviour, and his non intrusion within doors. In some respects the incarceration of Negro was a godsend at that particular juncture. In concern for his favourite, Clarence, who had somewhat cooled himself in his short walk, forgot his private grievances. The dog served as a topic of conversation during luncheon, and paved the way for anecdotal chit-chat, in which Mr Bromley was proficient."], [107, "New Revelations. 95 And so the meal passed without any of the ' awful pauses,' or more unpleasant friction poor Mrs Bromley so much dreaded. Clarence, thinking of Negro only, had taken his seat at the side of the table mechanically, and when, after the cloth was withdrawn, Mr Bromley proposed ' a smoke,' he accepted the proffered calumet of peace without hesitation, and an hour later walked up the lane with Negro racing before him, doubting whether his new stepfather was such a very bad fellow after all. His first opportunity for airing his half-formed opinion was the Manor House. In answer to the query of the Squire, ' Well, what is the verdict ? ' he replied with a bright smile, \u2014 ' The evidence is conflicting, and the judge has not yet summed up. Mr Bromley is more agreeable than was anticipated, and the cigar of fellowship has already been smoked.' ' I am very glad to hear it,' said Miss Octavia. ' It would have been extremely pain ful to your good mother had it been otherwise.' Clarence bowed in acknowledgment. ' Your kind letter put the matter before me in such a light, I could do no other than follow its guidance.'"], [108, "96 The Slowly Grinding Mills. ' Nonsense ! ' interjected the future Lady Spencer. ' I expected you would have dis played more spirit, Clarence. You have quite disappointed me.' ' Don't be absurd, Beatrice,' came in prompt rebuke from white-haired Mrs Stanfield ; ' it requires more real spirit to look the inevitable fearlessly in the face, and accept the situation cheerfully, than to show the haughty front of indignation and rebellion. Any spoiled child can stamp and fret and fume when its plans are crossed ; Clarence has shown his manhood in exercising self-restraint and steering clear of prejudice.' ' At all events, he has shown his common sense,' added the Squire conclusively, and there the subject dropped. Herbert struck in with a remark about the thickness of ice on the pond and anticipations of skating parties if the frost would only last, as seemed probable. 'Ask Irene to join us in the morning,' said he, when Clarence departed, avowedly to proceed to the Rectory, and the latter nodded in reply. The frozen-out gardener Trench stood in his door-way at the lodge smoking a long clay pipe,"], [109, "New Revelations. 97 meditating on the things temporal and spiritual. He touched his cap on the approach of Clarence. ' I hope I see you well, sir.' ' Quite well, Trench. And how is the world using you ? ' ' Middling sir, middling. I don't reckon much on this world's usage, it's th' next I'm more concerned about. But I might ask you that question, sir. It seems as if there was naught but marrying and giving in marriage as in the days of Noah, with never a looking forward to the judgment to come.' ' Well, yes, there does seem a marrying epidemic in the air. But why should you be so gloomy over it ? Surely Miss Stanfield's ap proaching bridal is not suggestive of judgment to come. Is anything wrong with your Nelly ? ' ' Nothing that I know ; still she'd best have kept single, and so might some other folk,' and Trench puffed away vigorously, but of judgments spoke not another word.

And it struck him that although there was a general ' hope that he found all well at home,' only one or two, and these tradesmen standing at their shop doors, had ventured on anything verging on congra tulation. And he fancied the universal face held a sympathetic something that was more of melancholy than rejoicing. Even Mrs Pratt, opening her door to a workman with rolls of wall-paper under his arm, could ejaculate, \u2014 'Goodness days! Mr Copeland, I've been a wondering how you'd get on with your neAv father. Not but what Mr Bromley's a pleasant-spoken man enough, but \u2014 well, you know, it's a change for you, like.

And, my goodness ! what a fuss Miss Sedgwick have made to be sure. Nothing good enough for him But then, to be sure, he's a gentleman, and they pays for it all, even for the new carpets.

Altogether he was less satisfied with that individual than when he left home. The first person he encountered at the Rec tory was beaming and domestic Miss Preston. She was crossing the hall with clean sheets or table-linen on her arm, and could scarcely find a hand for him to shake. 'You will find Irene in the parlour,' said she, after her first hearty greeting. ' I shall be downstairs again directly.' She was not downstiars again for more than half-an-hour, but that did not trouble the young people. Irene had taken her sewing to the old fashioned window-seat for the benefit of the waning light. Down it went on the approach of his footsteps, and with both hands extended she met Clarence half way with a short cry, a flush of pleasure reddening her cheeks. He grasped her hands and held them closely in his own."], [112, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 100 As girl and boy they had been wont to kiss when he came and went, as brother and sister might. For the past year or so \u2014 neither could have told why \u2014 the custom had been aban doned, possibly through some mutual intui tion that they were not of kin, prompted by the natural growth of maidenly reserve and of youthful shyness. That afternoon, as she rushed towards him with frankly offered hands and radiant face, an irresistible impulse came upon him to take more, but instinctive delicacy held him back from claiming his old privilege without warrant. Yet how he longed to feel he had Irene to cling to if his mother was no longer all his. Her warm, soft hands were within his own, her smiling face was uplifted innocently, a world of trust in those deep blue eyes. 'May I?' said he, tentatively, and dreading no repulse, he dropped a kiss upon her rose-leaf cheek as delicately as if she had been a new-born babe. There was nothing of the brother in the kiss. There was nothing of feverish passion in it. Plainer than his words it said, ' You are all I have now, Irene ; love me, dear, and be true to me.' ' I have always loved you, Clarence ; you"], [113, "New Revelations. 101 know I have,' came in answer, with no signs of tumult in maidenly breast or face, but he felt as if his troubled soul had found a safe anchor age, though neither was fully conscious how momentous was the import of what had been asked and answered, or of the second kiss that fell like a red seal upon a bond. He took his seat beside her in the broad window-seat, his arm resting along the ledge behind her shoulders, and kept one of her hands in his, whilst Negro, who had followed closely on his heels, thrust his black muzzle under her other palm, as if seeking to share in her caresses. ' Poor old fellow \u2014 good dog,' said she, stroking his glossy head as calmly as if she had not just made over her whole life to the young fellow at her side. ' Where did you find him ? I heard he had been shut up.' ' Shut up \u2014 yes,' began Clarence, savagely, then abruptly, \u2014 ' Why, Irene, dear, your eyes are swollen as if you had been crying. What has been the matter ? ' The last rays of the frosty afternoon sun had fallen on the face turned up to question him. Down went the head of paly gold, and now the blood rushed hot and crimson to the tips of her delicate ears."], [114, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 102 \u2022 Oh, nothing, nothing now,' she murmured, evasively. ' Nothing now ? ' he echoed. ' Something has been troubling you. What was it, my darling ? I cannot bear to think of my Sunbeam in grief and tears.' There is no school in which students progress so rapidly as that in which Love is usher. His voice had sunk to a low and tender whis per, though there were no eavesdroppers, and his arm slipped from the window-ledge to her waist. ' What was it Irene ? Tell me.' She still stroked Negro's head, but needed some pressing to confess. ' Well \u2014 I \u2014 thought \u2014 that is, I fancied you were offended with \u2014 a \u2014 us, when you drove past to-day without stopping. And I fancied, perhaps, papa had told you in his letter he Avould not allow me to visit at Moorside House any more, and \u2014 and \u2014 I could not help fretting.' ' My love, my love ! ' he exclaimed, regret fully, ' so I was the luckless cause of your tears. If I had only called as usual, your distress might have been spared. But, truth to tell, Irene, I was myself so disturbed by something"], [115, "New Revelations. 103 I had heard that I felt unfit to meet you, and was only anxious to get over the meeting at home.' ' And that ? ' questioned the girl, looking anxiously up into the changing countenance. ' Well, dear, all is tolerably smooth at present. But what does Mr Preston mean by his inter dict on your visiting ? Of all her friends mother would miss her \" Sunbeam \" the most. I must have a talk with your aunt about that. Surely he does not object to my coming here ? ' 'Oh, dear, no!' replied Irene, confidently, just as Miss Preston turned the handle of the door, and came in placidly, followed by a maid with a lighted lamp. There was nothing unusual in their sitting together in the window-seat, and if Irene shaded her eyes from the sudden glare of the lamp, the action was too natural to excite atten tion. Miss Preston would as soon have sus pected her brother, the Rector, of love-making, as those two young people who had loved each other in a friendly way all their lives. And indeed they had loved each other in a brotherly and sisterly way so long, that they slipped into other relations as naturally as they would slip into dinner-dress in another hour or"], [116, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 104 so. There had been no impassioned declara tions, no emotional ecstasies, and they were certainly very young ; but they were as much in earnest and as sure of each other as if they had invoked all the saints in the calendar to ratify their vows."], [117, "105 CHAPTER VIII. NABOTH'S VINEYARD. It was always understood that the Rector was engaged in the elucidation of difficul ties in some ancient work, either in Hebrew or Sanscrit \u2014 which, did not matter a button to the people around him \u2014 and that when in his study he was not to be disturbed for chance callers, since his studies involved much thought and much correspondence with learned societies, of which he styled himself with commendable humility, ' an unworthy member.' Whether he exhausted his fund of patience in burrowing among dead secrets and mysteries, or reserved it for higher themes, he had very little for ordinary chit-chat, or for long-winded, inconsequent old women's tales of domestic trouble and distress, especially when he was interrupted. Consequently he was rarely visible to strangers except at meal-times, or"], [118, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 106 when duty called him abroad, and much of that duty, such as visiting and relieving the sick poor, or catechising the younger school children, had gradually slipped into the more sympathetic hands of Miss Preston and Irene. It Avas not from pride or self-inflation he re served his sociable qualities for his upper-class parishioners, though he was geniality itself amongst his equals, and kept his superior erudition well in the background, but that he was out of touch with the uneducated poor. He could pat a child on the head or give it a penny to heal a bruise, or the price of a broken pitcher to avert maternal wrath, but he could not enter into the child's heart or find words to reach the depths of a poor woman's sorrow when her sick child lay at its last gasp, however much he might feel. He never shrank from his duties in the justice room, and when a brute of a fellow laid heavy hands on wife or children, was as ready as Major Bathurst or Squire Stanfield to deal summarily with the culprit, but the poor creature who strove to conceal her blackened eyes, and to extenuate the culpability of her drunken husband, was beyond his range al together."], [119, "Naboth's Vineyard. 107 He was never known to shut his door or his purse against the genuine plea of poverty or afflction, but the plea must reach him through Miss Preston or someone else, so that, in spite of his comfortably kind counte nance, he always seemed to give from his hand rather than from his heart, partly because he was at a loss for simple words to reach common understanding. He who was a linguist familiar with the dead languages of long-extinct races, deep in the mysteries of their ancient lore, was out of his depth, and knew it, where the fathomless mind of child hood had to be plumbed, or the uncouth ignorance of maturity sounded. Not that he was hard or impenetrable by any means. He was obstinate when thwarted, but, otherwise, could not trust himself in contact with sad cases lest his softer feelings should lead his judgment astray. So it was that unless church matters called him abroad, he principally confined his visits to the educated members of his flock, and that on social occasions, and generally committed to more capable and patient Miss Preston and Irene the care of the sick, sorrowing and aged in Back Lane, and among the rough colliers"], [120, "108 The Slowly Grinding Mills. who had their cottages on the black moor. It would, therefore, have been quite easy for Clarence to visit the Rectory as of old, or to meet Irene when engaged in visiting her ' poor friends,' but that did not suit his ideas of honour and rectitude, unless it could be done openly, now there was a ban on her appear ance at Moorside House. Tea followed the lamp, and naturally Clarence would have remained to partake, but no sooner had the maid retired to ring the tea-bell for her master, who did not generally obey the summons on the instant, than Clarence rose and addressed the elder lady : ' Miss Preston, I am told that the Rector has forbidden Irene's visits to my mother. Do you know \u2014 ' The door opened, and in walked the Rector, rubicund, portly, and with the tread of authority \u2014 admitted, not asserted. ' Ha ! Clarence ; is that you ?

She rejected a brave soldier and a gentleman, and has foisted a common lawyer's clerk on Highfield. She must expect High field to ignore him. But why are you not taking your tea ? ' ' Because,' and the young man's face flushed hotly, ' I am waiting to learn if / am included in your interdict, and am forbidden association with Irene and this household on the same grounds. I visit no house on sufferance, how ever dear may be the inmates.' The heaving of his chest and the dilation of his nostrils told how the proud boy felt the indignity brought upon him. ' You, my dear boy ? Not a bit of it. You had no hand in the scandalous business. Sit"], [122, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 110 down to your tea, and make yourself at home. Irene, cannot you find a biscuit for Negro? ' Negro, once more in good society, proved himself a well-behaved doggie ; suffered the broken bits of biscuit or the lumps of sugar to rest upon his canine proboscis, until, on the given signal, they were tossed into the air and caught adroitly whilst they fell, Irene bestowing upon him the caresses she might not venture to bestow on his master. Clarence, too, was reassured, and ' made him self at home,' although there was something of a difference in the Rector's manner which he could not define or analyse \u2014 a something approximating to patronage, something never present before. He underwent a second catechism on his reception by his new stepfather ; again he was advised to keep on friendly terms with the usurper. ' If Mr Bromley be not accepted by the community at large, it would be most unwise in you to rebel openly, alike on your deluded mother's account and your own. I would not counsel either deceit or abject submission, but as you are not yet eighteen, and he stands in loco parentis until you are twenty-three, I"], [123, "Naboth's Vineyard. 111 would advise you to bow to circumstances, and accept the flag of truce he seems to hold out.

Mr Bromley is smiling at present and shows pleasantly enough his big white teeth, but if ever those teeth seem inclined to bite, there will be war between us to the death.' ' Oh, Clarence, dear, don't talk that way. He may mean well towards you both,' put in Irene, imploringly. ' I would not anticipate evil if I were you,' said Miss Preston. 'The better you feel to wards the man, the better you will find him.' ' May be so,' assented Clarence and the Rector in a breath. Then, to turn the conversation, the former de livered Herbert's message anent the skating, and no one opposing, it was settled that Irene should be ready when he called for her at ten in the morn ing. So after a little cordial hand-shaking he started most reluctantly for the home where he for the first time felt himself a stranger, and was barelyin time to dress for the altered dinner-hour. Ill-breeding nowhere betrays itself so palpably as at the dinner-table, and though Mr Bromley"], [124, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 112 was not guilty of any glaring improprieties, Clarence, critically observant, detected little solecisms where unconscious Mr Bromley im agined himself elaborately polite, and he groaned in spirit as he contemplated the new man so complacently occupying the seat his own father had filled like a gentleman, much in the spirit of Hamlet contrasting the two portraits. Indeed so strongly did the inner thought find expression in his countenance when they re turned to the drawing-room, and his eye in voluntarily travelled from his father's portrait to Mr Bromley, that the latter, smothering an anathema, drew the little chess-table towards the fire and challenged his stepson to play against him, taking care that the young man should be seated with his back to the picture. That first evening passed without unpleasant ness, though with evident restraint on all. Mrs Bromley betrayed her nervous anxiety by her restlessness. She took her seat at the piano, played a few bars of this, a few bars of that, made an attempt to sing and broke down, then she stood over the chess-board watching the players, her ring-hand resting on the back of her son's chair, then she brought out her work-basket, and made a show of tattino- for a"], [125, "Naboth's Vineyard. 113 while, now and then venturing an observation on the game she had been learning so newly. Mr Bromley smiled perpetually, showing his white teeth, and won or lost with equal good humour, but Clarence felt his pronounced cordi ality to be all a sham ; and when they parted for the night, Nicholas Bromley knew that his fatherhood was accepted under protest, and ground those big teeth of his in the conviction that the boy regarded him not only as an inter loper, but as an inferior, and the fact that he had felt his own inferiority in subtle, undefined ways, stung him all the more keenly. In the old time his mother had been wont to accompany Clarence to his room, to stir his fire and see that all was snug and comfortable before giving him her last 'good-night' kiss and benediction. Now she stood hesitating on the threshold, and kissed him timidly whilst her new husband stood looking on, candle in hand, in waiting at their own door across the wide landing. ' I have not been left alone with my mother for five minutes,' declared Clarence in con fidence to Herbert and Irene, whilst he was helping the latter on with her skates, at the edge of the great pond, where Miss Octavia VOL. 11. H"], [126, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 114 was already in full career. ' What is he afraid we should say to each other ? A gentleman of any nurture or feeling would understand that mother and son would have much to talk over after long absence, irrespective of the introduc tion of new relations. I shall not like him any the better for all his politeness if I find the constraint on mother's free speech and move ments is to continue.' ' Hang the fellow ! ' exclaimed Herbert ; ' I knew he was a sneak and a snob ! ' ' Hush, Herbert ! Do not help to set Clar ence against his stepfather,' put in Irene gently. ' Half the constraint he observes may be im aginary, or the result of his own prejudice. He cannot undo the marriage, but he may avoid collision with Mr Bromley, and set his dear mother at ease, by treating him with respect, at least. I am only sorry I am not allowed to visit her. But perhaps my papa may re lent in a little while. He used to be so fond of Mamma Copeland ; he will surely forgive her for marrying beneath her before very long.' ' Ah, Sunbeam, you always look on the bright side! Now come along. See how impatient Negro is.' And away they went skimming across the frozen pond towards Miss Octavia"], [127, "Naboth's Vineyard. 115 and her pet poodle, Snap, blissfully ignorant of the Rector's secret and insuperable objection to the widow's unpopular marriage. Depression, moodiness, ill-humour vanished under the united influence of the exhilarating exercise and delightful companionship, and when Clarence went down the lane homewards, leav ing Irene to dine with the Stanfields, where they had both taken luncheon, he was almost as buoyant as the unfettered dog bounding be fore him, and scattering the frozen snow in his frisky gambols. Isa shadow fell over him as he entered the house, after consigning Negro to his kennel, it was so slight that he took his place at table with less repulsion towards Mr Bromley than had previously been visible through the thin crust of forced politeness. He talked of the thick ness of the ice and of their feats upon it, of the scampering to and fro of Negro and Snap, of the marked improvement in the skill and ap pearance both of Miss Octavia and Irene, and of the grand day they were to have upon the ice, when Miss Stanfield and Sir John Spencer were to join them on the morrow, and finished the evening with a game of chess quite cordially.

' I do not think we shall be home for luncheon, as Ave are going on to the moor, and after that to Colborough. You see, mother, I have not yet congratulated Nelly Saunders and her hus band. I want to examine the condition of my little property, as I promised father to keep it in good repair, and do not like to leave the inspection until after Christmas Day, lest the tenants should imagine I was in a desperate hurry for the rents.' He began buoyantly, but something like a sigh was audible as he named the father lost. ' Your property?' echoed Mr Bromley in amazement tinged with incredulity. 'Yes, my land and cottages.'

It is small enough to be easily overlooked.' There was no intentional sarcasm in the youth's tone, but the involuntary start and quick questioning glance of Mr Bromley im plied more than he would have liked either of his hearers to suspect. ' But you are a minor. You cannot hold real estate.' 'Oh, that is all right. Squire Stanfield knows.' ' Indeed, you are fortunate,' was rejoined, with a smile like a scowl smoothed out. ' Not so fortunate as I might have been had my father lived to carry out his plans,' corrected Clarence, adding, in a different tone, \u2014 ' Oh, mother, I am thinking, as I shall not be able for many years to build the rest of the cottages he planned \u2014 I am thinking it might be well to parcel the land out into plots, and let it at a cheap rate to any of the colliers who have a taste for gardening ?

If he thinks the men will not care to take up the plots on my terms, I may have to fall back on the Squire's proposal for building \u2014 But there is Herbert's whistle to Snap.' And before he could be asked the nature of that proposal, he was in the hall thrusting his arms into his overcoat. ' Upon my word, Anna,' began Mr Bromley as, looking from one of the dining-room win dows, he beheld the two young men arm-in-arm walking briskly down-hill towards railway arch and moor with Negro and Snap in ecstatic attendance \u2014 ' Upon my word ! that son of yours is as independent as if he were his own master.

I have found no deeds relative to lands on that side the railway line.' And he twiddled nervously with his waistcoat buttons as of old in irritation and vexation of spirit. ' Oh, Mr Copeland purchased the copyhold from Squire Stanfield, and then made it over, with all upon it, to Clarence, either by deed of gift, or a trust-deed, or something to make it the boy's own \u2014 something I really don't under stand. Clar Mr Copeland never troubled me with business ! ' Nicholas Bromley tossed off a fresh glass of wine with savage impatience, his big teeth meeting on the brim as if he would have bit a piece out.

Temper had got the better of prudence. He had made himself serenely comfortable under the assurance that all the Copeland pos sessions had become his by the divine right of marriage, and now, like the sharp sting of a blood-sucking mosquito, came the irritating discovery that, unknown to him, an acre or two of barren moorland was owned by the disin herited boy and placed beyond his control. Was it to be a Naboth's vineyard to the newly rich man for evermore ?

Nicholas Bromley's business apparently took him and his assumed coolness to the office where he expected to find Norman Sedgwick occupying the stool he had vacated. To his surprise more than a third of the large outer office had been enclosed within a shoulder-high partition surmounted by a still higher brass rail and curtains designed to screen his old desk and its occupant from casual inquirers, and at the same time admit an ordinary client to private audience through a narrow door in the partition, whilst Jack's desk was removed some five feet away, where the light would still reach him. As he entered, a broad grin overspread the face of the latter worthy, much as if he said, ' What do you think of this, my old bird in fine feathers ? ' A familiar nod prefaced his ' Good morning, Mr Bromley.'"], [134, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 122 Ignoring the flippant salutation of his former junior otherwise than by a momentary contrac tion of his forehead which the other pretty well understood, he inquired with affected dignity, which sat ill upon him there, for Mr Sedgwick. ' Which Mr Sedgwick ? ' asked Jack. ' There are two now.' ' Mr Sedgwick, senior, of course, blockhead ! ' ' Nay, it's not of course. Mr Norman sees all our clients. And I'll thankyou, Mr Bromley, not to call me names. I'm not your under strapper now. I've a gentleman over me who treats me with civility. And if you come here as a client, I'll ihankyou to treat me civilly.' Nicholas Bromley's fingers played nervously with his buttons. To be thus bearded by Jack was beyond endurance. He was not in a mood to take it lightly. ' I desire to see your master,' he said per emptorily, his frown deepening. ' They're both particularly engaged ; but you can wait, or I can tell Mr Norman, or you can come again,' answered Jack, with exasperating nonchalance, as if he had taken a leaf out of the ex-clerk's own book. The ' both ' grated on Mr Bromley's ear, as Jack intended it should. The look of annoy-"], [135, "At the Lawyer's \u2014 and After. 123 ance at the new arrangements had not been lost on the sharp-witted lad. 'Ask how soon Mr Sedgwick will be at liberty to see Mr Bromley,' he demanded, loftily. Jack wrote the message down with provok ing deliberation on a slip of paper, knocked at the baize door, waited until it was sufficiently open to pass in the slip, then returned to his stool. Mr Bromley's curiosity over-mastered him. He had been wont to open the door and look in. ' Really, there might be some important client, or consultation in that room ! ' he ob served, with a sneer. 'Very likely,' responded Jack, with provok ing caution. Mr Bromley no longer belonged to the office. Out came Norman. ' My uncle is most particularly engaged this afternoon, sir. If your business is urgent, possibly I can act as his deputy, or take instructions.' He spoke as to an ordinary client, with polite ness as far removed from familiarity as assump tion. Mr Bromley drew himself up. ' I prefer to see Mr Sedgwick. At what hour will he be at liberty in the morning ?' ' At eleven precisely.'"], [136, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 124 The appointment made, Mr Bromley had no excuse to linger, but he dropped a button on the step as he fidgeted with his garments going out. Jack's cool indifference to his altered position had stung him more than he would own even to himself. He had expected to overawe the youth who had been at his beck and call so long, who had felt the sharpness of his tongue and the weight of his hand, and now his want of proper deference was galling. His curiosity respecting the property claimed by Clarence had to remain unsatisfied until the morrow, but he need not wait so long to learn what client was in consultation with his old governor, he told himself as he crossed the street at an acute angle, and aired his newly acquired importance on the steps of the In stitute as if interested in the few people casually passing up and down, now and then bowing with affable condescension to a respectful salu tation. He kept his eye on those other steps where lay his coat button, and waited until the cutting north-east wind reminded him that there was a window as well as a blazing fire in the reading-room. In less than two minutes he was seated beside the window, with a magazine taken at random from the table, as"], [137, "At the Lawyer's \u2014 and After. 125 a cover for his glances elsewhere ; not that there was anyone present to observe him but an old man poring over a newspaper. Waiting time is slow time. He must have thought so, he consulted the late Mr Copeland's gold repeater so impatiently. ' At last ! ' he muttered under his breath, as Sir John Spencer and Squire Stanfield were seen to leave the lawyer's. ' I might have guessed who it was by the time they've been. Old Sedgwick seems to be making much of that stuck-up nephew of his. He never called me in to a consultation all the years I was there, and I'd bet a fiver I'm as good a lawyer as either of them. Ah, they little suspect how many of their private secrets are hidden under my hat. Some day they may come in useful. Old Theo's illness was a rare godsend to me.' As if the thought was soothing he left the Institute with a peculiar smile under his moustache, and he was still smiling when he returned to Moorside House and shut himself up in the library among his predecessor's papers, to search with more minuteness than heretofore. He had found nothing to satisfy his curiosity when he kept his appointment the next morn-"], [138, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 126 ing, and was ushered by Jack Reid into the private office and the presence of both the Sedgwicks. Disconcerted, but not abashed, he supple mented his ' Good-morning ' with an elaborate attempt at polite familiarity. ' Be seated, sir,' said Norman, with a move ment indicating a chair ; then took his stand by the crowded mantelshelf, as if intending to remain. His uncle had said, 'It's best to have a witness when that crafty old fellow comes on business.' ' Well, sir,' said the old man, curtly cutting short his client's remarks about his health and the weather, ' you will oblige me by stating your business, and as briefly as possible, as you are aware this is a busy time.' Yes, he was aware, and that Avas the proper time for his (ostensible) business, namely, the transfer of certain railway shares and Govern ment stock from Anna Copeland, widow, to her husband, Nicholas Bromley, over the details of which he indulged in no unprofessional cir cumlocution.

' What of the colliery interest ? ' put the other, eagerly, with head bent forward as if repudiating the limit. ' I must refer you to the deed of partnership.' \u2022 I cannot lay my hands upon it,' he admitted, unwarily. ' Neither can I.' The curt reply, so characteristic of his old governor, was like a cold douche to Nicholas. He had searched for that deed so narrowly in his office days, and since, to no purpose, among the Copeland papers in his new home, he had come to the conclusion it must be stowed away at the lawyer's in some private safe of which he knew nothing. ' Do you mean to say that the partnership deed is not lodged with the rest of the Copeland documents in your charge ? ' he asked, some what rudely. ' I have already said it. Mr Bromley's brow contracted, not too pleasantly. ' I hear that my stepson claims some copy hold property on the moor as his own. Is that so?'"], [140, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 128 ' Yes, sir, it is ; legally his own. And I only wish his father had lived to make it better worth the holding.' ' Then I presume it is in trust ?

' If you have not any further instructions to give, or questions to put, relative to your own affairs, Mr Bromley, we had better say good morning. We are due to another client.' Thus bowed out, as he told himself, as if of no more account than the veriest stranger, he had much ado to keep down his fierce anathemas until he was out of hearing ; the silent presence of Norman having proved almost as irritat ing1 as the cool and cautious fencing of old Theobald. He was muttering angrily to him self, and imperilling those buttons of his, as he jostled against Squire Stanfield on the worn doorstep, and was not sufficiently master of himself to take off his hat and apologise. ' Confound the fellow's impudence ! ' cried Theobald Sedgwick, the moment his late clerk's back was turned.

He rose from his seat with out stretched hand and a gleam of frosty sunshine on his face. ' Oh, Squire,' he exclaimed, ' your question is answered.

'Ay, ay,' responded Theobald, rubbing his bony hands over one another in his satisfaction, 'and just keep him in the dark over that bit of copyhold land the boy holds on the moor. He grudges the lad even that. I saw it in his rapacious eyes.' ' You will have no control over moneys paid over to the use of Mrs Bromley,' put in Norman, with a sigh of sad remembrance. ' No, sir, but I can insist on the reservation of the full sum set apart for Clarence. I don't mean to be offensive if I see no cause. But I hear that Bromley, before he married the widow, used unfair means to ferret out of a drunken clerk at our Colborough agent's the average takings of the colliery. He lost the man his situation, and has put us on our guard against himself.

Schoolboys, released for the holidays, went whooping and shouting down break-neck slides, or pelted each other with the hardened snow in rough good-humour. There were girls not back ward to join them, and others, with glowing faces and nimble feet, rushing home to exhibit the prizes they had won. Later in the day there might be an influx of pit lads and lasses, spending their pay in reckless Christmas boxes for sweethearts and kin, and there might be more noise and some rough horseplay, but there could not be more hearty hand-shakes and greet ings as neighbours met and parted. Nicholas Bromley was not in accord with the season. He was more like a schoolboy who had been whipped than one who had gained a prize. Wrapped in self, as with a mantle, he strode along the narrow footpath in high dis pleasure, making way for no one. He was about to round the chapel corner. ' Hallo, Bromley, is that you ?

Well, I've just had half-an-hour with that crabbed old bear, Sedgwick. Answers a civil question as if he growled at a dog. Not likely to make a man feel jolly. But wait till the dog baits the bear,' he muttered between his teeth. ' Pshaw ! Sedgwick means no harm. A lucky fellow like you should meet Christmas with smiles and good-will,' said his interlocutor pleasantly. ' I suppose one need not ask you to share our Christmas fare this year, Mr Bromley ?

Mrs Bromley had been busy as a bee in his absence, with Dinah and the housemaid trans forming the lower rooms into evergreen bowers according to time-honoured custom. She was herself on a step-ladder arranging sprays of laurel over the portrait of her first husband when the second entered. Startled by his footstep she slipped, and but for Dinah's ready hand would have fallen. ' Where is Clarence ? Could not he have done this for you ? ' he asked sharply. ' Oh, he is up the village helping the ladies to decorate the church. He will not be home for luncheon.' ' It appears to me he is very little at home,' he put in. ' Was it always so ?

Dinah understood, but Dinah was not sup posed to hear. ' Then, Anna, dear, I think I will go as far as the church and see what is going on there.' 'Yes, do, Nicholas, they may be glad of a helping hand.' But there had very nearly been an unpleasant scene before he went, for ' Anna, dear,' reminded him that her private purse had run low, and Nicholas appeared loth to refill it. It was a new and unpleasant experience to her, as she said, \u2014 ' I never had to ask for money in Mr Cope land's lifetime, when it was all his, and I think it very hard now when it was all mine.

And when she had given out linen and stores for the week, and began to pack up into parcels, large or small, her several gifts for servants, or for husband and son, adding a kindly written word with each, that first difficulty about money seemed to fetter her pen and take the spon taneity out of her words, especially when she sought to dedicate to Nicholas Bromley a fine opal finger-ring she had bought for him with cash she fondly deemed her own."], [148, "136 CHAPTER IX. THE SEASON' S OFFERINGS. The day of Christmas cards had not yet dawned to make the postman's life a burden. But the Christmas-box institution was too old and too universal to be abandoned. It flourished in various degrees and guises, from the hamper of game, the gem in its velvet-lined case, the volume in cloth of gold, to useful garments for winter wear, or Her Majesty's portrait stamped on gold or silver. Clarence brought home with him that night a brace of fine pheasants Squire Stanfield had shot, but they did not apparently atone to his mother for the hampers of fish and game which did not arrive as usual. And when she, as was her wont on Christmas Eve, after the servants had gone to rest, laid on the kitchen table the parcels containing a shawl for cook, a dress each for Dinah and Mary, a pair of driving gloves and bright silk neckerchief for Thomas,"], [149, "The Seasons Offerings. 137 and for Tim a woollen muffler she had her self knitted, she sighed, ' Ah, me ! ' and ' Ah, me ! ' as if old recollections were too much for her. Morning brought its compensations. At the very foot of the stairs she was met with smiling thanks and bows and curtseyings, and the good old formula of Christmas greeting, and took her seat behind the breakfast urn in quite a little flutter of satisfaction and expectation. If she had been up last overnight, she was not down first in the morning. Clarence and Mr Bromley had been before her, and where her plate should have been lay a large square parcel, neatly tied and addressed, and a smaller one on the top of it. Very much smaller were those on the plates of husband and son, who both appeared to wait expectant until she had unfolded hers. The upper one endorsed ' To my wife, ' naturally came to her hand first. It proved to be a raised morocco case, containing an oval cameo brooch, almost as large as a small tea cup top, as was then the mode. She flushed with pleasure, and said something pretty by way of thanks, passing it on for Clarence also to admire whilst she uncovered"], [150, "138 The Slowly Grinding Mills. his less showy offering. It was one of the new photographic albums. An exclamation of delight broke from her on opening the clasp, for there, before her, was the likeness of her boy, and not he alone, for there too was Irene, and there Miss Preston also. Knowing nothing of the interdict on their visits \u2014 for Clarence had not the heart to tell her \u2014 she could not enter into the spirit of com promise with which they had been sent, and her gratification was so manifest, Mr Bromley began to feel no little jealous. Jealousy was, however, dissipated by the dis covery that only a simple coral scarf-pin awaited Clarence in its little pasteboard box, whilst the lambent-flame of a fine opal finger-ring gleamed up at him from a cleft of regal velvet, in a dainty leather case. It might have fascinated those green-grey eyes of his, he gazed upon it with such rapturous admiration. 'It is a per fect treasure,' he exclaimed. In a moment it Avas transferred to his crooked little finger, where it fed his vanity and smoothed his ruffled feelings like a magician's charm. Never went breakfast more harmoniously after that. He forgot for the time that his costly cameo had seemed of less value than a"], [151, "The Season's Offerings. 139 mere receptacle for photographs ; and estimat ing gifts by their monetary value, he concluded that the mother loved her son less than she loved him, by just so much as the ring ex ceeded the scarf-pin in its cost. He might have thought somewhat differently had he seen his wife later in the day press into the hands of her son just such another case, but old and worn, and heard her say, \u2014 ' Here, Clarence, is your poor, dear father's signet-ring. I was keeping it until you came of age, but one never knows what may happen, and under existing circumstances I think it is best in your own charge. You had perhaps better not wear it until you are older, aud have more right to use the crest. God bless you, my boy ! You are your father's image. I trust you will prove as good a man, and never set that seal on aught less true and honest than he did.' ' I never will, dear mother, so help me God !

The decoration of the ancient church was pretty nearly complete when Mr Bromley had walked in. He had therefore no pretext for offering his services, or loitering, unless to ad mire, which he did, audibly. He took care to keep a corner of a furtive eye on his stepson during his general survey, but although Clar ence and Irene were together, wreathing a pillar with holly and ivy, it was done in so natural a manner, without any of the feminine blushing and giggling he had expected, that he left the church no wiser than when he entered. But it so happened that these two were the last of the decorators to leave the building \u2014 if we except Mrs Pratt, who remained to sweep up the litter of leaves and twigs \u2014 and it also hap pened that when the inner doors swung behind them, they lingered for a moment in the porch.

' You should have kept your gloves on, dar ling,' and he carried the damaged fingers to his lips with quite proprietary composure, the while his other hand stole slyly to the pocket of his"], [153, "The Season's Offerings. 141 waistcoat, and in another moment slipped a simple ring upon her finger. 'There, Sunbeam, is a charm to heal the smarting digits; and bind us closer to each other,' he whispered tenderly. ' Closer ! No ring is needed to do that,' she murmured in reply ; ' but I will wear it for your sake, dear Clarence. It is sweetly pretty.' ' Not half so pretty as yourself, my sweet one,' and yielding to an irresistible impulse, he drew her closer to him, and pressed a hasty kiss upon her lips in the dim shadow of the porch, and in another moment they were walking down the pathway to the gates. Only just in time to escape the curious eyes of Mrs Pratt, who came sweeping down the aisle, ' wondering what kept them two so long in the porch.' That was no glittering diamond, symbol of an engagement pro forma ; the word had never been used, or Irene would have shrunk affrighted from plighting troth without her father's sanction. It was only to her the tightening of a long exist ing bond, one that had grown and strengthened with advancing years.

In fact, she was scarcely yet alive to all it meant to Clarence or to herself. And if her wiser elders saw in it the precur sor to something more, they smiled and saw no cause to interfere. However, no giving of gifts, no church decora tion, no sermon promulgating ' peace on earth, goodwill to men,' could make that a cheerful Christmas Day to the owners of Moorside House, for only the coldest of cold bows met Mrs Bromley's smiling recognition of old friends after service. They lingered long over the luxurious dinner and dessert, but not even the champagne broached in honour of the day could raise the social atmosphere to generous warmth.

Not, however, without [much controversy at the Manor House, which only ceased on the insistence of Herbert, backed by Octavia and the Squire, that Clarence should be invited per sonally.

But he had laid down for himself a line of conduct which should make him a lead ing man and a power in Highfield, in spite of rebuffs, and was not easily disconcerted. With genuine surprise, and tenderness not wholly simulated, he hurried towards her, and exclaiming, \u2014 ' My love, my dear Anna, what is the meaning of this ?

' Hillo, Mater, what's up ? Why, mother dear, what has distressed you so terribly ? ' he cried, flinging himself on his knees before her, in trouble almost as great, to be answered only with an access of tears. With another soothing gesture Mr Bromley spoke for his wife. ' Well, no invitations have come here for the Manor House wedding, and your mother naturally feels herself slighted and aggrieved.'

THE YELLOW POSTER. Never, surely, were church bells in such mad haste to usher in a bridal, as those which smote the frosty air, that December morn, with a sud den clash and clang, startling all the quiet folk of Highfield, and setting the very ponies danc ing impatiently on their roughened shoes in front of Moorside House, whilst their new master completed his elaborate toilet on the doorsteps, then racing uphill, when he had taken his seat and had the reins in his strong hands. ' A pleasant day to you,' cried Clarence, who stood on the footpath for a minute or two, look ing after them. He was himself exhilarated alike by the crisp pine-scented atmosphere and by buoyant anticipations of a festive gathering irradiated by the presence of his own ' Sunbeam,' and did not for one moment expect the day to be other than pleasurable to the pair hastening to meet an early train. Yet, early as it was, the overgrown village,"], [163, "The Yellow Poster. 151 Avhich aspired to be a town, was all astir prepar ing to make holiday. The great gates of the Manor House already stood wide open. Nelly Saunders, in her own wedding dress, chattering to her sister at the Lodge door, turned round with a smiling face to drop a curtsey to Mrs Bromley. She was on her way to help the maids, as she had done daily during the week. It was not, however, until they rounded the chapel corner that they saw how busy the people were, hanging out flags and banners, putting up evergreen arches and garlands \u2014 for which somebody's woods must have suffered ; even the shops, previously smartened up for Christmas, were being re decorated in honour of the occasion. The Institute and the New Inn were to be especially gay with flags and illumination lamps. Their Squire did not have a daughter married every week, neither did baronets often select Highfield Church for their espousals. The ponies were inclined to resent the fuss and the flutter, and kept their new master pretty well occupied. But for all that he could see how the excited tradespeople stared with astonishment, and almost forgot to bow, on"], [164, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 152 seeing them drive past at that hour in ordinary attire, and so could his companions. Then, as if there had been no such thing as a wedding in prospect, a cart containing pack ing-cases was drawn up across the road in front of Jacob Pratt's, Avhere Norman Sedgwick him self stood superintending the disinterment of a rosewood piano from its case by Finch and the the carter, standing amid the ddbris of other cases and hay-bands, with which the rugged sidewalk was littered. Miss Sedgwick, tall and slim, in a work-a-day black stuff dress, stood framed in the open window of the parlour Mr Bromley had occu pied in his clerkship years, watching the men at work with more than common interest. There was barely room for the ponies to pass, or their driver chose to think so. He drew them up, bade Thomas get down to move the obstructive cart-horse, and whilst bowing to Miss Selina, shot a keen glance past her round the renovated room, aided by the window at the farther end. What he saw was little to his satisfaction. He had smiled to think his suc cessor was to be brought to his level, not domesticated with his uncle, when Mrs Pratt one day had favoured him with her information."], [165, "The Yellow Poster. 153 He now looked on a transformation scene ; walls, carpet, curtains, furniture, and a piano ! He touched the ponies up and sent them on with a jerk, barely noticing Mrs Pratt in a new cap and gown helping a man to lay a crimson carpet down from the church gates to the porch, over the stony flags trodden by common feet. But Mrs Bromley saw her, and saw how she threw up her long arms in wondering amaze ment as she caught sight of them, and it told her what the common opinion was. Equal sur prise seemed to greet them at the little station, so that they were not sorry to find themselves at last shut in a first-class carriage whirling away from Highfield's inquisitive eyes. The changes in progress at Mrs Pratt's, ' as if what had been good enough for him was not good enough for his untried successor,' found him matter for conversation, and let off some of his irritation, although he had to be reminded that Norman was Theobald's nephew, not merely his clerk.

Mr Copeland, many years her senior, was neither a sight-seer nor a play goer, so that she looked forward to a day at the historic castle and cathedral, and the wind-up at the theatre, with almost youthful animation. To him, the release from drudgery and servi tude to mastership with money in his pocket to spend in pleasure, without niggardly reserve or calculation, was quite as exhilarating. It was still a new experience. He became somewhat rhapsodical, and in dulged in dramatic quotations, chiefly from Shakespeare. His exuberance had a sudden and mysterious check. They were leaving the railway station on foot, and he was repeating, with a rhetorical flourish, \u2014 ' The play's the thing With which to touch the conscience of \u2014 ' when simultaneously voice and uplifted arm dropped.

I have heard so much of this Madame Arrietta. I should so have liked to see and hear her \u2014 But, goodness, Nicholas, you don't seem well ! What is the matter with you ? You have gone such a strange colour.' He was leaning heavily upon his stick, a gold-headed malacca-cane, once Mr Copeland's, his eyes still fixed upon the poster. Her alarmed tones roused him. ' I \u2014 I \u2014 What were you saying ? Yes, I do feel excessively queer. I must have taken something that disagreed with me ; perhaps, that hare-pie.'

' He drew a deep breath as of relief; a faint tinge of natural colour warmed his ashen skin, but still he shook as if with an ague, though his Avandering wits had come back. A disengaged hackney coach stood at the Railway Inn door. ' My dear,' said he to his troubled wife, ' I really feel too faint to walk. But if you will get inside the coach and wait, I can try the effect of your sensible prescription. It would be a pity to go back home unnecessarily.' He certainly did stand in need of the alcohol, or something \u2014 possibly a few minutes to recover his self-possession, for, without doubt, he had sustained a shock. And either the potency of the spirit, or information received with it, proved restorative, for he professed himself better, and was neither so tremulous nor ghastly as he had been when he took his seat beside his puzzled wife, and instructed the driver of the vehicle to put them down in South Street,"], [169, "The Yellow Poster. 157 where lived Mrs Bromley's bridesmaid, a Miss Power. His simple-minded wife, who had little acquaintance with subterfuge, took in perfect good faith his explanation that he had been for years subject to occasional seizures of the kind, which were said to be bilious. The brandy had certainly been beneficial, but he could not expect to recover all at once. He might be all right after a rest at Miss Power's. He put up the window of the coach, closed his eyes, and lapsed into silence, the kindly little woman at his side laying her hand upon one of his in genuine commiseration. The closed coach, the proposed long rest at her friend's were to her but the natural sequence to an attack of illness so sudden and severe. They meant to him the cowardice of con science afraid of the open street \u2014 a ruse to cover a sham. Let there be no mistake. Nicholas Bromley had had a shock from which he might never wholly recover, but it was mental, not physical. And though morally assured that for the time being his fears were groundless, it was not until Miss Power had fussed over him and discon certed her maid in preparing a special mid-day"], [170, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 158 meal for the interesting invalid, that he ventured in the afternoon to escort the ladies to the castle, and to the little theatre in the evening. The audience was thin, the performance in different. He overheard Mrs Bromley address to Miss Power her regret that they had not gone to Severland to see Madame Arrietta, and he set his teeth viciously on the rising ejaculation, ' That cursed poster again ! It's a blessing she's not here! ' What was Madame Arrietta to him ? Could she be the tiger-cat of whose claws he stood in fear ? At all events that yellow poster had spoiled the pleasure of the day to him, and in a measure to his sympathetic wife. She, however, was taking Miss Power home to spend New Year's week with them, and that was a satisfaction. Being Saturday, the last train was late and crowded. Thomas was cross and tired of waiting for them at the station, ' keeping the pownies standing out in the cow'd.' The church bells were ringing the old year out. In a momentary pause they rounded the star-lit churchyard.

The ponies tossed up their heads and pranced along the street, to the danger of pedestrians who had found double reasons for jollification, and shouted ' A Happy New Year ' to each and everyone they met. And greetings a little more orthodox were exchanged in the phaeton, if subdued by the rattle of the wheels. All this was as it should be. But as they neared Moorside House, Negro began to bark his loudest. Mr Bromley muttered a malediction \u2014 the dog and he were unfriends, Thomas had to get out and hold the ponies. Mr Bromley alighted with customary caution, the hall-door had flown open, he handed out Miss Power, and ushered her up the steps, returning for his wife. Miss Power lingered on the top step. ' Don't wait ! pray go in ! ' cried he to her, and she entered, though with seeming reluct ance. Something between a Avail and a groan burst from man and maids, and was echoed by their mistress. ' The first foot \u2014 and a woman ! ' ' What is the meaning of this ? ' asked Mr Bromley angrily. ' Oh !

In any case he was absent and preoccupied at the supper-table, and it was not until his wife asked in much concern, ' Are you feeling a return of your strange illness, Nicholas?' that he roused himself to his duties as host, and professed interest in Miss Stanfield's con version into Lady Spencer, and the doings of the day at the Manor House, of which Clarence gave an animated account to his mother and Miss Power. It was the first event of the kind at which he had been present, and without doubt the day had been a delightful one to him. His ' Sunbeam ' had been radiant, and although he had fancied once or twice that Norman Sedgwick was unnecessarily attentive, the cloud was but momentary. Oddly enough, Miss Octavia had a like uneasy impression ; whilst old Theobald was ' afraid Norman was neglecting his god child.' Norman Sedgwick, on the contrary, had chafed inwardly at being pressed into the service of pretty Irene Preston when he would have preferred to dance attendance on more VOL.

Her father is much more sensible, and so is Miss Preston. And she herself would be far more at ease with girls of her own age, or even boys such as her friends Mr Herbert or Clarence Copeland. She does not want me at her elbow per petually,' was his private opinion. ' Now, remember, Octavia, Sir John will tolerate no pettifogging lawyer brought into the family,' was the parting shot of the new Lady Spencer to her sister, on her way to the carriage in waiting at the door. ' Be under no apprehension, Beatrice. I shall look higher than Sir John when / marry,' was the proud retort, in which lurked a spice of sarcasm. Her ladyship knew Octavia did not hold Sir John in high esteem, and was not satisfied. But trains will not wait, and the bridegroom was impatient. Of this initial game of cross purposes, in which he played his unsuspected part, Clarence had nothing to tell. It was below the surface. He could but picture a brilliant assembly under"], [175, "The Yellow Poster. 163 a hospitable roof, coloured with incident and anecdote to show how all had interested him. It had interest of another kind for his hear ers. Two of them, at least. The starlight night had ushered in a rainy day, as such nights frequently do, and New Year's Day though it was, Mr Bromley made that and his previous day's illness sufficient excuse for breakfast in bed and absence from church. ' Do not let me interfere with anyone else,' he said ; but his tender-hearted little wife felt it her duty to remain and wait upon him, and Miss Power ' had not come prepared for bad weather,' so Clarence, who 'cared nothing for a few drops of rain,' trudged off to church under an umbrella, declining to take either Thomas or the ponies out in txie rain. ' I think, mother,' said he, ' the sooner you get a brougham the better. The phaeton is but a fair-weather vehicle.' ' Yes, Clarence, but I cannot do exactly as I like now, and Mr Bromley may not care to spend the money.' ' Hang Mr Bromley ! ' rose very closely to her son's lips. He only said, \u2014"], [176, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 164 ' Well you will have the colliery profits very soon, and can use them.' Respecting those same profits a little en lightenment was in store for them all. Mr Bromley's morning in bed was a mere ruse to free himself from the strain of playing a part. He had lain awake all night, conscious that his wife for some unknown cause was sleepless also. ' Could that silly \" first foot \" business be troubling her, or her exclusion from her young friend's wedding?' he asked himself. But somehow the superstition he ridiculed seemed to have got a firm grip of him, coupled with the conspicuous name on the yellow poster. ' God forbid that unlucky \" first foot\" should presage a more unlucky second on this thres hold ! ' was his unuttered aspiration, the cold dew of mental agony breaking out at every pore. What would he not have given to fling his arms about and cry aloud ? But he was constrained to lie still and feign repose. It was not until he was left to himself that he could weigh chances and possibilities, rid himself of the incubus of fear, and congratulate himself on the success he had achieved, success, notwithstanding temporary drawbacks."], [177, "The Yellow Poster. 165 ' Nay,' he said to himself at last, ' a moneyed man can do anything. I am master of the situation.

Society shall recognise me ere long.' With that, forgetful of his damaged hip, he leapt from bed exclaiming, ' Richard's himself again !

But he went downstairs prepared to be amiable and entertaining in spite of painful twinges. He had twinges of a different kind when Tuesday morning brought for Mrs Bromley a clerkly notification that the books of the colliery had been made up to the end of the year, and that, as usual, the attendance of her self and son was requested at the manager's office for the audit and settlement of accounts.

And if there be a seamy side to a man's character, at some time or other it must be revealed to his wife. We have seen that Mr Bromley had resolved to compel respect, and, in furtherance of his views, to pose as an attached husband, well disposed towards his stepson, servants and tenants. So far he had only partially succeeded. He had shown a very fair front to Clarence, and the young fellow said he was ' not so bad as he had anticipated.' The women servants wavered in opinion, arguing that ' a master was sure to make a difference in the house, and he might have been worse.

The former had not forgotten the sharp, imperious tone of his, ' Quicken your movements, there ' that first Sunday he had driven them home from church. He knew it as an outburst from the natural man. Strangely enough, that same harsh command to her faithful old servant, coupled with his impatient interruption of her few affable words to Nelly and Ben Saunders, vibrated as un pleasantly on the ear of Mrs Bromley, and, combined with his suspicious hurry to have her banking account transferred to himself, and his manner of shifting to her shoulders the onus of the secrecy observed towards her son, gave the nervous woman some uneasy qualms. All along he had played upon her timidity ; now he seemed to hold her mind in thrall ; yet, though she could not have given a reason, she uncon sciously dreaded to rouse a something lurking under his beard and heavy moustache, a some thing he could not keep out of his voice, and greenish-grey eyes, at all times and seasons. It was faintly perceptible in the constrained tone in which he asked, \u2014 ' Is that the customary notification you"], [180, "168 The Slowly Grinding Mills. receive from the colliery ? ' and in the abrupt rejoinder to her hesitating affirmative. ' Then I think they might have had the civility to address it to me in this instance. It is my affair now.

' She raised her eyelids. ' I \u2014 I never heard of any.' ' No matter, my dear, I shall accompany you to-morrow, to put things on a proper footing. I daresay Miss Power can amuse herself with a book in our absence.' Surely if there had been any secret drawer in the whole library he must have found it before then. He had pushed and pulled whatever his ingenuity could suggest ; and back he went for another overhauling. It was not a very agreeable day for a walk across the black moorland among heaps of slag and cinders, coal and trucks, for, though the rain had melted the snow before it ceased, the ground was still wet and slushy ; and though there was a cart-horse track passing under the railway bridge, from Moorside Lane to the colliery,"], [181, "Within the Mill. 169 it was not in a condition for carriages or valu able horses. Mrs Bromley was putting on a pair of goloshes. Clarence had tucked his trousers into his high boots. 'You surely are not thinking of walking across the moor a day like this?' cried Mr Bromley, in surprise. 1 Why not ? we always do. It's too rough a road for the ponies or phaeton.

' We cannot have that brute at our heels if we are going on business,' broke sharply from Mr Bromley. Clarence loved his dog. His cheeks flushed angrily, his nostrils dilated, his eyes were afire. Another moment and he would have retorted in hot haste. A supplicat-"], [182, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 170 ing glance from his mother curbed his proud spirit. He stooped, patted Negro's head, said, \u2014 ' Good dog, good dog ; not to-day. Back to kennel,' and after one wistful look, the obedient animal went back, his drooping tail and head proclaiming his disappointment. ' Poor Negro,' murmured Clarence, and after that not much more was said for some time. ' Saunders has got his garden in capital trim, considering his short tenancy and the time of the year he entered,' remarked Clarence to his mother as they neared the Copeland Cottages. ' Don't you remember I told you that Trench turned it over, and put in what he could for their use ? Ben has only had to keep it in order. But you should see how neat and clean Nelly has everything indoors,' replied his mother. ' I have seen,' he said, ' and I fancy she and Mrs Gill are striving which shall have the brightest furniture and windows. You see they are pretty well away from the black colliery dust, except in high winds, and are not short of water.' Rosy-cheeked Nelly, her face all smiles, and her hands all flour, appeared at the door,"], [183, "Within the Mill. 171 and dropped a respectful curtsey in salutation as they passed. It was Mr Bromley's first acquaintance with the spot, and he lost nothing his eye could take in, either of the two well-built dwellings, the partially-raised walls of the second pair, or the ground walled in for the contemplated lot. A sarcastic smile flitted across his face as he thought how poor a bit of property it was for the boy to call his own. Not much more than would keep him in cricketing suits.

The rejoinder was prompt and cool, \u2014 ' You were not asked to bring the lady, sir. Her son was a sufficient escort. And as you object to the place in which our money is made and our accounts balanced, permit me to say your presence is not a necessity.' ' Pardon me, sir,' replied Mr Bromley, draw ing himself up stiffly, ' you forget that this lady is now my wife, and that her business has be come mine.' ' I forget nothing, sir, certainly not that.

His face flushed, then turned a sickly white, and the fingers of his left hand went nervously to his buttons. ' In that case, sir, I stand in loco parentis to her son, and joint guardian with my wife,' he urged resolutely, though conscious he was fight ing in the dark. Clarence, standing by his mother's chair, had said never a word. ' You must have given the deed of partner ship but a cursory glance, or a man of your legal experience could never have overlooked the clause providing for the contingency of a second marriage,' suggested the Squire in a business tone, with the addendum, ' since, by it, I am empowered to watch over the interests of my late partner's son.' Mr Bromley had pulled himself together. He would not accept defeat. It was not easy to keep under control his baffled rage, but he could generally master himself in his own interest. In his oiliest manner he admitted, \u2014 ' I certainly did not give the deed the careful"], [186, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 174 scrutiny its importance demanded. Perhaps you will oblige me with a sight of your duplicate, and point to the clause you name.' ' I do not keep such documents in this office, and must refer you to the one you will have found among my late partner's papers.' Nicholas was caught in his own trap. He had implied possession of the document, and lost the chance truth might have given. Dis appointed and checkmated, he could with difficulty keep his rage under cover of his beard and moustache, good actor though he was. It was like pouring vitriol on a wound for the Squire to add, as he did, to Mrs Bromley, most graciously, \u2014 ' And without any sinister motive or reflection on any person, let me at this stage suggest, that as you, my old friend, have changed your state, you should give that partnership deed in charge to Theobald Sedgwick, or some other solicitor, for safe-keeping, until the time comes for its delivery to your son Clarence.' ' I \u2014 I don't know where it is,' she stammered out simply. She might have admitted more but for the sudden contraction of her husband's brows. ' Mr Bromley will no doubt find it for you,"], [187, "Within the Mill. 175 since it is useless to him. But to business. I hear our manager's feet shuffling impatiently in the outer office.' He touched a gong. Mr Kirk, the manager, appeared at the summons. A couple of large account books lay already open on a sloping wooden desk affixed to the wall under a wide small-paned window for the benefit of such light as smoke and dust allowed it to supply. It was certainly not an inviting place for fastidious people in dainty garments. No matter how often the windows were polished, the floors scrubbed, the walls whitewashed, or a duster called into requisition, a fine black im palpable dust, with a slight flavouring of soot from the engine-house chimney, found its way through every chink and cranny, and set its trademark on all things. Thanks to the grand Christmas paint-up and freshening, and to the previous day's rain, the visitors had the best of it. There was less coal-dust in the air, and the warmth of the huge fire blazing in the grate seemed to diffuse itself over the humble place like a friendly greeting.

The Squire was the coolest person present. ' Sir, our books are open to be audited by any properly qualified legal adviser or accountant on behalf of my partner, Clarence Copeland, or his natural guardian. But I deny your right to interfere. Your presence here is an intrusion. And unless you retire, the books will be closed and payments deferred until they can be pro fessionally audited.' The word ' payments ' struck a fresh chord in Mr Bromley's busy brain. ' No one could keep his wife's money from him, why then should he bother about the partnership ? ' 'Well, sir,' said he, with a show of injured dignity contradicted by the twiddling fingers at his button-holes, ' I will on this occasion yield, not having fairly ascertained my rights.

He did not trouble him- self about any black business he had engaged in for less legitimate ends. He only chafed and fumed to think that he had ' been done out of the partnership ' \u2014 that in less than five short years he would cease to have any interest where he had counted on a rich income for life. It was galling \u2014 galling to be so taken in ! Oh, if he could but have discovered that missing deed ! If he had only 'begun at the books,' as lynx eyed Theobald had suggested, he might at least have spared himself that day's humiliation. He wandered about biting at the glove over the back of his thumb-nail ; so lost in thought he walked heedlessly into danger, and was shouted to more than once to get out of the way of laden trucks in motion on the tram-lines. Indeed, so absorbed was the mortified schemer in the contemplation of his disastrous loss of partnership and prestige both, that his ordinary self-possession might have forsaken him also. He was effectually roused from his evil dreams by a sudden clutch at his collar from be"], [191, "Within the Mill. 179 hind, which dragged him backwards like a child. At the same moment a rough voice shouted in his ear, \u2014 ' Nawe then, mon ! Dost a' want goo te awd Clootie headlang ? ' The words were still in his ears, the grasp upon his collar, when his startled glance showed how perilously near yawned the open pit-mouth, and that he owed his life to the prompt action of a nondescript amazon, with white teeth, a smutty face, and a black coal-basket tucked under one sinewy arm. She gave him a shake before she let him go, and as if he had been a child, cried derisively, \u2014 ' Nawe hinny, gang thee hoam te thi mammy, an' bid her tak better care on her fuil bairn.' That he had been a fool he admitted to him self, but he was in no mood to be jeered at even by the banks-woman who had saved his life. Without a word of thanks he thrust his hand into his pocket for coin to repay the service. The woman's lip curled. ' Hout, lad, keep thi brass te buy candy te sweeten thi looks.' And she turned away to her work in open contempt."], [192, "180 The Slowly Grinding Mills. Mrs Bromley and Clarence were leaving the office as he drew near. A very different scene had taken place there. The altercation had previously unnerved peace-loving Mrs Bromley. She sank into her chair all in a tremor. In the very kindest manner, Mr Stanfield pressed upon her a glass of wine to revive her. ' I am sorry you should have been compelled to witness so unpleasant a scene,' he said, ' but Mr Bromley left me no alternative save to maintain my rights and those of your son ; whether his presence here was due to ignorance or intention, I only hope it may lead to no un quietness under your own roof.' ' I hope so too,' she murmured, dubiously. ' Don't be alarmed mother, you will have me by your side if Mr Bromley loses temper over his disappointment. Yet I scarcely think he will,' said Clarence, with determination. ' And don't you be hasty, my boy. Married people settle their differences best by them selves. A few hot words from you now, may kindle a fire you may not be at hand to quench. And now to the books, if your mother feels strong enough.' She rose, went to the desk, and into the"], [193, "Within the Mill. 181 accounts, though, it must be admitted, with less perception than of old. When the books had been gone into, a written statement was handed to her, and Mr Stanfield pointed out that the charge on her profits for Clarence he had made a separate item, as necessitated by her marriage. ' I shall therefore now, and in the future, hand over cheques both to yourself and to your son, for his individual purposes, education, and so forth. I am empowered to do so, and it may prevent future disputation, since, whether you may know it or not, your husband can claim all moneys paid to you, and for your own use.' Mrs Bromley thanked him with a heavy sigh. She did know it then, if she had married in ignorance. ' Now, Clarence, remember what I told you about that cheque. Bank it immediately, and draw upon it with prudence. If you overrun your allowance, you cannot depend on your step father for a shilling. And for your mother's sake, keep your blood cool,' were the parting words of the Squire as he shook hands with them at the outer doorway, after promising to deliver sundry friendly messages to his wife and daughters."], [194, "182 CHAPTER XII. 'A DEAD SWINDLE.' Mr Bromley had not overcome his irritation. A child's castle of cards may be rebuilt after a collapse. There was no rebuilding the black castle of coals which had come tumbling about his ears. He had no thanks for his recent deliverance. In the overthrow of his expecta tions, gratitude had been killed. The woman's mockery sounded like an echo of the Squire's outrageous insults. All else he had gained by his marriage seemed to sink into insignificance before the lost partnership. ' I have risked so much to achieve so little,' he kept repeating to himself. ' Can that cursed \" first foot \" be trampling on me already ? ' ' This is a beastly place to bring a man to ! ' was his first salutation to his wife and stepson. ' I've had more than one narrow escape between coal-trucks and pit shaft.' ' Ah, dear ! you don't mean it ? ' cried tender Mrs Bromley, in dismay."], [195, "'A Dead Swindle! 183 ' Not a nice place for strangers, perhaps,' admitted Clarence, ' but if they keep their eyes open and are careful, there is not much danger in the daylight. There is more danger in the streets of London.' ' To a novice,' sneered Bromley. ' \" 'Tis use doth breed a habit in a man.\" ' 'Just so,' assented Clarence, quietly, in reply, still keeping abreast of his mother. After a pause the former broke forth again. ' I think, Anna, you might have spared me the indignity I have been subjected to this day. If you had only told me the conditions of your share in the colliery, I might have come pre \u2014 ' ' I thought you did know,' she put in, sur prised ; ' you had the keys to papers and every thing, and as you never asked me any questions I took for granted you knew all our affairs, being Mr Sedgwick's clerk.' His response was evasive. ' The deed was not drawn up during my management.' He did not say clerkship. ' I thought you told the Squire you had it ? ' fell from Clarence, as if ruminating. Ignoring the observation, his stepfather turned upon him with lofty assumption, \u2014"], [196, "The Slowly Grinding A/ills. 184 'And pray, young sir, how long have you considered yourself a partner in this concern ? ' Clarence was quick in response. ' From the date of my own father's death un til my mother's re-marriage, I was the recog nised heir to all his possessions. When you, Mr Bromley, unexpectedly stepped into my noble father's shoes, I was at once reminded by my good friend, Squire Stanfield, that whatever else I had lost, at least the colliery partnership was secured to me, and could not be alienated. And now, sir, if you please, we will drop this unpleas ant subject, for my mother's sake. As you now know my position, and I think I know yours, there is no more to be said on either side.' He spoke with dignity, but had evidently held his tongue in a restraining leash. Before Mr Bromley, disconcerted by the word think, could frame a reply, Clarence, to avoid further con troversy, lifted his hat, said, \u2014 ' Excuse me hurrying on, I have a call to make, and shall be late for the Rectory luncheon,' and was off at a swinging pace over the broken moorland, leaving them to follow by the beaten track. If the suppressed force in the speech of Clarence had impressed his stepfather as much"], [197, "' A Dead Swindle! 185 as its moderation or its cogency, that involun tary act of courtesy towards his mother had a much more marked effect. Regarded as an act of deference towards himself, it soothed his ruffled feelings, much as a polished smoothing iron will take the rough creases out of a gar ment. ' I am glad to see your son has some respect for his elders,' he remarked, after a pause, in a conciliatory tone, thus changing the topic of con versation, and setting the agitated little Avoman more at ease. Indeed, he talked of anything but that which lay nearest his heart just then. He was all the while on thorns to ascertain what sum the share in the colliery represented, and to make all he could his own, yet he did not wish to appear too eager. At the gates of Moorside House he paused. He saw muddy footprints on the steps. Clar ence had apparently gone in to change his boots. ' My dear,' said he insinuatingly, ' had I not better take that cheque to the bank at once? I can be back before luncheon.' ' Why are you in such haste ?

Thank you, dear,' a flourish of his hat to Miss Power at the window and his wife at the gate, and he posted uphill with unusual celerity, his long strides carry ing him quickly over the ground in spite of his bending knees and tendency to limp. A broad smile of self-gratulation lit up his face as he went. He had struck a richer mine than he anticipated. He had reached the slight bend of the road be yond the pine-wood, when, like a thunder-cloud across the sun, a sudden frown obscured the smile ; he gave an impatient stamp of exaspera tion on the ground, and between his set teeth snarled out, \u2014 ' For merely five years ! Yah ! I call it a dead swindle ! ' The forgetful stamp caused an involuntary motion of his left hand to his hip, a spasmodic contraction of pain on lips and brow, and an up ward jerk of his head. It was the act of a moment. But it brought before his eyes be yond the end of the lane an uninviting building, inscribed above its doorway, Police Office, and though he had seen it hundreds of times before he stood stock still, and his lips grew white under their coffee-coloured screen."], [199, "' A Dead Swindle! 187 What was its suggestiveness at that juncture to him ? It was a common grey stone erection of two floors only, but it contained the Highfield Justice-room, accommodation for two resident policemen, and in the rear a strongly-barred lock-up, presenting a blank wall to a narrow by-road. This was known as the Waterway, from its proximity to the leaping and sparkling beck, along the grassy banks of which it held its course, tree-shadowed here and there ; offer ing an inviting walk in summer time to youth ful lovers, or weary tradesmen and their wives, who passed the dark edifice representing law and order, with almost as much respect as the newer and smaller stone-fronted bank at the other corner, which testified to the rising pros perity of Highfield. This latter, which confronted the Wesleyan Chapel, was simply a branch of the old Col borough Bank, recently opened for the con venience of local depositors ; and beyond an ornamental panel over the Church Street entrance, bearing the terse legend ' Bank,' had no architectural pretensions whatever. The site had been well chosen, as Theobald Sedg wick said, for although the door of the police"], [200, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 188 office was really in that continuation of Church Street, called Bridge End, it was so close to the corner that the officer on duty might be said to keep guard over the bank, as well as watch and ward over the tippling loungers in front of the ' Stanfield Arms ' across the way, and any ' sus picious characters' loitering in Moorside Lane. It was thus that, although he had the police office full in view, it was not until he had limped as far as the chapel corner that Nicholas Brom ley had the more agreeable prospect of the bank before him. And as at that moment Negro sat on the step placidly as a painter's model, and started into sudden activity to greet, not him, but the fresh- looking, brisk young fel low who came forth pocketing a bank-book, the prospect lost some of its pleasure. ' Um ; so that's where he had to call,' watch ing the pair up the street before he began to cross. ' He must have a tidy sum for an allow ance if he can keep a private banking account, a lad of his age, too !

He handed his wise's very much larger cheque over to the bank clerk for addition to his own personal account with something less than his ordinary self-possession. He had bounded uphill like an inflated india-rubber ball. He went back richer by many hundred pounds, but like the same ball after an unlucky prod with a sharp pin. Miss Power rallied him on his silence and low spirits, which he ascribed to the pain of an un lucky wrench his hip had sustained in avoiding a loaded coal truck at the colliery. If it was not wholly true, it served his purpose, and perhaps the wine he took over his luncheon served his purpose too ; for shortly afterwards, as if moved by a sudden inspiration, he said, \u2014 ' Oh, Anna, dear, had I not better look over that balance sheet, to see if it is correct ? ' And no sooner was it handed over to him than he retired to the library, advising the ladies to go for a drive. Mrs Bromley, feeling much like a schoolgirl released from supervision, took the hint gladly, and he secured an afternoon to himself and \u2014 calculation."], [202, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 190 The altercation on settlement day at the colliery soon got wind, with variations and ad ditions. The door between the inner and outer offices had not been closed until the intruder was shown out. The booking-clerk and paying clerk had their ears open, and did not keep their months shut. From them it went to the weigh ing-clerk, and some way it reached Mr Bromley's friend, Armstrong the viewer, along with the banks-woman's version of her rescue of ' a big bairn gan astray fro his mammy.' Squire Stanfield detailed the occurrences to his wife over the luncheon table, as a proof of 'that sneaking Bromley's insolence,' adding his conviction that the fellow had never seen the partnership deed, and had married Copeland's simple-minded widow under the impression that he could step in on an equality with the Squire himself. ' But do you know, Caroline,' he added, ' I do believe the poor little woman is half-afraid of him. I thought she would faint when I turned round upon him.' 'Then,' said Octavia, with decision, 'what ever society may think or say, I shall call upon her\u2014 if only to preserve her from lying in the dust at that man's feet.'"], [203, "' A Dead Swindle! 191 ' But, Octavia, my dear,' interposed Mrs Stan field, in some trepidation, ' suppose that dread ful man should come here with his wife to return your call ? We could never tolerate his visits here. What would Lady Spencer say ? ' ' More than / should tolerate, no doubt. Let Lady Spencer control her own affairs ; she shall not regulate mine. And if Mr Bromley cannot discriminate between the visit of an unmarried girl to the friend of her childhood, and a visit avoided by that girl's mother, I shall enlighten his intelligence in regard to social laws.' ' Bravo, Octavia! ' cried Herbert, in admira tion. 'You're a regular brick ! I'll back you for keeping the interloper in his place.' ' Yes, my dears ; but Octavia is so outspoken, if she did not compromise us, she might make mischief between Anna and her new husband.' ' I think, Caroline, you may safely leave Octavia to her own discretion. That fellow has had a lesson he will not forget in a hurry, and I really do feel as if the poor woman had found out her mistake already.' This, from the Squire, was a climax. There was no more to be said. A little more reticent was Clarence at the Rectory."], [204, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 192 He had been detained, he said, by unpleasant ness between the Squire and his stepfather, over the partnership rights ; but he entered into no particulars. It sufficed, however, to set the Rector off on ' the folly of a woman in Mrs Copeland's position stooping to marry a designing schemer of a clerk earning thirty shillings a week ; ' and it served to send him off to the Manor House to talk it over with the Squire. It so chanced that almost at his own gates he encountered Mrs Bromley driving her pony phaeton, with Miss Power by her side. A very red face, and the stiffest of stiff bows, were the only recognition he had for the old friend he had privately decided was to be Mrs Preston number two. He had barely recovered his equanimity, when he came across the Squire on Sedgwick's steps, and, after a hearty hand-shake, in they went together. They found the place all in an upset and a pother of dust ; the outer office crowded up with deed-boxes, books and papers, tied to gether with green ferret, or dirty pink tapes, and Theobald sitting among his disordered be longings like Marius among the ruins of Carth-"], [205, "' A Dead Swindle! 193 age.

' Heydey ! what upheaval is this ? \u2014 Mr Norman's doing, : I suppose ! ' cried the Squire in astonishment, as the friends came upon the scene. ' New men, new ways.

' Well, but I don't see \u2014 ' began the Rector, blankly. ' Don't you ? I think the Squire does,' said Theobald, with a queer cock of his head on one side. ' Why, the audacious fellow had the im pudence to cover his unwarrantable poking and prying into office secrets with the excuse that he had \"taken the liberty to remove dust\" which, to his \" newer ideas, indicated decay as well as antiquity.\" ' ' Like his assurance !

I am not often so incautious ; but he was there when the draft turned up,' said Theobald, leading the way across the hall for more discreet confidence. A few days later, when Nicholas Bromley was in the village collecting his own rents, he encountered Jack in Back Lane. ' So your master is having the office painted at last? \u2014 and not before it was wanted,' he said to the youth, with a sneer. ' Ay, we're having a regular turn-out, and no mistake ; and ' \u2014 slyly \u2014 ' we've come across something you was seeking for. You should have begun at the books, Mr Bromley, as master told you.' So saying, Jack passed on, with a knowing wink and a broad grin on his countenance, leaving his late senior standing stupefied, and cursing his own ill-luck. But he said nothing of 'dead swindles.'"], [209, "197 CHAPTER XIII. AT THE INSTITUTE. If Mrs Copeland's complaint that she saw little of her son during his holidays had small founda tion, there was some excuse for Mrs Bromley had she murmured, Clarence Avas rarely at home, he was welcomed where she no longer had a footing ; the young people who had en livened Moorside House at all times, especially when he was at home, had not shown a face there since she had eschewed widowhood and given offence to her friends. Formerly Herbert would have spent hours with Clarence in his private sanctum over the library, but he did not care to enter the house which had the ex-clerk for master, strongly as he had applauded Octavia's resolve to stand by her old friend. Consequently, on the principle which sent Mahomet to the mountain, Clarence went from home to enjoy the society of his own set. Hitherto he had driven his mother round the country making calls here and there, fre quently with Irene for a third."], [210, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 198 Now, he argued, that his mother had put the reins into the hands of Mr Bromley, and he could not ask Irene to share the back seat with him, the case was altered, and he was free to go his own ways and with his own companions ; whether he made a fourth in the Stanfield car riage, or went with the Squire and Herbert for a day's rabbit shooting ; or carried Irene's basket when she had a long walk to comfort some poor soul \u2014 and body. Still, he generally dined at home, and, during the stay of Miss Power, was ready to take a hand at whist when called upon ; the chubby spinster having an idea that, like the Roman Emperor, she had 'lost a day,' when no quiet rubber gave zest to its closing hours. Did not Colborough society depend on the mild excite ment of its tea and whist parties to preserve it from stagnation during the long evenings of win ter ? And was not Highfield, with a little music thrown in, pretty much in the same category. True there was the Mechanic's Institute, with its Wednesday evening lectures and entertain ments, the principle of which were gratuitously given. But the upper stratum of Highfield society only patronised the Institute, whether as donors, or auditors on special occasions. It"], [211, "At the Institute. 199 was ostensibly devoted to the elevation and education of the lower strata, from the trades people to the artizans and pitmen. Certainly it fulfilled its mission, if the demands on the grow ing library, and the attendance on lectures, on the mutual improvement class, and the class for music and singing (over which Jacob Pratt pre sided) could be taken as guarantees. From his first arrival in the village Nicholas Bromley had been a member of the new institu- tion, had taken an active part in its manage- ment, and given occasional ' Readings from the Poets and Dramatists,' with considerable elocu- tionary ability. It was this which had caused his intimacy with Mr Armstrong, who, besides acting as honorary secretary, had given more than one practical lecture on ' Mines and Min- ing.' Of course the former had been on familiar terms with most of the committee, in the days of his clerkship, but having married money and Clarence Copeland's widow, he felt that he must reconsider his position, and not make him self too cheap. It so happened that as a New Year's treat to the younger members of the community, for the Wednesday, so inauspicious to Mr Bromley, a professional lecturer had been engaged to dis-"], [212, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 200 course on ' British Valour,' and to illustrate the same by dissolving views of scenes and incidents drawn from the then recent Crimean War. And as one of the heroes of the Alma, Major Bathurst had been invited to preside. Smarting from his overwhelming disappoint ment, which his study of the balance sheet had not tended to alleviate, and conscious that the gallant Major's presidency would attract an audience other than the class for whom the exhibition was mainly intended, and unwilling to be snubbed where he had hitherto been applauded, Nicholas Bromley was strongly tempted to plead the pain in his injured hip as an excuse for remaining by the warm fireside he so proudly called his own. But with a visitor to entertain, and a wife apt to complain of dullness, he felt it would neither be polite nor politic, after that morning's con tretemps, seeing that his stepson was not at home to escort the ladies in his stead, and that he had his character as an attentive husband to maintain. ' Every time Serves for the matter that is born in it,' was his reflection as his long head de-"], [213, "At the Institute. 201 vised a scheme to turn the occasion to account. So, as if the untoward events of the morning had left no barb to rankle in his breast, those white teeth of his gleamed through the most gracious of smiles as he begged his wife and Miss Power to be ready early. ' You see, my dear Anna,' he explained, ' as I am still one of the executive committee, it is essential I should be on the spot to receive the gallant president of the evening. ' Yes, yes, so I suppose,' she answered, vaguely, with something of fluttering hesitation, and a little private doubt how the Major might regard her husband's show of courtesy. Had not the hero's proposals been made ab ruptly, and, in the first months of her widowhood, she might possibly have taken time to deliber ate. As it was, her delicacy had taken fright, and her negative been decisive. So decisive as to affront the warrior and send him in hot re sentment to lay bare his wounded self-love to his friend the Rector, as we have shown. Knowing this, Mrs Bromley felt that the man she had accepted was the last person to do the honours of the Institute to the president of the evening ; but she had not courage to make the"], [214, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 202 suggestion. At the same time she could not suffer private feeling to come between her guest and the only public entertainment Highfield had to offer, or she would herself have been glad for once to keep the fireside company. It is possible Mr Bromley's recently-acquired knowledge of the Major's rejected proposals made him a little more bumptious as he drove up to the Institute for the first time behind the bay ponies, a different individual from the clerk who had trudged thither on foot less than a month before. His 'Ten o'clock, Thomas,' sounded in his own ears like a p\u00e6an of victory ; the voice of power. It told of carriage and servants at com mand, not of drudgery in the office of a tyrant. And as he handed the ladies into the hall, his very step seemed to say, ' Behold what my genius hath achieved ! ' The lecture-hall was situated on the upper floor, above the reading-room and library, and was larger than might have been expected in an out-of-the-way village. The lighting was primi tive, as was unavoidable in the absence of gas, and not being a desideratum to the audience that evening, was confined to an easily-manipu lated lamp or two at the sides of the platform,"], [215, "At the Institute. 203 at the back of which the exhibitor's large sheet occupied the entire wall. A few chairs for pre sident and committee were ranged on either side the sheet, whilst at the other end of the hall a mysterious erection draped in black, and about the size and shape of a Punch and Judy show, excited the curiosity and awe of the uninitiated, who shuffled their feet and spoke in whispers under the influence of the semi-gloom. Of these, some of them lads and lasses from the colliery, with a sprinkling of their elders quite as eager for the show, there was already a goodly company on the back benches, Avhen Mr Bromley led his wife and Miss Power to the reserved seats in front, of which they were al most the first occupants ; although the inter mediate benches were gradually filling with tradespeople and others. ' You must excuse my leaving you alone for a short time, as I shall be wanted downstairs,' he said, and with that betook himself and his new importance to the small library, on such occasions converted into a committee-room. The educational classes were held in the lecture-hall on other evenings. The committee was not drawn from a class competent to look down upon the useful legal"], [216, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 204 member at any time, still less now that he had risen socially above their level, and was worth cultivating as a patron, if nothing more. There might be envy in some breasts, there might be questioning what sort of landlord he would prove in others', but one and all agreed that he was a lucky fellow, and were saying that they ' hoped he would not desert the Institute,' when his entrance changed the tune to congratulations, almost the first he had received. And it was with secret satisfaction he observed a degree of restraint \u2014 perhaps of deference \u2014 in transacting the ordinary business of the hour. Armstrong was the only one who appeared perfectly at his ease. For a little while Mrs Bromley and her com panion occupied the front bench in solitary state, listening to the clatter of feet and the exclama tions of new arrivals in the rear. Presently Major Bathurst's neighbours, the Misses Col beck of the Hollies \u2014 who were said to cultivate his friendship \u2014 walked in on tiptoe, as if afraid of waking the echoes, and passing our friends, took their places at the extreme end of the bench, arranging their voluminous skirts with much precision. In a few minutes they were followed by an-"], [217, "At the Institute. 205 other grey-haired spinster, in a black cloth paletot and a brown satin dress, which fell in straight folds to her feet, one who walked with firm step and head erect as if proud of the fine young nephew by her side, but checked her course as her keen eye fell on Mrs Bromley's chinchilla trimming, and turned abruptly to the second covered bench held in reserve. And now came in a lively party, fresh from dinner at the Rectory ; a dinner given as an in troduction to the new Curate, a mild, thin slip of a man, with a very prominent nose, and long straw-coloured hair parted down the middle \u2014 the Rev. John Saville. Dim as was the light, a second glance was not needed to show Norman Sedgwick that the clerical stranger had Miss Octavia on his arm, and was making the most of his opportunities. It mattered not to him that Clarence followed with Irene, or that Miss Preston brought up the rear with Herbert and a slim, young girl having an unmistakable likeness to the Curate. He saw only Octavia and her companion, and a sudden misgiving, akin to jealousy, swept over him like a wave. There were immediate recognitions and handshakings before seats were taken. The"], [218, "206 The Slowly Grinding Mills. Curate was introduced both to Miss Selina and to Norman, and then Octavia deliberately walked up to Mrs Bromley, and shook hands with her before them all. What was said mattered little. The open recognition of her old friend under her new name was everything ; and when Irene came up with Clarence, and Miss Preston followed suit, Mrs Bromley's cup of rejoicing was full. She could not be aware that had Mr Bromley been seated beside her, their presence would have been politely ignored. Or that had not Octavia Stanfield taken the initiative, neither Irene nor Miss Preston would have been bold enough to do so. They had taken refuge in the fact that the Rector's prohibition against visiting did not extend to casual meet ings like the present. Any way Mrs Bromley's satisfaction was complete, and beatified the evening. Mr Saville, blissfully ignorant of any heart burning occasioned by the marriage of the smiling little lady he was introduced to as ' our new Curate,' took a seat beside Mrs Bromley, all unaware that Miss Octavia desired a sort of buffer between herself and friend, in case the objectionable husband should present himself."], [219, "At the Institute. 207 And, whether she knew it or not, the same adroit arrangement brought herself in front of Miss Sedgwick and Norman, so that an occa sional word or two over her shoulder was the most natural thing possible. Miss Sedgwick was the first to bend her long back and whisper, as if shocked. ' Miss Stanfield, you have quite surprised me. 'Very likely, Miss Sedgwick. People who think and act for themselves are apt to surprise others. I am not a slave to conventionalities, and did not care to cut a dear old friend in public because she acted for herself.' ' But the Squire ? And Mrs Stanfield ? ' ' The Squire approves \u2014 that suffices.' ' Oh-h ! Indeed ! ' and up went Miss Selina's head to work out a puzzle ; the Squire's anti pathy to Mr Bromley being no secret in the office. ' Do not think me impertinent, Miss Octavia,' came in lowered tones to her other ear, from a speaker who did not say Miss Stanfield, ' if I presume to say yours was an act of brave inde pendence. She is worthy of all honour, who, in a case of social taboo, dares to exercise her right of private judgment, and give womanly"], [220, "208 The Slowly Grinding Mills. countenance to an old friend, as you have done this night.' He could not see the glow of pleasure on her cheeks as she replied, in like undertones, \u2014 ' Do not flatter me, Mr Norman, I simply did what my heart prompted.' ' Do you always act as your heart prompts you ?' ' Hu-sh ! Major Bathurst is speaking,' she said, giving instant attention to the speaker on the platform, which had been occupied without observation in neglect of Jacob Pratt's orches tral overture, whilst this little social comedy was being enacted in front. But if she said ' hush ' to Norman, she could not so easily say ' hush ' to the pulses his approving words had set in rapid motion. After that, silence was imperative, but to Norman it was ecstatic bliss only to sit within touch of his divinity, of whom he saw so very, very little in his daily life. The Major, brown and bearded, as were most of the Crimean heroes, to whose introduc tion the English beards of this century are mainly due, said a few words on what he called ' British pluck ' in the face of odds, and at the call of duty, but it was merely to introduce the"], [221, "At the Institute. 209 lecturer, and he did not seem altogether at his best, something had evidently discomposed him. Nothing of the kind affected the lecturer, who \u2014 after a laudatory tribute to British valour generally, and in the late war more particularly, by way of preface \u2014 had the lamps lowered almost to extinction, and become, like the cuckoo, 'but a wandering voice,' whilst out of the darkness he described the chief incidents of the memorable war, as scene after scene was thrown upon the canvas amid a breathless hush, or melted away to give place to another, and yet another, amid deafening cheers as some well-known event, such as the Crossing of the Alma, Scaling the Heights of Inkerman, the Balaclava Charge, the Storming of the Redan, and the Fall of Sebastopol, roused the audience to enthusiasm ; or sad pictures of storm and wreck and suffering at sea, in camp, in hospital at Scutari, caused a thrill of horror or compas- sion, to wind up in a burst of applause as the portrait of Florence Nightingale, a brave woman among brave men, was received with bursts of genuine, if not well-bred applause, and was followed by that of the Queen. There had been whisperings here and there under cover of the darkness, but novir there was a movement vol. 11. o"], [222, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 210 on the platform, the lamps were rekindled, and Major Bathurst rose to thank the lecturer, and make his own comments on the scenes as he knew them in reality. With that the whole affair might have ended, had not Nicholas Bromley been deputed to thank the President, or had he performed his office in a few neat words. But he made the most of the occasion to enlarge on the brave deeds and heroism of Major Bathurst, of whom, he said, Highfield had good reason to be proud, and he was not sparing of eulogium. Before he had well-finished his peroration, the impatient Major was on his feet. ' My good friends,' said he, ' I am a fighter, not a talker, but I am bound to say I did no more than my duty as a soldier, or the duty of any man to his country, and I do not care to be overrated. There were hundreds of braver men than I in the Crimea, men whose deeds have been unrecorded, whose names Avere never gazetted, whose bones were left to moulder on those inhospitable shores. There are, no doubt, heroes sitting in this room only waiting the occasion to show their mettle. I blush for shame at the laudation I have re ceived !"], [223, "At the Institute. 211 There was a burst of applause from all parts of the hall. Nicholas Bromley was equal to the occasion. As the applause subsided he was heard to say, \u2014 'When bravery and modesty are bound in one, a man is twice a hero. Major Bathurst has only proved my case. My lads, three cheers for the Major.' Under cover of the fresh din of 'hurrahs,' hand-clapping, and thick-soled floor-pounding, the abashed Major vanished, to be joined by his friends the Rector and the Squire in his determined flight from the hall. Instanter, the orchestra \u2014 Jacob Pratt and his head pupil, Jack Reid \u2014 plunged into the opening bars of 'God save the Queen,' to arrest a general stampede, and the signal being given by Mr Bromley, the royal anthem rose in voluntary chorus from voices diverse as the conditions of the singers, heartiness atoning for any want of harmony, Nicholas Bromley's voice rose with the rest. He felt himself master of the situation."], [224, "212 CHAPTER XIV. NEW TENANTS FOR AN OLD HOUSE. The last note of the loyal anthem was a signal for the mass to separate, and if it did not dis solve quite as silently as the views from the ex hibitor's sheet, certainly there was less crowding and clamour than the first impetuous rush had threatened. The presence of the Squire, who had re turned to take charge of his daughter, might have something to do with this, many of the trades-people, and of the mature pit-folk, hang ing back to allow him and his party to pass out first. Cordial ' good-nights ' were exchanged with Mrs Bromley, and whilst she and Miss Power Avaited the descent of Mr Bromley from his elevation, the others had gained the outer door, under the projecting lamp, which, literally, shed ' light in darkness,' for neither moon nor stars were visible. Few were the passing comments on the"], [225, "New Tenants for an Old House. 213 evening's entertainment when the group of friends dispersed. The Stanfield carriage was in waiting, for albeit distance was of small account, Moorside Lane on a murk and muddy night was not pleasant for pedestrians. The Curate would have handed Miss Octavia to her seat, had he not been adroitly anticipated by Norman, who thus contrived to have the last touch of her gloved hand, the last word, if only of common courtesy, before he made way reluctantly for the Squire and Herbert. Clarence was marching off with Irene and Miss Preston, as a matter of course. He was promptly intercepted by Miss Sedgwick. ' Mr Clarence, your mother and her friend are waiting in the hall above for an escort. I am sure Miss Preston and Irene will excuse your attendance to-night. My nephew goes their way. He will be only too proud to see them safely to the Rectory.' ' Oh, certainly,' acquiesced Norman, with a polite bow, yet not without a little wonder why he was so sedulously thrust forward as Miss Irene's cavalier, and at the same time, a mental thanksgiving that the Stanfield carriage had bowled away beyond sight and hearing."], [226, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 214 'Yes, I think, Clarence, you had better go and look for your mother,' supplemented Miss Preston. ' There is no necessity for either your attendance or Mr Norman's to-night, seeing that Mr Saville and his sister are staying with us at the Rectory this week, and we go together.' By this time Mr Bromley had come upon the scene with his wife and her friend. He was graciously paternal. ' If you are going home now, Clarence,' said he, whilst putting on his gloves, ' you had better ride, and Thomas can walk on. Tim will be there to take charge of the ponies.' This was not a proposition agreeable either to Mr Clarence or to the man Thomas ; but Miss Sedgwick had already started to cross the road towards her own beacon light as a signal for the rest to follow, and, as Miss Preston had seconded her movement, leaving Norman to escort Irene, Clarence had no alternative but to shake hands with the disappointed girl and with the Savilles, smothering his own discomfiture as best he could. He had counted on handing over Miss Preston to the obliging young Curate, and walking off in advance with Irene all to himself."], [227, "New Tenants for an Old House. 215 It was some little compensation to have his mother to himself on the back seat, which Miss Power was a trifle too stout to occupy, and hav ing an impression that she was not so happy as of old, he was well pleased to discover that the evening had been to her one unalloyed delight. ' You cannot think, Clarence, the pleasure it gave me to find our dear Octavia and Miss Preston, and our charming Sunbeam just the same as ever, and as glad to see me, for I assure you, my dear boy, I had been afraid they were never coming near me again ' She was brim ming over with gladness as \u25a0 she said this, and much more in the same strain, winding up with, \u2014 ' What an interesting young man the new Curate is. I must thank Octavia for introduc ing him. He has promised to come and see us, and to bring his sister. They are on the look out for a house. Do you think the pretty cottage the Squire has empty in the Waterway would suit them ? ' 'It might,' answered Clarence; 'but I imagine he means work, and wishes to be in the midst of it. I heard him tell the Rector that he and his sister, as they drove from the railway station, had been captivated by an old, ivy-covered house perched on a high bank"], [228, "216 The Slowly Grinding Mills. almost opposite to a wayside inn, which would have suited him admirably, being equidistant from colliery and church, had it not been occupied.' ' Of course you told him that ' Bank View ' AA7as our property, and that Franklins would be glad to get it off their hands, as they are about to emigrate ? ' ' Indeed I did not, for he was not addressing me, and I was not aware Franklins had given notice. Besides, Mr Saville is highly connected if not overburthened with riches, and neither he nor his sister, who is to be his housekeeper, may care for the antiquated arrangements indoors. However, I can name it if you wish. But here we are, and there's Negro giving mouth to welcome us.' It did not require much of an errand to take Clarence to the Rectory. He rose from break fast the next morning with unnecessary haste, ' in order,' as he said, ' to catch Mr Saville before he went out.' As he neared the top of Church Street he encountered Norman Sedgwick leaving his modest lodgings for his uncle's office, and the pair shook hands with friendly good-will. ' He's a gentleman, every inch of him,' thought"], [229, "New Tenants for an Old House. 217 Clarence, as he crossed to the Rectory gate, 'but I'd rather he did not live quite so near to my Sunbeam. Why should he be pitchforked into a hole like Pratt's ? Was there not a room to spare at Sedg wick's ? It looks very much like a plant to bring him closer to my darling. I did not half like the way Miss Sedgwick thrust me aside to make way for him last night. And it was just the same at Lady Spencer's wedding. Irene herself has noticed it. She says her godfather is always talking to her about his nephew, and what a fine fellow he is. Much too fine if they mean him to supplant me. But, thank Heaven, there would be no shadow of change about Irene if fifty Normans came wooing to her, God bless her ! ' Yet, for all his confidence in her truth, the proximity of Norman and the undeniable in fluence of her godfather, gave him some un easy twinges then, and in days to come. He was just in time to catch the Curate and Miss Saville as they stood at the open door, already equipped for a?house-hunting expedition, with Irene about to accompany them as guide. His errand respecting his mother's house at Bank View was soon told \u2014 he did not say Mr Bromley's \u2014 and although he had honourably"], [230, "218 The Slowly Grinding Mills. named that of the Squire in the Waterway, he was requested to act as cicerone to the one nearest at hand, and to apologise for their intrusion to the tenants in possession. A lateral path in the high bank from the roadside led by a gentle slope to the house, which, although comparatively small, was not cramped, and did not strike the eye with the bald bleakness of so many north-country stone houses. Its age might have been coeval with the church, from its architecture. Where ancient ivy had not draped the walls and the mullioned windows, lichens had stained and toned the original grey stone, and ornamental corbels supported a broad dripstone above the front entrance, the solid oaken door being studded with great iron nails, and opened with a massive drop-handled latch, which did double duty as a knocker. At a suggestion from Irene, Clarence posted off in advance to prepare Mrs Franklin for their unexpected intrusion, his active young limbs landing him at the nail-studded door before the others were half-way up the long slope. He found Mrs Franklin too glad of a chance of release from tenancy to stand upon ceremony. She whipped off a coarse apron, snatched up a"], [231, "New Tenants for an Old House. 219 clean one, and stood in the doorway to receive the strangers, mentally congratulating herself that her beds were made. It was a quaint and curiously constructed house, with steps and stairs in odd places, deep window-seats in the thick walls, all oak-panelled, and a large living-room, into which at some time the front-door had opened, although then partitioned off by an oaken screen reaching almost to the low ceiling. The once open fire place had been blocked up and supplied with a comparatively modern grate in which a fire was blazing, warming up the room with countless reflections on panels and furniture, quaint as the dwelling. Whilst Miss Saville explored the labyrinths upstairs, scanning rooms and presses with a woman's eye to possibilities and requirements, her brother had mentally decided the question of tenancy. He had 'pitched upon a capital study,' in a cosy slip of an apartment running alongside the passage formed by the oaken screen, as far at least as the enclosed stair-foot. An antique glazed press filling up the far end as a fixture, an outlook in two directions, and a door close to the front entrance, from which he could slip"], [232, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 220 in an instant, had settled the business as far as he was concerned. Mrs Franklin, after showing that the premises were in good condition, even to the well-kept kitchen-garden in the rear, bade them good-day with a smile, well assured that both brother and sister were satisfied ; and her mind might be at ease. For a moment the Curate lingered on the mere strip of grass which separated the front of the ivied cottage from the path and from the steep flight of stone steps leading downwards to the main road, and not in repair. These steps had apparently been cut out of the high bank upwards from the road, and had been worn into deep hollows by the feet of Time and Time's children. From them his glance went up the road to 'The Jolly Pitman,' on the opposite side, where a drunken man lolled against the outstanding sign - post ; then with a sigh he followed the others along the safer slope. ' It is well-named Bank View,' exclaimed his sister enthusiastically, when he joined them. ' There is quite a panorama around it. Far away stretches of hill and dale, with dark woods and silver streams, and clustered towers that"], [233, "New Tenants for an Old House. 221 must mean Colborough. And half Highfield must encircle the bare moorland in the rear. Perhaps you can tell me, Mr Copeland, what house that is standing alone between the rail way line and a long plantation of firs.' ' Oh, that is Moorside House,' answered Clarence, checking a tendency to say ' my house,' ' and that is Copeland Wood, or \" Plant ing,\" as they call it hereabouts.' ' Indeed ! How odd I should have singled out your home for remark.' ' Is there a public road through the wood?' inquired the Curate abruptly. I observed a dark line of footpath crossing the waste ground obliquely to a white gate, and thought it might be a convenience.' ' So my father imagined when he had the cinder-path laid down and the gate whitened, to be Avell in sight. You must have good eyes to discern so much at such a distance.' ' Yes, thank God, I have. But about the right of road.' 'It is altogether private, the land and the path. My father permitted its use in the day light. Indeed, the gates were rarely fastened, even at night. Mr Bromley \u2014 my stepfather \u2014 talks of closing them altogether.'"], [234, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 222 'That would be a pity. If we agree about Bank View, I must endeavour to dissuade him. Think what a short cut may mean in a case of emergency \u2014 say, to a doctor or a clergyman.' 'Yes, so it might, but there are no places except our own and the Manor House in that direction. Stay \u2014 I am overlooking two cot tages of my own on the moor beyond the railway arch. There would have been a small colony had my father lived. But those are all.' The Curate asked no more, so deep a sigh closed this explanation. Before the day was out, the Rev. John Saville \u2014 who had his own ideas of a suitable abode \u2014 had arranged with Mr Bromley for the occu pancy of Bank View, and a few alterations for comfort and modern requirements, such for in stance as glazing the two feet of space between the oaken partition and the low ceiling of the living-room, and the addition of a glazed door to complete privacy without darkening the pass age to the stair-foot. So anxious, indeed, was Mr Bromley to secure a tenant who might serve as a stepping stone to the social circle from which he found himself excluded, that in his most obliging manner he professed himself ' willing to do any-"], [235, "New Tenants for an Old House. 223 thing possible to adapt the old-fashioned dwell ing to the requirements of a tenant of your status, Mr Saville.' He even consented to ' leave the wood gates open, except on dark nights, sir, when the wood path is dangerous, as I know to my cost,' he added in all sincerity. Before another fortnight was gone the Savilles had taken possession of their abode, the Rev. John having negotiated the purchase of some heavy antique furniture, which the Franklins were as glad to dispose of as he to possess. ' I am convinced,' said he, 'that this was the clergy-house before the present Rectory was built, and these old chairs, chests and cabinets have their history in a far past. I shall have a study fit for a bishop.' So a bishop might have thought when his books were set in order in the carved case at the end, and everything within the four walls was in keeping. For the van-load of furniture which had come from a distance was not so modern as to suggest incongruity ; nor, when brightened up with new cushions and curtains and well polished by Susan, a capable maid Miss Preston had found for Miss Saville, was there anything but what in these days we should term \u00e6sthetic."], [236, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 224 But long before visitors trod the slope or the far-worn steps, Herbert Stanfield and Clarence Copeland had said ' good-bye ' to their friends, and had gone back to Rugby, leaving Irene Preston far less blithe than her wont. The shadow of advancing womanhood had fallen across her brow. She had never missed Clarence so much be fore. True, he had left her a golden locket with his photograph, and she wore his pretty pearl ring ; but although she had made no secret of their possession to aunt or father, their rela tions were changed. She could no longer talk of him freely as she had done in former times, or as she had always done to his mother. The same inner consciousness rose to bar freedom of correspondence. She could only expect to hear from him at long intervals, or what would now seem long, or through Herbert's brief epistles to Octavia, so that the love which might have made the gladness of the girl in its expansion, became oppressive as a secret un shared. Imagine her delight when she came upon Mrs Bromley, unexpectedly, in the household room at Bank View !"], [237, "CHAPTER XV. THE NEAV CURATE. There had been curates and curates at High field in former years, young men reading for orders, but the Rev. John Saville had been fully ordained and came on a permanent foot ing, it was said, ' to relieve the over-burthened Rector.' His stipend was not large, and a correspondence of his private means was taken for granted, though nothing in speech or manner, beyond simplicity in attire in himself or sister warranted the assumption. Whether rich or poor, Nicholas Bromley hailed his advent and his tenancy. Interviews with respect to alterations and repairs, and the adjustment of rough arrangements to refined and cultivated tastes, led to private intercourse not only between the men, but Mrs Bromley and Miss Saville, so that even before every- thing was set in order, Irene and her long- cherished friend met under the Curate's roof, and were likely to meet sometimes, if only VOL. II. p"], [238, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 226 accidentally, whilst Clarence was away. Yet they could not meet as unrestrainedly as of old. The mother was no longer ' Mamma Copeland,' and a subtle change, a shy reserve, had come over the girl, quite irrespective of her father's ban on intercourse. As for Mr Bromley, he showed his best side to the Curate, pointed out the dark spots in the parish, and proffered help, alike with time and money, to remedy existing evils, and the latter naturally grew proud of his ally. Curiosity had filled the church the Sunday he preached his first sermon. Something deeper than curiosity filled it later. The mild, light-haired young man, who had been seen about with his equally colourless sister, had left no particular impression on drawing-room society, and not much was expected from him in the pulpit. But there he was another man, his pale cheek glowed, his light-blue eyes deepened and kindled as if with living fire. He had a message to deliver, and he delivered it with an intensity which roused the congregation from apathy and self-content. He made no display of recondite learning in his discourse ; his impressiveness was due more to the dignity"], [239, "The New Curate. 227 of his subject than to high-flown metaphor. He clothed his theme in language a child might comprehend, as Nasmyth's hammer, powerful enough to break a heart of stone, yet in its might too delicate to wound the sensitive young seeker after Truth. Indeed, the Rector himself was taken by surprise. He was not without misgivings of the mild young man who had come to him with such flattering credentials, and Avhose prominent nose was the only feature in his feminine face with a suggestion of force or power. It was with a very different feeling he shook hands with his Curate in the vestry after service and said, ' You'll do, sir ; you'll do.' The very pit-folk on the moor who jeered at 'the meal-faced Miss Nancy' Dr Elliott had brought amongst them, dropped their unseemly jests, and called away their troublesome 'dawgs' when they found him seated hour after hour by the side of fevered woman or child for whom the doctor had said there was 'no hope,' and for whom he brought hope of life immortal. Still his mild rebukes of blasphemy and brutality fell like snowflakes on a furnace, until he literally fought his way to mastery and respect. The cosy room he had pitched upon"], [240, "228 The Slowly Grinding Mills. for his library at Bank View, not only from a wide transom window overlooked the steep steps and the high-road below, but from a small casement deeply recessed into the thick gable by the fireplace, commanded a distant view of the railway station in a clear line, and of the nearer pitman's house of call, its swing ing sign and water-trough across the road. He! was busied with his sermon one pay- Friday evening when the silence was broken by a discordant din. A train had just before whistled in from Colborough and steamed out again, and he concluded that it had unloaded a set of passengers who were uproarious with too much good fellowship. But the disturbing sound did not draw nearer and pass the steps on towards the village. And now, angry shouts and yells mingled with shrieks and duller sounds that might be blows. A glance through his narrow, purposely un screened casement, showed in the distance the uplifted arms and swaying forms of struggling men, black against the light streaming from the open doorway and windows of ' The Jolly Pitman.' ' Another fight !

As he drew nearer the hat was knocked off, and he beheld a face he thought he knew. ' What is this ? ' he cried out. ' Are ye men or beasts ? ' For there, down upon the ground, between the inn and the water-trough, he saw a bleeding wretch, incapable of self-defence, so mercilessly had he been kicked and pounded, and stand ing astride over him, no other than Norman Sedgwick, endeavouring at once to protect the fallen man, and ward off the blows of three or four drunken brutes whom he had found be labouring their fellow with knobby fists and heavily shod feet, deaf to his cries, as if murder had been a pastime. Norman had just come in from Colborough Assizes, and was encumbered Avith his blue bag, but, wrapping it around his arm as he ran, without hesitation he had rushed across the road as the man fell, and impetuously fling ing two of the surprised ruffians aside as a"], [242, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 230 strong swimmer parts the angry waves, he strode across the fallen man, and resolutely dared his assailants to strike another blow at their peril. For a moment they stared at the intruder as if they thought a madman had broken loose, then, with imprecations not to be repeated, he was warned not to interfere.

' Go te h \u2014 thoo foo', an tak that wiv'ee ! ' But warding off the blow, before a second could reach him, Norman had struck out right and left Avith such good will and science, that two men staggered back, as much in amazement as from the impact of those strong, white hands.

Blows were warded and exchanged, the scientific cool ness of Norman serving him in good stead, as he endeavoured to keep the three at bay, stand ing astride the prostrate form that lay without sense or motion ; neither the landlord nor the bystanders caring to interfere with those brutal bullies of the pit, though women screamed, and grinning youths looked on as at a show, and swore ' Yon canny chep's gam.' Game or not, a man encumbered with a bag of documents he dared not relinquish, was scarcely a match, however well trained, for three brawny pitmen infuriated by drink and a defeated purpose, brutes who did not scruple to k'ck as well as strike. Being a stranger, Norman had no moral influence over landlord or bystanders, but no sooner did Joe Spilsby hear the voice of the approaching Curate, than he ventured to draw the helpless victim of brutality out of danger, Avith a wholesome fear for his licence. John Saville's coming put another aspect on the fray, for though the yelling blackguards laughed derisively at ' whey-faced Miss Nancy settin hissen to feight wi men,' they soon discovered that the spare frame was wiry and in better"], [244, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 232 training than their other opponent. Moreover, he was fresh, and Norman was not sorry to be so ably reinforced. The fourth brute who had struck at Norman's hat from behind, hoping to ' bonnet ' him, slunk away into the crowd, and though the three bullies stood their ground and struck out madly, the voice of encouragement grew faint, and with it courage ebbed, as blows fell faster than they had bargained for. Very soon the leading rough took to his heels, and the others caved in just as two policemen hove in sight. At the outset, a trapper-lad, a near neighbour of the man assailed, and the original cause of the quarrel, had run helter-skelter towards the town shouting ' P'lice,' and spreading an alarm as he went, had come across the two before he reached the station. Handcuffs and numbers did the rest. The defeated combatants, in sorry plight, were hauled off in safe keeping to the stronghold at the Waterway corner of Bridge End, followed by one half the crowd, speculating on the length of time the colliery would be rid of them, and lauding the prowess of the Curate and of ' t'other swell.'

The man had been carried into the common room of the public-house, then reeking with foul tobacco smoke and stale ale, and was laid on a bare bench against the wall, a rolled up boy's jacket serving for a pillow. He was under surgical treatment, a lad of ten or twelve years holding a bowl of red dened water \u2014 into which his own tears fell fast \u2014 for the use of the youngest disciple of Esculapius the curate or Norman had ever come across. Need we say that this was Asaph Pratt? He had administered a restorative brought with him, had bathed the scarcely conscious sufferer's visible wounds, and was then strapping cuts across with shreds of plaister, with all the composure of an old practitioner. ' Mr Elliott was away, sir,' he explained to Norman, in answer to their look of astonish ment. ' I heard this lad crying out that Ben Saunders was being killed, and thought I had"], [246, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 234 best come prepared, for any help is better than none in such a case.' ' Ben Saunders ! You don't mean that dis figured mass is the pitman who married Miss Stanfield's pretty maid ? ' cried Norman. 'Yes, sir, I do, and I don't know how the news is to be broken to her, for she's like to take it hardly,' said Asaph, proceeding with his work. ' Is the man conscious, do you know ? ' ' I think he is, but he is very badly hurt. I should like to strip him for examination, but can scarcely do it here,' and he glanced round the room half-filled with loungers of both sexes. It was the room in which the butty colliers paid their sets of mates or underlings. The landlord pushed forward. ' I say, the proper place for such as him is Colborough Hospital. Here's a carter has offered to take him, and I'll find a lock of clean straw.' Both Norman and the Rev.

Both of the pugilists insisted that they should be all right after a cleansing wash, and bade him 'look after that poor man,' though the Curate had a palpably swollen eye, and Norman felt sore in limbs and body, if his height had served to save his face. Neddie, the son of Geordie Gill, crouching down by the side of the friend who had striven to keep him back from evil ways and associates, much as he crouched behind the trap-door he had to open and shut for the waggons to pass in the darkness of the pit, clung to the limp hand hanging down, and in a voice choked with the remorseful agony of a child, implored some token of living consciousness. ' Ben, dear Ben, aw ken't wor o' ma faut, bud aw'll ne'er swear, nor toss, nor do owt bad, if thoo's forgie me this tyem. Ben, div yo hear ? Cannut yo spyek a word ? Oh, Ben, div yo hear ?

He con hear you if he cannut spyek. He con, sirs, he's squeezed ma hond agayn,' added the boy to the gentle men so anxiously looking on. Then Neddy was directed to hold up his friend's head whilst Asaph bandaged up a damaged jaw, with a deftness remarkable for one of his years. While this was being done, the Curate and Norman left the room, the latter to break the news to Miss Saville without undue alarm, and to have the oaken couch in her brother's study prepared for the pitman's reception. The enthusiasm of the bystanders \u2014 already excited by the gentlemen's brave defence of the poor collier \u2014 rose to fever-heat on hearing these instructions given, and when the Rev. John Saville returned to their pay-room, newly washed, but still bleeding from a cut dangerously near the temple, and willing to submit to a little of Asaph's plaistering, it found expression. The landlord had become obsequious ; and glad to be relieved of responsibility, proffered a strip of old carpet, as a sort of litter, and when Ben, groaning, was gently transferred to it, there was no lack of ready volunteers as bearers."], [249, "The New Curate. 237 Ned Gill, with the carter's lantern, led the way across the road and up the slope only too glad to prove his sorrow in active service.

Clara Saville had been previously disquieted by the absence of her brother, and the pro longed uproar in front of ' The Jolly Pitman ' ; but she was not a fainting young lady, and though she trembled and grew pale at the sight of her brother's plaistered brow, it did not unfit her for active usefulness. She was only too thankful he was not carried in helpless and bandaged. In the semi-gloom of the doorway she had not observed the stains on the hand kerchief Norman held over his lip and jaw, though he was not too proud to accept Asaph's attention before they parted.

And you won't be able to preach on Sunday if you don't use something. The Curate smiled. He certainly had not faith in the youth's prescriptions, deft as he might be in plaistering or bandaging ; that art was easily acquired. Experimenting with his nostrums on his own person was quite another matter. Asaph felt hurt, and Norman saw it. ' If you will allow me to apply your embroca tion to my jaw, I shall be glad. My uncle might be alarmed if he saw my swollen face,' he said. But he said nothing of his bruises covered and out of sight: ' If you will excuse me, sirs,' said Asaph presently, ' I will just run off to the surgery, whilst Mr Norman is here. I have done the best I could for this poor man, but I am only a learner, and the doctor himself ought to see him as soon as possible. I'll not be long away.'"], [251, "The New Curate. 239 ' That's a singular youth,' remarked the Rev. John, as the outer door closed gently.

He is now trying to teach himself Latin. Mrs Pratt was bewailing to me the absence of Mr Clarence Copeland the other day.

Moreover, Ned was loth to leave Ben, and"], [252, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 240 afraid to carry the sad news home to Mrs Saunders and his mother. 'If you will come with me, my boy, I think I had better take that in hand. If the young wife has not already heard, it will be as well broken to her carefully,' said Norman, with memories of other woeful news blurted out too abruptly. ' My uncle will be waiting anxiously for my report of our cases before the court. I can call and leave my papers with him by the way. Afterwards I will return and sit up with the poor man here. I am not a bad nurse, and you, Mr Saville, will need repose.' Asaph had come quietly in behind them. ' No, Mr Norman, /am going to sit up with my patient this night. I know just what he will require, and, if you please, I had best be on the spot in case his wife should come and and make an upset. He's asleep now. I took care of that. But he must not be disturbed. I only wish Doctor Elliot had got back. He will come on here directly, I know ; so it's quite best I sit up in case.' Asaph's common sense prevailed. Norman carried off shrinking Ned Gill, and the Rev.

Q VOL. II."], [254, "242 CHAPTER XVI. THE PITMAN'S FRIENDS. Asaph Pratt was right. He was the fittest person to sit beside Ben Saunders that night. The Curate carried his aching head to his pillow supperless, but a well-supplied tray was brought in for the strange young man, and after he had played a good knife and fork, was removed. Miss Saville saw that he was fur nished with all he might require during the night. Then, the outer door being left un barred, Susan and her mistress retired, and the house sank into quietude. Lights and noises from the ' Jolly Pitman ' could be seen and faintly heard for an hour or more. Then the last train from Colborough came whistling in. There was a tramp of pass ing feet and a murmur of voices from the road beneath. The lights at the railway station and the ale - house were put out, as he could see through the small side casement, and still Asaph kept his watch alone. He would not even take"], [255, "The Pitman's Friends. 243 up a book lest he should be engrossed and miss the sound of an advancing step. From time to time he bent over the sleeping man ; but though he saw no change, he earnestly desired the doctor's arrival, if only to assure him he had done right. He was not so self-opinionated as he might have been. At least two hours and a half had gone by- Hark ! what was that ? The slipping of a stone down the bank ? A fleet foot was coming up the long slope. Before the foot reached the outer door, he had it open, and stood outside, the study door being closed upon his patient. ' Hush ! ' he whispered, as Nelly came up panting, ' hush ! Your Ben is fast asleep and must on no account be disturbed. I will let you see him if you will promise not to sob, or scream, or cry out as women do. He is going on all right, but if he be awakened or agitated I will not answer for the consequences.' * Is he so very bad, Mr Asaph?' she asked, with a piteous tremor in her voice, her hands clasped on her breast. ' I tell you he is going on all right, if he is not disturbed,' maintained the doctor's substi tute, with impressive decision, which awed the"], [256, "The Slowly Grinding A/ills. 244 agonised Avife into quietude. He had produced the effect he intended, and, first warning her not to 'be frightened by the bandages \u2014 only meant to keep plaisters on,' an equivoque which sat very lightly on the young fellow's conscience, he led her into the improptu hospital. The lamp had been turned low, and the couch was in shadow, but what she saw seemed to freeze her blood to ice. It was not so much her promise, as the belief that her Ben's life depended on her silence, which arrested the scream on her lips. She knelt beside him, not daring to touch his beloved hand, not daring to breathe his dear name, the big tears rolling down her cheeks and falling unheeded on the carpet, but not even the sound of a sob escap ing. Presently Asaph opened the door, and beckoned to her. ' See, Mrs Saunders, you'd best go into the kitchen at the end of the passage and have your cry out there. I'll call you if he wakes.' ' Poor thing ! She'll be better for a good cry, and the slacked fire will keep her warm,' was his mental comment, as he left her sobbing and returned to his solitary watch. There she was found by startled Susan, at"], [257, "The Pitman's Friends. 245 six in the morning, with swollen eyelids, but patient, tearless face, waiting for Ben to awake, or Dr Elliott to appear. Asaph heard her stockinged footfall in the long passage. ' Please, do you think there would be any good in me going for the doctor ? ' she asked, in subdued tones. ' They mayn't have given him your message.' ' Well, perhaps it might. But don't run. It's not good for you. If he has not yet got home, perhaps you had be'tter wait for him.' Her shoes were on, and she off in another minute. ' She'll be better if she fancies she is doing anything for him,' thought Asaph, as he closed the door, shivering slightly in the chilly morn ing air after his vigil. Dr Elliott was already on his way. He had himself been up the night through. He was received with caution ; not, however, such as in Nelly's case. There was no fear of emotional alarm from him. ' Quite right, Asaph,' he remarked, on hear ing his young assistant's report. 'We must wait until the narcotic exhausts itself before I examine either ribs or jaw.'"], [258, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 246 Just then the Rev. John entered the room, his forehead plaistered, and one eye almost lost in a pulpy cushion, all yellowy-green and purple. ' Hillo ! Mr Saville, are those your trophies ? ' exclaimed the doctor. ' What have you applied ? ' ' Nothing but a little water. Your young assistant certainly wished me to use his lotion, but\u2014' ' You had better have done so. He would not employ anything I could not myself recom mend. You will not preach to-morrow,' he went on, ' that is very certain. In any case, the sooner you resort to the means provided the better. Asaph's remedy for bruises is a very old and safe one.' There was a movement on the couch. Ben's eyes were open and roving round the room in dreamy wonder at his strange surroundings. ' Why, Ben, my man, how came a sober chap like you in the wars ? ' cried Dr Elliott cheerily. ' You have had a nice long sleep ; so now I must see what's the matter with you before we let the wife in.' Ben's speech was inarticulate. It appeared that two teeth had been knocked or kicked"], [259, "The Pitman's Friends. 247 out, and the splintering of the jaw had caused his tongue to swell, although Asaph had dex terously cleared away de\"bris before bandaging. There was a wound at the back of the head, as if from a fall, which caused Mr Elliott to tighten his lips. But he never discouraged a patient. 'There are no ribs broken, Ben, I can tell you, for your comfort. One of the lower ones is bent, but a good stuffing of porridge will soon set that right, and not disturb your jaw. We will send you home safe and sound to your wife in a few days.' Pending that event he was made comfortable in a snug bed at the Curate's ; and, to the deep gratitude of both, Nelly was allowed to remain as her husband's nurse \u2014 a wise arrangement for all concerned. For those 'days,' which were many, not ' few,' Bank View might have been in a state of siege, so many were the callers, brought thither by so many motives. Miss Saville and Susan had a weary time of it, and the Rev. John deeply regretted his rejection of Asaph's sooth ing lotion before the first day was out. ' Dear me, Mr Saville, you look like a pro fessional pugilist after a prize-fight ! It was"], [260, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 248 really most indiscreet of you to thrust yourself into a common pitman's quarrel ! ' exclaimed the Rev. Richard Preston, on surveying his new Curate's SAvollen and discoloured counten- ance. ' Would you have had me stand aloof whilst a good fellow, who had interfered to prevent the murder of a poor pitman, was himself kicked and battered by a tribe of ruthless savages ? ' asked the other with some warmth. ' Mr Norman was getting the worst of it when I interfered.' ' N\u2014 n \u2014 no, certainly not. But I did not hear that Mr Norman had been fighting. His uncle would be shocked, and you should have remonstrated with the roughs. They would have had respect to your cloth.' ' They did not show it, Mr Preston. It is, however, probable my cloth may be respected in the future as a tribute to the eloquence of my fists,' said the younger man, with sarcasm so quiet it was scarcely suspected. ' And there might be less occasion for my interference if Joe Spilsby were reprimanded or removed by the magistrates on licensing-day. He encour ages drink and gambling.' 'Well, well, perhaps so,' assented the easy-"], [261, "The Pitman s Friends. 249 going Rector dubiously.

Of course, I shall have to take the service to-morrow \u2014 and \u2014 a \u2014 I hope you will keep indoors until you are more presentable. There will be quite a scandal in Highfield should it leak out that I have a Curate who fights.' Very dryly the offending Curate answered, \u2014 ' I imagine there would be a greater scandal if I had left Mr Norman Sedgwick to suffer in protecting the man who fell among thieves, whilst I, like the Levite, passed safely on the other side. But for what am I here, if not to war against sin, and vice, and all iniquity ? I must fight with whatsoever weapons the Lord provides for the occasion.' ' Well \u2014 a \u2014 but \u2014 a \u2014 I understand you have imprudently taken the injured pitman under your own roof, ' began the Rector, to change the subject. ' It will be a great trouble to Miss Saville, and all of you, and a cost likewise. I cannot permit you to bear all the expense or worry ; and Miss Preston will only be too pleased to \u2014 ' ' Pardon me, Mr Preston. For the cost of my own actions I am myself responsible.

She is always kind and helpful, but in this instance there will be no occasion to trouble her.' Norman Sedgwick had previously made a hurried call before office-hours. He was thank ful the assizes were over, for although Asaph's lotion had somewhat reduced his swollen lip and jaw, the cut lip was not prepossessing. He had been compelled to excite the wondering surprise of Mrs Pratt by calling, on his way to his uncle's overnight, to wash and change his stained and torn garments so as not to alarm his Aunt Selina unduly. He was wise enough to leave Neddy Gill outside his uncle's, and to forestall questions and explanations by the announcement : \u2014 ' Well, we have won all three cases, uncle,' meaning to put him in a good humour at once. 'That's well,' cried Theobald, from the depths of his arm-chair. ' Honest causes, honourably conducted, are sure to Ugh ! What does that mean ? And what's gone with your other suit?' A long finger pointed to lip and clothes."], [263, "The Pitman's Friends. 251 ' Oh, Norman, my boy, what has happened ? ' was his aunt's simultaneous ejaculation, nothing less than a railway accident occurring to her. His explanation was brief, for Ned was waiting out in the cold, and he made no parade of his own bravery, but much of the Curate's timely aid. A few grunts and growls were his uncle's sole commentary ; but the tears stole down Miss Selina's faded cheeks as she sat looking at him, her hands tightly clasped together. ' Oh, Norman, they might have killed you ! ' she wailed lugubriously. ' Ugh ! He's not killed, and I dare say the brutes got as much as they brought. Now, let the lad go, or he may have a fool's errand, 111 news fly far and fast. Good-night.' The grip of his bony hand was kindly but not close, for Norman's felt pulpy in his clasp. And he said no word of praise or blame. Strangely enough, Dr Elliott happened to call before the office closed that Saturday, and, ' to satisfy his Aunt Selina,' Norman consented to have his hurts and bruises examined and pre scribed for. And to tell the truth, he was not sorry to see Asaph and his wonderful embrocation afterwards, for though he made"], [264, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 252 light of his 'sore bones,' he was mottled black and blue, felt like one big ache, and was not too proud to submit. Nothing of the kind had then been done, and he had been stiff and sore enough when, after an early breakfast, he had hastened to Bank View to hear the doctor's report, and to ascertain how poor Nelly Saunders had borne the sight of her disfigured husband. ' I Avas afraid it would be too much for her,' he said to Mr Saville, ' she was so utterly crushed and stunned. Her silent grief affected me more than the noisy demonstration of her neighbour. I found them both at the gate on the look out, both strung up to intensity with anxious waiting. No one had cared to cross the black moor with the ill-news. Nelly's faith in her husband was quite pathetic. ' My Ben, sir ? my Ben ? You can't mean my Ben ! He don't drink or fight. Nobody surely would set on him ! ' But when she realised the facts, she would have flown to him, if possible. It was all I could do to keep pace with her im patient feet, she was so feverishly anxious to be with him, although I had toned down my intelli gence.

However, I am glad all has gone so well. But, I say, Mr Saville, you should not have neglected your own black-eye.' The Rector did but emphasise Norman's earlier suggestion, and that of the Curate's looking-glass. When the Rector was succeeded by Octavia Stanfield and Irene Preston, both with the vaguest ideas of the encounter, the young clergyman was thankful to be safely in his own room, freely applying the despised embrocation. He missed the outpouring of Nelly's grati tude and grief into Miss Stanfield's .sympathetic ears, and that young lady's exalted opinion of his heroism and truly Christian charity. But he also missed the glowing intensity of her luminous black-eyes, as poor Nelly detailed, with nature's eloquence, how gently and gradually Mr Sedgwick's nephew had broken the dreadful news to her, and how kind he had been, seeing her safe all the way round by Highfield, not letting her rush off madly, as she might have done, either to disturb Ben, or come to harm herself in the dark. And how good he had been calling to see Ben that very morning"], [266, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 254 though he had got a dreadfully cut lip, and Ben said as he must have been the gentleman as first knocked the brutes off him when they had got him down, and was kicking of him to death, though Mr Norman never said a word of his own interference.' Here Clara Saville felt compelled to put in a word, though it did somewhat blunt the edge of her brother's achievement. ' Oh, yes, John said it was Mr Norman who had first gone to the protection of the poor man ; he only rushed in at the last to the other's assistance.' This put a new aspect on the affray. Octavia's eyelids drooped, and she kept silent, whilst Irene gushed eloquently. But Norman Sedgwick never thrust himself forward to protect the weak and downtrodden, or took a long midnight walk to better purpose. His unpremeditated acts of bravery and sympathy with humble sufferers, more especially in the service of her own particular prote'gee, had set him on a pedestal from which he could never be dislodged. Octavia had been seated in the deep embra sure of the window-seat in the household room, with her back to the light, whilst Nelly told"], [267, "The Pitman's Friends. 255 her unstudied tale of trial and gratitude, and neither Irene nor Miss Saville noted her ab sorption. Only Mrs Bromley, driven thither by her husband, meeting the girls on the threshold, remarked the light in Octavia's eyes, the vivid glow upon her cheeks, and said she 'looked uncommonly well.' There was no time for exchange of compli ments, scarcely for remarks on ' this distressing case,' for Mr Bromley had his foot on the first step. His hip and the uneven stones happened to make the ascent toilsome, and, before he reached the level, the old friends had parted affectionately, and Octavia had hurried Irene far down the convenient slope. It was Miss Saville's task to excuse both Mrs Saunders and her brother. The former could not be withdrawn again from her hus band's side, and the latter was 'particularly engaged.' ' No doubt he will be pleased to see you when you call again,' she said. And as Mr Bromley was more interested in his own tenants than in those of his stepson, and lost no opportunity to call, the invitation to repeat the visit was graciously accepted. Something, too, he said of ' those dangerous steps needing"], [268, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 256 attention,' and departed, smiling as if there had been no aching bones or hearts left behind. Other callers and inquirers there were, people who, like Nicholas Bromley, were interested in the Curate, 'not in the pit-folk,' notably Major Bathurst, who was loud in applauding ' Mr Saville's pluck.' But there was one person who did not come to see or inquire, one who should have been foremost, and that was Jeremiah Trench. 'It's nothing more than might be expected,' he maintained with the self-satisfied air of a prophet whose vaticinations had been fulfilled. And he held himself aloof, convinced that his Scotch son-in-law had provoked a quarrel and ' deserved all he got.' He had never wholly forgiven Ben for capering at his own wedding, or for his nationality. The plea that the young man had merely interposed to prevent his neighbour's son being lured into evil ways availed nothing. Ben had disgraced all connected with him, and the Curate was little less disreputable in his opinion. Over Mr Norman Sedgwick he held his peace. But when Geordie Gill, a member of his own ' class,' told the true story of his son's deliver ance from the snares of the Evil One, and"], [269, "The Pitman 's Friends. 257 openly prayed for Ben's recovery, and the softening of the hard-hearted father, no inter preter was needed to point the illusion. And when the white-headed minister rebuked Jeremiah for self-righteousness, and compared him to the Levite who ' passed by on the other side ' when the man fell among thieves, and the Curate to the Samaritan, who poured in oil and wine, he began to doubt his own judgment, though his obstinacy would not admit it. Twelve or fourteen more days had gone by. The miscreants had been committed to Col borough Gaol for safe keeping. The brain trouble threatened by the wound at the back of Ben's head had been averted. He was pro nounced fit for removal. Squire Stanfield, who had visited him two or three times, sent Trench to engage the fly from the ' New Inn' to convey the man home, and to 'see it done carefully.' And finding himself in a minority of one, the gardener had the grace to comply without demur. ' I told you, Ben, that father did not presume to intrude on Mr Saville and his sister. Here he is to help you home,' she cried with delight as the fly stopped at the foot of the long flight \u2022of steps, newly faced with fresh stone, and vol. 11. R"], [270, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 258 furnished with a wooden hand-rail for safety. No one enlightened her ignorance, not even Trench himself. He saw Miss Saville shake hands with white-faced Ben and Nelly at the door, while they strove in vain to express the gratitude which shone in their eyes and bubbled to their lips, but failed for lack of words. And he watched the Rev. John help the still feeble invalid doAvn the steps, and into the fly as if he had been an honoured friend, with so much shame and self-condemnation, that the lecture he had meant to bestow on Ben was held in reserve for his own need. They had seldom found him so reasonable or considerate. Per haps something of that might be due to a timely remark from Asaph Pratt, who had found him waiting in front of the 'New Inn ' for the fly, and had favoured him with the information that had it not been for Ben's sober habits, no skill could have saved his wounds from erysipelas, or his daughter from widowhood."], [271, "259 CHAPTER XVII. 'LUX IN TENEBRIS.' Like Donati's comet, which had flared omin ously across the evening sky the previous year, that pugilistic encounter in front of the ' Jolly Pitman ' drew after it a long tail of consequences, if neither flaming nor conspicuous. Norman Sedgwick was an utter stranger to the landlord and to his mining customers, con sequently his share in the encounter was known but to few. It was otherwise with the Rev. John Saville, who discovered that he had helped to achieve a victory not only over three brutal roughs who kept the colliery in a ferment, but over the whole of the pit-folk on the moor, women and men, who set more store, if possible, by his humane care of a poor fellow of their class under his own roof, than by his share in the brave defence, though that had an influence of another kind. No one called him ' Meal faced Miss Nancy' after that. As for Ben Saunders and Nelly, they almost worshipped"], [272, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 260 him. In higher circles opinions were divided. Some lauded him as a hero and a philanthropist, and they were the majority. Others considered him a daring innovator, bringing a gentleman like calling into disrepute, and to this class be longed Sir John and Lady Spencer, who heard the story from the Squire on their return home from their long honeymoon, and roused Octavia's indignation by still stronger opinions of Mr Norman Sedgwick's low proclivities. But they did not serve to dethrone Octavia's hero. The event had, however, served to bring Asaph Pratt to the front. Young though he was, he had done good service in an emergency, as both Dr Elliott and the Rev. John Saville bore practical testimony. The former put him forward to mutual advantage. The latter volunteered to help the student in his Latinity, and set the young fellow tingling with delight. Norman and the Curate became fast friends. They were both musical, and it was no un common thing for outsiders passing the un shuttered window to stop and listen to the even ing concerts in Norman's comfortably-furnished sitting-room, where he at his piano and Jacob Pratt on his violin gave to the cleric's fine tenor"], [273, "' Lux in Tenebris! 261 voice just the instrumental touches it needed as accessories ; the role being occasionally re versed. This intelligent companionship was a wel come boon to Norman. It served to break the monotony of his daily life, and to make the legal and dinner hours with his peculiar uncle less irksome than might have been. But the most marked effect was the intimacy which sprang up between the Curate and Nicholas Bromley. Both men were progressive in their theories, had come from busy centres of civilisation ; both had plans for raising out of the depths of darkness and stagnation the district in which their lot was cast, plans which they discussed with mutual approbation as means to an end, although they differed widely as to their motives and modus operandi. Yet both agreed as to the necessity for awakening the community to a perception of their own needs, and each was willing to assist the scheme of the other. Their platforms were naturally different. The Curate proposed to address his congregation from the pulpit, and individually, Mr Bromley, as may be supposed, had the Institute in view. ' I consider it infamous,' said the clergyman"], [274, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 262 as they sat by the fire in his study, ' that Avith so many wealthy landowners in the parish, there is no organ in the ancient church. I am surprised that they rest content with that poor harmonium. It is an old one of Domains', with out Tamplin's improvements.

' Well, sir, / shall not be content until I see gas in all the streets and lanes. Fancy a place like Highfield, with coal at hand, and not a public light on highway or by-way to save a man from breaking his neck. Well may Miss Stanfield call this a benighted village ! ' ' Does she ? ' put in the Curate eagerly. ' So my wife says. And so do I. It's quite time a company was formed to illuminate the darkness. I am sure the matter only needs putting before the public. For my own part I should be willing to take shares in such a com pany, and to lease a site for works and gaso meter for a mere song.

I am not sure which rules in this generation. At all events my prejudices will not prevent me from helping forward your laudable project.' 'Many thanks, sir. In return allow me to say, I will gladly subscribe my twenty guineas towards the organ fund.' ' I shall not forget your liberal offer when the time comes, but I can take no steps without first consulting my Rector. I cannot stir or accept your offer without his consent.' 'Well, sir, I propose to lecture at the Insti tute on its motto, but unless I have an influ ential chairman, such as yourself or Major Bathurst, I might as well vapour to empty benches.' 'Just so,' assented the Curate. 'But here comes the Major, we can talk it over.' ' How do, Mr Saville? Face better? Ah, that is well. So you've had those confounded"], [276, "264 The Slowly Grinding Mills. steps mended, and a hand-rail for lameters like myself, I find. And a very good thing too,' gasped the Major, puffing after the ascent. ' Yes, I have had to thank my landlord's thoughtful promptitude for that,' said the Curate, waving his hand towards Mr Bromley, unseen in the shadow of the open door. Mr Bromley rose and bowed. The Major stiffened on the instant ; in another moment relaxed and returned the bow with sufficient courtesy. If he had resented Mr Bromley's eulogies as impertinent on the night of the lecture on ' Valour,' they had not altogether been thrown away. The Crimean hero was not without a touch of natural pride in his wounds and his exploits. He had had leisure to weigh and digest the ex-clerk's laudatory words, and had reasoned himself into the belief that Mr Bromley was utterly ignorant of his earlier pretensions to Mrs Copeland, and had spoken in perfect good faith, only exaggerating a little as platform speakers were wont to do. He softened, took a seat and a cigar, and in a very short time was listening to Mr Saville's exposition of Mr Bromley's views ; heard that"], [277, "' Lux in Tenebris! 265 an accident on a dark night had suggested to him the great need of lighted thoroughfares, and fell in with the project entirely. Result, a lecture at the Institute, by Nicholas Bromley, Esq., on the motto ' Lux in tenebris,' with Major Bathurst again in the chair, to the surprise, not to say the consternation, of the Major's friends. Its announcement by circular and handbill, not less than its Latin title, convinced Highfield society that the lecture was not for colliers and tradespeople. What could it be, seeing that the Major and Mr Saville both endorsed it \u2014 and consequently the lecturer ? Both were plied with questions, and both were mysteri ously non-communicative. ' You must attend and hear for yourselves if you desire to be en lightened,' was all they would say. ' Some clap-trap or other,' snarled Theobald Sedgwick. ' Norman may go and hear it. I sha'n't.' Nevertheless, he might be seen leaning on his nephew's arm, crossing from his own lamp lit door to the Institute, one of a stream of people for whom the Institute lamp had a special attraction that Wednesday evening in the Ides of March. He was more than a little"], [278, "266 The Slowly Grinding Mills. surprised to find how respectable an audience had been collected. ' Ugh ! ' said he, ' the Major and that meddle some young Curate have done this. How has Bromley contrived to befool them both ? ' Mr Bromley behind his office desk, and Nicholas Bromley, Esq., upon the platform were two distinct individualities. Notwithstanding the slight halt in his gait, he posed well as he stood, was easy and self-possessed. He had a good delivery, was fluent of speech, and had a firm grip of his subject. He began with a reference to the Institute and its purpose, designed as it was to throw the light of intelligence upon the darkness of ignorance, branching off as he proceeded to express his surprise that people so enlightened as to perceive the necessity for an institution of the kind, and so liberal as to raise it, should be content with the Cimmerian darkness of their highways and by - ways, when coal was close at hand, ready for the manufacture of gas at a cheap rate. He was surprised at the mental darkness and the sluggishness it indicated in those days of advancing civilisation, and called upon the gentlemen and tradesmen of Highfield to remove the blot from the town's escutcheon"], [279, "' Lux in Tenebris! 267 \u2014 he did not call it a village \u2014 and, like the lamp of that institution, shed Tight in dark ness.' Finally, he said, if any of his hearers thought well of his suggestion they would know where he was to be found. Or he would meet any who had the welfare of Highfield at heart, either there, or at the ' New Inn,' to discuss the subject, and consider how best the stigma of ' a benighted village ' could be removed. Major Bathurst and his clerical friend, the Rev. John Saville, were already in possession of his views. As he sat down, Dr Elliott rose to his feet, and from the dimly-lighted middle of the hall warmly thanked Mr Bromley for his ' valuable and eloquent lecture. No man in this place knows the danger to be encountered in the darkness better than I. If I had not a steady going nag that knows every inch of the roads for twenty miles round, I might have broken my neck years ago. What it must be to the men and girls who come running in breathless haste through the dark to fetch me, stumbling and falling as they run, I leave for others to say.

Then began a buzz of conversation in the hall, more significant even than the plaudits which had followed the lecture. Instead of hurrying off when all was over, the people lingered, separating into groups, as if they had been merchants 'on 'change.' o It was the old story of Columbus and the egg. They were surprised they had never thought of it before. The Major and the Curate were surrounded on their way to the stairs. And the excitement did not die out with the evening. Nicholas Bromley took the reins from Thomas that night with ill-concealed elation. ' I've made my mark at last. \"Good coun sellors lack no clients.\" I shall have Squire Stanfield seeking out me now! was his mental reflection, as he drove down-hill home ; his little less elated wife by his side speculating on what Clarence would think when she sent him the news. There was a good deal of gossip in private drawing-rooms, over shop-counters, over the billiard-table at the New Inn, and in Theobald Sedgwick's office."], [281, "' Lux in Tenebris! 269 ' Ugh ! so he has got a scheme for a gas company, has he ? ' growled the old lawyer, as one or another carried the Curate's hints to him. 'Well, he's scheming to some purpose noAv. Still, I'd like to see his plans upon paper, and know on whom he counts for directors and officials. He will nominate himself as secretary, no doubt,' was added with a sneer. He was, so far, mistaken. When Nicholas Bromley, Esq., \u2014 requisitioned to meet a party of the leading inhabitants at the 'New Inn' \u2014 walked into the room with his supporters, the Curate and the Major, he carried with him a neatly drawn-up prospectus embodying his plans, the amount of capital required to carry them out, the price and number of shares to create it, and a provisional list of directors \u2014 Sir John Spencer figuring as president, Major Bathurst as vice, Theobald Sedgwick as solici tor, and not himself, but a Mr Langley, the Rector's churchwarden \u2014 a busy little man who did occasional local reporting for the Colborough Messenger \u2014 as secretary. ' Of course, gentlemen,' said he, with adroit deference, ' though I have well thought out and digested the matter, this prospectus is merely preliminary and suggestive, open to revision"], [282, "The Slowly Grinding Mills. 270 and reconsideration, even to the site for the projected works, and the names I have tempor arily set down. I myself wculd take a hundred shares, but I cannot expect others to see with my eyes, and all the gentlemen I have specified may not care to hold office or to qualify as directors.' His moderation disarmed prejudice. The care with which his prospectus had been pre pared, even to estimates of cost for the erection of plant, and of working expenses, obtained from a av ell-known gas engineer, a Mr Flinter, whom he nominated as manager, left so little room for correction or improvement, that when the meeting dissolved most of the members were pledged to take shares, some to accept office. Norman Sedgwick, there with Squire Stan field to watch over his colliery interests, ac cepted conditionally, on behalf of his uncle, the post of legal adviser. Mr Langley, who had ac cepted the secretaryship pro tern., was directed to have the amended prospectus printed and circulated ; Mr Bromley's offer of land, adjoin ing the railway, for the proposed works was accepted with thanks.
