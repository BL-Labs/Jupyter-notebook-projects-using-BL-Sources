I have also to acknowledge the kindness of the Reverend Dr. Duncan of Dumfries, and the Re verend Mr. Somerville of Drumelzier, in furnish ing me with extracts from the church-records in their bounds, which were very useful to me in drawing up the Supplement to Veitch's Memoirs. The Memoirs of George Brysson are printed from a MS. belonging to Mr. Robert Whyte, Edinburgh, who is married to a lineal descendant of the author.

To make the account of this expedi tion more complete, I have introduced distinctly, in the form of extract and of abridgement, such parts of Sir Patrick Hume's Narrative as state facts which did not fall under the personal obser vation of Brysson, or which he has omitted.

It is evident that Mr. Kirkton had consulted it, when he composed his History ; but a narrative of that affair, drawn up by the individual who command ed the Presbyterian forces, appeared to me to merit publication. The collection is closed with a Narrative of the Rising suppressed at Bothwel Bridge, written by James Ure of Shargarton, a gentleman who acted a prominent part on that occasion. It is preserv ed in the Advocates Library, and may be viewed as an appropriate accompaniment to the preceding narrative. The circumstance of its having been composed by one who took the moderate side in the disputes which divided those who had recourse to arms at this time, was an additional induce ment to publish it ; as all the separate accounts of this affair already before the public, were written by persons attached to the opposite party. Biographical notices of the writers of the two last articles are prefixed to their respective nar ratives. The object proposed in the notes was to illustrate the text, not to indulge in reflections on the facts which it details. In collecting mate-"], [18, "PREFACE. VIII rials for these, I derived much assistance from Mr. Meek, on whose accuracy in making extracts I could always rely, and who often discovered facts additional to those which he was instructed to search for. Some may be of opinion that unnecessary pains has been taken in the editing of the work ; but having undertaken to superintend the publication of these memorials, and considering them to be valuable, I reckoned it incumbent on me to do them as much justice as possible. With a little more labour a connected history of the period might have been produced, but I am persuaded that no account which I could draw up would present so graphic a picture of the men and mea sures of that time, as is exhibited in the following historical pieces. The reader has an opportunity of listening to persons who describe scenes which they witnessed, and in which they bore a part, more or less distinguished. Agreeing in their religious and political sentiments, they were plac ed in very different situations : one of them being an ecclesiastic, another a military man, a third a private gentleman, and a fourth a farmer and a merchant at different periods of his life. Their style of writing is of course various ; but all the"], [19, "PREFACE. IX narratives have that pleasing character which marks the compositions of men who write on a subject with which they are familiarly acquainted, and in which they feel a deep interest. Brysson's Memoir is by far the best written of the whole ; and, indeed, it appears to me to be a masterpiece of the kind, for unaffected simplicity and the na tural picturesque in historical description. In the Appendix some papers are inserted which do not bear a very intimate relation to the nar ratives in the preceding part of the work, but which I thought worthy of being brought to light. Of this kind are the letters which contain a noti fication of the seizure of the registers of the Church of Scotland, and which give an account of the printing of Calderwood's History. It appeal's from these documents that the last-mentioned work, though in a form much more contracted than that in which it was originally compiled, was exactly printed from a manuscript which the author himself had carefully prepared for the press ; and, consequently, it can no longer be view ed either as of doubtful authority or as an abridge ment made by a different hand.

WILLIAM VEITCH. .Mr. Veitch was born at Roberton, in the shire of Clydesdale, seven miles from Lanark, and in that presbytery, in the year of our Lord 1640, April 27. He was the youngest child of Mr. John Veitch,* minister of that place for the space of about forty-five years. His mother was a pious and frugal woman, very dexterous in house keeping and educating of children ; which her husband knew little of as to family affairs. Her name was Elizabeth Johnston, a merchant's daughter in Glasgow. He (Mr. John Veitch) had many sons, three whereof were ministers, and of no mean repute in this church, viz. Mr. John Veitch was minister Mr. John Veitch, the father, was ejected from his parish, anc in September 1664 was residing at Lanark. In 1671 he was still alive; for in that year, October 6, we find a retour \u2014 Mr. John Veitch, late minister at Robertoun, heir of Mr. David Veitch, schoolmaster at Salton, his brother. (Inquis.

He died at Dalkeith, the day of in the year , as he was returning home from attending the commission of the Kirk ;* and is buried there among his an cestors, who had a considerable estate in and about that town for a hundred years together ; and his eldest brother Robert Veitch sold the last of it, and lies there himself: the one of them was eighty four and the other eighty-five years when they died. On Oct. 4, 1685, by order from Chancellor Perth, Mr. John Veitch, minister of Westruther, was taken, and carried prisoner to Edinburgh, by Sir Adam Blair of Carberry, younger ; and lay all night in the guard keeped at Holyroodhouse. Oct. 5, 1685. He was sent to the tolbooth in a most unusual manner ; made close prisoner, his keeper sworn neither to carry any word to him, nor take out any from him, nor suffer any to speak lo him ; and, in his absence, lest any should speak in at the door to him, or he to them, two soldiers constantly guarded his door : pen and ink were taken from him. In this case he continued for the space of twenty weeks, till January 16, 1686. f * \" Mr. John Veitch, minister of Westruther, died at Dalkeith, going home from the Commission, Dec. 1703, I think.\" (MS. note on Mr. William Veitch's family Bible.) t There must be some oversight here. It is not twenty weeks from October 4, 1685, to January 16, 1686. From the King's letter of the 17th October to the Council, (Wodrow ii. 577,) it is evident"], [23, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 5 This was found marked with his own hand among his papers. * that his examination was on or before 21st September 1685. Per haps October in Veitch, is an erratum for September. The same error is committed by Wodrow, ii. p. 577. Fountainhall has the following notice concerning him, October 24, 1685 : \u2014 \" J. Veitch falling sick, and supplicating for a physician, they would allow none to go in to him but the apostate Doctor Sibbald, which was looked on by some as strange.\" (Decis. i. 371.) The Doctor here referred to, is the well-known Sir Robert Sibbald, who had turned Papist. * Wodrow has inserted a letter from the council to the King, (September 21, 1685,) giving an account of their having examined Spence and Mr. John Veitch, on some surmises thrown out by Sir JohnCochran and his son, affecting the Earl of Murray and the Lord Register, as to alleged correspondence with Lord Melvil, and some malversations of the Lord Advocate. The King, by a letter of the 17th October, rebukes them severely for interfering with the Chan cellor's prisoner, (J. Veitch,) and \"admires by what persuasion\" they could have been induced so to do. The council reply on the 25th, stating more precisely what they did with regard to Veitch, and add ing, \" One of the chief motives that induced us to believe that we might examine him, was, that my Lord Chancellor's order did not expressly bear that no person or judicature should examine him, which, if it had been, we would have had that just deference to my Lord Chancellor's order, as not to have examined him ; but the or der bearing only, that no person should speak with or see him, we only considered Veitch to be in the condition of other close prison ers, whom the council uses to examine. But whatever the practice has been, it is sufficient for us that your Majesty has excluded all examination in such cases for the future, which we shall humbly and heartily obey. And to show that no interest of ours did or shall induce us to believe, that your Majesty, by yourself or your order, may not examine any person whatsoever, either as to us or your Majesty's servants, we again renew the acknowledgement in our former letter, that informations are to be received against the best of servants ; and we may be the safer in this acknowledgement, that we are so happy as to live under a prince who will protect the innocence of his approved servants.\" (Wod. ii. 576, 577, 578.,"], [24, "6 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. Another son of his was Mr. James, who, after he had been seven years a regent in the col- It would appear that Mr. John Veitch had been prosecuted, if not imprisoned, more than once. Wodrow says, he was summoned before the council, October 5, 1680, for preaching without licence at Anstruther, probably Westruther. Not compearing, he was denounced, and put to the horn. \" We shall afterwards hear that he was taken and kept close prisoner at Edinburgh about a year's time, under no small hardships. He was allowed neither candle nor fire the whole time ; his wife was never allowed to speak to him, but in the presence of two or three soldiers. He pressed much to be brought to a trial, but that could not be allowed. The reason of this cruel and unchristian treatment was, that when the curate died, at the invitation of the people, he returned and preached to his own people from whom he had been violently thrust away.\" (Wod. ii. 128.) Though his name does not appear in Wodrow's lists of indulged ministers, both that historian and Fountainhall speak of him as in dulged. \" August 2, 1683, seven of the indulged ministers being pannelled for breaking their instructions, in preaching without their bounds, or against the test ; five of them were continued under caution to the 1st of December next; and the other two, viz. Mr. John Veitch, once at Wester-Anstruther, (Westruther,) and Mr. Antony Shaw, were incarcerate, because their guilt seemed greater than that of the rest.\" (Fountainhall's Decis. i. 236-7.) Decem ber 10, \" Mr. Veitch's diet is deserted, on caution that he compear when called.\" (Wod. ii. 307.) \" In 1684, at the circuit court held by Balcarras, Yester, and Drummelzier, for Berwick, Roxburgh, &c. at Jedburgh, October 10th, on application made by George Veitch, writer in Edinburgh, the Lords repone Mr. John Veitch at Westruther, against the sen tence past at Dunse upon absents, his absence being owing to infir mity, on the said George giving bond of 5000 merks for his fa ther's compearing when called. In the abstract of their proceedings, they state that Mr. James Fletcher at Nenthorne was the only in dulged minister within their district. (Public Papers.) IfMr. Veitch, therefore, had been formerly indulged, his indulgence must have been withdrawn; probably in 1683. (Wod. ii. 307.) The above-"], [25, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 7 lege of Glasgow, was called to be minister in Mauchlin, in the shire of Ayr, about the year 1656, and was turned out by the prelates and parliament that set up prelacy, anno 1662 ; he being one of the seven leading ministers in the west, that the parliament took to task to see if they could bring them into a compliance with that new government ; which, if they could have done, might be a mean, as they apprehended, to make the other ministers that were outed of their kirks to comply also.* The ministers' names mentioned sentence at Dunse, in his absence, may have been on some charge of irregularity ; or, if an heritor, the court, by their instructions, could punish him for absence from the King's host. The distinction, suggested in the following quotation, between connivance and indulgence, may perhaps explain what appears ob scure in the above statement. In a cause of a nonjurant mi nister claiming his teinds, Feb. 16, 1694, \" The Lords compared the late act with the 3d act 1662, depriving the Presbyterian mi nisters ; the one (the act 1662) inflicted it ipsojure, and the other ipso facto ; and it was alleged, that such Presbyterian ministers as continued to preach by connivance, contrary to the law, got their stipends, as was found in 1664, in the case of Mr. John Veitch, minister of Westruthers.\" (Fountainhall's Decis. i. 609.)

The date of the purchase is not given. * In March 1669, we find Mr. James Veitch in a list of eleven ministers, who, at the instigation of the Archbishop of Glasgow, were cited to attend a meeting of noblemen and gentlemen at Ayr, for preaching and baptizing irregularly. The officer, a Major"], [26, "8 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. that were thus staged before the parliament with my brother, were, Mr. John Carstairs, minister of Glasgow ; Mr. James Nasmyth, minister of Ha- Cockburn, employed to cite them, not only obliged them to give bond for their compearance, but turned some of them with their families out of doors at twenty-four hours warning. Two of them, Veitch and Mr. Blair of Galston, were allowed 300 merks each for damages ; so sensible were the council of the injustice done them. The council's procedure, and Mr. Fullerton's speech in name of the whole, are given in Wodrow. (Hist. i. 298, &c.) It is some- what curious, that this matter was issued on the very day, (April 8,) that the council ordered a proclamation against conventicles in the shires of Lanark, Renfrew, Ayr, and Kirkcudbright, making heritors liable to a fine of .\u00a350 sterling for every such meeting held on their property ; and in the printed copies, it is said, a clause was added, for fining tenants on whose bounds they were held in \u00a3'100 Scots. (Wod. i. 300.) When the indulgence was re- sorted to, James Veitch was appointed to Mauchlin, his former charge. (Ibid. i. 307.) In 1675, he, with Mr. John Gemble, confined to Symington, and Mr. Hugh Campbell, confined to Muirkirk, are summoned for exercising their office beyond their own parishes, appointing a fast, and ordaining young men. Wo- drow gives the letters and summons at length, (Hist. i. 399, 400,) but supposes the prosecution had been let fall through the interest of Lord Stair, whom we afterwards find to be a friend to our Veitch. Nov. 3, 1681, he, together with Messrs. John Hutchin- son at Dundonald, and Robert Miller at Ochiltree, is libelled be- fore the council for excommunicating (debarring from the sacra- ment) such as deserted or disowned the covenant by taking the bond of peace ; and not compearing, he is denounced. On the 24th of November he compeared, and petitioned to be reponed ; but was served with an additional libel, further charging him with tak ing parents obliged, at the baptism of their children, to educate them conform to the National and Solemn League and Covenants * and with not only breaking his confinement, but keeping classical meetings for discipline and ordination. The Advocate referred all to his oath. Mr. Veitch denied all the articles of the libels"], [27, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 9 milton ; Mr. Alexander Blair, Minister of Gal 6ton; Mr. Matthew Mowat, and Mr. James Rewat, ministers of Kilmarnock ; and Mr. Wil- \" as they stand libelled,\" and no probation being ready, he was assoilyied. (Wod. ii. 176.) On the 2d of August 1683, we find him one of the seven mentioned in a former note, (p. 6,) the others being his brother John, Messrs. Robert Miller at Ochiltree, John Campbell, Antony Schaw, Ro- bert Boyd, and William Baily of Hardington. They had been inserted in the Porteous rolls, and remitted by the circuit to Edin- burgh, and indicted on the charges contained in the Porteous rolls. Mr. James Veitch and other four have their diet continued. On December 19, he and Mr. John Campbell were remitted to the council, and found caution for their compearance. They compear on 3d January 1684, and are charged with the breach of their con- finement, and the probation is remitted to their oath. They con- fessed this charge; and also that they had prayed and exercised in private families; and that they had not read the proclamation for the thanksgiving. The council declare their licence void, and ap- point them to go to prison, or find caution, under five thousand merks, either to go forth of the kingdom against the first of March next, or to attend the curates, and not exercise their ministry. (Wod. ii. 307, 351.) Mr. Veitch accordingly went into banish- ment, to his brother's, at Stanton Hall, in Northumberland, whence both of them retired to Holland, as will appear from the sequel of the memoir. During his residence there, \" he con- tinued under some trouble from Robert Hamilton and his party, but increasing in learning and grace till the toleration, he return- ed to his charge at Mauchlin.\" (Wod. ii. 351.) It would ap- pear, that he had been in Rotterdam soon after the rising at Both- wel. Mr. Robert Fleming \" was settled minister in the Scots Con- gregation in Rotterdam. He invited Mr. James Veitch, one of our Scots actually indulged, to preach with him, who was there occasionally.\" M'Ward, Thomas Douglas, Walter Smith, and others, heapl and conversed with him, on which account Robert Hamilton f^nd Mr. Bogue withdrew from them.

On the 16th of September 1662, the affair was issued by an act of Council, ejecting them from their churches ; pro hibiting them from residing in Glasgow or Edinburgh, or within the Presbyteries where their said churches lie, and declaring that they have no right to the stipend for the current year. Mr. James Nasmyth had in 1660 been before the Committee of Estates, for words alleged to have been spoken by him in 1 650, when pressing his hearers, of whom the English general, Lambert, was one, \" to employ their power for God, and not in opposition to the Gos pel ; otherwise they might expect to be brought down by the judg mentofGo&,asthosewhowentbeforewere.\" He was imprisoned, and for several months kept from his charge; (Wod. i. 12.) and now by the oath of supremacy, was removed from Hamilton, to make way for Mr. James Ramsay, Dean of Glasgow. In 1670, when the ministers in the west, indulged and non-indulged, met with Bishop Leighton and his friends, Messrs. Adair and Nasmyth are found taking an active part. (Wod. i. 337.) Mr. Nasmyth is included in the indulgence 1672, and confined to Glasford. (Wod. i. app. p. 138.) That he accepted it with a protestation before the people, appears from the Grievances of the diocese of Glas gow to the Parliament, which state, that \" generally, not only conventiclers, but indulged ministers, preach sedition, and pray to the same purpose; and, in their apologies at their entry, avow publicly that they owe neither te the King nor his Council their entry to their charges; as, Mr. Nasmyth at Glasford, Mr. Stir ling at Kilbarchan, Mr. Wallace at Largs, and others.\" (Wod. i. 380.)

A peti tion which he presented to the Council for liberation, was reject ed. Having sickened in the end of the year, he was permitted to go to a private house in Edinburgh, on a bond of five thousand merks, that he shall re-enter in a month, and not keep conventi cles; and in the month of January following, \" this excellent person died, in much joy and full assurance of faith.\" (Ibid. i. 358.)

He is not in any list of the indulged ; but is explicitly denominated an in dulged minister, in an act of the Committee of Council at Ayr, 22d February 1678, denouncing John Muir, late provost of Ayr, which will be found in the Appendix. It would appear, however, that Primrose's interest failed to protect him ; for he had been for some time previous to his death prohibited from preaching. \u2014 \" Feb ruary 11, 1684, dies Mr. William Adair, the old minister at Air, who was laid aside a little time before for not taking the test, and Mr. John Stirling, indulged to Irwine, both worthy men in the mini stry.\" (Law's Memorialls, p. 260.)"], [30, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 12 premacy intermixed. The ministers desired a day to give their answer, and sent word to Mr. Adair, who was yet in town, to see if he would join with them in subscribing their answer; which was an explication of these oaths that were mixed, and contained certain conditions upon which they were willing to take it ; but he took his horse and went home, and did not stay to join with them. Their answers were not pleasing to the parliament, and some of their speeches did highly offend them; for which they were more severely treated. But it happened that Mr. William Veitch, be ing then governor to young Greenhead, at the College of Edinburgh, through the interest he had in Middleton's page, who was then Commissioner, preferred a petition to his Grace, that he would give him liberty to see to the accommodation and provision of these ministers in prison, whereof his brother was one. This petition was granted through the moyen of his servant, and Mr. Wil liam's fair promises, that he would endeavour, both by himself and others that he should in troduce to them, to convince them of their errors, if they were in any, and reduce them to right : to which Middleton replied, \" Quod si facias, eris mihi magnus Apollo.\" Some weeks after he went back to his Grace according to order, and condoled their obstinacy; and begged once more of his Grace, that he would give them liberty of seven"], [31, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 13 i miles about, to see if the free air, and a freer prison, might bring them into a better temper ; so that the parliament gradually overlooked them, and let them fall under the six mile act.

He came up in the commission- er's coach, and coming first out, turned to receive the commissioner with his hat off; so we had a full sight of his face, to which Mr. Wood look- ed very seriously, as being much affected, and said these words in my hearing, and others in the shop, \" O thou Judas, and apostatized traitor, that hast betrayed the famous Presbyterian church of Scotland to its total ruin, as far as thou canst ! if I know any thing of the mind of God, thou shalt not die the ordinary and common death of men.\" And though it was spoken about eighteen years before, yet it is well known that it was exactly ac complished anno 1679.

The Commission's answers, otherwise called the public re solutions, were favourable to the views of the Court, and the act of classes was repealed. The resolutions, and subsequent procedure of the Commission and General Assembly, were protested against by a considerable number of ministers and elders. This gave rise to a division between the Resolutioners and Protesters, (as they were called) which, though accommodated, was not completely healed when the Restoration took place.

In 1666 he was, in opposition to his own judgment, induced to accompany the party of Caldwell, Kersland, &c. who intended to join the insur gents at Pentland, but were prevented. (Kirkton, 246.) In July 1681, the Earl of Rothes, being on his deathbed, \" appeared con cerned upon views of eternity ; and the Rev. Mr. John Carstairs, upon his desire, waited upon him, and prayed with him, the Duke of Hamilton, and many others of his noble relations, being present ; and few were present without being affected very sensibly. When the Duke of York heard that Presbyterian ministers had been with the Chancellor, he is said to have had this expression, \u2022 that all Scotland were either Presbyterian through their life, or at their death, profess what they would.' \" (Wod. ii. 222.) From an inte resting letter by Mr. Carstairs to the Secretary of State, Nov. 3, 1 684, it appears that he was born on the 6th of January 1 623. (See Appendix.) Wodrow thinks he did not long survive the date of this letter, which is rendered very probable by the postscript to a preface of his to Durham's Sermons, entitled, The Unsearchable Riches of Christ : \" I heartily wish that this mite of service may be acceptable to the saints, it being not improbable that it may be the last service of this kind that I shall have access to do them.

The preface to Calderwood's printed History is mentioned as written by him in his correspondence with M'Ward, preserved among the Wodrow manuscripts. His Letters show the deep interest he took in that history, and the exertions made by him and Mr. Wylie to obtain the manuscript. Some of the letters relating to this work, and to the Records of the Church, will be inserted in the Appendix. We find also, in the same correspondence, some long papers between Carstairs and Frazer of Brae, respecting some peculiar doctrinal no- tions entertained by the latter. , In 1677, Carstairs declined an in vitation to become pastor of the congregation at Rotterdam, and proposed, first, Mr. Kirkton, and afterwards Mr. Fleming, the last of whom accepted the charge. In the debates on occasion of the indulgence, he was anxious to preserve peace between the two parties. What follows is contained in a MS. preserved in the Advocates Library : \u2014 \" The last words of Mr. John Carstairs, sometime mi nister of the Gospel at Glasgow, as they were taken from his own mouth when a-dying, anno 1685 or 1686, by Mr. William Crighton, sometime minister of the Gospel at Edinburgh. \" Being asked how it was with him, he answered, that he had laid aside all his duties and all his performances whatsoever ; and that he had betaken himself to the righteousness of Jesus Christ, and rested thereon ; and that thereby he concluded that within a little he should be as well and much better than ever in the best frame of soul he was in, being made holy as God is holy, and knowing him as he was known of him. Being asked as to the public matters of God and the times, he said, that it was a very great depth; but if I be not far mistaken of the word and ways of God, the heart of God is not towards these men ; and that not withstanding of all their successes and prevailings of a long time against the people and work of God. He was persuaded tandem bona"], [35, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 17 for his successor, seeing he was to be his colleague after his death ; the power being now in his hand to choose whom he pleased. After some scruple to tell him so soon, lest it should come to the person's ears, and his promise to conceal it from all persons, he told him that Mr. David Veitch was the man he purposed to nominate, but not until he was near death ; thinking that then it would have the more weight with him. To which Mr. Carstairs cordially assented, saying, that was the man he himself would have chosen. But when a-dying, having called some of the ma gistrates, ministers, and elders of the place, he named other three ministers, for them to choose any of these they pleased. This alteration so surprised Mr. Carstairs, that he could not satisfy causa triumphabit. He exhorted all his friends to walk humbly with God, to lay on the dust before him, to wait patiently on him, and to shun all manner of compliance with this generation ; the sooner, the better; .the straiter, the better; the more universal, the better. For himself he blessed the Lord, that he had in some measure preserved him ; for God had made him many a time willing to have laid his head upon the block, if so be God had called him thereunto. He said he blessed the Lord, he had these twenty or thirty years no challenges for any mints he had made at the service of the Lord in the gospel ; but he had many for his short comings therein. He left his children and family on God, who had given him them, and would be their portion. If it were possible that Christ and his interest in the world could ruine, I had much rather ruine and fall with him, (said he) than stand with any or all the powers in the world; but as I am persuaded that these cannot perish, so I am confident in the Lord these shall revive in all the churches of Christ.\" (MS. xxxiii.

Mr. David Veitch is too ripe for heaven to be transported to any church on earth : he will be there almost as soon as I.\" This I had from Mr. Carstairs's own mouth, and it proved so. For this being spoken on Wednes day's night, Mr. Durham died on Friday at three of the clock in the morning ; and Mr. Veitch preached next Sabbath, (knowing nothing of this prediction,) wherein he told his people, in the af ternoon, it would be the last sermon that ever he would preach to them ; and, going to his sick bed that night, he died the next Friday, at the same hour in the morning that Mr. Durham died;* as good Dr. Rattray, who was witness to both their deaths, did declare.f * This account is confirmed by the testimony of the writer of Mr. Durham's Life, prefixed to his Commentary on the Revelation. \u2014 Durham died on Friday the 25th of June, 1658.

On that day how ever, in spite of all hazards, Frazer, to save his surety, presented himself, and Campbell was relieved. (Wod. ii. 98, 177, 178.)

And as several that were taken pri- soners were executed, so those of any note that escaped were forfeited life and fortune, and that in absence ; an illegal and new-invented piece of cruelty by Sir John Nisbet, the then King's Ad vocate; who, thinking that this wickedness might recoil upon him afterwards, got an act of Parlia ment to approve what was then done, and so did secure himself from any afterclap that might be fall. The Galloway forces who were commanded by one Andrew Gray and John Nelson of Corsack,* * John Neilson of Corsack entertained Messrs. Welsh and Sem ple when they were outed in 1662. (Black. Mem. MS.

He suffered very much by quarterings of soldiers upon him ; from the beginning of March, to the end of May that year, he had troopers lying on him, sometimes ten, sometimes six, sometimes four at once, and was forced to pay each man half a crown a day, which came to eight hundred and nine teen pounds Scots, and free quarters besides to man and horse ; which, moderately computing at fifteen pence a day, amounts to four hundred and eight pounds, ten shillings. Next year, Sir James Turner sent six foot soldiers to quarter upon him, from March to the middle of June. These had each of them twelve pence a day, besides free quarters, which amounts to seven hun dred and fifty-six pounds. By those hardships, Corsack was obliged to leave his house, and wander up and down ; and upon his hiding, he lost his horse worth an hundred pounds, and was seized himself, and imprisoned for some time. The loss of his household stuff, victual, and most part of his sheep, cannot be well reckoned. When they had turned his lady and children to the doors, they fell next upon his tenants, and obliged them to bring them in sheep, lambs, meal, and malt, till they were well nigh ruined. And last of all, they drove all his oxen and black cattle to Glasgow, and sold them. And all this for nothing else but precise nonconformity. After all this oppression, of which I have before me an attested account, the reader can scarce wonder that he, and many others in the like circumstances, took hold on the first opportunity that offered to complain of, and relieve themselves of those calamities. When essaying this, he is taken at Pentland, and, when a prisoner in Edinburgh tolbooth, Sir James Turner used his interest to get his life spared, because Corsack, out of his truly Christian temper, saved Sir James, when some were seeking to take his life, both at Dumfries and afterwards, though few had felt more of his severity than this gentleman ; Mr. Dalgleish the curate, getting notice of it, applied himself to some of the bishops, and acquainted them, Corsack was a ringleader to the phanatics in"], [44, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCIT. 26 ed toward the west country, sending their mes sengers to the shires round about to come and assist them.

This went farther than Sir James his interest could go, and so he was executed.\" But his execution was not the greatest severity to which he was subjected ; for, disregarding the claims which he had to gentler treatment, he was the first person whom the council put to the torture, a mode of examination which had been disused in Scotland for a great number of years. \" Corsack (says Wodrow) was fear fully tormented, so that his shrieks would have melted any body but those present, who still called for the other touch.\" After his death, his wife and family were grievously oppressed.

The next day they sent Mr. Veitch with forty or fifty horse to the town of Ayr to take up quar ters for them ; the magistrates absconding them selves for fear of what might be the issue, he, upon information given him by some friends where one of them was lurking, did apprehend and bring him to a public house, causing him to give billets for quartering seven or eight hundred horse and foot.

In the mean time, General Dalziel and his forces came westward to meet them the length of Strathaven ; but, hearing that the west country men were got to Lanark between them and Edinburgh, they turned their march after them. The honest party at Lanark being about fifteen hundred horse and foot, thought fit that the ministers should preach something suitably to the people, and to the present circumstances of things, both in church and state, which they did; and there both the National and Solemn League and Covenant were renewed, for spiriting and encouraging the people to this work. The rumour of Dalziel's pursuit made them that night send spies to find out the truth of it, and which way he was intending ; and coming back before day with the information of the ene my's being resolved that night for Lanark, a council was called of officers, gentlemen, and ministers, to see what was most proper to be done"], [47, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 29 in such a juncture. And it was by the generality thought most proper that they should abide at Lanark; and that because the enemy being on the other side of Clyde, and the rains having made it impassable except by boat, Dalziel and his forces could not reach them (the boat being broken) until the water decreased, which could not be very suddenly. And, if but five hundred of the western forces were sent to the place where they were to pass, would overawe them to ven ture upon the water. And, they being stopped there, they could not subsist without victuals and lodging twenty-four hours in such stormy wea ther ; and therefore would be necessitated to re tire back again : and this dash being given to them, it would contribute to discourage the ene my, and encourage their friends to arise for their assistance. But a letter, I may say unhappily, coming from James Stewart (who after the Revolution was King's Advocate) to Mr. Welsh and Mr. Semple, to come as near Edinburgh as possible, where they would get assistance both of men and other necessaries, made them break their former resolu tion, and march instantly towards Bathgate ; where night coming on, and no quarters could be had for such a number, they were forced to stand with their arms without in the field.

Now when they came there, it was necessary to consult what was fit to be done in answer to Mr. Stewart's letter. Among the rest, Mr. Veitch was called for to give his judgment ; but he, both that night and several nights before having been wet to the skin, being several nights out of bed in that service, was lain down upon the top of a bed to sleep and re fresh himself, ordering his men to let nobody in to the room. When their messenger came, he returned with that answer, that he could not get access to him, for he was gone to rest ; with which they not being satisfied, sent him back again, and told they would do nothing until he came. In their consultation, Colonel Wallace, who commanded in chief, was for sending one of their number into the city, if it were possible, to converse with James Stewart, to see how he would make good his promise. They generally voted that Mr. Veitch should go, but he refused, being persuaded that, the measures proposed at Lanark being neglected, they had lost an opportunity put in their hand, the like whereof he could not see they would get again : and if it had not been for discouraging of them he would have left them at Lanark ; and he feared that, in such a malignant"], [49, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 31 country, they would meet with a disappointment. However, \"Wallace told that, if Mr. Veitch would not go, he would do it himself ; which made all of them urge him to a compliance, which he did.

He replied, he came out Biggar way. \" But,\" says he, \" did you not see all Collington on fire ? I fear my house be burnt, for I hear the whigs are come there.\" But it was replied by Mr. Veitch that he knew nothing of it ; thus they parted. This gave occasion to think what the issue of this journey was like to be. So he went forward till he came to the as cent ere you come to the Greenhill park dyke, where three country women walking on foot met him ; and asked him, \" Friend, which way are you going ?\" He answered, carelessly, \" Into the town.\" They tell him that, if he go by the Greenhill house into Bruntsfield Links, he is a dead man ; for there the Lord Kingston, with several horse and foot under his command, are all drawn up to stop the whigs from coming into the town ; praying him not to go forward. He considering the thing, and seeing a by-road upon his right hand, going down by the Grange to Libberton way, he turns into it, and, rides on in that way till he came to the Sciennes ; and, seeing a sentry upon horseback drinking, with his horse's head and his own within the door, he turns from him to the right hand, and rides through by the Bur rowmuir to Dalkeith way.

He replied, \" Into the town.\" Say they, \" You cannot come there ; for all the gates are shut up, and guards without to apprehend every person that passes.\" This put him to think, whether it would be more profitable and creditable to go back, or go forward. Reason and light was for going back ; but credit cried, you must go forward, else lose your reputation, as a coward that durst not go forward to prosecute your commission. Upon which he proceeded, and was taken by two sentries at the Windmiln ; one of whom car ried him into the Potterrow Port, when the captain of the guard searching and examining him, and finding no just ground to detain him, he desired him either to let him in at the gate, or let him go seek his lodgings in the suburbs. He replied that neither of these he could do ; for he had not the key of the gate, and also he had a particular commission to send every one he apprehended to my Lord Kingston, who com manded the main-guard without the West Port : and so called a corporal with a rate of mus keteers to carry him thither ; which they did by the back of Heriot Work walls. The pri soner now, leading his own beast in his hand, and walking with them, thinking on his dan gerous case, sent up some desires to God, that, if he had a mind to spare him and deliver him out of this danger, he would deliver him from fear, and give him presence of mind and courage; D"], [52, "34 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. which was mercifully granted him, so that when my Lord Kingston, who was a huffie* and hot spirited man, examined him, he gave him very smooth and suitable answers, and such as gave him to think that he had no ground to commit him.

I desire that you would order this corporal and the musketeers that are going back to the Potterrow Port, to bid the captain there look on me now that he may know me, that his sentries, that are standing in the streets in Potterrow and Bristo, may not apprehend me and bring me back to trouble your Lordship, when I am seeking my quarters ;\" which the cor- poral did, for which he gave him a shilling. Here was a remarkable delivery ; for no doubt Mr. M'Kell would have owned me instantly and in nocently ; so we should have died together. * * Mr. M'Kail's sufferings are frequently adverted to in ac counts of this period. The notices of them by English writers furnish us with instances of their inaccuracy on the affairs of Scot land. In the Life of Lord William Russel, by his noble de scendant, (vol. i. p. 169,) M'Kail is stated to have died under the torture ; a blunder copied from Burnet, which might have been corrected by looking into Wodrow. \u2014 The following extract from a manuscript in the Advocates Library, is given as contain ing some particulars not generally known. \" The forementioned Mr. Matthew M'Kail, then apothecary in Edinburgh, and afterwards Doctor of Medicine, when he heard of his cousine Mr. Hew M'Kail, his being taken, and put in pri son, went to Mr. James Sharp, Archbishop of St. Andrews, to"], [54, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 36 Then, the prisoner being liberated, he went to the end of the Potterrow, where he knew solicit for him: the occasion of this was, the said Mr. Matthew M'Kail, was employed at London, 1657, by the said Mr. James Sharp, to write several papers, to be sent to Scotland, concerning the affairs of the church, for at that time Mr. Sharp was agent ing for the publick resolutioners, against the protestors against the Assembly at St. Andrews and Dundee. When Mr. Matthew spoke to him, he desired him to assure Mr. Hew that he would befriend him if he would reveal the mystery of the plot, which he not being able to do, occasioned his torture : but there was, indeed, a plot to have surrendered the castles of Edinburgh, Stir line, and Dumbarton, in July that year, and the chief contrivers failing, nothing was done. \" Upon the Thursday thereafter, the Bishop went to St. Andrews, and Mr. Matthew followed him on Friday, but reached only to the Weems that night. After dinner he arrived at the Bishop's house on Saturday, and the servant told that the barber was triming him, and when he had done Mr. Matthew would get ac cess. In the mean time, whilst he was walking in the outer room, the Bishop's son (about 12 years old) came, and enquired of Mr. Matthew if he camefromEdinburgh, to which it was answered, yes; then he enquired for the news there, and Mr. Matthew answered there were none, but that other 4 of the west countrymen, were hanged yesterday ; then the youth said \" No more ! it will be long before they hang them all ;\" and thus was verified the old proverb, as the old cock crows the young cock learns. When Mr. Matthew got access, he delivered to the Bishop one letter from the Marchioness Dowager of Douglass, in favours of Mr. Hew, whose brother Mr. Matthew was governor to her son, Lord James Douglas, and another from the Bishop's brother, Sir William Sharp, his lady ; and when he had read them, he said, \" The business is now in the Justiciaries hands, and I can do nothing; but however I shall have answers ready against the next morning ;\" at which time, when Mr. Matthew came, the bishop called his family together, prayed, and desired Mr. Matthew to come and dine with him, and then he would give the answer : then he went to the church, did"], [55, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 37 there was a widow that kept a public inn ; but when he came and looked into her hall, he saw it standing full of curates, who had fled preach, and inveigh much against the Covenant. Immediate ly after dinner he gave the answers to the letters, and Mr. Matthew said, he hoped that his travelling that day about so serious a business [[would give no offence ;]] to which the Bishop answered, that it would give no offence. Then Mr. Matthew went to enquire for his horse, but the sta bler's family were all gone to the church, so that he could not travel till Monday morning early ; and when he came to Buck haven, the wind being easterly, the fish boats were coming into the harbour, and he hired one of them immediately, and arrived at Leith in the evening, having sent his horse to Bruntisland. He went immediately to the Archbishop (Burnet) of Glasgow, and delivered a letter to him, who did read it, and then said, that the business was now in the Justiciaries hands. The next day being Tuesday, Mr. Hew was arraigned before the Justice Court, which sentenced him to be hanged at the Cross of Edinburgh on Friday next; and the night before, Mr. Matthew went to the executioner's, John Dunmore's house, and did drink with him, and gave him six dollars, desiring him not to meddle with Mr. Hew's clothes ; and the next day the executioner did nothing, but put the rope about his neck, and a napkin about his face, and turned him off the ladder, and Mr. Matthew received him, and drew down his feet. When he was cut down, he was laid into his coffin, which Mr. Matthew had provided, and was carry ed to Magdalen's Chapell; and when his grave clothes were put on, he was carryed to the Gray Friar's Church Yard, and was interred near the east dyke, a little above the stair, at the entry, being conveyed by a great company of honest men. \" It will not be amiss to insert here, that immediately after the execution of the forementioned four men, there came a letter from the king, discharging the executing of moe ; but the Bishop of St. Andrews kept it up till Mr. Hew was executed, and then no moe were panelled for that business. \" The night before his execution, the said Mr. Matthew did"], [56, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 38 out of the country, to shelter themselves from the whigs, but could not get in at the ports ; so he slipped off, and turned about to Bristo Street, where he lighted upon a man that was a cow-keeper and seller of milk, to whom he says, as people do sometimes, carelessly, \" What confusion is this about this town to-night; I cannot get in at the port, and think I shall not get quarters without ; do you know of any hereabout ?\" Says he, \" I can give you quarters for your beast, but I have none for yourself.\" Says he, \" That will do very well;\" upon which he went to his house and gave him his beast, and a sixpence to buy draff to it all night ; and so left him, for it was just growing dark. And though the house he intended to lodge in was just above him, yet he passed by it at that time to blind the man, that he might not know where he was going, and returned within a little ; and finding Mrs. Durham not within, he went up to the story above to Mr. Arthur Murray's house, who had been turned out of his kirk in Ork ney.* And when he saw him, he wondered ly with Mr. Hew, who did sleep, as before related in the print, which the said Mr. Matthew knew, having sleeped very little that night, because of a pain in his head wherewith he was frequent ly troubled. And because no friend durst put un mourning, the said Mr. Matthew did wear his black hair stuff coat wherein he was hanged, and that as long as it lasted.\" (MS. Jac.

He told him how he had escaped, at which he cried out, \" O dear Billy, I hope God has yet more to do with thee.\" Then he told him his errand, and with whom it was, but saw no access now to do any thing in it ; and it was the thing he told his friends ere he left them, that it was not likely he could get in at that time, for all would be in confusion. However, when my landlord told that the wicket of the Netherbow was open, they sent his wife with a verbal message to Mr. Stewart ; but she could not get in. So he went to his bed, being exceedingly weary ; and his boots not having been off for many nights before, and wet, they were forced to slit them off; and they were hanging there thirteen years after, when Mr. Veitch was brought prisoner out of England to Scotland, to die under a sentence in absence, as after will appear. The next morning, being informed that the west ern forces were marching from Collington about Pentland-hill ends, and seeing that he could do nothing in the affair he was sent for, he resolved When he opened his window, and saw them display their ban ners, and heard' the shouts of the soldiers, triumphing over the prisoners, he was struck to the very heart, \u2014 took his bed immediately, and died in a day or two.\" (Wodrow, vol. i. p. 255.)"], [58, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 40 to venture a return to his friends, though against the advice of his landlord and others at Edin burgh.

It was about twelve of the clock, the 28th day of November 1666 : it having been snow and frost the night before, the day was pretty clear and sunshine. General Dalziel's coming from Currie through the hills, of which they got notice, was the occasion of their taking of themselves to that strength ; and within half an hour after, a select party of Dalziel's forces, commanded by Major General Drummond, fell upon their select party that was upon the top of the hill. Drummond and his party were instantly beat back to the great confusion and consternation of their army ; hundreds whereof, as they were following disor derly through the hill sides, threw down their arms and ran away ; and Drummond himself afterward acknowledged to the Reverend Mr. Kirkton, that if the Whigs had pursued their first assault, wherein they beat them back, they had utterly ruined Dalziel's forces.

Wodrow says, he has seen no evidence of Colonel Ker's accession to the Irish plot. (Hist. i. 188.) Wodrow, (Hist. i. app. p. 78,) gives a list of fifty-nine noncon forming ministers in Ireland. Of these several came to Scotland before Pentland, as Messrs. Michael Bruce and Andrew M'Cor mick from Newton Presbytery, and John Crookshanks from that of Logan.

Among all these parts he preached to the people as conveniency offered, it being a persecuting time.

They were reprinted at Edinburgh in 1760, with a preface by the Reverend Adam Gib, who had looked in yain for the author's name in Calamy's Account of Non-conform ing ministers, but appears to have had no suspicion of his being a Scotchman.

But it does not appear whether Blackie was inducted to the parish after Veitch's ejection, or had been previously settled as assistant and successor to him. At any rate, both were turned out before this time, and our Veitch's acquaintance with Blackie is accounted for.

Then you spake trembling, and he exalted you, by sending forth from these flames the cooling waters of the sanc- tuary, that run plentifully towards you, when the gospel had a free passage, by the indulgence of the supreme authority, for se- veral years.\" (Lazarus Redivivus, p. 17. ed. Glasgow, 1795.) \" One great benefit (says Mr. Baxter) the plague brought to the city ; that is, it occasioned the silenced ministers, more openly and laboriously to preach the gospel, to the exceeding comfort and profit of the people ; insomuch, that to this day the freedom of preaching, which this occasioned, cannot, by the daily guards of soldiers, nor by the imprisonments of multitudes, be restrained. The ministers that were silenced for nonconformity, had, ever since 1662, done their work very privately, and to a few (not so much through their timorousness, as their loathness to offend the king, and in hopes still that their forbearance might procure them some liberty; and through some timorousness of the people that should hear them.) And when the plague grew hot, most of the conformable ministers fled, and left their flocks, in the time of their extremity : whereupon divers non-conformists pitying the dying and distressed people, that had none to call the impe- nitent to repentance, nor to help men to prepare for another world; nor to comfort them in their terrors, when about 10,000 died in a week, resolved that no obedience to the laws of any mortal men whosoever, could justify them for neglecting of men's souls and bodies in such extremities ; no more than they can justify parents for famishing their children to death : And that when Christ shall say, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these ye did it not to me ; it will be poor excuse to say, Lord, I was forbidden by the law.\" (Life of Baxter, part iii. p. 2.)"], [74, "56 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. hearers who were esteemed to be spies, (which was a Court trick at that time) who cried out The pious intrepidity with which one of these ministers (Mr. Thomas Vincent, author of a well-known Catechism,) devoted himself to this perilous work of love, surpasses any of the justly lauded labours of the philanthropic Howard. To the arguments em ployed to persuade him not to expose his valuable life, by his bre thren assembled for the purpose of dissuading him from his purpose, Vincent replied, \" that he had very seriously considered the matter before he had come to a resolution : he had carefully examined the state of his own soul, and could look death in the face with com fort. He thought it was absolutely necessary that such vast numbers of dying people should have some spiritual assistance. He could have no prospect of service in the exercise of his ministry through his whole life like that which now offered itself. He had often committed the case and himself to God in prayer ; and, upon the whole, had solemnly devoted himself to the service of God and souls upon this occasion ; and therefore hoped none of them would endeavour to weaken his hands in this work.\" \" When the ministers present had heard him out, they unanimously declared their satisfaction and joy, that they apprehended the matter was of God, and concurred in their prayers for his protection and suc cess. He went out hereupon to his work with the greatest firm ness and assiduity. He constantly preached every Lord's day through the whole visitation in some parish church. His subjects were the most moving and important, and his management of them most pathetic and searching. The awfulness of the judg ment, then everywhere obvious, gave a peculiar edge to the preacher and his auditors. It was a general inquiry through the preceding week, where he was to preach : multitudes followed him wherever he went; and several were awakened by every ser mon. He visited all that sent for him, without fear, and did the best he could for them in their extremity, especially to save their souls from death. And it pleased God to take particular care of him ; for though the whole number reckoned to die of the plague in London this year was 68,596, and seven persons died of it in the family where he lived, he continued in perfect health all the while, and was afterwards useful, by his unwearied labours, to a"], [75, "57 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. after the blessing was pronounced, treason, trea son ; which surprised and frightened Mr Blakie and the people ; but the famous Colonel Blood, who went then under the name of Allan,* with some of his accomplices, sitting near the only door of the meeting-house, while the others who cried were on the far side of the pulpit, Colonel Blood stands up, saying, \" Good people, what are these that cry treason, treason ?

The man told him it was better to go to them than play at foot-ball or go to an ale house ; to whom he tartly replied, \" You had bet- was in my mind, \" Let them curse but bless thou;\" and that also, \" He that rendereth evil for good,evil shall not depart from his house.\" He was just going to Newcastle when he spoke to William Col lenwood, he stayed all night and came the next day to Pontland, where he drank till 10 o'clock at night with the curate.

After his laurea tion, and losing that benefice, he made his moan to the minister, that now he was in worse case than ever, and intreated his help for a little till he sought out a place. Upon which he wrote a letter to Torwoodlee, and some other good gen tlemen, each of them to give him so much money at his desire, which they did ; and he, falling in company with Sir Thomas Ker of Fairly, con tinued drinking with him some days, which irri tated the gentlemen ; and he hearing that they were sending to Mr. John Veitch to come and take their money from him again, which was like to be ill bestowed, he took straight to England, and complying with that government, obtained his parsonage. By this you may see what a bad requital he gave to the minister that did so much for him, when he persecuted his brother at such a rate. Upon the 20th of February, 1679, Major Hope, then deputy-governor of Berwick, and most of the officers there, carried the prisoner, guarded with"], [108, "90 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. a company of foot before him, another behind, and they riding on each hand to the boundary road betwixt the kingdoms, and delivered him over, with a great deal of ceremony, to the she riff's depute of the Merse, attended with some petty gentry, and a party of the Earl of Airly's troop of horse ; commissions from the king for so doing being read, and volleys shot on both sides. He was conducted by these, first to Ayton, Avhere there was a treat of claret provided for the English officers ; and after they had drunk some hours there, he was carried that night to Dun bar. The magistrates were required, in the king's name, to send eighty men to guard the house and him all night.

For, thinking on nothing he could purchase that night, being so late, for his accommodation, but candle for light and a stool to sit on, till the next day, which he desired the jailor would please cause one of his servants bring him these for payment. And he, calling for one of them, bid him go fetch his wife, and she, after salutation, and drinking a glass of wine to the prisoner, said, \" Sir, I am come to give you that compliment this night which I never did before to any prisoner, and that is, to convoy you to your chamber; \" which was the only best room in the tolbooth, called Montrose's chamber, where the room was well and plenti fully furnished, a good bed and chairs, fire, and a great candle on the table, several bottles of ale and brandy standing in a corner, wheat bread, and a great pigeon pye on a shelf, and coals laid in.

This last fact is established by a process before the Court of Session in 1682 and 1683, against Lord Halton (then Earl of Lauderdale) for malversations as late General of the Mint, \" in making the fineness below the standard,\" &c. (Fountainhall's De cisions, i. 184.)

Then said the prisoner, \" You must order me paper, pen, and ink, that I may write it.\" \u2014 \" Yes,\" said he, \" but you must read it to the governor ; and if he like it, seal it, and he will send it me.\" When the go vernor read it, he says, \" Will you indeed send this to my lord ?

Notwithstanding all the arguments made use of by these great persons for bringing him back to be tried in England, yet the King would by no means grant it. For the Duke of Monmouth (upon the King's saying that he thought by this time he would be execute, and deserved more deaths than one if his information was true,) said to his Majesty that he might yet be retrieved ; but the King answered, \" I have written with my own hand to execute him ; and what I have writ ten I have written.\" In this he acted like Pilate to the Jews.

They unanimously concluded that it was fit for them, in the first place, to double the guards ; and then to go to the mayor to get a warrant to search. In the mean time, Mr. Veitch, knowing nothing of the news, or of their resolutions, went confi dently along the street to his lodgings, in order to his going out of town homeward, in company with Mr. Temple, his landlord.

He, still looking out, perceives the governor, and the officers, with an additional party of guards, coming up. The governor comes from them to a barber's shop that a soldier kept, belonging to Mr. Temple, and inquires at him, if Mr. Veitch lodged in that house.

(Fountainhall's Decis. i. 151. Wodrow, ii. 205.) On this account some of his friends had urged him to retire into private life ; but, trusting in his loyalty and innocence, he refused to comply with their advice. (Paper by Andrew Donaldson, Wodrow MSS. lxxv. art. 10, Adv. Library.) When called in, as a member of privy council, to take that self-contradictory oath, the Test, he declared that he \" did take it as far as it is consistent with itself and the protestant religion ; and that he meant not to bind up himself, in his station, and in a"], [150, "132 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. ing about the country these two days to find you.\" Then he saw that the dream was a clear call to bring him home. After their meeting, and talking about matters, Mr. Veitch, with his wife's consent, who was then near her time, undertook to do his best for bring ing him safe to London, and advised to send his two servants to-morrow morning, being the Sab bath, to Newcastle, to stay there until farther or ders. lawful way, to wish and endeavour any alteration he thought to the advantage of the church and state, not repugnant to the pro- testant religion and his loyalty.\" (Act. Parl. Scot. ix. App. p. 47 ; comp. Wodrow, ii. 206, 207.) For refusing to retract this decla- ration, so honourable to him as a protestant and a patriot, he was immediately deprived of all his offices ; upon which, (says Lord Fountainhall,) \" he, with great magnanimity, firmness, and con- stancy of spirit, answered, ' Seeing he could not serve his Majesty and the royal family any more in his counsels within doors, he should never be wanting to do them all the service in his power without doors.' \" (Decis. i. p. 160.) But, determined to put his loyalty to a still severer test, the government brought him to trial for the above declaration ; and, on the 13th of December, 1681, he was found guilty of treason ! \" There was a great outcry against the Criminal Judges, their timorous dishonesty. The Marquis of Montrose was chancellor of his assize.

On the 23d of December, the criminal court pronounced sentence of death against him. (Ibid. Wodrow, ii. 214.) Lord Halifax told Charles II. that \" he un derstood not the Scotch law, but the English law would not have hanged a dog for such a crime.\" (Fountainhall's Diary, p. 21.) Both Charles and his brother endeavoured afterwards to excuse their conduct in this affair. The latter pleaded, as his reason for refusing the intercession of Lauderdale in behalf of Argyle, \" that he would not be diverted, to make friends for himself, from pur suing the king's interest.\" Charles, on the other hand, thought fit to issue out a proclamation for apprehending my lord Argyle, \" that, if it missed his person, it might convince the world, at least, he was satisfied with the Duke's management.\" (Life of King James II.) \" What an affecting picture of brotherly love !\" says Lord John Russel. (Life of Lord William Russel, ii. 15.) On escaping from the castle, Argyle, by the direction of Mr. John Scot, minister of Hawick, rode straight to the house of Pringle of Torwoodlee, who sent his servant along with him to conduct him to Mr. Veitch.

Having done this, he ordered Mr. Hope's two servants to go to a change-house in the way to Leeds, seventeen miles from New castle ; and he and Mr. Hope crossed Tyne at Newburn, and went to a by-inn over against Durham. They called next day for the servants, and took them along. On Thursday night they came to Leeds, where Mr. Veitch was well ac quaintedJ The next day they went toward Ro deram, thinking to lodge four or five miles beyond it that night ; but the day being very rainy, and he complaining he was wet to the skin, and see ing we must needs take up at Roderam, we re solved to take the post-house, as least suspected, rather than a by-inn. We were not well in our chamber, and had got some faggots to dry us, when a liveryman, well mounted, and calling for the hostler, asked brisk ly, \" Came there not here some gentlemen short ly?\" which put us all in fear. But, after inquiry, it was some gentleman's servant, who, having seen us before them upon the road, and, thinking we might call at the post-house and take up the best rooms, had sent this fellow to see. Mr. Veitch, calling for a flagon of ale and a bottle of wine, and some bread, called for the land lord and landlady to drink with them, and talk ed a little, asking for several gentry in the coun- 1"], [153, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 135 try, how far they lived from that place, telling them that they were relations to some of his neighbour gentry in Northumberland. This he did, that the landlord and landlady might know they were Englishmen, which happened well ; for while we were at supper, the postboy, coming in from Doncaster, gave his master a letter from that postmaster ; which after he had read, he at length reached it up to the table-head to Mr. Veitch, who was sitting there as the chief gentle- man of the company, having Argyle's page, now in disguise, standing at his back. After Mr. Veitch had read it at great leisure, he was almost nonplussed what to think or say : for the narra- tive of the letter was to tell, that Argyle was es- caped out of the castle, and that there was \u00a3500 Sterling bid for him, whosoever should apprehend him. \" If you find him,\" [said the postmaster in his letter] \" and apprehend him in your road, let me go snips with you ; and if I find him, you shall go snips with me.\" He [Mr. Veitch] broke out by way of laughter, and said, \" Mr. Hope, here are admirable good news for you and me. The Earl of Argyle is escaped, by these news ; we that are travelling southward may come to hit upon him ; for if he be come to England, he will readily take byways, and if we hit upon him, \u00a3500 reward will do us good service : only I fear he ride much these moonlight mornings.

They went early in the morning away, and searched the house, but found not one lodger. Ere they came to Clown they dismissed the host ler,'and breakfasted at that place. After which Mr. Veitch sent the servants to the Plume of Feathers at Nottingham, and set Argyle upon the horse that carried the cloak-bag. So they rode that Saturday's night to Mr. Willis's house at Glapwell, * and staid there till Monday. It was one of Mr. Veitch's haunts, and he preached all the Sabbath to the meeting. In the mean time Mr. Veitch, thinking upon the alarm given, and that things looked more dan gerous and difficult like, he thought fit to advise with an honest old Oliverian captain, Lockyer, f (one of Colonel Blood's J complices at that time,) * Glapwell is in the parish of Bolsover, Derbyshire.

The laws in general had their course, and were admirably administered.\" (Works, vi. 14, 15, edit. 1809.) Thomas Blood had fought, during the civil war, under the stand ard of Charles I. After the ruin of the royal cause, falling in, on his way to Ireland, his native country, with some of the presbyte rian ministers in Lancashire, who were then writing against the violence which the sectarian army had done to the king and par liament, he became a convert to their views. He lived in Ireland quietly, and performed the duty of a justice of peace with great approbation, till the Restoration, when the government having for feited the pledge which it gave in the declaration from Breda, he took an active part in a conspiracy, formed by some members of parliament, and others, who had been deprived of their lands. (See their Declaration in the Appendix.) On the discovery of this plot, he made his escape to England, where he contrived to live unknown as a medical practitioner, under the assumed names of Dr. Allan, Dr. Clarke, &c. When he was in this situation, his daring resolution was displayed by the rescue of a Captain Mason, who was on his way to York to stand trial. It has been said, but without good grounds, that he was at the battle of Pentland. (Carte's Life of Ormond, ii. 421.) In December 1670, he seized the Duke of Ormond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, at Haymarket, and attempted to carry him off. In the following year he made an attempt to carry off the crown from the tower of London, and, it is thought, would have succeeded, had he not spared the keep er's life. But what is still more strange, after this treasonable act, he was admitted to an interview with Charles IL, pardoned, and allowed to appear publicly at court, even in the presence of Or-"], [156, "138 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. thither ; which he did, bringing him first to Bat tersea, four miles above London, to Mr. Smith's, mond. Writers have been exceedingly puzzled in attempting to account for this favourable treatment. In 1680, he was accused of a conspiracy against the Duke of Buckingham, but while he was preparing for his trial, he sickened and died. The terror which he had inspired did not cease with his life * his burial was looked on as a trick ; the body was disinterred, and, after a strict exami nation, was at last identified as his, by the uncommon size of the left thumb. (See Biographia Britan. 2d edit. art. Blood, where almost every thing written about him is collected.) Baxter ap pears to have entertained, upon the whole, a favourable opinion of his character. (Life, part iii. p. 88.) Carte exclaims against his \" matchless impudence, in pretending to godliness and tenderness of conscience.\" (Life of Ormond, ii. 423.) Evelyn, who dined with him in the Lord Treasurer's, along with several French no blemen, after his attempt on the crown, says, he \" had not only a daring but a villainous, unmerciful look, a false countenance, but very well-spoken, and dangerously insinuating.\" (Memoirs, i. 413.) But Evelyn was a better virtuoso than judge of character. Blood was of a restless disposition, and desperate courage ; but it is not so evident that he was cruel, perfidious, or altogether devoid of a sense of religion. From the following extract of a letter from Lord Arlington to the Duke of Ormond, Aug. 25, 1666, it appears that Blood was an author : \"lam assured from several hands, that Blood alias Mene Tekel, so called from the villainous book he wrote with that title, and some few others of the same principles, are lately gone into that kingdom (Ireland,) hoping to work effectually their wicked ends upon the new militia especially.\" (Brown's Miscell.

On this account he was favour ably received at court on the Restoration ; and the same cause had rendered him an object of jealousy to Cromwell's officers, and caused his being imprisoned on every new occasion. (Burnet, i. 106.) It would appear that on some of these occasions, Holmes had commanded the party that apprehended him. When Argyle, in the end of 1682, escaped to Holland, his correspondence with his friends at home passed through the Major's hands, who being ap prehended among the first, and examined, 29th June 1683, some letters in cyphers were found with him, which involved Mr. Wil liam Spence, and eventually Mr. William Carstairs, and occasion ed their being tortured.

After the hurry about his escape was over, Madam Smith brought out Mr. Hope and Mr. Veitch with him, to stay at their new house at Brentford, seven miles off the city ; and not long after, several nobility, gentry, and rich merchants, some in the city of London, and some elsewhere, began to meet secretly, to see if they could fall upon any measures to prevent these nations, and the church of Christ therein, from sinking into popery and slavery, but all to little purpose, for it ended in that discovery that they called Mon mouth's plot ; * when several gentlemen of Scot land, and Mr. William Carstairs, were taken in London, and brought down to Edinburgh pri- * More commonly called the llye-house Plot."], [160, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 142 soners ; some of them put to torture, and the great, learned and pious Jerviswood was cruelly put to death.* Mr. Hope kept himself retired still from all these meetings, yet he knew their measures, and they wanted not his advice ; for he made himself known to none of these great persons at London by personal converse, t except only to Sir Arthur Forbes, the Earl of Granard, and Lord Lieute nant of Ireland, with whom formerly he had a peculiar intimacy and friendship.

They had only one other congress at the same place, though, in the interim, Captain Forbes went betwixt them with several messages, and was much caressed by the Earl of Granard to go along with him to Ireland, and he would prefer him to as profitable and honourable a post as possible, for which the captain heartily thanked his Lordship, but told him that in good manners he could not leave the Earl of Argyle. At the second and last congress, which they had at the same place, they concluded to join with the Duke of Monmouth, and the honest no bility, gentry, and commons of England, that"], [162, "144 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. should appear for the protestant interest, &c. Argyle heading the same in Scotland ; and the Earl of Granard in Ireland ; and that he should, whenever Argyle appeared in the west of Scot land, send over out of Ireland five thousand trained soldiers to assist Argyle. Upon which Mr. Forbes did see the two Earls pass their pa role, and change their walking canes upon that head. But when the time came, nothing of this was performed, and what was the obstruction he knows not.* * Arthur Forbes, Eari of Granard, was the son of Arthur Forbes of Castle Forbes, who, after bearing arms on the Continent, setlled in Ireland, was created a baronet in 1628, and died in 1632. Sir Arthur was the 4th son of William Forbes of Corse and Oneil, and brother of Patrick, bishop of Aberdeen, and John, minister of Alford, who was banished to Holland for assisting at the Ge neral Assembly held in Aberdeen in 1605. (Douglas's Baron age of Scotland, p. 76. Lodge's Peerage of Ireland, i. p. 378, 379. Life of Andrew Melville, ii. 292, 2d edit.) His son was active in transporting troops from Ireland to Scotland in 1648, to join the Duke of Hamilton in his expedition to England. (Act. Parl. Scot. vii. App. 97.) He commanded a party of horse under Glencaim and Middleton in the Highlands of Scotland, when they appeared for Charles II. in the years 1653 and 1654, and distin guished himself in several encounters with the English. Being ta ken prisoner and confined in the Castle of Edinburgh, the Earl of Argyle, then Lord Lorn, at the time of his capitulation, exerted himself in procuring his liberation, \" for furthering his Majesty's service, and for personal respect to Sir Arthur.\" (Supplement to Diet, of Dec. vol. ii. 687, 688. Wodrow, ii. App. p. 65. Baillie's Letters, ii. 377, 382, 394. Lodge, i. 379, 380. Military Memoirs of the Civil War, p. 101. et passim.) In February 1660, he was sent to Brussels by Sir Charles Coote (afterwards Earl of Montrath) \" to assure the King of his duty, and to give him an account of"], [163, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 145 My Lord Argyle upon the prospect of the dis covery went to Holland ; * and Madam Smith, the state of the kingdom.\" (Carte's Ormond, ii. 203. Brown's Miscellanea Aulica, p. 334.) His loyalty caused him to be em- ployed and advanced after the Restoration. In 1663, he was sworn in a member of the Privy Council ; in 1 670, made Marshal of the army; in 1675, Viscount Granard ; and in 1684, Earl of Granard. (Lodge, i. 381, 382.) Veitch is mistaken in calling him Lord Lieutenant of Ireland : he never held that office, but he was on several occasions one of the two Lords Justices. (Lodge, ut supra.) Though loyal, he was decidedly attached to the protes- tant religion, and favourable to the presby ierian ministers in the North of Ireland. It was through his influence that Charles II. granted them a sum of L.600 annually, which was intrusted to Granard, and doubled at the Revolution. (Memoirs of Ireland, p. 39, 40. Hist. Essay on the Loyalty of Presbyterians, p. 383 \u2014 385. Wodrow, i. 270.) In the projet of the Whig Coun- cil of 1679, he was one of three lords, supposed to be firm protes- tants, from whom it was proposed to choose the Chief Governor of Ireland. (Carte's Ormond, p. 494, 495.) The author of the Memoirs of Ireland says, that on the Duke of Monmouth's inva- sion, some were apt to believe that Granard was in suspence whom to declare for, but \" the unalterable steadiness\" of the Lord Pri- mate Boyle, who was one of the Lords Justices, \" hindered the other from deserting.\" Hume says, that at that time \" the whole power was in the hands of Talbot, the general, soon after created Earl of Tyrconnel.\" (Hist. vol. ix. 25 1. Lond. 1811.) Oates had marked Talbot for this employment, whence it came to be ob- served, \" that if Oates was an ill evidence, he was certainly a good prophet.\" (Bennet's Memorial, p. 313.) At the Revolution the Earl of Granard adhered to James, and sat in his Privy Council and Parliament in 1689; but becoming satisfied of the duplicity of that Monarch and his intentions to establish popery, he left him and went over to William in 1690. (Plowden's Hist. of Ireland, i. 182, 189. Memoirs of Ireland, p. 39. Lady Rus set's Letters, p. 214.

Mr. Veitch came from London down to the North to see his family and friends about fourteen days before it broke out, * and so escaped being taken with the Scotch gen try ; and after he had wearied himself in hiding, sometimes in one place, and sometimes another, he was necessitated to steal over to Holland. His brother Mr. James and his wife being banished by the Duke of York, and coming to his house at Stantonhall, being afraid to stay there, went along with him.t where he was on his hiding, and did escape.\" (Law's Memorials, p. 236.) From Carstairs's deposition, (Act. Parl. Scot. viii. App. p. 34, 35.) and Gordon of Earlston's, (Sprat's Copies of Informa tions, p. 142.) it would appear that Argyle was in Holland in or about December 1682. * The first information of the plot was given by Kealing on \" the happy twelfth of June,\" 1683, says Sprat; and the conspira tors met \" on Monday June 18th, at Walcot's Lodgings, in Good man's Fields, to consult, once for all, what should be done for their common safety.\" (Acco. of the Conspiracy, p. 89, 91.

Both of them had great promises sent them of assistance, but it turned to nothing, as the public history tells. And no wonder, for the one part kept not their promises, and the other parties followed not the measures contrived and concerted at Amsterdam ; to which meeting Mr. Veitch, with much per- suasion, brought old President Stairs ; and it cost him giving in bond for L.1000 Sterling to Madam Smith, who lent out L.6000 or L.7000 more, her husband being now dead, to my Lord Argyle and others, for the better carrying on that enterprise.

He had also a verbal commission, and a token for showing the verity of his commission from my Lord Gray to his chief steward in Northumberland, to instigate him to raise what forces of horse and foot he could upon his charges, that they might be ready to appear when they heard of Monmouth's landing in the South. Mr. Veitch also had a verbal commis sion from Argyle to procure money for buying of arms, colours, drums, horses, and taking on men, especially old Oliverian officers ; somewhat of all which he did, and through his too much travel ling through the country, and the zeal of severals in many places to rise, the matter was like to take wind, so that he was forced to retire up to the mountains in the borders near Reidsdale-head, and hide himself from his very friends, until the season of appearing came. For Colonel Strother in the English side getting some notice of him, sent an express to the Scotch council hereanent ; and they sent an express to the Earl of Lothian who commanded the militia in Tiviotdale, and to Meldrum whose troop was lying there, to join with Strother in searching the suspected places of the border to find him, which they did. They come upon a hill called the Carter, where Mr."], [167, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 149 Veitch was lying in a hut among the rocks cover ed with heather-turfs as if they had been grow ing, which honest Mr. Thomas Steel had made up for himself, when he was forced to flee upon Aaron Smith's coming from London upon that errand ; * which place he assigned unto him, and he was lying in it when these great persons were riding along that hill on every side of him ; for no horse could come where he was. He was only afraid of their dogs, but providence ordered it well ; for they missed their mark. * Thomas Steil was Chamberlain of Jedburgh Forest to James, Marquis of Douglas. About the middle of February 1083, Aaron Smith, being sent from the English Whigs to Sir John Cochran, and other friends in Scotland, came, the Thursday before Shrove Tuesday, to Newcastle, where Sheriff, the inn-keeper with whom he lodged, obtained one Bell to be his guide to Jedburgh, to Steil who was his (Sheriff's) acquaintance. From Jedburgh he was con ducted to Douglas by Andrew Olipher, who was previously engag ed, and now on his way to bring home Steil's wife from the latter place. Smith not finding a guide there, Mrs. Steil permitted Olipher to go forward with him to Ochiltric, where he left him. He passed by the name of Samuel Clerk, and said that he was on the Carolina business. (Sprat's Account, 183, 184, 185; Copies of Informations, 154, 155, 150.) On the discovery of the plot, and trial of those accused, Steil appears to have become alarmed, and provided the hut above mentioned for his concealment. Being at length apprehended, he, with Andrew Olipher, was, on the llth of December 1083, examined by the committee for public affairs. On the 20th of that month, en the petition of the Marquis asserting Steil's innocence, and urging the injury his Lordship's affairs would suffer by his detention, the Council liberated him, on a bond that he should compear, and not leave the kingdom without licence, under a penalty of two thousand merks. ( Privy Council Records.)"], [168, "150 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. The news coming that Argyle was landed in the Highlands, he knew not how to get the truth of it, but sent one night for Mr. Steel, by honest Sanders Stevenson his man, who came every night with milk, and bread, and cheese, to him. And they advising together how to get sure notice, thought it necessary to send one to Edinburgh, to a trusty friend there, to see if he could procure two printed passes, for at that time none could travel without them ; and filled up the names of two persons that he sent west, one toward Dumbarton, and another toward Irvine, to bring him a true account, which one of them did ; but it was a sad account, viz. that Argyle and his party were broken at Muirdykes, and he himself taken near Paisley, which occasioned no small sorrow to Mr. Steel and Mr. Veitch, and to all their other friends, for they concluded now their case to be hopeless and helpless, there being no other mean in outward appearance now left ; and (which put on the copestone of all,) within a few days after, the news of Monmouth's being broken came down to Newcastle by post, and peremp tory and strict orders to search for all suspected persons, and to apprehend and strictly examine all travellers by sea and land. After the Earl of Argyle was apprehended at Paisley, he was carried to Edinburgh, and exe cuted upon the old sentence, without any respect"], [169, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 151 had to this invasion.* He was a person of great wit and policy, and true piety, so far as ever Mr. Veitch could discern, who was in his company from the time he carried him from his own house (being recommended to his care by the laird of Torwoodlee, who sent him to his house with his own servant and horses) until he sent him from Amsterdam, some weeks before he took shipping there for Scotland. For, as he hath formerly hinted, he bought horses at his own charge to carry Argyle and his servants to London ; and furnished him money both by the way and after ward. When his son Charles, and black John Campbell came to London, having lost a little ship that was laden by sea, called the Anne of Argyle, they had nothing either to maintain them while they staid in the city or carry them home, but as Mr. Veitch gave them.

But my lord Argyle would by no means part with him, which made him beg my lord Shaftes- bury's excuse, who was not well pleased. And it was a considerable loss to Mr. Veitch, for he that went with him in his room, besides all other things, got a hundred guineas for a few months service abroad, where he died. Likewise, he was at a loss, by his absence from his people, and his meeting house being supplied by another in his room, who got the salary. And Argyle and the other Scotch gentry employed him to ride seven times between London and the borders of Scot land in nine months time, and he had nothing for it but seven pounds Sterling, and spent other seven pounds of my own.* He would have him also to go straight to Hol land with him, and his trunk was sent with my lord's down to the ship.

Yet, as is formerly hinted, he followed him shortly to Holland, after he had visited his family and friends in the north ; and waiting on him in that country, with the things he bought there to prepare him for his undertaking for Scotland, he spent L.50 Sterling of his own money. And, moreover, as has been hinted, upon his desire, when he parted from Amster dam to execute his commission in Northum berland and the borders, he gave him not one sixpence of all the money and gold he had bor rowed either to bear his charges, or buy the arms, and do the other things that he instructed him about, viz. giving to some old Oliverian officers fifteen, and some twenty guineas a-piece, to en gage them and fit them for that service, some eleven pounds, some ten, some four. To many he gave pistols and swords, and money to buy furniture of that nature. He also provided co lours, a pair of which he had kept till after the Revolution, and showed them to the Duke of Argyle, his son. The waiting upon Argyle also, so long together, occasioned him to lose L.I 20 Sterling of lent money, with the interest of it, to Mr. Horsley of Millburn Grange, * not having a security upon his estate for it, and the credi tors upon his death running away with the exe cutry, when Mr. Veitch was abroad ; so that all the money from the very horses that he bought * See before, p. 133."], [172, "154 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. at first, and the other things narrated, was never paid to Mr. Veitch, nor any of his, to this day. Besides all this, any body would think that Mr. Veitch deserved a considerable reward for venturing his life and fortune over again, being but lately relieved out of that danger, and leav ing his wife big with child within a few weeks of her time, and a numerous family to subsist upon a very small farm that there he was re dacted to, being exhausted and impoverished by his former imprisonment and other troubles, where his life was at the stake. But though these things were represented to his son, the late Duke of Argyle, who gave Mr. Veitch many repeated promises to reimburse him, and an account only of his real outlayings there was left in his custody with a letter subjoined, which no doubt his executors found among his papers, yet never was there any thing done ; and Mr. Veitch may say that some of his children, to whom he had been very kind, gave him frowns and sum mons upon false grounds, and reproaches behind his back, instead of thanks. This I confess to the commendation of the suf fering Earl, that, walking with him in Madam Smith's garden at Brentford, in an unexpected discourse, he acknowledged to Mr. Veitch his great kindness in venturing over again his all in the world, yea his life, to serve him, who was never acquainted with him formerly ; and that"], [173, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 155 he not only resolved to give him a suitable re ward in money, but he would give him a free farm, worth about four hundred merks per an num, lying near Campbeltown, as he remembers, disponed to him and his posterity for ever, for that good service he had done him ; and that it should be mentioned in the disposition, that his posterity might always show kindness to Mr. Veitch's posterity ; and if Mr. Veitch had sought a bond of him, he, without doubt, had given him it. But he never dreamed of such a thing, think ing always they would live together afterwards, and the thing would be done. The Duke of Monmouth was apprehended hid ing himself among long braikers or ferns in the field, shortly after the defeat of his army ; and public history gives an account of his execu tion. It was never heard (after Lauderdale had procured his being banished from the court when he came out of Scotland after Bothwell Bridge, without so much as coming to court, and going instantly to Holland) that ever he saw the king's face, except once before his majesty died ; * when, being deeply impressed and troub- * Veitch appears to have forgotten Monmouth's reception at court after the Ryehouse plot.

Upon which his majesty sent him word with the bearer when and where to meet him. The matter was, that he was cre dibly informed that there was a design laying by the Duke of York and his cabal, to cut him off, and he could not but venture all that was dearest to him to come and acquaint him therewith. At out for apprehending him, King Charles not only knew where he was, and sent him messages every day, but saw him several times in private.\" (Memoirs, p. 100, 107.) That Monmouth had an interview with the king a short time before the death of the latter, as stated by Veitch, is confirmed by the following passage in Carte. \" Though the Duke of York was a principal means in bring ing his Majesty to recal the Duke of Ormond, yet, within a month after the king had notified that resolution, the Duke of Monmouth was suffered to come over into England, and admitted to a private interview with his Majesty, who, to remove his royal highness from about him, determined to send him to hold a parliament in Scotland, on March 10th following.\" (Carte's Life of Ormond, ii. 539.)

So that after they had discoursed to the full, ere they parted, the king gave him as many jewels out of his cabinet as were valued at ten thousand pounds Sterling, and a secret order to his cashier to pay to the lord Allington, for the use of a friend of his, ten thousand pounds Sterling, as it is said : so he returned incognito again to Hol land. This alarm put the king upon a more serious inquiry anent this matter, and finding several things that increased his fears, he sent one of his domestic servants to the lord Allington to desire him to come at such an hour, which being late at night, he thought it would be most quiet and unknown, and undiscovered. But it proved not so ; and the reason that was frequently given for it was this, that the Duke of York had so awed, influenced, and bribed all that used about the king, even to the meanest station, that nothing could be done now by the king, never so secret ly, but it came presently to York's ears, so that he was not only able to carry on the fore said design, but to frustrate all opposition there unto."], [176, "158 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. Now the king's business with Allington was this \u2014 to take his advice, he being a wise man, and one of his greatest confidents at that time, about what measures he should make use of to prevent the Duke of York and his cabal's destroying of him ; for he saw now it was in evitably a-coming. To which Allington replied, \" Sir, you have brought it upon yourself, by your turning out Monmouth out of all his places, especially his command over the guards about your person, and suffering such to be put in who were York's creatures.\" \" But what shall I do now,\" said the king ? \" Sir,\" said he, \" I neither can nor dare advise you in that matter ; for if it be heard, as likely it will, it may hasten both our ruins.\" The king promised solemnly to keep it secret, and would not part with him till he told him, and that he would presently put them in execution ; and whatever befel him he should never discover or wrong Allington ; and they pa roled upon it. \" Now,\" says he, \" Sir, my ad vice is this, that seeing within a few weeks the appointed time will be that the Duke of York is obliged to go to Scotland, to hold the next ses sion of his parliament, take care to give him his commission, and send him timeously away ; and when he is there, send for Monmouth, re store him to all his places, and remove from the court all persons that are suspected to favour York's interest, as also, out of your guards, and"], [177, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 159 double them. When this is once done, he being in Scotland, we will see then what is farther to be done.\" This proved a costly advice to them both, for no doubt but there were some overhearing behind the curtain, who told all to York, as appears by the event. A little after, the king sends for his brother, telling him he must make ready to go down for Scotland, the time drawing near for his keeping the next session of their parliament, he would presently expede his commission, and upon such a day he must take journey. At which discourse the duke seemed to be much displeased, tell ing his majesty it was a thing he could not at all undertake at this juncture ; for he having a great trade at Calais and other foreign places, and many years' accounts to clear with these foreign factors, wherein he and other great merchants in the city were concerned, being now upon their journey, he must needs stay to clear with them, and therefore desired earnestly to be excused. To which the king replied, \" James, either you must go, or I must go.\" And speaking these words with a kind of question, the duke as brisk ly replied, \" He would not go ; \" and so took his leave. Then going home, and calling his friends and cabal, he told them what passed ; and that he perceived the king resolved to follow Allington's measures. After which, his cabal he trusted in"], [178, "160 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. resolved among themselves, that they would go to their houses, and put themselves in such a pos ture as that they might return within so many hours; no doubt, to such a secret place where they might sit without parting, until they had de feated the king's resolutions, and brought their purposes, if possible, to the intended issue. And if the information be true, which the event seems to make probable, they all unanimously resolved to begin with Allington, and see if they could take him off by poison ; which they did by brib ing his cook and master-household ; Avhich took place, and, if my memory fail not, says the rela tor, he either died on the Friday's night or morn ing.* For York had a spy to tell him so soon as ever his breath went out ; and the cabal re solved, that if the business took, the Duke of York should be the first that should carry the * \" In 1082, William, lord Alington of Killard, in Ireland, was created lord Alington of Wymley, in Hertfordshire.

And it is said that he made such haste, for fear any should be before him, that he ran to the court at the nighest, with one of his shoes down in the heel, and one of his stock ings untied. Yet he was prevented, for one of my lord's servants had just come in before him, and told that his master was dead suddenly, and undoubtedly poisoned. York coming in in the mean time, not hearing this, made his lamenta tion that Allington, his friend, was dead ; a very sad stroke to the court. \" Aye,\" says the king, \" and his servant thinks he was poisoned : I wish you have not a hand in it, of which, if I were sure, you should presently go to the Tower ; for I am like to be next.\" But the duke intreat ing his majesty to have no such thoughts, and, acknowledging his fault in refusing to go to Scot land at their last meeting, said, he was now resolv ed to comply with his majesty's commands, and take journey next week for Scotland, come of his business what would : And therefore desired his majesty to expede his commission next week, that he might not be hindered. Now these were the words that he and his cabal had concerted further to blind the king withal, that so they might bet ter effectuate their next resolution.

In the mean time, the duchess of Portsmouth, his present miss or whore, that the king of France had sent him, and who in fluenced him as she pleased to the French mea sures, not being pleased with the Duke of York's maltreating the king in refusing to go to Scot land, his cabal thought fit that the duke should go to her and acknowledge his rashness with the king, and beg that she would interpose for their amicable reconciliation, which she promised to do ; and telling her that, he being to go away upon Monday or Tuesday next to obey his ma jesty's commands in Scotland, the best way and time to do it was to sup with her grace on Sab bath night, and she might invite any of the court there that she thought fit ; to which she consent ed. When he came back, and told his cabal what was done, they said, \" Then our business is like to do.\" So they ordered the duke to send a good quantity of all sorts of wines and good liquors, especially claret, which the king loved ; that so she might be induced to entertain them liberally and long that night. And, the king being sotted with drink, it being usual, in such a case, to drink a good deal of coffee for a cure, they had liberally bribed his coffee-man to poison his coffee ; and some of York's faction, in that case, when he was so drunk, was to advise the duchess to keep him '2"], [181, "163 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. all night, to save him the trouble of going to his own room. Likewise knowing that, in the morn- ing, when he first awaked, he made use of much snuff\", they hired the duchess's chambermaid to put in the poisoned snuff into his box, and take out what was in it before. And so nothing- doubting but their design now would take place, they ordered a spy to give an account of his car- riage when he awaked, timeously, before any of the court should know of it. When he awaked he cried out \" he was deadly sick,\" and calling for his snuff-box, he took a deal of it ; but still growing worse, he sent for his servants to put on his clothes, which when they were doing he stag gered. So he got to the window, and leaned upon it, crying, \" I'm gone, I'm poisoned ; have me quickly into my chamber.\" The duke getting notice, came running in haste, all undrest, to lament his brother's fate, saying, \" Alas ! Sir, what's the matter ?\" who answered, \" O, you know too well,\" and was in great pas sion at him. In the mean time, he called for his closet-keeper to fetch him out an antidote against poison, that a German mountebank had given him and assured him it would instantly cure him whenever he suspected it ; but it could not be found, neither his physicians, being, as it was thought, sent out of town. When he saw all these things fail him, being enraged at his bro ther, he made at him ; but he having secured all"], [182, "164 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. the entries to the court, that the sentry should tell, if any courtiers or bishops, upon the news, should offer to come in to see how the king was. They were to tell them that he was gone to bed out of order, and had discharged all access to him that he might be quiet. And in the mean time the duke seeing him in such a rage, and that the poison was not like to do so quickly, set four ruffians upon him, at which he crying out so as he was heard, they presently choked him in his cravat, and so beat him in the head that he in stantly died. It is said that his head swelled big ger than two heads ; and also that his body stunk so with the poison and other things, that none could stay in the room. And it is said, that in the dead of the night they were forced to carry him out and bury him incognito. However the room was kept quiet, that none had access to the supposed sick king, as if he had been lying still in bed. None was admitted to that room but those who were true friends to York, who made the people believe he was still alive, but dangerously ill. And when his council met, and had concerted what measures to follow upon the supposition of his death, (an embargo being laid upon all ships for that time, that none might carry abroad the rumour of his sickness,) then they gave out the news of his being just now dead toward the latter end of the week ; and, as they had con certed in council, the duke of York was proclaimed"], [183, "165 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. king. One that was at court at this time, and was a friend of Monmouth's, brought him over this account, affirming it to be true. The duke of York was no sooner proclaimed king, but he sent over instantly an express to the prince of Orange, his good-son, to apprehend the duke of Monmouth, and send him over prisoner to England. It was a strange providence that the duke, upon the prince's invitation some months before, had gone up to visit him, and was that night in his lodgings when the express came. The prince being surprised with the news at first, upon second thoughts managed the business very well. He dispatched the express, and when all his household was gone to bed, he put on his nightgown, and went up to the duke of Mon mouth's bed-chamber ; and letting him see the surprising news, both with respect to the king and himself, he advised him to get up and go away before day-break, to any place where he thought he might be most secure, for he had no mind to meddle with him. Which he did, and came to Rotterdam before five in the morning, to his friend and factor's house, Mr. Washington's, who kept the great brewery at the sign of the Peacock, and, sending for several of his friends who were there, told them the strange news, asking their advice what was best for him to do. They, being all struck with amazement, knew not what advice to give him. He told them that"], [184, "166 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. the Marquis de Grana, governor of the Spanish Netherlands, being his intimate acquaintance at the English court, had by a message invited him up to divert himself a while with him at Brus sels. He thought now he was called to go there, since he was not admitted to stay where the prince of Orange had any power, lest it might beget a mistake between him and his father-in law. His friends thought it a good providence that he should take the occasion, which he did ; and going through several garrison towns which were in his way thither, with his camels, sumpt ers, and servants attending him, he was compli mented in his passage by the magistrates and go vernors of these places. But how strange is it to think, that some days ere he came there, there came a message and or der from the king of Spain to the marquis, giv ing him an account that, if he heard by this time of the king of England's death, he should take care to apprehend the duke of Monmouth, if he were in his territories. They were both sur prised at their meeting, and condoled one ano ther's fate ; the one that he had got such an or der, that, cost him what it would, he would not execute ; the other, that he should have come now to put him in such a lock. So in that very night he was forced to disguise himself, and one of his trustiest servants, in a common soldier's habit, and return again, sometimes by land and some-"], [185, "167 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. times by water, until he landed at Dort, where two spies, Englishmen, following them to the inn as suspected persons, the master going up stairs to a room, and his servant going into the cookery to see what meat was for eating, he heard them saying to one another in French, \" That fellow that went up stairs looked very like the duke of Monmouth.\" Upon which the servant took up bread and drink, paying for it ; and they went out by a back door, when they had done, and took a waggon, which brought them to Rotterdam ; where they told their friends what was befallen them. What is above said seems to make it very evi dent that the king's death was a fore-contrived thing. For if the king of Spain knew of it be fore his messenger was dispatched, as the story evinceth, so the popish princes in other countries could not but be acquainted also, as well as the papists in England ; for it seems to have been an universally laid thing, to hasten the duke of York to the crown of England for advancing the Catholic cause. After this, Monmouth was obli ged to lurk sometimes in Rotterdam, sometimes elsewhere, until they had perfected that concert of Argyle's coining into Scotland and Mon mouth's into England, where their friends in both nations promised to appear with them for retrieving, if possible, the protestant interest that was now perishing ; and their last meeting for that effect was at Rotterdam."], [186, "168 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. Here also, it is to be remarked, that the duke of York, now king of England, pursued Washing ton, as his factor, for receiving the crown jewels that the king gave to Monmouth ; but he not be ing able to make it good that Washington had received them, the pursuit fell, and came to no thing. Mr. Veitch, drawing nigher Newcastle, was in such strait that he was forced to betake himself to a wood ; these proclamations and penalties * put ting his friends in such a fear, that they durst not harbour him in their houses. The harvest-nights growing cold, he got some straw to lie on under him, and a great covering above him all night ; which was supposed by travellers, or any that saw it, to be the herd's, whose name was Thomas Wilson ; and, when Mr. Veitch went from the place of the wood where he used to be, upon the noise of travellers, so that the lass that brought him his meat could not find him, she was ap pointed to cry \" Tommy Wilson, Tommy ;\" upon the hearing of which he came and met her. When that storm was a little calmed, he ven tured in to Newcastle to see his wife and family ; where be met with some of his Scotch relations, that were come to see them, and inquire what was become of him. Some other good people in town also were there. They spent together a * See before, p. 150."], [187, "169 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. part of the night in prayer and mourning over the sad case that now the nations and church were in. * The most part of their discourse was telling their fears and discouragements, and that they were never like to see good days again. After several had spoke to that purpose, Mrs. Veitch came to tell her thoughts, \u2014 ' that, indeed, our night was dark, and all things looked with a black face, but yet she was persuaded that God would not leave his own work, but would raise up instruments from an airt that we did not ex pect, to build his house, to bring back the ark and the glory, and bring home his captives ; and she was persuaded that she would see presbytery esta blished, and her husband a settled minister, in the church of Scotland, ere she died.' Though they loved the thing, yet they little believed it in the time ; but when it came to pass, they both thought and talked much of it. Mr. Veitch, being wearied with such toil and confinement, went with one Caleb Wilkison, a Nottingham merchant and friend of his ; who carried him to that part of Yorkshire lying be tween York and Hull, and left him as a friend of his to stay in a town called South Cave, with one Mr. John Chappelle, a merchant there ; telling him quietly, that he was an honest man under hiding, where he was most kindly entertained. * Bennet, in his Memorial, (pp. 289 \u2014 291.) gives an account of some young men in Newcastle who were brought before Judge"], [188, "170 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. And there was in that town one Mr. Beak, their dissenting minister, that preached in Swan land Chapel, * but durst not at this time, the heat of Monmouth's business not being yet well cooled ; but some weeks being elapsed he began to venture. In the mean time, when the Sabbath came, his landlord, Mr. Chappelle, read and spake his thoughts upon the Scripture, (which is usual in England,) and prayed in the forenoon. And he would have Mr. Veitch, who now went under the name of Mr. Robinson, to do the like in the afternoon ; to which he was somewhat averse, but, being urged, did it. Next morning Mr. Chappelle comes to Mr. Robinson's bedside, and, after inquiring how he was this morning, he says, \" Truly, Sir, I have been in a mistake about you ; Jefferies in 1083, imprisoned for a year, and threatened with a trial for high treason, because they had subscribed a paper con taining rules for the better ordering of a society for prayer and religious conference, which they had taken from a work of Isaac Ambrose. \u2014 Richard Gilpin, M.

Mr. Benjamin Bennet succeeded Dr. Gilpin as minister at Newcastle. * Palmer (Memor. ii. 597.) mentions \" Mr. James Baycock,\" (corrected \" Bayock,\") as many years a preacher at South Cave, where he trained up several persons for the ministry.

He goes down to visit his minister, Mr. Beak, taking his guest along with him, and, tak ing him aside, tells him his thoughts concerning him. The minister was very kind, and they kept for several weeks a warm correspondence in pri vate, till the ministers fell a preaching again in their meeting-houses ; when Mr. Beak preaching in the forenoon, he and some others will have Mr. Robinson to preach in the afternoon. Some of the people of Beverly being at that sermon, had influenced the leading dissenters to send a horse and a letter, inviting Mr. Robinson to come down and give them a sermon ; which he was loath to do, but his landlord persuading him to it, did comply. Though there were many good people in it, and some of note, yet the mayor, aldermen, and Sir Ralph Wharton,* deputy-lieu tenant, were all high tories. However, the good people would have him to preach to them in a by-place of the town, called Paradise, walled about. They went in all before day broke ; but the country people, who came wandering in the * Sir Ralph Wharton \u2014 commissioner of supply for the east rid ing of the county of York in 1079 and 1090.

The mayor and aldermen compassed the house, and the mayor coming in with a ser geant at his back, the people rising to give him way, ere he came near the minister, he cried, \" Hold, hold ! Sir, enough of that ;\" and stepped to the end of the table next him, to lay hold on the paper that one was writing the preaching upon ; but, they struggling, he did not get it. In the mean time, all being on their feet round about him, and the mayor being sand-blind, so that he could not distinguish him from the rest, the minister was advised to turn about to the other end of the table, and go into another room on the same floor where the people were hearing. He put on his steel-grey riding coat, which was lying on the bedside, and sat down and heard the mayor abusing his neighbours for being there ; telling them that Monmouth was not as yet well cold in his grave, and they were beginning new plots against the government ; and many other things to that purpose. To whom Mr. Benja min Dalton, a rich man, and one in good esteem in the place, replied, \" Mr. Mayor, if you under stood yourself, and the station you occupy, you would not speak so rudely to us, and threaten us so hard with a prison ; we know what you can do in law, and, if you go beyond it, we know how to be redressed.\" Upon which, one of the aldermen came in, and called him out to the door,"], [191, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 173 and he, with the rest, chid him for his indiscre tion, and told him only to take up their names, and let them go till the court-day, where they would be called to pay their fines. Mr. Robin son was afraid when he heard of sending all to prison, thinking then that he would be discovered ; but when he heard of taking up names, he hoped that he might escape. The mayor came back with his clerk, and stood in the great entry, and the clerk took all their names as they passed by. Mr. Chapelle, Mr. Robinson's landlord, was the mayor's cousin german, and both were of one name. He thought fit to show himself to his cousin, the mayor, before his wife, and the minister, and the people that lived in that town should go out. When he came to him, he got up both his hands, and cried out, \" O, cousin, are you here ? I'm sure there is a deep plot on foot that you are come seven miles to carry on ; but, however, you may go, for I cannot forget your name if I mind my own.\" \" Nay,\" says he ; \"I have my wife, friends, and neighbours here, and I'll go fetch them all out together ;\" and, when he came back, he says to the minister, \" Come you next after me, and let the rest follow.\" When he passes by, the clerk writes down his name by the mayor's order. In the mean time, the mayor takes Mr. Robinson by the sleeve, and says, \" What is your name, Sir ?\" to which he replies, \" Mr. Mayor, my name is"], [192, "174 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. William Robinson.\" \" Where do you live ?\" This question being a little puzzling, he pulls at his landlord's coat, and he, understanding the strait he was in, turns about, and says to the clerk, \" Write down, William Robinson of Gilbert-dykes;\" and so they went out. But Mr. Robinson would go to no house, but desired his landlord to show him the next way out to the Windmills, and send his horse after him. He lay long among the bushes waiting, and seeing several horsemen coming by, he skulk ed behind a hedge lest they should be enemies ; but when they came nigh, seeing them friends, he asked, if they saw his boy and the horses coming. They said, \" No ;\" but one of them caused his son give him his horse, and he went along with them, and the young man waited for the minister's horse. So he went to that man's house, which was but two miles off the town, where he dined ; and, after preaching out his ser mon to a number of people that followed on that way, he went home at night with his landlord Chappelle. \"When the court-day came, the mayor sat to fine the people of the town, and Sir Ralph Whar ton those of the country, who most part appear ed, yet the preacher was not found ; but they fined him, according to the law, in \u00a320 Sterling, whose name and habitation was not yet known, whenever he should be found ; and if he be not,"], [193, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 175 to lay that fine upon the hearers proportionably next court-day. But some of them thinking that the minister might be that Robinson of Gilbert dykes, they ordered their bailiffs to go to that place, which was ten miles off Beverly, and bring him, with all the other absents in the country, the next court-day, which was to sit at twelve of the clock. The bailiffs went to the place, and hap pened to find a poor old man of that name, who was a hedger and ditcher, whom when they would bring away, he appealed to the next jus tice of the peace, where he gave his affidavit that he had never been in Beverly all his life, and that he was no dissenter ; which affidavit they presented to the court the next day ; and when it was read they fell all a laughing, and the mayor cried out, \" My cousin Chapelle has undoubted ly served us this trick.\" It is remarkable here, that more than an hour before, King James's act of indemnity, and his act for liberty to all dissenters to license meeting houses and ministers, where, and whom they pleased, and that only for paying sixpence to the next justice of the peace's clerk, were proclaimed at eleven of the clock at the market-cross in Be verly ; yet the court that sat after twelve were going to exact the fines for the minister and people. But Mr. Dalton, with some of the lead ing dissenters, went up to the Court, protested and took instruments in the hands of the clerk,"], [194, "176 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. that now their proceedings were illegal, seeing the acts of indemnity and liberty were proclaim ed before they sat down ; and they were forced to dissolve the court, so that neither minister nor people paid fines. Sir Ralph Wharton, meeting with Mr. Dalton, his physician, says, \" How now, Dalton ; you'll have a minister and a meeting-house, surely?\" \" Yes,\" says Mr. Dalton, \" as soon as possible ; and if we can, we will have Robinson of Gilbert dykes to be our minister, and then ye shall see him, though before you could not find him.\" It is to be remembered here, that Mr. Ro binson, after that meeting was taken, within a few days went straight to York, and Mr. Beak, the honest minister of Swanland, was pleased to accompany him, being born in that city, where he met with another remarkable deliverance. For Mr. Beak informing several of the good people of that city what he was, they would needs have him to preach private ly to them, the liberty not yet being come out.* * The king's Declaration for liberty of conscience in England was dated April 4, 1087. It suspended the execution of all penal laws in matters ecclesiastical, acquitted the subjects from all pe nalties which they had incurred, or might hereafter be liable to, for nonconformity, and freely gave them \" leave to meet and serve God after their own way and manner, be it in private houses, or places purposely hired or built for that use.\" \u2014 \" We cannot but heartily wish,\" (says his Majesty) \" as it will easily be believed, that all the people of our dominions were members of the Catholic"], [195, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 177 He lying at the Black Greyhound, near the Min- ster of York, a little before the time that the messenger was to come about him to the other end of the city where he was to preach, he went over to the minster-yard to get himself trimmed, and passed by a company of fine genteel sparks, who looked very wistfully to him as he was go- ing into the barber's shop, whom, by a good pro vidence, he found not within, and so returned to his quarters, and went away with the messenger that came for him about day-going. About the beginning of his sermon there came in a gentleman and his lady, with a great lantern before them, and sat down in the chairs hard by the preacher, that were set for them. After ser mon was ended, he and some others staid to talk with the minister, to whom he said, \" I perceive, Sir, you are a Scotch minister ; was you this evening in the minster-yard ? and saw you any sparks there standing ?\" \" Yes, I did,\" said the minister. Says the gentleman, \" One of them was a Scotchman, a Jesuit priest, who knew you, and thought to have resented some injury he says you did him. For as soon as he saw you, he made haste to get a warrant from the justice church ; yet we humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long time been, our constant sense and opinion, (which upon di vers occasions we have declared,) that conscience ought not to be constrained, nor people forced in matters of mere religion.\" (Wod row, ii.

Upon which, the master of the house where he was preaching said, he should lie with him all night ; and Mr. Beak should go to the quarters where they had lien together, which was his aunt's house, and should come by day breaking in the morning with the horses to that place, and convey him safely out at the gates, which he could well do, being born in the city, and accompanied him a mile on his way. He went toward Newcastle, to hear of his wife and family, and presently returned to Nottingham, there being no safety for him there ; for the in demnity and liberty forementioned was not pro claimed till he came to Nottingham. This Scotchman, who was now turned to be a Je suit priest,his name was Brown, born in Smail holm, near Kelso, who being new laureate, came to Mr. Veitch's house at Harnam Hall, in Northum berland, and lamenting his distressed case, would be content either to be a chaplain or schoolmas ter, or any thing he would recommend him to, for his livelihood.

But he refused, not only upon the account of his loose carriage here, but fear ing he might be worse afterward ; and also be cause some other young men that he had for merly recommended to these ministers in the city did neither answer his nor their expectation. However, this youth went to London, and fall ing in with a popish gentleman, attended his son abroad for several years, and returned to Eng land, as it was reported, under the character of a popish priest ; and haunting at York, (for it is like the popish gentleman was a Yorkshire one, which made him do so,) there it was that he first saw Mr. Veitch, and intended to give him the forementioned requital. But God, who had given him many former deliverances, added this also. Within a few days after he came there, a mes senger brought him a call from the people of Be verly to be their minister, which he complied with, though the people of Nottingham had an inclination to detain him. He sent back a letter with the messenger, telling them, that within eight or ten days he would wait upon them. Af ter his entry, the meeting grew daily more nu merous, which was occasioned by his going up to the wild places of Yorkshire, called the Wolds of"], [198, "180 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. Yorkshire, being invited upon week days to preach among them, and they licensing great leaths, or barns, for that purpose ; so that they came down from these places in companies to Be verly on the Sabbath. They had made a stately meeting-house, by throwing down all the divi sions of four great rooms on one floor ; and taking up the deals of the middle parts of the lofts above, and opening great windows to a yard of green ground, where hundreds of people may stand and hear. All sorts of people at first were anxious to hear ; and it can be said of several of them that came from such motives, they got better ones there. He was several times invited to preach at Hull, which is six miles off. The people declared that, to their knowledge, there never was such a refor mation in these parts. For the justices of the peace, especially those that were popish, were mightily incensed against it, and used all means to break it, especially his preaching in the Wolds ; where a popish justice of the peace, on a week day, came (having threatened before that he would do it) with a great company of hounds, and hunting horses, and long whips ; and called to the people that were standing without doors to hold out of their way, that they might see and hear that fellow, who came so boldly to debauch the country. But the people told them, that if they offered to do any thing indecent and dis turbing, or contrary to law, they would resent it."], [199, "181 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. upon which they retired. The minister had never more satisfaction in any part of his ministerial work than he had in that place. Having preached for six or seven months there, and settled a meeting-house and a people, the like whereof was not formerly, and which continues unto this day, September 1688, he was strong- ly invited, by many letters, to return to his na- tive land ; they having accepted also of king James's liberty, though they did it not so soon as in England. His wife was very forward for his re- turning, though the people of Beverly had sent for her, given her good offers, and used many ar- guments to persuade her and her husband to stay with them. But her heart was for her native country, and she longed to see that in the per- formance which she had promised herself formerly in her duties and wrestlings with God, and had expressed her assurance thereof. After he had left Beverly, one of the pleasant est cities, with two great and famous churches in it, curious and plain fields about it, therefore called the Paradise of England; and having preached his farewell sermon, where there were many tears, he, with a kind of reluctancy, took his leave of that beloved and affectionate people. In his way home he visited his friends at Darn toun, where he was persuaded to stay the next Sabbath. The few godly people that were theiv were earnestly desirous that he should stay a"], [200, "182 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. while with them, and that he should go out upon the week days and preach in the country about where he had been formerly acquainted, viz. at Matthew Scarfield's at Jolbee, about three miles south from Darnton, who was a very godly man ; at Mr. Smithson's, who lived to the westward four or five miles ; and at one Mr. Harrison's, who lived to the north-east several miles. Their im- portunity made him continue longer than he de- signed ; and though the people in Darnton could not, when he came there, promise a minister above L. 10 a-year, they not exceeding eighty hearers at first, yet in two months' time he brought them to about 400 or 500 out of the country round about, who did subscribe to give an honest minister L.60 Sterling per annum ; so that they were necessitated to make up a new meeting-house ; for the old place would not serve. And the people of Scotland being impatient for his coming, he left Mr. Long his successor to that people. After all these things, he at length, all impedi ments being removed out of the way, returned with great joy and affection to his native land ; the people in the parishes of Oxnam, Crailing, Eckford, Linton, Morebattle, and Hownam, hav ing joined together to give him a call to preach to them, under the present liberty,* at Whitton- In the Proclamation of February 12, 1687, commonly called"], [201, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 183 hall, which was almost the centre of these pa rishes, the most of the hearers being within three miles of the meeting-house which they there erected.

Upon this good news, and the prospect of a happy change, the outed presbyterian ministers of Scotland thought it expedient to meet at Edin burgh, and so wrote to all their brethren in the adjacent parts to meet at the Taylors' Hall, where they spent some time in praying together, that God would prosper the prince's undertaking, give him, and all that joined with him, counsel and direction how to manage so great and difficult an undertaking, and make them successful ; so as it might resolve to God's glory, returning of the captivity of the church and people of God, the building of the old waste places, and the bringing back of the ark and the glory that had been so long at Kirjath-jearim, the fields of the wood, and settle it again in his sanctuary ; and particularly that, at this juncture, he would point out to the godly ministry and people in Scotland what is their duty, and help them faithfully to perform it. It fell out, very unexpectedly and surprisingly to Mr. Veitch, that the meeting of the ministers voted him, the next day after he came, to preach in the new meeting-house over against Libbertons Wynd head ; a thing to which he was greatly averse. His reasons that he gave were \u2014 his being"], [204, "186 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. a stranger for twenty years and more in Scotland, and so very ill acquainted with the transactions of that time, which rendered him unfit at such a juncture to speak in public ; as also that there were many old, grave, and wise men there to do it, and it might bring no small detriment to such a promising work of reformation as was now in prospect to set him or such as he was in such a public place. But these reasons Avere not heard, and it was left upon him, which was so perplex ing to his mind that he knew not what to do, for when eight of the clock at night was come he could not find a text ; but at length he fell upon that 18th verse of the 119th psalm, (the words are, \" Thou hast trode down all them that err from thy statutes, for their deceit is falsehood,\") which took him up the whole night without going to bed in thinking upon it. And when he came up to the pulpit, his seeing of sixteen old ministers sitting in the loft before him, and the meeting so throng of all sorts of people, increased his fear and confusion. However, he delivered his thoughts upon the subject, with respect to the present circumstances of things and what was in view, with such plainness and freedom as greatly offended the prelates, who sent him a particular message the next day by one of their own gang and his acquaintance, \u2014 that for such bold and unbecoming reflections upon them and their go vernment they were resolved to be even with"], [205, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 187 him ere long ; as also, that he durst be so bold in such a public auditory to pray for the success of the Prince and Princess of Orange. All the answer he returned them by the messenger was, to bid them put on their spurs. Upon the other hand, he seemed to give offence to some of the godly party, by some free expressions that he had with respect to the future government, if presbytery should be erected. A worthy gentleman both for learning and piety took him by after sermon in the street, and told him, he doubted not but that he had offend ed several of the good people by some things he had said. He replied, he was sorry for it ; but a little time would discover these things. About half a year after he came to him at the cross of Edinburgh, and taking him aside, he craved him pardon for what he had said upon that ser mon, for all that was spoken in it was like to be too true. When the presbyterian church was restored by law, Mr. Veitch had calls from several parishes, viz. one to Crailing, another to Melrose, and a third to Peebles, which he was persuaded by the Earl of Crawford, Lord Argyle, old Stairs, and James Stewart, advocate, to embrace, notwith standing the old Duke of Queensberry did vigo rously and violently oppose it. But these four forementioned persons engaged to support him, telling that the duke and his iniquitous laws"], [206, "188 MEMOIRS OF AVILLIAM VEITCH. were now out of date, out of court, and un der water; but, notwithstanding of his being overclouded for the present, he got up again, and maintained a vigorous plea against Mr. Veitch for seven sessions, both before the lords and the church ; so that the gentlemen who pro mised to support him shrunk back as the duke increased in favour at court ; and at length he overawed, I may say, the church to loose him from that charge. And he having a call to Edin burgh, another to Paisley, and a third to Dum fries, the assembly was influenced by Mr. Veitch's speech, (wherein he showed so great an aver sion to Edinburgh) to vote him to Dumfries ; after he had served the cure four complete years in Peebles, viz. from September 1690 to Septem ber 1694, at which time he was admitted to his ministry in Dumfries. He left Peebles with great aversion, not only with respect to that parish, but also to the coun try round about. He did foresee that his re moval from thence would be of ill consequence both to the parish and the country-side, and, therefore, upon a new call given him to that place, struggled hard to be back again, and lost it only by four votes. He never got the legal stipend of that place all the four years he was there ; so that he lost, what by expence of law, and not getting the stipend which was legally due, above ten thousand merks, by the potency"], [207, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 189 of his enemies, and the injustice of the bench, which the old Duke, and his son Lord William,* have to account for to the Great Judge ; and, if Mr. Veitch be rightly informed, it did trouble the conscience of two of his greatest opposers on their death-bed. As Mr. Veitch was greatly perplexed with the hard usage the assembly had given him in their illegal removing of him merely to please the duke, when they had many strong reasons to the contrary, and to send him to Dumfries, a place that he heard wanted not its own difficulties, he resolved to leave the nation, and so publicly re fused to submit to the sentence of that judica tory, and undertook to give in his reasons for so doing. The assembly being about to rise, refer red him to the commission of the kirk to hear him, to whom he gave in a whole sheet of paper of reasons why he could not submit to the sen tence, with a complaint of his hard usage and unbrotherly treatment. After the reading of which, he being put out, and the commission con sidering the matter, instead of giving him writ ten answers which he required, they thought it better to appoint a committee to confer with him, to see if they could give him satisfaction ; * In 1693, Mr. Veitch lost an action before the Lords, against Lord William Douglas, the Duke's second son, for the reduction of a tack which his predecessor, Hay, had granted for behoof of his family. (Fountainhall's Decis. i. 879.)"], [208, "190 MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. and they nominated Mr. Edward Jamieson, Mr. Gabriel Semple, and his brother Mr. John, with some others, to confer with him and bring his answer to the commission. In the mean time his old friends in England, hearing of these things, sent a gentleman to Peebles to bring him back to them, engaging to give him a fine house and yards to dwell in, to furnish him with plenty of fire, and L.60 Ster ling per annum, well paid, beside other things which he knew they used to give ; and the gentle man promised to give his personal bond for the making all of it good before he went out of Pee bles, and would not return to England without Mr. Veitch's going along with him, which he did. They would have had Mr. Veitch engag ing to be their pastor ere he came back to Scot land, after he had preached a Sabbath day with them ; but he refused till once he should hand somely end with the commission of the kirk. When he came back to the commission, they having heard of these things, desired the com mittee forementioned to deal earnestly with him not to leave the nation, but to stay and comply with the sentence, if possible, and that because, among other reasons, it would be a very ill pre cedent, it being in the entry of this new reforma tion and church establishment, and give others afterward occasion to refuse submission to the sentences of church judicatories ; and they hoped"], [209, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 191 that Mr. Veitch, upon that very account, would be cautious and wary to do any thing that might afterward be prejudicial to the church, and de- sired him to do them that favour to go and preach at Dumfries four or five sabbaths, and acquaint himself with the people and the state of his af- fairs in that place, and see if he and they could comply together for his settlement, so as to prevent an early breach in the government, which would give much satisfaction to the commission. And indeed that had been in Mr. Veitch's thoughts before they proposed it, and was the knocking argument persuading him to obtemperate the sentence. And this was a great encouragement, that after several conferences with some leading- persons in the town, wherein he told them, among other differences needless here to be mentioned, that except they would free him of the drawing of the tithes (with which he had got on the finger- ends at Peebles, and \" burnt bairns fire dread\") and take a tack thereof from him as long as he should continue minister of the place, he could not settle among them, \u2014 they at length, consult- ing among themselves, complied with this ; and so he set them a tack of them so long as he was to continue their minister, at the rate that they often had told him the tithes were worth, viz. twenty-two hundred merks per annum, out of which he is obliged by charter from the king to pay the second minister 400 merks per annum.

Though the non-conformist ministers enjoyed considerable liberty in preaching during the last two years of the reign of James IL, yet it be hoved Mr. Veitch to act with great circumspec tion, as he was liable, if found on Scottish ground, to be seized in consequence of his banishment, and might be informed against as an accomplice o"], [212, "194 SUPPLEMENT TO THE of the Earl of Argyle. The Revolution reliev ed him from all apprehensions of danger ; and, while it enlarged the sphere of his usefulness, added in no small degree to his labours. The people in that part of the country where he had opened a meeting-house, were generally disaffected to the episcopal clergy, and embraced the first op portunity, on the change of the government, or rather on the inter-regnum, to forsake the bene ficed clergy, with their curates, and to flock to the tents of such presbyterian ministers as were within their reach. Although there were no tu multuous assemblies in the south, similar to what was called the rabbling in the west, yet many of the clergy, either apprehending something of this kind, or influenced by some other motive, desert ed their churches ; and others were soon after re moved from theirs, for adhering to the old, or re fusing to comply with the orders of the new go vernment. In these circumstances, and when there were neither ministers nor constituted au thorities to provide for vacant parishes, Mr. Veitch found himself, for a time, in the situation of the bishop of a diocese, and had to dispense divine ordinances to a whole country-side. His activity at this time, together with the distin guished part which he had taken during the late period of misrule and oppression, led him to be particularly noticed and abused by the advocates of that party who sought to embroil the nation,"], [213, "MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM VEITCH. 195 and who, for several years, kept two presses con- stantly employed in London, which teemed with pamphlets, containing accounts of the hardships of the outed episcopal clergy, and satires on the presbyterian ministers and the proceedings of their church courts. The object of that party was, by means of their friends in England, to prevent the court from agreeing to the estatmsh ment of the presbyterian church ; and, when they had failed in this, to obtain a legal and formal toleration of the episcopal church, under the wings of which they might carry on their plans for overturning the civil government and restor ing the exiled family. Speaking of the applications which the presby terian ministers, who temporarily served the va cant churches, made for an allowance from the le gal stipends, the author of one of the pamphlets above referred to, says : \" Thus Mr. William Veitch had been a great sufferer, for why ? he had been forced to appear actually in rebellion against King Charles II. at Pictland hills, for which he was not hanged indeed, but declared rebell and fugitive ; but now that the fields were fair, and he had endured so much undeserved persecution, would he not have been to blame if he had not studied his own interest?

He directed him to Provost Muir's ; and when he came and sat down and refreshed himself a little, he and some other strangers be gan to discourse about Teviotdale. The provost hearing asked, if he knew one Mr. William Veitch that lived there : he said, he knew him. He asked, if he was at home ; and he said, ' No, he is not at home.'

My hus band told them, ' they needed jnot to trouble them selves ; for they would not get him at home, nor yet to be their minister as he thought, for he had several calls in his own country.' The provost not knowing him, after some more discourse, asked at my husband, if he was the man they were seeking ; he told them, he was the man ; which made them both to wonder at that piece of providence.

They drew up a call and sent to him to the synod, where they condescended unto it, and my husband embraced it. But out of this pleasant rose there sprang many a thorn ; for both friends and foes were ready to reproach him, which was a trouble to my spirit, to see the people one day idolize him, and on another day reproach him, because he would not stay with them. I went to God with these words which David went with, ' Help, Lord, for I am be- come a reproach unto them. Let them curse, but bless thou, and let them know it is thy hand, and thou hast done it.' It was my desire to God that he would show the gospel a token for good to Peebles, that they that hated it might see it and be ashamed. But the cloud grew thicker and darker ; for Queensberry and his chamber lain were great enemies. They came all that length as to print a number of lies against the presbytery and my husband, because they could not get in one Mr. Knox, who was a curate. The presbytery had placed him, according to the act of parliament, so that his enemies could find no blame in it.

It was natural for the presbytery to inquire into this before his admission at Peebles ; and the following is the account of that matter in the minutes. Mr. Veitch, being desired to produce due testimonials of his ordination to the ministry, answered, \" that the hazard and danger was such at the time of his ordination, that it was not thought fit by his ordainers to grant testificates, but promised to bring a testificate from a famous minister's hand, now in Scotland, who was one of that number who gave him ordination; upon which the presby- tery, considering how well known he was in this country, and that he had been admitted and own- ed as a minister by the general meeting of this church, did rest satisfied.\" f I have no doubt that Mr. Henry Erskine is the person from whom he offered to procure a certificate.

Their dissatisfaction was increased by various measures which were subsequently adopted by the ecclesias- tical judicatories, in concert with or under the in- fluence of the court; particularly, the refusal to approve of the laudable steps of reformation in for- mer times, and to condemn the deviations from them ; the loose terms on which many of the epis- copal clergy were received ; the encroachments made by the court on the liberty of the church in the appointing of fasts and thanksgivings, and in the calling and dissolving of assemblies ; and the imposition of different oaths on ministers and preachers, as qualifications for office. $ These sentiments were entertained by several minis ters in the synods of Dumfries and Galloway, within whose bounds there were also many peo ple connected with the United Societies, who * Records of the Presbytery of Dumfries. t Acts of Assembly.

Another peti tion, presented by four ministers, for subscribing the directory and covenants, along with the con fession of faith, was referred by the synod, in October 1708, to the general assembly.* Simi lar proposals for renewing or subscribing the national covenants continued to be made at a still later period, in several presbyteries and synods, in the west and north of Scotland.f Even the statesmen, cautious as they were, had at one time nearly engaged themselves unwittingly in the pro moting of that design. In the year 1696, on the alarm produced by the discovery of a plot for as sassinating King William, and by a threatened in vasion from France, the privy council of Scotland proposed the subscription of a bond of associa tion by all well-affected subjects. Coming to the knowledge of this, the inhabitants of the western shires immediately drew up a bond, in which, to the engagement to defend the government, they added a clause respecting the defence of presby tery.

It is pretty evident, from the manner in which he conducted himself in this quarrel, and especially at the last stage of it, that his temper and mental faculties had be gun to suffer in no small degree from his advanced age.

The which desire I at length obtain ed, and after that, resolved never to return to those hirelings ; and so I continued to hear ho nest ministers ever after that, as I could have op portunity ; but without that desired effect that I looked for, depending more upon the instruments than upon the God of ordinances, so that my trouble rather increased than decreased. None can tell how I was tortured and perplexed by Satan's temptations. So I became very desirous to have imparted my mind to some honest mini ster concerning my case ; but being bashful and also simple, I could hardly adventure to do it, 'till once upon a day, a very worthy, famous, godly minister, (Mr. James Kirton) was in my master's shop reading the news, and I resolved to follow him, and impart my mind to him as I could ; and following him through the street, I was se veral times resolving to touch his shoulder, but had not the confidence, and so I parted from him as he entered his own house. And I went away with a grieved heart, and went to the north side of the Castlehill, near the loch, where I bemoaned my case before God as I could. And I can never enough wonder at the admirable providence of God, that kept me back from imparting my mind to him ; for upon the Sabbath following, I was led"], [288, "270 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. to hear him preach, who was, indeed, sent from God to me, and was made to speak out my case in every particular, as though I had written down my mind to him in every circumstance ; and he made such free offers of Christ, as made me to see him a complete Saviour, able to save to the very uttermost all that come to God through him. And I must say, (to the eternal praise of my God be it spoken !) that my very heart and soul were made to close with him in the offers of the gospel ; for by the power that came along with the word the Lord opened my prison-doors, and in a great measure he proclaimed liberty to a captive, and made his power to be known to wards me ; so that I was made to wonder at his surprising love and goodness towards such a wretched sinner as me. After that, I kept close by the ordinances, and found the word sweet and refreshing to my soul ; for the word of God was precious in those days, and there went a converting power alongst with it. After that, I was not without many assaults from the enemy of man's salvation ; but I bless the Lord, who stood by me and supported me. These days were the sweetest that ever I had upon the earth, and I hope they were days of espousals. After this, when Satan saw that he was disap pointed of getting me brought to utter despair of the mercy and goodness of God, he stirred up"], [289, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 271 outward troubles against me, to have me deprived of the precious ordinances, which were the very food of my soul ; and set my master against me, who would not suffer me to go to hear the Lord's servants, who preached then privately and on peril of their lives. My master was of a good natural temper, but fear of bringing himself to trouble, because of the dangerousness of the times, made him send for my father and uncle, to deal with me to forbear going to those conventicles, lest I brought trouble both upon myself and him. * And so my father came to town, and sent for me to my uncle's, and gave me a very sore onset, telling me, that \" the love and affection he carried to me as his only son, made him much concerned in me.\" He told me, \" he expected better things of me, than that I should both bring trouble upon myself and master, by leaving thfe church, and following after men that were not allowed by law to preach ;\" and there- * His master's fears were not groundless. To hear, as well as to preach, was made a crime by the act of Parliament Against Sepa ration in 1663, (Wodrow, i. Append, p. 79,) and imprisoning or fining the servant behoved to interfere with the master's accommo dation. But matters did not rest here. Even before the rising at Pentland, a proclamation was issued for obedience to ecclesiastical authority, (Oct. 11, 1666,) whereby heritors and masters were made responsible for their tenants and servants ; and if the former did not oblige the latter to conform, they were \" liable to the same pains and penalties due to the contraveners.\" True, this was a vigour beyond the law, but that was no way unusual at that pe riod.

However, though I was but young, (about 20 years of age,) the Lord helped me to make a very good reply. I said, \" Father, I am sorry to hear such words coming from you ! Indeed, if you had found me guilty of any vice, (such as cursing, swearing, sabbath breaking, stealing, or uncleanness,) you would have had good ground to disown me as your son. But seeing the Lord has kept me from these things, and that all that ye have to disown me for, is hearing the gospel preached by his sent servants, when I can have opportunity ; and, seeing this is the only quarrel, I cannot help it : for I am firmly resolved to hear the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ preached by his faithful ambassadors, cost what it will, through' the grace of God, although ye should disown me :\" \u2014 which words did so affect the heart of the old man, that he gushed out in tears, and said, \" God forbid ! my dear bairn, that ever I should hinder you from going where you may get most good for your soul.\" And so Satan was frustrated of his design ; for I continued hearing the gospel till the end of my apprenticeship, which was two years and a half after this, * carrying as obliging ly to my master as I could. * The year 1672, or thereabout, being the 23d year of his age."], [291, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 273 Then, about the end of my apprenticeship, it pleased God to remove my father by death ; and I was called to stay with my mother, to oversee her servants and other affairs, by which I was much deprived of hearing the gospel, which was my great grief and trouble. A little after I came home, there was a procla mation issued out, that all heritors, their tenants, and subtenants, should subscribe a bond,* that they should never go to any of the rendezvous of rebellion, (as they termed the meetings of God's people,) nor entertain any of these vagrant preachers, (as they termed the servants of the Lord,) whereupon our landlord, who was one of the Lords of Session, sent through his officer, and warned all the tenants of the barony to com pear at a court holden at his own house. My mo ther being warned amongst the rest, I was afraid lest she, through the weakness, should have com plied with the wicked decree. I desired that she would let me go, and I would answer for her ; and so I went.

Being there a considerable time before the bailie and the clerk came, we three took all the pains we could upon the rest of the tenants, to dissuade them from taking that bond ; and told them the hazard of taking thereof ; that it was a binding themselves from hearing the gospel preached by any of the Lord's sent servants, and that they durst not give them a night's quarters, nor a meal of meat, though they were starving at their door. This seemed to affect the men, and they said, \" God forbid that ever they should do such a thing !\" But alas ! they were soon dung * from that ; for so soon as the court was fenced, my Lord said, \" Sirs, I will tell you for what I have called you together ; the King has put forth a proclamation, that none within the kingdom should go to these rendezvous of rebellion, nor reset any of their ministers.\" And told them, that he himself had subscribed it at Edinburgh, and that they be hoved to do the same ; and solemnly protested that there was no evil in it, otherwise he would not have desired any of them to take it. \" And for your encouragement I shall subscribe it again before you all ;\" f which he did, and after, said, * driven. + Officers of state, at this period, were not scrupulous in sub scribing and swearing oaths; and with men destitute of principle, such bonds serve any purpose but that of supporting a government, or throwing out worthless individuals.

He answered, \" My name is Alexander Wedderburn, I am a tenant under John Brown.\" Whereupon my Lord says, \" John Brown, does speaking of the declaration 1662, observes, \" The great design of that act was to incapacitate the Earl of Crawford from being trea surer, and Lauderdale from being secretary ; but Lauderdale laughed at these contrivances, and told them he would sign a cart ful of such oaths before he would lose his place : and though Crawford was thereafter turned out of his office, yet Middleton missed it ; and thus we see how God disappoints such as endea vour to ensnare their native country with unnecessary oaths and engagements.\" (Hist, of Scotland, p. 64.)

Scot. viii. 231, 298.) That same year, on the 7th of November, Mr. Robert Martin, clerk of the criminal court, having declined swearing the test, (see before, p. 93,) Mr. Thomas Skene was installed in his room. He was deprived of his offices before the Revolution, and subse quently to that change, practised as an advocate, when his private affairs appear to have been in disorder.

He told me he had procured my peace with Mr. Skene, and therefore I might bring home all my goods that were dispersed; and desired me to live as quietly as I could. Accordingly, I brought home all with more confidence, and did lie more securely in my own house. But within a little while, the same Skene or dered a party of foot, under the command of one Lieutenant Inglis, * to come and apprehend my self, and missing me to drive my goods. And so he marched out of Edinburgh at night, thinking to apprehend me in my bed ; and, to make the more dispatch, they went to Gilmerton, and took horses to ride upon, and a guide to conduct them. However, I had a friend who lived there, who * Several individuals of the name of Inglis appear to have been noted among the military who scourged the country at this period. A captain Inglis was guilty of great cruelty in the parish of Kil bride, in the year 1682. (Wodrow, ii. 244.) Cornet Peter Inglis, son of captain John Inglis, is celebrated in the annals of barbarity and crime. (Wodrow, ii. 509 ; Scots Worthies, App. p. 47.) But the person referred to in the text is \"Archibald Inglis, a com mander under Hallyards,\" (the brother of Thomas Skene,) whose pillaging and cruelties in the parish of East Monkland are describ ed by Wodrow, (ii. 244-5.) Blackader mentions \" a party of dra goons, commanded by one lieutenant Inglis, who kept garrison in Midcalder, of purpose to suppress these meetings,\" and who dis persed a conventicle at the Black Dub in Bathgate parish, where James Davie was killed. (Chrichton's Mem. of Blackader, p. 171.) From Wodrow (ii. 432,) it appears that Thomas Kennoway, after wards cut off at Swine-abbey, was active in the attack on this field-meeting.

So he mounts upon a horse that they had left, and made all haste to give me warning. He, knowing the way some better than they, came by them in the night time, it being a thick fog. When he came to the house where I lived, he heard their tongues a little behind him, and so came to the chamber-window where I was lying, and called two or three times, \" Make haste and get away, for there is a party at hand to apprehend you.\" I was fast asleep, but hearing a voice, I got up hastily and came to the window, but he was gone. I heard his horse's feet riding through the close, for he durst not stay, they were so near. I made haste and put on my breeches, and took the rest of my clothes in my arms. One of the servant lasses that lay in the hall heard the man's words. She cried earnestly to me, to make haste, or then I would be taken. So I got to the back of the yard ; and before I had well on my clothes, they were all about the house, guarding both back and foreside. But, through the good providence of God, I escaped out of their hands, and got into a wood that was hard by the house, where I was safe. * The names of several persons in Carrington and the immedi ate neighbourhood are in the fugitive-roll given by Wodrow, vol. ii. app. p. 119.

There was one that they abused more than the rest, and dragged him by the hair of the head to a pool of water, where they threatened to drown him, if he would not tell them whether or not I was in the house the night before ; for not knowing that I had made my escape, but think ing I was hiding in the house, he would not tell them, lest he should have been accessary to my taking. And when they had brought him back from the pool, they stood with drawn swords at his breast, swearing they would run him through, if he would not tell. But they prevailed nothing with him. And then they made a diligent search ; and when they could not find me they began their spoil. And, first, they seized a chest, where my clothes and papers lay, which they seized upon. There were only fifty merks of money, which Inglis put in his pocket ; and then went to the fold and seized upon sheep, oxen, and all that was in the folds ; and after that, packed up sheets and blankets, and all the furniture of the house, as much as loaded several horses. And when they had set sentinels, and made all secure, they caused make ready breakfast ; and after that went away with horses, cows, oxen, sheep, and all that they could conveniently carry away with them.

After this I was made to wander up and down. My uncle and sister caused shear* the crop. And, after it was disposed of, I, paying off all debts I was owing, went into Edinburgh, and took a house ; resolving, with what little money was left, I would fall a trading privately, and so went once to London, and another time to Newcastle. But I was soon deprived of this design, times growing still worse and worse. It came to this, that none might set a house, or entertain or con verse with any that were in my circumstances, but they were reputed to be as guilty as we were. Whereupon I was necessitated to leave the coun try, with many others, lest we should bring trouble upon our friends. Then I went and remained at London for two years,f but did not agree with the air ; took the ague, and after that a sore flux, which continued long with me, and brought me exceeding low. When I parted with my friends at Edinburgh, they were very pressing with me that I would write to them, to let them know how I was, which accordingly I did, which proved hurtful both to myself and them. * reap. t He probably went to London in April or May 1683."], [310, "292 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. There were two other young men that went up in the ship with me who were both in my circum stances. We all three wrote home at one time, to let our friends know how it was with us ; which letters we sent with a young gentleman that came up passenger in the ship with us. After he went from London he was detained by con trary winds at Gravesend, and before he came to Scotland there was something broke out which was called Monmouth's Plot, so that all ports were stopped, and passengers searched for letters. Whereupon the gentleman was apprehended and brought before the council of Scotland, and cleared himself by his oath that he knew nothing of us, but that we went up passengers with him in a ship for London. But when our letters were read before the council, and our names found to be in the Porteous roll,* our friends were seized upon and carried to prison, and next day were examined. The Lords alleged we were concerned in the plot ; and especially, because of one expression I had in my letter to my sister, which was, after several exhortations for her to keep God's way, I said, \" Though there be a sore scattering among God's people, yet I hoped the Lord would bring them together again, for there was a work upon the wheels which would tend to the glory of God and * This was a list of the persons indicted to appear before the justiciary court."], [311, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 293 the good of his people.\" So our friends were continued in prison a considerable time, and at length, through moyen, came out upon bail. O ! how grieving was this to us. But that which made it still more weighty was, that we had desired our friends, when they wrote to us, to direct their letters to us, to be left at a very worthy Christian man's house, one John Brown, who lived near Bow Church-yard. And so the council had written up to court to apprehend three rebels, (as they were pleased to term us,) who were to be found in that man's house ; where- upon, they sent to apprehend us, but we did not lodge there, and neither did the honest man know any of us by our names, we using only some- times in his house to take a glass of cyder, he being a Scotsman. However, he was brought be- fore the king and council. He told, he knew none of us. He was ordered, upon his oath, either to apprehend us, if we came to his house, or return to prison. This being straitening to the honest man, he was returned to prison, until he took advice of friends what to do. Their ad- vice was, for him to send word to us not to come near his house, assuring us of our hazard ; and then he did comply with what was demanded of him. After he came out of prison, he knew not how to get us informed what was done against us ; but being informed at court of our names, and that we were lately come from Scotland, he made"], [312, "294 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. diligent search for us amongst all Scotsmen that he knew. At length he happened upon one John Whyt, who had lately come from Scotland, who was also in our circumstances, who knew us ; and he desired him to make diligent search for us, and inform of our hazard, and to desire us not to come to his house, for if we did, he was obliged to apprehend us. And likewise to tell us what was befallen our friends in Scotland upon our account. This man made search for us several days, and at length found us at a Scotsman's house about two miles from the city ; who, when he had found us, was very glad, and gave us a relation of the whole matter, which was very afflicting to us all. So we kept ourselves out of the city a considerable time, till I and one of my comrades fell sick, and came and lodged privately in the city. After my recovery from my long sickness, I began to think I had now spent considerable part of the money I had brought along with me ; and I began to speak to friends to see if they could wish me to any employment. There was an honest man that made it his business to lay out himself for me, and at length found out a family which was a very easy service, but some what difficult for one in my circumstances to engage in.

He was great in favours with the king, and also with the duke of York. This colonel had a good woman to his lady, that kept none in her family but dissenters : * she being informed of me sent * Several instances occur of shelter being found for the perse cuted in such situations as the above. Previous to the civil wars, while Dr. Scott, dean of York, was employed at cards or other games, to which he was much addicted, Mrs. Scott was attending a conventicle in another room ; the dean's house being reckoned the safest place for holding such assemblies. (Brook's Lives of the Puritans, iii. p. 528.) Tradition has handed down a similar account of Chancellor Rothes's lady. She used to frequent conventicles at Glenvail, and supported several of the persecuted ministers. The Earl, on her account, winked at them, and was in the habit of saying, when he happened to see any of them about the house, \" My lady, I would advise you to keep your chickens in about, else I may pick up some of them.\" Forty individuals having been taken into custody for a conventicle in Glenvail, were brought before the Earl of Rothes at Leslie, and he was asked what was to be done with them : \" Put them (said he) in bailie Walker's back-room, the place they all like so well.\" The bailie was a religious man, and his back-room was often occupied as a place of social prayer. When the Earl was asked what farther commands he had about them, he answered, \" Give them plenty of meat and drink, and set them about their business in the morning.\" The following anecdote of Crawford of Powmill is given on the same authority. A party of soldiers came one day to apprehend a neigh bour of his, a tenant at Pittendriech. The man, who was build ing a stack, threw down his fork and ran to Powmill, and meeting the laird, implored him for shelter, crying, Where shall I run ? \" O, never fear !

When I came to her, she told me, she had got an account of me that I was an honest man, and it was such she wanted. And told me all the circumstances of the family ; and that I might have as much liberty upon the sabbath-day as I desired, because her husband, by reason of his infirmity, always kept at home on the sabbath day ; but that he had no liking to dissenters, but I might be there long enough in his company, be fore he understood what my principles were. So we agreed for six pounds per year, and a suit of clothes ; and all I had to do was to wait upon this old gentleman, who was past seventy years of age. I entered home, and pleased my master exceeding well ; for he took much delight in his garden, and I encouraged him as much that way as I could, it being a harmless divertisement. He was very temperate : only his garden, the cof fee-house, and the king's court were the most part of his exercise ; and then I became a courtier, having him constantly to attend, because of his infirmity. I became very great in his favours, for in a short time I could answer him by signs, which were shorter than writing, which pleased him very well ; so that he mounted me all new, and bought me a fine walking sword. The man was rich, and had no children. I had both his kindness and my lady's. So I began to build a paradise to myself, which I was soon frustrated of, my master and I being warned tocompearand"], [315, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 297 take the oaths. So soon as my lady heard there- of, she called for me, and said, \" Woe is me ! for I fear this oath will discover you ; for if once your master knows your principles, he will keep you no longer.\" She told me the nature of the oath, and said, \" If ye have freedom to take it there will be no hazard.\" I told her I had no freedom to take it, for if I had been clear for taking such oaths, I might have staid in my own country. Then she said, \" I fear your master will be your greatest enemy.\" And then she began to give me her advice what to do : and that was to convoy my master to the court, where there would be a great crowd of people, so that I might shift him among the throng, and when the court was over, to wait for him at the door of the house, and he would not know but I had taken it. My master, being zealous for taking the said oath, rose more early that morning than ordinary, and called me to go alongst with him. We came to the place, and were with the first ; the justice, and clerks, and constables being come, and but a few others. Whenever my master entered the house, and I saw so few, I withdrew and went away. The justice, seeing me come in with the colonel, said to the constables, \" Call the colonel's man, who is going away, and bring him back to take the oath.\" I heard him give the orders, but I went fast away. However, the two constables ran after me, and overtook me, and brought me back. The justice"], [316, "298 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. said, \" Sir, why do you go away before ye take the oath ?\" I said, \" I came to conduct my mas ter, but not to take any oath.\" He said, \" But ye shall take it before ye go.\" He said, \" There was none that would refuse it.\" I told him I was but a stranger, and knew not the nature of their oaths. He said, \" I shall cause read it to you.\" After it was read, he said, \" What think ye of it?\" I desired time to consider it, till the next court day. He said, \" Ye shall have no longer time to consider it.\" If I would not take it presently I should immediately go to prison. And so he sent to call another justice, to concur with him, in sending me to prison. So I was brought within the bar. The colonel, sitting beside the justice, having taken the oath, asked, what was the reason why his man was brought within the bar as a prisoner. They wrote to him, (knowing his infirmity) that I had refused to take the oath, and that I desired time to consider of it, for I was a stranger. Then my master pled strongly for me, saying, \" I was a stranger indeed ; a north countryman, that understood not an oath.\" But, said he, \" Give him liberty till next court day, and my life for it he will take it, for he is a true church-of-England-man.\" However, he could not prevail, till an answer came from the other justice that he could not come at present. Whereupon, he demanded my name, and I told him. He said, \" If the other 2"], [317, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 299 justice had come, ye should surely have gone to prison, but seeing he has not come, go your way, in regard ye are the colonel's man ; but resolve with yourself to take it against the next court day, or ye shall surely go to prison !\" I gave a bow, and so came away.* * It does not appear what oath or oaths Brysson was required to take ; but when Mr. Frazer of Brae was apprehended at London, in 1683, the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and the Oxford oath, were all put to him. (Wodrow, ii. 289.) The English oath of allegiance was much less exceptionable than the Scot tish, having been drawn up by James I. to meet, if possible, the views of the Roman Catholics, whom he was very desirous of attaching to his government. The Scottish oath consisted of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy blended together. Those who wish to be acquainted with the reasons on account of which Pres byterians scrupled to take it, both in relation to the civil part, (as involving a renunciation of what the parliament had done in be half of its privileges and the liberties of the nation between 1640 and 1650,) and in relation to the ecclesiastical part of the oath, may see them stated at large by Brown, in his Apologetical Rela tion, sections 10th, 11th, and 14th. Complicated and ensnaring as it was, the rulers pressed this oath with the utmost rigour. It was imposed on all who were in any public employment, civil, military, or religious. At every meeting of the circuit, the mem bers of the court of justiciary, down to the macers, were made anew to swear it, or the test, and sometimes both. On such oc casions great crowds of people, accused of absenting themselves from church, attending conventicles, harbouring rebels, &c. and whose names had been taken down by the local magistrates, or the ministers of parishes, were summoned : if they agreed to take the test, they were dismissed as persons who had transgressed the law in ignorance ; and if they refused it, though willing to swear the allegiance, they were fined, imprisoned, put in the juggs, or banished to the plantations. (Minutes of the Circuit Court in Dumfries-shire, &c. in the Register House.) \u2014 In the year 1674 the privy council ordered a rendezvous of the militia"], [318, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 300 My master, seeing me liberated, came to me, and said, \" Woe is me, George, ye was almost a prisoner to-day ; however, let us go to the coffee house, and let me know your mind.\" So when we came to the coffee-house, he said, \" I hear ye refuse to take the oaths. I have so much kind ness for you, that if you had told me ye had not freedom to take them, I would not have brought you alongst with me this day.\" That which is most remarkable, We were not well come from the court, when the other justice came, and asked, what he was sent for. The other told him, that there was a man, whom regiment in the shire of Stirling, that the officers and soldiers might take the oath of allegiance before receiving their arms. This having produced a mutiny, the council ordered \u00a360, \" out of the fines,\" to be paid to the troop for their service, and a gratuity of \u00a3100 to the laird of Alva, the lieutenant-colonel, \"in consider ation of his wound received,\" in suppressing the mutiny. Cor poral Rae and others were imprisoned; and four individuals, tenants and \" sojors of the militia regiment,\" were banished \" for refusing the oath of allegiance.\" (Record of Privy Council, for July 21, Sept. 2 and 29, and Dec. 17, 1674.) \u2014 So zealous were the clergy for the ecclesiastical part of the oath, that they em braced every opportunity of recognising the king as head of the church, a title which never had been given to the sovereign in the Scottish oath of supremacy, nor in that of England since the ac cession of Elizabeth. \" Oct. 10, 1683.

He told, I was gone. He asked, if he knew my name ; for \" I fear he is one of the Scots rebels.\" He said, \" The clerk has his name.\" When he knew it, he took out the Porteous roll, (which he had,) wherein he found my name, and said, \" He is one of them.\" Whereupon, an order was pre sently issued out for apprehending me. The order was given to the constables to go next morning and apprehend me. There was a gen tleman in the court, who had formerly been a servant to the colonel, and heard the orders given out against me, who came immediately to my master's house. We not being come home, he asked my lady, if the colonel had a servant that had refused the oaths. She said, \" I fear it may be so.\" Then he told her, there was a war rant out to apprehend me. So when we came home, my lady took me apart, and asked how matters went, and I told her what had happened, and how my master took my part ; for he said to me in the coffee-house, (after I had written my mind to him,) that he was afraid they would come and apprehend me, which would be great trouble to him, to have me apprehended in his house. When my lady heard this, she was much troubled, and said, \" Indeed there is a war rant out to apprehend you!\" This was in the"], [320, "AIEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 302 evening. She said, \" I am much afraid ye may be surprised, for the warrant is given out against to-morrow ; therefore, I desire ye would rise early in the morning, and make your escape.\" Which, accordingly, I did. My lady was up in the morn ing betimes, and was pleased to bestow a compli ment upon me, besides what I had received from her husband : so we parted with grief on both sides ; and so I was in my old condition again. All this time I bad longings to be at home in poor Scotland, where I thought there was most of the life and power of the gospel ordinances. Sometime after that, major Henderson * came to me, and told me he had a letter from a friend in Holland, that Monmouth was coming over to England, with a body of men and arms, and that Argyle was going for Scotland, and hoped the Lord would make use of them as instruments for delivering his poor oppressed people ; and that * The name of James Henderson appears in a list of persons chosen for general officers at Shawhead-muir, June 1 7, before the battle of Bothwell. (Wilson's Bothwell, in Collection of Lives, &c. p. 93.) James Henryson, son to Thomas Henryson, in Westertown of Inglistown, Edinburghshire, is in the fugitive roll after that engagement. A person of the same name was a major in Argyle's expedition, (Wod. ii. 532,) and was tried for treason in absence, along with Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchen breck, &c. and sentenced to be executed.

We had great dif ficulty in getting over ; all persons being chal lenged at all sea-ports that went either out or in. The major being acquainted with a Dutch skipper, who trysted him, and those that were to go alongst with him, to be at Gravesend upon the day before king James was crowned, that so we might set sail on the coronation day, * on which we would be least taken notice of, most part of people go ing to London to see the Coronation. He was resolved to put us aboard in the night time. And so, accordingly, we came down by water. The major went to the place appointed by the skipper, and ordered us to stay in the boat till he came again ; but behold, the ship was detained at Lon don, upon the account of her cocket ! Then we knew not what to do. However, we resolved to brisk it out the best way we could ; and inquir ed for the best tavern in the town, and caused carry our cloakbags there, resolving to stay till to-morrow, to see if the ship came down the river. So we called for a bottle of wine, and drank with the landlord, and told him, we were to stay all night, having some business to do. He said, we should be very welcome. * James was crowned on St. George's day, the 23d of April, 1685."], [322, "304 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. We desired him to cause make ready dinner for us. He asked, what we would have. We de sired him to make ready a good dinner, for we were hungry. And, in the mean time, we spared not the wine, on purpose to keep ourselves from being suspected. In the evening the major stept out, to see if the ship were come ; but no appearance of her. He heard of another ship to sail for Amsterdam on the morrow; so he went to the skipper, and de sired to know, what time he would sail. He said, \" To-morrow at ten o'clock.\" The major earnest ly desired him to stay till four in the afternoon, and there were seven passengers that would go alongst with him. He said, he would not stay so long for any man ; but if we would make ourselves ready by one o'clock he should stay that long ; and if we were not ready peremptorily by that time he would leave us. This we did, that we might not be detained on board after we came to the ship, but that the ship might sail immediate ly, lest we should be challenged. On the mor row we caused our landlord make ready dinner sooner than ordinary, and then called for a reckon ing ; and after dinner drank heartily with the landlord. He saw us so hearty, he would needs give us his bottle. By which time the skipper came, and said, \" Gentlemen, if ye ben't ready, I will stay no longer for you.\" So we caused carry our cloakbags on board, and desired"], [323, "305 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. the skipper to loose anchor, and cause the boat wait for us, for we would come immediately ; which accordingly he did. We stayed till we were sent for again. The boy told us the ship was now under sail, and if we came not present ly we would be disappointed. Whereupon we ventured out, and went into the boat, and no man ever questioned us, and were safely put on board, and sailed to Amsterdam with a very fair wind, and were kindly received. [On receiving intelligence of the death of Charles IL, several Scottish gentlemen who had been ba uished, or forced to withdraw to Holland, by the severities of the time, met in Rotterdam to con sult concerning the state of their native country, and their own duty in that critical juncture of affairs. After a free communication of sentiments, they were unanimously of opinion that, consider ing the natural temper and past conduct of the Duke of York, and the principles of the religion to which he was devoted, his succession to the im perial crown of the three kingdoms threatened their religion and liberties with the most immi nent danger ; and that the behaviour of the par liaments for a course of years, with the means used to pack and manage them, and the ease with which he could raise a numerous army among the barbarous and bigoted natives of Ireland, would render it easy for him to \" carry on his terrible work of settling and rivetting popery and slavery x"], [324, "306 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. in, and eradicating Christianity and liberty, (the chief blessings of a society) out of these nations ; at least, would make the means of preventing these great and imminent dangers more narrow and scarce, and the practice more difficult and danger ous.\" Being also agreed and satisfied as to the obligation that lay upon them, as Christians and as natives of Scotland, \" to endeavour the rescue, defence, and relief of their religion, rights, and liberties, and the many distressed sufferers on their behalf, against the Duke of York and others, and of the probability and convenience of the pre sent opportunity,\" they did \" resolve and deter mine to try how far they could reasonably under take and pursue their clear duty in the matter.\" As \" the wicked designs against the true religion,\" and for establishing* \" tyrannical monarchy,\" were not confined to Scotland, they deemed it proper, both in point of justice and prudence, to solicit the concurrence of the cordial friends of the com mon cause in the three kingdoms; \" especially con sidering that by want thereof, those two worthy appearances of our countrymen, the honourable assertors of our religion and liberties, at Pentland hills and Bothwell bridge, were so soon deserted and frustrated.\" As the first step to the accomplishment of this object, they resolved to sound the duke of Mon mouth and the earl of Argyle, who were then in the Low Countries. The duke having come to"], [325, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 307 Rotterdam to consult with them, entered fully into their views. The earl not only approved of their design, but urged them to accompany him with- out delay in an expedition to Scotland which he had already planned. Before pledging themselves, they requested to be made acquainted with his preparations, plans, and grounds of hoping for co-operation at home. He told them that, by the liberality of certain individuals favourable to the cause, with whom he had become acquainted in England, * he had been enabled to lay out ten thousand pounds in the purchase of arms and am- munition, a ship and provisions ; that he had ex- tensive correspondence with Scotland, could raise five thousand men among his own vassals, and had assurances of support from other quarters of the kingdom ; and that, being intimately acquaint- ed with the different parts of the country, he knew where to land, march, and encamp to the best ad- vantage ; but that it behoved them to place confi- dence in him, as he could not impart particulars to them without breach of confidence, and hazard to the whole undertaking. The gentlemen were satisfied with the manner in which he had expend- ed the money intrusted to him, but thought they were entitled to more explicit information on the other points on which they had conversed. * See before p. 138, 147, and Wodrow, ii. 541."], [326, "308 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. Argyle having testified an aversion to co-oper ate with Monmouth, and some of their own num ber being jealous that the duke aimed at gratify ing his own personal ambition, the gentlemen procured another interview with his grace. On that occasion, Sir Patrick Hume (created earl of Marchmont at the Revolution) asked him, if he considered himself as the lawful son of the late king, and if he intended to lay claim to the crown. To the first question the duke replied in the affir mative ; and in answer to the last, he said that he had no intention of claiming the crown, \" unless it were advised to be done by those who should concern themselves and join for delivery of the na tions ;\" and that, if he should be advised to assume the title of king, he would, in the event of success, \" give it up in the hands of the people or their representatives, accept of what station in the com monwealth they should bestow on him, and think himself fully rewarded by being instrumental of so much good to the nations.\" Sir Patrick having told him, that they found many of their best friends in England \"jealous of his aspiring to the royal dignity, of which, by reason of the great abuses of it, and the miserable consequences so habitual as now become its second nature, they icere extreme ly disgusted; * and so somewhat averse from * Mr. Rose has made no remark on these words of the ancestor of his noble friend.

Greater difficulty was felt in coming to an ar rangement with Argyle. He thought himself en titled to manage every thing relating to the ex pedition as he judged best, because he had pro cured the funds necessary for fitting it out. The gentlemen pleaded, that these funds were put into his hands for advancing the common cause, and that, by taking part in this, they had a right to be consulted as to the disposal of them. In con versing on the expedition, he talked of himself as general. They had never thought of any other for that post, but considered that he should owe who planned this expedition were of republican principles ; but it is difficult to give such an interpretation of them as does not im ply, that they wished to avoid pledging themselves in support of monarchy, out of deference to such of their friends as had con ceived a disgust at it.

He was willing to consult a council of the officers as to military ope rations ; but they pleaded that, besides this, a su perior authority was required to manage corre spondence, to declare the war, to appoint officers, and generally to act as a council of state ; a pro position to which the earl testified great antipa thy. With the view of accommodating a material point of difference between them, it was agreed that Argyle should make those communications to one of the gentlemen, (\" his own great friend, long acquaintance, and confidant,\") which he thought it dangerous to make to the whole ; but when that individual gave in a favourable report to his brethren it was unsatisfactory to them, be cause it turned out that he did not himself intend to go along with the expedition,* and that he had formed his opinion, not on evidence laid before him, but on the general assurances which he received from the earl, that he had the strongest ground to expect support on his landing, and that his plans were the best calculated for insuring suc cess.

This did not promise well for mutual confidence and cordial co-operation in the undertaking, the failure of which may be ascribed in no small degree to the jealousies and dissensions which broke out in Hol land.

In the mean time the duke of Athol * had raised a con siderable body of men, who came and assaulted us, so that we were drawn away from the castle, and left only 150 men to defend the same, in case it should be attacked. By this time we had a considerable number of Highlanders and men from the Isle of Cantyre, so that we went in pursuit of Athol's men, who constantly fled from us. We were pursuing them several days, and were still looking for more supplies from the low country, but none came to us. In the mean time, when we were thus taken up, the man-of-war, beyond our expectation, came clown the river, which, whenever our men that we had left saw, they were necessitated to leave the castle and come a-shore in boats, and set a train to blow up the magazine, for they saw all was lost. But the train did misgive, so that the enemy got all. When we heard this, Argyle and all that were September 18, 1685, the council wrote to court, \" that by a mis take Allangreg had been recommended for a remission as to life and fortune, whereas they never recommended any for a remission but as to life.\" (Wodrow, ii. 556.)

His vassals had not flocked, as he expected, to his standard, and more desert ed than joined him at every station on his way to the low country. The number of Highlanders who remained did not exceed five hundred, and the whole army scarcely amounted to nine hun dred. But as these appeared to be hearty in the cause, his leading associates encouraged him to advance and quit the Highlands without farther delay. Accordingly, they \" crossed Loch Long troublesomely in boats, and lay on the rocky side of it all night.\" Thence they marched to Loch Gaire. At that place they received intelligence that Huntly was advancing with a considerable body of men to join Athole, and that Dumbarton, with the standing forces and militia, was in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.

This was opposed by Sir Patrick Hume, who urged that, having lost their arms and ammunition in the fort, by which their men were exceedingly dis couraged, they could not fight the royal forces in a body with any hopes of success. He proposed that the earl should march back with his High landers by the head of Loch Long to Argyleshire, where, having fortified the pass at the head of the Loch, he could easily maintain himself, and levy soldiers among his vassals ; and that the rest of the troops, consisting of the volunteers who had come from Holland, and the Lowlanders who had joined them since their arrival, should be di vided, that the one half should be sent down Loch Long, and the other half down Loch Gaire, to land at places where there were no forces at pre sent, and that they should then retire to strong grounds, in which they could maintain themselves until their friends in different parts of the country should join them. To this proposal the earl positively refused to accede. \" Any that would not go with him (he said) might do as they pleas ed ; his intention was not to fight the enemy if he could shift them, but to march straight to Glas gow, and there do the next best.\" Those who had the most slender hopes of success were still unwilling to leave the earl ; \" and I (says Sir *2"], [336, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 318 Patrick) again persuaded the most unwilling, that wee did not separate.\" On Tuesday, the 16th of June, they marched from Loch Gaire and crossed the water of Leven at night, three miles above Dumbarton, after they had spent five weeks in the Highlands. Next morning early they marched, \" weary and hungry enough.\" About seven o'clock they discovered a large party of horse, which they considered to be the advance of the army, but which turned out to be a company of militia sent to observe them. After the men had stood to their arms for about an hour, the earl ordered them to proceed on their march, not by the hill-way to Glasgow, but by the village of Kilmaronock, to which they were conducted by Sir John Cochrane,* with the view of procuring them refreshment.]!

All people being wonderfully discouraged, took the opportunity to leave us in the night; but those that came together on the morrow came to Kirkpatrick. For, indeed, we lost many brave men by reason of the darkness of the night, who would have been loath to have left us ; especially one Rumbold,* an Englishman, who came from Holland with us.

As there was ha zard of his dying of his wounds, his trial was hastened, and he was executed at Edinburgh on the afternoon of the day on which he was condemned, June 26, 1685. \" He was certainly a man of much natural courage,\" says Lord Fountainhall ; \" his rooted, ingrained opinion was for a republic against monarchy, to pull which down he thought a duty and no sin.

But the drums were then commanded to beat ; otherwise he carried discreetly enough, and heard the minis ters, but took none of them to the scaffold with him.\" (Decisions, i. 366.) That he died piously appears from Wodrow's ac count, which contains no avowal of republican principles.

And one of their horses being shot dead, and some wounded, the five men that lay at the side of the old boat, firing at us, made haste to get to their horses, and so the whole troop fled ; and we got ashore as fast as we could, and pursued them.

My lord, faire you well.\"] * * Sir Patrick Hume's Narrative, p. 64. Wodrow drew up his narrative of the expedition from statements made by Argyle him self, and from an account printed at the time, by one who vindi cates the earl's conduct, and ascribes his failure to his having been thwarted in all his measures by some of those who accompanied him, particularly by Sir John Cochrane and the \" famous orator,\" by whom he probably meant Sir Patrick Hume. Wodrow has been followed by Mr. Laing and Mr. Fox, neither of whom ever saw Sir Patrick's Narrative, which the public owes to the reflections on his conduct contained in Mr. Fox's History. Where dissensions have taken place, it is scarcely possible to form a perfectly correct opinion from the statements of only one of the parties. Mr. Fox had too much penetration not to perceive, and too much impartiality not to confess, the impetuosity and opinionativeness of Argyle, although he considered these faults as redeemed by gal lantry of spirit, candour of mind, and kindness of heart. On the other hand, he acquits Sir Patrick Hume and Sir John Cochrane of treachery, and allows that the one, as well as the other, show ed himself \" uniformly sincere and zealous in the cause of his country ;\" but then he has too hastily adopted the statement of Argyle, who (evidently referring to these two gentlemen) says, they were \" the greatest cause of our rout, and of my being taken ; though not designedly, I acknowledge, yet by ignorance, coward ice, and faction.\" (History, p. 197, 198, 213.) As applied to Sir John Cochrane, and even to Sir Patrick Hume, the charge of \" cowardice\" must certainly be abandoned ; nor do I think that those who impartially read the statements on both sides, will be prepared to subscribe to the charges of \"ignorance and faction.\" Sir Patrick Hume is described by one of his contemporaries as \" a gentleman of clever parts \u2014 a lover of set speeches, and can hardly give an advice to a private friend without them.\" (Carstairs's Let ters, p. 100.) It would seem that Argyle had conceived an early prejudice against him as pragmatical and irksome in his opposition, while Sir Patrick in his turn distrusted the earl as rash and head strong.

I tied up three loaves in my napkin, thinking to keep myself from such a strait for some time as I had been in before ; and I tied them to my belt, but, through sleepiness and weariness, I lost all. After this, we resolved to mount ourselves with horses, (being all well armed,) and to ride straight toward England, where we doubted not but Monmouth was prospering.

They coming within our view, we marched up to a stead * that stood upon the top of a brae, where there was a very pretty thorn hedge enclosing a garden, into which we entered, and resolved there to stand for our defence. When we had wait- ed a considerable time, and saw no appearance of their approach, Sir John says, \" These cowardly rogues dare not come and attack us in this strength. Come, let us go out and fight them in the open fields.\" So he divided his 150 men into three companies : himself to command one ; and Polwart, another ; and major Henderson, the third. So we marched directly towards them, who were drawn up in a plain, a little below the house ; who, at the very first appearance of us, fled and went quite out of our sight. So we saw no more of them till it was afternoon ; by which time they had got other two troops, the one com- manded by my lord Ross, the other by captain Cleland.

And after we had received their fire, we discharged upon them again very vigorously, and then betook us to our halberts, (for every man of us had a halbert, besides special firelocks) so that we made them retire. There was no harm done on either side at the first fire ; only Mr. Thomas Archer, a young gentleman on our side, received a dangerous wound in the back, by which he was disabled, and left lying on the ground.

In the mean time, we got into an old stone-fold, which was a little de- fence to us. Sir John took the whole command upon him, and so divided us, and set one half on his right hand, and the other on his left, and gave orders to all to \" charge and make ready,\" and ordered those on his right hand first to receive the enemy's fire, and after that not to fire till he gave them a sign by his napkin, and after the sign to fire briskly, and then to take their halberts in their hands, in case the enemy should attempt to come over the little stone-dyke, and to defend them selves bravely ; and ordered those on his left not to fire when those on his right fired, till once he gave them another sign, and then to fire close upon the enemy, and after fire to take their hal berts and defend themselves from being trodden down.

One of our lads stept over the dyke and pulled Cleland's scarlet coat off him, and put it upon the top of his halbert, and waved it forgainst the enemy. They staid a considerable time before they made another assault ; and we put ourselves in a posture of defence, and loaded our pieces, and made ourselves ready to receive them. We were ordered to behave ourselves as at the former onset. Sir John said, \" They have now lost some blood; therefore they will make a vigorous assault ; and, therefore, lads, take cou rage, and stand to it, for our cause is good.\" So at length they approached again, and we received them as formerly ; and beat them from the dyke with the loss of more of their men. And if my lord Ross had not had on harness, he would have gone the same way Cleland went ; for the ball broke upon his harness, and hurt him on the neck. They were so affrighted that they durst not give us the fourth onset. The dyke did us good service, and defended us much from their shot ; for we were below them. We had none killed in all this action, except one man, who was shot through the head, and two more wounded ; besides Mr. Archer, who was wounded at the first fire, before we came into the fold.

After they were weary with shooting they gave over.* Then Sir John said, \" It becomes us to bless God for our wonderful preservation.\" He desired we would be all in a watchful posture; and, in the mean time, to go about the worship of God. And so he took a book and sang the forty-sixth Psalm throughout, and after that prayed pertinently. By this time our enemies had guarded us round as a ring, but without reach of our shot. It was an exceeding cold day as ever I saw at that time of the year. I had thrown off my big coat when we first en gaged ; and being cold, I went to seek it, where I found Mr. Archer groaning in his wounds.

I told him I could do no more for him at present, and that we were all yet still in hazard of our lives ; for we were surrounded by the enemy. When I returned, I told Sir John that Mr. Archer was dying of his wounds, who ordered several to go alongst and carry him to a herd's house which was hard by, and give the people of the house money, desiring them to take care of him. They received him very kindly ; from which place he was carried afterwards by the enemy to Edinburgh, where he was executed in the Grassmarket; whose speech and testimony are in record amongst the rest of the worthies who suffered for owning the truth.* After this, when it began to grow dark, Sir John said, \"What think ye of these cowardly rogues !

So we began to consider what to do next. And because many had left us the day before, Sir John took an oath of us, that we should not part one from another, without leave asked and given ; and then asked, who amongst us knew the ground to be our guide. There were none amongst us that knew it except himself, it being his father's ground that we were then on ; so he took the guiding of us himself. And so we marched exceeding hard all that night, that so we might be a good way off from the enemy ; but when day began to appear, that * \" We had no men killed in the action but four : few more wounded; but it was carried with that readiness of courage, that were I to choose 75 men upon my life's hazard, I would not re ject one of that 75 (and no more ther was) that came off that night.\" (Sir Patrick Hume's Narrative, p. 67.)"], [350, "332 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. we saw about us, behold we had gone the round, and were come back within two miles of the place where we engaged the enemy ! Sir John said, \" Woe is me ! I have led you into a snare. I know not now what to do for it ; for if we keep the field the whole body of the forces will be upon us : so come of us what will, we must lodge in some house.\" There was a stead hard by, where two of his father's tenants lived. He caused us all sit down upon the ground, till he sent major Hen- derson to acquaint the people that Sir John was there, and a company of men with him, and desir- ed they might give us quarters ; and to tell them, that, if they were quarrelled for it, we were a stronger party than they, and would take it by force ; but they most willingly received us. And there was a wonderful providence in our being so near the place of engagement, for when they rang ed all the country about, they came never near that place.* The major had travelled all that night with a bullet shot in his left shoulder, and sticking like a plum within the skin, none knowing of it but himself, which was cut out when we came to the house.

We lay there all that day very safely, and saw regiments passing by within two miles, but none came near us. So at night we took our march again, having sent before to provide quarters for us. So we got a guide, who conducted us safe to the place where we tarried next day, and sent some ft ' .nds to inquire if they could get any ac count of the earl of Argyle, who would not come alongst with us over Clyde. In the evening they brought us word that he was taken prisoner.* Then Sir John f called us all together, and told * The skirmish at Muirdyke took place on the 18th, and Argyle was taken on the same day.

It is rather surprising that Mr. Fox, in his reasoning respecting the intentions of the government to put the earl to torture, should not have adverted to a clause of a letter of Barillon, inserted by himself, which hears testimony to these intentions, and assigns the reason why they were not carried into effect. \" Le Comte d'Argile a ete execute\" a Edinbourg, et a laisse une ample confession par ecrit, dans laquelle ille decouvre tous ceux qui Ton secouru d'ar gent, et qui ont aide ses desseins : cela lui a sauvt la question.\" (Fox's History, Append, p. cxiv.) t Sir John Cochrane was apprehended in the end of June, in the house of his uncle Gavin Cochrane, near Kilbarchan, being"], [353, "335 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. us, \" That my lord was taken, and that we were now free from our oath, and every one of us might shift for himself the best way we could.\" So we had a lamentable parting.

An account of his apprehension, somewhat different, and not very consistent with itself, is given in Fountainhall's Diary, lately pub lished. Having mentioned the ignominious manner in which he was brought into Edinburgh, it concludes, \" And yet Sir John came with a statelie unconcerned paw.\" (P. 57, 58.) He had been forfeited, on the 22d of May, 1685, for accession to the Rye house plot, (Act. Parl. Scot. viii.

So we resolved to travel all night, and to dern* all day ; and buy victuals as we went alongst, for as yet we wanted not money. So we went on, and marched through a weary long moor, and then came to the plain ground, and had travelled a good way in the plain before it came to be very light. This was on the sab bath morning. When we began to see about us, we could not perceive either wood or moss to shelter in all day. Then we wist not what to do, the whole country being full of the king's forces, so that we were afraid of being apprehend ed. We resolved to venture on some house.

But she let us see a house a little way off, who, she said, would shelter us, if we were such men as we gave ourselves out to be. So we came to that house, and sent one to call at the door, whereupon the goodman came out. Our case was made known to him. He said, \" Gentlemen, ye need not think to deceive me, for ye are not such men as ye say ye are.\"f I stept near and said, \" Friend, we truly came alongst with Argyle, and our lives are in hazard, and if ye refuse to shelter us, ye cannot be free of our blood, if we should fall into the enemy's hands.\" Whereupon the honest man condescends. So we went in, and though it was early in the morning, there was a brave fire burn ing on the hearth. We sat down and warmed ourselves.

Cornet Peter Inglis, with some soldiers, came to the house of Thomas Richards, a re spectable man, nearly eighty years old ; and pretending that they were part of the remains of Argyle's troops, the old man told them that he had lately entertained some of their friends, and was still ready to do it. Inglis carried him off to colonel Douglas, then at Cumnock, \" who, precisely upon this alleged confession, without jury or trial, next day executed him there.\" (Wodrow, ii. 509, 570.)

After we had break- fasted, he said, \" Now, gentlemen, what shall I do with you next, for your enemies will be abroad presently, and will range up our house for provi- sion ?\" He said, \" I have an old torn house, where our sheep lie, I think they will not go near it, being ruinous ; there are two steads lying on the balks of the house, I will cause my daughter carry up straw, and ye may He there till night.\" Which, accordingly, we did, and slept there as sound as ever we did upon a feather bed. And at night one of those men that were hiding in the widow's house, came to the honest man, and ask- ed, if there came four armed men there in the morning. He told him, there did. He asked, what men we were. He told him, we were very ho nest men. He desired to see us. He brought 1682, to discover his father's family when under concealment. \" The enemy swore that if we were out of hell they should have some of us, and for that end they disguised one of themselves, a fair well-favoured young man, in women's clothes, like a gentle- woman ; giving out that she was a cousin of our own, come from Ireland to invite us over there to our friends, because they had heard of our troubles in Scotland. This gained credit amongst our friends, who knew where we were.\" Having by this artifice got exact information of the hiding place, a party on horseback came ten miles to apprehend the family, but Mrs. Nisbet having discovered their approach, had sufficient time to remove herself and children into an inaccessible part of an adjacent morass, where her husband lay concealed.

He said it was impossible for us to win * there, without being apprehended ; for, he said, it was difficult for them to keep themselves out of the enemy's hands, though they knew the country better than we did. He advised us rather to stay with them, and assured us we should not want meat and drink, if we would take our hazard with them. And we complied with his advice. Now, there were very many of the west-country men upon their hiding, who had met together to have joined us if we had prospered-! So we took *get. t \" My brother, Daniel Ker, (says Ker of Kersland) after the death of my father at Utrecht, landing also in Scotland with the said Earl, repaired to the south-west, where the main body of die Cameronians were, and, at their request, taking the command up on him, he resolved to join Argyle as soon as possible; but some English men-of-war coming into our western seas cut off the communication, which obliged the Earl to march about by Glas gow, in order to join the Cameronians and his other friends in the west, who were all upon their march to meet him.\" (Kersland's Memoirs, p. 7.) The Cameronians generally were not dis posed to join the standard of Argyle. \"In April 1685, Mr. George Barclay and others came to the west of Scotland, in order to engage, preach up, and prepare a people to join Argyle, who came to Scotland about the middle of May thereafter with some men and many notable arms; which, when Mr. Renwick and the"], [358, "340 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. our leave of our landlord, and went alongst with him. He carried us away to a great moss, where we were to stay next day, for several of them had trysted to meet there. And as we were going to the place, he was to call at a house by the way who was to bring provisions to us, and desired us to stand at the end of the house till he spoke with the folk within. In the mean time, when we were standing, there came about twenty-four men, well armed, who were on their hiding also; and they came with the same resolution to desire these folk to bring provisions to them, in such a place as they were to lodge in the moss. Not knowing of us, they came close up to the place where we were standing. We hearing the noise of their feet a pretty while before they came up to us, one of our company said, \" We are all taken ! for there is a party of the enemy coming.\" So we had our arms ready to receive them, if they offered any violence. I looked betwixt me and the sky, and I perceived their arms, and saw that they had some sort of arms of their own making, which the forces used not. I said, \" They are surely friends.\" The other said, \" There could general correspondents of the united societies saw, his manifesto made them to demur and hesitate to concur in that expedition, upon these grounds and reasons,\" &c.

So we parted; for John Ferguson told them that he had bespoke the house to bring provisions to us and some others that were to meet with us in the moss. So they went to some other place for provisions. We lay in the moss all that night and all next day ; and then went, in the night time, to another place. We remained six weeks wandering up and down with them; whiles lying in the fields and sometimes in houses, and were hardly one night where we were the other. The country was exceeding kind to us, and would take nothing for our victuals. There was one night that there were about a dozen of us who were invited by some friends to come to Kilmarnock privately, in the night time, * John Ferguson, from Mains of Enterkin, in the parish of Tarbolton, appears in the Fugitive Roll.

Then we knew not what to do. We had travelled so far from the moors that we were afraid of being apprehend ed before we wan* there again, there being no friend's house near. Then they resolved to go to a man's house that was beinf enough, but no friend to them; only he had some honest servants, and they thought the man would not be ill-natured. There were several of the lads that were acquaint ed with him. So we sent one to call at the door, to see if they would harbour us, and were resolv ed to stay there by violence, if we could not pre vail with fairness. When the man came to the door, behold, it was not locked ; he came again and told us ; so we came in, and placed our arms beside us, and there was a fine gloss of fire on the hearth. We laid to some more peats, and kept very quiet. When the fire began to have some light, the good man's brother, lying in the hall, looked over the bed, and began to bless himself, saying, \" What's that there !\" One of them named him, and said, \" Be not afraid, it is kend folk.\" He asked, \" who *got. t wealthy."], [361, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 343 we were. They told him some of their names that he knew. He said, what the devil had brought us there ! We desired him to be quiet, for we should do them no wrong. He said, \" Devil a one of you stays here !\" Then he began to call aloud to his brother to rise and come to his assistance, for there were a great many of the mountain-men come there ; upon which his bro- ther rose in haste, and was as ill-natured as he. Then we four that were strangers took upon us to command. After no intreaties would prevail, we threatened to shoot the rascals dead, if we heard any more of their noise ; and forthwith we locked the goodman up in a close room, and made him prisoner, and set down his brother amongst us, and commanded him to silence, and threaten ed, if we had any more of his disturbance, we would immediately knock him down ; so after that we had great quietness. In the morning, very early, the servant men came in, being ordered by their master the night before to go to carry carriage-coals for their laird. The two servants were well inclined ; and after some time's converse with us they obtained leave to go. We made all the rest prisoners. In the morning, when the cattle and sheep were to go to their meat, the goodman and his brother began to desire liberty for the servants to take them out. We told them, we would be herds ourselves for that day. So two of our number took all"], [362, "344 MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. the cattle to their meat, and waited on them. Then the goodman and his brother began to use many intreaties to let them be set at liberty, and their life for it, they would do us no harm. At length we condescended, for that stead stood by itself a good way from any other, and we kept a watchful eye upon all that belonged to the house. The goodman, at length, began to be more friendly, telling us it was for fear of bringing hazard upon himself that made him so rude ; and desired that we might go down to his barn, where was a great deal of straw, and take us rest, and he and his brother would watch; which accordingly we did, but kept always three sentries to oversee them, that none went to give warning to the enemy. At length our landlord caused make breakfast ready for us of very good victuals, and caused set them down in our sight that we might take them, that, if he were chal lenged, he could say, he gave us neither meat nor drink. We continued safe till night, and so parted. When we had staid very long we began to think the country somewhat more quiet. We thought of venturing home to see our friends, whom we had not seen for two years and a half. Two of us went away first, and after that the other two ventured. My comrade and I kept our arms all alongst till we came to Calder Moor, and there left them with a friend that we were"], [363, "MEMOIRS OF GEORGE BRYSSON. 345 recommended to ; and so we came home; but were in as bad circumstances as we were in when we went off the country. For half-a-year we durst never travel safely but in the night; we thought we would be but a burden to our friends ; we re solved to go for England again, where we were not so well known. So my friend, who had been with me in the most part of all my travels, who is living at the writing hereof, (and was the per son I spoke of formerly, who was carried off the field into the house sleeping,) went away be fore me to Northumberland, and promised to write me if he got any settlement, which he did, accordingly, within a short time ; he being set tled in an honest family. He desired me to take my venture, for I knew not what providence might carve out for me. So I went directly to him, and staid with him eight or ten days, till Mr. James Welch,* a min ister of the gospel, my intimate friend, came there, who much bemoaned my wandering condi tion. He desired me to go alongst with him, for he was going the length of Alnwick, and was to stay some time up and down that country ; for he was, as all our faithful ministers were, wander ing up and down, preaching the gospel on peril of their lives. I went alongst with him, and he * Mr. James Welsh, preacher in Kirkcudbrightshire, is in the Fugitive Roll of 1684. (Wodrow, ii.

Upon a time he went to Berwick, and left me behind him till he returned ; and being in company with justice Grieve's wife, she asked him, if he could wish her husband to an honest man to oversee his af fairs, that he could put trust into. He said, \" Madam, I am glad ye have made the proposal, for I know of a very trusty friend whom I can confidently recommend to you.\" So he sent for me to meet him at Tweedmouth, which I did. The justice and I agreed immediately, and I promised to enter home against Martinmas. I went to Edinburgh, and staid a little with my friends, and then entered home at the time ap pointed. I think that the Lord had wonderfully carved out that service for me, for I pleased my master very well, and he pleased me. My wages were not great, but only five pounds per year and my diet ; but, indeed, I thought it a great matter at such a time. I staid with him very comfortably for the space of five years ; and then came on the happy Revolution, so that such as were in my circumstances were at more liberty than formerly.

And as the Lord was pleased to guide me in every step of my life, so he was won- derfully kind to me in my marriage ; for he trysted me with a godly wife, who was a true yoke-fellow indeed; and the most part of the time we lived together she made it her work to be making sure \" the one thing needful.\" When we had lived one-and- twenty years comfortably together, her Master was pleased to call her home to himself ; where, I hope, she is enjoying that which she much longed for.

By fighting at the time he did, instead of delaying, as he knew he could easily do, he provided for the better escape of his men, in the event of their being worsted ; and, indeed, the loss actually sustained was less than it would in all probability have been, if, without engaging, he had disbanded his army during the night.

Bishop Burnet represents \" some fiery ministers,\" whom he names as the \" chief incendiaries.\"* The following statement by one of those whom he accuses, which bears internal marks of candour, goes to show that the mi nisters, instead of inflaming, endeavoured to re strain the spirit of the people. It will serve also as a proper introduction to the subsequent Narrative, by supplying a new and summary ac count of what took place in Galloway and at Dumfries, before colonel Wallace joined the party. \" The soldiers drove the ministers out of Gal loway and Niddisdale, where the meetings were most frequent. So, many of them came privately to Edinburgh and lurked there, and preached more privately. At which time soldiers did sad ly distress the country, -where the meetings had been, and those that went not to church, by fin ing, imprisoning, driving of their cattle, which did much exasperate the people ; so that some of them were busy to traffic through their own * History of his Own Times, i. 341."], [399, "NOTICES OF COLONEL WALLACE. 381 country, and the west, and other places, for some appearance for their own relief and deliverance from the persecution. Several, both gentlemen and others, did regret the same ; and after going to and from for advice and assistance, and con sulting about the same, and seeking the Lord therein, some were for appearing in an hostile way, and some not ; and so it was put off from one time to another. At last I was advised by some friends to go privately into Galloway or the borders of it, to be informed of their case and what they designed to do, and to report at Edinburgh. I went accordingly, and met with several of their leading men, who were longing for an opportunity of appearing together for their defence. I told them, it was not rashly to be done, but well advised with others in other places. So we sent to the west and elsewhere for counsel in the matter, and to come back with in ten days. In the mean time excellent Mon rieff, a laird in Galloway, the greatest Chris tian that I knew in his station, going to Edin burgh, came to me where I was privately. I desired him to tarry for the next meeting, and told him when and where it was, which he did. So we, going to the place of meeting at the time appointed, and being met together, they told us, that Barscobe and some others of the people were fallen foul with some of the soldiers quartered in the country, and had hurt some and secured se- 2"], [400, "382 NOTICES OF COLONEL WALLACE. veral of them ; the report of which going to other places of the country, the people did the like with their soldiers. The first occasion of this outfall as I learned was, that they were offer ing to torture at the fire some honest men that did not comply with them ; and Barscobe said soberly to them, ' Why do you use the honest m an so ?' and looked about a little. Whereupon some of the soldiers offered to them violence. Upon which a woman cried to Barscobe, ' Turn, what are you doing ?' And when he looked and saw what they were doing against them, he drew a pistol, wherein there was only tobacco-stapples, and shot at one of them ; at which the soldier fell, but I do not remember that he was killed. So it began, and they secured the rest there and elsewhere. Monrieff and I were grieved with this accident, and knew not what advice to give them in the case. Some knew not what to say, but the most forward said, there had been talk ing enough upon that affair, that it was fit to take that opportunity to appear, which if they did not, Sir James Turner, that was at Dumfries, would come with all his men and destroy the country ; and that it was best to prevent that by marching to Dumfries and securing of him. I was truly Laban in the case ; but I told, if they were so resolved, I should go straight to the west to acquaint friends there; which I did, riding all night to get soon there. So they went for Dum-"], [401, "NOTICES OF COLONEL WALLACE. 383 fries, and chused one Mr. Gray for their head, and they came and took Sir James Turner pri soner, and set him on a low beast, without his best raiment, and carried him through the town in a despicable manner, where the providence of God was to be seen of that sudden change. There he had been reigning like a king, and lift ed up in pride, with insolency and cruelty over the poor people, and so they carried him alongst with them to the west. He told them, if that rising was general they would carry it ; if it were but in that corner, they could not do it. The old Register, Primrose, (I heard,) said, that the party that had been so favourable to spare Sir James Turner, would not do the business : they had not a spirit. And a worthy knowing minister spoke to the same purpose to me after the defeat. I replied to him, they had a spirit for that for which they were raised up, to give an innocent testimony for the Lord and his op pressed work and people, which had not been given before ; neither did the king and the court know the case of the country, and the temper of the people. For they were made to believe, that if a few gentlemen were kept in security, and a few ministers, he would have perfect peace. So that appearance, with the meetings that followed, occasioned the relaxation and liberty which was given by the Indulgence. This was observable of that rising, that several of those who did en-"], [402, "384 NOTICES OF COLONEL WALLACE. courage it in discoursing, and seemed to be frank for it, yet drew back when it came to be made effectual. And if those gentlemen and ministers in the west had risen, when they were there that came from Galloway, it might have done the business ; for to speak humanitus, after the man ner of men, five hundred more men might have obtained a victory ; there was such a general dissatisfaction with the alteration of the church government, and the persecution it occasioned. They had many thousand well-wishers at Pent land, that, if they had thought they could have carried with their assistance, would have been there ; and so the Commissioner then observed, that, if they had prevailed but a little, they would have got many thousands to join with them.

After this we go straight to the par- ty, and after saluting them, the party marched off towards Ochiltree ; but because it was far in the day, we were necessitated to quarter between Gad- girth and Ochiltree. By this time we got sure intelligence that the General's forces were come to Glasgow, and so found ourselves concerned to look to our guards. To-morrow morning, being Thursday, we marched away to the rendez- vous place, on the road to Ochiltree, where Mr. Sempel preached while the party convened. After that we marched in towards Ochiltree, having left the great part of the horse in the country to the west hand of Ochiltree, and nearest the bridge of Barskimen, the only passage of the water at the time : the rest of the horse we sent to the east of Ochiltree, to guard on that hand: the foot we kept in the town.

At Dublin Monreith contracted a tympany, of which he died at Benbarb or Armagh. (Sempil's Life, MS. p. 49.)

He had no written commission from any : what he spoke to this purpose he spoke it not only as sent from the duke, but it was his own judgment we should accept of the offer, and that it would be our best ; for, in all probability we would not be able to stand before them, both in respect of the number of their men, and of their appointment every way.

Now, because of the condition we were in, being not above 800 or 900 men, and these most part without arms, and now being out of expectation of any supplies, except what little help Major Gilgour had told us of, we might expect from Tiviotdale, which was both very uncertain and inconsiderable ; and considering the miserable condition of the weather we had gotten all that eight days before, and the sore marches night and day in our seeking to call out and gather together our friends ; and what influence these things had upon our spirits to discourage and break us, besides the influence they had on our bodies \u2014 for these reasons we were to have sent one of our number with Blackwood to the general Dalyell, by whom we might represent our griev ances and the grounds of our thus appearing in arms ; but because we had none, whom we might spare, fit for the employment, but one, whom Blackwood told us, not being a law-biding man, would not be acceptable, for this cause we for bare, and resolved (Blackwood being come to us"], [432, "414 WALLACE'S NARRATIVE OF without any formal commission, only pretending he was sent to us to speak what I told you be fore) to write back to Dalyell with him, though he had not written at all to us.

In the close there was mention of one of our soldiers killed in our quarters, not withstanding the parole mentioned by Blackwood. The letter was subscribed by Wallace, and sent away by Blackwood, who promised with all speed to have the return at us very soon ; and because he was uncertain where he might find us, we bade him hasten back to his own house, and he"], [433, "THE RISING AT PENTLAND. 415 should know there where to find us.

Both parties marches thus along the side of their own hill, towards an even place of ground, to which both of them came. They were not long asunder, when once they were there.

Upon the foot's approach they were forced to quit that side of the glen that lay on the west hand, and to go over to the east side of the glen, where they stayed till their foot came up. In this con- dition we stood foreagainst other : neither of us could well come at other where we stood. When their foot came up, their whole horse and foot came down off the hill towards a moor beneath us on our right hand ; and there they drew up in battle array, thinking to provoke us to quit our ground, and to fight them on even ground. We perceiving how numerous they were, being at least (whatever they were more) in all three times our number, resolved we would not quit our ground. There we stood only fronting other.

Now we had no more but a matter of fourscore horse to meet with their whole left hand. Always, all marches up towards other, but being oppressed with multi- tude we were beaten back ; and the enemy coming- in so full a body, and so fresh a charge, that having us once running, they carried it so strong- ly home, that they put us in such confusion that there was no rallying, but every man runs for his own safety.

Being forfeited for accession to the rebellion in 1666, he was transferred from one prison to another during many years, and after different petitions was at last liberated on a declaration, that he had \" resolved, by his future deportment and behaviour, to witness the deep sense he hath of his gracious Majesty's great clemency ;\" he having found caution under 5000 merks to re-enter into prison when required.

He is said to have died at sea on his way to Carolina.

Hugh was alive in 1644, (Act. Parl. Scot. vi. 133,) and was either the father, or (which is more probable) the grandfather of \"Robert Ker of Kersland, younger,\" who was at the battle of Pentland. In a list of the rents of certain forfeited estates made in 1669, Kersland is valued \u2014 \"Victual 119 bolls, deducing to Old Kersland 60 bolls.\" (MSS. in Adv. Lib. folio, No. xxxii.

The name of the petitioner has been carefully deleted, but on a narrow inspection appears to be \" Robert Ker of Kersland,\" prisoner in the \" castle of Stirling.\" The date, which has been altered, was originally 1675. In a note on the back of the petition, in a different hand- writing, and apparently Kerslaud's, the petitioner signifies that, after the draught was made, he hesitated as to its being his duty to present it, \" being diffident of treating or tampering with these so dreadfully-given-up men.\" (MSS. in Adv. Lib. Jac. V. 2, 26, art. 30.) A letter, which appears to be written by the same per- son to Macward, is dated, \" From my closs prison at Stirling castle, the 31st Dec. 1673.\" The writer says, \" though I know not if Forbes (Colonel Wallace) be there, yet about a week ago I wrote to him, which was my second.

But he did not escape the severities of that time, being fined for negligence in suppressing conventicles in 1676, obliged to withdraw for refusing to take the bond in 1678, and imprisoned for reset in 1683. (Wodrow, i. 427, 486; ii. 306.) What is stated in the text respecting the forfeited estates committed to his management is only correct in part. His commission to that purpose, dated Oct. 12, 1 667, is inserted in Wodrow, i. app. No. xvii. It is probable that the rents of these estates had been illegally lifted by the agents of General Dalziel, etc. and that the lords of the treasury obliged them to account for their intromis sions to the laird of Househill; but these estates were, in the year 1670, gifted by the crown to Dalziel, Drummond and others. (Samson's Riddle. Wodrow, i. app. No. xviii. Crawfurd's Renfrew, 301, 302.)

Only the three Lothians were very active in and about the time of the skirmish, and after, in the flight, took many more than Dalzell's men did, and killed severals also in their escaping ; for which they may look for a scourge in due time for their savage cruelty, from him in whose sight the blood of the saints is precious. * Baidland, and of Alexander Porterfield, Quarellton's brother, for which Sir George promises to be cautioner for a limited time.

In November preceding, the privy council grant ed warrant to Sir George Mackenzie, his Majes ty's advocate, to proceed judicially against forty six persons in the shires of Linlithgow, Stirling, and Ayr, for being in the rebellion at Bothwell. The trial took place on the 9th of January, when the advocate insisted only against twenty-two, of whom Ure was the first-named. The tenor of the indictment (which has not been published) deserves notice, as a specimen of that odious sys tem of exaggeration and aggravation, which Sir George Mackenzie introduced into criminal pro ceedings. The pannels are charged with the murder of two soldiers, although none of them was ever suspected of that crime ; and no attempt was made to bring forward evidence on that head ; nor are the names of the soldiers, or of the com panies to which they belonged, given.

Mr. Robert Hamilton was a gentleman of good family, being brother to Sir William Hamilton of Preston, to whose title and estates he would have succeeded, on his death, at the Revolution, if he had not refused to own, or rather had not open ly disowned, the authority of William and Mary. He appears to have been a pious man and of good intentions, but of narrow views, severe in his temper, and altogether unqualified, by want of military talents and experience, for the command which he assumed, or which was conferred on him by the small body which proved successful in the skirmish at Drumclog. He is charged, and apparently not without reason, with having been active in pushing Cargill, Cameron, and some other ministers, to those extremes which produc ed a breach between them and their brethren, with whom they had until of late acted in con cert. This dissension was a main cause of the failure of the present attempt to redress national grievances. Hamilton and his party acted on the principle, that it was unlawful to associate, for vindicating their civil and religious rights, with any but those with whom they could join in church-communion; or, which amounts to the same thing, that it behoved them to introduce in to the state of their quarrel, as appearing in arms,"], [471, "NOTICES OF JAMES URE. 453 a condemnation of every thing in relation to the public interests of religion which was sinful or unscriptural ; a principle which, while it involved them in that very confounding of civil and eccle siastical matters against which they inveighed so loudly under the name of Erastianism, tended to rivet the chains of servitude on themselves and the nation. Into this error they appear to have been betrayed partly by mistaken notions of the controversy which had formerly arisen respecting the Public Resolutions. What the more honest party at that period opposed was, the admitting to places of power and trust of such as had shown by their previous conduct that they were enemies to the reformation introduced into church and state, and would use the power intrusted to them to overturn it. This could not be said of those who had accepted of or acquiesced in the Indul gence, and still less of those whom Hamilton's friends wrangled with so fiercely, who protested solemnly that they disapproved of the Indulgence, and whose former conduct vouched for the since rity of their protestations. Another remark is sug gested by the facts here referred to. If ministers of the gospel would preserve their usefulness and respectability, they must guard their independence on the side of the people as well as of civil rulers. Provided they become \" the servants of men,\" it matters not much whether their masters wear a crown or a bonnet ; and if, instead of going before"], [472, "454 NOTICES OF JAMES URE. the people to point out to them the path of duty, and checking them when they are ready to run into extremes, they wait to receive directions from them, and suffer themselves to be borne along by the popular stream, the consequences cannot fail to be fatal to both. Firm and tenacious of his purpose, the servant of the Lord, while gentle to all, ought to hold on the even tenor of his way, unmoved equally by the frown of the tyrant, the cry of the multitude, and the dictates of for ward individuals, good and well-meaning men it may be, but who \" cannot see afar off,\" and just need the more to be led that they think themselves capable of being leaders. An opposite conduct on the part of two or three ministers tended to foster those extravagant opinions and practices adopt ed by some presbyterians at this period, which discredited the cause for which they appeared, and which their best friends, though they may ex cuse, will not be able to defend, and should not seek to vindicate.

I told them, that we heard that Cameron was here, and that was the stay ; and if he had been, I would have presently returned ; but if we had known that Mr. Welsh and Mr. Barclay* had been here, we would have been upward of two hundred men.

Upon the morrow, [Monday, the 9th,] they came all into the town, and so we stayed till the day at night. They marched two miles to a park towards Hamilton, where we abode. I abode that night in the town myself ; for that day that they marched, there came to me from our country upwards of seven score, for the most part well armed : these that wanted I got them pikes, so that our company was upward of two hundred well appointed, two parts with guns, and the third part with pikes. There was at first several that wanted arms, (near to thirty,) but they were still slipping away home, so as we had arms enough ere all was done. They kept a very strict guard that night in the town; and there was a knave in the town, a finer of wool, who came to the captain of the guard, and told him, he knew of one who had several arms hid in his house. He gave him four persons to go with him and see. When they came, he caused them stand at the door. He went into one Walkingshaw's house, and drew his sword and threatened to kill him, if he would not give him two dollars, the which he gave him; and when he returned, he said, he [Walkingshaw] had put them away. Upon the morrow, he knowing whose men they were, came to me and told me all, and if he had sought 100 dollars he behoved to have given them .

I intreated him to find him out, the which he did ; and when I got him, I got but one dollar with him, for he had drunk the other. I delivered it back and carried him bound with me to Hamilton. The day that the butcher was shot, his lugg was nailed to the gallows* We went all to Hamilton, and * Speaking of this gallows, Swift, in his Memoirs of Captain Creighton, says, \" The rebels had set it up in the middle of their camp, \u2014 in order to hang up the king's soldiers.\" This gratuitous and improbable supposition has been since repeatedly brought for ward by writers of a certain description, as if it were founded on undoubted evidence. All the contemporary writers who mention the gallows speak of it as a matter of course, in the same way as they would do of any other post or monument which marked a particular spot. Blackader says the prisoners, after the battle, \" were all gathered together about a gallows that stood there.\" (Memoirs, p. 249.) Another account says, \" Amongst the rest of the prisoners at the foot of the gallows, where we were gathered together in Hamiltone moore, after quarter was given, one man rising up in great extremitie, calling for a drink of water, was immediately shot dead by one of the soldiers.\" (MSS. in Adv. Lib. No. lx. Jac. V. 1, 10, art. 107.) The covenanters did not even make use of it as an instrument of death ; for the butcher was not hung, but shot, for the murder of one of their men. There is no reason to doubt, that this was the ordinary place where criminals were executed by order of the Sheriff-court of the Lower Ward of Lanark. William Hamilton of Wishaw, having stated that the shire of Lanark anciently comprehended the whole sheriff dom of Renfrew, adds: \"Because of the largeness of its extent, it was divided into two wairds, called the upper and the nether waird; and the burgh of Lanerk declared to be the head burgh of the upper waird, and Rutherglen of the nether waird.

When his sentence was read to him, he called for a minister, to whom he confessed bestiality several times, but nothing as to the killing of the man, which we can all declare. Mr. Welsh, and all the ministers, and many more of us, would have had witnesses brought and his confession subscribed by him, the burgh of Lanerk is the head burgh of the sheriffdome of Lanerk, and Rutherglen the head burgh of the nether waird thereof.

As for Mr. King, he was still for peace making, and was not so bent for us as he should, which I told him several times ; but he still kept company with us. The morrow we met again in the moor, about putting out a declaration. We divided about it, for they would have had the steps of de fection of the church in it, expressly the Indul gence and sins of the land, king, and others.

I gave him no answer at all, but heard all, and afterward returned to my men, who were lying in the close, where were Mr. Welsh and the rest of the brethren for penning of the decla ration. I went to him and told him all that had past, and I desired him to put forth a declara tion that would give satisfaction to the multitude ; for if we meddled with the king or with the indul gence, it would hinder many to come who would be as willing as we and were waiting till they saw it, and would make friends to become ene mies ; and no fear what Robert Hamilton and his party could do : that if he was clear therein as in the sight of God, I should stand by him as long * George Hume of Greddin is in the proclamation against re bels.

There were two companies at the bridge, and they came and desired me to go down and assist them ; so I went, and the other company of Stirlingshire men and Glasgow company. I drew up hard upon the water-side against the west end of the rebels, Robert Fleming of Auchinfine, who commanded them, sent John Lockhart of Bar, and Alexander Lockart, along with him to Hamilton, where he met with Mr. John King, who conveyed him to Welsh and Hume, by whom he was conducted to a meeting of officers in the moor. Lockhart of Mar deponed, that \" had it not been for the intelligence brought by the said Miller, the king's army had surprized the rebels, and got all of them as it were in a hose net.\" Lord Melville told the messenger, that \" if he were at Mr. John Welsh, he would sit down on his knees and beg them to lay down their arms ;\" for, \" if they will not follow advice, and these people be broken, it will ruin the presbyterian inte rest.\" (Act.

Glasgow, when they came down, drew up on my right hand, and Lennox on my left ; there came also down about 200 Galloway foot: they had no other arms but pikes and halberts, with four pair of colours, and took ground on our right hand farthest from our enemy. There came one troop of their horse and drew up behind us, and then our cannon was drawn down, being a field piece and two muskets of found unmount ed :* so these were not made use of. About three hours in the morning [Sabbath, June 22d,] there advanced from the west side of Bothwel kirk four companies of dragoons, and the king's troop of the guard, and the duke William's troop; and so they advanced close to the bridge. The rest of their army was near a mile off, but marching north-west, for they came about because of their cannon which was with them. They sent down near to the bridge six men, who fired upon our men at the bridge, and we gave them a return. We received no hurt but one man wounded on the foot ; and I believe some of them were wounded, if not killed ; for they lay down where they fired, but I never saw them rise again. Robert Hamilton and Mr. Hume came to us, and several others.

They desired us to come over and they would not harm us, and called for Mr. Hamilton to speak with him ; so Mr. David Hume * went over, and another gentle man with him, and spoke with the duke, and de sired his Grace if he would prevent the effusion of blood. He told them, their petition should have been more humbly worded, and said, lay down our arms and come in his mercy, and we should be favourably dealt with : so he returned and told us. When Robert Hamilton heard it, he laughed at it, and said, \"and hang next.\" So we sent over word, we would not lay down our arms. He bade us likewise advise us, but would not grant a ces sation ; so they fired over a cannon amongst our men, and killed two horses but no men. We fir ed our cannon, and muskets played on both sides. When our cannon shot they left their cannon, fled both horse and foot, near five pair of butts. If we had had any person to have commanded us, we might have gained their cannon ; but if I should have gone without command, if they should have turned on me, there would none have relieved me. * Mr. David Hume, minister at Coldingham, was intercora muned, in 1676, for preaching in the fields.

The two companies that was out (not) of Glasgow they left us ; also Glas gow company followed them, and one of our com panies from my left hand also.

I was necessitated to retire ; so I returned back over the bell of the breaf about four pair of butts, and halted and charged again. Lithgow's son was the first that came over the bridge, with 300 foot and a troop of horse upon his rear. So they advanced towards us, upon which I desired our men to face about and let them see that we were not flying ; and so I went back, and there followed me at first but about thirty-four of my men, and the rest ad vanced after them.

With the first shot they kill ed two men to me, and there was another killed with a musket; and I saw none coming to assist. I was forced to retire to the moor to the rest. On my retiring there was some of theirs pursued, and killed a man that had been wounded on the bridge. I caused my party face about, and chased them back ; but they outran us to their party. When we came from the bridge, for ought that I know or can hear, there was none of my men killed but one man, andmy three, and the man that was wounded.

I got my horse a little before this. When I placed my men I leaped on my horse to see the enemy's order of battle. What number they were I know not, but I am sure they were three times our num ber ; so I rode alongst their battle within shot of them a great way, and came back alongst to our men again ; and so I came encouraging them what I could, for I saw none to do it.

To the trueth of which deed, as done by him, I did, with some others, suscrib as witness, which being present in the time, I could nather in conscience nor ingenuitie refuse, especiallie sith it was so well knowen to all the world that knew him, that that was his fixed judgment, and that when a-dieing, it did so much afflict him, that any report to the contrare should have gone of him ; and whereas it is like it will be said by some that it is for gery, and not his own deed, or at best extorted from him when he knew not what he did or said, I shall, for myne owne, but more for the worthy dead man's just vindication, beg leave to say a few things.

He did, on Wednesday morne ing, the day of his dictating that testimony, to another person worthy to be trusted, say, after prayer, no occasion at all being given be that person, I take you witnes, before the Lord, that I did not directly, nor indirectly, speak any thing to the prejudice of Presbyterian government, but to the contrare, I judge it to be a trueth of God, for which a Christian, as he is called to it, should suffer. 5.

There cometh along in this vessell, directed to Mr Russell, some papers sent from John Cairnes : they are a rare and rich jewel, especially for the poor Church of Scotland, both shaming and allarming us, \u2014 Mr Calderwood's History, which with some difficulty and importunity two-three of us have at last obtained. The copy is taken from his own ma nuscript*, being the third and last cura, and faithfully colla tioned with it : it is very fairly wreaten, which 4 of us have payed for. You will, I am sure, read it with much both satisfaction and sorrow, and it will be acceptable beyond much gold. Mr Weily had dealt earnestly for it with the person in whose custody it was ; and I did put Mr Wyly to ride again to him, with my assurance that it should be both secretly aud faithfully disposed of; and wrote after, but then obtained nothinge ; but have since, in good * This MS., containing corrections on the margin in Mr Calderwood's hand-writing, is still preserved, and is in the possession of James Douglas, Esq. of Cavers. From that family, distinguished by its adherence to Pres bytery, Mr Carstairs most probably obtained the use of it at that time. Mr Thomas Wyllie, (the person referred to in this letter,) was minister first at Borg, and afterwards at Mauchlin, from which he was removed to Kirkcud bright, some time before the Restoration. On the 29th of October, 1667, he was permitted to return, from his confinement, to the south of the Forth, Edinburgh excepted. (Wodrow, i. passim.) He afterwards accepted of an indulgence to the parish of Fenwick, on a call from the people, and died the \" twentie day of July, 1676.\" (Decr. Sec. Concil. 16 Jan. 1677.)

I know its much longed for in both kingdoms, and probably will sell well if not feared. It makes a sad discovery of the dreadful opposition of our Qroyarj house, especially to the kingdom of Christ, which will bring it belike as a martyr to the fire. On many accounts it wold be keeped severely closse and secret : the danger of discovery wold be great to many, which will be obvious to yourself. I have given the copy to John Carnes, to make of it what he can ; and if it come through, it may, throughe God's blessing, make him somewhat up. Let it even be hastened with all convenient diligence, for this is the very seasoun for such a books coming out. Respect to the author, who speaks most savourily all alonge of our honest and faithfull great men, to the golden work, and to the Church of Scotland, will, I hope, persuade yourselfe and Mr Brown to correct the proof sheets, and I think worthy Wallace may herein be helpfull ; for it is of no particular man's concern, but a treasure of the church. Title and preface may be thought of time eneugh ; and its a good providence, I just now think, that it hath no title, since none of the printers will ever hear of the author's name till it be finished. It wold be done in such a letter as may sute the work, and yet not overcharge poor John with vast expence. I have no new thing to acquaint you with. You have heard, its like, of Mrs Dunlop's and young Mrs Guthrie's banishment from Edinburgh, for hearing preaching and prayer against the law. There is no abatement of our severity. Its like, this day there will be a great clamour in the councell, on occasion of a south country conventikle this last Sab bath, or Sabbath was eight dayes, by which a party of horse, sent to dissolve them, was darred and menassed away, being surrounded, and assured, if they offered violence to any there, none of them should goe off the place ; and so they left them.

Wallace, sweet Mrs Hoshepied, of whose recovery I longe to hear, Mr Hogge, and great Mr Broun ; thank him kindly, in my name, for his book. John Carnes waits, and I must stop here.

My dearest Brother, My goutish distemper still somewhat continouing, I can only kindly salute you, and tell you, that I have, since my last to you, (which, I hear, is by the east winde driven, in providence, hither again,) received Mr Wallace his return to yours and mine, both which I herewith transmitt to you.

I thought it not fit, on the account you gave me of the establishing that salary for a suc- cessor, to wreat to him again, judging the motive somewhat mer- cenary, as it's like he wold; but I judge that condescension a very signall signification of respect to you, and the procurement of it worthy a man's life : The fruit, the fruit of it may speak and blesse the Lord on your behalfe when you are dead.

My dearest, and of all men, most oblidging Friend and Brother, I take this occasion to salute you much in the Lord, to whom you are dear, and in whose heart you have much roum, and to tell you, that remembring your premptory assertion, that you wold doe no thinge that way, poor insignificant and very ignorant I the un fittest, you know of many, have constrained my seise to scrible an the General Assembly from the Reformation down, at least, to the year 1590 ; and what is here stated may serve to correct the account of their eeizure given by Bishop Keith.

They were seized in consequence of information, and not by accident ; and Bishop Paterson was not admitted a member of the Piivy Council until September 27, 1678, nor translated to the See of Edinburgh until March 29, 1679. (Fount. Dec. i. 17. Keith's Cat. 168.) The Registers were carried off after the Revolution, by Dr Archibald Campbell, a cadet of the family of Argyle, and non-jurant bishop, who gave them to the clergy of the province of London, with whom, it is understood, they stiU remain.

Wse your freedome with it, for the work and cause sake. I dare not trouble you with any account of our matters ; but great and growing are our confusions, distempers, and distractions. We are made by them exceedingly contemptible, and for any thinge I know, presbyterian government goto never such a blow in Brittain as it is like to receave by them ; and it's more than probable, that severall that ar weary of prelacy, and might incline to favour our persons, ar frighted and scarred from us because of our dividing and contentious practises, as if the very principles of our govern ment and party had a genuin and native tendency to them, since we thus so readily fall by the ears on every occasion. Ah ! He, the jeal ous and much provoked God, heth divyded us in his anger, and there is litle hope of healing ! My dearest, and even as wombe-born brother, suffer me to tell you, that it is wondred at by many, and even by some that ar your reall friends and myn, and I confesse I somewhat wonder at it my seise, that whatever is or may be your just dissatisfaction with the indulgence, that you should not only run this great and unexpected leinth in incouraging and persuading to withdraw and separat, and to allow and patronize these poor pe tulant young men, who, thoughe no plene ambassadours of Jesus Christ, roam up and down the country, and in places where they have"], [518, "500 APPENDIX, no calling, and very magisterially charge under highest pains, towith- drawfrom the indulged brethrens ministry, and load all with the im- putations of fainting and unfaithfulness who run not at that same rate, but also state your selves, being knowing and godly, eminently godly men, in an open and to the world declared opposition to all (a very few, if any, excepted) the honest suffering ministers of the Church of Scotland, so as to write against opinions, practises, pro- ceedings, forbearings, and all thinges abut these differences here in men, many of whom you knou, and so much in favours and com- mendation of some novices whom you knou not, some of whose in- solent extravagancies, I persuade my seise, the sober and humble soul of the tender, godly, knowing, and judicious Mr Mackquard wolde as much abhore, if knowen to him, as they ar incapable of a just apology. Is there no forbearance in these thinges to be expect- ed which we justly dissallow ? and shall our differences he screwed to such a hight, and so keenly and eagerly pursued, so as all fears of Popery and a forraigne sword (which ar like only to putt a pe- riod to them) ar swallowed up and forgotten ? Is there, my dearly beloved brother, and man greatly beloved, no place for intreaties and beseechings, to consider and endevour to prevent, before thinges be quite past remedy, (for I will dispute none,) is there, I say, no place to consider whither it wer better to supercede our contendings then to have our Church ruined ? I scarcely see a midle way for any thinge. I hear the sober and judicious godly in Scotland will not holde up with these late methods, and indirect wayes ar taken to blast evry mans repute that finds not in his heart to goe all the l.inth that some goe ; but its a small thinge to be judged of men. As for poor me, O, if I knou of a cottage in the wildernesse while I live, and were sure thence to goe to the kingdome !

I hear also, there is an answer to his 24 ar guments against hearing, which I find even sober persons not lay much weight upon ; but I have seen none of them, nor have I great pleasure to be entangled in that, alace ! not so greatly edifieing and much stumbling contraversy.

The Lord Archbishop and brethren of the Privy Conference, considering the increase of the many disorders under which the Church, particularly in this diocess, does sadly labour, judged that a representation of the evill of these disorders to the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, by the mediation of Lord Archbishop, would be the most efficient mean for the cure of them. \u2014 Of late, some persons of implacable enmity against the order and peace of this church, (the roughness and rancour of whose spirit does con temn all the lenities that are used for the smoothing and sweeting of it,) have presumed to abuse the mercy and indulgence of our so vereign, unto the acting of als high insolences against the worship and public service of God, his ministers who serve at his altar, and the discipline he has instituted, as ever have been suffered by any who have lived under the direction of good and wholesome laws"], [524, "506 APPENDIX. and the bounty and mercy of so gracious a prince. We humbly in treat your grace to present this our complaint unto the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, that they may move for the redress of these evils which press us so sore. These iniquities and abuses are specially these following :\u2014 1. The growth and increase of Popery, by the diligence and boldness of traffiquing papists, to the sedu cing ignorant and unstable people unto idolatry and superstition, together with the defection of some into quakerism. 2. The open and almost avowed contempt that is cast upon the public and so lemn worship of God, by deserting the public assemblies of the church established by law for the service of God, not only through a simple and negative secession from the communion of this church, but also by a frequent and open assembling by multitudes in the fields and private houses, in a direct and stated opposition unto the lawful assemblies of this church. It is also aggravated by several disorderly clandestine marriages, like as by the impudent and wil- ful refusal of delinquents to submit unto the just censures of this church, for scandalous miscarriages, condemned by the word of God and laws of this kingdom, by the licentiousness of persons openly profane, which may be, and are, encouraged by this ex- ample, by the unheard-of intrusion into, and invading the pulpits of the godly and orderly ministers of this church, and by the bar- barous profanation of places dedicate to the service of God. 3. The open and ordinary profanation of the Lord's day by persons who, pretending necessary dispatch of business, do cause great disturb ance in the several parishes through which the common road heth, by threating and forcing hirers of horse, boatmen, and other people, to serve their worldly lusts and designs. As also by the travelling of multitudes of people on the Lord's day, to conventicles at a great distance. This being the sad posture and state of affaris that this church is in, we could no longer forbear craving the assistance which the law of God does allow us, and the benevolence and fatherly care of our gracious Sovereign does invite and command us to call for, as often as we stand in need ; and do hereby, and by your Grace's mediation and earnest intercession, beg that the Lords of his Ma jesty's Privy Council would be pleased to examine the truth of tho particulars above-mentioned, and proceed accordingly against the course and torrent of these abuses, as they in wisdom judge most convenient, to remove the danger that the Protestant religion is in"], [525, "APPENDIX. 507 of being, as it were, a deluge of error, schism, profanity, and athe ibin, and to vindicate the authority and honour of our ministry from the fury and barbarity of those whose actings declare them implacable toward our persons, and irreconcileable unto the peace and order of this church, that we may be succoured in our stations so to behave in all the conduct of our affairs as it may never repent his Majesty or their Lordships of the favour and protection they have graciously granted unto us and the afflicted church whereof we are ministers and members. St Andrews, Sept. 2. 1680. The Archbishop and Synod being deeply sensible of the great discontentment the orderly and orthodox ministers labour under by reason of the many vagrant conventicle preachers and others that in certain places of this diocese, especiallie in Fife, doe keep week lie preachings in their houses, to the great disturbance of the peace and unity of the congregations where they reside, and the next ad jacent ; therefore its thought fit that the moderators of the several Presbyteries should give in to the clerk of the Synod a fist of the names of all such, whether iterant or settled, that his Grace may make use thereof as he shall find expedient. It being complained that in several places so many withdraw from the church and refuse to be examined, so that the ministers of these parishes are doubtful whether they shall administer the sacrament of the Eucharist ; its appointed that it shall be given to those who are desirous of the same, though they be but a few.* \" Great complaints are made at this period by the clergy in all parts of the country, that religious ordinances are ill attended, and that the public collections have fallen off, \" many persons giving but one copper doyt at their offering.\" For two or three years before the Restoration, the collec tion at the communion in the parish of St Andrews, amounted to \u00a3200 annually.

He died in great serenitie of soul. He had lived abroad such an ornament to his profession, as he was not more lamented by us than by all the seri ous English and Dutch of his acquaintance (who were many) as haveing lost the man, who as a mean was mad use of by the Lord to keep life amongst them ; yea, the poor ignorant people of the con gregation of Rotterdam (besids the more serious and knowing amongst them) bemoan his death, and their lose as of father. And they have good reason ; for I must say, he was the most faithfull, feckfull, compassionat, diligent, and indefatigable elder in the work of the Lord, that ever I knew at home or abroad ; and as for his care, solicitude, and concemednesse, in the work and people of God, I may say, the care of all the churches lay more upon him than upon hundreds of us, so that the Church of God hath lost more in the removeall of that man than most will suffer themselves to believe. Onely we who know it, have this to comfort Ourselves, that the re sidue of the spirit is with him quho made him such, and that the Great Intercessour lives to plead his own cause, and the causes of his peopls soul. I forgot to tell you, that when the cause for which he had suffered was mentioned, when it was scarce believed he understood or could speake, there was a sunshine of serene joy looked out of his countenance, and a lifting up of hands on high, as to receive the confessor's crown, togither with a lifting up of the the voice with an aha, as to sing the conquerour's song of victorie. And to close, I must tell you also, he lived and died in a deep de testation of that wretched indulgence, and of all the way es of sup porting it ; and this abrupt account of his death you may give to our friends. In a word, as a compound of all, he fell asleep in the furnace, walking with the Son of God, and now his bones will rise up with the bones of the other great witnesses hurried in a strange land, as a testimony against the wrong done to Christ, and the vio lence used against his followers by this wicked generation, whom the righteous Lord in his time, from him who sitteth upon the throne to the meanest instrument that hath put the mischeifs he framed into a law in execution, will make a generation of his wrath, of speciall wrath, which must answer and keep proportion unto the wrongs done to the Mediator.\u2014"], [535, "APPENDIX. 517 Macward to Mr Cargill, (Ibid. art. 94.)

Because of which, though my parents were persons of considerable worldly substance, yet they could not get the benefit of school education for their children, and so I got little or none but what I acquired at mine own hand when under my hideing. For before I was born, my father, with others, being set on by the enemy at Pentland-hills, 1666, when they were standing up in defence of the gospel, and was by the enemy routed, and many of them slain, and my father received wounds, but, lying close among the dead till night, got of with life. The enemy came to his house in quest of him, but missing him, they held a drawn sword to my mother's breast, who had me in her belly, threaten- ing to run her through unless she would discover her husband. She, weeping, told them, that for any thing she knew, he was killed, (for she had heard that it was so,) and that she had not seen him ; so they took what made for them in the house, and went off. But some days after, getting notice that he was still alive, they returned with greater fury then before, and threatened her with present death, first with a drawn sword at her breast, and also with a bended pistol ; and, contrair to all law divine and hu- mane, they dragged her alongst with them with a burning candle in her hand, through all the rooms of the maine house, and then through all the office-houses, they still rageing with their drawn swords and bended pistols ; but, after all their search, they missing my father, beat the servants, to strike the greater terrour on my mo- ther to tell where her husband was ; but she could not. Then they took a young man, called David Finlay, alongst with them to where their chief commander lay, called General Dalziel. He caused the said David Finlay to be shot to death in less then half ane hour's warning, and carried away all my father's stock of moveable effects, which was considerably great ; and for half a year there was hardly a day ever passed bot they were at the house, either in the night or day, in search of my father. \u2014 \u2014In the year 1678, there was a great host of Highlanders came down in the middle of the winter to the westren shires. The shire of Air was the centre of their encampment or cantooning, where they pillaged, plundered, theeved, and robbed night and day ; even"], [537, "APPENDIX. 519 the Lord's day they regarded as little as any other. At their first coming, four of them came to my father's house, who was over seeing the making of his own malt ; they told him they were come to make the Fig (so they termed the Presbyterians) to take with God and the king. This they came over again and again. They pointed to their shoes, and said they would have the broge off his foot, and accordingly laid hands on him, but he threw himself out of their grips, and turning to a pitch-fork which was used at the stalking of his corn, and they having their broadswords drawn, cryed, \" Clymore,\" and made at him ; but he quickly drove them out of the kilne, and chaseing them all four a space from the house, knocked one of them to the ground. The next day about twen ty of them came to the house, but he not being at home, they told they were come to take the Fig and his arms. They plundered his house, as they did the house of every other man who was not con form to the then'laws ; and such was their theevish dispositions, antl so well versed were they at the second sight, that, let people hide never so well, these men would go as straight to where it was, whether beneath the ground or above, as though they had been at the putting of it there, search for it, dig it up, and away with it. \u2014 When my father came Qto Drumclog'], the good people who were met to hear sermon, and the enemy, were drawn up in battle array, in order to fight. Five or six of the gentlemen who came to hear sermon, that were most fit to command the country people, took upon them to command, because some of them had been for merly in the military, as likewise my father had been. Two of whom went to meet my father when within sight, and gave him an account how matters was, and pointed out to him where Mr King was guarded on the left of the enemy by ane officer and four dra goons, and the officer had orders to shoot Mr King if they lost, and tf the country people lost, all that was or should be taken prison ers was to be hanged immediately after battle. My father being a strong, bold, and resolate man, went on boldly and briskly in all the parts of the action, especially in the relief of Mr King, whom he set at liberty ; which boldness and activity of his was much taken notice of by the enemy. The enemy lost the day, and had \u25a0ibout 30 or 35 of their number slain, whereof, they said, my lather killed seven with his awn hand, which much exposed him and all his to their after revenging fury.\u2014"], [538, "520 APPENDIX. \u20141682.

Being the 14 year of my age, in July, one morning at five o'clock, I went out to a wood, and within a little I heard the sound of people among the trees drawing near to me. I looked up and saw men cloathed in red, and as I got to my feet, one of them bade me be shot. I said to him, \" What good will my blood do to you ?\" And when he cocked his pistol, another of them said, \" Hold, man, do not shoot the bonny lad.\" The man with the pistol said, \" He is a Whig ; I saw him on his knees.\" They asked my name, and I told them my new name. They said to one an other, they had none in their list of that name. They asked me, who learned me to pray. I told them, my Bible. He that com manded them, I think he was a serjeant, said, \" Since we have none of that name, let him alone.\" The first man that came unto me, swore again, that he would have me shot, but two of them would not let him. There was about twelve of them in all, but none of them spoke to me but three, and two of these were for spa ring my life, and so they went off and left me.\u2014 \u20141685, April -26. \u2014 In the morning the servants went to work in the fields, and I was with them. A little before nine of the clocl in the forenoon, we saw a troop of dragoons coming at the gallop. Mr Peden and these that was with him in the house fled, whicl we at work knew nothing of, but we ran every one as Providenc directed; and the watchful providence of God, which was evei"], [539, "APPENDIX. 521 kind to me, led me as by the hand to a moss near two miles from where we were working, to which moss Mr Peden, and those that were with him, were fled for shelter, which I knew nothing of. The way to it was very steep and ascending ground. Two of the dragoons pursued me very hard, but spying another man in their pursuit of me, him they pursued off at the right hand of my way : they fired at him, but it pleased the Lord he escaped at that time. Then other two of them came in chase of me. I was sore put to for my life. The day was very hot, the sun bright in my face, and the way mountainous, yet the Lord was very kind to me, and enabled me to run. I had many thoughts of turning to this or that way, and often I had thoughts of diving in moss- water pits, and saving my head in the rush bushes; and yet I was overpowered, beyond my inclination, to keep on in my way to the moss where Mr Peden and the rest were, at the edge of which there was a bogg or morass, about seven or eight yards broad, to which my good guardian kind Providence brought me at last ; and here the Lord was a present help in the time of need to me, for just as I was drawing myself out of the bogg by the heather of the moss, the two dragoons came to the other side of the bogg, and seeing they could not get through with their horses to me, they called on me, \" Stand, dog, and be shot.\" By this time I was got out of the bog to my knees on the heather. They fired upon me, but God directed the ball by my left ear, so close that it carried off some of my hair. I, finding that I had escaped the shott, ran farther into the moss, kind Providence leading me where Mr Peden, with about twenty more of the persecuted peeple, were, in meeting with whom I was gladly surprised ; but I was so outrun, that it was sometime before I coulel speak any. We stayetl there about three hours, till there came another troop of the enemy to join the first troop, and seeing them dismount their horses, to take the moss on their foot to search us out, after some firing on both sides, where was no execution done, we drew off, and travelled the midst of the moss. They see ing tills, horsed again, and pursued us by the edges of the moss ; but we allways kept ourselves on such ground where horses could not pass. We ran that day about thirty miles, the enemy still pur suing us. We got no manner of refreshment all that day but moss water, till night, that each of us got a drink of milk. Mr Peden left these that were with him, and went one way, and I left them"], [540, "522 APPENDIX. and went another way. I lay all night far from any house, amongst heather ; to-morrow, when I awaked, after the sun arose, I saw about 200 horse and foot searching all the country far and near ; but I seeing no way of escape unobserved by the enemy, clapt closs amongst the heather ; and so kind and condescending was the Lord to me, that not one of the enemy did touch at the place where I lay.\u2014 \u2014 Within three or four days, Graham of Claverhouse, a violent persecutor, came for a general search with 100 horse and 300 High land men. They got sight of seven of us about the middle of the day. They pursued us all that day for thirty-two miles, till mid night, but the Lord preserved us from these blood-thirsty men. We got no refreshment all that day, except a few mouthfuls of bread and cheese and moss- water ; but the horse getting before us, and the foot being behind us, and we very much fatigued, we were brought to a straight what to resolve upon. But at last finding my comrades resolving still to run, I told them, that the Lord had pre served me these days past by running, but now, if he hid me not some other way, I must fall a sacrifice to the enemy ; so, after prayer, my friends and I parted in the fields before the sun rose. Then I went to as obscure a place as I could think on, and clapt as closs as I could. \u2014 The enemy pushed by me on both sides of the place where I lay, like sons of Lucifer, their father ; but He who made them held their eyes, that they saw me not, although they were three times within pistol-shot of me. \u2014 \u2014 After this I languished some days, and then was seized with a high and violent fever. I got in to a poor man's house, and his wife made me a bed in the byre, beside the cows, that her husband might not see me, that so he might be free to give his oath that he harboured no whiggs. The very next day, one Colonel Buchan came with two troops of dragoons to search that country a second time. He, with five more, dishorsed, and came into the poor cot tage where I was lying, and asked the poor woman, what men was in this den. She answered, she had no men, but a young lad of her own lying sick, at the point of death. Then they came where I was, and he lifted up my head by the hair, and a bended pistol in his right hand. He looked me broad in the face, and said to these that were with him, '* There is nothing here but a young creature dying ;\" and so let my head fall out of his hand and went awav ;"], [541, "APPENDIX. 523 but I was then so sick, that I was not capable of fear at the dan ger nor of joy at the escape. The poor woman conceived such fear, lest she came to trouble on my account, would not, for any per suasion, let me stay, and so I was carried a great way to another poor man's house. \u2014 No. XIII.
