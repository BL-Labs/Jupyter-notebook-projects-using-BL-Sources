This poem was written with the conviction that many of the great philosophical and re ligious questions which the scientific mind of the present day has condemned as being beyond the sphere of human inquiry, are nevertheless not only true but capable of demonstration, and are destined in time to be verified by science itself; the existence and nature, for example, of the Supreme Spirit of the universe, the fact of a future life, the unity of the human and divine nature, the interdependence and brother hood of the infinite series of races that law and analogy compel us to believe people the uni verse, and other kindred doctrines. Instead of advocating this philosophy directly, from a didactic point of view, I have tried the experiment of giving it a new vitality by showing"], [14, "PREFACE. X it in action ; presenting it upon the living and moving stage of a dramatic poem. The scheme of the celestial spheres discussed in the opening scene of this poem, rests upon a belief in the necessary relation and corres pondence of the visible and invisible domains of nature, the responsive realms of one mar vellous and mystical whole; a subtle and ex quisite theory which has already received a certain amount of support from philosophical and scientific inquirers, and which here at least is accepted without reserve. The knowledge which we can now claim to possess of the plu rality of worlds \u2014 the very doctrine, by the way, which Giordano Bruno, whose noble words stand upon my title page, was burnt to death for proclaiming \u2014 renders it inevitable almost, if we believe at all in a future life, that we should admit the corresponding fact of a plurality of heavens. This hypothesis is adopted in the accompanying poem, and the sphere which is its theatre of action is presented as the heaven merely of our own planet."], [15, "PREFACE. XI The political doctrine advanced in the second scene is again an application of one of the fundamental principles of the same philosophy, a belief in the nobility, dignity and freedom of human nature ; while it carries moreover to its logical conclusion the theory of the organic unity of the race, taught by Auguste Comte and earlier writers. When a race considered as an organism, a collective and universal being, the humanity of modern scientific wor ship, has attained a high degree of civilization, it is required according to the doctrine here insisted upon, to organize a social condition befitting its power and maturity ; an era of peace and order that will prove the fulfilment of the prophecy of early ages ; and failing to make this transition, it will be doomed to de terioration and decay ; just as the individual who becomes a man must forego the follies of youth and enter upon a noble and honour able career, at the cost of losing his repu tation and finding his life branded with the stigma of failure and defeat."], [16, "XII PREFACE. The revolutionary movement of thirty years ago is assumed, not without justification from the facts of history, to have been the first decisive effort of the European nations to initiate this great reform. The effort failed in consequence of the blindness and apathy of the governments, and that failure was marked by the fall of Mazzini in Rome, and the triumph of Louis Napoleon in Paris. We are now reaping in the whirlwind the bitter fruits of the seeds that were then sown upon the wind, and the real problem confronting the statesmen of our own day is to retrieve the defeat of that frustrate revolution, to escape from the epoch of retrogression and violence into which we then entered, and inaugurate even at this late day the era of peace and brother hood upon which the welfare of the future depends.

XIII experiences of Hesperus in the Ethereal Sphere to which he ascends when killed at the siege of Rome, and the life of Vittoria Piombini, swayed and coloured by the opposing influences of her good and evil genius, Hesperus and Federico. My aim in these poems will be, I need scarcely say, to make them depend entirely for their interest and claim to attention upon their in trinsic poetic merit, the force and dramatic truth with which they are presented ; while at the same time the scheme proposed will call for a discussion in them of questions of most deep and vital significance. The sublime and pathetic scenes of the initiation of Hesperus in heaven, should I succeed in doing justice to my own vision of that great theme, must, as it seems to me, cast a new light upon the whole subject of a future life and others of equal importance.

An author must be excused for falling in love with his own conceptions while in the act of com position, and I confess that this scene was written with a great elation of spirit, and in the full persuasion that it could not fail to produce an effect in inducing a better order of things upon our own planet.
