CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR '54. Thirty-seven years do not seem a long time. They only serve to number the years of the life of a man in his prime. Many of us can not only look back so far with ease, we were grown men and women then, though we were still young enough to make huge mistakes. But even thirty-seven years ago many things were different from what they are to-day. This was par ticularly true of a quiet little country town like Craigross. It had so little traffic that not even the wild sanguineness of the greatest railway maniac in the district had succeeded, in the fierce heat of the railway mania nearly a dozen years before, in doing more than laying down a badly-paying line, and erecting a generally empty station at a point three miles distant. Thus Craigross was left more primitive and un- K"], [14, "WAR TIMES. 2 sophisticated than most towns of its size and age, while the chief distinctions of its streets were their cleanness and quietness. But if it had no trade and little stir, it was by no means without spirit, and a proper sense of its importance. It took its stand \u2014 not on its natural surroundings, which, though pleasant, were not remarkable \u2014 but on its antiquity, which was vouched for in old records, and its good society, or, if the word may be pardoned, its gentility, its dear old-fashioned gentility. As it is with the society of Craigross that the fol lowing pages have to do, it is necessary to enter into some details where the townsfolk are concerned, and to point out the notabilities. The great Laird, who owned a large proportion of the land around, was not, strictly speaking, a towns man ; but if he did not count on the score of equality, he counted on the ground of superiority. John Mow bray of Drumbarns, and his wife, Lady Caroline, who was a marquis's daughter, were socially a great many flights higher than the region occupied by the chief inhabitants of the little town. The Mowbrays went to London nearly every season. Lady Caroline pre sented her daughters at Court, as the natives of Craigross read with interest and satisfaction in those items of intelligence from the Court fournal which were copied into the county paper. Mr. Mowbray was not in the House, but he figured, as was meet, at"], [15, "CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR '54. 3 any function \u2014 such as the meetings and dinners of the Caledonian Society, where distinguished Scotch men played their part in the metropolis. The young Laird was seeing the world in Her Majesty's Guards \u2014 no other regiment in the service befitted his claims. Intellectually and morally the Mowbrays' superiority was not so clear as it was socially. The Laird was reported, by those who had to do with him personally, to be a narrow-minded man, of fidgety habits and un certain temper. It was difficult for those connected with him in business, for his household, even for his family, to get on with him. Lady Caroline had long ago relinquished the attempt to satisfy a man who declined to be satisfied, but her proud, self-centred nature found other sources of worry and anxiety. In spite of the large landed property, which was very dear to John Mowbray, of which he would not sell an unentailed acre, ready money was scarce at Drum barns. The estate was heavily bonded and mort gaged. The precarious prospects of the younger son, a delicate lad just out of his teens, and of several daughters, together with the constant strain on the heads of the house to maintain the establishment as they conceived it ought to be maintained, were quite enough to account for the lines on her ladyship's thin, fine face. But though the Mowbrays were not to be included in Craigross society, it would be a mistake to suppose b 2"], [16, "WAR TIMES. 4 that the relations between Drumbarns and the town were not of a perfectly friendly character. Even so few as thirty-seven years ago the demarcations of rank were drawn with some strength, and were generally acknowledged. It was not merely the respectable shop-people, expectant of patronage, who looked up to the Drumbarns family. The feudal feeling was extant in more than the old ladies, who took a modest pride in seeing the Drumbarns car riage with its crest standing at this shop door or that, while Lady Caroline did her shopping ; or the young ladies from Drumbarns, in their well-fitting habits, with the bunches of cocks' feathers in their tall Tyro lean hats, riding up the street escorted by their father, or by one of their brothers, or by an elderly groom ; or the Laird himself, condescending to have an inter view with his saddler, or to attend the weekly market in order to ascertain the price of grain, and to eat his luncheon in the dignified retirement of the best private room in the Royal Arms Hotel. The town magnates were quite content to be noticed at a re spectful distance by the Mowbrays, bidden to Drum barns along with the parish minister and the principal doctor, to help to grace tenants' dinners and dances and semi-political gatherings. Captain Thomas Lumsden of the Moat, by virtue of his pretensions to be an officer, took precedence of the other gentlemen in Craigross. Yet when it came"], [17, "CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR 54. 5 to that, though he belonged to one of the smaller county families \u2014 the old Lumsdens of Lumgair \u2014 he had never held a commission in Her Majesty's ser vice, or in that of her predecessors ; he had been merely the captain of an East-Indiaman. But a great East-Indiaman, the most majestic of merchant ships in the days of long voyages, when \" John Com pany \" still ruled the roost, was not a vessel to be despised, neither was its captain anything else than a man of mark and potency. Nobody who had the pleasure of Captain Lumsden's acquaintance, least of all Captain Lumsden himself, ever doubted that he was \" an officer and a gentleman.\" He was a short, stout, red-faced man, who walked with an inevitable strut and roll in combination, as if he was still treading his old quarter-deck. He had a kind heart, and a choleric temper, with a dash of the rough bluster which used to be the common accompaniment of a sailor. Nobody was better liked in the place, for his blunt and somewhat domineering self-assertion was counterbalanced by his hearty hospitality and open handed generosity. Mrs. Lumsden was not half so popular a person as her husband was. If he was short and square, she was shorter and squarer, well-nigh to dwarfishness. She had been compared in personal appearance to Sydney Lady Morgan. In face Mrs. Lumsden had the disproportionately large head which is often"], [18, "6 WAR TIMES. present in deformity. The long face, surmounted by the leech-like, glossy back comb-curls, which elderly ladies still affected, was lantern-jawed and hard favoured. But what Mrs. Lumsden lacked in good looks she made up for in airs and graces, or, properly speaking, grimaces. Surely the affectation of thirty seven years ago was more pronounced in its absurdity than is the affectation of to-day. Never were two fairly well-disposed persons more unlike than were Captain and Mrs. Lumsden. The story went that their marriage was an accident, the result of propinquity and his goodness of heart. Mrs. Lumsden had been the heroine of a tragedy, though she did not look like it. She had gone out to India in the captain's ship for the purpose of being married to a man who perjured himself, whom she found already married when she landed at Calcutta. There was no resource for her save to return to England with the ship in which she had sailed from it, getting credit for her passage money till she should reach her relatives. Her sole friend was the kindly, manly cap tain. When he saw how her mortification, instead of decreasing rather increased as the months rolled by, because she shrank from encountering the family circle she had taken leave of under very different cir cumstances, Captain Lumsden could stand it no longer. He bluffly proposed to marry her himself, and thus save her from the ordeal she dreaded."], [19, "CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR '54. 7 One would have thought Mrs. Lumsden's gratitude would have lasted her life, but it would seem the poor lady was able to persuade herself that the captain had been sighing and dying for her during all the months she had sailed under his guardianship, and that she did him a great honour when she consented to accept the offer of his hand and heart. Captain Lumsdcin in spite of his irascibility and the provocation he re ceived, never undeceived her. Certainly Mrs. Lumsden's crotchets and caprices were thorns in her husband's flesh, as his loudness and roughness were trials to her more delicate perceptions. At first the lady had the better of it, for not only was she understood to be mistress of the complicated science of \" nagging,\" the moment she had recourse to tears as an argument the inherent softness of the captain's heart placed him at a serious disadvantage. But in time he asserted his natural supremacy. They were an honest, far from ill-intentioned pair, after all. Years mellowed their peculiarities, and welded to gether more closely those higher principles and better impulses in which husband and wife had a common meeting-ground. Use and wont wove their threads to attach the couple, until what had been unseemly and perilous contention to start with, dwindled down to not unfriendly and half playful bickering ; above all, the powerful tie supplied by the two children God had given them soldered their union indissolubly."], [20, "8 WAR TIMES. Archie Lumsden, the captain's boy, was a fine young fellow. He was not so many feet in height as he could have wished, but he had a depth and sonorousness of voice which might have belonged to a giant. What was more to the purpose, it was the expression of a truly heroic, joyous young soul. He was already a lieutenant in one of Her Majesty's regiments of foot, and the captain meant him. to be a general before he died. Maggie Lumsden was more like her father than her mother in character, with all his hectoring ways softened into a sensible girl's straightforwardness and shrewdness. She was not unlike her mother person ally, but by one of those pleasant freaks of nature, which are not very rare, Maggie's was a curiously comely replica of the original. There was no hint of deformity in her low stature, it had even a dignity and vigour of its own. Nobody could have called her rather large face hard-favoured, it was simply \" sonsie,\" while her long-lashed gray eyes and abun dant dark hair made an approach to the magnificent. The Lumsdens' house, which bore the name of the \" Moat,\" to the delight of the town antiquarians, was in itself not more than a century old \u2014 a comfortable, old-fashioned house, standing in a large walled gar den on the southern outskirts of Craigross. There was only one other house quite on an equality with the Moat, and that was the \" Saughs.\" It hap-"], [21, "CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR 54. 9 pened to belong to a widowed sister of Captain Lumsden's. Her husband had been purser in the same ship of which her brother was captain, and Mr. Hume, well connected too in his way, had, like Cap- tain Lumsden, retired to Craigross with a considerable fortune. The Saughs was a rough-dashed white house, \" built off \" the principal street, to which it presented a pair of aristocratic-looking stone pillars, crowned with stone pine-apples, a handsome iron gate and railing, and a couple of large, if somewhat dilapidated, willow trees. Mrs. Hume had, as a woman of thirty, married an ailing man twenty years her senior. She had been a dutiful, attentive wife, and on his death had reaped certain dubious fruits of her merits. He had left her in entire possession of his fortune, with complete control over it, though the couple were not childless. They had one child, Wat, a manly lad of three-and-twenty, who, by his father's will, was entirely dependent on his mother. As it chanced, unlimited power did not agree with Mrs. Hume. She was like her brother, inclined to be a despot ; but whereas Captain Lumsden had been under a thousand re- straints from intercourse with the world, official laws and precedents, etc., etc., there had been little or no check on Mrs. Hume. Her heart was in the right place, and it was never supposed that she had not a mother's regard for her son ; but she was a woman of cold manners, who did not readily show her feel-"], [22, "WAR TIMES. 10 ings. She desired to keep her boy tied to her apron strings, and she was not inclined to relax the tension of these strings where his restive head was concerned. She would not give him a profession, and she thwarted him in the desire of his heart, which was to take into his own hands his late father's property of Sandy Knowes and farm the acres. Her refusal was pro bably founded on the fact that there was a small mansion-house on Sandy Knowes, in which Wat might choose to set up a separate establishment. Anyhow, she left him stranded with regard to the slightest prospect of achieving independence in her lifetime. The result was a violent quarrel between mother and son, on the back of which he quitted Craigross precipitately, and, as it was understood, with little or no money in his possession. Neither his mother nor anybody else in the town knew what had become of him afterwards. Yet Wat Hume had not been a vicious lad ; far from it. He was reckoned, apart from his hot, hasty tem per, \u2014 a defect which had been intensified by injudici ous repression and contradiction, \u2014 quite a promising young fellow, and he had been a good deal of a favourite in the town. The disaster which had be fallen him was generally deplored, by none more so than by his uncle, Captain Lumsden, who fretted and fumed over the fact that Wat had not come to him for advice and help. To have proposed, after the"], [23, "CRAIGROSS IN THE YEAR '54. 11 mischief was done, that the elder man should attempt to guide and subdue his sister, would have been equi valent to suggesting that fire and water should meet and act in harmony. The third family in Craigross \u2014 the head of which lived on his means and did not engage in any pro fession or trade \u2014 was that of the Colvilles. They oc cupied the Gable Cottage, which was reached, not by any of the main streets, but by the Bishop's Wynd. (It was long since there had been a bishop resident in Craigross ; he might have been coeval with the Moat, as it was first named.) Instead of Mrs. Hume's wrought-iron gates, the Colvilles could only boast a wicket in a green wooden paling. However, the Gable Cottage had always been considered \" a cottage of gentility,\" and its long straggling garden reached as far as the back portion of Mrs. Hume's grounds. Mr. Colville was a gentleman endowed with a very modest independence. In the interest of his large family, he had made a mild effort to increase his in come by speculating in railway shares, but at the first fall in the prices, his nervous, timid nature took alarm lest his children should be left, not merely with narrow means, but what was a great deal worse, with no means at all. He sold his shares and withdrew from such risks, contenting himself thenceforth with saving a little money by the practice of a rigid economy. He was a stooping, cadaverous, shy man,"], [24, "WAR TIMES. 12 scholarly after a fashion, whose books were sufficient occupation and interest for him. His wife was dead, his eldest daughter, Isabel, a girl of two-and-twcnty, managed the house and family, to the admiration of the old ladies in Craigross, whom she was constantly consulting in order to get hints from their greater experience. These high authorities had not such a good opinion of Aggie Colville, the second daughter. She found time for long walks, and could not discover a more profitable vent for her energy than was im plied in furious fits of intermittent gardening, when she worked \" like a man,\" or in fishing in the Craig Burn, which was a sport for a boy and not for a girl in the primitive public opinion of thirty-seven years ago. But there were some people in Craigross \u2014 among them Maggie Lumsden \u2014 who indignantly maintained that the Gable Cottage could not have got along in the world without young Aggie Colville. It was she who rose in the morning and started the Colville children for the Academy. It was she who sat up at night darning their stockings, and mending their frocks and jackets. It was she who remonstrated with her father on his increasing apprehensiveness and stubborn close-fistedness, and induced him to make the necessary outlays to defray the family's lawful expenses instead of suffering them to sink into a state of affronting and demoralising shabbiness. It"], [25, "CRAIGROSS IN IHE YEAR '54. 13 was Isabel who did all the trotting about, talking, and fussing ; it was Aggie who worked in the back ground, said nothing about it, and got no credit for it. Isabel Colville was a precise, consequential, very trim, very feminine figure, perpetually going about her business, which took her much into the familiar shops and houses of Craigross. Her face was rather pretty, in a fair-haired, pink and white, small-mouthed way ; the light blue eyes would have been pretty also, if they had not blinked continually. Aggie Colville's greatest admirer could not have called her pretty. There is nothing pretty about a tragedy queen, and at this stage of her history there was a little of the tragedy queen about Aggie's tall figure, black brows, and thin, pale face, with its finely-cut features. Tragedy queen air or not, Maggie Lumsden, who ought to have known something of her former school fellow and her intimate friend, insisted that Aggie Colville was not only the prosaic worker who put her shoulder to the wheel in the back-ground, she could be as merry as a cricket when she had the chance. Craigross had also, as a matter of course, its bankers and lawyers ; worthy family men, with whom we have not much to do. The principal medical man, Dr. Ewart, was a middle-aged bachelor \u2014 a circumstance which the ladies of Craigross could not"], [26, "WAR TIMES. 14 help regarding as a slight to them. Mr. Fowler, the parish minister, was a childless widower of twenty years' standing, but this the female mem bers of his flock regarded in the light of a tender compliment."], [27, "!5 CHAPTER II. how does the young laird fare? what word is there from the captain's archie ? It was on such a quiet community that the great news broke like a thunderbolt, as it broke over noisier, busier scenes, of war declared between Eng land \u2014 with France, Sardinia, and Turkey as allies on the one hand, and the great Empire of Russia alone on the other. There had been mutterings of the storm in antici pation for some time. In fact, the Russians and Turks were already at hard blows, with precedence on the Danube as the object for which they strove. The eyes of all Europe had been turned upon Silistria and its gallant defence. But that was still a war between foreigners, and though it was to the skill and valour of an Irishman, an Englishman, and a Scotch man that the raising ofthe siege by the Russians was large!}' due, Butler, Ballard, and Nasmyth fought as volunteers, and not as the representatives of the"], [28, "16 WAR TIMES. nation ; and it is one thing to hear thunder rumbling at a distance, and another to find it crashing over head ; one thing to be ready to faint, and quite another to faint outright (as Mrs. Lumsden and Dr. Ewart could have told). So it was one thing to talk of mis chief here and mischief there, and of rumours of war with which we had little to do, and something totally different to know beyond the possibility of doubt that the Russian Ambassador had left the country, and war had been proclaimed where the old Cross of Edinburgh had stood, and at synonymous points in London, and in all the principal towns of Great Bri tain and Ireland, with Berwick-on-Tweed thrown into the bargain. The effect was as when a blast is blown on a trumpet. Everybody started up to listen in breath less expectation. Every occupation was stayed to make room for the one engrossing interest. What a ferment of excitement arose in a twinkling. What nonsense was spoken of an end having come to the shop-keeping decade which was transforming English men into greedy, crafty traders, and nothing more. A great war was to afford a grand opportunity for the development of the heroic virtues. As a matter of course each tirade was wound up with abundant quotations from \" Maud.\" How high young hearts beat at the thought of national glory, and how the owners of the hearts"], [29, "HOW DOES THE YOUNG LAIRD FAR El 17 believed themselves ready to endure any loss and hardship \u2014 even to the horrors of an invasion of Eng land by the Russians (who had too much to do else where), for the sake of Old England's honour and renown. Eager spirits like ours in Craigross thought little beforehand of the heavy cost of war, even when it raged at a distance. It was of no avail that children continued to repeat on speech-days at the Academy Southey's conversation between grandsire and grandson, with little Peterkin's pertinent ques tions about the skull found on one of Marlborough's famous battlefields. It did not matter in the least that we had recited in our days the woes of \" The Orphan Boy,\" whose father had perished in a victory of Nelson's, for which London was illuminated, to the delight of the unconscious child, and that we had drawn copious tears from the eyes of our mothers and grandmothers by the recital. Experience will never be bought second-hand. Each generation must earn it for itself. The war fever, which may be periodically necessary in the body politic, that it may throw off in one fierce ailment a host of minor maladies, prevailed over the length and breadth of the land, from the palace of the Queen to the hut of the shepherd. Perhaps nobody thought or cared very much for the inde pendence of Turkey, which was our ostensible object ; it was \"our noble fleet,\" \"our gallant army,\" the c"], [30, "WAR TIMES. 18 \" meteor flag of England,\" once more floating in the breeze, which was on everybody's lips. The ancients \u2014 there were still a good many re maining among us thirty-seven years ago, who remembered the beginning of the century, and the last great European war in which England was a principal \u2014 were in the greatest request. Never had the tales of Boney, of battles and bivouacs, of London illuminated six nights in succession for victory after victory, of the visit of the allied sovereigns, etc., etc., been so universally popular. Now the younger generation was to have its innings, was to tremble or burn as the fortunes of war turned, was to hang on the tidings which the excited postman brought, was to laugh and weep over the incidents of the camp \u2014 ludicrous the one moment, pathetic the next. But not many people realised then that the Penin sular War, at its worst moments \u2014 during the dreary retreat to Corunna \u2014 when broken ranks of gaunt, weather-beaten men in rags and on short commons were lying in the lines before Torres Vedras, and pur suing the protracted Siege of Badajoz, was still war in a friendly country, which Great Britain was doing its best to rid of its enemy. It was war under the sunny skies, among the vineyards and orange-groves of Spain and Portugal. But war with Russia meant the hostile invasion of dominions which are well-nigh boundless, while their inhabitants are legion, rude and"], [31, "HOW DOES THE YOUNG LAIRD FARE? 19 savage many of them ; the wildest Cossack being furiously fanatic and passionately patriotic to the core. Then for the southern sunshine and the southern luxuriance of vegetation, even under neglect and devastation, there are the awful frost and snow of a climate which, speaking roughly, alternates between the heat of the torrid zone and the cold of the Arctic regions. Craigross felt itself at once plunged into the vortex of the time by the hostages it had given to the war. There was the young Laird of Drumbarns in the Guards. To show what the Queen and the country were prepared to do, even the Guards were ordered on active service. There was Archie Lumsden in his foot regiment, which was one of the first despatched to Varna ; there was Hugh Mowbray's servant, a Craigross man, son of Tammy Coutts the tailor \u2014 of all trades to produce a warrior. Wull Coutts had rebelled against sitting cross-legged on a board and plying the needle. Being a stalwart fellow of the necessary stature, he had succeeded, with the help of the Drumbarns patronage, in joining Hugh Mowbray in one of those crack battalions which are supposed to encircle the throne, and protect Her Majesty's person. When Wull Coutts had revisited Craigross in his splendid uniform, he had fairly \" dazzled the town,\" including his admiring father, who had never done c 2"], [32, "WAR TIMES. 20 \" upraising \" and descanting on the elegance and cost of his son's regimentals. Be sure other eyes than those of Tammy and Tammy's wife were dazzled. When Wull was known to have sailed \u2014 humble unit, for all his martial finery \u2014 in the great armament, the pillows of more than one simple lass in Craigross were plentifully bedewed with tears. No doubt Katie Carruthers, the daughter of \" the wife who sold meal and barley,\" indignantly claimed the sole right to weep ; but if Wull was not engaged to every girl of his rank in the town, it was at least something to have been looked upon with complacent eyes by a future hero, to have had so much as \" the word \" of becoming his choice. There was one other recognised offering from Craigross to the war, but he did not count for much, since he was only wild Sandy Wingate, who was in the habit of thrashing the long-suffering back of his wife Chirsty every time he got drunk \u2014 that was with out fail on the weekly receipt of his wages as a town scavenger. Having thrashed Chirsty rather worse than his wont, in fact to the verge of her life, he was had up before a bailie and imprisoned for three consecutive months to try if that would mend his manners. In high dudgeon at the liberty taken with his person, the first thing he did on his release was to enlist. The recruiting sergeant got a bad bargain, but as"], [33, "HOW DOES THE YOUNG LAIRD FARE I 21 recruits were in the utmost demand, Sandy's antece dents passed muster. Nobody, naturally, was better aware of Sandy's worthlessness than Chirsty. She was half-witted to begin with, poor thing, and there fore was not capable of appreciating the surpassing advantage of having a partner of any kind. Leading, practically, a single woman's life, so far as aid from her husband was concerned, she was only too glad to be rid of her bully and tyrant. She was content to earn her living, and that of her imbecile child, by standing all day at neighbouring wash-tubs, without the risk of being robbed and beaten on her return to her home. Craigross was very much affronted of Sandy Win gate as one of her table of warriors. But what would you have ? Sandy might fight with the best. A yielding spirit and a disregard for his personal advan tage had never been among his faults. Suddenly the railway station at Loanhead, three miles from Craigross, without so much as an omnibus to carry passengers to and from the town, grew quite a crowded and fashionable resort. This was a source of great pride to Peter Galloway, the station-master. Peter had been much uplifted by his promotion to the post, on the opening of this branch of the rail way six years before. He had been correspondingly depressed by the solitude and seclusion which de scended on him, his single porter, and couple of"], [34, "WAR TIMES. 22 \" halflins,\" after the novelty of \" the line \" as a mode of travel in the room of the brave old coaches began to pall on the stay-at-home townsfolk of Craigross. \" The line's looking up,\" Peter would say cheer fully ; \" there's whiles as gude as a dozen men and women on the platform, forby the leddies and gentle men in the waiting-room, all waiting for the arrival of the noon express.\" Peter did not stop to explain how the presence of the company was to benefit the line or the shareholders. The company had, with rare exceptions, nothing to do with the ticket-office ; they were only there to intercept letters and news papers that otherwise would not reach their owners till the next morning's delivery. There was only one postal delivery in Craigross in '54, and as a rule nobody saw the necessity for more. The persons who were sufficiently disengaged to walk or ride over to Loanhead in the middle of the day, and yet did not expect either letters or news papers to their own share, could always shout to the guard of the train, Was there any fresh word come from \"seat of war\"? What regiment wassailing next? Was there no news from the Baltic ? Fighting Charlie Napier would not let the grass grow under his heels before he had Cronstadt in his clutch.

Everyone knew that, \" poor body,\" if she happened to be the deputy sent by Mr. Mowbray, she would have to suffer \u2014 marquis's daughter though she was \u2014 for any delay ofthe train. \" Drumbarns is that michty,\" Peter would complain to those hearers in whom he could put implicit con fidence ; \" ye would think the whole earth and a' it contains is made for his convenience.

A PEAL OF BELLS. VEILED INQUIRIES AFTER A NAMELESS MAN. As everybody knows, the victory of the Alma followed close on the troops landing in the Crimea. That was the consolation for the dismal blunder of Varna ; and the proud impression prevailed in all quarters that Lord Raglan had only to strike a second blow when the war would be over, for the object aimed at would have been attained. The great fort which dominated the Black Sea would be in the allies' hands. A con fident rumour, which even the Queen and her Govern ment accepted, was widely spread that Sevastopol had fallen. Most of us know now that, in all probability, it would have so fallen, if the first instinct of a forced march and an immediate attack by land and sea on the part of the combined forces had been the natural sequel to the battle of the Alma But the cautious counsels and the intrigues of a crafty ally, who was a keen and unscrupulous rival prevailed."], [39, "A PEAL OF BELLS. 27 Not yet was the end. Only through much tribula tion was it to be reached at last. England was to learn her weakness as well as her strength. St. Arnaud and Raglan were each to yield his field marshal's baton to a mightier than he, even to the great Captain on the Pale Horse. The marvellous engineering feats of the Russian engineer Todleben (whose name was transformed in homely Scotch into that most domestic-sounding paraphrase, \" Toddle ben \") were to astonish the world. Hearts were to be broken ; long agonies endured ; deeds of heavenly mercy, no less than of daring courage, done cheerfully and unstintedly ; the whole generation startled into larger conceptions of duty purified by pain and suffer ing, before the French scaled the Malakoff and the Russians abandoned the Redan. No such ideas were entertained when the bells rang a merry peal for the victory of the Alma, when bonfires were kindled on unforbidden ground \u2014 such as the hill behind the Lumsdens' house, the Captain being the chief provider of the fuel ; when toasts were proposed, healths drunk, huzzas shouted till the shouters were hoarse. The Captain's copy of the Times travelled over half Craigross. When one comes to think of it, there were only two more copies in the town \u2014 that clubbed for by Dr. Ewart and Mr. Fowler, and Mrs. Hume's copy. Mrs. Hume was not of an expansive nature. She kept her Times to her-"], [40, "28 WAR TIMES. self, and read it in the cold formal solitude of her drawing-room. All lighter literature was cast aside for William Russell's eloquent descriptions and graphic details. Even invalids were propped up in bed to read the ac counts of the battle and to dwell with ghastly facina tion on the lists of the dead and wounded. Familiar names were there \u2014 not those of friends and associates, we were thankful to find, but still names that were known to us, some of them old historical names borne by members of this or that county family. These represented husbands and fathers, sons and brothers \u2014 gay young lads who had gone forth only the other day, high-spirited and light-hearted, calling back cheery last words to the mothers and sisters who clung to them. Where were they now, these intrepid spirits ? Stretched lifeless on the bloody, trampled turf, in lumbering ambulances, and on hospital stairs, on which many a weary load lay biting the dust and panting out existence, before order could be brought out of disorder, and scanty accommodation found, in the unaccustomed hurry and confusion, for our wounded soldiers. What tales were told of fearless encounter, patient submission, and generous self-denial !

Yes, the Duke only closed his glass and gave his curt command, \" Up, Guards, and at them ! \" as the long rainy Sunday was drawing on to the night for which he had longed. The old Imperial Guard had charged like the giant waves of a mighty sea, and been beaten back as from an impregnable rock. Uxbridge, leading the Duke's Guards, rode bareheaded, yet, though he left a leg behind him, he lived to be the old Marquis of Anglesea of half a century later. Yes, yes ; but two of our boys, fresh from their public school games, outran the stout sergeants told off to guard the subalterns who carried the colours, and passing through the hostile ranks of the Russians, actually stood for a few minutes \u2014 they alone of their comrades \u2014 on the heights of the Alma.

Providence had been kind to Craigross, as Craigross people said ; nobody connected with the town had come to grief so far as we knew. The cholera at Varna had spared each and all of the little contin gent, and so had the muskets and sabres at the Alma. Mrs. Hume bestirred herself to leave her house of the Saughs, which she seldom quitted, though she was neither very old nor very infirm, and walked in the solemn dignity which characterised all her movements to the Moat. She came ostensibly to inquire if Archie had written. Archie was understood to be a favourite with his aunt. He had never been subject to her. There was no struggle in his breast between filial affection and duty, and an outraged sense of what was due to justice and manly independence, he did not stand in awe of her, there was no constraint in their intercourse, and, as it is not unusual in such cir cumstances, the stern disciplinarian was won by the young man's fearless confidence and untroubled friend liness.

It had been to the credit of the two lads that they had continued good friends till shortly before Wat went, when a coolness had sprung up on his side, where his cousin was concerned. Mrs. Hume, a big, large-featured, sallow-faced woman, grandiose both in body and mind and corres pondingly ponderous to deal with, found little Mrs. Lumsden lying back in her chair, the round table beside her furnished with a glass of water, a bottle of sal volatile with a teaspoon in readiness, a bottle of strong smelling-salts, the lady's silver vinaigrette and a fan, though the month was Sep tember. Maggie Lumsden was in close attendance to dis pense any or all of these remedies, in case of need, to the overcome individual in the chair. Yet Mrs. Lumsden had forgotten everything about her heart and her pulse till within the last few minutes. She had been taken up with the contents of Archie's letter. The Captain still held it, and read afresh the principal passages as he paced up and down his wife's drawing-room.

Archie wrote a half-manly, half-boyish letter, not immaculate as a literary composition, but highly creditable in other respects. His father could not have thought more of it if it had been the most polite polished letter of the polite nineteenth century. Archie hovered between exultation at having a battle and victory to announce ; anxiety to let those at home know that he was \" all alive and kicking',' as he wrote in his haste, and a sudden sobering sense of the horror and sadness of war. \" It has already cost us some good officers and men,\" he wrote, \" one of them, Lewis of the Welsh Fusiliers, I knew to speak to. He was in our quarters just before the row began. He was shot in the neck \u2014 a sickening sight, I do not wish to see another sight of the kind, though I can look the Russians in the face when I meet them.\" \" Does he mention any person we know ? \" asked Mrs. Hume in her deliberate way, which lent a special importance to the remark, though it was vague enough. \" Do you mean young Mowbray, or his servant Coutts, the tailor's son ? \" inquired the Captain, turning briskly upon her. \"Well, I have a bowing acquaintance with the young Laird,\" said Mrs. Hume, allowing herself to smile stiffly, \" but I cannot say that Tammy Coutts's son is on my visiting list.\""], [45, "A PEAL OF BELLS. 33 \" Just what I should have said myself, Margery,\" snapped Mrs. Lumsden, raising herself with sudden and surprising alacrity ; \" Captain Lumsden has a shocking habit, of which I have never been able to break him;, long and hard as I have tried. He will mix up different classes in his mind, and speak as if he were Jack-fellow alike with all the tailors and bakers in the place.\" \" Tut, we are all Adam's sons when the deck is cleared for action,\" protested the incorrigible Captain. \" You may give over trying to mend my manners, Mrs. Lumsden. Who is it that you are inquiring after, Margery ? \" \" Oh, for nobody in particular,\" answered his sister more quickly than usual, and looking for some reason a little discomforted. \" I only thought Archie might come across a familiar face now and again, when he was away at the wars.\" \"Doubtless,\" replied the Captain, a trifle mystified. \" He could not have attended Edinburgh College as he did, without picking up plenty of companions from all parts of the country. Some of them must have entered the army, and be with the troops abroad at this great gathering to humble the Emperor of all the Russias, with his Tartars at his back. If we had old Dundonald with the fleet in the Mediterranean he would make short work of it.\" \" Aunt Hume,\" said Maggie Lumsden quickly, D"], [46, "WAR TIMES. 34 turning her intelligent eyes full on Mrs. Hume, \" you may depend upon it that if Archie should encounter anyone we have so much as heard of, he will be sure to mention it when he writes, though he has little time for writing, of course.

But I'm sure Wat would mean no harm, only he would not know what to do.\" \" It is like enough, with this war spirit abroad,\" reflected the Captain ; \" but as I don't believe he could have had a couple of shillings left of the miserably small allowance his mother made to him, if he went with his neighbours it could only have been in one way.

I'm thank ful that Archie has always had the instincts of a gentleman.\" \" The instincts of a gentleman are safest to be found in a lad who has been treated like a man, and allowed all reasonable power and liberty,\" retorted the Captain. \" Anyhow, there are worse deeds than to list or go before the mast, though the world chooses to brand them. But I'm concerned for the lad's mother, high-handed as she has been to him, in such uncertainty and suspense in these times. Poor woman ! \" The mother's heart in Mrs. Lumsden prevented her contradicting her husband here. Aggie Colville had twice taken Katie Carruthers's class for her in the Sabbath School. Aggie had no class of her own, because her sister Isabel had hers, and Mr. Colville, whose eyes were failing him, liked to have one of his elder daughters at home with him, to bear him company and read to him after Church time. But Aggie was so far disengaged that she could on occasions relieve an incapacitated teacher. She had done it twice for Katie Carruthers. The first time had been when Katie was so overwhelmed with D 2"], [48, "36 WAR TIMES. grief, on account of parting the day before from Wull Coutts, that it was feared she might be seized with an untimely fit of hysterical weeping, while hearing her row of little girls repeat their questions, texts, and paraphrases. The second time was because of the perturbation of joy aroused by a letter from the redoubtable Wull. He gave a flaming account of the battle of the Alma \u2014 a much more flaming account than that contained in the few constrained lines penned by his master, or even in Archie Lumsden's buoyant flourish of trumpets. Wull had indulged in a genuine turn for melodrama by giving his reader a taste not only of every gruesome detail which had come under his own observation, he had added what ever \" raw-head-and-bloody-bones \" creation of his comrades' imaginations had reached him. He had also, without the slightest intention of misrepresenta tion, made so much of himself and his master as the heroes of the battle, in which they had fought as mere auxiliaries of another detachment of the Guards, that it read as if Hugh Mowbray, younger, of Drumbarns, and his body-servant, William Coutts, and they alone, had by their sublime valour won the day for England and her allies. No wonder Katie Carruthers was half beside herself with mingled pride and terror \u2014 pride that her magni ficent Wull had performed such prodigies of daring, and terror that the next despatch might record him"], [49, "A PEAL OF BELLS. 37 as one of those mangled, tortured victims of the strife whom he had described only too graphically. Nothing more was wanted to upset poor Katie's simple excitable mind, in her large comely bod}-. Yet something was superadded by the jealous dis pleasure of Tammy Coutts and his wife that their Wull should write first \u2014 not to them, but to that \" saft tawpie and flinderkin lass Carruthers,\" who was no fit match for Wull. Truly there was as great danger of hysteric laughter in the second case as there had been of hysteric weep ing in the first. \" Katie, you are a happy girl,\" said Aggie Colville, with that piteous, sombre light for such young eyes in the troubled depths of hers. The two were standing for a moment, in the ex change of grateful thanks, and a quick refusal of thanks, on the step which led down into Mrs. Catruthers's shop. Most people in Craigross knew each other by sight and to speak a word to, in spite of Mrs. Lumsden's objections to such unceremonious fraternisations. Those connected with the Sabbath School had another bond of union. \"Eh! do you think I'm happy, Miss Aggie?\" asked Katie, wistfully, the ready tears rushing to her limpid blue eyes. \" Prood, aye, but happy \u2014 I dinna ken.

Eh ! it's a dear price to pay for glory. What if Wull should come hame wi' a wudden leg or but an arm ? \" \"What about it?\" cried Aggie in ready scorn. Again she added impulsively, \" You are a happy woman, Katie, I mean it. Has Wull Coutts spoken of any other Craigross man in his letters?\" inquired Aggie, turning her head aside. \" No ane but hissel and his maister, the young Laird. I'm thinking they twa were the foremost in the fecht, the Lord preserve them ! But maybe Maister Archie Lumsden wasna that far ahint them, though Wull had no time to tak' note of him,\" suggested Katie in an afterthought. Her comprehension was sharpened by fellow-feel ing, but it was not sufficiently sharpened to prevent her from falling into a popular error. \" Oh, Lieutenant Lumsden !\" said Aggie carelessly; I believe his father, the Captain, has heard from him.\" She did not continue the conversation. Why should she say to Katie the word which Katie could not say to herself? Why should she trouble to enter into an explanation which Katie in her happiness \u2014 that was half happiness, half misery \u2014 would not understand ? But Aggie told herself again, with strong significance as she turned away, \" Yes, Katie is a happy woman. Even if Wull were killed, she would be free to mourn"], [51, "A PEAL OF BELLS. 39 for him. There are other people who would have no right to mourn, who might not so much as know when the greatest loss in their lives befell them. He would never know how mistaken he had been. There would be no time to tell him and ask his forgiveness for pride and perversity. And just for that reason \" \u2014 Aggie's heart gave a despairing, faithless cry \u2014 \" he will never come back. Wull may return, and the others may see Craigross again, even a great brute of a man like Sandy Wingate, whose plundered and beaten wife, poor half-daft Chirsty, prays every night of her life, as she told me with her own lips, that her ill man may ' bide where he is.' But Sandy will come back, while those for whose safe home-coming men and women are wrestling in prayer, like the patriarch Jacob, from sunset till sunrise, will never, never return. It is a great mystery, and only God knows the meaning of it all.\""], [52, "40 CHAPTER IV. THE CHOLERA AND ONE OF ITS VICTIMS. THE cholera, which had so soon smitten the soldiers amidst the foul vapours rising round the camp pitched on the reedy marshy ground of Varna, with its blighed fig-trees and stunted olive-trees, was abroad in the green coverts and fresh stubble fields of England and on the breezy hillsides of Scotland. It was little matter that it was born in the East under sweltering heat, amidst the unspeakable filth of semi civilisation in the last stage of effeteness, worse than the rudest savagery. Once born it travels West to scourge the nations for their sinful sloth and selfish neglect of the great Creator's law of life and health. No disease of modern times has inspired such deep, wide-spread dread of the anguish of its throes, the swiftness of its work, the poison of its presence. True, there was, even in 1854, a modification of the extreme panic which had formerly anticipated and accompanied a visitation of the cholera. The exces-"], [53, "THE CHOLERA. 41 sive and useless precautions against the attacks of the epidemic where either intermitted or took a more reasonable form. The isolation of cases might still be tried, but improvised quarantine established by volunteer cordons round some ofthe infected districts was no longer attempted. The exclusion of the nearest relations from the patients, and their transfer to the care of doctors and cholera nurses alone, \u2014 an inhuman disruption of natural ties, which added one additional pang to death \u2014 ceased to be practised. All the dismal array of burning tar-barrels, all the little empirical devices of small bags containing morsels of camphor hung round the necks of the health}', were abandoned. People had grown wiser and cooler if not more courageous. The nature of the disease, its cause and limitations, were better understood, and with knowledge came comparative calmness and con fidence. Still a certain amount of fear of the cholera itiorbus, with an instinctive shrinking from personal contact with the ghastly assailant, was a common and par donable experience even in persons who were not cowards by nature, and who were futher fortified against the pestilence which walketh in darkness by religious faith. When it was known that there were cases of cholera \u2014 Asiatic, not British \u2014 in Craigross itself, it was not easy to resist the general consternation. The"], [54, "WAR TLMES. 42 disease, as usual, showed itself first in the poorest class, and crept, as was its wont also, along one side of the Craig Burn which traversed the lower quarters ofthe town. Dauvit Bogie's, the greengrocer's little shop, to which customers descended by a step, as the)' did to Mrs. Carruthers's, was perennially damp from its proximity to the water. It was also apt to be pervaded by the smell of stale vegetables and decay ing fruit in September. Nevertheless, the \" back shop,\" or single room behind, was at once the living room and sleeping apartment ofthe family, consisting of lame Dauvit, his sickly wife, and three children. What a thrill ran through Craigross when the in formation became public property that poor Dauvit, his wife, and one of the children had been stricken fatally at one swoop in the course of twelve hours, and within the next twelve hours were by the order of the magistrates laid to their rest in the old church yard, which, with the church, was itself in the centre of the town. The fine church-tower was an agreeable object in a picturesque light, and the townspeople were proud of it. The sanitary effect of the close proximity of the houses of the living to the graves of the dead had hardly yet been taken into considera tion. The faint-hearted in Craigross clung desperately to the trust that the cholera would be confined to a few cases in the humbler quarter by the water-side, and"], [55, "THE CHOLERA. 43 would not spread till it invaded the higher regions, literally and figuratively. It was, therefore, with quite a scared look that Isabel Colville hurried in from her morning's market ing, and sitting down on the first chair inside the dining-room door, with the pink fled from her cheeks, made a communication to her sister Aggie, who was putting the room to rights after the disper sion of the younger members of the family. \" What do you think, Aggie? Mrs. Hume has got the cholera ; she was seized during the night. It is not just a town's clash. I heard it from the Ferriers \u2014 I had stepped in to get the recipe for that ginger-pudding which Mrs. Ferrier promised me. Mr. Ferrier had seen Dr. Ewart as he passed. Is it not terribly alarming ? A house like the Saughs, a woman like Mrs. Hume, able-bodied and not so far up in years.\" Aggie had stopped aghast in her turn. \" It is dreadfully sad,\" she said in a low disturbed tone. \"Is she very ill ? A good house and a strong constitu tion should give her a better chance of recovery, but I don't know that they are everything.\" \" Aggie,\" said Isabel with decision, as she began to recover from the shock she had received, \"you'll see and keep Lindsay and Anne and the boys out of the garden, where they are for ever hunting for late berries.

Lindsay, Anne, and Johnnie and the rest mind you more than they mind me, though I'm the eldest, and it is not an easy task for a girl of my age to keep house for my father and the family. And, Aggie, you'll be more careful about swallowing those drops I brought in from the drug gist's, they say they are a sure preventive against the cholera. You are so careless and reckless I can never depend upon you any more than upon Alick and Jim.\" \" I don't suppose the soldiers in the Crimea are pro vided with drops to swallow as a specific against the cholera, though it is following them to the very field of battle,\" said Aggie with impatient bitterness. \"What does that matter to us?\" inquired Isabel stolidly ; \" what have we to do with the soldiers, who cannot expect to be attended to as if they were at home ? \" \" What have we to do indeed ? \" echoed Aggie, still with that suspicion of bitterness. \" Of course they laid their account to leave their comforts behind them,\" went on Isabel calmly ; \" and they are strong men with war for their trade. War means hardship, I fancy.\" \" You have not told me if Mrs. Hume is very ill,\" asked Aggie again, abruptly ; \" and did you hear who was with her ? \" \"She is about as ill as she can be, Dr. Ewart says."], [57, "THE CHOIERA. 45 I did not stop to inquire who was with her ; I daresay her relations, the Lumsdens, have been sent for, since nobody knows where Wat Hume is.

If her aunt dies, she will have to look after the mournings, since Mrs. Lumsden rarely crosses the door-step. Then Maggie will have to re ceive all the callers.\" \" Isabel ! \" cried Aggie with a gasp and a sharp ring in her naturally full-toned voice. \" What ? \" inquired Isabel in perfect unconscious ness ; then, as a dawning comprehension of Aggie's meaning crossed Isabel's dense and preoccupied mind, she added in an aggrieved tone, \" I said if Maggie's aunt died. Mrs. Hume is no friend of ours that we should get up a lamentation for her beforehand. She is merely a bowing acquaintance, and I believe she made some not at all nice remarks about you, when people were silly enough to couple your name with her nephew Archie's last year. Lately she has passed us as if we were so much dirt beneath her feet \u2014 a haughty, disagreeable woman, I call her ; why, her own son could not put up with her,\" finished Isabel triumphantly, her shallow nature roused into anima tion and asperity by the supposed wrong done to herself through the slight to her sister."], [58, "46 WAR TIMES. \" And you can say this when she is maybe dying up there at this moment ? \" cried Aggie, pointing through the back window to the garden which \" marched \" with the Saughs grounds, while her voice vibrated with keen reproach. A look of fright and annoyance passed across Isabel's usually complacent and assured face. \" I'm sure I don't wish to speak ill of anybody in extremity,\" she protested in an approach to a whimper. \" But it was you who led me on, Aggie, yes, indeed you did. You don't know how provoking you can be, or what a bad habit you have of catching people up. There, while I have my bonnet on, I think I'll just run up to Mrs. Dingwall's and consult her as to whether she knows anything else we can do. I have heard that some doctors hold you should avoid shell-fish in an unhealthy season like this, and other medical men are of opinion that you ought not to touch salad.\" \" Isabel would ' run out ' and consult Mrs. Ding wall and the Ferriers and the old Miss Beatsons, if they would consent to see her, as to whether she was not right in what she had done, and as to what she should do next, though we were all lying speechless,\" said Aggie with a restless movement while she listened to her sister closing the front door. \" But if it pleases her, if she finds comfort and strength in it, what harm is there ? \" with a quick sigh. Aggie began to walk up and down the room in her"], [59, "THE CHOLERA. 47 distress. \" Oh ! to think of his mother being taken away and no possibility of getting at him,\" she con sidered ; \" and what will he say if he should ever come back and hear that she was left in her last hours to servants \u2014 even to old May, who has been so long at the Saughs ? Dr. Ewart will be there, but he has his other patients to look after ; Mr. Fowler will call whenever he hears, but he too may be summoned to other deathbeds, if he can read or pray with men and women in the clutches of the cholera. I know Captain Lumsden is over in Edinburgh, which some folk will think a mercy, and she may be gone before her brother hears. Maggie will have enough to do with her mother, who will not let her out of her sight, though I believe Mrs. Lumsden had said less about her aches and pains since Archie went to the wars and the cholera came to the town.\" Aggie thought for a few minutes longer, then she raised her head, as if she had made up her mind. She walked quickly to the peg behind the garden door, took her garden bonnet from it and put it on, only pausing for another minute to call to Lindsay, a girl of fifteen. Lindsay was coming downstairs with all the leisurely deliberation of a girl who is not obliged to go to school all day but only attends classes in the after noon as a stage in growing up. \" Lindsay, will you leave your practising and look into father's room now and then, to see that his fire is burning, and that he"], [60, "48 WAR TIMES. does not want anything? I have to go out, and I may be away for some time.\" She did not wait to hear or reply to Lindsay's sur prised cross-questions. \" Where are you going, Aggie ; out at the garden door in your garden bonnet ? Are you meaning to get the rod out of the summer-house and take the back way to the barn to fish, and you without a jacket and in September? Are you setting out on one of your long walks in that guise, and it very like rain ? When will you be back ? \" Ay ; where was she going, and when would she be back ; and what might she not bring with her ? But she had taken her resolution ; it seemed right to her, and she dared not delay to balance duties and dangers. If she were not needed, she would return presently ; if she were needed, God would take care of her and hers. The Colvilles' long garden, the use of which Isabel had just forbidden to the family, was a place much frequented by the younger members out of school hours. The narrow bounds of the Gable Cottage caused its occupants to flow out of it whenever the weather permitted. In the late summer and the early autumn the attractions of strawberries, rasp berries, gooseberries, \"codlins,\" \" ribstons,\" \"jargo nelles,\" and \" moor-fowls' eggs \" were perennial and irresistible to youthful palates. Girls' skirts and"], [61, "THE CHOLERA. 49 boys' jackets were for ever to be seen caught in prickly and entangling localities. The garden work among the flower-beds, with the gathering of peas and beans as well as roses, fell largely to Aggie Colville's share. The Colvilles' staff of servants had dwindled down to a single maid servant and a boy, while Isabel conceived that talk ing \u2014 not working\u2014 combined with general superin tendence, constituted her honourable province. At the top of the Colvilles' garden was a little waste space, filled up by an osier-bed and a few elder bushes, while beyond was the low tumble-down wall, largely held together by ivy, which separated the cot tage garden from the washing-green and back premises of the Saughs. Mrs. Hume would not have consented to such a shabby and ruinous barrier on her side had there not been a time-out-of-mind dis pute about the exact boundary-line of each property. It would have been a ticklish matter, to which the practical Scotch mind was averse, to build a wall on debatable ground. Aggie Colville knew the particular spot well. She had resorted to it rarely of late, but half-a-dozen years back, when she and Isabel were still attending the Academy, it had been a daily occurrence for them to repair to the wall of demarcation. The girls had gone there, without let or hindrance, to compare notes on their lessons with the boy Wat Hume. Isabel and E"], [62, "WAR TIMES. 50 Aggie had got Wat to explain, by the help of his Latin, the difficulties in their French and Italian ; to sharpen their pencils ; to mark, with the aid of his compasses, the longitude and latitude of the maps the boys and girls alike were drawing. He would even put in the names of the principal mountains, rivers, and towns done in the ornamental printing which Wat had been neat-handed enough to acquire. Craigross had then an unusually fine Academy, which had replaced the parish school. It was already on the decline, as such academies were, for the most part, forty-five years ago, but Craigross Academy, by dint of the remoteness of the town and district, re mained in a comparatively flourishing condition longer than its neighbours. It was still supplied with good teachers, and it was still attended by the youth of both sexes belonging to the upper classes in the town. Some modification had been introduced into the old parish school arrangements. Little \" Jeannie Morrisons \" no longer sat side by side with their doughty champions, and paid back their protection in the playground, and their escort through the ill-lit streets and along the dark country roads on the winter afternoons, by assistance in school hours. For the girls, by dint of being more docile by nature, and because they entertained a livelier dread of\" pawmies,\" were, as a rule, more diligent students than the boys. The girls had latterly their own benches and their"], [63, "THE CHOLERA. 51 own sides of the schoolroom, like the women worship ping in various Christian churches. But boys and girls had the same tasks set to them in the branches which they learnt in common, and repeated their lessons, in rotation, in each other's hearing. The system had its advantages and its disadvantages \u2014 the latter probably more than counterbalancing the former. But one of the advantages among the nicer boys and girls was the establishment of brotherly and sisterly friendships, which often outlasted later more formal and artificial acquaintanceships, and survived the manifold changes of time. Such a friendship had subsisted between Wat Hume, somewhat solitary in his brotherless and sister less condition, and the Colville girls, especially Aggie. Wat may have grown up an unruly spirit, but his hot temper had not hindered him from being kind and gentle in his boyish manliness, always ready to use his superior strength and skill for the benefit of the girls who were his classmates \u2014 above all, for Aggie Colville. The two had been good friends till the dawning shyness of manhood and womanhood had separated them a little, and left room for another feeling, un dreamt of before, to spring up between them. Then Aggie took umbrage at some reported remarks of Mrs. Hume's, in which she spoke slightingly ofthe Colville girls, and put down authoritatively the remotest idea E2"], [64, "WAR TIMES. 52 of any future connection between the families. Wat for his part, took offence at the manner in which Aggie turned her back upon him, and not in coquetry, but in wounded self-respect and girlish disquiet, made a show of her preference for his cousin Archie Lumsden, her friend Maggie's brother, and another of Aggie Colville's old Academy contemporaries This was in defiance of the fact that the town had taken into its stupid head that there was \" something \" between Aggie Colville and Archie Lumsden. If Archie and she knew there was nothing, that seemed enough to her. Poor Aggie had only avoided Scylla in order to strike on Charybdis. In the first place, she did not escape a contest with Mrs. Hume by declining to have anything to say to her son, for Mrs. Hume was so unreasonable as to resent equally Aggie's intimacy with Archie. As for that little termagant, Mrs. Lums den, she was rendered all but speechless by the effrontery of any girl in Craigross who dared to set her cap at her son. It was dreadful to think, the Craigross gossips said generally, that a girl no older than Aggie Colville should be such a hardened flirt. She had no mother certainly, but then she had that nice, sensible elder sister Isabel. Aggie Colville proceeded to tell herself in all the tumultuous passion of youth that Wat Hume had no right to be offended, that it was insulting her to suggest that she did not know how to behave to Archie"], [65, "THE CHOLERA. 53 Lumsden or to any other man. She was not going to give up her friendship, dating from their school-days, with Archie Lumsden, as well as with his sister, for any rude furious Wat Hume. Archie was only home at intervals from his regiment to have his holiday in the old town. He was taking his pleasure without any real comprehension of the harm he was doing. The next event was Wat Hume's quarrel with his mother over some bone of contention known only to themselves. This was followed by his abrupt depar ture without word or sign. He had passed into as utter oblivion in those stirring times as if he had left the world in addition to Craigross. And now it was Mrs. Hume who was lying on the verge of death, at the Colvilles' gates, as it were, with nobody who had a greater interest in her than that felt by her servants to watch by her bed, hear her last request, and catch her passing breath."], [66, "<4 CHAPTER V. WHO NURSED MRS. HUME? The stones of the ivy-thatched wall between the higher reaches of the Colvilles' garden and Mrs. Hume's washing-green had long been loose and irregular. In places the stones projected and receded so as to form what children call \" steps and stairs.\" To those who were familiar with the exact situation of those \"steps and stairs,\" hidden from ordinary observation by the growth of the ivy, it was the easiest thing in the world to cross from the Humes' premises to the Colvilles', or vice versa. It did not want Wat's long legs and muscular activity to scale the barrier. Years ago Aggie Colville, a merry, light-footed girl in those days, had scrambled over to steal a march on Wat and scandalise Isabel, who had always an over powering sense of propriety. At this moment Aggie did not hesitate. She had not practised the trick since she wore long frocks, but she gathered up her skirts and climbed the wall"], [67, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME ? 55 without difficulty, necessity and determination increas ing her sure-footedness. She crossed the washing green, where clothes had been left hanging on the ropes to dry, though the shower which Lindsay had predicted was already beginning to patter on them, and entered the paved courtyard, with its pump-well in the centre and its rain-water barrel in one corner. There was nobody about, but the kitchen door stood open, and Aggie saw within, where Mrs. Hume's old May was on her knees stooping forward to the open grate (there were no close ranges with boilers in Craigross thirty-seven years ago), busily blowing the fire with the kitchen bellows, in order to hasten the boiling of the water in the kettle on the embers. Aggie knocked at the open door. \"Wha's there?\" inquired May, in a tone between exasperation and despair, without looking round, she was so bent on getting the water to boil. \" Wha's coming to the hoose the day, with the cholery in it ? We're thrang enough as it is, for I trow you're not coming to bide and lend us a hand.\" \" It is me, May,\" said Aggie, who was well known to the old woman, not only by near neighbourhood and old association, but because May's niece Mary was the Colvilles' maidservant. \" You, Miss Aggie ; preserve me ! \" cried May, with a start, turning round without rising from her knees, and showing a wrinkled face, ordinarily keen and"], [68, "WAR TIMES. 56 shrewd, but looking a little wild in the strait. \" This is no a place for you ; gang awa' this moment of time. Miss Colville canna ken you're here. Run when I tell you, like a biddable, sensible young leddy.\" But Aggie stood her ground. \" How is your mis tress, May? \" \"Weel, she's had an awfu' nicht, puir leddy,\" said May, unable to resist the relief of telling her troubles to a sympathetic listener, while she blew up the fire with redoubled energy. \" I thocht she was a wee better a while syne, and doverin' over into a sleep ; but I can see the seeckness is coming back, and I misdoot the spasms and cramps will follow. I lichted a fire in her room, but the chumley winna draw ; and that sorry Leezbeth has gane and let doon the kitchen fire while I was attending to the mistress. I ken the het fomentations will be ca'd for the next thing.\" Dr. Ewart's outward application was hot fomenta tions, when ice-bags down the spine were not so much as dreamt of by the faculty. \"Who is with Mrs. Hume?\" said Aggie Colville quickly. \"Where is Logan?\" naming the elderly man-servant and general factotum at the Saughs. \" Where is Babby? \" mentioning the remaining maid servant. \" And have any of the Lumsdens been here ? \" \" Leezbeth's with the mistress, but the silly thing's hardly fit to rub her hands or give her a drink.

What should sair her, the selfish piece, but to tak' to her bed hersel' and set up the cry that she's gotten the cholery next ? Cholery ! there's nae mair cholery about her than about me,\" broke off May, in strong contempt. \"There naething ails her save peety for hersel', no for the puir mistress in her extremity.\" \"And Logan?\" persisted Aggie. \" Logan has been awa' for medicine, and now he's gane to the station to telegraph for Captain Lumsden from Edinbury. I doot, I doot, it will be a' ower afore the Captain can come,\" and May hastily put the corner of her apron to her eyes. She recovered her self the next instant. \"Logan's but a man-body when he's here, and he's neither a doctor nor a minister, so though the cratur's willin' he's little gude. There, the water's on the bile, and I mun rin ; and rin you too. Miss Aggie, like a dearie. You'll forgie my want o' manners on a day like this. It is rale kind of you to come up the garden and loup the wa' to speer.

As sune as she heard the mistress was seized she said she was bund to see after her gude-sister \u2014 aye, did she \u2014 when the Captain was frae hame, and Maister Wat was gane \u2014 oh, gin he were here this day, Miss Aggie ! \" cried the old servant, while Aggie stood like a stone. \" Mistress Lumsden rose, and was being dressed, when she swarfed near awa', for her strength wasna equal to her speerit. Miss Lumsden durstna leave her ony mair than the minute she took to come across to speer for her auntie, and tell us to keep up oor hearts, and to give us the name of the street and the hotel the Captain bides at when he's in Edinbury. The water's bilin', and you maun gang, Miss Aggie Colville. Dinna stand crackin' here ony langer. Dinna keep me from the mistress, and dinna go on risking catch ing the infection, and letting me have your death on my head.\" Instead of going away, Aggie came farther into the kitchen and shut the door behind her. \" Listen, May,\" she said solemnly. \"I know there is no time to lose. I will not go. I mean to stay and help you as far as I can. I've known Mrs. Hume all my life \u2014not very well, perhaps, but Mr. Wat was at the Academy when my sister Isabel and I were there ;"], [71, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME! 59 and you mind, Ma)7, what friends we all were. Besides, I'm Maggy Lumsden's friend, and I can do in her stead what she would have done for her aunt had she been at liberty.\" \" Miss Aggie Colville, hae you ta'en leave o' your senses ? What about the infection you may carry back to your family ? Your sister would not be willin' to run sic a risk ; and what would Mr. Colville say?\" \" I'm not responsible to my sister,\" said Aggie quietly, \" and I'll answer to my father. I've no fear of infection, and I know Dr. Ewart does not believe in it. But I've thought it all out, whatever may happen. If I feel myself smitten I'll ask to be laid up here. There will be a nurse brought over from Edinburgh by that time. You'll not grudge the trouble, or refuse to give a look to me now and then,\" with a faint, forlorn smile. \" I ma)' as well die here, if I'm going to take the cholera and die of it, as down in our house yonder, and it will lessen the danger of the disease spreading, if there is a danger.\" \" Miss Aggie, Miss Aggie, you're ower wise and independent,\" protested May. \" If you'll not let me into the room I'll stand at the door, and I'll go your errands better than Lizbeth will in the state she's in. I'll bring up what you want from the kitchen, and keep in the fire, and be ready for anything,\" pleaded Aggie. \" But what if the mistress should get a glisk o'"], [72, "WAR TIMES. 60 you ? \" objected May. \" She's ower fu' o' her trouble, and ower spent, to notice muckle, but she has a' her wits about her yet. She never could bide strangers coming aboot her person, and I'm thinking she had nae great wark wi' you and your folk, if you'll excuse my saying sae, Miss Aggie,\" ended the old woman, after a second's hesitation. \" Never mind. I'll stand out of her sight. She may change her mind when she wants help,\" urged Aggie. \" Gin you wouldna mind puttin' on ane o' my working brats and mutches \u2014 there's a couple o' clean anes lyin' in that dresser-drawer,\" half yielded May, borne down by the pertinacity of the petitioner, \u2014 \" she micht pass you by.

The next moment Leezbeth came flying downstairs, but she was prevented from entering the kitchen by a simultaneous ring at the front door bell and the doctor's shout, \"It's me, the doctor!\" When Lizbeth let Dr. Ewart in he turned her back to help him and May in the sick-room, not being aware that there was fresh assistance at hand."], [73, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME ? 61 With a curious mixture of feelings, \u2014 half affront at the situation, whole resolution to carry through her enterprise, even a feeble sense of the absurdity of putting on a disguise, and such a disguise, \u2014 Aggie dressed herself to meet the sick woman's failing eyes, tied on the wide check apron, with its huge bib, over her dress, and put on the ample frilled cap, which not only hid her dark hair, her young face was wellnigh buried in it. Aggie was not sufficiently disengaged to think of it at the time, but it was a striking proof of how successfully she was made up, that when Lizbeth, blind with terror, rushed down again, crying, \" She's waur ! she's skirling' oot \u2014 her that was sae stoot hearted and prood. Wooman, gin the doctor's sent you, gang up at aince and see what you can do to help him and May, for I canna thole this fearsome wark ony langer.\" Aggie needed no second bidding. She had meant to stand behind the door or the curtain, to be there to fetch and carry \u2014 only to come forward if there were a call for her presence. The call was there and then ; she could not question it when she saw Mrs. Hume tossing and writhing in the iron grip of the fierce cramps which were racking her. Aggie thought no more of holding back, she was conscious only of a human creature in mortal anguish, of Wat's mother tortured beyond bearing. In an instant Aggie was by May's side, striving to obey the doctor's directions,"], [74, "62 WAR TIMES. taking in the dusky hue of the convulsed face which once seen can never be forgotten, rubbing the clay cold limbs, raising the head slipping from the pillow, holding the spoon or the glass till the doctor forced open the clenched teeth to administer the drug which might allay the paroxysm. The grim fight, sinking down every now and then else flesh and blood could not have held out, and then leaping up with fresh vigour, lasted for hours, while Aggie Colville took no note of time. Dr. Ewart stood at his post as far as his other duties would allow him. Mr. Fowler, true to his office, came, bringing with him a higher atmosphere which stilled the heart's tumult, and did something even to exorcise pain, while he clasped the clammy hand and sought to convey promises of deathless peace and life immortal to the dulled ear. So centred was the attention of all present on the life-and-death struggle that Aggie ceased to fear, or for that matter to care, for being recognised by any body, least of all by the eyes which were either distracted with torment or heavy in collapse. She had given up hoping for any words that might reach her which she would eagerly gather up and treasure, for the small chance of one day repeating them to quiet the storm of a son's remorse. Where was Wat now? He might at this very moment be passing, by the same same fiery passage which his mother was"], [75, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME! 63 called on to traverse, to that other world which seemed so near them. He might be lying white and stark, a nameless man, so far as his friends were concerned, on another Crimean battle-field. Aggie could hardly believe her cars when, in one of the intervals of suffering, just as Dr. Ewart had left the room to reply to an imperative summons from the family of another patient, and May was at the door taking a cup of beef-tea from Lizbeth's shaking fingers, Mrs. Hume's blue lips parted, and the mother in her muttered, without any reference to the woman's seisin nearly the old words of a parent's inexpressible sorrow and yearning, \" O Wat, my son, my son ! \" Aggie took an eager step forward, scarcely knowing what she did. Should she tell Mrs. Hume that she \u2014 Aggie \u2014 was sure that Wat loved his mother for all that had come and gone, and would never forgive himself for having left her in anger ? Should she beseech that mother to live for his sake that he might be saved from cruel self-reproach and misery ? But at that moment the doctor re-entered the room and May approached the bed. At last the stage of collapse in the patient was suc ceeded by that of feverish reaction ; but Mrs. Hume's constitution was so strong, and her former health \u2014 due to early hours and temperate habits \u2014 had been so sound, that Dr. Ewart was at last able to say he believed the worst was past, and he had great hope she would now pull through."], [76, "64 WAR TIMES. With that one of Mrs. Hume's nurses stole from the room and did not reappear. The same day Aggie Colville excused herself from being so late for dinner that it was not worth while to go through so much as the pretence of dining. Instead, she appeared at the tea-table in one of her summer frocks which had been washed, \" withered,\" and laid aside for the season. It was a proceeding which Isabel called in question as wasteful, since Aggie could not hope to \" dirty \" the frock \"out\" again. Mr. Fowler was an absent-minded and inobservant man. Dr. Ewart had his wits about him on all oc casions, and let few things slip. However, it was the minister who made a certain remark to the doctor as they were strolling together to the gate of the Saughs. They had been congratulating each other on the prospect of Mrs. Hume's recovery, not merely on the worthy lady's account, but because her recovery would be an encouragement to the quaking hearts in the town, since it would be a proof that the epidemic was (under Providence) amenable to medical skill like that of Dr. Ewart. \" I say, doctor,\" said Mr. Fowler, when he thought the doctor had crowed long enough on this point, \" who was the woman that was helping Mrs. Hume's May? I seem to recollect her face, yet I cannot get her name, if she is a parishioner of mine.\" Dr. Ewart faced round on the speaker. \" She is a"], [77, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME ? 65 parishioner of yours, my good sir,\" he said confidently, and with a twinkle in his steel-blue eyes. \" I am glad to hear it,\" answered the minister in the innocence of his heart, \" for she seemed to me a most capable person, calm and composed, for \u2014 I should sa)7, a youngish cummer in such trying circumstances.\" \" A youngish cummer ! \" repeated the doctor drily ; \" I agree with you, sir,\" and the twinkle in his eyes grew more marked as he gave a slight cough. \" She may be of help in other cases. Such a woman is invaluable in a season like this,\" went on the minister. \" No doubt ; but I make question whether she would give her attendance in other cases \u2014 I mean as a general rule,\" said the doctor. \" That's a pity,\" said the minister simply. \" But who is she, since you know her ? I daresay I have not to make her acquaintance if she is one of my parishioners ; but I should be glad to hear her name.\" \" It was one of Colville's daughters,\" blurted out the doctor. \" Not possible ! \" exclaimed the minister, stopping short in his great surprise. He was not without some personal dissatisfaction also. He began to take himself to task with one of those rapid leaps backward, which the mind will accomplish in a trice, F"], [78, "WAR TIMES. 66 for having failed to recognise a heroine. He had done worse \u2014 he had decidedly underrated her. Had he not allowed himself to be bored by her consequen tiality, her talkativeness, her irritating habit of turning midges into mountains ? \" Had you not on your spectacles, minister ? \" \" No, Ewart, I had not on my spectacles ; but I am certain you are mistaken.\" The minister began to rally his forces and take refuge in incredulity. \" I am clear the woman we are referring to must be several inches taller than Miss Colville. It is you who are labouring under a misconception.\" \" Not I,\" maintained the doctor dogmatically. \" Taller than Isabel Colville, I don't deny ; but it was Aggie Colville I was speaking of, and I take it she's cast in a bigger mould than her sister \u2014 soul as well as body.\" \" That may be,\" granted the wondering minister. \" The second girl is too shy for me to have any great knowledge of her, though she attended my classes regularly before joining the church, and I can call to mind now that she struck me as both earnest and intelligent. But what could bring her here this morning, and what could possess her to dress herself up like a guisard on so serious an occasion ? \" \" Oh, dear knows ! \" said the doctor in the jaunty tone he sometimes assumed. As he spoke he plucked a long yellow leaf from a hanging branch of the saugh"], [79, "WHO NURSED MRS. HUME ? 67 nearest him, and twirled it round his deft fingers into an imitation cigar. \" Who can pretend to get to the bottom of women's vagaries ? \" demanded the bachelor sardonically. \" I've heard there was some kind of love-making between her and young Lums den before he went abroad, and I know she's a great friend of his sister's. Mrs. Hume is Lumsden's aunt, and he is a favourite with her. Maybe if that reck less loon of a son of hers does not turn up in time, Archie may get all she has. She may have made her will already, for anything I can tell, and she has had a hard tussle to get back to life to-day,\" \" I do not like to hear interested motives made the ground of such deeds,\" said the minister gravely. \" I am not attributing interested motives,\" denied Dr. Ewart sharply. \" The lassie not only did her best to save Mrs. Hume's life, she evidently sought to keep from her, as well as from everybody else, that she had a hand in nursing her.\" \" It was a courageous and noble act,\" insisted the minister, growing warmer in his admiration. \" I shall tell the fine girl what I think of her. I should like to make use of what she did as an example to the unnatural cowards who are in danger of abandoning their own flesh and blood.\" \" Better not ; better let well alone,\" said the doctor with a cautious shrug of his shoulders, in company with an upward tilt of his long chin. \" It is no busi- f 2"], [80, "68 WAR TIMES. ness of yours and mine, you know, Fowler. The young lady evidently wishes to keep the matter in the dark, and trusts in a manner to our honour. Good-day to you, sir ; it is high time I was looking after my other patients.\""], [81, "69 CHAPTER VI. MORE TEALS OF BELLS \u2014 BEGINNING TO PAY THE COST. MORE peals of merry bells clanged and clashed on the drowsy stillness and autumnal decay of the close of that memorable year. Again and yet again there was national exultation over fresh tidings of victory \u2014 but not for the fall of the great fortress which the flower of the united armies of England and France went forth to conquer at a blow. The Malakhoff and the Redan stood as fast as Cronstadt, and that was likely to last the life of \" Fighting Charlie.\" In spite of his gallantry and pugnacity, Sir Charles Napier was doomed to share the fate of the warlike prince of satiric verse. He and his fleet sailed to the Baltic, and \u2014 ah, well ! they sailed back again without the loss of man or ship, because, as the best judges allowed, there was nothing else for them to do. Those seven great ships which the Russians sacri-"], [82, "WAR TIMES. 70 ficed immediately after the battle of the Alma, sinking them under the eyes of the invaders before the harbour mouth of Sevastopol, were better than any girdle of sunken rocks to prevent a close attack by sea as well as by land. On the 25th of October the Russians were repulsed at Balaclava ; on the 5th of November they attacked the besiegers once more in great force, and were beaten back at Inkermann. Even with war corres pondents at work, and telegraphic communication partially established, news did not travel quite so fast as it travels to-day, and tantalising rumours from neutral countries were often all that reached us for a time ; but the heart-stirring particulars did arrive at last. How much we had to talk about, and how much we did talk ! The fatal misunderstanding between Lords Lucan and Cardigan ; Captain Nolan, the bearer of the order to the general of the Light Cavalry Brigade, shot dead where he sat on his pant ing horse ; the famous charge, which the French officer called \" Magnificent, but not war.\" Then there were the stories to be treasured up of the heroes ; the leader's proud, brief protest, \" Here goes the last of the Cardigans \" ; the kindly thoughtfulness of one of our own Scotch lairds, when he pulled out his purse and flung it back to his countrymen, with the words, \" For the widows and orphans.\" The charge was not yet set in immortal verse, but we"], [83, "MORE PEALS OF BELLS. 71 knew how it would descend to posterity, for we lived in the days when \" Into the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell, Rode the Six Hundred.\" We hung spellbound over the incidents of Inker mann. The long, desperate struggle, begun in the white misty drizzle of the November morning, and not ended till the afternoon dusk was settling on the scene : the mighty multitude of grey-coated .Russians, with their patriotism and loyalty kindled into a fierce blaze by the knowledge that two of their Emperor's sons were in the camp ; the dogged bravery and fidelity of the defenders. In their ranks \u2014 the ranks of our people \u2014 no less than three generals fell that day, while a fourth received his death-wound. The first ofthe three was Sir George Cathcart, one of the old Renfrew Cathcarts, a Waterloo man, who had ridden as an aide-de-camp to the great Duke when Cathcart was a brave lad of twenty-one. He was a hardy veteran of sixty when he hurried home from Caffreland to take his place in the Crimea. He rests there fitly, one of the fourteen English officers \u2014 spoils of Inkermann. Ah ! the heaps of dead, and the horrors which began to haunt our imaginations. We required to remind each other, with glistening eyes and trembling voices, of young Sir Thomas Trowbridge, \" who had at Inkermann one leg and the foot of the other carried away by a round shot, and"], [84, "72 WAR TIMES. continued commanding his battery till the battle was over, refusing to be carried away, only desiring his shattered limbs to be raised, in order to prevent too great a h\u00e6morrhage.\" After that superb steadfast ness we should not have been surprised to hear, what eventually happened, that the maimed soldier sur vived to come home, to receive at the Queen's hand the Crimean medal, and to marry the faithful love of his youth. The other side of the shield was the maddened Russians stabbing and shooting, like bloodthirsty savages, the wounded English and French on the battlefields ; still worse, rewarding the very hands which sought to succour them with treacherous blows \u2014 the last efforts of dying men. We heard also, with deep grief and sore mortifica- tion, how the forty years' peace had disorganised our army, so far as its commissariat and transport service went. Carriage, clothing, food, the relief of the wounded \u2014 everything had sailed and miscarried ignominiously. The holes in the unmade road be- tween the harbour of Balaclava and the English camp were so many holes in our sympathetic hearts.

The sick without medicine or attend ance, poisoned by the foul air of the hospital, when it was reached, were so many personal rebukes to us. We wanted all the cheer or that wonderful rein forcement of our resources, supplied by the expe dition of the new St. Ursulas and their virgins, in the persons of the daughter of a Warwickshire squire and the daughter of an English bishop, \u2014 Florence Night ingale and Mary Stanley, \u2014 who, with their troops of ladies, went out at the call of Christian charity and flung their weak bodies into the breach, to do battle with the hydra-headed monster of deadly disease, wild confusion, dire disorder, and the old-fashioned prejudices of buckram, routine, and red-tapism, and, if God would, to heal the sick. It sounded to us, who had never heard of \"lad)' nurses,\" so wonderful that we could not at first com prehend it, and chattered of it, in our Isabel Colville way, as of something overbold and unfeminine, a sin against the gentle domesticities, till we grew wiser and learnt to call things by their right names. It was in connection with Sydney Herbert's measure and Florence Nightingale's mission that Mr. Fowler had a passage in one of his sermons which roused the curiosity of the entire town of Craigross. He had referred with the usual dignified official reticence which names no names, but is not the less full of earnest admiration and approval, to those"], [86, "WAR TIMES. 74 handmaids of the Lord in the latter days, who had gone like \" Deborah, \" and \"Jael,\" and \"Judith\" of old, to the help of their countrymen in their strait, yet, not like their forerunners to lead an avenging army or to slay an alien oppressor, but in the milder light of the Christian dispensation to solace and restore the stricken and afflicted, to pour oil and wine into their gaping wounds, and bring them out of the iron bondage of pain and the valley of the shadow of death. In the middle of the minister's peroration he suddenly broke off, as if impelled by an association too strong to be resisted. He spoke warmly of reserves of Christian heroism in the midst of them selves known only to a few, of brave services, mag nanimous sacrifices, and secret unconfessed martyr doms, on which the light of day and of fame would never rest ; they existed nevertheless in the eye of heaven, and the true soldiers of the cross would not miss their reward. \" What on earth was Fowler driving at in his sermon this morning ? \" asked Captain Lumsden in the bosom of his family ; \" who is the nonsuch in our midst ? Not you, Maggie ? \" addressing his daughter banteringly. \" I wonder your father can be so silly, putting non sense into a girl's conceited head ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Lumsden tartly, holding up her large head, and strutting in a feeble fashion, like a very broad-"], [87, "MORE PEALS OF BELLS. 75 shouldered, caustic, elderly fairy, as she crossed from her chair to her sofa ; \" I thought Mr. Fowler decidedly rhapsodical.\" \" Oh no ! it was not meant for me,\" said Maggie, speaking from her own honest conviction. \" What service have I ever rendered ? or what sacrifices have I made ? I have hardly so much as known trouble till our Archie went off to the wars. I should have wanted a long spoon, indeed, to have supped sorrow ; I only hope I'm sufficiently thankful. But I'll tell you, I should not be surprised if it were Aggie Colville that was spoken of, and that the minister has found out something about her.\" \" You are as silly as your father,\" grumbled Mrs. Lumsden. \" You are perfectly crazy about Aggie Colville. For my part I do not see anything remarkable about the girl, except that she has fallen off very much in her looks lately. She is as thin as a whipping-post, and one could wish rouge were in fashion again, to carry off her ' shilpetness.' She is getting absolutely cadaverous ; it gives an invalid a turn to look at her. Neither can I say that her con versation is more enlivening than her looks.\" \" Tut, tut ! she was wont to be a lively enough lassie,\" said the Captain in the spirit of contradiction. \" I used to enjoy contradicting her, and seeing how she woke up to defend her opinions. If she has grown so very ' dowff,' it must be a recent story.\""], [88, "76 WAR TIMES. \" I own she has not been herself lately,\" said Maggie regretfully ; \"but you do not know Aggie \u2014 not many people out of her family know her, and even at home you must ask Mr. Colville and the young girls and boys if you would learn what Aggie is worth. She does not do herself justice in com pany,\" went on Maggie with affectionate animation. \" Her cleverness goes for nothing. But she acts where another person would speak. Aggie Colville is as good as gold, and none will ever hear from her what she has to bear from the Colvilles' narrow means, and from Isabel's stupid dictatorialness and self-sufficiency. Then there is their father's de pression and timidity, and the thoughtlessness and head-strongness of her younger sisters and brothers. They would all run wild. They would neither be kept at school nor put into professions if it were not for Aggie.\" \" Why don't they quit Craigross and go elsewhere, to some big mercantile town where there would be openings of one kind or another for a poor set like them \u2014 offices for the boys and matches for the girls ? \" said Mrs, Lumsden with a supercilious ness which might have to do either with the un reasonable number and the disparaging poverty of the Colvilles, or the vulgarity of the \" big mercantile town \" which she had proposed as a \" refuge for the destitute.\""], [89, "MORE PEALS OF BELLS. 77 \" You forget, mother, that the younger members of the family cannot be called grown-up. Mr. Colville is not cut out for business, and he can live at a cheaper rate with his children in a little place like Craigross,\" said Maggie with anxious deprecation. \" Colville is a snool of a landlubber,\" observed the Captain, with, alas ! as great contempt as his wife had displayed, though it arose from a different cause. \" As if Aggie Colville had not enough to do and bear,\" insisted Maggie, carried away by her zeal for her friend. As Maggie spoke, her open, eloquent face, with the width between her fine eyes, and her luxuriant hair divided and passed behind the ears so as to leave the full brow bare, then coiled up simply enough at the back of the head, was more than that of the \" sonsy lassie,\" which the Captain would call her in proud humility. She looked the fine young crea ture she was ; for the moment she was downright beautiful. \" You remember the Colvilles' Uncle Jim, Mrs. Colville's brother, the doctor in the army who was so good to them, of whom they were all so fond?\" demanded Maggie. \" The last time he came down to Craigross he was labouring under an incurable disease which caused him excruciating pain, so that he was tempted to take opium in large quantities to dull it."], [90, "78 WAR TIMES. He was so changed that his nieces and nephews were frightened at him. I know Isabel was in terror, and went all over the town, telling his strange, alarming ways, and asking what they should do. But Aggie just stood by him. She would not leave him. She accompanied him in his long solitary walks, till, good walker as she is, she was nearly walked off her feet. I believe that was the beginning of her thinness. She used to get up at four o'clock in the morning \u2014 the Colvilles' servant, Mary, told Aunt Hume's old May \u2014 break up the kitchen fire and make coffee to carry to her uncle to comfort him, and to try and wean him from the drug that was stealing away his wits.\" \" Leal lass ! \" said Captain Lumsden emphatically. \" She ought not to have been allowed,\" protested Mrs. Lumsden indignantly, holding up her white, bony hands so as to exhibit to advantage her numerous rings, \" to have her rest broken at her age ! What was her father thinking of ? Girls need to be looked after. I don't know what they would not take upon themselves to do if they were not prevented.\" Then the pinch of these war times came closer and was drawn tighter, while over at Drumbarns there were death and lamentation. The young Laird was in the field, and was understood to be passing through its perils scatheless. His younger brother, a"], [91, "MORE PEALS OF BELLS. 79 delicate lad at the best, and the only other son of the house, fell sick at one of the English Universities. He was brought home, and cared for with all the vigilance and tenderness which might have been expected. Not only did Dr. Ewart ride out twice \u2014 thrice, a day ; physicians from Edinburgh, and finally from London, were summoned to the sick lad's aid. Day-nurses and night-nurses, valet and butler, waited on him ; his mother and sisters were at his beck and call. To do the Laird justice, he restrained his crusty and crotchety temper every time he went near his ailing son. His rooms were airy, his bed was soft, and hushed silence prevailed when silence was requisite for him. The most carefully selected medi cines, the most daintily prepared food, were offered to him with the regularity of clockwork. He was young, with an untried constitution and an un burdened mind. If ever a lad had a chance, surely he had. Mr. Mowbray could not believe that his younger son would not recover. But man proposes and God disposes. The young Laird was facing the tumult of battle among flying shot and shell. If he had not been in the lightning flash charge at Balaclava, he had stood the slow fires of Inkermann. He slept a broken sleep in a draughty tent, he snatched light and precarious meals, he took his turn in the trenches. Day and night the roar of the siege was around him, but"], [92, "80 WAR TIMES. so far as anybody heard, he was uninjured. And in what was, by comparison, the tranquillity and luxury, state and dignity of Drumbarns, his younger brother, Andrew, passed away. There was none now except Hugh, who was in the thick of the carnage of a destructive and prolonged war, to save the main line of the old Mowbrays of Drumbarns from be coming extinct. There were sceptics and malcon tents who were guilty of muttering that the extinction would not be a great national and local loss, that there \"had been more lost at Flodden.\" But the Laird did not think so, and there were many worthy people who were of his opinion."], [93, "81 CHAPTER VII. ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED \u2014 THE YOUNG LAIRD RECALLED. A NEWSPAPER with certain tidings came, as Peter Galloway had dreaded, one day when Maggie Lums den had been detained at home, and the Captain had taken his ride to the station at Loanhead alone. He tore open the newspaper on the spot, as he was in the habit of doing, and, dim as his eyes were, he did not fail to catch the familiar name in the list of dead and wounded. \" Captain Archibald Lumsden, of the Regiment of Foot, badly wounded in the sortie of the enemy on the night ofthe 17th.\" \" Captain Archibald Lumsden \" \u2014 that was the Captain's \" Archie,\" who had got his company within the last six weeks \u2014 the \" Archie Lumsden \" of all Craigross. \" Badly wounded \" might mean desolation to the Moat house and sorrow to the town. \" Galloway,\" the old man called out in a strange o"], [94, "82 WAR TIMES. voice, that did not sound like his own either to himself or to the listeners, \" my son is badly wounded.\" It belonged to the imperious social nature of the man to call on the world, as represented by Peter Galloway, who happened to be the most available person present, to share the pain and fear clutching at the Captain's heart, which a less unquestioningly despotic and frank tempered man would have buried in his breast as long as he could cover it up and hide it. \" Eh, Captain, I'm wae to hear it ! \" cried Peter in honest dismay and regret. \" Will you come into the room and sit doon ? There's speerits in my hoose. Jock Reddock will rin for a drap in a meenute. He'll tak' your powney. You'll no attempt to munt and ride hame to the puir leddies wi' sic a wecht on your mind. There's the ' White Yett's ' dugcairt brocht Will'm Anderson to the train to attend the Cattle Tryst. It's no started back, we'll borrow it. Ander son will be rale prood to lend it, and his man will gie you a lift to the toon.\" But the Captain was \" dour, dour \" in his trouble. He stuffed the newspaper into the pocket of his over coat, mounted his pony not more stiffly than he was wont, and trotted off, like the Trojan he was, on the three long miles. Peter Galloway, looking after the rider as far as he could see, and shaking his towsled head, told himself that if it were not for \" the public,\" whose safety depended upon him, he would up and"], [95, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 83 after the auld man, and bear him company whether he would or not. What cared Peter though the Captain were so far left to himself as to strike at his escort with his whip ? for, as everybody knew, he could not stand being crossed when his \" birse \" was up. As the Captain rode he hailed, without stopping, each acquaintance he met on the well-known road, which he had ceased to see. Between him and it there had come a blurred vision of a trampled waste and a prostrate figure borne along by his comrades, under the icy night wind. And still the Captain kept shouting in that unnatural strained falsetto, \" Hey, Marshall ! How do you do, Mrs. Whyte ? I've just heard my son is badly wounded.\" Each man and woman, who cried, \" Oh dear ! \" or \" Pity me ! \" or \" Eh sirs,\" turned and looked in terror after Captain Lumsden. His face was flushed a dark red, his eyes were glassy ; the spectators expected him to drop from his seat the next moment. But he kept up, and rode straight till he reached his own door, where the wail of the woman-servant, to whom he told his tale with the persistence of the Ancient Mariner, seemed to rouse him from his absorption. When she cried in shrill lamentation, \" Oh ! puir Maister Airchie, gin we but had him here again,\" \u2014 he said hoarsely, \" Whisht, my woman, make no din, lest it reach your mistress. It will do no good, and she does not like it.\" g 2"], [96, "84 WAR TLMES. But it was only when he was with his wife and daughter that they knew the worst that was to be told, that the Captain gave way and sank back in his chair, shaking in every stout limb ; so that their grief for Archie was merged in alarm for his father. Maggie threw her arms round him and drew his grizzled head to her breast, breathing into his ear tender words of hope and trust. \" Father, he will do well. He is in God's hands, whatever happens. Don't take it so to heart, for our sakes.\" Mrs. Lumsden rose up and stood by her husband's side \u2014 her head, with its imposing lace cap, scarcely reaching higher than his shoulder where he sat \u2014 their relative positions reversed, as had not occurred before in the whole course of their married life. \" Don't Thomas, don't. Our boy is not killed ; the paper did not even say ' mortally,' only ' badly wounded.' ' Badly ' does not mean more than ' seriously,' and how many soldiers seriously wounded recover ! See, I am quite composed. I will put my handkerchief dipped in vinegar on your poor forehead ; or will you try my salts ? \" The Captain recovered before long, and was so \" black ashamed \" of having broken down that nobody dared allude to the circumstance from that moment. Indeed, he professed to be utterly incredulous of any illness on his part. When the next posts came from the East in due"], [97, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 85 succession, with the consoling intelligence that Archie Lumsden was doing as well as could be expected, that he was in the way of recovery, that he was ordered home on sick leave with the next transport \u2014 Captain Lumsden said little or nothing of what his anxiety and apprehension had been, and not much even of his thankfulness. But interested observers noticed that the prayer which the Captain was in the habit of saying in the shelter of his hat, on his entrance into the church, as he stood bolt upright (like a deck watch, or a sentry on duty in the interval of his walk), was twice as long as it had been formerly. The Captain was never tired of expatiating on his preparations for Archie's reception and entertain ment, just as he was never weary of tramping up to his son's bedroom and the sitting-room which was to be fitted up and set apart for his accommodation, and overlooking the women's arrangements there. \" The rascal must be indulged a bit after his roughing, but he must not be worried and teased by too much coddling from his mother and sister ; me and Kinnaird \" (mentioning the groom and gardener in one ) \" will manage him. The fellow will prefer to have us about him. We must feed him up on beef steaks, and chops, and port and porter. Trash of slops and jellies are all very well for civilians, but they are not for either of the services, and we must"], [98, "86 WAR TIMES. look out that he does not get hipped, as youngsters \u2014 old ones, too, for that matter \u2014 who have been laid on their beam-ends for weeks are apt to be, when they're beginning to crawl about again. I've ordered an additional copy of the Gazette, and he can have as many ' campaigns ' from the library as he likes.\" Then a brilliant idea struck the Captain in his uxorious mood. \" I'll tell you what, we'll have little Hettie Nairne over from Edinburgh. The boy was always fond of his cousin Hettie. They were for ever running about together, or sparring and laughing in corners, when she was here during his leave two summers ago. Hettie can sing like a mavis ; she will make music for him, and keep him lively.\" Maggie made a very funny face at this suggestion, to which Mrs. Lumsden, for once, did not make any objection. Hetty Nairne was her niece, and her relations, like everything else which belonged to her, had a special sacredness to her. She had even been heard to say, with a complacent simper and her head on one side, that Hettie Nairne was not unlike what she \u2014 Mrs. Lumsden \u2014 had been at Hettie's age, \u2014 Hettie, whose smallness was sylph-like, whose soft, round, little face was rosy as the dawn ! Time must work wonders if it can convert a Hetty Nairne into a short, broad, large-headed, gaunt-faced Mrs. Lumsden. \" I don't mind Hettie's coming ; I should like it"], [99, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 87 very much, for my own part,\" said Maggie, with a temptation both to laugh and to blush. \" She is an obliging, kindhearted little thing. I believe she will do her best to please and divert Archie ; and he does like her, and does enjoy talking nonsense to her. But isn't it incurring responsibility to throw them together when she is so young, and his heart is softer than usual, and he has nothing else to occupy him ? Mayn't things happen which you would not altogether like ? \" For Maggie knew that Hettie Nairne had not a penny, and that the Captain and Mrs. Lumsden looked for great things in their daughter-in-law when Archie should marry. But the Captain and his wife were far too great autocrats in their different ways to imagine that any step which they chose to take could end in results not to their liking. They dismissed Maggie's halting, bashful warning with little short of disdain. Girls were so foolish, they were always looking out for love affairs and marriages. There was surely a wide difference between Hettie Nairne's making the time pass more quickly for a relative in the languor of sickness, chattering away to him and getting a laugh out of him, and he and she \u2014 little better than a schoolgirl as she was \u2014 being guilty of a silly en tanglement, with the prospect of an imprudent marriage. Even the Captain was resentful at the hinted suggestion. \" I thought you had more sense,"], [100, "88 WAR TIMES. Maggie ! What do you take Archie for? He is not a young fool, and he has seen something of the world. Even little Hettie, simple as she is, is not such a goose as that would come to.\" \" I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself, Maggie, to take such an idea into your head. You ought to put a higher value on your sex,\" here Mrs. Lumsden tossed her head and bridled, \" even if you are in different to your brother's comfort. To propose to prevent the poor dear boy's having the only change of company he is fit for, and getting the little amuse ment his cousin can give him, by starting such an absurd, such an indelicate bugbear ! \" Maggie was silenced as she might not have been if she had been less modest and forbearing. Hettie Nairne arrived to pay a long visit to the Moat, full of innocent pride and importance at being asked to help to nurse her cousin Archie returning wounded from the wars. She had every inclination for the task. Had not Archie and she had many a merry passage of arms together before now ? The day of Archie Lumsden's arrival came at last. Craigross would have been equal to the occasion, and would have made a demonstration. The town would have liked to send a deputation of the principal inhabitants to the station at Loanhead, in order to give a public welcome to a Crimean hero. They would have begged him to say on the spot when he"], [101, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 89 would consent to be made a burgess of the town, with the privilege of trading within its bounds, or a masonic brother, or whatever honour occurred to them. The)' would fain have borrowed the somewhat wheezy and broken-winded band of the Militia, that were being called out to take the place of the natural defenders of the country. The borrowed band ought to have employed its drum and fife, bugle and clarionet to \" discourse \" \" See the Conquering Hero Comes \" before Archie from the station to the Moat house. The popularity of Archie as well as of the Captain, the very loyalty of Craigross, seemed to demand something of the kind. But luckily there was a little common sense and consideration left in the towns people. They refrained from what would have been a great satisfaction to themselves on account of what they understood to be the shaky condition of the Conquering Hero. They did not even crowd to the station, to which the invalid's family had driven in one of the Royal Arms Hotel's \" chaises,\" as cabs were still called in Craigross thirty-seven years ago. It was to take back Archie and his father and mother. Maggie and Hettie would cheerfully consent to walk home after just setting eyes on their hero. They were now walking arm-in-arm behind Captain and Mrs. Lumsden, who were leading the promenade up and down the platform, to the great edification of Peter Galloway. \" Saw you ever the like ! \" he muttered"], [102, "90 WAR TIMES. to Jock Reddock, \" the Captain oxtering his little leddy as gin they were sweethearting ; sic a spectacle has not been seen, save on Sawbbath days \u2014 no since they settled at Craigross, and that is neither the day nor yesterday. I wuss my Nanny could slip out and spy the ferlic. I ken when I tell her she winna believe me ; she'll threep that I've made a mistake. For Madam hasna set her fit on the plainstanes, except to gang to the kirk, for a dizzen years. As for the kirk, she has to be drawn in her chair to the kirk door, and airmed up the stair to the last. Then she's that dune she canna ettle to look up the text or to stand up for the prayer. Eh, what winna a woman do for her lad bairn ? \" The only stranger who seemed likely to intrude on the family reunion was Mr. Mowbray, of Drumbarns. He, of all people present, ought to have known good manners. But he had become so possessed with the idea of the importance of the young Laird that he would not be restrained. He refused even more pettishly than was common with him to be turned aside from his purpose by Lady Caroline, who what ever crumbs of intelligence her mother's heart might crave, had done what she could to get her husband to defer his interview with Captain Lumsden to a more fitting time and place. The Laird had driven over to Loanhead, and was fidgeting about in his crape hat band, lying in wait to intercept a sick man at the last"], [103, "ARCHIE L UMSDEN INVALIDED. 91 gasp with weariness after his journey, in order to extract from him when he had seen and spoken with Hugh Mowbray. At last, before hearts could wear themselves out with quick throbbing, the train came in sight and drew up. There were no invalids' carriages in those days, at least none that touched at Loanhead, but the door of an ordinary first-class carriage was fumblingly opened, and a figure stepped slowly out. Could that tottering scarecrow, enveloped in greatcoat and wraps, be the brisk, smart, little fellow who had quitted us so lately? Why, he would have fallen as he alighted had not Dr. Ewart, old enough to be the lad's father, who had gone the last stage to meet him, leapt nimbly out after Archie, and gripped him by the nerveless arm. Nobody, not the mother who bore him, could realise his identity till the old trombone of a voice, with a crack and quaver in it, as in the voice of a man of fourscore, called out, \" Hallo, are you all there ? The governor, the mater, Maggie, and Cousin Hettie, too, I declare, all turned out to meet me. I am honoured ; and I'd make my best bow in return if I were sure of keeping my feet.\" Ah, yes ! that was Archie Lumsden all over, always with a cheery word to make light of his greatest tribulation, and a gay laugh to mask his deepest feel ings. Then the family group closed around him, and kissed and clung to him as far as Dr. Ewart would"], [104, "WAR TLMES. 92 permit ; and even the Laird could not find in his pre occupied heart to try the spent traveller further. But Mr. Mowbray would have his way in the long run. The mere sight of what war had reduced Archie Lumsden to only rendered the Laird more determined that, neither for the honour of the country nor for the young man's own credit, would he suffer his sole remaining son to continue longer with the army in the Crimea. There was no use in reminding him that, though his selfish conduct was not un paralleled, other fathers were risking their sons ; the humblest private in the ranks, which were dwindling ominously, could hardly fail to be, in the old homely pathetic phrase, \"somebody's body.\" Mr. Mowbray would have argued unmoved that they were not all only surviving sons, above all, they were not the last representatives in the main line of the Mowbrays of Drumbarns. The Laird pestered the authorities on every hand to procure his heir's recall. He harassed the very War Office \u2014 worried enough already with pertinacious representations and importunate requirements. If he had been as great a personage as another individual, who pursued a similar maddening course, so far as pressing private questions went, until these personal matters got shuffled and mixed up with weighty public concerns, there might have been a second \" Take care of Dowb ! \" flashed from west to east,"], [105, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 93 grafted into the centre of an official record, and given as public property to a bewildered nation, with all the ingenious explanations offered by clever editors and speculative correspondents. How that little piece of genteel comedy broke in upon the winter's tragedy ! How perplexing and inexplicable the sentence was till a shamefaced solution was given to the riddle, and then the baffled astonishment which had asked in vain whether \" Dowb \" were a cannon or a mine was succeeded by shouts of laughter. At last the principal persons engaged in the contro versy could hold out no longer. Young Mowbray was suffered to exchange into a home regiment. He was the last who yielded to the pressure put upon everybody by the Laird. Hugh Mowbray had certainly done enough to vindicate his character for courage and fidelity to his duties. He had seen very active service while it lasted, and shared in the hard ships to which the humblest of his father's servants, the poorest person in Craigross had never been exposed. But whatever his difficulties \u2014 and we under stood them better afterwards \u2014 he would fain have seen the campaign out. It was with openly-expressed reluctance that he submitted to his father's will, which was probably rendered more irksome in anticipa tion by the fact that the Laird had been more of a goading and exacting than of a kindly affcctioned or tenderly indulgent father. Hugh was as well"], [106, "WAR TIMES. 94 aware as anybody could be that it was family pride, and not paternal regard, which rendered his father so desperately anxious for his return. It was arranged that after such forms as could be complied with at the crisis, the young Laird was to follow Archie Lumsden, and reappear among us. The sole contributions which Craigross, to our know ledge, now supplied to the army before Sevastopol consisted of the trooper Wull Coutts and the repro bate Sandy Wingate. We were secretly a good deal ashamed of this falling-off. We did not blame Archie Lumsden ; he could not help it, neither could his family. He was \" a wife's ae son,\" as well as Hugh Mowbray, and it was unmistakable that he had had one of his feet in the grave, out of which he was scrambling, as fast as he could, by God's blessing, and with the help of the entire dedication to his interests of the household at the Moat, with pretty little Hetty Nairne thrown into the bargain. And already he was eagerly anticipating the day when the doctor would pass him, and he might return to the camp in its straits. But Hugh Mowbray was not only to exchange into a regiment within the bounds of Great Britain, he was, in case of further casualties, to sell out of the army without loss of time. How scornfully we talked of \" old wives \" who were not Lady Carolines, of how little after all the blood of"], [107, "ARCHIE LUMSDEN INVALIDED. 95 \" all the Howards \" could do at a pinch. We wondered what the young Laird's ancestors, who had fought at Flodden and Pinkie and Falkirk, and yet survived to hand down their name to posterity, would have thought of the extreme care taken of their degenerate descendant. Yes, and how sorry we were ; how we could have bitten our tongues out in the days which were to come for our hasty conclusions and hard judgments."], [108, "96 CHAPTER VIII. WHEN KNITTING WAS THE ORDER OF THE DAY, AND THE \" TIMES \" WAS READ ALOUD BY THE HOUR. The winter was a hard one with an unusual amount of frost and snow. But how could we think of our selves when every day brought us more heartrending details of the sufferings of our soldiers from the pens of William Russell and Archibald Forbes? We heard also from the mouths ofthe Commission sent out by Parliament and of the amateurs presenting them selves from the classes which command wealth and leisure, to enquire with no lack of fiery and generous zeal into the breakdown of our military system, which was on a par with the bravery and endurance of our troops. In the meantime every circle at home was full of plans and efforts for the relief of the men who were fighting our battles in an enemy's country, under the adverse circumstances of a rigorous climate, scanty food"], [109, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DA Y. 97 and clothing, and the grisly spectres of cholera and typhus dogging every movement ofthe army. We were ashamed to say that our fingers and toes tingled with the cold, or to grumble because the kitchen fire had been let low or piled too high, and our morning toast was tough or roasted instead of crisp and toasted, when we thought of those poor frost-bitten hands and feet of our brethren, and of that everlasting diet of hard biscuits and raw bacon, even when the coffee beans were brown instead of green, and ground ready for the use of men faint with exposure and want. Private no less than public enterprise began to be at work. A Scotch gentleman sent out sacks of oatmeal to replace the unwholesome fried bacon and biscuits. Scores of haggises were despatched to help some canny Scotchmen to keep their new year's day. How could we celebrate the daft days with even a semblance of glee, when we recalled the doleful plight of our countrymen far away ? Huge packing-cases stuffed with woollen goods of every description were committed to the charge of in dividual officers to replace the Government store, which had come to grief. In order to fill these packing-cases, not only were the looms of the manufacturers of cloth and hosiery put on extra time, \u2014 in every house, from palace to cottage, knitting went on among the women, as for dear life, we had almost said night and day. We girls of Craigross hardly needed as a stimulant to H"], [110, "WAR TIMES. 98 follow the good example that the last gift which Hugh Mowbray meant to make to his men was to be the contents of such a packing case supplied by Drum barns and Craigross. We wanted no inspiration to play our part in the women's offering, though we were pleased enough that each family of us should receive a pretty little note from Lady Caroline or one of the Miss Mowbrays, politely soliciting our aid. If the Drumbarns family had shown themselves supine, we should have found some other outlet for our itching fingers and glittering knitting needles. What cravats, comforters, chest-preservers we accom plished ! What bales on bales of stockings, muffatees woollen gloves and doddy mittens, we turned out with wonderful celerity ! One is tempted to ask were all the wool came from in such a hurry, and how much was left in the country when the call for it was at an end ? Following the instinct of our Scotch foresight and thrift, we dealt largely in sober colours \u2014 chocolate brown and priest-grey, because these were fast colours, and did not easily soil. The work was not pretty work by any means. It was rough and coarse, and the heavy pins or needles, together with the texture of the wool, sometimes tried the slender soft fingers ; yet it is doubtful whether the most artistically designed daintiest silken embroidery ever afforded such unmixed satisfaction to the workers, or whether eager young faces, flushed with enthusiasm and glowing"], [111, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DA 1 99 with effort, ever appeared to greater advantage than in the circumstances. Knitting or crocheting was less depressing work than making lint and stitching together bandages which brought before us melancholy visions of sanguin ary battles with desperate wounds draining the life blood, and hideous amputations. In spite of all we had been told of a winter temperature far below zero, we could not think of our friends as otherwise than com forted and cosy with the fruit of our labours. We kept up our energy by setting ourselves tasks and figuratively \" running races \" with each other, em ploying hands instead of feet in the struggle. . To facilitate the last man\u0153uvre we used to assemble to gether in parties, thickly clustered round dinner-tables or tea-tables, hardly intermitting our voluntary toil to sup our soup and finish our dessert, or to nibble our bread and butter and bits of bun and shortbread and drink our tea or coffee. As to breaking off our engagements in order to play each her stock-piece on the piano, or to join in a game of bagatelle or back gammon, we should have been ashamed to propose such a thing ; we should have felt like deserters and renegades had we been guilty of it. Our solitary entertainment was that of hearing the war columns of Tlie Times read out to us. We could not in any other way acquire the information it was incumbent on us to master.

The clear treble voice boggled, though it was assisted, over the difficult foreign names, but gave without a falter in a high pitched cheerful sing-song, the most harrowing par ticulars. Sometimes one of our elders, an excited greybeard, or a horrified lady in a widow's cap was our reader. As soon as Archie Lumsden was able to leave his rooms and appear at the gatherings of his former school companions at the Moat he was the life of the company. His blanched face and shrunk figure were speaking illustrations of the dangers and privations he and his fellows had encountered which we were as sembled to do our small \" possible \" to lessen. Archie had many nice attributes. He never lost heart or faith in his chiefs. He never complained of the obligations of his profession. He enlightened our ignorance with regard to the earth-works, grape-shot, shells, and mortars, while he did not dwell on horrors. He was fonder of charming us with stories ofthe wild picturesque Zouaves \u2014 French importations from Algiers, carrying their cats as well as their kits on their shoulders. Though the little fellow, being little and"], [113, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DAY. 101 martial, had something of the strut of the game-cock, he never crowed even on his father's hearth. His own exploits, and he had distinguished himself on more than one occasion, and had earned his captaincy, were the last things he would have dreamt of mention ing. He was as modest as he was brave. We were all fond of our friend Archie. But Archie Lumsden did interfere with Hettie Nairnc's work. She would sit arrested as she hung opened-mouthed on his talcs. Then he would tease her on the little she had done, and she would do still less in exchanging nimble thrust and parry of tongue with him. Seeing this, some of us would get her to sing, for Hettie Nairnc's singing was an accomplish ment which even we recognised to be something out of the common. It was not that there was anything very remarkable in the culture, or compass, or timbre of her voice. It was the manner in which she rendered the plaintive old Scotch songs which constituted her repertoire. By what intuition did she sing thus ? She was a merry little girl, who had hardly known sorrow, yet to hear her give \" My Nannie's Awa',\" or \" Logan Braes,\" might have wiled a bird from a tree or a man's heart from his bosom by sheer artless pathos. It was no great matter that we should be deprived of Hettie's services in other respects, for at this date she was not, at her best, an expert knitter. Besides,"], [114, "WAR TIMES. 102 she was in Craigross for the express purpose of enter taining her cousin Archie. The fear was that we might be beguiled into joining in the sport and forgetting the serious object of meeting, though we set our faces against the lapse. Like kittens and colts, we could not help relieving ourselves by games in the intervals of our intense application. Perhaps, after all, we were most comical and mirth-provoking with that laughter which has the twinkle of wistful tears in the background, when we were most dead-in-earnest in our occupation, as if we, the girls of Craigross, were fit to clothe an army ! One might have fancied the quaint inexplicable song \u2014 We're a noddin', nid, nid, noddin' had been made to suit us. We were all nodding after a fashion, moving our hands and arms with a rhyth mical precision, bending our heads to count and cast off and on our stitches. To carry out the simile, we too knew of some people who would not nod with us, at least not publicly, and to the accompaniment of the reading out of The Times newspaper. But then it was totally foreign to the character of our most conspicuous defaulter to record of her \u2014 \" She sits in the corner Suppin' a' the broo.\" What were we like as we went in for our Herculean undertaking, forming busy groups in the firelight as in the gaslight, for the operation of knitting does not need"], [115, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DA Y. 103 much illumination, and we could not spare ourselves a blind man's holiday with all these shivering men waiting for our gifts. We were much like other girls in their blooming time. What did we wear ? Straight skirts over our modern hoops with little tucks and flounces, full bodices, sleeves reaching to the wrists, unless we were in full dress, linen or lace collars and cuffs turned down from our throats and up from our wrists, in a mode the reverse of the present ; dainty ribbon neck-ties passed under the collars and tied beneath the chin. The tying of these bows was an art, and they might have been a survival of \" the bonnie breast-knots.\" In cold weather we were proud to wear open jackets of cloth or velvet, named for our friends the Zouaves, and borrowed from those outlandish allies ; or we wore close jackets, knitted of soft deep-tinted wool and styled \" polka jackets,\" because they came in with the Polish dance. Our hair was uniformly parted in the centre above our smooth foreheads, sometimes it was braided behind the ears and coiled in plaits at the back of the head, as Maggie Lumsden and Aggie Colville wore their hair. Sometimes it was curled with the curls tucked up trimly and piquantly in a fashion we had learnt from the fair-haired Swedish singer. Here and there the hair was drawn high from the forehead at each side, and made to form loops by being worn over small cushions or\" puffs.\" The effect"], [116, "WAR TIMES. 104 was to produce a curious resemblance to the ears of a fox. Isabel Colville patronised this fashion, but her flaxen hair was not so much like a fox's ears as like the ears of a plausible purring cat. Nets were not yet discarded for grown-up girls, and they were still uni versally worn by school girls. We had been a good deal given to netting these versions of the old world \" cauls \" in chenille, or silk, or even gold or silver thread, before we transformed ourselves into army outfitters. When we walked out we wore modifica tions of the \" cottage bonnet \" in straw, or drawn silk, or velvet. We had always the fiction of \" caps \" be neath the bonnets, in the blonde bordering interspersed with knots or sprays of flowers, or bows of ribbon which framed our youthful faces. Round hats were hardly known among us. They existed for us chiefly in prints from Sir Joshua Reynold's and Gainsborough's pictures, and in the costume of Dolly Vardcn, as shown in the illustrations to \" Barnaby Rudge.\" That was the era of shawls in all the dignity of their three corners. To wear a shawl well was one of the crowning distinctions of an exceptionally well-made and naturally elegant woman. None of us could wear a shawl with the perfect simplicity and grace that had a dash of stateliness in it which marked the act when Aggie Colville was the wearer. But I am bound to confess that while Aggie's chest was broad her shoulders were sloping. I believe sloping shoulders"], [117, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DAY. 105 were wanted for the right wearing of shawls, and shawls went out when the liking for square shoulders, real or artificial, grew on the public. It is not difficult to conceive how a shawl must hang from high square shoulders, and their general accompaniment, a short neck. If we were \" guys \" in those days we we not aware of it, any more than you, my girl readers, have the slightest suspicion of how contemptuously your present dress will be regarded by your successor some forty years hence. It was certainly remarked as singular exceptions that neither Mrs. Hume nor Aggie Colville was ever present at these working parties. There was some reason for Mrs. Hume's absence. She was an elderly woman, and though older people sometimes joined us, such a compliment was not to be lightly expected from the mistress of the Saughs. Besides, from the date of her illness, three months before, she had to be careful of her health and to abstain from going out in the evening. On the other hand, she never invited us to meet at the Saughs, though she could have furnished us with her own copy of The Times. But surely Aggie Colville was not entitled to the privileges of age and infirmity? She might have occasionally replaced her elder sister, who, after Hettie Nairne, was the least efficient ofthe company. Isabel could make no progress, she was so occupied"], [118, "106 WAR TIMES. with asking people's advice as to when it was best for her to \" let out \" and \" take in,\" or whether it would not be advisable to give over \" ribbing \" when plain knit ting could be done so much more rapidly True, it would not cling or keep its place, but was not speed the most essential point? \u2014 at least so Miss Louisa Mowbray had written to Isabel, underlining the word speed. Isabel could not mind her own business for dictating to her neighbours on the great question cf \" purl and plain.\" Aggie was not without excuses for deserting us. Her father wanted her. A new teacher of arithmetic had come to the Academy, and he gave the boys and girls long sums to do at home which the scholars could not manage unless they were looked after. The same \" master \" made his pupils' lives a burden by dint of the tables of weights and measures, and of native and foreign coins, which he expected the children to commit to memory, and bear on their juvenile minds. This was all very well, but we felt affronted by Aggie's withdrawal from our ranks and her constant substitution of the never unwilling Isabel as Aggie's representative. We were not very sorry that Aggie should suffer in turn for forsaking us, and she did suffer, for as we knew, no more than these three copies of The Times came to Craigross, and we saw the current copy when it was but a day old, while."], [119, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OFTHE DAY. 107 it could not reach the Colvilles' cottage till it was twenty-four hours older. We need not have been so spiteful, for Aggie did not stint us of her aid, though she did not support us with her presence. Mrs. Hume, to do her justice, sent goodly sheaves of knitted articles. She made her staff \u2014 May, Lizbeth, and Babby \u2014 work to supplement the achievements of her stiffened fingers. Nay, it was whispered that Logan, who was almost as formal!)7 dignified as his mistress, had been pressed into the service, after it was discovered that he had been a herd in the days of his humble obscure youth, and had learned the usual accomplishments of a herd before he rose to cleaning plate and waiting table. Logan had consented to relinquish the exemption of his manhood and take up his wires again with the -women-folk, to shape his \" ankles \" and turn his \" heels \" according to old recollections, yet the bundles which Mrs. Hume could forward to us were not be compared to those Aggie Colville sent, the fruit of her single pair of hands. The girl must have knitted unremittingly all the time she sat with her father, all the time she taught her young sisters and brothers, and far into the cold silent night, when the fires were out, and the rest of the household were still and asleep.

As for Aggie, she was tempted in these lonely vigils to ask herself if this haunting face was not a sign sent to show that Wat Hume was beyond woman's care. Had he come back like poor \"Sandy\" in one of those songs of Hettie Nairnc's, which thrilled alike the unconscious singer and the better instructed listeners, to tell Aggie Colville, of all people, ever with the reproach lingering in the sad, steadfast eyes, that all was over, human toil would be henceforth wasted on him? Here was the same wan moonlight, if the \" Shores of Dee \" were absent. Why might not the shade of another generous \" Sandy\" appear with his version of the piteous tale ? \u2014 \" Three days we strove our bark to save, But all our striving was in vain.\" And his tender last words \u2014 \" Our struggle's past, and we're at rest, Sae, Mary, weep nae mair forme.\" There was no doubt that Aggie Colville, after the first two or three times that she went to enquire for Archie Lumsden, sedulously and determinedly avoided"], [121, "KNITTING, THE ORDER OF THE DAY. 109 her old acquaintances. She even gave up going to the Lumsdens on the same short plea which she had offered for renouncing our society \u2014 she was wanted at home. There was not a little animated discussion among upon the subject. It was so odd and inexplicable of Aggie, so inconsistent with her friendship for Maggie, and the frank and intimate manner in which she had been wont to go and come to and from the Moat which she never entered now. Maggie Lumsden was bewildered and distressed by this avoidance on Aggie Colville's part, but she said nothing. Captain Lumsden, hospitable by nature, attached to old habits and familiar faces, made a clamorous protest to start with, and then declared pettishly that he would not again ask such a fickle craft to cross his harbour bar. Airs. Lumsden cried out against girls' airs and whims, and proposed to meet them with the answering airs of a high and mighty little matron. Archie was startled and pained for one moment, and next hastily acquiesced in Aggie's evident intention of standing aloof from him and his family. He gave in the hurry of the moment a peculiar reason for his acquiescence. He said Aggie Colville was so honest and truthful that it was the most difficult thing in the world to avoid speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to her. It was next to impossible to equivocate or"], [122, "WAR TIMES. 110 act a part where she was concerned. He complained also that a look had come into her eyes \u2014 a wistful, questioning, desolate look \u2014 which made him feel wretched beyond his deserts. If Aggie was unhappy in herself, and had taken any step which she regretted, he was sorry, but he could not call himself to account as the person chiefly to blame. It is the tongues of ignorant, comparatively uncon cerned, outsiders which will wag most furiously on unaccountable alterations of conduct in their acquaint ances. There were two motives assigned for Aggie Colville's behaviour : one was that she, a modest girl who respected herself, had learnt the manner in which gossip had coupled her name with Archie Lumsden's before he went to the wars, that she had also stored up and brooded over, perhaps not too wisely, the slighting mention of her and her family by Mrs. Hume and Mrs. Lumsden, and that she was now tak ing \" the first word of flytin',\" according to the ancient proverb, and was scrupulously guarding herself from a repetition of the offence. She was showing to all concerned, including the great public, that she was not for Archie Lumsden or any other Craigross lad. The young men might \" go hang,\" or marry duke's daughters for what Aggie Colville cared. It was Aggie's friends and admirers who took this view of the case.

That they should have had the grounds to go upon, simply indicated that Aggie Colville had the failing common to men and women like her \u2014 namely, a tendency to be regardless, even oblivious, of appearances. Aggie's detractors averred that she stayed at home this winter because the real facts of the case were that she had been shockingly jilted by Archie Lumsden, in spite of her former fast friendship with his sister, and that she, Aggie Colville, was too proud and too much mortified to endure the sight of his violent flirtation with that pert, giggling little goose of an Edinburgh cousin of his, Hettie Nairne. Who would be the next victim of the lady-killer ?"], [124, "112 CHAPTER IX. THE YOUNG LAIRD'S WELCOME HOME \u2014 A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. The new year had come and gone; Archie Lumsden was jubilant over his rapid strides to recovery, with the prospect of his return to the Crimea. Neither father, nor mother, nor sister would hold him back. True, the old Captain's hair, from being grizzled, all at once became white as silver. Mrs. Lumsden's attacks of neuralgia grew so constant and so acute that Dr. Ewart, whom she was accustomed to call on ordinary occasions \" that bear of a man,\" who returned the compliment by pooh-poohing her chronic com plaints, grew positively serious and sympathetic towards this particular patient. As for Maggie, she never gave herself a moment's rest, she was always about some cheerful service to her neighbours. That was her plan for relieving her feelings. It was only \" the king's jester,\" Hettie Nairne, who, anticipating"], [125, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 113 the period when her occupation would be gone, had to put on a very firm expression of countenance and an air of having arrived at the years of gravity and discretion, to keep the tears back from her laughing eyes. It was then we heard that the young Laird had arrived at Portsmouth, and was coming down presently to Drumbarns. We had so far forgiven him that we were ready to welcome him home. After all, what had he done save unwillingly obey his father ? He had been present at the short, sharp encounter which delivered the Alma river and its heights into our hands. He had sought throughout the long-drawn-out hours of the blood-red day at Inkermann. He had lived for weeks and months amidst the smoke and lurid darkness, the boom, hiss, and rattle of a sky charged with the fiery showers of the greatest siege of modern times. He was no carpet knight after all. We were made ashamed of our resentment by Archie Lumsden's pleasure at the idea of hailing a war-comrade fresh from the Crimea, and by the manly good feeling and common sense with which he sought to impress on us the truth that the young Laird, for a delicate-looking chap, had done all he could, had discharged his duties like a man. It was in the fulfilment of a duty for which Archie heartily pitied him that Hugh Mowbray was quitting the scene of warfare in the thick of the conflict, and 1"], [126, "WAR TIMES. 114 preparing to settle down to the performance of what were, by comparison, the humdrum offices which fell to the lot of the heir apparent of Drumbarns under the trying supervision of the Laird. Our restored pride and satisfaction in our country man grew with its indulgence. We entered into the pleasant flutter of hope and expectation, which made Lady Caroline look ten years younger in her mourn ing for her younger son, and roused into something like a glow of youthfulness the usually rather re pressed and listless-looking Miss Mowbrays. But there was somebody even more blissfully up lifted than the Mowbrays. This was Katie Carruthers. By an arrangement with the authorities on the spot, Wull Coutts had got leave of absence to attend his master home. No doubt this was by special favour, for able-bodied men were at such a discount in the Crimea after the drain the war had inflicted, that premiums were held out to induce militiamen to exchange into the regular troops. But we were in a temper to condone the favouritism and to allow that the commanding officer knew best, while it was beyond question a great gain to Katie and to Tammy Coutts and his wife to have the chance of seeing Wull's face again, were it only for a few days. *The whole town was in a ferment. The reception which prudence had kept Craigross from according to Archie Lumsden was to be accorded without stint to"], [127, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 115 Hugh Mowbray. There was some talk of a demon stration on the part of the Laird's tenants, with a presentation, probably of an oil-painting of the young Laird in the uniform which he wore at Inkermann, to hang, as a memorial of the war and of one of its heroes, in the gallery at Drumbarns ; but that must necessarily be a work ofthe future. In the meantime the Militia band should play \" See the Conquering Hero Comes,\" drowning the rush of the approaching train with its inspiriting strains, and we should all be at the station to hear and see, to wave our handker chiefs and clap our hands as a feminine accompani ment to the masculine cheers. Peter Galloway and his staff should have something to do, for once in their lives, to hold in check the wedged-together crowd. At a further stage in the day's programme Hugh Mowbray would drive into the town in the Drumbarns carriage \u2014 open for the occasion, though it was the month of February, and February was filling the dyke according to custom. He would be accompanied by such gentlemen as he chose to have in his train, and would be bound for the Royal Arms Hotel to meet the provost and bailies and the principal gentle men in Craigross, who were to entertain him at a dinner given in his honour. It was our first opportu nity of showing publicly what we thought of our Crimean soldiers, and we were resolved not to let it slip. I 2"], [128, "116 WAR TIMES. There was some fear that Mr. Mowbray, with his inordinate notions of what was due to him, his jealous temper, and his wind-changing disposition, would prove restive and spoil our plans. But in the beginning he was so propitiated by having gained his end that to every proposal the town made he vouchsafed the blandest, most gracious assent. Archie Lumsden was the master of the ceremonies, and the chosen envoy between the town and Drum barns. He was here, there, and everywhere, risking his newly-regained strength in his exertions. It was an agreeable change from our knitting to help in the decorating of the town and station. The season did not admit of flowers, but we did our best with evergreens, which, when one came to think of it, were more appropriate as representing a hero's laurels. There was not a bay or a holly in the Craigross gardens which was not hacked recklessly, while our resources were supplemented lavishly by cartloads of shrubs from Drumbarns. When we had finished our work, long after it was dark the evening before the great day, and Archie Lumsden had mounted a ladder by the light of the gas lamps to affix to the main arch the scroll, \"Welcome Home to the Brave,\" we were charmed with the effect. We did not mind a threatening of snow ; we thought that would lend the last picturesque touch, with a reminis cence of Russia, to the scene."], [129, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 117 Who was it that talked that night of an old story \u2014 the welcome home of Gilbert, first Earl of Minto \u2014 the flower of his race \u2014 from his Governor-Generalship in India? How he and his loving wife had agreed the)' should meet in their own house, so dear to them both \u2014 the old House of Minto. How she and his people heard of his safe arrival in London, and pro ceeded to make their preparations with ample time for the joyous task, since a journey by posting from London was an affair of several days. How the arches of sweet roses were erected, the flags hung, and all was ready, when a messenger arrived with the woful tidings that the Earl had been attacked by a fatal illness on the road. He had surmounted the protracted exile, the heavy cares and responsibilities of his post, and the long sea voyage, to die on the familiar way between London and Minto, before he had looked again on the faces of his wife and children. We listened with bated breath, we spared a sigh for the old disaster, but we could see no parallel between Lady Minto's situation and our own. Yet within twelve hours we were destined to experience the same appalling uncertainty of human happiness when it is at its brightest, what we are tempted to call the irony of fate, in the grievous disparity between the anticipation and the reality. On the morning of the day when we were to have"], [130, "118 WAR TIMES. gone to meet and greet the young Laird, a servant from Drumbarns, sent by poor Lady Caroline, galloped into Craigross with the information that Mr. Mowbray had been summoned by telegram to London, for which he had already started. His son had burst a blood-vessel on the eve of setting out for Scotland, and was lying in his hotel in imminent danger of his life. We looked in each other's faces and read there the whole pathetic story. The family malady, which had stricken the younger brother at Drumbarns, had pursued the elder to the Crimea. There was a theory at the time, the correctness of which cannot be vouched for, that the state of the atmosphere in the course of a long siege bears a resemblance to what would be the result of a perpetual thunderstorm, in the well-nigh incessant reverberation of the air, and in the violent electrical disturbance. These conditions were supposed to be trying to the strongest chests. Be that as it may, the lung weakness was there in Hugh Mowbray's case ; the hard work, exposure, and constant excitement were more than enough to mature it. The poor young Laird had struggled manfully against disease, and fought with more desperate odds against him than any we had dreamt of. Wull Coutts had succeeded in getting his master as far as London when the ominous signal of hemorrhage"], [131, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 119 awoke the patient and all who were acquainted with the circumstances to what was likely to be the end. The young Laird did not die then. He rallied sufficiently to be brought home to Drumbarns. It was an instance of one whose \" death in battle was won, yet who died on his own home-pillow,\" in the room which had been his from his cherished boyhood. He even drove once into Craigross; and looked around him with eyes which had a far-away light in them, while the glances which we stole at him were full of tender, remorseful awe in place of gay congratula tions. We did not presume to offer him earthly laurels for whom the heavenly palms were waiting near at hand. We talked tremulously under our breath of what we heard of his unselfishness, his un complainingness, his unshaken faith and hope. We recounted all the old stories we could recall of how unassuming he had always been, how willing to be friendly. Our hearts were fit to break for his mother and sisters, who shut themselves up with him for the short time that remained to them. And who did not pity the broken-down father, all his ambitious dreams shattered in spite of his frantic efforts, walking with bowed head, the chief mourner, after the last male shoot from the parent tree, which should have carried on the main line of the old Mowbrays of Drumbarns ? That procession through the town to the family burying-ground in the church-"], [132, "WAR TIMES. 120 yard was fated to be the young Laird's public entrance into Craigross. It was, in a measure, a soldier's funeral, with the Militia representing the dead man's absent regiment, and the band playing \" The Dead March in Saul \" in place of \" See the Conquering Hero Comes.\" A conspicuous figure in the company was Archie Lumsden, looking almost as white and thin as when he first walked out after his return, yet before the end of April he was to be back in the Crimea, and we knew that nothing, neither family affection nor young love, only the finger of God, could detain him. We needed Mr. Fowler's sermon on the following Sunday \u2014 one of those funeral sermons so often heard in our Scotch churches, yet not often so entirely touching as this, in which the minister referred to the lad whom he had baptised and admitted to his Master's table, who was now far before him in heavenly knowledge and love. Then the preacher quoted Bishop Heber's hymn, which sounds like the blast of a trumpet \u2014 \" The Son of God goes forth to war, A kingly crown to gain : His blood-red banner streams afar ; Who follows in His train ? Who best can drink His cup of woe, Triumphant over pain, Who patient bears His cross below, He follows in His train ! \""], [133, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 121 Whoever has attended a soldier's funeral, conducted according to strict regulations, and waited to the end, must have been impressed by one observance omitted at Hugh Mowbray's funeral \u2014 the return of the fellow-soldiers after they have fired their three volleys over their comrade's grave, walking in quick step to the lively tune which has succeeded the solemn strains of the \" Dead March.\" It is as if to emphasise the conviction that the sunshine and shade, the flower and thorn which make up life ought to succeed each other with double rapidity in the experience of men who are under marching orders. They have not much time given them in which to mourn or to rejoice. They have to turn on their heels whether from joy or sorrow, brace themselves and advance courageously, if possible cheerfully, to meet the next event which is to befall them. We had a striking example of this versatility in the event of a marriage which took place at Craigross close upon this date. It is hardly to be doubted that funeral baked meats helped to furnish this wedding banquet. But what would you have ? Poor Hugh Mowbray would have been the last to object to it. It was a mercy that the recipients of the benefits were too matter-of-fact, too busy and burdened in their humble, hard-working poverty, too little troubled with sensitive scruples and disturbing associations to quarrel with any solid advantages honestly come"], [134, "WAR TIMES. 122 by.

It was but a poor version of wedlock, and the idea of Katie as a \"grass widow' had its grotesque aspect ; but if it would content Wull, Katie was prepared to make the compromise ; she was content to have her marriage shorn of its chief honours and dignities, with its rejoicings clouded and dimmed, which, considering that a woman is (or means to be) married but once in her life, implies a considerable sacrifice. She was willing to be a wife, yet no wife ; to stay behind with her mother while Wull roamed the world, to spend care-ridden and forlorn days, which might end too probably in prema- ture widowhood. This was Katie's act of womanly devotion and renunciation. We all thought Wull \u2014 bronzed and weather-beaten as he was \u2014 vastly improved. He had been honestly attached to Hugh Mowbray, and his master's death, which had helped to sober Wull, was not compensated to him by certain gains which had accrued from it.

The Mowbrays would not lose sight of Wull, which was a feather in his cap and a substantial gain to him in Craigross; and if the consciousness of well-earned respect and gratitude did not make up to him for the fresh grave in the churchyard, the sights he had seen, the scenes he had passed through, had further quieted Wull and toned him down, as it were. It is the cus tom to represent the most daring and dauntless of soldiers as the most incorrigible of gasconaders ; but we had not that impression in Craigross, and Katie herself had firmer faith in Wull's exploits the less he said about them. We were, every one of us, bent on doing honour to the first marriage of a Crimean soldier which came within our ken ; our energies, which had been subdued and drooping of late, sprouted forth and blossomed anew. We had little time for our machinations, but we made the best of the fleeting moments. We not only contributed the most wonderful articles to Katie's trousseau, we positively refurnished the living-ioom behind her mother's shop with candlesticks, flat-irons, looking-glasses, tea-caddies, China jugs, etc., etc. We made Katie's precarious embarkation in matrimony resemble the \" penny weddings \" of the previous een-"], [136, "WAR TIMES. 124 i tury, so improvised, multifarious, and motley were our gifts. We certainly helped to reconcile Mrs. Carruthers to the marriage, under the circumstances. \" Eh! to think my Katie should tak' the shullin' and follow the drum \" (which was exactly what poor Katie was not permitted to do), her mother had begun to lament dolefully ; but before we had done offering our pre- sents she did not require Aggie Colville's indignant remonstrance to bring before her the other side of the shield. Aggie had known the wife of a \" single sol- dier \" who had accompanied her husband to India, and had shown herself so capable a woman in all re- spects by washing, dressing and sewing for the officers' wives nursing them in sickness, teaching the soldiers' children, etc., etc., that though her husband never rose to be a corporal or sergeant, as Wull was almost cer- tain to rise, and the notable woman was the mother of a family, she contrived to lay by so much money that, when her husband got his discharge, they could hire and furnish a good house in a sea-bathing town. There the heroine let lodgings with such credit and \u25a0success that she educated her children and established them creditably in the world. Finally, she herself attained the dignity of wearing a lace cap and a silk gown in the afternoons, and of taking strolls for the benefit of her health. \"Do you mean to say, Mrs. Carruthers,\" demanded Aggie, with stern logic, \"that if Katie is willing to do"], [137, "A DEATH AND A MARRIAGE. 125 well in the shop here, she cannot do well in barracks anywhere ? I think she ought to be happy and proud to work with her husband.\" When it was known in Craigross that Mrs. Mow bray had sent the gift of a ten-pound note to Wull, and that the Drumbarns ladies had ordered a mahogany chest of drawers for Katie, Tammy Coutts and his family were sufficiently struck by the general support afforded to the couple to \" come round,\" make overtures to the bride and her kindred in the person of Mrs. Carruthers, and consent to be present at the ceremony. There were more distinguished guests in the little room behind \"the laigh shop\" in which, as a matter of course, Mr. Fowler tied the knot. For although Episcopalian weddings were occasionally held in \" the English Chapel\" in the town, no mar riage had been celebrated in the parish church for long generations. The connections of the two fami lies of Coutts and Carruthers, a crony or two of Wull's bachelor days rendered spruce for the occasion, a sprinkling of Katie's girl friends in their best bridal finery, made their way gingerly through the bags of flour and barley and the sacks of oatmeal behind the counter. Other guests traversed the same narrow passage. The \" best man \" and the \" best maid,\" who were Captain Archie Lumsden, bent on paying a compliment to a Crimean comrade, and his sister, equally willing to grace the marriage of a Craigross"], [138, "WAR TIMES. 126 girl to a soldier husband, entered the assembly by the same white and dusty way. They brought with them their cousin, the pretty young lady from Edinburgh that she might see a soldier's marriage. Archie and Maggie pulled off the gloves of the bashful pair, and when the deed was done, and the loaded tea-table came into prominence, Hettie Nairne, eager to be of use in her turn, helped everybody within reach of her arm to the \" stacks \" of buttered toast and cakes of shortbread. Had the times been different, another duty might have devolved on Archie \u2014 that of\" lifting \" the bride for the first reel ; but Wull Coutts, who with Maggie Lumsden for his partner should have formed the other couple in the foursome reel, had vowed with energy before the play began that not a foot would he stir in the Highland fling, or see another stir if he could help it, though it was his marriage night, be cause of as good a master as ever man had, the young Laird, laid to his rest in the shadow of the old church yonder."], [139, "127 CHAPTER X. MRS.

The listener was the conscience-stricken May, in her afternoon net cap instead of her morning mutch, and for her brat an extensive black merino apron. She was taken aback when she was thus late in the clay called to account for the liberty she had taken. The guilty woman hesitated unmistakably, though she was in no fear of any serious injury to her mistress's health likely to be inflicted by the information she could impart. Mrs. Hume had long ago recovered from the effects of her violent illness. She looked stronger than ever, in her well-fleshed size and her"], [140, "128 WAR TIMES. healthy pallor. She had every prospect of presiding over the Saughs for many a day. \" Weel, mem,\" said May after a pause, \" it was just a neebour lass that ca'd in and lent us a hand in our trouble.

I would not have demeaned mysel' and her by hinting it.

He obeyed his aunt's summons as soon as he received it, and ran lightly up the Saughs stairs with every appearance of having no cause to dread the meeting. \"Well, Auntie Hume, what's in the wind to-day?\" he cried, as he entered the drawing-room like the privileged kinsman he was. \" Is it your bank business you wish me to attend to, or am I to call to order that formidable gentleman, Ritchie?\" naming the tax collector. \" Neither the one nor the other, Archie,\" said Mrs."], [143, "A CASE OF CONSCIENCE. 131 Hume, without relaxing into a smile. \" You're too quick for anything.

You'll miss me every hour of the twelve, and be counting the days till I come back.\" \" I've had to do without other company which, though it might not be of any greater worth, was of necessity more to me than yours could be,\" said Mrs. Hume with great stiffness and formality, and he was aware that he had made a blunder. He sought to amend it by asking directly what she wished to hear from him. As he spoke he proceeded to disarrange the contents of the little shelf of her work-table which stood between them, and the first object he touched was a dog-whistle, which he recognised as belonging to his cousin Wat. \" Let that alone, sir.

I told him what I had heard, and spoke my mind that"], [146, "WAR TIMES. 134 you were doing very poorly for yourself, and that your father and mother had a right to be displeased and to try what they could to counter you. He flew up at that, and talked some nonsense about Aggie Colville's being a match for the best man in the land \u2014 on whom she would confer honour instead of receiving it from him. Then he was mad enough to hint that I had wrecked his life ; and after that he flung out of the house, as he well might, and I've never seen his face from that day to this, nor have I spoken of his way going to a living soul save you, Archie.\" Archie Lumsden sat silent, twirling the tassel ofthe bag of the work-table without a word of rebuke from its mistress. \" I see I must put it plainly to you again,\" Mrs. Hume began once more. \" Have you, or have you not, set eyes on Wat at any time of late ? \" \" Not very lately,\" said Archie, preparing to make a clean breast of it ; \" but I met him frequently at Balaclava.

We are brother men, standing shoulder to shoulder in the Queen and the country's cause. We lend each other a hand as long as we may, and when one is down and we can do no more for him, another takes his place.

He would scorn to be bought off under such con ditions.\" \" Do you intend to tell me that my son is to remain in the ranks whether I will or no ? \" stormed Mrs. Hume, in great disturbance at the outrageous nature of the proceedings. \"Whose fault was it if it is so?\" asked Archie candidly, in his deep sonorous voice. \" I cannot tell whether you can buy him a commission while he is in the ranks. I am not acquainted with any precedent of the kind. I should say not at once \u2014 not without lengthy negotiations, anyhow. But don't you see it would be infinitely better for him if he won his com mission ? He has got the stripes on his arm already. Look here, Aunt Hume, you and I have been good friends, you've always been kind to me, and I should be very sorry if we parted anything save friends, see ing it is a near chance if we ever meet again.

He is not far wrong now, what ever he may have been before.\" The first thing Archie did when he came back from his drive to Drumbarns was to call on the Colvilles, and manage to exchange a few words aside with Aggie while he was admiring her hyacinths. \" It was awfully good of you, Aggie, to go up to the Saughs when my aunt was lying ill with the cholera.\" \" Who told you that ? \" she asked sharply, glancing up at him with the scarlet blood mantling her pale cheeks. Then she sought to speak'evasivcly ; \" Sup posing there was any truth in the story, it would only have been an act of common humanity.\" \" The old lady told me herself,\" said Archie quietly. \" Oh ! does she know ? How did she find out ? \" said Aggie stopping short as she saw she had betrayed herself. \" I know somebody who would think all the world of it, how would count it a good deal more than an act"], [150, "138 WAR TIMES. of common humanity,\" stammered Archie, for it was not easy to force Aggie Colville's confidence, or to go against her evident desire. \" Archie,\" cried Aggie in passionate prohibition, \" you will not dare say a word of this to him, when I ask you not to do it ? \" She at once defied Archie, and put him on his honour ; thus his mouth was closed. The conversation stopped there, but it led to another conversation between Archie and his sister, when they were lighting their bedroom candles, and turning off the gas in the hall before retiring for the night. \" I say, Maggie, I want to ask your opinion on a question which I cannot answer for myself.\" \" Very well, my dear boy, I'll do my best to help you.\" \" Ahem ! it refers to two people in whom both you and I take an interest. Better mention no names. I did them some harm, unwittingly, you will believe me, a little time ago, and I'd be glad to set things right, particularly at a time when I'm bound to clear all scores.\" Maggie winced at his words, half-jesting as they were. He saw it and hastened to add \u2014 \" WVre all in good hands, and you may dance at my wedding yet, Maggie.

All the summer of 1855 the war with its great object \u2014 the capture and dismantlement of Sevastopol \u2014 dragged out its slow course, and seemed no nearer a termination. We were sick with hope deferred. What were the time of apple-blossom, the time of roses, \" the broomy braes of June,\" \" the fields white unto the harvest,\" which we had been wont to enjoy in turn, when our men, though they had ceased for the time to be subjected to the rigours ofthe Crimean climate in January, February, and March, were still maintaining the tremendous struggle against huge odds, for the resources ofthe great empire of Russia were proving all but inexhaustible !

The Emperor Nicholas, the prime mover in the political movements which led to the war, had been called upon to lay down an autocrat's crown and go where all men are equal. We were not so ignoble as to rejoice with the baser Turks at the death, by God's hand, of our deadly enemy, but we heard of it in significant silence. At last, in a year (by the month) from the time of the allied armies sailing in high hope of speed)' vic tory for Varna, in the September of 1S55, when the harvest moon was shining down on the golden sheaves in our fields, when the ruddy apples and russet pears were ripening in our Craigross gardens, the great news reached us that Sevastopol was taken, and we looked doubtingly in each other's faces in the excitement and incredulity of our joy. The com bined attack, so long planned, so often deferred, had"], [154, "WAR TIMES. 142 been made successfully. The French had taken the Malakhoff by assault. The English, after a hard day's fighting for the Redan, had returned to the charge at daybreak, to find the works, which had been held so doggedly, abandoned, and not a man left to stay the invaders' progress. Our hero for the hour was the gallant English lad who first scaled the outwork and won for himself the distinguishing title of \" Redan Massey,\" in ancient style, a cabinet edition of the Scipios \u2014 Africanus and Asiaticus. After the bone of contention was given up the con tending parties were only too willing to make peace, and then our troubles were ended. Our sole remain ing business was to afford a befitting reception to the war-worn soldiers who had fought our battles. Many people in London still remember the entrance of the Guards on their return march to Windsor. We could not do things on such a grand scale, but we cheerfully did our best. Peter Galloway was again likely to have his hands full with the arrivals and departures and the congregating of company at the Loanhead Station. But there was one Craigross lad whose pleasure it was to return singly and quietly in plain clothes. If he was recognised at all under the alteration wrought in him by a year of life in a foreign climate, and in spite of the greatcoat buttoned up to his chin, and the cap pulled down over his ears\u2014 for the later autumn"], [155, "PEACE 143 had grown cold and storm)- \u2014 he certainly failed for the moment to be identified with the recent war and the home-coming soldiers. He tramped the road from the station, arriving in Craigross after the wet night had fallen. As he entered the gaslit, glistening streets, forsaken by all who had hearths to sit by, he hesitated for an instant, not as if he did not know every inch of the ground, but as if he could not quite make up his mind with regard to his destination, when the one turning led to the Moat and the other to the Saughs. The pause was only for a second. Let his mother receive him as she might, he had a conviction it was due to her that he should first report himself to her, that she should not be the last to hear of his return, and that from some other mouth than his own. Therefore he went on steadily, threw open the iron gate, which had not been locked for the night, entered between the stone pineapples and their guardian willows, and knocked at the door of the house which had been his home. The door was opened by Logan, whose sight was sailing. He stood for a moment, blinking and puzzled, since the arrival of a male visitor was not a common occurrence at the Saughs after it was dark. The figure stood silent before him for as long as he could have counted three, and then pushed past him without a word, whereupon Logan realised who it was in a flash, and lifted up his disengaged hand"], [156, "WAR TIMES. 144 with a gesture at once high!)7 dramatic and per fectly helpless. \" It's Maister Wat, as sure as I'm alive, wherever he may have sprung from !

She had not had the gas lit, but was musing or dozing in her arm-chair in the fire light. She heard an approaching step, and turning half round peered in the dim light at the intruder. She was not certain of his identity till she felt his hand laid on her shoulder, and heard his appeal, \" I say, mother ! \" Wat had fully intended to take his mother by sur prise, but he grew frightened at the effects of the shock, as she sat absolutely motionless for a moment. The next he knew she was all herself, when she met him with the wrathful question, \" How dared you go away as you did, Wat, without my authority ? \" There spake the imperious woman of old, but she had not passed through the events of the last twelve months without being sensibly affected by them.

He was so struck and moved by the reproach from the ordinary self-sufficing, self- restrained woman, that he answered, on the spur of the moment, \" I'm come back, and I'll not leave you again.\" But his heart sank as he spoke, for he had the promise of his commission, and he had not forgotten the old galling restrictions and tyrannies of his home. She made him ring the bell the next moment, when she electrified and at the same time relieved Logan by what sounded like an almost ostentatious series of injunctions for Wat's refreshment and comfort. \" You'll bid Lizbeth see that the young master's room is put in order. No ; on second thoughts, it struck me as a trifle damp the last time I was in it ; you'll tell her to prepare the best bedroom, and light the fire that is laid, for the nights are getting cold.\" \" Don't put yourself to so much trouble for me, mother,\" interposed Wat hastily. \" You know I've been knocking about for the last year ; I have been rather more accustomed to roughing it than to being coddled.

Wat, while freeing himself from his great-coat, was vividly reminded of the fatted calf killed for the prodigal son. \" And who made me a prodigal ? \" he asked himself with lingering resentment. But he, too, had got his lesson. He had grown not one, but half a dozen years in manliness \u2014 in advance of the hot headed, impulsive lad he had been twelve months ago. He had learnt forbearance among his other tasks. He was touched to the quick by his mother's unconditional reception of him. She might not have really aged, she might be as strong as when he had seen her last, but the interval of absence enabled him to realise, as he had not realised previously, that she was a woman up in years, a widow, and but for him without a chick or child. He was bound to bear with her, to do his very best for her, at whatever price. If he did not, who would? It was a coincidence that the very first words which his mother spoke when she resumed her seat opposite to him related to his and her future, and were words of consideration for his manliness and concession to it. \" Wat, I have made up my mind,\" she said abruptly, and yet with her wellnigh majestic cere-"], [159, "PEACE. 147 moniousncss of manner, \" if you are agreed to stay at home, I'll make over to you the farm and the house at Sandy Knowe, as you wished when we last talked about it.

I think it is right to tell you at once, so that if you are of the same opinion as you were some little time ago, the thing may be regarded as good as settled, and be off our minds.\" \" Mother, you are too kind,\" said Wat, gratefully, while his face brightened inexpressibly. \" I feel that I have not deserved this at your hands, though I was doing my best to make up for having grieved you, and to be a credit to you in the long run.\" \" Say no more,\" said Mrs. Hume, with an oracular wave of her hand, and the subject dropped. After supper, Mrs. Hume led the family worship, as she had ahvays led it, without respect to Wat or to the fact that he had grown up to be the head of the family. Then when her son detected the quaver in her voice as she returned thanks to God for His mercies vouchsafed to her that day, his heart smote him anew with tender compunction, and braced itself up with firmer determination to strive harder to understand his mother, and please her. L 2"], [160, "148 WAR TIMES. \" So your cousin Archie was acting the part of commander, and you that of servant in the war?\" Mrs. Hume suddenly burst out, as soon as she had put to Wat a few of the innumerable questions which beset the returned soldiers in relation to these familiar words, the Crimea and Sevastopol. \" That was something like it,\" replied Wat calmly ; \" but if we both did our duty to the best of our abilities, what then ? Old Archie is an excellent officer, and he is coming back a major.\" \" Yes, I have heard enough about that,\" Mrs. Hume interrupted her son in an aggrieved tone. \" Why, mother, I thought Archie was a favourite of yours ? \" protested Wat good-humouredly. I am sure nobody need grudge him his promotion, it was well earned. But he and the other officers could have done little if they had not been seconded by their men, I can say so much, and if only that commission had come in time, I might have shown you and other people that I, too, had not done amiss for a Craigross loon. But Archie had all the luck which was going. I don't say for a moment that he has not merited the luck better than I have, I don't mean to complain, but there it is,\" ended Wat with a quick sigh. His mother had not been following him closely ; she replied to the first of his remarks : \" I have no fault to find with Archie Lumsden, and I suppose you're right about the men All the same I should"], [161, "PEACE. 149 like to see you upsides with your cousin \u2014 there is no harm in that, and perhaps I may yet, in some things.\" Wat was more chary in enquiries after the towns people than might have been looked for from a loyal fellow after so much as a year's absence. It seemed as if he shrank from the mention of certain names. His mother gave him the news of the town un asked. \" Your cousin Archie is expected to arrive the day after to-morrow. It appears that a man of such consequence has to travel with deliberation and state. The provost and bailies have been putting off the town's banquet to celebrate the fall of the fortress and the Peace till so distinguished a gentleman as Archie should cast up to make a speech. My nephew is ' sma' booket ' for so great a warrior,\" added Mrs. Hume, still with a touch of irony, and an approving glance at her son's six feet of stature ; \" while, according to your words, he could have done little without the soldiers under him.\" \" Come now,\" remonstrated Wat, laughing, \"Buona parte, Admiral Blake, and Alexander the Great were all 'sma' booket,' as you call it ; as for soldiers, if they are without leaders, they are like sheep without a shepherd.\" \" Archie's father \u2014 that stout, rampagious uncle of yours,\" continued Mrs. Hume, as if Captain Thomas Lumsden was no relative of hers, \" is making a pretty stir, as if it were the Great Duke of Marlborough"], [162, "WAR TIMES. 150 himself who was coming to the town. I wonder he can be so foolish. I wonder my silly sister-in-law and Maggie, who has some sense for a girl, don't try to hold him back from making laughingstocks of himself and Archie. There will be a grand explosion one of these days, and a different tale to tell soon. How much infatuation would you give an old man credit for? If you will believe me, your Uncle Lumsden has brought over that giggling thing \u2014 that Edin burgh niece of madam's, Hettie Nairne \u2014 to help to keep Archie's home-coming, as she was sent for to divert him when he was lying sick of his wound, and might have had more in his head. Did you ever hear of such blindness, unless he really wants a pretty goose of a penniless kinswoman for Archie's wife ? \" \" Archie will have a word to say in the matter, won't he ? \" suggested Wat in constrained tones. \" Oh, what can you expect from a young man like Archie?\" demanded Mrs. Hume sardonically. \"If you piped to him it was but natural that he should dance. The lassie Nairne's father has never got on at the bar. I've been told she has three or four long legged brothers who are no good \u2014 not even to stand and be shot at like your wise self, Wat, my man.

I thought old Archie had better \" He pulled him self up and substituted for what had been on the tip of his tongue a praiseworthy attempt at a liberal opinion. \" I have only seen Hetty Nairne once or twice, years ago, before she was quite grown up. She promised to be a pretty, lively, little girl, and I remember she sang like a Untie. I daresay he is to be congratulated. His family, who think so much of him, justly, will come round in time.\" \" They have made the bed they must lie upon,\" said Mrs. Hume sententiously. Then she thought fit to impart a totally different, and as it sounded, irrelevant piece of information. \"Wat, do you know Miss Aggie Colville came up and helped to nurse me when I was in the agonies of the cholera ? \""], [164, "WAR TIMES. 152 \" What ! \" shouted Wat, jumping up open-mouthed. \" She did that ! \" Mrs. Hume repeated her assertion with still more vigour. \" I was told afterwards it was for love and not for money ; yet I'm fain to confess I had been under the impression that there was little love lost between her and me. Now, sir, can you enlighten me? You should be able to do it, if anybody can. Was it for love of me or of you, or simply for love of the God that made us, that she came where few ventured ? \" \" Ask your own heart, mother, was it not for love of all the three?\" answered Wat, in a voice low with emotion, and having more of awe than of triumph in its tones."], [165, "153 CHAPTER XII. AN OLIVE BRANCH AND A LAUREL BOUGH. The next morning early Wat Hume was out and about \" the doors \" of the Saughs, and had gone in the direction of the ivy-covered, tumble-down wall which divided the Humes' washing-green from the wilderness at the top of the Colvilles' garden. The rain of the last night had passed away for the present, and left in its place the crisp, cool sunshine of an autumn morning. There were silver)- gossamers on the clustering ivy and the bushes beyond. In the distance he could, from the slight elevation of the ground, look down between the plots of yellowing, shrivelling gooseberry bushes, which he knew to be the happy hunting-ground of the younger members of the Colville family throughout the summer. He could see beyond the bare pea-sticks and the half empty potato ground and wealth of cabbages. He could catch a glimpse of Aggie's flower-beds. There"], [166, "154 WAR TIMES. were the purple and white dahlias, the pink and straw-coloured hollyhocks, still untouched by the first frosts. There were the last lingering roses, with a faint, fugitive fragrance for the most part: The delicate blushes of their youthful prime were blanched by the increasing ruin, which lent also a bluish tint to their deepest crimson. A single touch sent the petals falling in showers to the ground. There were the straggling nasturtiums, brilliant still in every shade of brown and gold, though the flowers were dangling at the end of bare stalks, from which the thick, mantling, round leaves, after changing from green to yellow, curling up and growing grey at their edges, had dropped in turn. The mellow ripeness and mild languor of decay here and there lit up with a poetic touch, and the pensive grace of autumn, were over everything. Wat knew that garden at all seasons. He had listened to the distant note of the first cuckoo in the fields beyond. He had \" shied \" stones at the black birds when they were making the strawberries and rasps scarce. (Now it was a robin which was trilling its song from an apple-tree.) The watcher from the other side of the wall was acquainted with every inch of the ground. Had he not played ball with the elder girls by the hour within its bounds? If he had not skipped over a rope on his own account, he had held it for Aggie and Isabel to skip over. How agile"], [167, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 155 Aggie had been ! What a lame performance Isabel's was by comparison ! At a later period he had made hutches for Alick Colville's rabbits, and knocked up a pigeon-house for Johnnie's pigeons. He had given Aggie an afternoon's spade-husbandry among the vegetables, when she was raking among her flowers. He had for years and years climbed the great walnut tree in order to shake down the walnuts, which were never, within his recollection, ripe enough for any thing save pickling. He and Aggie had sat on that garden-seat when he taught her the schoolboy version of the art of making flies for fishing, and she had repaid him by showing him three very diminutive trout in her basket, and proudly assuring him that a dish of freshly-caught trout was not to be despised for breakfast or supper. How often Wat had shut his eyes for a second \u2014 when he was far away from Craigross, trudging along, all but beaten, amidst the dead bullocks and over turned waggons, the slush and snow as foul as the slush of that terrible road between the harbour and the camp in the Crimea \u2014 and had seen this familiar garden. Still more frequently did he see it when he was lying sleepless on his hard bed, with the stars looking in through a rent in the tent-covering, and he kept asking himself, would he ever see Craigross again ? Wat was aware that the news of his arrival the"], [168, "WAR TIMES. 156 night before at the Saughs could not yet have become common property in the town, or even travelled so short a distance as that to the Gable Cottage. But supposing it had been otherwise, he told himself, it could not have been with the expectation of meeting anybody in particular that his feet took him to the boundary between the two properties \u2014 the barrier which had been no barrier to him. It was merely the yearning to see again his former resort, and remind himself of the associations connected with the land marks. It was over this lower bit of the wall he and Aggie Colville had leant, with a French grammar between them, while they were puzzling out the right reading of a difficult exercise. It was in that hole he had dropped Isabel's pencil-holder. He had fished it out again, but it had been, according to her view of the matter, so scratched and spoilt that she was not pacified till Aggie exchanged with her, taking the scratched pencil-holder and giving Isabel hers instead. Wat began to speculate if he should ever leap across that wall again. He did not guess, in spite of what he knew, that Aggie Colville had climbed it desperately on a day of tumult and distress last September. All at once he saw Aggie herself coming up the garden-path. She was not there to greet him. For anything that she knew, he was many miles away."], [169, "OIIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH 157 She did not sec him even now. She was occupied with protecting her skirts from the recent rain which had drenched the box-edging. She was glancing low from side to side to ascertain nothing of more importance than whether any apples or pears had fallen during the night. It was Aggie, unchanged in every detail, in her plain neat house frock, with its white collar and cuffs, and in the little black silk apron which every girl wore then. She had nothing on her head, because she was too hard)' to shrink from any cold which could be experienced on a fine morning in September, and the sun, veiled by the autumn haze, was no longer high enough in the sky to dazzle or scorch her. That speculation as to whether Wat Hume would ever again take French leave to vault the dividing wall was settled on the instant, \u2014 without another thought he was at her side. \" Aggie ! \" \" Wat ! \" She might have had a dream of him coming back in this way among sadder visions, still she must have been very much startled and taken aback by his sudden appearance. But so far from screaming and fainting in his arms, she behaved with the utmost womanly dignity and self-control. She was glad to see that he had returned, she told him. She asked where he had come from, and how long he had been"], [170, "158 WAR TIMES. at home? She hoped his mother was well. It was just as if he had been spending the last twelve months in Edinburgh at college. It was not Aggie who was a trifle put out and vexed. It was Wat, who would have preferred that she had not been so capable of controlling herself. He might have comprehended that Aggie Colville was the last girl in the world to be so occupied with herself and her feelings as to be overwhelmed by them, and compelled to treat him to a scene. The two walked together for a few minutes, un heeding earth or sky, the exquisite variety of tints with which the feathery carrot leaves were fading, the deep red of the beet, the curly green leaves of the \" savoys.\" A pair of speakers were talking vaguely and sedately of the peace and the war, and the Craigross men who had been engaged in it. Both knew what was coming. Aggie was nerving herself for it. It was Wat who, as having to take the initia tive, was the most agitated. \" Aggie, how can I ever thank you for what you did for my mother ? \" he broke out presently. \" It was only common humanity,\" she protested, turning aside her head. But she was too truthful a woman to keep up the pretence. She was as con scious as he could be that though there might have been common humanity in the deed there was some thing else at its foundation. \" Say no more about it,"], [171, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 159 if you will please me, Wat,\" she begged, clasping her hands involuntarily. He looked hard at her. \"A year is a long time,\" he began again wistfully. \" If I was a hot-headed fool, in more respects than one, I have had to pay the penalty. I have been trying to make amends, and my mother has accepted the atonement, such as it is. She is going to let me 'have the Sandy Knowe lands and house, where I can work for myself and be master of my life but it will be little worth if you are not going to forget and forgive after what I have suffered.\" \" Do you think we have not suffered too ? \" she told him half under her breath, still nervously clasping and unclasping her hands. \" That is all the more reason why we should be friends,\" he urged eagerly. \"Will you not be friends with me, Aggie ? \" he pleaded as he might have done when they were boy and girl, employing the same language with another meaning, and signifying, as each understood perfectly, that something different from friendship was wanted. \" If you only knew how often I feared I should never see your dear face again,\" resumed Wat. \"Say no more, Wat,\" she repeated in a whisper, with her head still turned away that he might not see how her lips were quivering; but the tone had altered, he knew she had surrendered, and that silence meant consent."], [172, "160 WAR TIMES. Mrs. Hume did one positively fine thing. Her son had come back to Craigross in plain clothes, but she made him once again put on his sergeant's regimentals, when she took his arm and walked with him through the streets of the little town. She carried him to the Moat, where everybody was rejoiced to sec him. In the face of his mother's distinct announce ment, \"It was my wish that my son should show himself this once in the soldier's dress in which he sought his country's battles,\" not even little Mrs. Lumsden could raise a shrill demur. If Mrs. Hume was herself doing penance in per forming the action, the penance sat lightly upon her, for by the time she called at the Gable Cottage her face bore an expression of something more like pride than shame. Isabel Colville went to call Aggie from her room to help to entertain the visitors. \" It is the Humes, Aggie, mother and son. I wish you would come down. What brings them here? It is late in the day for her to call on us, and she's always so stiff and stately, by her way of it. We know Wat well enough, only I doubt whether he has any business to come here now, with or without his mother.\" \" Why not ? \" inquired Aggie quickly. \" Well, you know, it seems he went out to the Crimea with the rest, when we had, none of us, the most distant idea where he was. The Ferriers were"], [173, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 161 saying to-day that he will be invited to the town's banquet along with his cousin. A pretty story, con sidering how Wat Hume went away! To hear the Ferriers, one would have thought that he went as a volunteer. But I have been given to understand, haven't you ? that volunteers fought in black coats, whereas Wat Hume must have worn the common red coat of a simple soldier.\" \" Does the colour of the coat make such a dif ference, then, Isabel ? \" asked Aggie. \" It must,\" answered Isabel confidently; \" for, as we are all aware, a gentleman may be a volunteer, but no gentleman can be a simple soldier.\" \" Privates in the French army are sometimes gentlemen,\" objected Aggie ; \" and think how many poor Jacobite gentlemen were in the old Scotch regiment which served the kings of France to the death.\" \" That was long ago ; that was nothing with which we have to do. In place of quoting scraps of history or poetry I wish you would make haste and help me. There is only Lindsay with my father in the drawing room. But what do you think Mrs. Hume has gone and done? I think she must be a little daft. She has been parading the town with Wat dressed like a common sergeant. His clothes are not even new, they are all faded and stained. Did you ever hear anything like it ? \" M"], [174, "162 WAR TLMES. Whatever Aggie Colville might have heard, a light kindled in her dark eyes at the information which she received \u2014 a warm, sympathetic, grateful light which she could not put out of them when she and Mrs. Hume stood face to face. It said as plainly as looks could say, \"Ah ! this is really grand of Wat's mother. If I am ever to be her daughter she and I will not get on so badly together as I had feared.\" Nothing was said of what Aggie Colville had done during the cholera visitation. However certain it was that the story would leak out in course of time, for the present it was a secret, a bond of union between those principally concerned. All that Mrs. Hume said to Aggie was the formal, yet significant, speech when they shook hands at parting, \" I think you and I ought to be better acquainted.\" \" What did Mrs. Hume mean about you and her being better acquainted, Aggie, I should like to know ? \" Isabel buzzed unsuspiciously about the subject. \" I'm sorry for you, if she carries out the suggestion. She's a dreadful woman to get on with. As for Wat's manners, he may not have grown so rude and rough as one would have expected from his low-lifed prank, but he is certainly not improved. He was so taken up with himself, I suppose, that he hardly listened to a word that I said to him.\" As Mrs. Hume had predicted, there was a great scene at the Moat one fine morning several weeks"], [175, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 163 after Archie's return. It was uncertain whether he had coolly announced that he was not able to face the world without his entertainment being permanently provided for by what might be called \" a resident entertainer,\" or whether his hand had been forced, and he had been driven into an open declaration of his intentions by some worldly-wise recommendation that his attentions had better be bestowed in another quarter \u2014 an insinuation repugnant to Archie's honour able spirit and honest heart \u2014 the result had been the same. The old Captain was tramping up and down the house, well nigh black in the face, proclaiming, so that all might hear, that he did not know what young men were coming to, proposing to take the act of marriage into their own hands, and to set up establishments on their beggarly pay and nothing a year. Mrs. Lumsden was screaming out denunciations of the treachery of that little double-faced chit, Hettie Nairne. Archie was nearly beside himself to the extent of threatening that he would quit his father's house, and never enter it again, since poor little Hettie was to be held accountable for his fault. Moreover, she had turned, single-handed, on him and the whole house, with very proper self-respect and self-assertion, as the simplest creature will rebel against unbearable injustice. She had dried her pretty eyes, in a blaze m 2"], [176, "164 WAR TIMES. of girlish indignation and wrath. She was packing her modest mails in a fever to depart by that after noon's train, for good and all, from her uncle and aunt's house, to which she had been twice bidden expressly on Archie's behalf, where she was now in sulted on his account. Maggie Lumsden, in the character of universal peacemaker, was actually crying with pain and mor tification, as she appealed in vain to each of the con tending parties. Happily, however, Hettie \u2014 let her be ever so much insulted \u2014 could not set out for Edinburgh till the hour at which the afternoon train passed Loanhead. There was time for a little cooling down \u2014 for second thoughts. The remembrance stole back, with a thrill, to the hearts of both the Captain and Mrs. Lumsden, how Archie had looked much nearer death than mar- riage when he came back from the Crimea in the spring. There had been little prospect then of their having the chance of disapproving of his choice of a wrife ; they would have been tempted to snatch at the chance as the alternative of a fatal end to his illness. With the remembrance came a sense ofmany redeem- ing considerations. If Hettie Nairn had not a fortune to spend, neither had she been educated to spend for tunes. She had been well brought up in other respects, and was well principled in her simplicity. She was the Lumsdens' kinswoman, acquainted with all their"], [177, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 165 ways, as much at home with them as they were with each other. She was not like a stranger who might enter the family, and trample on its most sacred tradi tions. She could fill the Captain's pipe and measure out Mrs. Lumsden's tonic almost as cleverly as Maggie could. Hettie would make a contented, affectionate wife to Archie. Indeed, till she had been exposed to the fire of his family's opposition, she had evidently been enchanted with the idea of marrying an officer, and cheerily facing with him all the trials and dis comforts involved in following a inarching regiment. She had, by the elder Lumsdens' doings, shared their anxieties and triumphs in connection with Archie ; it was, perhaps, only fair that she should claim her part in the young fellow whom she had helped to bring back from the grave's mouth. Hettie was not hard to propitiate. She was per suaded to put back her frocks and ribands into the drawers which had been allotted to them. She was induced to listen to Archie's fervent apologies, and his father and mother's half-shy overtures at recon ciliation. The sequel was that in less than a week the old Captain was humming in high glee \u2014 \" Mount and go, mount and make ye ready ; Mount and go, and be a soldier's leddy.\" He was roundly asserting, and fully believing what he said, that he could not interfere with his son's"], [178, "166 WAR TIMES. choice. Archie was well entitled to marry whom, where, and when he would. Archie's father was loudly boasting what a pretty young thing his in tended daughter-in-law was, and that to hear her sing \" Ye Banks an' Braes,\" or \" The Land o' the Leal,\" was warrant for any man, even for an old salt, laying his heart at her feet. As for her devotion to Archie \u2014 well, there were other young women who hung fire, and pulled down their colours at the mere word of sailing in strange waters, or facing the enemy in another campaign, but Archie's little wife would be ready to follow him, if she were allowed, to a new Black Hole of Calcutta, or to the North Pole in the next expedition in search of Sir John. The young woman who pulled down her colours was Katie Coutts. Wull would have been pleased to remain in the army, but Katie \u2014 to whom the very thought of even Piershill barracks was a terror \u2014 listened to the counsel of her own timidity and that of her widowed mother. Katie used her influence with Wull, and caused him, to Captain Lumsden's disgust, to accept the Laird's proposal to find him a post in connection with the local Militia, so that Katie could still dwell in her beloved Craigross near her mother- This post Wull filled with considerable credit, en livening its dulness by many a thrilling tale of the regular service. We have all heard of the unfailing turning up of a"], [179, "OLIVE BRANCH AND LAUREL BOUGH. 167 bad halfpenny, and so, according to his ill-used wife's prophecy, the reprobate Sand)- Wingate returned un hurt from the wars, where many better men had fallen. Bullet and bayonet, cholera and fever could not harm Sandy. Fortunately for Chirsty, since he was not less untamed than unhurt, his country still claimed him. In the meantime, various friends of Mrs. Wingate's agreed that if he lived to get his dis charge, and remained unreformed in his depravity and brutality, means would be taken to keep his victim out of his clutches. The course of years saw Aggie Hume a handsome, beautiful matron, a power for good in her energy and unselfishness, still a stay to her father's house, while she was the first of earthly blessings to her husband and his mother. The tragedy-queen air, which had distinguished her for a time, did not outlast the Crimean War. When we come to think of it, none of the Craigross contribution to the army in the Crimea was left be hind on any Russian battlefield, or in that graveyard at Scutari, which still arouses tender thoughts in many English hearts. Even the young Laird lay under the green turf, beneath a Scotch sky. THE END."], [180, ""], [181, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH"], [182, ""], [183, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH.' CHAPTER I. BESSIE OLIVER'S ARRIVAL AT CABUL. Bessie Oliver went out to her family and home in Afghanistan younger than most girls who have been educated in England. There were several reasons for this. The Olivers were not rich, and could not afford to keep several children in England. There were two younger girls waiting to be sent home for their education as soon as Bessie should return. In addition, Captain Oliver had a military post so far north that the climate was, speaking by comparison, temperate enough for his family to reside with him permanently, and his children to be reared under his roof. Bessie had to grow up with obliging rapidity and * For full details of Bessie Oliver's experience, see Lady Sale's Journal, and Kaye's \"History of the Afghan War.\""], [184, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 172 get through her accomplishments at an age when many languid Anglo-Indian girls were just beginning to acquire theirs. She was only turned fifteen, and looked rather younger \u2014 a plump, rosy little English girl, who had spent the last eight years much thought of and cared for by her grandfather and grandmother, a worthy old-fashioned country doctor and his wife, in a little out-of-the-way town in Dorsetshire. The old Olivers of Berry were full of anxiety when they went to Southampton and saw Bessie on board ship. They had to put her under the charge of a slight acquaintance of her mother, and leave her to cross the sea, land at Bombay, and travel up the country to Cabul. But Bessie did it, if not quite com fortably, quite safely. No forewarning of the strange adventures which were to befall her girlhood met her on her long journey. She was lonely, timid, and sad on parting with the dear old people and the dear old place which had been home to her for so many years ; but she grew brave and cheerful when she thought of her father and mother, her sisters, and the little brother whom she had never seen. Indeed, she had not seen any of her family or her real home for eight years, and that was such a wide space in Bessie's young life, broken off from the rest by the gulf of her voyage from India under the care of some other obliging acquaintance of the Oliver family, that she had a half-laughable, half-vexatious difficulty in re-"], [185, "BESSIE Oil VER'S ARRIVAL AT CABUL. 173 calling her father's brown, kind face, her mother's manner of wearing her hair, Clara's dimple and Susie's lisp \u2014 not to say the black servants and native soldiers, the cantonments, the place where the band played, the great bazaar where the shawls and jewels were sold, the hills, and the river. Bessie was horribly sea-sick, and then ravenously hungry. She was well enough seen to during the three months' voyage by her mother's acquaintance. The lady in acting as the girl's chaperon was doing to others as she would be done by ; she was remem bering the little daughters she had left behind her in England, who might have to come out as Bessie Oliver was doing, under the wing of a stray, trust worthy visitor of their mother's, conveniently making the voyage at that time. But Bessie had to come down some steps in social importance. It was one thing to be the first grand daughter and cherished pet where a pair of kindly grand-parents were concerned, and another to be launched on the world in the shape of a girl who did not look nearly old enough to have come out. She might have been no more than twelve in her plain serviceable travelling suit and school-girl-looking hat. She was simply carried along as a favour by a lady who had left her heart behind her with her little girls several years younger than Bessie. Mrs. Laycock was ill as well as sorry ; and she had, during her stay"], [186, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 174 in the East in warmer climates than that of Cabul, learnt habits of self indulgence and apathy which could only be broken through by a supreme effort. Happily Bessie had some sense for her years. No doubt she felt affronted by the captain of the ship's calling her \" little Miss Oliver \" \u2014 in spite of the fact that she had grown quite an inch during the last six months, and was really only half a head shorter than Mrs. Laycock \u2014 and she could not help being hurt and forlorn when she was occasionally forgotten for a whole afternoon at a time by everybody. But she took heart of grace, and did not make too much of her grievances. She knew the captain was kind when he called her to see the shoals of porpoises and the flying fish. Instead of hating Mrs. Laycock, or trying to tease her by renouncing her authority and disobey ing her requests, the girl was sorry for the woman, who spent most of her time over the contents of a box to be sent back to England the moment they landed. Bessie dressed two dolls and manufactured a black velvet mouse to be added to the stores of that box, and was rewarded by more than a formal kiss from the poor mother who had left her children behind her.

She got a letter with the news that a good opportunity, which could not be lost, had been found for sending down Clara and Susie and embarking them under proper guardianship, and that actually the sisters had passed each other on the road. Bessie would have plenty of time to dwell on her hazy recol lections of Clara's dimple and Susie's lisp before she had the opportunity of verifying them. Her own face fell and her tongue faltered in giving the information to Mrs. Laycock. Bessie would fain have had a glimpse of her former playfellows before they were as grown-up \u2014 nay, even more grown-up than herself ; for as they had been much later in going to grand papa and grandmamma, so Clara and Susie would probably have attained the mature ages of eighteen and seventeen, and the sisters would not recognise each other when the younger reappeared at Cabul. It was a blow ; the house she had known as a child would be far quieter and less homelike without Clara and Susie. But Bessie pulled herself together again. Her mother would have nobody now save her Bessie to help her with Dodo and the servants, to drive with her, to serve as another lady when Captain Oliver brought in his brother officers to tiffin, to be her mother's companion when her father was absent. Dodo would not have a single sister left to make his top curl, to build up his bricks, or play at elephants with him till she reached Cabul and filled the vacant place."], [188, "176 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. Alas ! another and a sorer sorrow awaited poor Bessie. In the meantime she endured the dimly remembered, breathless, burning heat, and the utter lassitude after all food had become distasteful, of travel even in a dak-gharree, or post waggon. The journey was across rice swamps and barren plains, through mountain gorges where the air was fresh again, and the laurestinus bushes and rhododendron trees reminded her of Berry shrubberies in early spring and summer, but where the savage rocks, the jagged crests of high hills, and the turbulent river were un-English in their very beauty. At one of the gates of the town, set in the middle of wheat-fields and orchard trees, and having the snowy peaks of the Hindoo Koosh within sight, Captain but not Mrs. Oliver met Bessie. The girl's heart leapt up with joy when she sound that she knew her father instantly. It was not out of keeping with her recollection of him as the shy and preoccupied, often worried and wearied, head of the house, that though he greeted her with the greatest affection, he had little to say to her, and rather avoided her after the first moment. There was a lady with Captain Oliver whom Bessie in her agitation might have mistaken for her mother, though the one woman had been tall, fair, and handsome, while the other was little, dark, and plain, had not Mrs. Laycock prevented the mistake. The"], [189, "BESSIE OLIVER'S ARRIVAL AT CABUL. 177 lady too was agitated \u2014 it might be with trouble of her own, since she wore a black gown. When Bessie came to notice it, her father wore a black band round his arm. If he did so in compliment to the lady's mourning, she must be an intimate friend of the family, though Bessie was not aware that she had ever heard Mrs. Constable's name before. In a little puzzle and tremor, she could scarcely tell why, which dashed the long-expected gladness of her arrival, Bessie glanced at the stranger. Her father had half-forgotten to introduce them at first, then he named the lady hastily and briefly. The next moment Mrs. Constable took Mrs. Laycock aside, and exchanged a few hurried words with her. List less as Mrs. Laycock was, she uttered an exclama tion as if she was startled and moved. The girl was about to part from her companion over leagues of land and sea. Bessie was to see Mrs. Laycock get into her palanquin and set out by her self, while the others drove to the Olivers' house. Mrs. Laycock was better at the end than in the beginning. She clasped Bessie in a close embrace, and there were tears in the woman's eyes when she said, \"God bless you, child. Come and see me when ever you can.\" After Mrs. Laycock was gone, before the remaining three started, it struck Bessie that Mrs. Constable beckoned to Captain Oliver, and appeared to urge N"], [190, "178 IN THE CANNONS MOUTH. him to do something. The girl caught a few winds of what was said, and it sounded like, \" Do tell her yourself. She will take it better from you than from anyone else, and you ought to say it at once.\" The result was that Captain Oliver came up by himself to Bessie, while Mrs. Constable lingered a step or two behind. \" My dear,\" said the brave soldier in nervous dis tress, \" I do not know how to tell you. Your poor dear mother \u2014 we have lost her, Bessie. She has not been spared to see you again ; she has gone to a better place before us.\" Bessie gasped wildly, and at that moment Captain Oliver, as if he could bear no more, lifted her into the carriage, handed in Mrs. Constable, and sprang up beside the driver. \"What is it? \" pleaded Bessie to the stranger. \"Oh, surely my mother is not \" \" Dead ! \" said Mrs. Constable, speaking the word the daughter could not speak, gently but firmly. \" Yes, my poor girl, your dear mother is dead. It is terribly hard upon you, just when you expected to meet her, coming after the wear and tear of such a long journey too. But you must do your best to bear up for your father's sake. Between his duties and his loss, and the little boy only four years of age, he is sorely put to it. These are not easy times for any of us. There are troubles gathering fer the English in Cabul."], [191, "BESSIE OLIVER'S ARRIVAL AT CABUL. 179 Your father says, could he have foreseen a month or two ago, he would not have let you come out at any price. But you would not have wished to stay in England when even Clara and Susie are gone, and he is left alone with the little boy. Ah ! your poor mother is well away from a world of care and trial.\" Mrs. Constable, though naturally more of an actor than a speaker, was fain to run on, uttering moral truisms, as the best way of getting over the painful moments. The instant she stopped speaking Bessie uttered her faint moaning protest. \" But my mother cannot be dead ; she said she was well in the letter I got at Bombay since I landed.\" \" Ah ! it does not take long to kill us here, even up in Afghanistan,\" said Mrs. Constable, not so much sadly as with a matter-of-fact briskness which sounded almost cheerful. \" Mrs. Oliver was not very strong, perhaps, but she was in her ordinary health till the beginning of last week. She stayed out too late one afternoon. You know the hot season is past, and it is getting chill towards nightfall. She caught cold, inflammation set in, and she was past hope in three days. Everything that could be tried was done, you may rest assured of that. I was with her at the last, and she slept away quite peacefully. No, my dear, there was no message for you, though she often men- N 2"], [192, "180 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. tioned your name, and spoke of your coming out \u2014 to which she had so long looked forward, poor soul ! in her delirium. For the fever ran so high that delirium began at an early stage, and she was saved the pang of knowing she was to leave you all. Yes, Bessie, as I said, you must bear up and do your best. Think of your father and the baby-boy your mother was so proud of. He is little better than a baby ; my Harry is only eighteen months younger. Your father and little brother have none but you to look to now.\" Mrs. Constable was kind-hearted, straightforward, and practical, rather than sentimental. In happier circumstances the effect of her company was like that of a bracing wind. Her idea of encountering a mis fortune was to make the best of a situation by doing your duty and saying no more about it. She ended by telling Bessie that she, Mrs. Constable, could not stay with the girl, since Joe \u2014 Major Constable \u2014 and the children \u2014 there were six young Constables \u2014 could not do without her any longer. She had already been some time away from them, helping to nurse Mrs. Oliver, and doing what she could for Captain Oliver till after the funeral. But now all the sad business was over, and she had to go home ; but she had brought over her eldest daughter, Lizzie, who was about the same age as Lizzie. Bessie would remain with her and be company for her in the mean time."], [193, "BESSIE OLIVER'S ARRIVAL AT CABUL. 1S1 In her dazed misery poor Bessie could not at first appreciate the comfort of having a strange young girl with her. But when she entered the house, dizzy and trembling, she did not recognise a single dusky face, whether of ayah or khitmudgar, under muslin veil or cotton turban. Her father was called away. Her little fair-haired brother, trotting here and there, un conscious of his loss, knew Lizzie Constable perfectly well, and was on frankly familiar terms with her, but he cried and ran and hid his face \u2014 naturally enough \u2014 at every nervous advance from tear-stained, travel worn Bessie, as at an unknown intruder whose longing to make his acquaintance and friendly feelings to wards him he could not possibly guess. Then Bessie began to find it was something to have another white faced, English-speaking girl beside her \u2014 one who wore a black frock for Bessie's mother, was sorry for her, and could pacify Dodo. Fortunately Lizzie was in the beginning as shy as Bessie, so that it dawned upon the new-comer in the midst of her grief that it must be an ordeal for this other girl, still happy in the possession of a mother, to leave her own cheerful home and stay in a house on which death's dark shadow had just fallen. There was nothing to recompense her for the sacrifice, un less to be of a little use to Bessie in her wretchedness. With that thought she accepted gratefully the cup of tea which Lizzie, a complete young housekeeper, had"], [194, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 182 provided for the traveller, and tried to swallow it. As Bessie did so she looked wistfully in the other girl's face. She felt as if she ought to beg Lizzie's pardon for the pain and trouble she was inflicting on her. At the look Lizzie drew nearer, stammered, \"I am very sorry,\" and began to cry in her turn. The girls were friends from that hour."], [195, "rS3 CHAPTER II. BESSIE AND LIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES IN THE EAST. AFTER the first shock and the sorrow of being forced to give up what was in reality more of a happy, affec tionate dream than a blessed fact grasped all her life Bessie found the greatest solace in Lizzie Constable's companionship. The friendship lasted even after Lizzie had returned to her father's house, which stood in another quarter of the mile of cantonments from that of the Residency and the group of officers' houses, one of which was Captain Oliver's. Lizzie had only been in England when she was a baby. She had received her education from a busy mother who had herself been taught half a century before Girton days. Inevitably Lizzie's ac quirements were not far beyond those of an English girl a hundred years ago. Fortunately these acquire ments were by no means without value. She could"], [196, "184 IN THE CANADA'S MOUTH. read, write, and cipher, play a few simple tunes on the piano, behave like a lady and a sensible girl, ride re markably well, dance fairly and with great good-will, keep what house is left for Anglo-Indians to keep, and find a resource for every difficulty, as if she were already a Mem Sahib (matron) instead of aMis sie Baba (young lady). Lizzie was not very conscious of any deficiency in her education, partly because she shared her mother's lack of imagination, partly be cause she came in contact with other European girls still less endowed. She pointed out, to Bessie's horror, the showy daughters of a spenthrift officer and his shiftless wife, of whom it was darkly whispered that the flighty barrack-room belles could not read. No, Lizzie did not seriously regret anything she had missed in England, except the lingering remains of Bessie's plumpness and rosy cheeks, which if she had stayed on in Hindostan she should have lost in six weeks. As it was, the fresh girlish charms had not been altogether extinguished in the journey across the plains, and might endure in a subdued form for a season or two in Afghanistan. Here poor Lizzie was self-convicted and a little covetous, for she was a thin shrimp of a girl, sallow as if she had been a ranee or a begum. Lizzie's redeeming features were her white teeth, brown eyes, and the good-humoured smile of her wide mouth. She was much more plainly dressed than her friend Bessie, though Major Con-"], [197, "BESSIE AND IIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES. 185 stable was a step higher up in the service than Cap tain Oliver. \"There are so many of us,\" Lizzie would explain. \" We never get beyond calicos in summer, and we are glad of sheep-skin jackets in winter; even mamma has to be content with one Cabul silk.\" Lizzie had made the most of having been years on the spot. She had plenty of observation, and she had heard all her father's and mother's intelligent but not ill-natured talk on local subjects. She was qualified to be a capital cicerone for Bessie when the latter was able to look about her and interest herself in sur roundings which were both new and old. There were the narrow streets of the native town and the mud walled, mud-roofed houses, contrasting with spacious temple, minaretted mosque, and the massiveness and gorgeousness of the Grand Bazaar ; here were the European houses with their flat roofs and verandahs, into which so many windows opened that it appeared as if the houses were all windows and no doors. The compounds included gardens in which Bessie eagerly hailed such familiar objects as peas and potatoes, with sweet peas and geraniums not very different from those growing in her grandfather's garden far away in Dorsetshire. Nay, the English colony had so settled in the place that they had not only a mis sion compound, they had provided themselves with such national attributes as cricket and race grounds."], [198, "186 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. But what was very unlike England was the ominous number of forts dismantled or bristling with guns in evey direction ; chief among them the Bala- Hislar, citadel and palace in one. Lizzie explained these were necessary because Afghanistan was not even a tributary of England, only Queen Victoria had been somehow forced to interfere, put Shah Soojah on the throne and support him there, though he was so little the people's choice that the various tribes were in nearly open revolt, and had to be watched narrowly. In spite of the watching the natives committed outrages every day. Armed bands were continually coming down from the hills and lurking about the neighbouring villages, carrying off plunder and shooting at stray soldiers. It was hardly safe for any English officer to venture out after night-fall, unless he were on duty with a guard. The rebellious Afghans did not always wait till night-fall. Bessie had seen a party of from twenty to fifty of them scour past a corner on their active little ponies. The men wore, in place of the drab and red uniform of the sepoys, cotton or sheep-skin jackets, with nether garments and turbans of blue check having red borders, beneath which the keen, light-brown faces looked out sharply. For weapons these hill warriors had knives of various lengths in their kummer-bunds or sashes, and long rifles slung on their backs."], [199, "BESSIE AND LIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES. 187 The king could not keep his subjects quiet, though he sat all day cross-legged at one of the lattices of his palace with a telescope instead of a hookah in his hand, spying from afar the movements of his light footed, light-fingered followers. \" But that was nothing,\" Lizzie added in an under tone, as of one who was whispering treason, for Shah Soojah was only a native ruler, and everybody who knew anything could guess what native rulers were worth. But the English general, Lizzie and Bessie's own general, a gentleman and a soldier at the head of the European troops and the sepoys, over both Major Constable and Captain Oliver, was so ill and broken-spirited \u2014 it was piteous \u2014 that he could not order his regiments to assemble, form, march out, and conquer the insolent enemy. He could not bid the forts be manned and tell the gunners to open fire on the insurgents. He could not even determine whether to stay or go with his galled and dis heartened subordinates, and the helpless crowd at their heels. The fact was, though of course Lizzie did not know the whole truth, that he could only parley with Shah Soojah, lament his own age and in firmities, write to the Viceroy and beg his \u2014 General Elphinstone's recall. Until that came he let the turmoil wax louder and louder, and destruction ap proach nearer with more certain steps. Lizzie pointed out other notabilities to Bessie when"], [200, "188 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH she had the opportunity. Sometimes the girls saw the world from the verandahs of the respective houses. Sometimes the friends rode out together on what was becoming the constantly rarer occasions when Major Constable or Captain Oliver could take his daughter and her companion for a ride. Some times the pair had the use of Mrs. Constable's or poor Mrs. Oliver's palanquin, since ladies shrank more and more from venturing to walk abroad for the shortest distance with any number of servants for an escort though the season was so far advanced that the sun's rays, unless at mid-day, could be braved under the shelter of an umbrella without imprudence. The lady who drove in the finest carriage and wore the most costly shawls was the Envoy's wife, Lady Macnaghten. Then the tall gaunt woman who pre ferred on all occasions a riding-horse and a riding habit was a soldier's wife, and herself every inch a soldier ; she was a fit mate for him whom his men called \" Fighting Bob,\" and whom the more polite world knew as Sir Robert Sale. Bessie got a glimpse of him before he was sent down by his superior's orders, much against Sir Robert's will, to Jellalabad. He was a short corpulent man, as fond of gardening as of battles. On another occasion Bessie saw the great Scotch traveller, \" Bokhara Burnes,\" the Resident, who acted under the Envoy, Sir William Macnaghten. Sir"], [201, "BESSIE AND LIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES. 189 Alexander Burnes was not sort)-, but he had made a distinguished name for himself, been the lion of a London season, and was supposed to understand and hold the Afghans, whose sincere friend he had always been, in check. Lizzie had an opportunity of showing Bessie a very different sample of womankind from Lady Macnaghten and Lady Sale. This was an Afghan lady of rank, who deigned to show the holes for her eyes in her ruiband, or veil, as she rode, like Rebecca, on a camel through the principal street of Cabul. She was in full dress, on her way to visit some person of position, probably one of Shah Soojah's eight hundred wives and daughters. Her long silk gown was covered all over with dangling gold and silver coins. She had a breastplate of glittering coins descending below her waist. One hand, which projected from beneath her draper)7, was dyed crimson, as if it had been dipped in blood. At times the girl friends forgot all about the strange world round them, and the disturbances with which it was convulsed. Bessie and Lizzie were full of their occupations and amusements, hopes and dreams, like other girls. Bessie did everything she could for her father in an anxious deprecatory way, for she knew her mother must have managed much better. Bessie had little opportunity of renewing her acquaintance with Captain Oliver's habits and tastes, or of learning"], [202, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 190 his silent gratitude to her for trying her little best, being as cheerful as she could for his sake, and sparing him some of her girlish forlornncss. He was much abroad attending perpetual military councils which came to nothing, and striving along with his brother officers to keep up the morale of his particular company. After her father Bessie devoted herself to Dodo, or little George, and here she had her reward speedily. It hardly required a week for the small power in the house to elevate the last, biggest, cleverest \"Sissy\" he had known far above the ayah and the bearer, who spoiled the child inordinately. He had what sounded to the newcomer a marvellous baby command over a strange tongue which she had well nigh forgotten. But though he could so far comprehend the stories of tigers, serpents, and obi-women poured into his greedy ears, his Anglo-Saxon instincts liked still better Bes sie's tales of foxes and geese, and of a little boy lost in the snow on Salisbury Plain, found and saved by the shepherd's collies \u2014 well-nigh as brave and wise as the St. Bernard dogs, and as unlike as possible to the scavenger jackals of the native town. Lizzie Constable had a little sister who, in spite of Mrs. Constable's active dislike to nicknames, was familiarly known as \" Kitten,\" \u2014 perhaps for the reason that Dodo adored a great soft rusty-brown and black Persian cat called \" Cyrus,\" and next to Cyrus the"], [203, "BESSIE AND LIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES. 191 boy adored Kitten. She was more like a small squir rel or fox than a juvenile cat, for she was a red-headed, funny-faced mite, as quick for her age as Lizzie was for hers. Kitten could always divert Dodo with her queer tricks and grimaces, and win him from his most querulous humour, when the poor little fellow missed his mother's experienced care, and was driven half mad by the Cabul plague of flics. The two children would chase each other in and out of the verandah till the grown-up people's heads were in a whirl, and then nestle down in a little heap to rest \u2014 which meant Kitten's tongue wagging and Dodo's large light-blue eyes opening more and more widely in astonishment at her tales. In the meantime Bessie and Lizzie were looking over each other's wardrobes, telling each other how each did her hair \u2014 with practical illustrations, ex changing books and patterns for work, trying over all the music on the respective pianos when the Olivers' piano was open again, hemming and stitching for Mrs. Constable, who maintained an inexhaustible work-bag, out of which she distributed with liberal impartiality seams for the native tailor sitting cross legged in the verandah, and for willing and unwilling young allies. Lizzie and Bessie were willing enough, especially with winter at the door. They had not much distrac tion in fancy-work, for which few materials that"], [204, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 192 English women could use existed in Cabul, though the products of the looms of Cashmere and the em broidery frames of Dacca were still the wonder of Europe. The couple acknowledged the force of Mrs. Con stable's argument, that it was a disgrace for a girl to grow up idle and incapable, not qualified to put a stitch into her own clothes, or to do anything with her needle for father or brother or little sister, or for the poor, merely because the delinquent was in India or Afghanistan, and not in England. Single-minded, notable Mrs. Constable spoke as if all the daughters of England were still as diligent and useful as she had been in her young days. Happily she was a good deal of an oracle to Lizzie and to Bessie, who had been brought up by an old-fashioned grandmother. Certainly Bessie was a little perplexed about the keeping up of her French and German, with the solid reading and the steady practising which had also been enjoined on her. But she tried her utmost to meet and harmonise conflicting obligations. She was not the sadder ; on the contrary, she was comforted and rendered more nearly happy again by the busy life which attention to so many different claims implied. Indeed, Lizzie and Bessie, whether from constitu tion, character, or training, had no great fancy for lives of pure laziness or sheer trifling and mischief making, such as might have been heard of by the"], [205, "BESSIE AND LIZZIE IN THEIR HOMES. 193 hundred among the girls' country-women in the East. There was endless talk between the couple with regard to what they should do when they were more grown up, when Clara and Susie Oliver had come back, and all the boys and girls \u2014 down to Dodo and Kitten \u2014 were men and women, but were not yet scat tered far and near. Other conversations ranged from favourite pieces of poetry, of which Lizzie had a selec tion that she had been made to commit to memory by her mother, to tea-cake and pistachios. The range included the first picnic which was more than a family affair, the first ball, the hero and the husband, with the wedding dress and the bride's bungalow all com plete ; and in every situation the girls were to be busy. If they had not their little brothers and sisters to help to rear, Bessie and Lizzie were to assist in bringing up the soldiers' children, and to do what could be done for widows and orphans. The ambitious young women went so far as to propose to study the native dialects and ask the missionary for classes in his school. \" I do not know yet how we shall find time for everything, but I dare say we shall manage somehow,\" said Lizzie confidently. \" You know we must man age, and it will be ever so much easier when the tribes are mastered and we are free to go where we like.\" The girls had become such fast friends that they took to regarding the fact that they had both been christened Elizabeth as a singular and important coin cidence prophetic of their future alliance. o"], [206, "194 CHAPTER III. LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP, LADY MACNAGHTEN IN HER DARKENED DWELLING. In place of the tribes being mastered, their audacity and violence became every hour more rampant. The Afghans could be seen from the flat roofs of the European houses swarming at every available point. Their red or yellow flags were ostentatiously unfurled. When a regular skirmish was in view, each rider carried a foot soldier behind him who came fresh to the fray. It was impossible for the most supine mock king and the most white-headed, worn-out English general to shut their eyes any longer. At last the impatient captains were told to march out against the hostile villages, to open fire from the forts, which still had half or quarter their complement of men and guns. But, alas ! though there were many honourable ex ceptions of brave men in all ranks, staunch to the last,"], [207, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 195 despair had taken the place of impatience in more than the plastic, fickle sepoys and the common sol diers. The most promising chances were lost, sallies were languidly made, and ended in useless skirmish ing, with waste of strength and life. The fire from the forts, begun too late, and, misdirected, was only so much vain expenditure of good gunpowder in what were simply brilliant fireworks. Wrangling had taken the place of fighting, the helpless body was without a head, and the ravening foemen were pressing always more closely on their prey. There were hearts in the cantonments eating themselves out, their English and martial pride trampled in the dust, with resentment, indignation, anguish, and dismay. Oh ! for Fighting Bob back from Jellalabad, the old soldier of whom his men could cry exultingly in every difficulty, \" Bob has got us in, and Bob will bring us out.\" His wife, who should have been a soldier, chafed with the best man there under the mortification and suspense. Day after day she watched from the roof of her house the marshalling of the enemy on the neighbouring heights, where snow had begun to fall. She fed with greedy eyes on the encounters with the English force \u2014 sternly joyful when the Afghans were repulsed, bitterly hurt and deeply shamed when the detachments of sepoys, with the handfuls of Europeans, recoiled before the impetus of the charges from the swarming moun taineers. She could not rest day or night, she could o 2"], [208, "196 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. hardly eat or sleep, she was so engrossed by the game of war \u2014 sorry though the specimen was, of which she sent considerable reports to her husband. Lady Sale went out in the rout in the streets to meet and succour her dauntless young son-in-la,v as he was brought home with three stabs in his side, shoulder, and face, dealt by an assassin within the precincts of the king's palace. There had been an armed attack on the public buildings and the houses of the Europeans in the city, and Captain Sturt had volunteered to demand aid from Shah Soojah in vain. Among the houses threatened was that of Sir Alexander Burnes the Resident \u2014 the civilian second in authority to the Envoy, Sir William Macnaghten, \" Bokhara Burnes,\" the great traveller before he was forty, who had faith in his knowledge of the natives and their knowledge of his good feeling towards them. He had been warned of his danger, but refused in his impetuous way to believe in the warning. He was sitting at breakfast with a brother and a friend when the shouting mob surged up the street. He had so little doubt of his influence that he advanced fearlessly into the verandah, and attempted to address the raging people below. He was answered by the setting on fire of his house and a rush on the Shah's Treasury next door. Burnes's brother and friend defended themselves by firing down on the assailants, and in doing so one or both fell. There were fierce shouts"], [209, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 197 for Burnes to descend into the garden. He obeyed on the pledge that his life and that of his brother, who according to his belief was following him, should be spared. He was mercilessly cut down and hacked in pieces. Did his own German Ocean far away sob and moan for him ? Was there gloom on \" the braes of Angus \" which his fleet foot would never more tread ? The crime startled the youngest and most ignorant listener to the account of the cruel deed. Bessie and Lizzie had grown well-accustomed to pricking and spurring and shooting, even to wounded officers, their fathers' friends, brought in from the out-posts. The girls too had gone on the roofs of their houses, and, like the ladies who \"looked ower their hie castle was \" in the old ballads, gazed down with eyes almost as round and blank as Dodo's on the wild pageant. But that was war ; this was something different. Private houses surrounded and entered by violence, the un suspecting inmates overwhelmed by numbers, murder committed in broad day \u2014 the murdered man one in authority, a gentleman whom both Lizzie and Bessie had known well by sight ! This was not honourable war, such as every soldier's daughter had need to face with spirit and courage. This was savage treachery and brutal slaughter, from which human nature shrank shuddering. From that moment a broad contrast to what had existed before presented itself in the girls' thoughts,"], [210, "198 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. words, and acts. The whole became thoroughly tinged with the singular and tragic circumstances of the case. The young, like the old, were full of the situation, regarding it from every point, dwelling on it perpetually, speaking of nothing else. But the fact that Bessie and Lizzie were young produced one vital distinction. They could not realise in full the gravity and sombreness of the outlook ; the tenderness of their age was saved from being crushed by the buoy ancy and inexperience which accompanied the tender ness, to which all excitement has in itself a wonderful charm. The girls looked on and listened, from the small distance of their immaturity and domesticity, at the appalling scenes of the period with much the same thrill of horror and pity, and not without a sense of awed delight, that the same young people would have bestowed on a well-told ghost story. The one appeared about as real as the other. The most wildly conflicting rumours were rife, and were taken up by the juvenile audience in their most exaggerated forms. Now it was the provisions that were failing in the cantonments, and in order to anti cipate troops and families being starved to death, garrisons and households were called upon to put themselves at once on reduced rations. Bessie re flected, conscience-stricken, on the stores which must have been wasted in the beginning of her house keep ing, to which she had served no apprenticeship in the"], [211, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 199 East. She considered with at least equal consterna tion how dainty Dodo was, in spite of Mrs. Constable's hints, and how it was to be feared he would reject food altogether and precipitate his doom if he were reduced to rice and split peas. And Bessie had taken such motherly pride in her poor mother's boy's fair fatness ; yet she did not steel her heart to deny him more than a little bit of Cabul cake, and it was a thousand times worse than bidding her saces, or groom, put her poor pony Alloo-baloo (wild cherry) on half a feed of attah and borussa, ground grain and chaff. And if Bessie and Alloo-baloo had known it, this stinting in provender was only a prelude to a painful diet of bark and boughs of trees, to which all useless cattle and horse-flesh were soon subjected. But when she tried to arrange that Cyrus, Dodo's be loved cat, should not have such saucers of milk and plates of liver as he had disposed of formerly, his little master took it so much to heart that she dared not pursue her economies in this direction. She had to be content with secretly stinting herself at every meal, so that Captain Oliver, in addition to his other cares, had the apprehension that his young daughter Bessie's appetite was unaccountably failing her. Again it was the water, which was either to be cut off from the river or to be poisoned by the bhistees or water-carriers, so that the very thought of drinking \u2014 even of bathing \u2014 became a scare. But here there was"], [212, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 200 some relief in the snow, which was not confining itself to the hills, but lay on the house-roofs. Bessie and Lizzie had profound consultations whether it might not be collected in balls and concealed in the cellars. At least the girls would waste no more snow on sherbet, even though they should have rose-leaves to brew it with. The next thing was a truer rumour of the evacua tion of Cabul, with the falling back of the English and their sepoys on Jellalabad or Peshawur, the nearest station in Hindostan. But this welcome suggestion, to those to whom change was always \" lightsome,\" and who could not conceive the deadly difficulties and miseries of the undertaking, was evidently clogged by the round assertion that not half-a-dozen officers alone, but all the ladies and children, were to be left behind as hostages. Bessie had never seen her quiet father so roused and furious. But he was not aware that she heard him when he declared, what other maddened men vowed as passionately, that rather than trust his young daughter and little son to any brutal Afghan chief among them, Captain Oliver would count it greater kindness to run his children through with his own sword. Bessie crept away, cold, white, and shivering. She knew her father did not mean what he said \u2014 not unless in some ghastly extremity, against which she fell down on her knees and prayed desperately. Then she rose"], [213, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 201 and tried simply to trust in God and do her duty, and mind little Dodo to the last. That was her part; but she could not help dreaming for nights of Jephthah's daughter, offered up not as a thanksgiving for a nation's deliverance, but rather, like Iphigenia, as a sacrifice to its defeat and bitter humiliation. A third loud whisper bandied about was a wailing Oriental echo of the Europeans' fierce protest \u2014 a proof that all men are kin. Shah Soojah, a man of mettle in nothing else, announced that he too was to show his masterfulness and his defiance of the followers of Dost Mahommed, his rival, by putting to death his, Shah Soojah's, eight hundred specimens of womankind before he surrendered his palace to the conqueror. When Bessie Oliver heard of that pro jected huge massacre of native women, it sounded as if the deaths of a young English girl and a little boy put quickly out of pain by the father who loved them better than himself, were trifles by comparison hardly worth the mentioning. Mrs. Constable had been right. Bessie's mother was well off to have died when she did die, to be at rest far from these tortures and terrors ; and Clara and Susie were happy in their ignorance, away in England, dwelling amidst the clockwork regularity and cosy security of their grandfather's house. The sisters' chief trials would be that school discipline was still a little irksome, and that Miss Mompesson's girls,"], [214, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 202 the Olivers' fellow-pupils, were rather far advanced for the Anglo-Indians. England and Berry, could they continue the same in law and order, in peace and comfort, when such deeds were being done at Cabul ? In the end, the proposal of leaving the ladies and children behind as hostages was abandoned. But while the project was still mooted, and Bessie was low and nervous about it, she had another opportunity of witnessing, from the roof of the Olivers' house, one more of those costly displays of fireworks which meant firing too late and in vain on the rebels from the single fort which was left with a few men and some guns. Even Bessie knew how useless the exhibition was, yet her spirits rose at the sight, and she watched the course of each fiery ball with eager interest and something like triumph. But her gratification was nothing to Lady Sale's on the adjoining roof. The face of the soldier's wife was lit up by the red glow in the sky like that of a homely Bellona. Her cheeks had not been more flushed or her eyes more sparkling with joy when as a girl she looked with exultation on the loyal demonstrations in a country town on the king's birth day \u2014 the squibs and the crackers and the bonfire at the cross, which had ended in hearty toasts at the dinner-table and a merry carpet dance among the young people. The English households at a little distance from the Residency and the barracks had either perished"], [215, "LADY SA 1 E ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 203 in the destruction of their houses, or had taken refuge with professedly friendly chiefs, or had fled in time to the protection of their countrymen gathered together in military array and still presenting an armed front to the enemy. But there had been delay in the Constables' coming in. Major Constable, a man brave to rashness, had been persuaded that he could fortify his house and hold out until better counsels prevailed, relief came, or in some shape the English overcame. It could not be that a British force was to be beaten by robber tribes, though they mustered in hordes. Mrs. Constable would not yield to his wish that she and the children should leave him and repair to Captain Oliver's, and thus the girl friends were a good deal separated at a time when outward communication was all but barred. Then Bessie heard the gladdest news she had received for many a day. Major Constable had reluctantly relin quished his plan ; he, Mrs. Constable, Lizzie, and Kitten, and the remaining five were all coming in that very morning. Bessie would have their support and sym pathy. Mrs. Constable would take the management of the combined households into her able hands. Meat, bread and groceries for the table, not to say rice, fish, ghee (melted butter), and sweet and sour curd for true Mussulmans, over which nobody save themselves could have any control to speak of, would go three times as far as under Bessie's regime."], [216, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 204 Bessie Oliver was running about and actually humming a song while she made preparations for her guests, and told Dodo, who followed her like her shadow, that he would soon have his kitten to play with him again. On that very day the Envoy, Sir William Mac naghten, went out in peace to meet and treat with Akbar Khan, the young Afghan chief who had become the most prominent figure among the natives, since he was the son of Dost Mahommed, the brave usurper, who had been defeated and swept from the throne to make room for Shah Soojah. Dost Mahommed's captivity, along with that of his wives, who were all in the hands of the English in Hin dostan, formed a convenient plea for the turbulent temper of his son to seize upon. The rash, ill-omened meeting of the English Envoy with the dark-browed young chief, who assumed a kind of regal dignity, would have been at best a case of diamond cut diamond. Sir William Macnaghten, driven to des peration, had caught at a crafty proposal of Akbar's to come to terms on his own account by betraying the faithless chiefs around him, while in reality the Afghan was prepared to prove his patriotism to his countrymen \u2014 many of whom were present \u2014 by entrapping the English leaders into the power of their enemies. At the interview, held on a snow covered knoll, a signal was given, and the four"], [217, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSE-TOP. 205 English officers, invited to recline on rugs to show the strangers' confidence, were suddenly seized from behind. Akbar himself grappled with Sir William Macnaghten, who struggled violently in his captor's grasp. The young despot's ungovernable passions were roused ; he drew from his belt a pistol, which had been the Englishman's gift immediately before, and shot him, struggling, through the heart, his dead face retaining his last look of wondering horror. The officers who had accompanied Sir William were mounted on Afghan horses and carried off through the mob, hooting and striking at them, into captivity. One officer slipped from his horse and was cut to pieces. His fate was shared by Major Constable, who had come up at the crisis. He was stabbed and mortally wounded, dying where he fell, without a moment spared to cry to God or think of the widow and children he left in anguish and peril. Mrs. Constable and Lizzie heard what had befallen them on their way to the Olivers', and Bessie read what had happened the instant she looked in her friends' drawn and bloodless faces. Both woman and girl were tearless at first, for Lizzie had her mother's character, and took her cue from her. Mother and daughter still busied themselves, though it was half mechanically, with the care of the younger members of the family, and with the necessity of doing what"], [218, "206 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. the seniors could to prevent themselves being too great a burden on their neighbours. It was something terrible to Bessie to see Mrs. Constable with dry shining eyes, and a voice that did not break, but only took a harsh, strained cadence \u2014 a reverberation of the tumult within, assuming the care of the united households as Bessie had pictured her doing under happier circumstances, and Lizzie following her mother's directions with stumbling feet and eyes fixed as of one in a dream. At last Lizzie gave way and sobbed, \" Oh, papa, poor papa ! never to come home to us again ; and he made a joke with me when he went away this morning. My own papa ! I wish I had been there, Bessie ; but then mamma would have been left alone with the children, to think for them and work for them all by herself ; I could not bear that. Papa would not like it, though he was proud of mamma's doing so much when he was here. Mamma said, the second thing after the one cry that went through my heart, of ' Oh, Joe ! ' as if she were reproaching him for going away without her \u2014 ' I must go on and do my duty, and mind the children. It will not mend matters to fail there ; there will be time enough to grieve.' I suppose she meant that she and I might wait for night till we cried. Even then we must be careful not to awaken Kitten and the rest of them.\""], [219, "LADY SALE ON HER HOUSETOP. 207 \" Oh, Lizzie, I wish your mamma would not think of our convenience, \u2014 I am sure papa agrees with me, \u2014 and would let me do more for her and the children,\" whispered Bessie. \" You know how I love you all, and how I should like to serve you. And think what she did for my mother.\" \" Yes,\" said Lizzie, sedately; \" but it is better to let mamma go her own way, she knows best. To be occupied is a relief to her. I have heard her say that work is God's way of helping people to bear His will, and of keeping them from dying of sorrow. And oh ! Bessie, papa must think so too ; if he sees mamma and me minding the little ones, he will know we can bear everything.\""], [220, "208 CHAPTER IV BESSIE AND DODO IN THE CAMEL'S PANNIER ON THE RETREAT. Akbar Khan's outrage did not cause a common onslaught, and did not hinder further dealings with him. What was there left for beaten men to try when General Elphinstone was weak as water with age and despair, when Shelton, the second soldier in command, was impracticable so far as acting in con sort with his brother officers went, when the Envoy and the Resident were both slain ? A one-sided agree ment was drawn up and signed, that the English and their sepoys, general and camp-follower, man, maid, and child, to the number of 16,000, were to abandon Cabul and travel in mid-winter through some of the most frightful mountain passes the world has to show \u2014 not on one, but on a succession of days' marches southwards. The gain of this enormous risk was that Akbar"], [221, "6W THE RETREAT. 209 and the chiefs in league with him were to permit the retreat, were to prevent the hostile tribes from annihi lating the company, either before or after they started, and were to serve as their convoy on the way. Everything was fixed ; all that remained to be done was to make what provision could be attempted under the most adverse conditions for a worse than Arctic journey. So Bessie stopped working with Mrs. Constable and Lizzie at making some simple form of widow's weeds and of mourning for the fatherless children, in order to gather together all the warmest clothing that could be found to keep heat in freezing bodies. When it came to that, the ward robes of the family had been turned out beforehand. Fuel had been failing to such an extent that the English were reduced to burning whatever boxes and chests of drawers the owners could do without. The next thing was to determine which of the household stores were best calculated to sustain fainting strength, and could be packed within the small bulk allowed to the travellers. The old com fortable houses had been largely stripped already, and provisions were getting so scarce that there was little left to pick and choose from. On the last Christmas Day spent at Cabul a meagre festival had been eaten with heavy hearts. The final and hardest task was to destroy with tenderly reluctant hands what could not be carried v"], [222, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 210 away of letters, papers, and little familiar relics of the homes about to be abandoned. Bessie was past crying when she burnt the old hand-screens her mother had painted before her marriage, Captain Oliver's card-rack, the children's scrap-books, and so on. In the midst of the bustle, Bessie was called away to face a fresh trouble. Her father had suddenly been selected by the military council, who desired him to use his acquaintance with the country and knowledge of the dialects in seeking to take a despatch to Can dahar. He was to set out in a civilian's dress, the despatch hidden about his person, with no attendant except one trustworthy native, and try to make his way by a circuitous route among the more friendly Kuzzilbashes and their allies till his goal was reached. There was no questioning the commission ; the more perilous it was, the more it was binding, without a moment's hesitation, on a soldier. His duty to his sovereign and his service first ; but one could not say his duty to his family second, because loyalty to the one involved loyalty to the other. After all, Bessie and little Dodo would be no worse off than other women and children whose husbands and fathers were absent, like Sir Robert Sale and Colonel Lay cock, or killed, like Sir William Macnaghten and Major Constable. Bessie had Mrs. Constable to advise her ; the girl and Dodo would be with the"], [223, "ON THE RETREAT. 211 Constables, and doubtless would fare as well as any of the party. Nevertheless, Captain Oliver spent his last precious moments in Cabul reiterating the most anxious directions to Bessie, and hurrying hither and thither, bespeaking what aid he could procure for her. \" I need not tell you to look after your little brother, Bessie, for my sake and your poor mother's,\" he said ; and he added from a full heart words which were sweet even at that moment in his young daughter's ears : \" I know you will do all you can ; you have been a second mother to him, child as you are yourself, already. But oh ! my girl, take care of yourself. Keep close by Mrs. Constable and the other ladies. Never stray from them. Remember your mother and me. Don't lose heart if you can help it. God bless you, my dear, and take care of you, since I cannot,\" He gave her one long hug and was gone. When Captain Oliver was taking his parting kiss of Dodo, the child was as usual lugging about the patient Persian cat. \" I am afraid you must give up puss too, my little captain,\" said the father to the son ; \" you see we have all of us to give up something. Come, we'll hand over Cyrus to the chowkedar \" (night watchman). \" He'll keep your cat for you, my man, and Sissy will not be further vexed by bringing about the parting.\" p 2"], [224, "212 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. \"No, no, fader,\" resisted the child ; \" Cy will go with me, Cy wants to. He can ride in his basket. Nursie says he came all the way from Simla in a band-box when he was a kit. No, not to chowkie, or Cy will swear like a trooper.\" \" Very well, my boy,\" yielded the man, not thinking that his consent would be acted upon. When all was ready next morning, those that were left of the Olivers and Constables ate their breakfast, their final meal in Cabul, as more distinguished people, Lady Sale and her daughter, ate theirs, cooked, to Dodo's delight, over kindled splinters fresh hacked from the family dining-table. Then as many jackets, cravats, and muffatees as could be heaped on a child were added to little Dodo's astrakhan coat and cap. Bessie put on her mother's furred pelisse, which she had vainly striven to get Mrs. Constable to wear in stead of her cloth mantle. The girl took the boy by the hand and led him through the rows of weeping, even howling, native servants, clanking their bangles and prostrating their turbans. It was certain that the wearers of the bangles and turbans would fare but badly without their European employers. Dodo still had enough power in his small arms, stiffened as they were with many integuments, to hold Cyrus in triumph. The great cat curled meekly round in the little fellow's arms, and laid one furry cheek to the child's face. Al together the living wrap promised to be the most"], [225, "ON THE RETREAT. 213 available of any. It struck practical Mrs. Constable in this light. \" I declare the beast will keep warmth in the boy better than you could do, Bessie \u2014 better than I shall manage with my Harry, though I mean to hold him in my arms if he will only sit still there. A useless mouth is a great consideration on such a march as we are going to make, but a cat's mouth is easily filled, and the creature has seven lives, so that even though we have to drop him on the way, he may have a chance.\" It was a sharp frosty morning, with a sky of the deepest purple blue overhead, and more than eight inches of hard snow underfoot. The date was the 6th of January, 1842, a memorable date to the 16,000 people, who, like the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt, formed a mixed multitude. It was composed of white and brown, soldier and civilian, master and servant, man, woman, and child. They assembled from early morning, though the barometer was below freezing point, in something like military order, but still more in a confused mass, at one of the gates of Cabul. Some soldiers of Captain Oliver's regiment escorted the Olivers and Constables to the gate. Already the deserted cantonments were filling with the enemy ; already, in spite of all treaties, the Afghans were preparing to fall on the rear of the fugitives, who, disorganised and maddened, would throw down baggage, stores, and arms, and would lie down to die on the crimsoned snow."], [226, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 214 In front marched a broken force consisting of detachments from many branches of the service, to judge by the scarlet jackets of English infantry, the red and drab of the sepoy regiments, the blue of the artillery, the green ofthe Bengal cavalry, \u2014 a blending of hues as in Joseph's coat of many colours, which was also to be dyed one sanguine tint. With the com panies was their aged general, who had sought bravely in his day, but his last battle was over long ago, and he was borne away to die as he had little dreamt. Several guns were dragged along by bullocks with toil and pain. Akbar Khan had suffered the shattered army to take these guns, knowing well that their car riage would only serve as a miserable encumbrance. Other bullocks transported the waggons with the money-treasure and the food for the crowd. The ladies and children were for the most part in panniers on camels. They were to go with a guard in advance of the main body. Bessie was to ride with Dodo and his cat, and what luggage they could take, in one pannier, balanced by another which was to hold Lizzie and a few more of the Constables. Mrs. Con stable was to be on a second camel with the remainder of the family and household goods \u2014 such as bedding, which could not be done without. As Bessie was mounting, Mrs. Laycock came by. The lady and the girl had enjoyed few opportunities of meeting lately, and Mrs. Laycock stopped a second"], [227, "ON THE RETREAT. 215 to exchange a greeting. She looked calm, almost strong and bright. \" You and I are fated to be fellow-travellers, Bessie. Oh, you have your little brother, and poor Mrs. Con stable has all her six children with her ! Oh dear ! what will she and you do ? I am so thankful my girls are safe at home.\" As it happened, Bessie and Mrs. Laycock did not journey together again. The poor lady fainted with fright and weakness before the first halting-place was gained. She had some of her own servants with her, and the jemadar, or principal man, took it upon him to convey his mistress to the house of an ameer who was understood to have nothing to do with the recent disturbances. So far the ameer vindicated his inno cence by showing Mrs. Laycock all the hospitality in his power \u2014 no doubt she reckoned it deficient enough \u2014 by protecting her during the panic, and taking her eventually to Peshawur. Her very weakness saved her from the straits undergone by her countrywomen. Some of the ladies were on horses and ponies. Among these riders were Lady Sale and her daughter, who agreed by preference to mingle with the troops. The tall, erect figure of Sir Robert Sale's wife did not suit il! with the figures of the soldiers around her. She looked as if she might carry pistols at her saddle bow and use them with effect when necessary, might lead a charge at a push, and never draw rein or falter"], [228, "216 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. for the fiercest Afghan in her path. No more daunt less heart beat in any man's jacket than throbbed behind the green riding-habit. Poor Lady Macnaghten was less conspicuous than when her carriage was the finest in Cabul, and took the first place in the procession to hear the band play on the summer evenings. If the insurrection had been delayed for only a couple of months longer she would have been queening it in Bombay, of which her warm-hearted, credulous, scholarly husband had been appointed governor. As it was, she was not merely crushed by the fact of her widowhood, she cowered under a piece of knowledge which would have sent fire into Lady Sale's veins, and caused her to cry aloud for vengeance. In the great bazaar where the Envoy's wife had been wont to go in state to make her purchases which the obsequious native merchants could not bring to her house for approval, the mangled body of the Envoy was at that moment brutally exposed. The cavalcade was allowed to move off unmolested. Half a hundred swarthy faces under turbans looked out impassively, without even an expression of re joicing at the departure. Latterly the life of the dwellers in the cantonments had been like the inhabitants of a besieged city. There was a sense of liberty in going forth, even in this fashion ; and Jellalabad, the destination of the"], [229, "ON THE RETREAT. 217 great company, the fort held by Fighting Bob and his men, was not farther off than an English coach could have reached in less than a day. But unfor tunately no English coach ever travelled by such roads, and it would have required not one but a myriad of coaches to convey the beaten host and its motley attendants. The tingling cold was not without its invigorating element, especially to the young. Not only Dodo and Kitten shouted with glee, Bessie and Lizzie as they involuntarily nodded to each other, keeping time with the jerking step of the animal that bore them, ex changed a faint tinkle of laughter unheard between them since Major Constable's death. The first great trouble was the crossing of the rapid Cabul river, swift enough to remain unfrozen, on planks laid on gun-carriages. The temporary bridge shook with every man and beast's tread, and it was crossed not by one or two feet, but by the hurrying feet of thousands, breaking through all regulations, pushing forward, struggling, jostling, kicking for pre cedence. The crazy structure swayed and tottered till there was imminent danger of its heavy load being precipitated into the ice-cold eddying water. The horsemen and women who forded the river were well off by comparison, though the long skirts of the lat ter, wet and frozen to the knees, were not unthawed for many days."], [230, "218 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. The Olivers and Constables stumbled across the bridge, they knew not how, only they turned their eyes instinctively from the rush of the foam-flecked water, and bade their quaking hearts beat less vio lently. Dodo whimpered and asked why his camel had been put in a charpoy, or bed swung on poles, and why the porters did not hold the charpoy more steadily. From nine in the morning till four in the afternoon, even with sundry halts, was a severe spell of such travelling for women and children. Long before four, when the first encampment was made, the chatter of the children had ceased, any faint tinkle of youthful laughter was still, the very men and women went on in dogged silence. There were only a few small tents pitched for those who could not endure the bitter night air, and these scanty shelters were of course densely crowded. Mrs. Constable and her troop had not more than a minute corner for their accommodation. It afforded some diversion to the tired children to arrange it for the night under Bessie's and Lizzie's supervision. It was like playing at keeping house, the play on a grand scale, with a fine flavour of reality in it, and the des perate make-shifts had some fun in them when they were tried for the first time. While Mrs. Constable got out what provisions she had been able to bring with her, the others, down to Dodo and Kitten, who"], [231, "ON THE RETREAT. 219 were forced to keep on their gloves to preserve their blue little fingers from frost-bites, worked at helping to scrape away the snow and lay down the rugs, mats, and mattresses which must serve for seats and tables as well as beds. There were no camp-fires outside, but one was kindled in a neighbouring tent on which kettles were boiled, so that hot water could be got. There was a successful attempt at tea. Hunger made the ship biscuits as appetising as the finest tea-cake in the world. A good-natured ayah who was waiting on another occupant of the tent brought the children some nans, or native cakes, and sugar-candy. Dodo and Kitten were positively uproarious over the divi sion of the spoil. It was only when night fell and the intense cold penetrated through every defence that the shivering children grew peevish, and the young hearts that had found animation and amusement in the obligation to exert themselves, and the unheard-of and grotesque nature of their surroundings, waxed heavy ; while the old regarded with despair a future progress under circumstances still worse than had gone before \u2014 worse than burdened thinkers dared conceive. Dodo began to cry for his ayah, as if her nose-jewel was the very cynosure of his eyes. Cyrus could not console him, which was the less to be wondered at, since the Persian, his tail in the air, insisted on walking about within the circumscribed limit, and"], [232, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 220 mewing wildly his protest against the extraordinary proceedings of his owners. Happily there was such a hum without and within, intensified by the crying of other children, the groaning of exhausted camels, the lowing of uneasy bullocks, the stamping of horses, and the barking of pariah dogs hovering on the out skirts of the bivouac, that the performances of Dodo and Cyrus became such a small symphony in the general concert, they could not be supposed capable of disturbing the repose of the most nervous sleeper. Bessie had no fear of adding to the clamour when she lay down with Dodo and softly sang and rocked him on her breast to slumber. Then Cyrus, tired of his manifestations, brushed up to his friends and condes cended to be stroked into quiesence also. The hubbub became quieter. Through an opening no bigger than an eye in the tent curtains Bessie could see one of the myriads of stars which God guides in their course. Was it shining down on her father in his solitary, perilous expedition? Would God guide the stars and not care for the devoted man who had gone with his life in his hand to obey his chiefs and bring successor to his fellows ? Bessie slept a little and dreamt still of the frost and snow, which in their rigour were threatening the lives of all around her. But the frost and snow of Bessie's dream were only those which are seasonable, and, unless to the very poor, joyous attributes of winter in England."], [233, "ON THE RETREAT. 221 She was again in the garden at Berry, looking across the lightly -powdered holly-hedge to the pond on the common, where men and boys were skating and sliding amidst shouting and laughter. She was watching the lusty waggoner driving by, and pausing to enjoy the scene, his breath steaming like the breath of his horses, his cheeks an apple-red, his eyes shining. Grandpapa had come out and was making a snow-man, with a carrot for a nose, for \" little Bessie \" ; but grandmamma thought she was standing still too long, and sent out the youngest housemaid to play at snowballs till the bell rang, and Bessie hurried in to change her frock and come down fresh and glowing to the first mince-pies of the season."], [234, "222 CHAPTER V. A CHILD LOST IN THE KOORD-CA1SUL PASS. That first day's march was followed by a second, the retreat growing always more of a rout, \u2014 soldiers and camp-followers, men, women, and children, becoming more and more inextricably and fatally mingled. No bugle sounded for the morning start or the afternoon halt. The greater part of the guns, against which the enemy had repeatedly charged, were spiked and abandoned. The whole way was strewn with plun dered baggage and trodden-down rations. The cold was so terrible that strong men as well as the wounded and weak were found frozen to death under its iron grasp. Afghans, ominously like the tribes told off to play the part of guardian angels and escort the English through the passes, hovered in dark crowds all around, falling ever and anon on the front or the rear, aiming at the defenceless, cutting at those who were down, leaving a red track on the white snow."], [235, "A CHILD LOST. 223 Bessie had shuddered to see her camel pick its way among stalwart figures stretched in every attitude without motion, and faces with an ashen grey tint showing through their brown, turned up to the sky. Dodo had shrieked at beholding these sleepers, and clamoured for them to be awakened that they might go home and lie down on their mats. At last the awful Koord-Cabul Pass was ap proached. It had been cut by the fierce torrent through naked rocks which glistened with ice and glittered with snow as they towered high on either hand, and stretched for full five miles in front. The moment the company entered the jaws of the pass, volleys of musketry from the foe, stationed behind every beetling crag, came pouring down on the fugitives. Bessie had to clasp Dodo more closely than ever to her breast, and bend her slim body to shelter him from the steel rain. He struggled to see what kind of birds the gentlemen were shooting, while Kitten Constable, possessed by a recollection of a wounded quail which had once been given her for a pet, began to make clever little plots to slip down from her pannier and go in search of the spoil of the guns. As the child, in spite of the hardships she was sharing, continued full of spirit and wilfulness, it was judged more prudent to remove her from Bessie's camel and mount her on that of Mrs. Constable, where Kitten could be more directly under the eye"], [236, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 224 of the mother, who was accustomed to exact prompt obedience from her children. Lady Sale had been shot through the wrist, and was making light of the injury ; Mrs. Constable was quickly concealing a hole and stain in the cloth of her mantle. Starvation stared the band in the face, and was already busy with the wretched camp followers, who had nothing to feed upon save the carcases of camels and horses. The pangs of hunger were kept as long as possible from the English women and from the children, for whom milk had utterly failed. Water itself was hard to get when, near as the river ran, those who went to draw from it were pitilessly shot down by the unerring marksmen on the heights above. An English officer, a lad not three years older than Bessie, with his head bandaged to cover an ugly cut from one of the Afghan knives, hearing Dodo crying with thirst, brought him a cup full of sherry, and when she demurred at the draught, told her that \" little beggars \" not a day older were drinking the wine with impunity. As he spoke a button of his jacket gave way, and she caught a glimpse of a dull scarlet and faded gold rag within, which he hastily thrust out of sight. \" I wonder he wears so fine a vest,\" said Lizzie Constable, half stupidly, when he was gone. \" Vest ! \" cried her mother. \" It is the colours of his regiment that he has wound about his body, and"], [237, "A CHLLD LOST. 225 is seeking to secure as long as he lives. God bless the boy ! Your father would have called it right soldierly conduct on his part.\" Another day in the dragon throat of that pass, and it seemed as if not a woman or child could come out alive, even if a handful of men struggled through the melee. Already 3,000 persons were believed to have perished, by far the larger number camp-followers, but about 500 soldiers of the hapless army. Captain Sturt, Sir Robert Sale's son-in-law, was mortally wounded, lifted into a camel-pannier, and jolted along till he breathed his last in the presence of his un happy young wife. Camels were shot under their riders. Bessie saw a delicately - nurtured woman toiling along on foot. She was carrying her child in her arms, through the deep snow, among the dead and dying. She was wading across streams of icy water knee-deep, and escaping as by a miracle from being thrown down in the strong tide of desperate human beings and animals floundering helplessly and aimlessly. She seemed to bear a charmed life under the sharp fire. Yet as she went an Afghan, who did not stop to strike her down, snatched the shawl from her quivering shoulders. Bessie's camel escaped.

Yet Cyrus was faithful to his little master, did not seek to quit him, and played his part, as had been foreseen, in keeping warmth in the worn out child, fast growing chill beyond the power of recovery. Every time Dodo fell asleep now, Bessie dreaded that he would not awaken again. Sometimes the dread ceased to appal her ; it had rather a certain charm. Better thus than that he should be called upon to undergo much more suffering, or that he should live after she had fallen back pierced by one of those pitiless bullets, or stabbed by one of those cruel knives. If Dodo were to go first in gentle sleep, then poor Bessie felt so weary it seemed very possible that she would sleep also \u2014 sleep as soundly and dream lessly. If only somebody would console her father, \u2014 supposing he ever arrived at Candahar, \u2014 tell him that she, his Bessie, had done her best, and that in the end she and Dodo had gone, quietly and peacefully, in the middle of the wild strife, to rejoin their mother. The last halt came, and then a new cause of consternation arose. It was discovered that, in the utter confusion ofthe final effort against unspeakable odds, more than one poor woman among the soldiers' wives had been carried off by the Afghans, and more than one little child was missing. Bessie had striven to do her father's bidding in"], [239, "A CHILD LOST. 227 keeping with Mrs. Constable, but for the last six hours she had been parted from her. Bessie's camel, which also carried Lizzie Constable, one of her sisters instead of Kitten, and a ten-years-old brother, had gone on, while Mrs. Constable's camel had first been delayed in the throng, and then, when those in advance did not see, had fallen and was unable to rise and proceed further. Mrs. Constable, with her youngest, Harry, Kitten, and the daughter next to Lizzie in age, had been forced to alight. A sergeant in her late husband's regiment had seen her plight, and succeeded in getting a pony, which the weary woman, encumbered with her child, had mounted. The half-grown girl and Kitten had been committed to the care of the man, who lifted them on his own horse. He had hardly done so when there was a charge of the enemy from the neighbouring height, and the last thing Mrs. Constable had beheld, before she was borne away in the headlong flight, was her champion fighting encumbered with her chil dren. When Bessie and Lizzie sound the mother they knew in a moment something was dreadfully wrong. The same wide-open, fixed look was in her eyes that had been there when she first heard the news of her widowhood. There was the same tragic strain in every line of the honest, hard-favoured features, while she laboured to chafe little Harry's feet, powerless y 2"], [240, "228 IN THE CAAWON'S MOUTH. with cold, and to feed him with some spoonfuls of rice and melted butter. \" Come here and help me, Lizzie ; you and the other children must have your supper, and some sort of beds must be made up for you,\" she said in a hoarse, hurried, unnatural voice. Lizzie gave way to her feelings. \" Oh, mamma, let me go back and seek for Kitten and Jenny. It is not dark yet ; nobody will meddle with me, and I'm sure I don't care though they did. I'm not a bit frightened. I'm not tired ; I can run and slip through the crowd.\" \" Hold your tongue, Lizzie,\" said her mother sternly. \" I forbid you to stir. Do you not see that I am here ? Do you think that I would stay for the dark or the cold, for the dropping shot or the sharp knife-blades, if it were not that if I went you would all perish ?

There is a little more rice in that bag, and here is a bottle of ghee ; somebody, I do not know who it was,\" she explained a little wildly, \" brought it to me.

In the course of the night Jenny Constable was brought in half dead with fatigue and fright. Her original protector had been killed, but she had found others who had helped her in her strait. She knew nothing of Kitten. The child had been last seen in the arms of an Afghan. Little red-haired, mischievous, affectionate Kitten was gone none knew whither. It was impossible to stay to find her. Dodo would wait long to be cheered by his little playmate. The sprightly, naughty child, hugged the one moment, scolded or laughed at the next, was to become for many a day only a vague fear and sorrow-ful memory to her brothers and sisters, and a source of unfathom able anguish to her mother."], [242, "230 CHAPTER VI. STITCHING TURKE\\'-RED COTTON AND CONCOCTING COFFEE IN AKBAR KHAN'S FORTS. Human nature, whether of Mussulman or Christian, victor or vanquished, could not bear that such horrors should be indefinitely prolonged \u2014 a compromise must be at least attempted. An offer was made by Akbar Khan. He was the strangest anomaly in these strange, sad scenes. He was the very type of what has been judged to be the Oriental nature in full bloom \u2014 fierce, crafty, and ambitious, vain and capri cious, but not altogether ungenerous. The one moment he was barbarous, the next he was un expectedly humane, even kind. In a fit of ungovern able passion he shot the defenceless Envoy. In swift relenting he drew his, Akbar's, sword and used it freely in the protection of another Englishman. And Akbar's own princely hand, as he and his followers counted it, dressed the festering wounds of a third"], [243, "STITCHING TURKEY-RED COTTON. 231 prisoner in his power. Whether true or false his assertion that he could not restrain the hostile tribes, he was himself the convoy of the company which had left Cabul on the 6th of January, and been slaughtered like a flock of sheep on the awful journey. Akbar Khan appeared like the dark moving spirit of the tribulation at every stage of the road. He might have been actuated by insolence or pity, or a mixture of both, which seems the most probable conjecture of the three. For aught that anybody can tell to this da)-, but for his presence, sinister as it was, the common destruction might have been speedier and more complete. Suddenly he proposed that the ladies and children, who would never otherwise emerge alive from the Khybur Pass, should be intrusted to his keeping to be conducted finally to Pcshawur. Lady Macnaghten, Lad)- Sale, and the rest would in the meantime be taken by Akbar and his force to one of his strongholds, and there defended and cared for. There was nothing for it but to accept the overture, with the amendment that the husbands of the ladies who still had husbands by their sides, should be per mitted to go with their wives and children into what was virtually captivity. There was a piteous inter view between miserable Lady Macnaghten, worn and travel-stained, and Dost Mahommcd's son, with his Jewish face under his immense turban, and his slim figure in his gold-embroidered scarlet dress.

He on his part deigned to smooth his haughty, swarthy brow, and to speak reassuring words to his victim. Yet he did not hesitate to refer in the hear ing of the shuddering listener to his deed of violence, while he made the allusion in the form of a vehement protest that he would give his right hand if the deed could be undone. The Olivers and Constables were, of course, included in the new arrangement. It brought about their separation from the retreating army, and their transfer to the centre of a powerful body of Afghan cavalry. These accompanied the party by rugged mountain paths to a fortress of the chiefs, where the captives derived a faint comfort from meeting two or three other prisoners and friends among the officers already hostages to Akbar Khan. The stay at the first fort was of the briefest dura tion. The next morning the little party were on their toilsome way again, accomplishing a ghastly retracing of their steps, which was like crossing a hideous battlefield where the fight had been hottest, and the dead lay unburied, stiff and stark under the winter sky.

But when these horrible sights were left behind, there remained the consoling fact of the comparative safety of the women and children, together with a fresh arrival of captives like themselves, wounded and broken-hearted also, but still fellow-countrymen and friends. Among them was kindly old General Elphin stone, who, in addition to his other misfortunes, had received a stray shot in the rout, and the general second in command. These were more hostages demanded by Akbar to lay the pride of the English in the dust. In addition, they might secure immunity for his deeds, and insure the safety of his father, Dost Mahommed, and his wives, detained by the English in Hindostan. Akbar tried to make a third stipulation : that the English garrison should withdraw from Jellalabad. But the general there, whom men called \" Fighting Bob,\" was of a different stuff from the infirm man whose incapacity for his post had been his worst torture at Cabul. Sir Robert Sale had a brave, simple heart, which had not only delighted in his peas and roses, it had exulted in the regular step and eyes right and left \u2014 like the eyes of one man \u2014 of his troops in peace, and in their firmness under fire and"], [246, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 234 their dash at the enemy when war was the order of the day. He might be moved to the quick by the peril of his wife and daughter, but at the worst both they and he could die doing their duty \u2014 a hundred times sooner death for all than betrayal of the trust which his country and his Queen had reposed in him. There were more sore days' travel up the most break-neck and rock)- tracks, and an unsheltered bivouac by7 a brawling river, where not only men, but women and children, had to lie down beneath the stars, the horsewomen, like gallant Lady Sale, with their saddles for pillows, the riders in the camel panniers crouching down in them for a barrier against the deadly cold. The river had to be crossed at a dangerous ford, where many cattle and several human beings were swept away. But here Akbar came out at his best. He caused his soldiers to carry across the women and children, sitting astride behind the men on the sure-footed Afghan horses. He himself took over the most delicate of the ladies on his own horse. The first halt for a day was at Tugree. Here Bessie Oliver, Lizzie Constable, Dodo, and even Cyrus began to hold up their heads and look about them. A room and a wood fire, though there was no vent for the smoke except by a hole in the roof, was like a palace chamber. The cooked tail of a sheep,"], [247, "STITCHING TURKEY-RED COTTON: 235 and a lump of brown sugar filled with nuts, were the most exquisite morsels ever tasted. The native ladies \u2014 the real mistresses of the mud-walled fort, who rose from their cushions and threw down their fans in order to show womanly kindness to their desolate Feringhee sisters \u2014 were as angels of light. The little gleam of solace and sympathy was needed before the grief of the news which, to be sure, the children failed completely to apprehend. Akbar Khan took care to let his prisoners know7 that all was over with the remainder of the company that had marched from Cabul ten days before 16,000 strong. The disorganised remnant that the ladies had left behind had toiled a little further to the Jugclulluck Pass, which they found not only held by masses of the enemy, but barricaded against the approach of the strangers. There the last pretence at a disciplined force sold their lives dearly, or broke up into straggling groups, and were cut down as the)' sought to save themselves. Only one man, Dr. Brydon, reeling in his saddle from loss of blood, faint with hunger, parched with thirst, his spent horse stumbling at even step, reached the gate of Jellalabad, the solitary bearer of the tragic tale. He is as pathetic a figure as history can show. It was a boon that the halt day at Tugree happened on a Sunday. The company could sit clown in rows, forming a little congregation, and have the church"], [248, "236 IN THE CANNON'S MO UTH. service read from a Bible and prayer-book, which somebody had been able to rescue and secrete as his or her greatest treasure. The solemn yet familiar words heard once more brought an assurance to guile less ears that God had not forsaken the helpless. The young people present could not quite understand why some of their elders hid their faces and wept more passionately than these worshippers had yet lamented their plight. Mrs. Constable was among the weepers, shedding hot scalding tears for the first time since the loss of Kitten \u2014 to the saving of the mother's brain, however brief the indulgence. But neither was this fort the prisoners' abiding place. Foot-sore, heavy-hearted, well-nigh beyond further exertion, they were still called on to \" move on,\" as refractory tramps are jogged forward by zealous policemen. Women and children and wounded men had orders to rise in the raw cold of the early morning, gather together their slender possessions \u2014 consisting mainly of the clothes they wore day and night \u2014 and set out on fresh toilsome, unknown camel journeys. These took the wayfarers over sterile plains or through deep defiles, past primitive, mud walled, thatch-roofed villages, down into compara tively cultivated valleys, and mounting again to barren uplands, till the captives could be immured in some more inaccessible stronghold of the conqueror.

The future was dark with uncertainty. Indeed, there were appalling whispers that Dost Mahommed's son had no thought even of Peshawur, to which he had pledged himself to take the forlorn party. It was said that when he dreaded the consequences of his acts, his sombre meditations were directed to the steeps of the Caucasus and the deserts and dungeons of Bokhara. English soldiers had never penetrated into these wilds, which had sad associations with the name of the murdered Resident, Sir Alexander Burnes. Bessie and Lizzie might languish till they were grey-headed ; even Dodo might live and die in the dreariest exile and imprisonment, if he did not come soon to a violent end. But hope beats high in young breasts, and presently welcome compensations began to be granted.

Why, Bessie, finding a pocket-comb, actually had the spirit to make Dodo's one flaxen curl, extending from his blistered forehead to his crown ! All the time he was calling on her to wash and comb Cyrus. He antici pated the operation by washing himself, licking his poor fur, matted in tufts and coming off in patches, as sleek as tongue of cat could lick it. Still greater boons were at hand. Portions of Moultan chintz and Turkey-red cotton cloth were given to the ladies, and never in their most prosperous days had the richest silks or the most cobweb muslins been as welcome. It was the Turkey-red cotton which fell to Mrs. Constable's share. Under her direction Bessie and Lizzie's fingers were again busy, this time in manufacturing the most ordinary changes of raiment. What did it matter though they were somewhat grotesque in material and colour, if they were only fresh and clean? A Turkey-red nieht-dress or a chintz chemise would do as well as another, and Dodo looked charming in the first. Scarlet was not mourning, yet the colour, like the crim son dye of the Afghan ladies' hands, was significant enough. Bessie kept that reflection to herself with a hard-drawn breath, and preferred to remind Lizzie, who was not haunted with associations, that the"], [251, "STITCHING TURKEY-RED COTTON. 239 virtuous woman in Proverbs had clothed her house hold in scarlet. A higher gain, the highest of all, was that Akbar Khan, under certain conditions, to serve his own pur pose, with the idea that the hearts of the stubborn English garrison at Jellalabad would not be able to hold out against the heartrending appeals which must be addressed to them, allowed communications, including letters and packages, to pass between Jella labad and Budeeabad. Little did Akbar guess the nature of some of the communications. It was said that under a little provocation he dictated to Lady- Sale the terms of surrender, which she was to impress on \" your devil of a husband.\" Lady Sale's answer to that commission was to charge Sir Robert not to think of her and their daughter, but to do his duty at an)- cost. There was a light of sardonic laughter in the lady's eye when she greeted her conqueror after wards. From Jellalabad Bessie Oliver received the glad tidings which atoned for much, that her father had not only been able to carry out his mission to Canda har successfully, with great credit to himself, he had managed to go on to Jellalabad, and was there safe and unhurt with Sale. Money and what necessaries could be got were care fully forwarded by Captain Oliver to Bessie and Mrs. Constable, as the friends of the other ladies sought to"], [252, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH 240 supply them with similar solaces. Among the neces saries were old newspapers and odd volumes of books, including one or two lesson-books. Bessie had serious thoughts that she ought to employ a little leisure at her disposal in rubbing up her accomplishments and teaching Dodo his letters. There was no lack of time, for the English company were destined to stay at Budeeabad for three long months, coming there in what was still the depth of winter, and not leaving till April sunshine and April showers had succeeded the snows of January. The former mistresses of luxurious bungalows occupied themselves with bringing about improve ments in the domestic affairs of the strange colony. The gaolers were coaxed to add peas and radishes to the chupatties or wheaten flour cakes which served both for plates and bread. The native cakes were eaten to the greasy mutton and rice which George Lawrence, the worthy brother of two yet more famous Lawrences, undertook to part fairly among the hungry diners. The indefatigable ladies roasted rice and barley, ground them between stones, and pouring hot water upon them, sweetened the drink and cheerfully dispensed it as an excellent substitute for the small importations of tea and coffee which had been speedily exhausted. The notable matrons also contrived with a little assistance from the more obliging of the natives, to have the clothes of the colony washed,"], [253, "ST1TCHLNG TURKEY-RED COTTON. 241 beating them smooth in the hand, and spreading out the washing to dry on the flat roof of the fort. These were useful occupations, but simple amuse ments were not wanting. The gentlemen constructed primitive backgammon and draught boards. Bessie and Lizzie learnt to play the games, and had many a keen contest of luck and skill together, where the girls sat cross-legged on the floor. But they were most triumphant when they persuaded Mrs. Constable to finger the pieces, which she did, half with a melan choly mechanicalness, half with her irresistible in clination to do whatever came to her hand with all her might. The quiet games were not all. The little children could not be suffered to droop. Bessie could hardly believe her eyes and her ears when she found herself scampering after Dodo, who fled in his turn, his flaxen hair streaming out in his excitement and delight \u2014 playing such a merry game of blind-man's-buff as she had never seen surpassed in the light-hearted old days at Berry. And the game was not set a-going and kept up by thoughtless babies and reckless boys and girls mainly, but by mature officers in faded uniform, limping on one knee like Horatius Codes, or minus one arm like Horatio Lord Nelson.

CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE ; BABY PRISONERS. \"Din some awful retribution for undreamt-of crimes pursue the poor prisoners?\" Bessie asked herself, aghast, when one morning she felt the solid earth rock under her feet. Luckily she was not on the roof, where she usually took Dodo the first thing for an airing, and the child was playing on the floor beside her. She caught him up, and ran with the other terrified inhabitants of the fort into the court- yard, where for some moments nothing was to be heard or seen but the crash of beams, the fall of masonry, the cries of terror on all sides, and the clouds of dust which rose like smoke and threatened to add darkness to the other disasters. When the shock subsided it was known that one of the most severe earthquakes experienced for years in that region had caused the fortress to totter to its founda tions. Roofs of rooms and stairs had fallen. Lady R 2"], [256, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 244 Sale had been in imminent danger, which that daunt less woman had surmounted happily, as she had over come worse perils. General Elphinstone, lying sick and helpless, had only been saved by one of the soldiers. They freely forgave and loved him dearly to the last, and a private rushed in and snatched the feeble old leader from destruction. For days and nights slighter shocks of the earth quake were repeated in continual succession. Some times the rocking ofthe earth gave the impression of a heavy body rolling and rattling overhead ; some times the ground swayed from side to side, or heaved up and down like a ship in a storm. Bessie was re minded of the motion ofthe vessel in the gales which it had encountered in her three months' voyage from England, that seemed so long past, it was as if it had happened to her in another life. Indeed, the parallel was further illustrated by poor little Dodo in the middle of his fright becoming as sick as if he had been crossing an ocean. During all these days and nights hardly anybody dared venture into the fort, with its toppling-over towers and cracked and rent archways and walls. Mattresses and rugs were spread for those who could sleep in the court-yard ; but the night dews drenched the impromptu beds, in spite of the awning hung over them, and it was as if the sleepers had forded another river."], [257, "CYRUS BURIED LN THE EARTHQUAKE. 245 The mercy was that no life had been lost. Sud denly one cherished friend was missed, and Dodo, fast growing too manly to cry7, stuck his clenched fists into his eyes, and writhed in the effort to keep back the tears which he was ceasing to shed for any personal privation. Cy7rus was not to be found. He had been last seen watching an Afghan mouse's hole in one of the rooms, the roof of which had fallen in ten minutes later. Bessie and Lizzie gazed mourn fully at the pile of rubbish beneath which Cyrus' flat tened body was supposed to lie. As the girls gazed the very ghost of a mew, like the shadowy song of the departed Molly Malone crying \" Cockles, mussels ! \" along her old familiar beat in Dublin streets, broke upon the listeners' en raptured ears. \" Oh, he is alive ! dear, brave old Tom ! \" cried Lizzie, turning and hugging Bessie in her relief and joy. The next moment she was rushing away to get help, while Bessie and Dodo were frantically scraping with their fingers at the debris. One of the few re maining saices did the work of excavation more effec tually. Cyrus with his seven lives was dug out, showing no further injury than a scratch on his nose and a great deal of dirt in his coat. For the rest of the day he submitted graciously to be clasped pas sionately to the little breast in which he had helped"], [258, "246 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. to keep the spark of life during the tremendous ex perience ofthe Koord-Cabul Pass. Every-day life was going on, and even the sweet summer coming, in the midst of all the turmoil. English officers, who were permitted to go in the company of their guards beyond the walls of the sort, brought in bouquets of the fragrant flower of the narcissus to cheer the weary eyes of those who could not see so much as \" a blade of grass.\" These nar cissus flowers were like the carnation blossoms which compassionate gendarmes gave to Marie Antoinette as she lay in the narrow cell of the conciergerie. But even purer, sweeter, more engrossing visitants came to the sad women. Several babies were born to their mothers in their durance, and by a curious coincidence all the new comers were daughters. Oh, the mingled grief and joy, the forlorn bliss of clasping these unconscious infants who had come to share their mothers' captivity7 and peril ! And some of the little ones were as the last tokens from dead fathers to widows who were poor and yet rich. One morning Lizzie awoke Bessie, presenting a face lit up with tremulous thankfulness. The conse quence was that her friend started from a dream, crying out on the impulse ofthe moment, \"What is it, Lizzie? Has Kitten come back? \" \" No, no,\" answered Lizzie, a shade coming over he good-humoured, shrewd face, which an instant"], [259, "CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. 247 before had beamed wdth affectionate gratitude. \" But mamma has got a new baby7 to take Kitten's place, and to console her for her losses.

What between taking care of him, nursing mamma, and minding all of y7ou, I can tell you I shall have enough to do. Yes, you'll help me, I know you will, dear. But, oh, wasn't God good not to send baby till we were all at Budeeabad ! It is a little girl, Bessie, and I think it will be called 'Joseph ine,' after poor papa, who is not here to welcome his namesake.\" For the next fortnight the great marvel of the universe to the girls was this wonderful baby. They were so full of it that even Bessie had little attention to spare for anything else. Dodo suffered an eclipse, under which he was generous enough, though some what shy of the object of worship, to join the circle of ardent adorers of the last arrival among the pri soners. There had been talk of a ransom being asked and given for the captives, but the negotiations had fallen to the ground. There was hard fighting at Jellalabad between friends and foes, with the advantages and losses grossly exaggerated as they were bandied about by rumour. Success or failure was given now"], [260, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 248 to the Afghans, and now to the English ; so that the one day it was said the fort was taken by the enemy, and all hope of relief from that quarter was at an end, and the next that \" Fighting Bob \" had repulsed every assailant, and was on his march to deliver his countrywomen. One thing was certain, that Akbar Khan, leading the siege against Jellalabad, had been accidentally wounded by a follower, and was chafing \"like a lion taken in the toils.\" This increased a painful peculiarity ofthe situation which came to be dimly recognised by the shallowest woman and the simplest girl. Whether the English gained or lost, danger threatened the prisoners. In the first case, it was too probable that the vindictive Afghans would promptly revenge on the helpless, while yet in their power, the injuries inflicted by Queen Victoria's soldiers. In the second, the cap tives were left indefinitely a prey to the murderous robber tribes. There were two days of awed sus pense after it was distinctly known that Sir Robert Sale had gained a notable victory over Akbar, while neither the English general nor his conquer ing army appeared upon the scene. An ominous stillness prevailed in the fort at Budeeabad, where even the men among the captives had long ago been disarmed, and stood defenceless among the guns and knives of their sullen captors."], [261, "CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. 249 At sunset of the second day a reaction took place on the arrival of Dost Mahommed Khan, a trusted representative of Akbar's, with a large retinue. The new-comer was perfectly cool and friendly, went among the English, even shook hands all round, touched lightly on the battle before Jellalabad, and merely mentioned by the way that the prisoners whom he was so politely treating as guests were to leave their quarters the following morning and move on \u2014 he did not say where. The sole breach in the good mariners of this courteous chief was that he paid a special visit to Lady Macnaghten, asked that the unfortunate lady's boxes should be opened before him, and helped him self liberally to what remained of her jewels and shawls. As for Lady Sale, she had no such treasures, the care of which might have encumbered her. She re corded with grim glee that the sole contents left behind in the chest of drawers which her husband had sent over from Jellalabad were a bottle of nitric acid and another of lunar caustic. The endless marching of the Englishwomen and officers on the strings of mounted horses and laden camels, in the middle of fifty armed Afghans, began again. It had hardly recommenced when a false report sent the bewildered prisoners back to their dismantled rooms ; but the detention did not last more than a night."], [262, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 250 When the journey was resumed, as long as the green valley in which the fort was situated lasted there was a pleasant substitute for the last winter's snow. Field-peas were already in blossom in the fields, while dear English crane's-bill geraniums, for get-me-nots, and campions grew by the way-side. \" Oh, Sissy, let me get out and pick the pretty flowers,\" cried Dodo, the first time he saw them. \" No, Dodo,\" refused Bessie, with a touch of un conscious despair. \" These are not for you ; these are for happy children in England. Perhaps when we halt we may find some of the pretty stones you played with last night,\" alluding to the camels' bones Dodo had come across. On the second day the travellers came up with Akbar Khan and some of his troops. The Afghan prince was seated in his palanquin, looking haggard from his wound and moody from his defeat, as the cavalcade passed, and each of its members saluted him punctiliously. Soon the smiling valley was left behind, and sands and rocks formed the landscape. The heat from the sun's glare became almost as oppressive as the cold of winter had been three months before. Water was scarce, provisions failed, so that sometimes a few almonds and raisins were the only refreshments to be had. It was in vain that urgent remonstrances were ventured on by some of the English gentlemen to"], [263, "CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. 251 Akbar Khan, founded on the plea that his father, Dost Mahommed, with his wives, held by the Eng lish in Hindostan, were not only treated with all humanity and consideration, they had even royal state maintained for them. The blossoming trees on the hill-sides, the tulips and irises by the rivers, became like a mockery of the increasing privations and the sadness of the circum stances under which the travellers journeyed to an unknown bourne. Always, as on the former march, Akbar and his body-guard were cither in front or behind the part)-, passing and repassing them with his inscrutable dark smile and stately bow ; only coming up w7ith them to marshal the rafts on which the familiar Cabul river, twenty feet deep, was crossed. Lady Macnaghten, and even Lady Sale, fell ill of fever, and it was known that General Elphinstonc was borne along in a dying condition. Akbar made light of his wound, mounted his horse, and gave up his palanquin to the widow of the man he had slain. Rain and sunshine succeeded each other, alternately drenching and scorching the unwilling company, that had gleaned no more knowledge of their destination than was summed up in the distressing consciousness that they were being carried further and further from their friends and from the hope of rescue. Eventually Tezcen was reached. After a brief"], [264, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 252 halt General Elphinstone and several other invalids among the officers were left behind, while the ladies and children and the remaining officers were taken up among the hills, past ice and snow once more. At Tezeen the poor old General breathed his last. He was delivered from his misery and from the final weakness and extremity of suffering which he had borne with the silent, pathetic courage and patience of a high-minded and brave English gentleman and Christian soldier who had been fatally misled and overborne. Here at least he was not conquered. No indignity was shown by Akbar to the lifeless body ; it was sent with all outward respect, accompanied by the General's faithful servant and an Afghan guard, to the English garrison at Jellalabad, and though it was intercepted by lawless rovers, it was recovered and conveyed decently to the camp of Sir Robert Sale, where it was buried with sacred rites and military honours. At Zandah the captives rested for a month, and were fairly well treated. Fresh distributions of chintz and cloth were made. Tea, cheese, and sugar-candy were added to the other fare. Native ladies of rank in the fort exchanged visits with Lady Macnaghten and Lady Sale. It was all quite grand, Lizzie told Bessie, and not very uncomfortable, if people could only make up their minds to the situation. By7 the end of May the English ladies and gen-"], [265, "CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. 253 tlemen were glad to exchange the close dark rooms of the fort for arbours of juniper temporarily7 erected in the court-yard, chiefly by the prisoners' ingenuity and activity. These arbours were greatly delighted in by the children and the two girls, who were reminded of the Jews' Feast of Tabernacles. At the same time the early summer weather up among the hills was so variable, that the water was still sometimes frozen in the bhestees' goat-skins, and the air felt so keen that the fresh charm of a gipsy fire kindled in one corner had to be added to the other attractions of each odoriferous tent. It was when the Constables and Olivers were occupying one of these bowsers on a May afternoon, that a singular apparition presented itself in the door way. A little girl stood hovering in the entrance. .She wore the dress of the native children \u2014 a white muslin scarf wound round her body so as to make a petticoat, and brought over her head like a veil, which was now thrown back ; and she had the gay slippers which are displayed on holidays. Her skin was darker even than the brown Afghan complexion, so that she must have been exceedingly tanned, and she was grinning from ear to ear. For a moment the occupants ofthe juniper arbour sat transfixed, staring at the small stranger. Then a cry was heard so shrill, so wild that it could not have been more ear piercing, with a greater thrill of mingled joy and"], [266, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH 254 terror, though the person who uttered the cry had seen the loved dead raised to life again in her presence. It was not a scared child who screamed. Dodo was clutching Bessie's gown, open-mouthed but dumb. It was not a superstitious native \u2014 none was by7. It was strong, self-restrained Mrs. Constable, who grasped her baby and -gave that single shriek which would soon bring a score of people from the adjoining booths and from the fort to see what was the matter. In another instant she explained herself. She handed the baby quickly to Lizzie, and she literally fell upon the intruder. \" Oh, Kitten, Kitten,\" she sobbed, as she gathered the recovered child in her arms, \" where have you been ? Why7 did you stray7 that miserable night? Who has sent you back to me in this guise ? \" Truly the adventures of all the Olivers and Con stables put together had been as nothing compared to the romantic experiences of Kitten. The other children might tell after they were grey-headed men and women that they had been in the terrible retreat through the Khybur Pass, and had lingered many months in the fastnesses of Akbar Khan and his robber crew. But Kitten, when she was a sedate English matron, could recount yet more extraor dinary stories of the days of her youth. She had been borne back to Cabul among the hordes of fierce"], [267, "CYRUS BURIED IN THE EARTHQUAKE. 255 Afghans, when every murderer's hand was turned against his brother. She had been put on a horse before a khan, who rode up and down the streets with her, and offered her publicly7 for sale at the price of 3,000 rupees. She had actually- been bought as a slave by a merchant who had formerly been on friendly terms with the English, and kept by him till he could restore her to her friends. Another odd fact was that Kitten, who had not only been preserved alive, fed, and clothed by her captors, but had been petted and spoiled by the native family7 in which she had dwelt for five months, had conceived a violent attachment to the Afghans. She stamped and stormed when any word which she could understand was spoken in their disfavour. She was for a long time ready to make overtures of friend ship, in the smattering of an Afghan dialect she had glibly7 picked up, to every new native she came across. She threatened to scratch Dodo, if the truth must be told, when he said, with the candour of childhood, that her veil and shoes were not pretty, that she did not look nice in them \u2014 he hated them, and he asked her when was she going to leave them off, wash her face, and show her old carroty locks again ? But the eclipse ofthe regard between the little comrades was short-lived, while Kitten became naturally by far the most popular Missy Baba in the fort."], [268, "256 CHAPTER VIII. DELIVERANCE AND A FATHER'S ARMS. From Zandah the prisoners were taken back to within three miles of their old homes in Cabul, and lodged in a sort in the Loghur river. The severity of their captivity was greatly softened. They were allowed to communicate with the town which they knew so well, to borrow money from old allies, to buy necessaries, even to receive visits from friendly residents. No farther attempt was made to keep from the prisoners all information of the state of public affairs. Bessie could write to Jellalabad and have an answer from her father. She could even write to England to relieve the consternation and lengthened agony of suspense of the old couple at Berry. Yet war was still raging. A usurper occupied the uneasy throne of Shah Soojah, who had been long ago murdered in his turn, with his body stripped of its royal robes and cast in contempt into a ditch."], [269, "DELIVERANCE AND A FATHER'S ARMS. 257 Akbar Khan w7as fighting to overthrow the usurper and gain possession of the palace and citadel, as he had fought against the English six months before. The sound of the fighting was heard as far off as the fort on the Loghur river, and must have struck the listeners almost like one of the old familiar noises of Cabul. The valley was smiling with ripe barley and wheat, and the captives had their own harvest of fruit and flowers in the large garden of the fort. The garden, jealously guarded, was nevertheless given to the English as an exercise-ground, and for a little money7 they were allowed to buy a right to its produce. The pleasure and refreshment of it, and of bathing in the neighbouring river ! The gratification was great in commonest plant, bird, and insect. The bloom returned to the children's cheeks, for Afghanistan is not Hindostan, as they played in happy freedom, regardless of the rows of gaolers. Even Cyrus was found chasing butterflies. Bessie and Lizzie felt a revival of their early grown-up importance and house wifely pride when they divided the mulberries and grapes among the children, gathered plums and apricots for dessert, and filled baskets full of roses for sherbet. But as the summer wore on fever broke out in the fort. More than one little child and grown-up man and woman fell victims to its ravages. Autumn was s"], [270, "258 IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. approaching, the horrors of winter loomed at no great distance. The sickness of hope deferred grew worse and worse. On every side English successes were announced. It was like an age since Pollock had come to the relief of Sale, after Sale had relieved himself by boldly marching out of Jellalabad, and with his brave garrison defeating Akbar Khan, so that his brother general, in place of finding a beleaguered host at the last extremity, was met in triumph by a victorious little army, the band playing with good-humoured satire, \" Oh, but ye've been long o' coming.\" Pollock and Nott were advancing on Cabul from different directions, but the prisoners were prisoners still. It appeared as if England was leaving them to their melancholy fate instead of being moved like one man to deliver them. There continued to be talk with bated breath of the dreary and loathsome dungeons of Bokhara \u2014 where indeed Conolly and Stoddart were doomed to perish, or of wretched lives dragged out among barbarous tribes in inaccessible wilds. On the 25th of August, three months after the prisoners had arrived at the fort by the river, when Nott and Pollock were drawing daily nearer to the doomed capital, the captive company were informed that they must start on a new journey towards the Hindoo Koosh mountains. Once more the camels and horses were drawn out, with a strong body-guard of 300 Afghans, and in the"], [271, "DELIVERAATCE AND A FATHER'S ARMS. 259 middle of the night the train of people wound along the road, leaving only the dead in their graves and those who were too sick to move, behind them. The travellers were hurried on for nine days, with little rest, over stony paths which the camels could not climb, so that only the hardy, sure-footed ponies could carry7 their giddy7 riders up the steep roads. The cavalcade traversed high mountain passes, from valley to valley where the corn wras yet but in the ear and the hay in the cock from fort to fort, from tent to tent, the sun beating on the devoted heads by day, the frost smiting them by night in these lofty latitudes. But the primitive people forming the scanty inhabit ants of the country, especially those of Kuzzilbash descent, were more commiserating than hostile. Bessie would never forget the amiable behaviour of one long-bearded khan, who, as his fort was passed, brought out trays of cakes and sweetmeats, and pressed them on the weary ladies and hungry children. At last Bameean, the destination of the wayfarers, was reached. It was situated among desolate heights, where the chief vegetation consisted of prickly furze and tamarisk bushes. The remote fort furnished only the rude accommodation of what were in effect dark cattle-sheds built round the square. But the renewed privations were cheerfully borne when it became whispered that they were only a prelude to escape, s 2"], [272, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH. 260 and that the little party would soon have their fate in their own hands. The captain of the 300 Afghans was a soldier of fortune, good-natured, vain, and greedy. He had already been a deserter from the sepoy army, and he was prepared, on sufficient inducement, and with the knowledge that the star of the English was again in the ascendant, while that of his master Akbar was paling before it, to desert once more. Kitten Constable was the first to make up to him, and seeing how he played with the child, an English officer, acquainted with Saleh Mahommed's language, rode with him, listened to his gasconading stories, sounded his dubious honesty, and at length broadly hinted at a large reward and a certain pension if the native soldier, in place of carrying the captives still further among the wilds as he was commanded, would accompany his charge back to one of the English camps. Saleh listened, weighed the glittering bait and the peril incurred in swallowing it, and yielded. Four English officers swore by their God and Saviour to keep the terms. A regular agreement was drawn up, written in Persian, and signed by every man and woman there, binding themselves to make good from their private resources, if the authorities failed to supply the sum, the ransom and pension to the traitor. Bessie Oliver and Lizzie Constable's names might be found appended to the document \u2014 Bessie as represent-"], [273, "DELIVERANCE AND A FATHER'S ARMS. 261 ing her father, Lizzie as supporting her widowed mother. \" Bessie,\" whispered Lizzie breathlessly, after she had written her name with great solemnity, \" do you really think we'll ever \" \" Be quiet, Lizzie.\" Bessie stopped her with a trembling lip. \" I cannot bear to speak about it. I dreamt last night of England and Berry.\" A rebellion was openly proclaimed at Bameean, the flag of the rebels hoisted, contributions levied, and submission required from the neighbouring chiefs. As the first step the fort was to be prepared for defence. Provisions were laid in, and wells dug under the instructions of the English officers, who had turned the tables on their adversary. Like Sale, the prisoners had delivered themselves ; and under the circum stances it was pardonable enough that the deliverance should be wrought by7 guile and not by force. Then a solitary horseman brought the joyful intelligence that Akbar Khan had been utterly routed by General Pollock, and had fled into an obscurity which closed over him, while the General was within a day's march of Cabul, to which the freed prisoners resolved to go at once. On the 1 6th of September the party started on their return journey, heroic Lady Sale seeking to pique the servants who remained cowed, by offering to carry a musket and lead them. The first night the company"], [274, "IN THE CANNON'S MOUTH 262 slept in the cold moonlight on earthern beds. But little cared even the children, sharing in the exhilara tion of their elders, when the morning brought more good news \u2014 the welcome announcement that an English officer, Sir Richmond Shakespear, was on his way with a body of 600 friendly Kuzzilbashes to guard the ladies and the little ones from recapture. There were five days yet of hard travel, willingly faced because of the different direction of the horses' heads, and the changed hearts in the breasts of the riders since they had recently trod the same rough road. Two alarms, happily dissipated, were met and surmounted on the way. Twice a cloud of dust with straggling horsemen in the van, betokening the march of bodies of armed men, appeared in front of the travellers. The new-comers might be friend or foe \u25a0 \u2014 pushing on to help, or pressing forward in a desperate effort to seize again the prey just escaping them. On each occasion a halt was called, a fighting line formed ; every musket was loaded, every heart beat high. But first it was Shakespear and his Kuzzilbashes, and next \u2014 oh, happiness beyond de scription ! \u2014 it was Sale himself, who had been celebrating his sixtieth birthday, and arrived in time to receive his wife and daughter's congratulations, and to congratulate them in turn how heartily ! \" Fighting Bob \" with his fighters had come \u2014 among them"], [275, "DELIVERANCE A AD A FATHER'S ARMS. 263 Captain Oliver, sick with yearning to kiss his mother less children, to say, \" Well done \" to Bessie, and ask Dodo how Cyrus fared after his wanderings. He did it to the roar of a royal salute from the English cannon, in honour of the arrival of the wife and daughter of the General. Little remains to be told. The Olivers and Constables paid a flying visit with the soldiers to wrecked Cabul, to look at the ruins of their houses and the graves of their dead, to see another puppet king established on the throne of Shah Soojah, and to watch the destruction of the great bazaar where Sir William Macnaghten's body had been exposed, as a lesson that England will not be outraged with impunity. Then along with the army the two families evacuated Afghanistan. In the course of their future history neither Bessie Oliver and Lizzie Constable, nor Dodo and Kitten, ever forgot that portion of their lives \u2014 over nine months, spent virtually in the cannon's mouth. The bond of friendship between the two girls and the two households, which was sealed by the tribulation endured together, never relaxed, it was only drawn tighter as the years grew and waned.

Containing an Account, with Copious Coloured and Photographic Illustrations (the latter here produced for the first time), of the Corals and Coral Reefs, Pearl and Pearl Shell, Beche-de-Mer, other Fishing Industries, and the Marine Fauna of the Australian Great Barrier Region. By W. Saville-Kent, F.L.S., F.Z.S., F.I.Inst., &c. The Great Barrier Reef of Australia, represented by a vast rampart of coral origin, extending for no less a length than twelve hundred miles from Torres Straits to Lady Elliot Island on the Queensland coast, takes rank among the most notable of the existing wonders of the world. Built up by the direct and indirect agency of soft-fleshed polyps of multitudinous form and colour, it encloses betwixt its outer border and the adjacent mainland a tranquil ocean highway for vessels of the heaviest draught. To the naturalist, and more particularly to the marine biologist, the entire Barrier area is a perfect Eldorado, its prolific waters teeming with animal organisms of myriad form and hue representative of every marine zoological group. The author's qualifications for the task he undertakes are emphasised through the circumstance of his having been occupied for the past eight years as Inspector and Commissioner of Fisheries to various of the Australian Colonies, the three later years having been devoted more exclusively to investigating and reporting to the Queensland Government upon the fishery products of the Great Barrier District. A prominent feature in this work will consist of photographic views of coral reefs of various construction and from diverse selected localities, together with similar and also coloured illustrations and descriptions of the living corolla, coral-polyps, and other marine organisms commonly associated on the reefs. These photographic illustrations taken by the author are, from both a scientific and an artistic standpoint, of high intrinsic merit and also unique in character, representing, in point of fact, the first occasion on which the camera has been employed for the systematic delineation of these subjects. Subscribers names are now being registered for this important work. London: 13, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall, S.W."], [305, "W. H.

The Secretary of State for India has had under his consideration the issue of a complete account of our Indian possessions brought down to the census of 1891. The two standard works on the subject are Sir William Hunter's \" Imperial Gazetteer of India \" and \" The Indian Empire \" by the same author. The \" Imperial Gazetteer \" embodies in 14 volumes the leading results of the great statistical survey of India, while \" The Indian Empire \" condenses the whole into one thick volume. Both these works are now out of date, as their administrative, commercial, and social economic chapters only come down to 1 871 and 188 1, and \"The Indian Empire \" has for some time been also out of print. The Secretary of State has determined to postpone the revision of the larger work until the next Indian census of 1901, when it will form a great and permanent account of the condition and progress of India at the close of the 19th century. Meanwhile he has authorised the issue of a thoroughly revised edition of \"The Indian Empire,\" and placed the necessary materials and assistance at Sir William Hunter's disposal, to enable him to carry out the work. Ihe book, which has for some time been under preparation, will form a complete but compact account of India, its peoples, history, and products, the revision being based on the administration reports ofthe 12 provinces of British India and the feuda tory States for 1891. New and valuable matter has been incorporated in each division of the work, and important sections have been added. The parts which deal with the population and races of India have been reconstructed on the returns of the Indian census of 1891, and the whole of the administrative, commercial, and economic chapters have been brought up to the same date. The historical section, occupying several hundred pages, has been revised, and in part re-written, by the light of recent researches into Hindo and Mahometan history, and from the new materials afforded by the official publication of the Indian records, under the able editorship of Mr. Forrest and others. The publication of the work, which will make a large volume of about Soo pages, has been en trusted to Messrs. W. H. Allen S: Co., who hope to be able to issue it in the Spring of 1893.
