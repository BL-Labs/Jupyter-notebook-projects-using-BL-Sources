While Jasper Davenport and Mr. Vincent Greybridge were collecting the (to them) unnecessary proofs of Lord Brackelonde's guilt in London, and Richard Clynborough and Mr. Walter Greybridge were elaborating their plans at Stancoombe, Lady Mary and her step-mother had already settled their line of action. The former was acting on the assumption that nothing could avert the crash as foreshadowed by her uncle to her in the interview which had been prolonged to the small hours of that morning. Outwardly, however, there was not the slightest change in the even tenor of the domestic arrange- VOL. II. b"], [10, "The Mystery of the 2 ments at Brackelonde Dene, and the apparent calmness of the two women would have deceived the most acute observer, even if he (the observer) had had a suspicion of the fate overhanging the family. Nay, it would have surprised the most initiated, such as the Stancoombe banker and Richard Clynborough themselves. The semblance of repose was altogether due to Lady Mary's masterly survey of the situation, her indomitable strength of mind, and her prompt decision as to dealing with the successive crises she knew to be impending ; for even before her uncle left her side she felt certain that he had exaggerated nothing ; that, to use Daven port's own words, only a miracle could save her father. In order to make this perfectly clear to her, the banker had been compelled to tell her that part of the story of her mother's life which was connected with James Drayton and the role her father had played. There was no help for it, and the revelation did not materially increase the daughter's contempt for her sire. It only had the effect"], [11, "Patrician Club. 3 of removing the broken reed she was still inclined to lean upon at the beginning of the interview, by showing her that her idea of bribing the detectives into procrastination and thus enabling her father to escape was im possible of realization. \" Not all the money you and I possess will buy Davenport's com plicity in such a scheme,\" the banker had said. \" A miracle, and a miracle only, can save your father from a felon's death.\" The words had practically shut the door upon all further hope in any direction, for Lady Mary was too practical and too rational to expect a miracle in favour of anyone. Though abso lutely indifferent to money, she had been heard to say more than once \" that the only wonder-working power in our days was hard cash,\" and that power would be of no avail in this instance. She knew her uncle too well to suspect him for an instant of shrinking from any pecuniary sacrifice, however great, for her sake, if not for his own. Nevertheless, after sitting quite still for a little while, she virtually clutched at a last B 2"], [12, "The Mystery of the 4 straw. \" Uncle,\" she asked, \" am I at all like what my mother was when she was my age ? \" \" Mentally and morally you are a good deal like her,\" said the banker, \" but phy sically there is little or no likeness.\" Lady Mary looked disappointed. The banker at once guessed the cause of the disappointment. \" The likeness, had it been there, Mary, would have availed nothing,\" he remarked, \" for I suppose you intended to use it as a passport to James Drayton's heart. I doubt whether it would not have defeated its own purpose. Painful as it must be to hear such a thing, you must remember that Drayton had just cause for resentment against your dead mother. She believed, or, what was worse, pretended to believe, the accusation against him. You must dismiss all idea of personal appeal to James Drayton, who, take my word for it, is at this hour no longer the sole arbiter of the situation. We are virtually handbound, and dare not venture on the least inquiry, or we should find that his visit"], [13, "Patrician Club. 5 to Stancoombe was not for the sole purpose of seeing his cousin and me. Depend upon it, your father is already being watched. Our attempt to obtain information on that point would almost amount to circumstantial evidence against him. We cannot stir without arousing suspicion.\" \" I am afraid we cannot,\" assented the girl. \" As it is, I do not know whom to trust and whom to mistrust in this house, and at this moment I am in terror lest Lady Bracke londe should suddenly wake or talk in her sleep. One thing is very certain \u2014 something will have to be done before or when the effect of the chloral has worn off, for unless we can give her the assurance that Captain Edmunds bury's life is not in danger she will become delirious, and, strong as I am, I should not be able to manage her by myself. I feel as if the place were undermined, and that the slightest word from her will bring on the explosion. I am speaking figuratively ; I wish I were not. A literal denouement of the kind would be a welcome relief. Yes, you"], [14, "6 The Mystery of the are right, uncle,\" she went on, in response to a look of reproach from the banker ; \" it's no good making things worse by giving way, but the burden is somewhat heavy for my young shoulders.\" After that one cry of revolt, she calmly faced the situation. The first thing imposed upon her was to get Lady Brackelonde into a thoroughly calm frame of mind. The diffi culty was not so great as Lady Mary had an ticipated. For more than half an hour after she awoke on that morning Lady Bracke londe lay quite still, apparently insensible to anything but the soothing effects of a good night's rest. The maid had been sent away, and Lady Mary herself was attending to her step-mother's bodily comforts, watching the latter's face as she slowly and noiselessly moved about the room. Gradually she saw the last fumes of the narcotic disappear and the brain resume its functions. The horrible thoughts of the previous day were endeavour ing to reassert their sway. But before they could fairly effect an entrance Lady Mary"], [15, "Patrician Club. 7 executed a daring charge on their very centre. \" Mama, dear,\" she said, arranging Lady Brackelonde's pillows while she handed her a cup of tea, \" they have found the murderer of that waiter.\" The cup stopped midway to its destination, and was given back to Lady Mary for a second or so. But there was a sigh of relief, and a smile played on Lady Brackelonde's lips which boded well for the young girl's success. She, however, felt that she would have to advance very cautiously. \" Who is it ? \" asked Lady Brackelonde. \" The police refuse to publish his name until they have arrested him,\" said Lady Mary, almost at random ; for though she had laid her general plans, she had been unable to frame answers to questions the shape of which she could not foresee. But she noticed that she had gained one important point, inas much as the few sentences had had the effect of changing Lady Brackelonde's mental atti tude with regard to the drama ; from being"], [16, "The Mystery of the 8 an anguish-tossed actress in the same she had suddenly become a mere spectator \u2014 a spectator still keenly interested, but a spec tator for all that. \" I suppose it's in the papers?\" \"Yes,\" said Lady Mary, without a moment's hesitation. She felt perfectly safe in her answer, for, young as she was, she knew from experience that a sentence of that kind always finds its way into print whenever the police are utterly at sea with regard to the whereabouts or identity of a great criminal. Suddenly Lady Brackelonde's countenance fell, a puzzled expression came over the face, and Lady Mary knew that the expression would shape itself into a question difficult to answer. But she stood waiting resolutely. \" I cannot make out,\" said Lady Bracke londe, softly and to herself as it were, \"why he should have accused Jack of that murder.\" Then she paused once more, evidently trying to collect her thoughts. Lady Mary did not move ; she was glad even of the short respite,"], [17, "Patrician Club. 9 which enabled her to prepare her answer. At last Lady Brackelonde went on : \"I re member he said that lack had been cheating at cards, that Gustave Dubois was his con federate, and that he wanted him out of the way before the Club Committee holds its inquiry. Lady Mary felt desperate. Should she tell her step-mother everything, and risk the shock the terrible revelation would produce ? For a moment she intently scanned the wan face lying back on the pillow. No, the risk was too great. Then she reverted to the plan she had conceived before the ghastly truth was known to her, to the plan that had presented itself to her on the previous after noon when her uncle had merely invited her to accompany him abroad, and to induce her step-mother to join them. \" Mama, dear,\" she said, drawing near to the bed, and placing her hand on Lady Bracke londe's cheek, \" Mama, dear, is it not better that we should put the masks aside we have been wearing for some time, the masks that"], [18, "The Mystery of the 10 have not prevented our seeing how unhappy we both are here ? This story of cheating at cards and murder is a mere invention of my father to make us still more wretched. He is cruel at heart, and I for one have made up my mind not only to leave the Dene, but England altogether. I told my uncle of this a fortnight ago\" \u2014 Lady Mary invented as she was proceeding \u2014 \"and asked him to make arrangements to that effect. He says that he himself wants rest, recreation, and change of air, and proposes to winter on the Riviera. We start on Tuesday or Wednesday. That's what he came to tell me yesterday. He is anxious that you should join us. I mentioned his wish to my father before he left for London last night. He said neither yes nor no, but I feel certain he will make no difficulties. So we will go and be at peace. My uncle will be here to-night, and we will give him our answer.\" Lady Mary stopped to watch the effect of her words. She knew that eventually she would have to think and act for both ; never-"], [19, "Patrician Club. 11 theless she wished to ascertain the impression produced by the proposal. She was thoroughly aware of the difference in character between her step-mother. and herself. She foresaw that if left to her own devices, Lady Brackelonde would go on suffering sooner than venture upon the slightest step that might be con- strued by her world \u2014 a narrow one, indeed \u2014 into the faintest semblance of a scandal. Everyone for miles around knew that the wife of Lord Brackelonde was in many respects worse off than the convict at Port- land or Chatham ; yet an attempt on her part to free herself from her bondage, even temporarily, by a journey abroad in the com- pany of her step-daughter would be scouted by county society as a distinct offence against the laws of good breeding, while the husband could have departed for a two or three or four years' trip on his yacht or on a voyage to India without his conduct being so much as questioned. Lady Brackelonde, charming, refined, educated as she might be, was not sufficiently strong to set at nought the articles"], [20, "The Mystery of the 12 of the social creed she had imbibed with the mother's milk, as it were. Lady Mary knew all this. That was the reason why she watched and waited. She had not long to wait ; the answer came as she had foreseen. For a moment a glimmer of contentment came into Lady Brackelonde's eyes, but it faded almost as quickly. \" It would be very nice, Mary,\" she said ; \"but I am afraid it's impossible. It would set people talking.\" Before Lady Mary could advance the argument she held in reserve her step-mother went on : \" But, Mary, dear \" \" Yes, mama.\" \" Isn't this an entire reversal of your own hopes, I will not say plans ? \" \" I don't understand, mama.\" Lady Brackelonde took the hand resting on her cheek in hers and drew the young girl's head closer to her breast. \"What becomes of Richard in all this, Mary, to say nothing of your own prospect of happiness ? \" she asked."], [21, "Patrician Club. 13 The girl's eyes filled with tears. \" I know what becomes of my own,\" she said, with a weary sigh. \" I do not know what becomes of Dick's ; or, rather,\" correcting herself, \" I know but too well. I do not doubt Dick's affec tion for me, but his moral fear of my father outweighs it, and I cannot wonder at it, seeing that it seems a family complaint. The children shall suffer for the sins of the parents. I shall suffer in one way and per haps he in another, seeing that it is nothing less than a sin to hate a man as the Clyn boroughs hate my father.\" \" Blood is thicker than water after all,\" thought Lady Mary, after having uttered the last words, for in her inmost heart she felt that the hatred of the Clynboroughs was justified, and still she re sented it. \" But assuredly Dick has never said or hinted as much,\" protested Lady Bracke londe. \" That's true,\" assented Lady Mary, some what bitterly, in spite of herself, \" but I know full well that it is the only thing that has"], [22, "The Mystery of the 14 prevented him asking me to be his wife. If I were a man I'd be afraid of no man,\" she added, drawing herself up proudly. \" As it is I am afraid of no man.\" \" Yes, you are very brave, Mary,\" said Lady Brackelonde, with a faint smile. And \" \u2014 after a moment's hesitation \u2014 \" if you are brave enough to face your father with the direct proposal of my accompanying you and Mr. Greybridge abroad, and get his consent, I'll be brave enough for once not to trouble about the comments of the world and go with you.\" Lady Brackelonde's resolution had the effect of calming her spirits, so that during the remainder of the day she was able to discuss with a degree of equanimity, and even with a certain show of interest, the pre parations for the contemplated journey. The prospect of putting a long distance between herself and her husband, at any rate for several months, seemed to have lifted a weight from off her mind \u2014 a cheerful dis position of which Lady Mary was by no"], [23, "Patrician Club. 15 means slow to take advantage by suggesting that in order to avoid as much as possible the comments of surrounding society, Dr. Swanston should he made to declare that a prolonged stay abroad was absolutely necessary to the recovery of Lady Bracke londe's health. Lady Mary undertook to do the necessary spiriting with the physician, a by no means difficult task, as she was well aware. Outwardly as calm as Lady Bracke londe, she was inwardly a prey to intense anxiety. That the blow would inevitably fall she had not the shadow of a doubt. As has been shown already, her uncle's last words had been too categorical to leave her the faintest glimmer of hope in that respect. The main question for the present was how long the catastrophe would be delayed \u2014 she did not even say could, knowing how power less she was \u2014 and whether it would be delayed long enough to get Lady Brackelonde out of England. She kept repeating mentally that her presence could not alter the march of events by a hair's breadth, that whether she"], [24, "16 The Mystery of the went or stayed the best legal talent obtainable would be placed at the disposal of the accused, but that all the legal talent in the world would fail to secure an acquittal, so absolutely certain did she feel that the evidence which was being gathered while she was sitting there would be too overwhelming to leave a loophole of escape. And yet she looked upon her intended departure as an act of the basest cowardice. Neither pity nor affection prompted the reluctance to go. As she had told her uncle, she would scarcely have hesitated to kill her father ; and she would certainly have eagerly loaded the pistol and handed it to him to blow his brains out. Yet go she must unless she would run the risk of seeing an utterly innocent being turned into a raving lunatic. Mary fostered no illusions with regard to the feeling of Lady Brackelonde for her husband, but she also knew that if Esther's apprehension did not deprive her of her senses, the revelations at the subsequent trial, whether her father stood in the common dock at Newgate or at"], [25, "Patrician Club. 17 the bar of the House of Lords, would bring about that terrible result. The line of defence he would adopt was as plain to his daughter as if she had already heard it discussed by the lawyers entrusted with it. Her father would not be content to defend himself \u2014 of that she felt sure. The conviction that he was doomed would not prevent him from attempt ing to blast the reputation of his wife, to besmirch the honourable career of Captain Edmundsbury, by having the whole of the story of the card scandal repeated in court. In a case where his life was at stake his counsel could not very well decline to obey his instructions to the letter, and if one set from motives of professional dignity should decline to lend themselves to such dastardly tactics, another set would be found to pocket that professional dignity together with the enormous fees. She already beheld Lady Brackelonde and Captain Edmundsbury standing in the witness-box with the eyes of so-called \" smart society \" gloating over them, and those of the whole of England eagerly vol. 11. c"], [26, "18 The Mystery of the devouring the smallest scrap of evidence. Whatever the outcome of the trial might be, the final issue of the whole, as far as Lady Brackelonde was concerned, admitted of no speculation on Lady Mary's part ; it meant the death of her step-mother or her confine ment in a mad-house. Lady Mary was perhaps unconsciously influenced in her estimate of her step-mother's powers of mental endurance by the self-same considera tions which, according to Miss Caroline Drayton, had prompted Lord Velstrode to oppose might and main a marriage between his eldest daughter and her cousin. If closely and scientifically questioned, the girl would not have been able to point to a single act or word that might be construed into a proof of that incipient insanity from which the Edmunds bury family, and especially the younger mem bers, were suspected to suffer. And yet she felt that the suspicion was not unfounded, and that the slightest shock, let alone the one she saw impending, would have a fatal and irre trievable result ; and this she was determined"], [27, "Patrician Club. 19 to prevent at any cost. There was only one way of doing this, and she was prepared to do it. She would accept her uncle's suggestion. The process of reasoning by which she had arrived at this decision occupied many hours, during which the two women were seated in Lady Brackelonde's boudoir, dis cussing the preparations for the journey and occupied with some trifling needlework. Mr. Walter Greybridge, on leaving that morning, had expressed his intention of returning towards evening. If anything important occurred meanwhile his niece was to send word immediately. Lady Mary sat anxiously awaiting his coming, though outwardly calm. All at once Lady Brackelonde, who had been silent for some time, asked, \u2014 \" Do you intend to write to Dick before you go, Mary ? \" The question had struck the very train of thought Lady Mary was pursuing at that moment. ' Yes,\" she said, \" it's better to have a c 2"], [28, "The Mystery of the 20 clear understanding about our respective future positions ; though there is a difficulty about it,\" she added, with an attempt at a smile. \" You cannot very well tell a man who has never asked you to be his that you will not be his wife. It is the story of the milkmaid reversed, for Richard would have the right to say, ' Nobody asked you, miss.' Still, I'll write the letter all the same.\" \"It may settle your respective positions for the future,\" remarked Lady Brackelonde, in an interested tone ; \"but not in the way you expect, Mary. I fancy that if Richard Clynborough never asked you to be his wife it was because he took it for granted that you understood the meaning of his attentions. Your letter, however carefully worded, will convince him that he was right, but lest there should still be a doubt on your part he will speak out.\" Lady Mary shook her head. \" I do not think he will,\" she said. \" I imagine that, much as he cares for me, he may consider himself well out of it, if not for his own sake,"], [29, "Patrician Club. 21 then for that of his family, for there is no denying that both Lord and Lady Clovelly, though they have always treated me with the greatest kindness, would prefer a different connection for their son than that of the daughter of Lord Brackelonde. And Richard, albeit that he is the best of fellows, is largely influenced by his parents, especially by his mother. Take my word for it, mama, dear, that my father's accusation against Captain Edmundsbury, base, unfounded as it is, was not imparted to you only. And I need hardly tell you what such conduct with regard to his dear godson, whom he loves as his own children, would mean to Lord Clovelly, the soul and impersonation of honour.\" \" There is a great deal of truth in what you say, Mary. But what if, in spite of it all, Richard were to ask you to be his wife ? \" \" Make your mind easy on that score, mama.

Before the maid had ceased speaking Lady Mary stood bolt upright in the middle of the room. As a rule she was not given to show her emotion, but by this time the corners of her mouth twitched and the nostrils quivered visibly, for she instinctively guessed that the arrival of the two men foreboded not only a crisis affecting herself \u2014 at that moment she was profoundly indifferent to her own con- cerns \u2014 but a compulsory warning of the impending catastrophe to her step-mother which might be fraught with consequences she shuddered to contemplate. She guessed exactly what had happened.

Her pride abso lutely revolted at the idea. Intensely as she loved Richard, she felt almost inclined to resent his heroism, for in spite of her anger she could not help accounting it as such. She, like Richard, saw the isolation to which a marriage with her would condemn him ; and this magnificent specimen of womanhood, intelligent, tender, and devoted to a degree, shrank from the contemplation of it, not only for him, but, if the truth must be told, for herself. For the moment, though, the picture of the future which she conjured up for herself and Richard was thrown in the shadow by that which she beheld looming threateningly before her of her step-mother's fate in the event of untoward revelations of what was passing, and her apprehension was by no means de creased by the haunted look of Lady Bracke londe just before the maid's entrance. WThat"], [33, "Patrician Club. 25 was she to do ? To meet her uncle and Richard by herself would only make matters worse. Lady Brackelonde's suspicions would become all the stronger. To see the two men in her step-mother's presence was a risk she dared not face. Lady Brackelonde her self came providentially to the rescue. The haunted look had subsided and a faint smile taken its place. \" Richard is a noble creature,\" she said, \" and my prophecy has even proved more true than I expected. He did not want your letter to bring him to your side, and probably for ever. I feel sure he has come to ask you to be his wife.\" Lady Mary eagerly caught the straw unconsciously held out to her. \" Perhaps, mama, dear,\" she said, \" though I doubt it. But at any rate I had better see him alone first, and I will send my uncle up to keep you company. You can settle the further plans of our journey with him.\" And with out awaiting her step-mother's answer, Lady Mary left the room and went downstairs."], [34, "26 The Mystery of the Mr. Greybridge and Richard had been shown into the library, a usual thing for the servants to do when Lord Brackelonde was away from home. When the girl entered her visitors were seated opposite one another, silently, and one quick glance at them sufficed to show her that her surmises were correct \u2014 that Richard was there at the request of her uncle. The young fellow looked ghastly pale, and as he took her outstretched hand she felt the tremble in his. The girl felt in no mood for empty phrases. She expressed no surprise at his unforeseen call, but turned at once to the banker. \" I suppose, uncle, you have brought Richard here to speak to me ? \" she said ; and without waiting for Mr. Greybridge's reply, she went on : \" In that case, I'd better fight it out with Richard by myself, unless he is afraid of me ; and, honestly speaking, he looks as if he were.\" The latter words were spoken with an attempt at cheerfulness, which positively startled both men. But the"], [35, "Patrician Club. 27 elder was not his niece's dupe for longer than an instant. \"You are a very brave girl, Mary,\" he said, \" but even bravery may be untimely and out of place under such circumstances.

I wish you would go upstairs to her, while I talk to Richard, and discuss the plans of our journey with her.\" She had not taken her eyes off Richard's face, and at the last words she watched it still more keenly. If she had dared, she would have taken his pulse in her hand while she spoke them.

She had noticed that at the mention of the journey a faint flush had come into the pale cheeks of Richard Clyn borough and a glimmer of light into the hitherto sad eyes, and she construed the meaning of both in her own way. The construction only strengthened her resolution as to her course of action. \"But, Mary, my child,\" gently protested the banker, \" the journey may not be taken after all ; so what will be the use of talking it over with Lady Brackelonde ? \" \"Not be taken, uncle?\" repeated Mary, playing the hypocrite for once, as she knew very well what her uncle meant to convey. \" I thought the journey was decided on, subject to my consent.

Lady Mary's hostile tone in answer to her uncle's hints about a possible modification of their plans, added to her vehement remark that no conversation with Richard could affect the original intention, had grated upon his ears, and the disagreeable impression was uncon sciously intensified by his knowledge that Mary had detected the tell-tale flush in his face and the glimmer of hope in his eyes at the bare hint of that journey taking place after all.

Up till then she had had her doubts about Richard's strength of mind and character. The tone he had adopted for the last few moments had set these doubts at rest. In obedience to his wish she kept silent, but she felt inwardly pleased. \" I have come, Mary,\" Richard went on, \" to ask you to be my wife, and that with as little delay as possible, so that I may have the right to take you away before the blow falls.\" Mary simply shook her head. \" It cannot be, Dick,\" she said, holding out her hand to him, while the tears were coursing down her cheeks. \" It is written that the children shall suffer for the sins of the parents. There is no law, divine or human, which allows of the innocent not related to the"], [43, "Patrician Club. 35 criminal to take the consequences of his crime upon him. Modern life is not worked out upon the Greek dramatist's conception of inexorable fate. Time, that is supposed to heal all wounds, will be powerless to heal such a wound as that which will be inflicted on me ; it will go on festering till my dying day. I have no right to allow anyone to be tainted by contact with it, and least of all have I the right \" \u2014 and here a deep blush suffused her cheeks \u2014 \" to transmit it to my children. With regard to myself, I am resigned to be a social leper, but I am equally determined that no one else shall contract the loathsome taint from contact with me or through transmission. When I go there will be no possible germs left as far as I can help it, and the only consolation I will carry with me to the grave is that by a sacrifice, harder to bear perhaps than the disgrace itself, I may have succeeded in obtaining the divine pardon for my father's crime. But there will be at least the conviction that no children of mine can curse his memory.\" D 2"], [44, "36 The Mystery of the Mary's last words had struck a new chord in Richard's heart, and disclosed a new vista hitherto not thought of, let alone clearly perceived. His filial affection, panic-stricken at the blow he was about to inflict on his parents, had virtually barred his mind to the slightest thought of his possible paternity. The hope of maternity constitutes the basis of the true woman's ideal of marriage ; the desire for increase, even from the fairest creature, rarely presents itself to the man's imagination, in spite of Shakspere's assertion to the con trary. It is the foundation of the fabric of matrimony with the one, the ornamental frieze with the other ; hence the difference in the trains of thought of Mary and Richard. Nevertheless, when that train of thought had been started by Mary's allusion, Richard sat appalled, though not a muscle of his face betrayed the increased feeling of despair. On the contrary, he endeavoured to represent matters in a less sombre aspect. \" Let me remind you, Mary,\" he said, \" that terrible as your father's crime may be, men of his station"], [45, "Patrician Club. 37 have taken life before now and the stigma has not clung to their descendants.\" \" That's a bit of specious arguing, for which I thank you in my inmost heart, Dick, but it will not hold water for a moment. Men in his station have taken life before now, true ; but their crimes have never been prompted by such base, abominable, abso lutely degrading motives as his. We need not go over the whole of the story again, Dick, but you know as well as I do that, throughout the civilized world, the annals of crime never showed one darker or more foul, and that whosoever is in the remotest degree related to the author of it will be defiled by it for ever.\" \" But we can change our names, Mary, and change them so effectually as to defy detection.\" \" Can we change our faces or wear masks ? \" \" No, but we can go to some solitary spot in some far-distant country and begin a new life with the memory of the past buried, if not forgotten.\" \" My dear Dick, can you tell me of cne"], [46, "38 The Mystery of the solitary spot, in no matter how distant a country, where the English traveller does not penetrate ? But granted that we could find such a spot, do you think that I would con demn you to such a lifelong exile ? \" \" It would be no exile with you, Mary,\" replied Richard. And perhaps for the moment he meant what he said. \" Yes, it would, Dick. I am far less wedded to society than you are, and I am not ashamed to confess that my affection for you is as strong as yours for me, but it would be exile even to me. I would not consent to it for myself alone, not because it would kill me ; on the contrary, because it would probably give me a chance of becoming a centenarian, and I wish to avoid that at any cost. I know what you are going to say, and I'll knock that piece of specious reasoning on the head as I did the first. There have been men and woman with a history who have made homes for themselves in the New World and have been none the worse fcr it. They did not belong to your class \u2014 I do not"], [47, "Patrician Club. 39 say mine, for, after all, I am only une demoi selle de la bourgeoisie in spite of my title. Moreover, they were obliged to bestir them selves to live ; there will be no such necessity on our part. Our attempt to work will be a make-believe, especially to us, and however well it might impose on others it would never do so on ourselves. In the evening we should be alone with our memories \u2014 and regrets. These people, moreover, bore names in no way distinguished. You can't change yours as you have suggested. Noblesse oblige, and you have no right to change it, Dick. But there is something else, Dick ; and believe me that I have no wish to be a bird of ill-omen, but it would seem that when misfortune once fastens upon a family it does its work whole sale. Both St. Mavor and Basil are un married. What if through some terrible calamity, such as has often happened before, they were to meet with unforeseen death at the same time, leaving you heir to the title, nay, the title itself? Imagine our return to the London world, to our world, as Lord"], [48, "The Mystery of the 40 and Lady St. Mavor, or, worse still, as Lord and Lady Clovelly. Would not death be preferable to seeing one's name day after day in the papers, to have the whole of the tragedy that is awaiting at my door raked up either in pity or in scorn ? No, Dick, a marriage with me is an impossibility, and this must be our last meeting.\" Richard sat listening intently. Every argu ment advanced by Lady Mary against their marriage found a ready echo in his breast. She, in fact, was filling in the details of the picture the outlines of which he had suddenly beheld a few hours ago when in the banker's room. But the two most appalling figures \u2014 his father and mother \u2014 she had not even touched. Was she also frightened at a de scription of these ? Was it design or accident that had caused the omission on her part ? It could not be the latter. A woman with so clear a perception of things, with so great a power of marshalling facts, and a faculty of deducing their moral and social consequences, could not be blind to the supremest fact and"], [49, "Patrician Club. 41 consequence of all \u2014 to the impending fact which put all the possibly eventual ones in the background. On the other hand, Richard knew Mary to be too honest to shelve de liberately an argument which in her plea against the marriage would have been more powerful than all the rest. What did it mean ? Richard endeavoured to answer the question, but his brain was in a whirl. Amidst all this confusion, however, the dread of losing Mary for ever seemed not only to overshadow but displace all other considerations. His imagi nation, much more vivid than Mary's, had completed her picture or series, which, after all, was but filled in summarily. Added to these there were the full lengths of his parents, brothers, and sisters, in their despair, which had found no place in her rapid delineations ; and yet, dwarfing the whole was his own presentment, wandering through successive scenes, grave or gay, but always with the same sad look of baffled hope upon it. When he had warned Lady Mary against construing the offer to his hand into a proof of \" chival-"], [50, "The Mystery of the 42 rous pity \" he had instinctively forestalled an accusation which he knew to be not alto gether groundless. At that moment, though it was but a little while ago, he himself was not aware of his boundless affection for her ; the true state of his feelings had flashed upon him when he heard that they were to meet no more, and he sat completely dazed. Not for long. In a few minutes he rose deliber ately from his chair, walked over to Mary's, caught hold of both her hands, and compelled her, as it were, by sheer force to face him in an upright position. \" Is my love of so little avail then, Mary,\" he said at last, \" that you dare not risk soli tude with me ?\" She quivered from head to foot ; he felt her hands tremble in his. \" Your love, Dick, and that of my uncle, is all I have left on earth, but \" \u2014 and here a wan smile over spread her features \u2014 \"you must remember the words of the cavalier poet \u2014 they are pertinent on this occasion if ever they were \u2014"], [51, "Patrician Club. 43 ' I could not love thee, dear, so much, Loved I not honour more.' At least, such honour as will be left when everything is over,\" she added, in a tone of calm despair, which struck a chill into the heart of Richard Clynborough. He made another attempt. \" How would it be, Mary, if we boldly confronted the disgrace and let the world do and say its worst ? \" \" I think I understand your meaning, Dick. You would have us remain in England, marry, and, to use the familiar saying, let the storm blow over us. This is simply sheer mad ness, my dear, good darling. Such a storm as that which is upon us neither abates nor ceases while there remains aught in its course to destroy. You are under the impression that it would only wreak its work upon you and me. It would blight and blast the pros pects of every member of your family. Against the only member of mine it would be prac tically powerless. It would first of all con demn your sisters to lifelong spinsterhood ; it"], [52, "The Mystery of the 44 would debar your brothers from contracting any marriage in their own station of life ; it would compel your married sisters to retire from society and your brothers-in-law from their clubs, their pursuits, social as well as professional.

They had many friends, all eager to assist them. Not one could venture to offer them a home under their roof.\" \" But if so, Mary,\" said Richard, drawing her closer to him, \" what will become of you?\" \" You need have no fear on my account. I have a duty to perform which will effec tually prevent me from giving much thought to myself, especially in the beginning.

She must communicate with no one, for I intend to leave her, if possible, in ignor ance of the catastrophe that will make her a free woman, though Heaven knows her free dom will not be of much use to her. That will be my share of the Brackelonde inherit ance,\" she said bitterly. All at once she started violently and moved away from Richard's side. She had caught"], [54, "46 The Mystery of the Patrician Club. the reflection of her father's face in the glass over the mantelpiece. There was a fiendish smile on his face, as, from the other end of the room, he slowly said : \" You cannot divide the spoil before the enemy is dead, and I am not aware that my last moments have come.\""], [55, "CHAPTER III. Contrary to Lord Brackelonde's expecta tion, Lady Mary and Richard almost im mediately recovered from their surprise, and stood facing him calmly, though the young fellow's face was not quite so placid as that of his companion. It wore a kind of curious expression \u2014 the kind of expression one notices on the faces of those assembled in court when a great criminal is being tried. Richard felt no fear, for more reasons than one. The dominant sensation was that of curiosity. He apprehended no bodily danger.

I had, therefore, better tell you at once. I have come to ask Lady Mary to be my wife.\" Scoundrel as he was, even Lord Bracke londe saw the enormous sacrifice implied in Richard's words, but it provoked no gratitude on his part. He was bent upon getting an explanation of the exact extent of Richard's knowledge of the events that led to Jasper Davenport's introduction to the \" Clovelly faction,\" as he called it.

It was his nature to taunt, and even under these exceptional circumstances his nature got the better of him. \" Indeed,\" he said. \" Well, Lady Mary Stalforth is not a bad match for a younger son, even for the youngest son of Lord Clovelly. But assuredly there was no need to divide my inheritance, as you were evi dently doing when I walked in.\" This time Richard blazed forth, and Mary's glance of entreaty came too late. \" I would ask you, my Lord, to remember that I am under your roof, lest I should forget it.\" \" There is nothing to remember on my part, Mr. Clynborough, and there is ap parently nothing you are likely to forget, not even your future wife's share of my estate.\" It was very evident to Lady Mary, who had remained cool throughout, that her father"], [59, "Patrician Club. 51 had heard but part of the sentence, but before she had time to rectify his error with regard to it Richard burst out once more, \u2014 \" It would scarcely be safe to do that, my Lord, because under certain circumstances, upon which I need not dwell here, the estate of no matter whom is forfeited to the crown.\" Then more calmly : \" But you are altogether labouring under a misapprehension. The part of your inheritance Lady Mary was ap propriating is your wife, whom she intends to remove from England with the least possible delay.\" \" And by what right does Lady Mary assume the custody and protectorship of Lady Brackelonde ? \" asked Lord Brackelonde. He was studious to avoid addressing his daughter. His aim was to draw out Richard. On the other hand, Richard, whether he detected the design or not, was careful not to be drawn out. He turned to Lady Mary. \"That she had better explain herself,\" he said.

Richard's retreat would put an end to his (Lord Brackelonde's) chances of discovering the exact amount of informa tion in possession of the Clynborough family.

You asked me by what right I pretended to remove your wife from your power, for that was the gist of your question. By the right of protecting a fellow-creature against the murderous designs of a fiend in human shape.\" Richard stared aghast at Lady Mary. For a moment he was under the impression that the events of the last twenty-four hours had proved too much for her, that the pent-up excitement had upset the mental balance. Then he suddenly recollected the episode of the sleeping draught administered to Lady Brackelonde, and came to the conclusion that Mary considered her father quite capable of removing another awkward witness by an overdose of the narcotic if necessary. The banker had not told him the details, nor of the subsequent purchase of the drug to replace surreptitiously that which was gone, and he looked for the effect of the accusation in Lord Brackelonde's face. The latter sat positively puzzled for a"], [63, "Patrician Club. 55 moment. The finale to his visit to the Stan coombe chemist had been so overpowering as to have driven the introductory part of it temporarily from his mind. Besides, he did not know of Dr. Swanston's sudden summons on the previous evening, and least of all could he conceive the audacity of anyone in his household tampering with parcels or letters addressed to him. Lord Brackelonde was nothing short of a tyrant in his own home, and feared as such ; consequently he really did not catch the drift of his daughter's accusation, and by his blank look conveyed as much. \" At present,\" he said at last, \" you are talking in riddles ; but if you mean to insinuate that I have any design upon your step-mother's life you'll compel me to believe, though reluctantly, that you have taken leave of your senses.\" \" I am quite indifferent as to whether you believe me sane or insane.

Besides, an overdose of chloral is such an easy thing to administer that every bungling 'prentice playwright takes it as a pivot for his plot ! \" \" Enough,\" thundered Lord Brackelonde, roused at last, and starting from his chair in a threatening attitude, which, however, pro duced not the slightest effect on his daughter. \" Enough,\" he repeated, \" I will be master in my own house, and do as I like and if I like, without rhyme or reason, and without giving an account of my doings to anyone.

It was in order to prevent a scandal \u2014 the scandal of your gentle step-mother's elopement with her cousin.\" Richard had a flash of inspiration, but kept outwardly calm. \" One moment, my Lord,\" he said. \" I asked you to remember that you were in your house, lest I should forget it. But I cannot allow your statement to pass unchallenged. I am not called upon to defend Lady Brackelonde, but Captain James Ed mundsbury is my dearest friend, and I feel bound to give your insinuation with regard to him a formal and unqualified denial. On the night you administered the sleeping draught to your wife lest she should elope with her cousin the latter was in Paris.\" \" He was supposed to be,\" sneered Lord Brackelonde, in the heat of the moment. \" In reality he never went further than Dover, whence, instead of crossing, he drove to within a mile of the Dene, where he kept the carriage waiting, and prowled about the park until daylight, waiting for ' the lady,' who"], [66, "The Mystery of the 58 was fast asleep, thanks to my precau tions.\" While he was speaking the door of the library had opened and closed softly, admit ting Mr. Walter Greybridge, who stood silently in the middle of the room. Richard felt a weight lifted off his mind. This was the alibi he wanted for Jack Edmundsbury, and which Jack was determined not to pro duce. Moreover, it had been given in the hearing of someone who was admissible as a witness, and it would not be difficult to trace the driver of the carriage. Elated at his suc cess, he was going to let the matter drop. Unfortunately the banker, who hated his brother-in-law intensely, had not the same reasons for being considerate. As a rule he was too generous and noble-minded to crow over a defeated enemy, but in this instance he allowed his indignation to get the better of him. \" Then that disposes effectually of your story to Lady Brackelonde that Captain Ed mundsbury is the murderer of Gustave"], [67, "Patrician Club. 59 Dubois,\" he said, \" for Captain Edmundsbury could not have been in London and in Bracke londe Park at the same time.\" Lord Brackelonde saw, but when too late, that he had fallen into the trap so cleverly set for him by Richard Clynborough. He was fuming inwardly, but kept, nevertheless, out wardly cool and self-possessed, and deter mined there and then upon a momentary retreat, previous to executing an offensive flank movement. \" In olden times,\" he re marked, quietly, \" a man did not waylay and kill his enemy himself; he hired a bravo to do the work for him. It made him none the less a murderer. The whole thing was ad mirably planned in every respect but one. The principal ought to have instructed his con federate to rob the victim. In that way justice would have been led off the scent ; the motive would have been apparent. As it is, the police will have to find out the hidden reason of the crime ; they will have to discover the man who could possibly have an interest in the waiter's death. But,\" he went on, \" that"], [68, "The Mystery of the 60 ought to be child's play to them, seeing that at the present moment there are between three and four hundred men whispering the name of the murderer to one another. Some of these will be driven by their conscience to reveal it to the authorities if the latter fail in finding it out for themselves.\" The banker, even in his anger, could not help remarking to himself that his brother-in law's last words were almost similar to those he had addressed to Richard, but on his way from Lady Brackelonde's boudoir to the library, and while as yet ignorant of Lord Brackelonde's presence in the house, he had resolved upon a desperate effort to save him from the gallows for the women's sake. The unexpected sight of him had only strengthened that resolve, but he was well aware that its carrying out would entail \" the dropping of all euphemism.\" \" One can't scrape a cathe dral with a penknife, nor force a prison lock with a toothpick, and virtually I am en deavouring to force a prison lock,\" he men tally repeated to himself."], [69, "Patrician Club. 61 \" You may be right in what you say about the three or four hundred men whispering a name in connection with the murder of Gustave Dubois,\" replied Mr. Greybridge, slowly, \" but the name of the real murderer is as yet only known to less than half-a-dozen people. They, and they only, know whose interest it was to remove the card-room waiter of the Patrician from off the face of the earth and to silence him forever.\" He laid great stress on his words, and did not take his eyes off Lord Brackelonde, but the latter neither budged nor winced, and it became patent to the speaker that nothing but the big artillery of direct counter-accusation would dislodge him from the position he had taken up. Seeing which, he went on still more deliberately : \" I repeat, the name of the real murdei'er of Gustave Dubois is as yet only known to less than half-a-dozen people, and they, with the exception of one, would fain save him from the gallows, not from any feeling of affection, but because his fate would brand them also with everlasting disgrace. I doubt whether"], [70, "62 The Mystery of the a consideration of that kind will carry any weight with the murderer himself, but it will at least enable him to make an effort\u2014 and probably a successful one \u2014 to escape.\" \" Yes, I can understand that,\" said Lord Brackelonde, airily. \"The arrest, trial, con viction, and execution of Captain James Edmundsbury would be very disagreeable to my wife's family, the more so that he would go to his unhonoured grave branded as a cheat and a blackleg ; for, as a matter of course, the prosecution would not hesitate a moment to show the motive of the crime, which, as you say, was to remove the card-room waiter of the Patrician from off the face of the earth and to silence him for ever. In fact, I may tell you frankly that I am very sorry I stirred in the matter ; but it was done on the impulse of the moment, and before I could fairly realize the consequences of the charge. I am not speaking of the ultimate conse quences, which I could in no way foresee. Not that I am sorry for the death of that"], [71, "Patrician Club. 63 waiter ; he only got what he deserved for lending himself to such a transaction and then trying to make capital out of it by black mailing.\" The whole of this \" little speech '' \u2014 for Lord Brackelonde evidently intended it as such \u2014 was delivered in a most benign manner, and listened to in almost breathless silence by his small auditorium. Two out of the three were positively transfixed. On the banker, though, it failed to produce a similar effect. He knew the speaker of old, and had seen him at work before under similar circum stances \u2014 nearly a quarter of a century ago. It was well that astonishment did not get the better of him, for it enabled him at the end to prevent the mischief Richard was obviously bent upon as he rushed forward with clenched fist and flashing eye.

However, all this is not to the point. Nothing that you can say or do will convince me that you are not the murderer of Gustave Dubois ; and James Drayton is so certain of it that he has asked me to take your daughter out of the way before he lays hands on you.

I have never spoken to that waiter in my life.\" \" That's a lie, and you know it. What's more, we know it too, for you had a long conversation with him in your own park near the pond not later than a fortnight ago to- morrow.\" A greenish tint overspread Lord Bracke londe's face, but he would not give in. \" This vol. 11. f"], [74, "The Mystery of the 66 is simply so much unsupported assertion,\" he said. \" It is much more than that, and, depend upon it, Jasper Drayton will soon find a trace of Gustave Dubois' journey to Stancoombe or Brackelonde.

It was a random shot on his part, but he noticed that it produced its effect.

Mr. Greybridge picked it up in silence, then turned to him. \" If, after this,\" he said, \" you think there is still time to be lost, you had better risk it.\" \" You are right,\" gasped Lord Brackelonde, \" there is no time to be lost.\" F 2"], [76, "CHAPTER IV.

In spite of their previous knowledge, they had up to that moment not absolutely shrunk from Lord Brackelonde ; their abhorrence of his crime, of which, once more, they had had no doubt, had not prevented them from speaking to and even most vehemently contradicting him ; but no sooner had the two sentences in"], [77, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 69 reply to Mr. Greybridge's remark left Lord Brackelonde's lips, than a deep, deathlike silence fell upon the room, which, suddenly as it were, seemed to them to contract in size and to allow no sufficient space between themselves and the murderer.

They only breathed freely when they were in the hall ; but speech still refused to come, and without uttering a word they ascended the staircase to Lady Mary's room, where the two men, apparently exhausted and almost prostrate, sank into chairs, not even attempting to brush away the cold per spiration which stood in beads on their foreheads.

Failing to get a reply, the girl became impatient. \"Are we to let them take him like a rat in a trap?\" she exclaimed, slightly raising her voice. \" Not if we can prevent it,\" murmured the banker, after a little while ; \" but I fail to see how we can prevent it.\" \" We can at least try to prevent it,\" was the retort. \" How ? \" laconically queried Mr. Grey bridge and Richard in the same breath.

Wakeford, the head coachman, though fully fifteen years younger than Lord Brackelonde, bore a remarkable likeness to him, or rather to Frederick Stalforth that had been, namely, the beardless Lord Brackelonde. The cause of that likeness dated back as far as the beginning of the century, and its elucidation is not pertinent to the story ; the cause was, in fact, rarely alluded to by the inhabitants of Brackelonde. It was no secret, people had simply left off talking about it. Wake ford's father, grandfather, and great grand father, had been head coachmen at the Dene before him. In justice to Lord Brackelonde be it said that when the likeness cropped up again in the third generation of the Wake fords he did not make it a pretext for dis missing a trusty and deserving servant. The two men were curiously alike in height and shape as well as in features.

Then he turned reluc tantly to convey his niece's instructions to her father. Lord Brackelonde occupied a set of rooms on the ground floor, from which, when he was"], [89, "Patrician Club. 81 permanently at the Dene, he rarely stirred except to go into the library, or at the dinner hour. Of late even the pretext of taking that meal in common had not been kept up. On that day the gong had boomed in vain, and Roberts's personal intimation that \" dinner was ready,\" had been met by Lady Mary's answer that he could tell her father and ask him to excuse Mr. Greybridge, Mr. Clyn borough and herself. Roberts was too well bred a servant to express open astonishment at anything, but his experience of Lady Mary as a trencherwoman told him that there was something radically amiss when she declined her food. His suspicions to that effect were still further confirmed when, on knocking at Lord Brackelonde's bedroom door to give Lady Mary's message, he found it locked \u2014 an unusual thing, \u2014 and wasvtold by his Lordship that he should not dine, but would ring for something by-and-by.

G"], [90, "82 The Mystery of the to the servants' hall whence he was sum moned a few minutes later to order the' carriage. He was under the impression that Mr. Greybridge and Richard were going back to Stancoombe, though he could not help wondering why Lady Mary \"wanted Wake ford to drive.\" As a rule the head coachman was left in peace except on special occasions. Roberts wondered still more when, instead of the banker, Lady Mary turned out to be Richard's companion, but true to his princi ples, which had stood him in good stead, he wondered silently and undemonstratively ; and while Mr. Greybridge kept gazing at the fast disappearing brougham, he returned to his own quarters to enjoy his supper and his pipe and his newspaper afterwards. The dinner hour at the Dene varied from eight in the winter to half-past eight in the summer. Mr. Greybridge took out his watch, and as it still wanted several minutes to nine, he betook himself slowly to the dining-room, expecting to find Lord Brackelonde there. Roberts had not considered it necessary to"], [91, "Patrician Club. 83 inform the banker of his Lordship's refusal to dine ; in fact, it was a rule in Roberts's life never to volunteer information on any subject. In one of her lighter moods Lady Mary had nick-named him Grimaud, after Athos's ser- vant in the \" Three Musketeers,\" though she knew he would never turn out as faithful in an emergency. The dining-room was empty, and one glance sufficed to show Mr. Grey- bridge that no one had sat down to dinner. I n reality he was not surprised. \" Cool as he is,\" he said to himself, as it were, \" I did not expect him to sit down to dinner under the cir- cumstances. He is probably in the library.'' The library, however, was as empty as the dining-room, and the position of the chairs made it patent that it had been vacated by Lord Brackelonde immediately after the ter- mination of the interview. The envelope and the telegram, the latter of which had finally broken down all further resistance on Lord Brackelonde's part, were lying on the floor. The few words it contained were absolutely unintelligible to the uninitiated, so Mr. Grey- g 2"], [92, "84 The Mystery of the bridge left it where it was. \" Packing, may be,\" he said, almost aloud, as he crossed the apartment to the door which opened into the passage that led to his brother-in-law's private rooms. The door of the sitting-room stood ajar, but that of the bedroom was shut. After knocking two or three times without obtaining an answer, Mr. Greybridge gently tried the handle, which yielded to his pres sure, but once more he stood within an empty room. There was only the bath and dressing room beyond, and a moment's examination of it proved the futility of all further search in that quarter. Mr. Greybridge was too familiar with his brother-in-law's habits when at home to attempt to look for him in any other part of the house, and was consequently standing somewhat irresolute in the bath-room, mechanically glancing around and trying to find amidst the surroundings a clue to Lord Brackelonde's proceedings after they had left him, when his eye caught a small object on the wash-stand which afforded him an inkling of what had happened. The object in ques-"], [93, "Patrician Club. 85 tion was simply a shaving-brush, an im plement which to his knowledge Lord Brackelonde had not used for several years. Wishing to make perfectly sure before drawing further conclusions, the banker took it up. It was wet, the lather was still in it. The truth suddenly dawned upon him. His brother-in-law, as a means of avoiding recognition, had got rid of his beard, and that could only mean one thing \u2014 a preparation for flight. By which way had he escaped ? There was no issue from the bath-room, but there was a door leading from the bedroom to the park. Had any one seen him go ? Mr. Greybridge was about to ring the bell, when he suddenly checked himself. He had better not arouse suspicion or curiosity. Then he began to examine the contents of the ward robes ; everything was in perfect order. Lord Brackelonde had departed in the clothes he wore that day, and without a single scrap of luggage. \" He has more pluck than I credited him with,\" said Mr. Greybridge to himself; \"but his single-"], [94, "S6 The Mystery of the Patrician Club. handed work will sadly upset Mary's plans.\" He made his way back to the dining-room and rang for something to eat.

We had better keep a sharp look-out on each side by the side of the blinds.\" At first their vigilance met with no reward. Apparently there was not a living soul about.

Nor did they pay much heed to the stranger who stood chatting to Ephraim Masters out side the Brackelonde Arms.

The inn, a considerable and attractive one for so small a place, was almost opposite the great gates, and its former land lord was fond of repairing thither when the business of the day was over. Masters bore not the least ill-will to his successor, who was a comparative stranger to those parts, and had only taken the place when, by Masters' own admission, all prospects of his retaining it were gone. Ephraim had always been, and was still, a general favourite in the village, which tacitly disapproved of the high-handed proceedings of Lord Brackelonde against a good fellow for having allowed his tongue to wag too freely in his cups. Ephraim had been born and bred among them, and during his tenancy of the Brackelonde Arms had"], [97, "Patrician Club. 89 proved their friend in many instances, so that, when the blow came, and he deter mined to remain at Brackelonde nevertheless, his decision was hailed with universal satis faction.

He, however, spent most of his leisure time, when not on his rounds to buy cattle, at the Bracke londe Arms, between which the new occupant and himself there had sprung up a cordial liking. The subject of Lord Brackelonde's vindictiveness towards him (Ephraim) was, however, rigorously tabooed, for various reasons, the most valid amongst them being that, unlike Masters in days of yore, Frank-"], [98, "The Mystery of the 90 stone (his successor) held the Brackelonde Arms on a very short lease, and was, therefore, anxious not to incur his Lordship's displeasure by appearing to criticize his conduct himself or by allowing it to be criticized under his roof; for the wrong done him was rankling in Ephraim's breast, and found vent every now and then in very strong invective. Of course, Frankstone tried to stop him when he was within his own walls, and generally succeeded. Masters, though vindictive to a degree in this instance, had sufficient sense of justice not to expose his successor to unnecessary risks on his account ; but else where he scarcely minded what he said, and found willing listeners, especially at the market ordinary at the Golden Lion in Stan coombe. Miss Drayton had fairly described to her cousin the feeling of the neighbour hood with regard to Lord Brackelonde. Though a liberal landlord, he was not liked. Of all those who sympathized with Ephraim Masters, Miss Drayton was- undoubtedly the"], [99, "Patrician Club. 91 most sympathetic. They had known one another from their childhood, for that branch of the Drayton family had been located for more than a century at Stancoombe. Joseph Drayton, Miss Drayton's grandfather, had been head partner in the firm of solicitors Drayton and Greybridge ; the Greybridge in question was the grandfather of Walter and Vincent Greybridge. James Drayton, the Jasper Davenport of our story, belonged to the North of England, but, having lost both his parents when young, he came to his uncle's home at Stancoombe, whence he went to Rugby, and subsequently entered the army. Most of his holidays, however, were spent in the provincial town until the crash came. His disappearance, when it became an ascertained fact, caused little or no sur- prise, for by that time the engagement of Miss Greybridge to Lord Frederick Stal- forth \u2014 people continued to call him by that name after his elder brother died, though his courtesy title was Lord Pelmar \u2014 was publicly discussed. James Drayton was"], [100, "The Mystery of the 92 looked upon as the victim of a woman's fickleness, but the Stancoombe world and the county set, though full of pity, reserved their great compassion for his cousin, Miss Drayton, who, it was whispered, fell a victim at the same time to a man's treachery, it being an open secret that she was deeply attached to the second son of the Marquis of Brackelonde. There was no formal engagement, nor had there ever been, as far as the world knew, but the young people were a great deal together, Lord Frederick paying the only daughter of the prosperous solicitor the most assiduous attention. And when the rumour went forth that the blow had affected Caroline Drayton to such a degree as to make a re moval to the Continent absolutely imperative, the banker's daughter and her new fiance came in for extremely harsh comments.

But he knew Lord Frederick Stalforth, and he found it hard to believe that there was anyone in the world sufficiently shrewd, or, rather, sufficiently idiotic, to attempt to cheat him at cards or otherwise. Though his curiosity was greatly excited, he deemed it more politic not to gather information on the subject by correspondence. The Brackelondes did not like to have their affairs discussed by their tenants and depen dents, and old Ephraim Masters, the ser geant's father, knew this so well that he not only never mentioned them himself, but forbade his children to do so. The smart young soldier was the more resigned to abide by his father's wishes in this respect inso much as he felt confident of being able to get at the truth in another way. He was going on leave shortly, and there was a pretty maid at the Draytons', Miss Drayton's personal attendant, who was sure to know \u2014 for Ser geant Masters, in common with most people, looked upon Miss Drayton as the future Lady Brackelonde. Martha Clarewell would"], [103, "Patrician Club. 95 trust him not only with her heart's secrets but those of everyone else. Great, therefore, was Sergeant Masters' surprise when, shortly after his arrival, and during their first evening stroll, Martha professed complete ignorance of the matter. Young Ephraim was far from a fool, and he saw that the girl was speaking the absolute truth. Instead of being the informed, he became the informant. He repeated to her, word for word, what he had gathered from the officers' conversation. Had not Lord Frederick told her young mistress of it ? \" Lord Frederick ? Lord Pelmar, you mean,\" said Martha, contemptuously. \" Why, he has not been near her for the last two months or more. If ever there was an en gagement, it must have been broken off about that time.\" Ephraim instinctively began to compare dates.

While everybody in and near Stancoombe saw that he was making up to Miss Greybridge, riding and driving with her, Miss Drayton took not the slightest notice, and was as sweet as ever when he did call now and then.\" \" Miss Greybridge, did you say ?\" queried Ephraim. \" I understood that Miss Grey bridge was going to marry James Drayton.\" Thereupon Martha told her sweetheart how the young lieutenant had suddenly dis appeared, and of the coolness that had arisen between the Greybridges and the Draytons, though Mr. Walter and Mr. Vincent were as friendly as ever. \" If anything, they are more often at our house than they were before,\" she added."], [105, "Patrician Club. 97 \" And I think they want to show that they have no part or parcel in the quarrel that has taken place, for I feel sure there was a quarrel.\" Sergeant Masters, who had a shrewd head on his shoulders, gradually put two and two together, and, having had occasion to go to London once or twice, where he fell in with a couple of non-commissioned officers of Lieutenant Drayton's regiment \u2014 the meeting was not purely accidental on Masters' part \u2014 he succeeded in ferreting out part, if not the whole of the truth. There was no doubt in his mind about James Drayton's innocence, though of course he was not sufficiently versed in the etiquette of the card-room and the rules of club- life to be able to determine by what means the accusation against him had been framed and accepted. But he had known James Drayton and Lord Frederick Stalforth from their boyhood, and between the honesty of the one and that of the other Sergeant Masters' mind never wavered for an instant. VOL. II. h"], [106, "98 The Mystr ry of the From that time forth Ephraim Masters conceived an intense dislike to Lord Frederick, which did not decrease as the years went by, though his position forbade his giving vent to it. Having experienced much kindness at the hands of the Draytons, he felt corre spondingly grateful, and that feeling also grew stronger. When in due course he married pretty Martha Clarewell, after her return from abroad, whither she had accompanied Miss Drayton, whose life, when the truth of Lord Frederick's desertion could no longer be hidden from her, was despaired of by Dr. Swanston's predecessor, a much cleverer physician and more genuine gentleman at heart than his successor. A twelvemonth's absence in the south of France and Geneva had, however, the desired effect, and Miss Drayton came back to all appearance the charming, handsome girl of old, though more subdued in manner. The only drawback to Ephraim's happy marriage was his almost enforced tenancy of the Brackelonde Arms.

He idolized his daughter, who was an only child, but his great affection for her notwith standing, he trained her in the way he meant her to go, and in his opinion the bar-parlour of a public-house \u2014 even if the latter was dig nified by the name of \" inn \" and properly conducted \u2014 was not the place for her, at any rate not while she was single. At the same time, he was averse to her going out into the world, in the accepted sense of the word. A kind of compromise was effected by her becoming Miss Drayton's maid and quasi companion. Clarewell would have trusted old Mr. Drayton and his family with anything and everything he possessed in this world. Clarewell was greatly attached to the busi ness which his father and grandfather had, as it were, built up. At the time of Ephraim's appearance on the scene in quest of Clarewell's pretty daughter, there was still a lease of nearly twenty years to run. The smart sergeant of dragoons was by no H 2"], [108, "The Mystery of the 100 means well off in point of money, but his poverty did not affect Clarewell's views of the affair. He made only two conditions to the marriage \u2014 that Ephraim should leave the army and should join him in the manage ment of the Brackelonde Arms. That was how Ephraim Masters became virtually, and much against his will, Lord Brackelonde's tenant. Subsequent events, related by Miss Dray ton to her cousin, only tended to intensify Mr. and Mrs. Masters' reluctance to come in contact with Lord Brackelonde ; nor were they at first more favourably disposed to wards Lady Pelmar \u2014 or Lady Frederick Stalforth, as they chose to call her. It required the erstwhile Miss Greybridge's conjugal martyrdom, which was no secret to them, to change their feeling towards her. \" Her crime carries its punishment,\" said Martha Masters, consciously paraphrasing Sir Peter Teazle, for she was rather well read for one in her station of life, and fond of showing her advantages in that respect."], [109, "Patrician Club. 101 The gradual goodwill that sprang up in her breast towards the mother was in a great measure transferred to the daughter, whose quiet powers of fascination, added to still more sterling qualities, few people were able to withstand. Masters himself was proof against it. But neither he nor she ever relented towards Lord Brackelonde. They tacitly avoided all mention of his name in public, and if now and then it cropped up in the privacy of their own room, it was uttered with an expression of fierce hatred, which would have bred the suspicion in the listener's mind that there was between these three the secret of a crime too heinous for human charity, if not for pardon. If such a secret existed, it was carefully kept within their breasts, so carefully as to defy the curiosity of all but the most observant. Such, at any rate, was the innate convic tion of Mr. Hargreaves, Lord Brackelonde's agent, the same who had told Masters, some years before the opening of this story, that his lease would not be renewed. Mr. Har-"], [110, "The Mystery of the 102 greaves never forgot the look that passed between Mrs. Masters and her husband. It was absolutely instantaneous, and the words that followed it were commonplace enough, but the agent could never afterwards divest himself of the idea. Long before that Lord Brackelonde himself had intercepted a similar look and drawn a similar conclusion, and his high-handed proceedings on the occasion referred to had been prompted by a desire to \"draw Masters out \" rather than by a deter mination to withhold the new lease eventu ally as a punishment for Masters' comments upon Rebecca Walford. But his Lordship had reckoned without a true knowledge of his tenant's character. When Lord Bracke londe gave him his categorical refusal, Masters stared him full in the face for a moment ; a sentence was apparently hovering on his lips, but he set his teeth tightly as if to check its utterance, turned on his heel without a word, and left the room without so much as a backward glance. He breathed more freely when outside, but felt violently"], [111, "Patrician Club. 103 angry with himself for having yielded to his wife's entreaties \" to try not to let the place go.\" Martha Masters was an admirable woman in almost every respect ; their twenty years of married life had been unclouded by any serious misunderstanding ; but her only weak point was an inordinately sentimental attachment to the house where she was born, a feeling she had inherited from her father. But for that attachment her husband would have relinquished the tenancy of the Bracke londe Arms at his father-in-law's death, for it was repugnant to his generous nature \" to be beholden for his livelihood to the only living creature he hated,\" as he expressed it to his wife. She, however, would barely listen to his pleadings, and argued logically that there was no obligation on their part. It was a pure business matter, Lord Bracke londe receiving as good as he gave. Neither then nor afterwards did Masters upbraid his wife for having sent him on a forlorn hope. He could understand, though he could not agree with, the feelings that had"], [112, "The Mystery of the 104 prompted her, but his hatred of Lord Bracke londe grew still more intense, and when about a twelvemonth after leaving the \"inn\" his wife died, from no apparent or ascertainable cause, he attributed her loss to her grief, perhaps not without some founda tion. From that day forth his hatred, hitherto pent up, found vent in the bitterest invective. None of it ever reached Lord Bracke londe's ear, for though it would not have affected him, the transmittor, if one of his dependants, would have suffered, seeing that the utterer was beyond his power. The family itself was left in similar ignorance, but for a different reason. No one would have willingly caused Lady Mary or her step mother a moment's pain, not even Masters himself ; and thus it came about that the daughter harboured no suspicion on seeing the avowed enemy of her father engaged in earnest conversation with a total stranger at the very time when the knowledge of the enmity would have stood her in good stead"], [113, "Patrician Club: 105 by putting her on her guard. And thus it was that Lady Mary, after having passed the Brackelonde Arms and cast a few more looks from her corner at the roadside, leant back in the carriage without bestowing a second thought on Masters or his companion. Not for long, though. The night was very still, and the well-hung carriage bowled along the smooth road almost noiselessly. Suddenly there rang upon the air the measured sound of another set of hoofs. Lady Mary listened intently for a few moments ; it was a horse without a carriage advancing at a smart trot in their direction. She was about to raise the pad from the tiny pane of glass at the back of the brougham when she bethought herself that, at the pace the animal was advancing, it would soon overtake them, when she would have an opportunity of seeing the horseman's face by the light of the brightly burning carriage lamps as he passed. She gave directions to Richard to the same effect, in case the rider should take the wrong side of the road. But"], [114, "106 The Mystery of the both waited and watched in vain. The horseman, whoever he was, made it a point to .keep a certain distance between himself and the brougham, though there was room enough and to spare for him to get ahead. He was evidently going to Stancoombe, for after the cross roads had been reached they could still hear him cantering on behind. Lady Mary endeavoured to persuade herself that all this was the result of mere accident. Her instinct, however, warned her to the contrary. There was no chance of seeing their pursuer's face \u2014 she already looked upon him as such \u2014 until they were fairly in Stancoombe, and even then she might be none the wiser for seeing it. Nevertheless, she congratulated herself upon her ruse \u2014 Wakeford had been the decoy she intended him to be.

Before Mr. Salter could proceed Lady Mary interrupted him. \" That's all right,\" she said, and her face showed that she had found a way out of the difficulty. \" They make such a fuss on the continent about cheques or big notes.

Richard looked up, surprised at the cheer fulness of her tone, suspecting it to be assumed for his sake ; but one glance con vinced him of the contrary.

Hence she chatted and insisted on accompanying Mr. Salter to the basement, carrying the lantern herself, and showing Richard the various safes, with the respective destinations of which she was familiar from her girlhood. And when at last the notes were extracted from their cases and a small bag of gold added to it \u2014 Lady Mary saw, not without dismay, that the whole would make a bigger bundle than she had expected, \u2014 she put her signature to the receipt with a flourish and amidst laughter"], [126, "118 The Mystery of the which made Mr. Greybridge's room ring and rejoiced the heart of the old cashier, who ascribed her merry mood to the girlish satis faction of getting the ornament she coveted.

All this had taken time, and it was now close upon eleven. While she was still talk ing to Mr. Salter she asked Richard to go and look for Wakeford, and if he did not find him at the door of the bank or at Mr. Saker's, to run to the stables. Richard was absent for more than twenty minutes, and returned with a face as pale as death. The brougham was standing in the yard, but neither the horse nor Wakeford was to be seen anywhere. The stable door stood wide open, and a lantern was burning brightly, but in Timothy's quarters all was wrapped in darkness. Timothy, when awakened, could, however, tell him nothing beyond that Wakeford came into the yard shortly before ten, just as he"], [127, "Patrician Club. 119 (Timothy) was going to bed, feeling very tired. Timothy offered to come down, but Wakeford called out to him not to trouble himself, but to throw him down the key of the stable ; the horse's shoe had got loose, and he would try to patch it up until he reached home. In a little while Wakeford said in a low voice, but sufficiently distinct for Timothy to hear him, that it wouldn't do, and that he was going to Cross, the farrier. Richard sent Timothy to Cross to tell Wake ford to make haste, but Cross had not set eyes on Wakeford \u2014 had, in fact, been in bed since half-past nine. Richard had scarcely finished speaking when Timothy himself came in by the back door. There was a blank look on his face, which under ordinary circumstances would have been intensely amusing to those who knew him, for as a rule it wanted a good deal to astonish him. \" Has Wakeford come back ? \" asked Lady Mary, before he could utter a word. \" No, my lady, he's not ; and from what I"], [128, "The Mystery of the 120 can see he's not likely to,\" was the answer. \" What do you mean, Hawkins ? \" \" Well, the harness of your horse is hanging up and master's best saddle is gone.

The return journey was accomplished in a comparatively short time, and Richard and Mary scarcely exchanged a word. She felt at an absolute loss to account for Wakeford's behaviour. With any other servant but him the explanation would not have appeared so difficult. The head coachman was abstemious to a fault. As far as she could remember he had never been found out telling an untruth, and here on the face of it he was guilty of one in pretending an accident to his horse in order to take flight \u2014 for what reason Heaven only knew. At this point her cogitations went off at a tangent. No, the words \" Heaven only knew,\" taken in their con ventional sense, did not represent the case in this instance.\" Wakeford had neither disap-"], [130, "The Mystery of the 122 peared from sheer perversity or in a half-mad, half-drunken fit ; his disappearance was a move in the desperate game she herself was playing, but why Wakeford had suddenly become an active partner in it instead of the mere lay figure she intended him to be, she failed to conceive. That he had become such an active partner while she was driving homeward she did not doubt for an instant. Beyond that certain knowledge, due to her instinct, all was pure conjecture \u2014 a dead wall with terrible pictures drawn on it, but with out a crevice or an aperture which would enable her to obtain a glimpse of the reality behind. She kept, nevertheless, perfectly cool ; so cool, in fact, as to arouse once more Richard's admiration. When about two or three hundred yards from the house she pulled the string for Hawkins to stop, got out, and told him to go to the stables by the back and not to mention a word about Wake ford's disappearance. If any of the stable men should ask, he was merely to say that"], [131, "Patrician Club. 123 the head coachman had remained at Stan coombe for the night to ride to Dover in the morning on a particular errand for her. This, she considered, would afford a plausible explanation both of Wakeford's absence and of the substitution of one of her uncle's horses for a favourite one with her father. Curiously enough, she only remembered then when she noticed Swiftfly in the shafts and remarked upon it, Wakeford had mumbled something in reply, but she was too engrossed with her own thoughts and too busy looking about her for the possible detective to take much heed. Moreover, everyone had perfect confidence in Wake ford's management, so she troubled no more about it. The recollection of the fact simply confirmed her in her already strong opinion that Wakeford's flight, whatsoever its motive, had been premeditated. Her precaution in getting out of the carriage and her instructions to Hawkins were mainly directed against Roberts, whom she did not like, though she frankly admitted"], [132, "The Mystery of the 124 to herself that he had never given her cause for dislike.

One feeling with regard to him never changed \u2014 he was not to be trusted. Hence, when she saw him standing on the top of the shallow flight of steps, evidently watching for their return, she congratulated herself on her foresight. For once in a way, though, she did Roberts an injustice, he was there under orders. \" I have been told to look out for the carriage, my lady,\" he said immediately ; \" Mr. Greybridge wishes you to come to him directly ; he is in the library.\" One glance at her uncle showed Lady Mary that an unexpected crisis in the drama had occurred during her absence ; nor did the banker leave her long in suspense. He"], [133, "Patrician Club. 125 waited for a few moments after the door was closed, for he shared her suspicions with regard to Roberts ; then came close to her and whispered, though loud enough for her and Richard to hear him, \" He's gone ; he has disappeared.\" The girl stood stock still, then calmly took off her hat and sat down. It was evident from her manner that she did not grasp the situation, and her words confirmed the impression. \" Did you not give him my message that we would be back with the money ? \" she said. \" I had no chance of giving him any message whatsoever. He was gone when I went into his room.\" And without waiting for any further remark on her part, the banker gave her the circumstantial account of Lord Brackelonde's disappearance as he (Mr. Greybridge) conceived it after his finding of the wet shaving brush on the washstand. \" With regard to money,\" he went on, \" I fancy he has provided himself. He must have foreseen the end, though he"], [134, "126 The Mystery of the may not have imagined it to be quite so near ; but the moment he discovered that Jasper Davenport and James Drayton were one and the same, he could not have been doubtful of the issue.

He may have had some doubt about it still. Our revelations and the tele gram made an end of it, as you saw.\" Lady Mary shook her head. \" That was not the reason. You do not know what has occurred at Stancoombe this evening while we were there? \" The banker looked up. \" At Stan coombe ? \" he repeated. \" Yes, at Stancoombe. I have had no time to tell you.\" And in her turn she gave"], [135, "Patrician Club. 127 him a detailed account of their journey, the pursuit of the stranger whom she had seen talking to Ephraim Masters, and, finally, of Wakeford's disappearance. \" Depend upon it,\" she concluded, \" Wakeford's disappear ance has something to do with all this. He is in a way fond of my father\" \u2014 the last words with a great gulp, \u2014 \" but I am abso lutely at a loss to find the link.\" For a little while she sat speechless and motionless, her hands folded in her lap, a picture of impotent grief at having had the fabric she had so carefully built up over toppled. Neither Mr. Greybridge nor Richard felt equal to resuming the conversa tion. They could offer no suggestion, and, least of all, consolation. The silence was broken at last by an excited knock at the door, and, before per mission to enter could be given, Timothy Hawkins had entered the room. His face was ghastly pale, and though visibly trying to control himself, he shook from nape to heel. \" Please, sir, may I speak to you for"], [136, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 128 a moment ?\" he stammered, addressing Mr. Greybridge. \" Yes, Tim ; what is it ? \" said Mr. Grey bridge, in the kindly tone he always adopted towards his old servants. \" There is something wrong at the stables, and I think Wakeford is off his head.\" At the name of Wakeford both Mary and Richard started off their seats, but the banker kept apparently calm. \" But Wakeford isn't there,\" he objected. \"Beg pardon, sir, but he is; he is stand ing smoking against the door of the hayloft, and when he saw the brougham he asked me as cool as cool could be how I came by it.\" \" What did you answer ? \" \" I didn't answer at all, but took the horse out.

When Hawkins had finished speaking a deep silence fell upon the room, its three principal occupants being at an absolute loss to shape their thoughts, let alone convey them to one another.

Whatever the upshot of Wakeford's explanation might be, they felt powerless now to alter the course of events by a hair's breadth. Wakeford's excitement had apparently sub sided, though the ground swell of it was still visible enough in the twitching of his lips and the quiver of his nostrils. As he stepped bareheaded to the middle of the room Richard gave an involuntary start. Never until that moment had the marvellous likeness between the coachman and Lord Brackelonde ap peared so striking to him, and he could not help asking himself how far the portrait of the latter which he handed to Jasper Daven port had contributed to the strengthening of the network in which Mary's father was en meshed. At the same time his conscience smote him in another direction.

His all-absorbing love for Mary, the depth of which he had perhaps not sus pected until that afternoon, made him almost false to his own cause. The few minutes that had elapsed between the departure of Hawkins and the entrance of Wakeford had determined Lady Mary's attitude towards the latter. She did not feel certain that he was not playing a part, in whose interest she failed to fathom. Why had he returned to the Dene by himself, and why did he pretend that Swiftfly had disap peared ? \" What is this cock-and-bull story about Swiftfly, Wakeford ? \" she began, in a stern tone of voice. k 2"], [140, "The Mystery of the 132 \" It's no cock-and-bull story, my lady,\" replied Wakeford, by no means meekly. \" She has disappeared, and Mr. Greybridge's roan is in her stall.\" Lady Mary looked him straight in the face, but he neither winced nor budged, and she felt positively puzzled. If this was acting, it was very good acting indeed. \" Didn't you ride her back from Stancoombe to-night ? \" she asked. \" I have not been near Stancoombe, my lady, and I rode Sally over to the Priory, not Swiftfly.\" \"Who put Swiftfly into the brougham to night ? \" \" Not I, my lady.\" \" But you were on the box when I made a remark about it, for you answered me.\" Wakeford looked at Lady Mary, and his expression of astonishment grew more intense. \" I can assure you, my lady, that I do not know what you mean. I have not been near Stancoombe this night ; I did not put Swiftfly into the shafts ; I was not on the box of the"], [141, "Patrician Club. 133 brougham. I took a letter from his Lordship to the Priory. The clock struck the quarter after seven when I started on Sally ; it was about a quarter past eight when I got to Velstrode. Lord Clynchland kept me waiting for about an hour and a half; and it struck half-past ten when I handed Roberts Lord Clynchland's answer.\" Wakeford's tone was so unmistakably sincere that all Lady Mary's doubts with regard to him vanished. \" What did Roberts do with the letter ? \" she asked. And before the answer was forthcoming she turned to Richard. \" Dick, go and see if it is in my father's room.\" Richard was back in a moment, holding betwixt his fingers an envelope bearing the Velstrode crest and addressed in Lord Clynchland's sprawling hand, with which Lady Mary was not altogether unfamiliar. To make assurance doubly sure she pushed it across the table to her uncle, who had better or worse reasons for knowing the heir of Velstrode's caligraphy than anyone, except"], [142, "The Mystery of the 134 the London money-lenders. At an affirma tive nod from the banker, intimating the genuineness of the superscription, she opened the letter without the least hesitation. It only contained a few lines. \" My dear Brackelonde,\" it ran, \" I have done what you asked me. Why was he in the way ? He has neither daughter nor wife. Is history to repeat itself ? Yours, Clynchland.\" Without a word she handed the open letter to Mr. Greybridge, who in his turn passed it over to Richard. One look between the three showed that they understood the drift of Lord Brackelonde's letter, from the answer to it. Wakeford was to be kept away for a certain number of hours from the Dene, but, like Lord Clynchland, they failed to conceive the reason. One thing was certain \u2014 it was not Wakeford who had driven the brougham to Stancoombe. Who was it ? They dreaded to answer the question which simultaneously presented itself to their minds. \"Who gave you the order to go to the Priory ? \" asked Lady Mary."], [143, "Patrician Club. 135 \" His Lordship himself, my lady.

Haw kins nearly always comes with Mr. Grey bridge, and I am sure to see him the moment he has taken the horse out. Mr. Greybridge drove himself this afternoon.

He did as he was told, and went to his supper with Copping. When he came back and found it gone, Cop-"], [145, "Patrician Club. 137 ping's son told him that I had taken it round to the front with Swiftfly in the shafts. As I told your ladyship, I was several miles away at the time. It's a puzzle to me, my lady.\" Wakeford's puzzle was gradually solving itself in Lady Mary's mind, but she didn't care to enlighten him until it was absolutely necessary. \" Go to your room, Wakeford, and wait till I come or send for you,\" she said kindly. \" Don't say a word to anybody. I can trust you. Something has happened ; I don't know what. I prefer not to trust to the others.\" When Wakeford was gone, she turned to her uncle and Richard, who both seemed bereft of speech, though it wanted but a single glance to perceive that the situation was gradually dawning upon them. \" Does it not strike you that the only man who can help us out with this is Roberts ? \" she asked. \" The only one, provided he will speak the truth,\" assented Mr. Greybridge, who shared his niece's suspicion with regard to Lord Brackelonde's valet. Richard said nothing."], [146, "The Mystery of the 138 He was still speculating as to his share in the catastrophe by means of the ill-fated sketch. At last he made a practical suggestion. \" To whom did you give the order to have the brougham brought round ? \" he said to Lady Mary. \" To Roberts,\" came the reply. \" Don't you remember ? My uncle rang and I opened the door at the same moment to give the order and to put my hat and jacket on. Roberts was coming up the stairs to say that dinner was on the table. I asked him to tell my father and to say that we had some important business to attend to which would prevent our coming down. I also asked him to give the message about the brougham to Wake ford.\" \" Then let me ring for Roberts,\" said Richard ; and on a nod from Lady Mary he did as he had suggested. In another moment Roberts made his appearance. Unlike Wake ford, Roberts was perfectly calm. He had expected this summons, and to a certain extent prepared for it. He had been vaguely"], [147, "Patrician Club. 139 conscious the whole evening that something unusual was going on, but in spite of his general talent for ferreting out things, he had got no further than that. His Lordship's door had remained obstinately closed when he (Roberts) had knocked at it, and in view of the strict orders, he had not dared go near it again ; though, had he done so, he would have found it wide open, as Mr. Greybridge found it less than half an hour afterwards \u2014 as he himself found it when he placed the letter brought by Wakeford from Velstrode Priory on his Lordship's dress ing table. It was, in fact, Lord Bracke londe's absence from his room at that par ticular moment, coupled with Wakeford's altogether unexpected apparition, that changed Roberts' hitherto vague suspicion into certainty ; /or he did not content himself with merely depositing the envelope in a spot sufficiently conspicuous for Lord Brackelonde to see it. Though Lord Brackelonde's features \" did not pay for watching,\" as Roberts had ex-"], [148, "The Mystery of the 140 pressed it more than once to himself, Roberts watched all the same. He could not do otherwise. The habit had become ingrained. Roberts was a born eaves dropper and spy, as some people are born actors, musicians, or painters. Having started life as under footman in a nobleman's family whose members conversed with one another very frequently in French, Roberts not only made it his business to acquire a sufficiently fair smattering of that language, but went to the length of courting a by no means good-looking French maid in order to accelerate his linguistic progress \u2014 a down right sacrifice on his part, seeing that he was well favoured and had a keen eye for a pretty woman. When he was able to under stand, he discovered that all his trouble had been in vain. The family never said a thing but what they might have shouted from the housetops in the most commonplace English. But the lesson was lost on him. He con tinued to watch and listen in his subsequent situations, perhaps not with a definite idea of"], [149, "Patrician Club. 141 profiting by what he saw and heard, but with a vague hope that chance might favour him one day with the possession of a secret, the suppression of which might lead to indepen dence. He had read of such occurrences, mainly in the reports of criminal trials for attempted blackmailing, but Roberts pro mised himself never to be caught in that way. Roberts' opinion that Lord Brackelonde's features did not pay for watching, might have been safely applied to his when Wakeford handed him Lord Clynchland's letter. By a powerful effort of will he stood perfectly still and assumed an air of indifference, while, in reality, he felt ready to drop to the floor and yell with astonishment. If he had been one whit less matter-of-fact and prosaic he would have fled with fright. Dr. Johnson believed in the Ghost of Cock Lane, but was not afraid of it. Mme. Geoffrin, that clever woman of fashion so greatly admired by Horace Walpole, did not believe in ghosts, but was afraid of them. Roberts was neither afraid"], [150, "The Mystery of the 142 of nor believed in ghosts. He did not mis trust his own sense of vision or of hearing ; consequently he concluded instantaneously that it was the head coachman in the flesh who was standing before him and addressing him. And yet he had seen this coachman on the box of the brougham in his livery ; he had watched him drive down the avenue. He now saw him in a dark tweed suit, holding a letter from Lord Clynchland, which he said he had brought from the Priory. Roberts made a rapid mental calculation, the result of which was that the driver of the brougham could not have gone first to Stancoombe, then to Velstrode, and have returned to the Dene in barely two hours, apart from the time it must have taken him to change his dress and wait for Lord Clynchland's letter. Nay, he could scarcely have gone to the Priory and back in two hours. There was not, there could be no doubt in Roberts's mind of Wakeford's identity as he stood there ; therefore, the in dividual on the box of the brougham could not have been Wakeford. Who was it ?"], [151, "Patrician Club. 143 It was the very question Lady Mary, Mr. Greybridge and Richard had asked them selves, but they shrank from supplying the answer. Roberts, on the contrary, felt eager to do so. The likeness between Lord Bracke londe and his head coachman had been as patent to him as it was to everyone else who caught a mere glimpse of the two men, and immediately after he got settled as Horner's successor in Lord Brackelonde's service he had taken indescribable pains to collect every particular of the story by judicious treating and pumping of the oldest inhabitants and so forth. Nevertheless, though the whole of that story was passing through his mind while he stood facing Wakeford, he took the letter from his hands without a single remark or question, and quietly turned away in the direction of his Lordship's apartments. The first step towards unravelling the mystery \u2014 for by that time he felt there was a mystery \u2014 was to ascertain the whereabouts of his Lordship. Roberts's estimate of his own capacities for ferreting did not err on the side"], [152, "TJie Mystery of the 144 of modesty, but he felt that the sight of Lord Brackelonde in or about the house at that particular moment would simply convert him (Roberts) into a hopeless idiot ; for in that case the individual on the box of the broug ham could be nothing else but a phantom \u2014 Roberts did not exactly use that word to himself, but that was what he meant \u2014 and all the ghost stories and legends at which he had sneered so often were, after all, true. He, however, dismissed the idea at once as being too preposterous. He began to review the events of the last few hours, trying to piece them together, but he suddenly checked himself. He would go to Lord Brackelonde's room first. He found the door wide open. Holding the letter in his hand, he wandered all over the house, even up to the first and second floors, though he knew the uselessness of the proceeding, for within his recollection Lord Brackelonde had never been so far but once, viz., on the previous day, when Lady Brackelonde sent word that she was too unwell to come down. He looked into the"], [153, "Patrician Club. 145 dining-room. There was no need to go into the library ; the night being warm the windows were thrown back, and from the garden terrace Roberts could perceive its only tenant, Mr. Greybridge. The excursion to the terrace was undertaken for a dual purpose ; first, to watch Mr. Greybridge's doings ; secondly, on the chance of finding Lord Brackelonde, who might be smoking out there, albeit that at that stage of his self imposed investigation Roberts felt convinced that Lord Brackelonde was not within nor anywhere near the precincts. But his Lord ship was not to be trifled with, and Roberts was always careful not to be caught napping. Having thus discharged his duty in every possible way, he placed the letter on the dressing table and repaired to the hall to resume the thread of his self-interrupted cogitation. He esconced himself comfortably in the beehive chair, and began to work out things bit by bit in a manner that would have done credit to a trained logician. If his Lordship had personated Wakeford on the VOL. II. l"], [154, "The Mystery of the 146 \\>ox of the brougham \u2014 and Roberts had little O doubt of that fact \u2014 it had, at any rate, been done with remarkable skill and in an incre dibly short time ; so short indeed as to beat the most marvellous performances in that respect of the most celebrated music-hall artists, nearly all of whom Roberts had seen. They, of course, had all their changes pre pared for them, and Roberts began to wonder whether this had not been the case also in this instance. The individual to whom he (Roberts) had transmitted Lady Mary's order to bring the carriage round must have been Wakeford or Wakeford's double. In the face of all he had seen the former supposition would not hold water for a moment, and with regard to the latter Wake ford was known to have neither brothers nor sisters, and if he had \u2014 here a not very pleasant smile played on Roberts's lips \u2014 they would not belike Wakeford. The individual to whom Roberts had spoken was the image of the head coachman himself. Of that Roberts was certain, notwithstanding the"], [155, "Patrician Club. 147 waning light in which he had seen him and the distance that separated them, for his interlocutor stood at the window of Wake ford's room on the floor over the stables, and he was in the stable yard. Up to that point Roberts succeeded in proving to his own satisfaction that the sup posititious Wakeford could have been none other than Lord Brackelonde himself, but all of a sudden he was confronted with a seemingly insuperable difficulty, which, unless overcome, would blow the whole of his previous fabric into the air. How and why was Lord Brackelonde in Wakeford's room at the very moment that he (Roberts) came to give him the order to bring the carriage round ? Why had Wakeford been ordered out twice that night on seemingly unimportant business\u2014 he who was rarely summoned except on special occasions ? There were at least three or four men to take his place. Roberts felt positive that not more than a quarter of an hour could have elapsed between his having knocked at hu Lordship's door to tell him about dinner L 2"], [156, "148 The Mystery of the and his having received Lady Mary's order for the brougham, and yet during those short fifteen minutes his Lordship had found time to transform himself to such an extent as to deceive him (Roberts), to shave off his mag nificent beard, unless \u2014 here Roberts stopped for another moment \u2014 unless the beard was already gone when he knocked at the door. Was that the reason of the door being locked ? Roberts had got thus far with his medita tions when a maid came to tell him that the library bell had rung for him. It was then that Mr. Greybridge told him to watch for the brougham's return from the front terrace. After that, cudgel his brains as he might, he did not advance one step towards the solu tion of the mystery, which, if anything, became more dark to him by the appearance of Lady Mary and Richard on foot and their suppressed though to him visible excitement. But there was a mystery, and that was suffi cient for him. He felt prepared for anything and everything. His outwardly calm"], [157, "Patrician Club. 149 demeanour when summoned to Lady Mary's presence was the result of that prepara tion. His calmness, however, did not impose upon Lady Mary. With her instinctive mistrust of him she took it for what it was worth, and his first words in answer to her question showed her that her instinct did not deceive her. \" To whom did you give the order to bring the brougham round ? \" she asked. \" To Wakeford, my lady,\" was the reply \"Where was Wakeford when you told him?\" \" In his own room ; he answered me through the window.\" \" What clothes did he wear ? \" \" He was in his shirt sleeves, my lady Lady Mary looked him straight in the face. \" Did it not strike you when Wakeford handed you a letter from Lord Clynchland, which he brought from the Priory, that it could not have been Wakeford who brought the brougham round and took it to Stan coombe ? \""], [158, "The Mystery of the 150 Roberts felt that he was being driven into a corner, and, but for his knowledge of the girl facing him, would have turned insolent there and then. It is the only resource of the habitual spy and eavesdropper when at bay. As it was, he simply said, \" It did strike me, my lady.\" \" Then why did you not remark upon it to Wakeford himself, or, if you did not wish to do that, why didn't you tell someone ? \" \" I did not think it was my business to do so, my lady. Besides, Wakeford said the letter he brought was important and should be delivered immediately. I went all over the house to find his Lordship. I would have told him.\" Roberts was under the impression that he was playing an exceedingly clever game. Without having said it in so many words, he was giving Lady Mary to understand that he was responsible to no one but Lord Bracke londe, and that at the same time he was aware of his disappearance. His own cunning told him that the personation of"], [159, "Patrician Club. 151 Wakeford by Lord Brackelonde had not been prompted by a mere whim, but by urgent necessity. That necessity argued a mystery which truly he had not fathomed, but Lady Mary might not be aware of that and be pre pared to pay hush-money at once, only for the mere suppression of the fact of her father's disappearance. He had waited and plotted and schemed for many years ; he was perhaps on the eve of the realization of his dream \u2014 a big lump sum, which, in addition to his savings, might open the gates of his paradise to him, the betting ring. He had, however, found his match. Richard was right when he said that the girl had inherited part of her father's craft. One searching glance at the table for Lord Clynchland's letter, an almost im perceptible touch of her pocket to ascertain that it was safe within its folds, and then she spoke, not taking her eyes off Roberts's face. \" Then why did you not find his Lordship? \" she said. The question fairly took Roberts' breath"], [160, "The Mystery of the 152 away. His eyes wandered helplessly from Mr. Greybridge to Richard, and from Richard to Lady Mary ; but the latter had effectually forestalled all expressions of astonishmentfrom the other two by an instantaneous raising of the eyebrows and a flash from the eyes. The two men sat perfectly stolid. Roberts hesitated for a moment ; he was by no means a despicable adversary. During that moment he asked himself whether Lady Mary was really ignorant of her father's disappearance and his personation of Wakeford, or whether she merely pretended to be. Lord Bracke londe might after all have occupied the box of the brougham and returned with it from Stancoombe unsuspected by any of these three. His Lordship might have chosen to enact the spy for reasons of his own connected with the mystery which Roberts felt to be hanging over the place, but which, do what he would, he failed to penetrate. He might be in the house at that very moment, for owing to Lady Mary's precaution, Roberts had missed satisfying his curiosity with"], [161, "Patrician Club. 153 regard to the driver of the carriage. Roberts saw no way out of the difficulty except by taking the bull by the horns. He might miss his coup, but he would chance it. \"Your ladyship knows very well that I could not find his Lordship, because his Lordship took Wakeford's \" The sentence was left unfinished, for all of a sudden there was the sound of a violent altercation in the hall, and when Richard opened the door of the library to ascertain the cause, he found Carfield, the hall porter, barring the way to an individual who turned out to be Ephraim Masters. \" I tell you that I must and will see Lady Mary,\" said the former landlord of the Brackelonde Arms. \" Never mind the hour ; her ladyship will not mind it either. You don't suppose that I would disturb her for a mere trifle ? I shan't stir from here until you have told her.\" Richard saw at once that Ephraim was not quite sober. His face was flushed and his voice thick, but he was perfectly steady"], [162, "The Mystery of the 154 on his legs and absolutely conscious of what he was doing. \" It is very late, Mr. Masters, and Lady Mary has only got home from Stancoombe just now ; she is tired,\" he said, stepping forward. \" Can't I give your message?\" \" No, Mr. Richard ; I must see her myself,\" replied Masters, respectfully, and taking off his hat, for everyone in the neighbourhood liked Richard, and Masters was no exception. The danger of parleying before Carfield, and possibly within earshot of Roberts, was obvious \u2014 the door of the library was open, \u2014 so Richard decided upon the most sensible course at once. \" Very well, then. Carfield, take Mr. Masters into the dining-room. I will tell Lady Mary \" \u2014 this to Masters, \u2014 \" and she will be with you directly.\" Richard did not leave the hall until he had seen the dining-room door fairly closed upon Masters ; then he made his way back to the library. Roberts was still standing in the middle of the apartment, but not a syllable"], [163, "Patrician Club. 155 had been exchanged between him and Lady Mary since the sound of voices in the hall had fallen upon their ears. In fact, all three had been too anxious to ascertain the cause of the interruption to concentrate their atten tion on the solution of the enigma which they felt instinctively was going to be solved by the new-comer. The cessation of the voices in the hall was therefore a disappointment to all ; to no one more than to Roberts, who began to foresee the frustration of his scheme. The big lump sum he had beheld in his imagination was fast dwindling to infinitesi mal proportions \u2014 to a month's salary and board wages in lieu of notice. The example of Lady Mary's diplomatic fencing with Roberts had evidently inspired Richard, for, instead of telling her outright that Masters insisted on seeing her on important business, which message at that late hour would have inevitably increased the suspicions of the astute valet, he bethought himself of leading Roberts off the scent. \" Your father has seemingly met with an"], [164, "156 The Mystery of the accident,\" he said quietly, giving her at the same time a sign perceptible to no one but herself. \"It's nothing very serious, but there is someone who wishes to see you at once. You had better speak to Roberts in the morning.\" She understood at once that Richard wanted to get rid of Roberts, though she had failed to recognize Masters' voice. Roberts, on the other hand, was equally anxious to get a glimpse of the visitor, and was backing out of the room when Richard stopped him. \" One moment, Roberts,\" he said. \" With her ladyship's permission, I will take you to your room, where it would be well for you to stay until you are sent for. In your own in terest I would advise you to say nothing about your own fanciful suspicions to anyone. Come along with me.\" There was a look on Roberts's face that betokened revolt, but a steady gaze from Richard had the desired effect, and he pre ceded him meekly out of the room. Richard did not waste many words on"], [165, "Patrician Club. 157 Roberts, and almost immediately returned from the basement, just as Lady Mary, fol lowed by Mr. Greybridge, was entering the dining-room. They found Ephraim Masters standing by the side of the table where Carfield had left him. He was perfectly sober now, but there was a stern, dogged expression on his features that boded little good to those before him. At Lady Mary's sign to be seated he shook his head, but his features relaxed. \" It would not be right to sit down in the house of an enemy, my lady,\" he said, in a firm but low voice, \" and your father is my enemy ; but I bear no ill-will to his daughter and his family, and it is to prove it that I am here.\" Lady Mary felt that a crisis was at hand, but she remained perfectly calm. \"I do not understand you, Mr. Masters ; but will you explain ? \" \" I will try to do so, my lady.

And yet the realization of their worst fears left them mentally prostrate and utterly at a loss how to carry out the advice of Ephraim Masters, albeit that the advice but prescribed the accelerated carrying out of their own plans.

As usual, Lady Mary was the first to recover her presence of mind. \" Masters knows more than he cares to divulge,\" she said very slowly. \" Esther must be removed at once. We are safe for this morning, pro vided we keep the Sunday papers out of the way, though it is doubtful whether they will get the news of his capture in time.

The mute glance revealed a world of trust and love which stirred every generous fibre in the young fellow's heart. For an other's sake she was now imploring the sacrifice she had so stoutly refused but a few hours since.

They sat for many hours discussing things, and among these the safest and most expeditious way of getting rid of Roberts. They were at a loss how to deal with him. They reason ably surmised that so wary a hand as Lord Brackelonde would not have risked taking him into his confidence ; consequently that he (Roberts) was ignorant of the cause of Lord Brackelonde's flight ; but beyond that they could take nothing for granted. The principal contingency they had to guard against was his communicating, first with Lady Brackelonde herself; secondly, with his fellow-servants ; but his summary dis missal even with a handsome cheque as a gratification would afford no guarantee as to his silence, for however large the amount, it"], [171, "Patrician Club. 163 would not realize Roberts' expectations. Besides, Mr. Greybridge, though generosity itself, felt altogether reluctant to pander to Roberts' greed. Moreover, his going under such conditions would not only arouse the curiosity of the rest of the household, but would pave the way for further exactions on his part. They did not delude themselves into the belief that Roberts had been taken in by the story of Lord Brackelonde's acci dent, but Richard suggested that the fiction should be kept up as a means of restricting Roberts's movements, at any rate for the next forty-eight hours. It was impossible to fore see the evolution of the drama for which they had been involuntarily cast during that period. If they could impress Roberts with the fact that his reward would be entirely dependent upon his discretion, then there might be a chance of Lady Brackelonde's removal being effected without an alarm being raised in her mind.

In another moment the sound came, and the two men, instinctively feeling that the sur prises of the night were not over yet, turned in the direction of the gateway. A riderless horse was standing by its side. In another instant they recognized Swiftfly. There could be no mistaking her. There was Mr. Greybridge's saddle on her back ; but from one of her stirrups there dangled a boot which seemed ripped open from heel to top. The two men stood speechless and looking at one another. Lord Brackelonde was too good a horseman to be easily thrown. \" He has met with an accident, perhaps been killed,\" suggested Mr. Greybridge at last. Richard shook his head. \" He was alive"], [177, "Patrician Club. 169 and well when he did this,\" he smiled, point ing to the boot. \" How do you know he did it himself?\" \" No one else could have done it ; it's a trick worthy of a circus rider.

He quickly confiscated the damaged boot and made it into the smallest possible parcel, which he eventually stowed in his dress ing bag ; but the unexpected return of Lord Brackelonde's favourite mare he used as a trump card in his interview with Roberts a few hours later on. He took care that Roberts should be fully cognizant of that return, though of course not of the manner in which it had been effected. When sum moned to the stables at about half-past six by Mr. Greybridge himself, Roberts, to his great surprise, found himself in the presence of Swiftfly, apparently just brought back by Richard, who proceeded to give him a cir cumstantial account of his master's condition, which, according to his informant, was not so serious physically as mentally. In fact, Richard gave Roberts to understand inferen tially that Lord Brackelonde's mind had suddenly become unhinged, and that it was this sudden access of mental aberration which had led to the whimsical impersonation of"], [179, "Patrician Club. 171 Wakeford and the consequent accident. Richard's tone to Roberts had altogether changed ; instead of being mistrustful and peremptory, it had become confiding and conciliating, and he wound up with \" This is a terrible calamity, Roberts, which should be kept a secret if possible, for it may, after all, be temporary.\" And Roberts, astute as he was, believed the story. He had heard and read of people being suddenly seized with the mania of personation. Whether in this instance the mania was without a cause he felt unable to determine, and he promised himself to find it out if he could. But out wardly he was very docile and tractable, and pledged his word to preserve a rigorous silence towards everybody. Wakeford was scarcely less astonished than Roberts, but accepted Richard's account of the events of the previous night more unreservedly than Lord Brackelonde's valet. He was a less worldly but better-informed man than the latter, and Lord Brackelonde's deep-laid plot to get him (Wakeford) out of"], [180, "The Mystery of the 172 the way in order to take his place tallied so completely with the well-ascertained pro ceedings of the monomaniac that the head coachman did not hesitate to place implicit faith in Richard's version. There was, more over, a blood relationship \u2014 though unac knowledged \u2014 between him and Lord Bracke londe, which went far to ensure Wakeford's silence, apart from the obligation he felt to betray no secret of the family whose bread he ate. On that side everything was safe. As for Lady Brackelonde, the prospect of leaving the Dene for some considerable time, held out by Lady Mary first and subse quently by Richard and Mr. Greybridge, was too tempting to meet with serious opposition on her part. She was vaguely conscious that the accusation brought by her husband against Captain Edmundsbury would not remain altogether hidden from the outer world, but felt at the same time profoundly convinced that the latter would be able to clear himself. As for the graver charges formulated by Lord Brackelonde, she im-"], [181, "Patrician Club. 173 plicitly believed her stepdaughter's state ment that it had been prompted by sheer vindictiveness, and that the real murderer had been found. Base as she knew the man to be whose name she bore, she failed to con nect him with so heinous a crime ; nay, she had no suspicion that he himself was the cheat. She was inclined to look upon the whole as one of those scandals that occur now and then in club life ; as one of those scandals to which she had heard her brother allude, but which in this instance had been magnified by Lord Brackelonde for his own purposes. She even helped to prepare for the journey, and when the train that was to carry them to town drew up at the Stancoombe platform she felt more cheerful than she had felt for many months. Nevertheless it was with a heavy heart that Richard took his seat in the railway carriage, but there was no sign of depression outwardly. He knew but too well that the faintest sign would cause Lady Mary's with drawal from the compact ; that under the"], [182, "The Mystery of the 174 circumstances the compact would never be renewed ; and rather than face the prospect of giving her up for ever, he was preparing for anything and everything, even for the terrible despair of his mother, if not of his father, which he felt to be impending. Not for one moment did he expect the final issue to be averted. To him the eventual appre hension of Lord Brackelonde, his trial and conviction, either in the criminal courts or by a jury of his peers, were foregone conclusions ; first of all, in virtue of his implicit faith in Jasper Davenport's marvellous detective skill; secondly, in virtue of his unalterable belief that inexorable Fate, as the Greeks call it, or Providence, according to the moderns, was fighting on Jasper Davenport's side. Swiftfly's appearance that morning had, however, inspired him with the hope of a shorter or longer respite, and of that he would take advantage to soften the blow to his mother. Though the Clynboroughs were by no means slaves to the laws of etiquette, Richard felt that the regard due to his"], [183, "Patrician Club. 175 mother, as well as to Lady Brackelonde and Lady Mary, forbade the latter's unannounced arrival at Park Lane without some plausible pretext. Tax his ingenuity as he might, he failed to find one. The announcement of his hurried marriage would have the effect of arousing Lady Clovelly's suspicions, and, above all, her objections, even if he succeeded in making her believe Lord Brackelonde's opposition to it as he had succeeded in making Lady Brackelonde believe it, for Lady Clovelly's pride would revolt at the idea of her favourite son entering upon a union with a family against the wishes of its head, apart from her mental and moral repug nance to, and fear of, that head. In short, Richard was beside himself with anxiety, for this time he felt inadequate to the battle. There was, on the one hand, his mother ; on the other, Lady Brackelonde. Both had to be spared, and he had no one to help him. They had nearly got to Ashford before he made up his mind what to do. Then he took a sheet of paper from his bag and wrote"], [184, "176 The Mystery of the a telegram to his father, which he handed to the guard. It merely said : \u2014 \" Mary, Esther, and I reach Charing Cross at 2.15. Come and meet train. Very important.\" Lord Clovelly knew his sons too well to think them capable of disturbing him for a mere trifle, so that even if Richard had not added the last words to his message he would have been prepared for something serious. A glance from his son as he stepped from the carriage, leaving the women to the care of Mr. Greybridge for the moment, told him the matter was still more serious than he had expected. But the one sentence from Richard as he took him aside fairly staggered him. \" The police are after Lord Bracke londe for the murder of Gustave Dubois, father,\" said the young fellow, hurriedly and in an undertone. Then seeing Lord Clovelly turn livid, he added, \" For Heaven's sake show no surprise. Mary and Mr. Grey bridge know all about it ; Esther does not. Do not breathe a word. The cur nearly"], [185, "Patrician Club. 177 killed her on Friday by telling her it was Jack who murdered the waiter. The least excitement may drive her mad.\" The colour slowly returned to Lord Clo velly's face, and in another minute he asked quietly, \" What do you wish me to do ? \" \" Ask her and Mary to come to Park Lane. That's all at present. I'll tell you everything when we get home.\" In spite of the shock, it was clear to Lord Clovelly that there was neither time for reflection nor discussion, so without another syllable he stepped up to the group. \" Richard thinks you had better all come to Park Lane,\" he said, shaking hands with Lady Brackelonde and Mary. Then turning to the banker, \" We shall be pleased to put you up also, Mr. Greybridge.\" \" It's very kind of you, Lord Clovelly, but I shall have such a deal of business to trans act and so many people to receive to-morrow that I will ask you to excuse me. I will go to my old quarters,\" said Mr. Grey bridge. VOL. 11. n"], [186, "178 The Mystery of the \" But you will come home with us now and have luncheon ? \" \"With pleasure.\" \"Then you had better go on, father,\" said Richard ; \" and Sharp and I will look after the luggage.\" Richard was fairly astonished at his own skill at staving off awkward questions, for he felt that the sight of three or four huge trunks and an equal number of bags would have led to inquiries on his father's part which he was not prepared to answer offhand. He wished, however, to avoid arousing the curiosity of his mother. With the aid of Sharp, who had been selected in preference to Lady Bracke londe's maid, and a porter he managed to deposit the bulkier portion of the luggage in the cloak-room \u2014 Mr. Greybridge had taken his own small portmanteau \u2014 and to reach Park Lane with just what was necessary for the next twenty-four hours. He dreaded to speculate upon events beyond that period ; as it was, he felt barely safe until then. He had been obliged to forego buying the Sunday papers"], [187, "Patrician Club. 179 at Ashford, though he knew from a glance at the contents bills that they were full of the murder. In fact, on the pretext of handing the guard his telegram he had purposely blocked up the window lest Lady Bracke londe should catch sight of the startling headlines ; but he felt sure that no arrest had been effected : at least up till two that morning, for he had looked eagerly for the word or its synonym, and, to his great relief, not found it. That Lord Brackelonde was sorely pressed by his pursuers when he abandoned Swiftfly was but too evident from the boot left dangling in the stirrup. He had little or no difficulty in guessing the strait that had prompted that expedient, and though he con cluded that it had succeeded once, he cherished no hope with regard to the success of subse quent exploits, however daring. In short, he had but a few hours to prepare for the worst. He felt intensely relieved when, on reaching Park Lane, Dawson told him that luncheon was on the table. It was so much time N 2"], [188, "180 The Mystery of the gained, and in the jauntiest manner possible he made his way to the dining-room, kissed his mother, and, carefully avoiding looking at his father, began to ply his knife and fork vigorously. He could not help comparing his present situation with that of the previous Thursday night, when a foreboding of evil had caused him to watch his father's every movement. He could not help reflecting upon the strange freak of fate which had, as it were, singled out himself and his family to deal the terrible blow to the woman he now felt confident of loving better than any other on earth. For there was no doubt in his mind that but for the summoning of Jasper Daven port by his father and brothers, Lord Bracke londe's guilt would have remained undis covered and the crime have gone unpunished. As will be seen shortly, this was not quite the case ; but Richard was as yet not aware of the sudden appearance upon the scene of Gustave Dubois' successor at The Plungers, Johann Muller. The outcome of this reflec tion only served to fortify his determination"], [189, "Patrician Club. 181 to marry Mary come what might, though as the time drew near for this decision to be communicated to his father he inwardly shuddered at the contemplation of the con sequences. It was a lovely summer's day, and Lady Eva Clynborough and her guest, Eva Edmundsbury, both of whom had been kept in ignorance of even the minor phases of the drama which was being enacted, had already planned a drive and various calls in honour of the newcomers, plans which were at once knocked on the head by Richard's declaring that Lady Brackelonde was under his special care and that her state of health admitted neither of exertion nor excitement. Lady Mary proved his clever ally by suggesting to her stepmother that she should lie down for an hour or so in her room while she (Mary) read to her. Both Mary and Richard felt like the tenant of the \"condemned cell \" at Newgate who no longer reckons the flight of time by weeks and days, but by hours and minutes. Richard was loyal in word and"], [190, "182 The Mystery of the deed, but even a far less noble disposition than the girl's could not have failed to guess the mental terror with which the impending interview with his father inspired him. The comparison with the feeling of the tenant of the \" condemned cell \" was no mere metaphor. Richard kept watching the hands of the clock, which to him seemed to move with amazing swiftness. On the Thursday night he was anxiously awaiting the termination of the dinner, at present he would have given any thing to prolong the luncheon indefinitely. \" I have done with time now for eternity,\" said Lord William Russell, winding his watch after he had been condemned to death. Richard would have liked to wind his watch and to have remained seated at the table till the Day of Judgment. His father seemed at last to come to his aid in deferring the ex planations. \" It's a very long time since we met,\" he said, turning to Mr. Greybridge ; \"and if you have no other engagement we'll smoke our"], [191, "Patrician Club. 183 cigars in the library. Unless you are going out, Dick, you had better come too.\" In another moment they entered the library, but before they were fairly seated and had lighted their cigars Dawson knocked at the door. \" Mr. Jasper Davenport wishes to know if your Lordship would see him,\" he said. \"Ask Mr. Davenport to step in here,\" was the reply. Then when the butler was gone Lord Clovelly turned to his son. \" This is probably the news of his arrest, Dick,\" he murmured, holding out his hand, which the young fellow grasped in silence. \" Poor Mary ! Poor Esther ! \" he went on, the tears starting to his eyes. He did not add \" Poor Dick,\" and Richard noticed the omission. It simply showed that his father had not the least idea of what was coming, and it made Richard's task the more difficult."], [192, "CHAPTER IX. Davenport was outwardly as calm and col lected as when he entered that same room for the first time ; he even showed little or no surprise at seeing his old friend, Mr. Grey bridge, rise from his chair to shake hands with him. But both Richard and the banker noticed that he looked haggard and care worn, that there was a cruel line about the mouth which boded ill for the success of those who would thwart him in his stern, fell pur pose of running his enemy to earth. Lord Clovelly also rose and shook him warmly by the hand, for he was too generous to blame Davenport for the trouble he had brought upon Lady Mary and Lady Bracke londe in his endeavours to free his godson from the terrible charge and the suspicion of a still more terrible one hanging over his head,"], [193, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 185 and at that particular moment Lord Clovelly's knowledge of affairs extended no further than that. \" According to my promise of yesterday morning, my Lord, I have come to report progress ; but I fancy my news in one respect has been forestalled, and I fear it's not of a particularly pleasant nature.

But it was not a mere act of disinterested friendliness on his part. He made it a condition that Muller should pay him a commission on his first year's salary. No registry office would have charged Muller more than he did, and a good many would have charged less. That alone would show the character of Dubois, even if we had not the statement of his uncle at the inquest that he was an inveterate money-grubber. Johann Muller paid the money, ' but,' as he remarked to me, ' it stuck in my throat. I like money as well as Gustave Dubois did, but I am not a miser. I have an old mother to keep in Germany.' I am unable to say whether Johann Muller felt a grudge against Gustave Dubois for his meanness, but he kept on ap parent terms of friendship with him ; only he seems to have made up his mind if Dubois ever wanted a favour of him, to make him pay for it as Dubois had made him pay. It"], [197, "Patrician Club. 189 would appear, however, that Muller did not get his chance for a long while ; in fact, not until the day after the scene in the card-room at the Patrician, when he received a letter from Gustave Dubois.

Your friend, Gustave.' \" Though no eagle, Johann Muller is by no means a fool, and he felt that there was some thing not quite aboveboard in all this. But the real meaning of it he was unable to make out for several hours after the receipt of the letter, which came last Friday a fortnight ago. Of one thing he felt, however, certain \u2014 Gustave did not want the cards as patterns. If the members of the Patrician were dissatis-"], [198, "The Mystery of the 190 fied with the cards in use and the secretary had made up his mind to change the supply, nothing would have been easier than to write for a book of patterns to the makers he inten ded to patronize. Gustave Dubois had been too clever for once, but the more Muller puzzled to get at the true significance of the request the less he succeeded. Curiously enough, he remembered the patterns Gustave pretended to want perfectly well, and yet, do what he would, he could not find them among the cards that had been used the night before, nor among the new packs in the case he had in his charge. Neverthe less, he could have sworn that he had seen the designs within the last twenty-four hours, but where and under what circumstances he failed to remember. Then the circumstances suddenly flashed upon him. Lord Brackelonde had come in late on the night before and asked him for two packs of cards, saying that he was going to the country early next morn ing and wanted to take them with him, as he had run out of his stock and could not get"], [199, "Patrician Club. 191 any decent ones near his home. The particu lars of the whole affair came back to him ; and then he recollected that, instead of putting them in his pocket intact, as might have been expected, seeing that they were intended for future use, Lord Bracke londe sat down in the smaller inner card room, where no one happened to be at that moment, tore off the wrappers of both packs, and began to examine the cards themselves very attentively. But he saw no more than that, and that only imperfectly, because he was engaged in the other room. He felt no doubt, however, about the wrappers having been undone, for he noticed them afterwards lying under the table. Gradually another strange fact obtruded itself on his recollection. About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Lord Brackelonde's request for the cards he (Johann) was standing at the open window of the card-room \u2014 the night being warm, \u2014 when he saw Lord Brackelonde cross the road and enter the Patrician, the entrance to which is almost opposite the Plungers. He"], [200, "The Mystery of the 192 did not pay much attention to this at the time, but he now began to ask himself several questions. Lord Brackelonde, though a well- known member of the Plungers, was by no means so often seen there as at the Patrician. This he knew from personal observation. Why, then, should he have asked him for two packs of cards, alleging that he was in a hurry, when almost immediately afterwards he went to his usual club, where it would have been just as easy for him to get them ? In short, Muller became more and more con- vinced that there was something queer in all this, though he was absolutely unable to put his suspicions into shape. Nor could he comply with Gustave Dubois' request to send him those two particular patterns of cards, for the simple reason that he could find none. He, however, sent him two patterns which were so curiously like those Gustave wanted that the most practised eye could have scarcely detected the difference without comparison. Muller did not draw attention to the differ ence. They were 'jokers' \u2014 your Lordship"], [201, "Patrician Club. 193 knows what I mean, \u2014 but their comic or devil's heads which justify their name in America were wanting. They were blank on one side. I have the four cards with me, and if you like, we will compare them to show you that the difference is difficult to establish.\" Saying which, and not noticing the look of surprise of his three listeners, Davenport took from his pocket an envelope containing four cards. \" These,\" he said, carefully selecting a couple with an elastic band round them, \"are the cards sent by Johann Muller to Gustave Dubois ; the other two will be found to correspond with the two packs Lord Brackelonde substituted under cover of mo mentary darkness in order to convict Captain Edmundsbury of cheating.\" Then, turning to Lord Clovelly, \" You remember telling me, my Lord, that all the cards were impounded and wrapt up in a newspaper and hand kerchief. When the seal of that parcel is broken next Thursday the bubble will burst, even if the murderer of Gustave Dubois be still at large, which is not likely, seeing that vol. 11. o"], [202, "The Mystery of the 194 every minute I expect to hear news of his arrest.

We are unfortunately as much interested now in the one phase of the affair as in the other,\" he said. \" But pardon me for interrupting yTou.\" \" These cards,\" Davenport went on, point ing to the couple lying loose on the table, \"are the 'jokers' of the packs that were obtained from Johann Muller, and it will not be difficult to prove that they are of an entirely different make to those in use at the Patrician Club. The maker's name is on the aces, I believe. Furthermore, the secretary of the Plungers will, if needs be, come forward, though I have not broached a word of it as yet, and prove, with Johann' s book in hand, the sale of two packs of cards ; and be it remembered that Captain Edmundsbury is not a member of the Plungers.

There was no mistaking the bitterness of the tone as well as the exultant air with which the words were uttered. They were in such perfect contrast with Davenport's attitude throughout the former interviews. Davenport could not help noticing the look, and forthwith the explanation came. \" A general, my Lord, however great, does not win two battles with the self-same tactics ; an actor, however talented, does not enact the same part twice in the self-same manner. You are surprised, my Lord, at the tone I am adopting ; you detect a dominant note of personal revenge in it, and your ear has not deceived you.

But tell me, if it be not a professional secret, how did you become possessed of these four cards, and in so short a time, too ? It seems very wonderful.\" \" It is not so wonderful as you imagine, my Lord. The two 'jokers ' that are so curiously like those belonging to the packs purchased by Lord Brackelonde, I found in Gustave Dubois' room. The 'jokers' that really belong to the packs I had from Johann Muller himself, who, if necessary, will give evidence as to the manner in which he became possessed of them. But I can anticipate his evidence, which I had, as it were, to wring from him by a threat of immediate arrest. When you have heard the story you will be in a position to construct for yourself the prologue to the murder of Gustave Dubois.\""], [205, "Patrician Club. 197 Jasper Davenport had abandoned his favourite attitude. He was comfortably en sconed in his armchair, smoking his cigar ; his eyebrows enjoyed a period of rest, which was a sure sign that his mind was perfectly clear as to what he was going to say. \" My experience has taught me, my Lord,\" he began, \" that in crime, as in other things, there are born geniuses, who at their first attempts produced a masterpiece. Of such was La cenaire, of whom you have heard, who with out a moment's hesitation plunged a dagger into a stranger's breast, robbed him of all his valuables, lifted the body over the railings of the bridge at a considerable expenditure of strength, and flung it into the river. A bungler would have simply left it where it fell and courted inquiry. On the other hand there are criminals who require many years of apprenticeship before they become perfect. Gustave Dubois had the making of a criminal of genius in him. His first stroke of black mailing, as far as we know, would have made him independent for life if he had been"], [206, "The Mystery of the 198 allowed to live, and with any other victim but Frederick Stalforth he would have been allowed to live. Excuse this little preface ; you will see what I mean by it directly. Gustave Dubois may or may not have been in the room when Lord Brackelonde rose from his seat and accused Captain Edmunds bury of playing with marked cards. But if he was not in the room, he was very near. He had probably helped to relight the candles when the candelabrum fell or was pushed off the table ; and he certainly as sisted in picking up the incriminated cards, for he then detected that the patterns on their backs were not the patterns in use at the Patrician, but the patterns with which he had been familiar during his service at the Plungers. He must immediately have come to the conclusion that the cheat was not Captain Edmundsbury, but Lord Brackelonde, for he could not but have been aware that the latter was a member of the Plungers and the former was not. Of course an inexorable logician would object that the assumption of"], [207, "Patrician Club. 199 this theory on my part argued a keenness of vision and observation and a power of deduction on Gustave Dubois's part not warranted by known previous facts about him, but Gustave Dubois' letter to Johann Muller almost immediately afterwards goes a great way in favour of my theory, and if further proof were wanted of Gustave Dubois' suspicions with regard to Lord Brackelonde's real position in the affair, it would be forthcoming in his (Dubois') journey to Brackelonde Dene on the following Sunday \u2014 that is, two days after the scene ; con sequently at the first opportunity he could get for doing so.\" This time neither Mr. Greybridge nor Richard could refrain from giving vent to their surprise and admiration. \" How did you get to know of that journey ? \" they asked in one breath, forgetting Davenport's professional experience. He would probably have answered them, but for Lord Clovelly's question addressed to them. \" Did Dubois go to the Dene ? \" he asked."], [208, "The Mystery of the 200 \" Yes,\" answered both the men. \"Then you are very wonderful, Mr. Davenport,\" said Lord Clovelly. \" Not at all, my Lord. I know my business a little better perhaps than most English detectives because I do not neglect small things, but there is nothing wonderful in my discovery of Dubois' journey to Bracke londe Dene. If you will allow me, I'll return to Muller and show you how he became mixed up with the thing and how he got possession of the two real 'jokers,' by means of which he tried to force Dubois into giving him a share of the spoil. \"Your Lordship has already been told that Muller mistrusted Dubois' motives, but that, nevertheless, he sent him two pattern cards which were remarkably \u2014 nay, startlingly \u2014 like those he wanted. Muller, in spite of his suspicions of Dubois himself and his vague presentiment that Lord Brackelonde's strange behaviour had some connection with Dubois' request, argued in this way : ' If the patterns are for the purpose he pretends, those I am"], [209, "Patrician Club. 201 going to send him will do as well as the others, which, after all, I have not got. If, on the other hand, he wants them in connec tion with that purchase of the two packs of cards by Lord Brackelonde, he'll notice the difference and write again.' For, strange to say, these two young men, in spite of their acquaintance, in spite of their similar occupa tion, in spite of their proximity to one another, rarely met. \" It turned out as Muller expected. He had sent the two cards in a blank sheet of paper in an addressed envelope on the Saturday morning, and on the Sunday morn ing very early, in fact before Muller was out of bed, Dubois called at his lodgings. Muller would have been prepared for him in any case, but two things had happened almost immediately after he had despatched the envelope which made him particularly wary and careful. He had found the two 'jokers ' belonging to the packs he had given to Lord Brackelonde in a drawer of the little table at which his Lordship had been seated when he"], [210, "The Mystery of the 202 examined the cards, and not more than ten minutes after that discovery his Lordship himself sauntered into the room, made straight for the table, ' though with an air of indifference that would have deceived any one who was not on the watch,' to quote Muller's own words, casually opened the drawer, and peered into it. The wished-for pieces of paste-board were, however, safely in Muller's pocket, and his Lordship strolled out of the room as he had entered, ' as cool as an iceberg,' to use Muller's own words once more. \" Of course that settled the question in Muller's mind ; and Gustave's visit, the second he had ever paid him, at that early hour, only had the effect of making his suspicions a further certainty. We may, indeed, take it for granted that but for the invincible greed of that cunning individual Dubois he would not thus rashly have given himself away. As it was, he proceeded very cautiously. Unfortunately for him, Muller was forearmed at all points."], [211, "Patrician Club. 203 Dubois did not materially alter his story, but he confessed that his anxiety in the matter was owing to the large commission he would secure from the playing-card manufacturers for having procured them the custom of the Patrician. Muller did not believe a word of what Dubois said, but pretended to fall in with his views and to accept gratefully the promise of a third of the commission. But though Dubois hinted several times that he would like the exact designs he had described in his letter, Muller never broached a syllable of his having those designs in his possession. ' I fancy I remember them,' he remarked, ' and, as you observe, they are very elegant, but they are sure to be in the pattern-book, and then you can select them for yourself. But I'll have another look for them, and I'll let you know.' Dubois had to be satisfied with this, and went away as he came, minus the two \u2022 jokers.' \" After that Gustave kept worrying Muller to find the two 'jokers,' but the latter merely repeated that he had looked among the old"], [212, "The Mystery of the 204 packs without success. One morning, how ever, when Dubois had waylaid Muller for the third or fourth time that week, and was returning to the charge, the latter suddenly unmasked his batteries and told him that he pretty well knew what he wanted the ' jokers ' for, though at the same time he took great care to mention no name and not to admit that he had them in his possession. \"'They would fetch a pretty tidy sum from a certain member of the Patrician, wouldn't they, Gustave?' said Muller, 'but if I can manage to find them, I will sell them myself. Besides, I know a little story connected with them which is worth a hundred times as much as the pieces of cardboard themselves.' \" Gustave was fairly staggered. ' What do you know, Johann ? ' he gasped. ' That's my business,' answered Johann. ' I don't want to meddle with the affair mysefffor I don't want to find myself in prison for blackmailing; but if you make it worth my while I will tell it you, and then you can do with it what you like.' \" Gustave was very profuse with promises,"], [213, "Patrician Club. 205 but Muller would not be talked over. ' It won't do, my good friend,' he laughed ; ' I must see the money, and a lot too, lying in the palm of my hand before I say a word. If I were fool enough to believe in your promises, I would not get a cent, for I could not go to law, and short of that you wouldn't fork out.' Gustave swore that he had not had a farthing as yet, though that was a false hood, for he had already received fifty pounds ; but Muller remained obdurate. ' I don't care whether you have received a farthing or a million, but you will have to pay me hard cash before I open my lips. You have plenty of money in the bank ; take it out and invest it in the secret. I want a hundred and fifty pounds, not a penny less. You may get as much as you can ; I'll never ask you for another shilling.' That was the spirit if not the substance of Muller's words. He had taken up a certain position and would not budge an inch. \"Your Lordship has read the evidence of Dubois' uncle at the inquest, and may"], [214, "The Mystery of the 206 imagine the effect of Muller's ultimatum on the young Swiss, who shunned all comrade ship lest it should entail expense. Short of his life being at stake, Dubois would scarcely have parted with the fifty pounds he had already received, or even with a portion of it, and here he was asked to hand over not only that, but a hundred pounds of his savings besides. He could not and would not think of it, and determined to go to work for and by himself. Muller, on the other hand, is not only a moral and physical coward, but a careful coward \u2014 for there are cowards whose cowardice impels them to do rash things, \u2014 and he made up his mind to let matters rest, partly from fear, partly because he did not know how to use the secret of which he was possessed, and to a certain extent because he was reluctant to sully his hands, though he had not the least objection to Dubois doing so.

In another moment Daly appeared, and one glance at his face told Richard that there was another respite.

Daly merely nodded ; then he added slowly : \" Slipped away is not exactly the word ; disappeared, horse and all, as if swallowed up by the earth.\" There was a deep silence, broken at last by Lord Clovelly. \" You look tired and fagged, Mr. Daly ; have something to drink and tell us all about it.\" VOL.

The effect was electrical. The professional reticence and cautiousness of the man assumed the upper hand at once, and he closed his lips with a kind of snap as if to prevent his words from finding utterance. Then he stared with all his might at his superior to get his cue from him. But the latter, who was absolutely ignorant of Richard's share in the events of the previous night, failed to understand the meaning of his lieutenant's stare.

Daly's resentful tone was explained im mediately afterwards. \" I was nearly taken in by the trick,\" he said. \" What saved you, Daly ? \" asked Daven port, eagerly, the detective getting the mental upper hand of the erstwhile lieutenant thirst ing for revenge. \" The portrait ? \" Richard turned very white. \" No, Mr, Davenport, the portrait nearly did for me.

I am not telling tales out of school when I say that Mr. Davenport has not made many friends in our"], [222, "The Mystery of the 214 profession. Few of us dispute his cleverness ; but a good many think it a mixture of luck and cleverness. I myself was somewhat of that opinion until yesterday morning, when something occurred in the rooms of the young man who was murdered which fairly took the breath out of me. Perhaps Mr. Daven port will explain it one day ; at present I can only say that I have been converted. I no longer think that luck has anything to do with Mr. Davenport's success, and am not ashamed to own that I was wrong. Well, half an-hour after my conversation Mr. Davenport gave me instructions to watch and ride after a man whom he considered one of the best and hardest riders in England. He was not far wrong in saying so. I own I felt flattered by his show of confidence, and made up my mind to put my best foot forward, which, I may tell your Lordship, we do not always do when we help a colleague ' in whom we've got our knife,' as the saying is. ' That's the man you want,' said Mr. Daven port, giving me the portrait. ' At present he"], [223, "Patrician Club. 215 is wearing a long beard, but I feel sure he'll shave it off. Whether he does or not, this is the only portrait I can give you. There's no time to get another, so you must do the best you can.' He told me the name of the party after whom I was going and where I was to take up my quarters. I spoke of luck just now, my Lord ; it ill becomes us to sneer at luck. The cleverest of us, and I am not one, would do little enough without it. I had three separate bits of luck yesterday, and though my customer gave me the slip, there is no fear about my netting him in the end. The first bit of luck was the finding of a capital nag at one of my old messmates', who has set up as a riding master in the North of London ; the second was my getting a horsebox at a moment's notice at Charing Cross, and my spotting the very man I wanted five minutes before the train started. It was the beard did it, for he had not shaved it off then, though he did a few hours later. Such a beard as his is a godsend to a detec tive, but a curse to the man who is fool"], [224, "216 The Mystery of the enough to wear it under such circumstances. The third bit of luck was the most extra ordinary of all. In the course of our con versation Mr. Davenport had said, ' Look here, Daly. Kick up as little dust as possible, but if you happen to come across a man by the name of Ephraim Masters, get in with him. He is a native of the place, and knows every inch and corner of it.

He's not only bold enough but tricky enough for that. You will have the whole of Sunday and the greater part of Monday to explore your ground, for I am not ready and don't think it advisable to apply for a warrant until I am, and that won't be before Monday afternoon.

You had better put up at the Brackelonde Arms ; it's risky and may put him on his guard, but you can't help yourself; there's no other inn in the place.' \" Here Daly stopped for a moment to take breath and moisten his lips ; then went on : \" Now, the extraordinary bit of luck was this, my Lord. When I heard the name of Ephraim Masters I pricked up my ears. Masters is a common name enough, but Ephraim isn't, and the name of my former sergeant in the regiment of dragoons was Ephraim Masters. But I didn't mention a word to Mr. Davenport, and made my way to Brackelonde by the same train which, as I"], [226, "The Mystery of the 218 told your Lordship, took Lord Brackelonde. I got out at Stancoombe, as I had been told to do. Under the circumstances it was a mistake, because it drew Lord Brackelonde's attention to me and my horse ; but of course Mr. Davenport could not guess that his Lordship would be in the train with me. I would have gone further on, but it would have made a fuss, and I did not know how far the stations were apart. I noticed his Lordship looking out of the carriage while they were getting the horse out. I kept as much as possible out of sight, but I have no doubt he took stock of me and became suspicious. One can't help one's appearance, my Lord, and those smart writers in the papers are not altogether wrong in saying it is not difficult to single out a detective. What makes me so certain of his having become suspicious is that he sent out his decoy very shortly after his arrival at the Dene, if I am right in supposing that he walked the distance from Brackelonde Station to his place. I had only a small satchel containing a change"], [227, "Patrician Club. 219 of linen, a razor, and a brush and comb with me, and got very quickly over the seven or eight miles of ground ; and yet I hadn't been out of the saddle for more than twenty minutes or half-an-hour before the decoy came trot ting out at the big gates. But that half hour had been well spent, or, to speak by the card, my luck had served me well. The first man I ran against in the bar of the Brackelonde Arms was Ephraim Masters, and he turned out to be my old sergeant. I knew him at once in spite of the five-and-twenty years or so that had. gone by, for the trim, spare figure was the same, and the few wrinkles in the closely shaven face did not make much difference. Besides, I was, as it were, on the look out for him. He was very pleased to see me, which, to tell the truth, made it somewhat awkward for me, as he evidently was aware of my present occupation. In fact, he seemed to know all about me, while I didn't know whether I was dealing with a friend or an enemy of the man I had been sent to watch. True, Mr. Davenport had"], [228, "The Mystery of the 220 told me to get in with Ephraim Masters, but that didn't mean anything, for we get our information as often from a friendly quarter as from an unfriendly one ; and in my par ticular line of business, my Lord, which is pure and simple ' thief-taking,' the pal of the man you want is often of great assistance if you know how to work him. \" I very soon discovered where Masters got his information about me. It was from a fellow-soldier who had left the regiment about the same time I did, who had settled in Dover as a saddler and married a distant cousin of mine whom I have rarely seen, but who receives letters frequently from my brothers and sisters in the North of England, where we were all born and bred. That's where the awkward situation came in, my Lord, for I did not want to give myself away, and Masters, though very jolly and cordial, was rather pressing as to the reason of my visit to his neighbourhood, and would not be put off with such pretexts as I could think of on the spur of the moment. To tell your"], [229, "Patrician Club. 221 Lordship the truth, they were not clever pretexts ; a child would have seen through them. But even twenty minutes of severe cross-examining comes to an end. I had got Masters outside the Brackelonde Arms by that time, and was cudgelling my brain for something more plausible, when I saw come cantering down the big drive of the Dene the living likeness of the pencil sketch I had in my pocket \u2014 I mean Lord Brackelonde with his beard off. I was about to jump into the saddle\u2014 my nag was standing near by the sign-post \u2014 when I suddenly remembered Mr. Davenport's recommendation ' to kick up as little dust as possible.' To rush away like that in the midst of my conversation with my old sergeant would have kicked up a good deal of dust ; there could have been no two opinions upon that. So I stood still straining my eyes, which are very good, to the utmost. But strain them as I might the rider coming down the drive was Lord Brackelonde sure enough, and I felt in a sore predicament what to do.\""], [230, "The Mystery of the 222 Daly stopped once more and looked with a kind of benign smile at Lord Clovelly and Davenport. With the semi-educated and altogether uneducated, that kind of smile is generally the precursor of a compliment. It is the apology of the commonplace mind for saying something out of the common. The compliment followed hard upon the smile. \" I have heard it said, my Lord,\" stammered Daly, \" that a clever man is like one of those satchets women stick their handkerchiefs in \u2014 the scent sticks to everyone he comes in con tact with. I have not come in contact with many clever men, so I can't say if it is true ; but after I saw Mr. Davenport at work yesterday morning I felt a different man. ' Hard riding alone won't do it, Daly,' I said to myself while coming down in the train ; ' you'll have to think a bit too.' So after I had prevented myself from jumping into the saddle I began to think a bit, and felt sur prised at the amount of thinking you can do in a few moments. For a few moments thinking told me many things ; first, that"], [231, "Patrician Club. 223 Lord Brackelonde couldn't have changed his clothes and shaved his beard in the short time at his disposal ; secondly, that if my appear ance on the scene had given him the idea of escaping there and then, he need not have come back to the Dene at all. Then I began to look more carefully at the horse and rider that were coming fast towards me. Mr. Davenport had told me that Lord Bracke londe was one of the best and hardest riders in the country ; the man who was coming along was a fair horseman, but by no means one of the best. A look at the horse told me that it could be by no means the best Lord Brackelonde had in his stables, either for pace or staying ; and if Lord Brackelonde had a notion that there would be someone at his heels he would have selected a better. \" So I stood quite still, pretending to take very little or no notice, though I was puzzling over the likeness. But after all I made a mis take, for just as the rider got out of the gates I said in a casual way, ' That's Lord Bracke londe, isn't it?' I could have bitten my"], [232, "The Mystery of the 224 tongue for saying it, but it was too late. Masters gave me a long, inquisitive look. ' Do you know Lord Brackelonde ? ' he asked. I got deeper into the mire. ' I have seen him once or twice,' I said. ' But you can scarcely have seen him without his beard,' objected Masters. ' Then what made you think he had shaved it off; besides he had it this afternoon when you came down with him.' I had been fool enough to tell him that I and my nag came by train. \" After that Masters got confidential. ' That was Wakeford, the head coachman,' he said ; and then he told the story connected with the remarkable likeness. ' Dissipation and debauchery, systematic debauchery is in their blood,' he repeated bitterly, ' and this last Brackelonde \u2014 for let's hope he'll be the last \u2014 is worse than the whole lot that went before him.' So before he came to the tale of his own grievances against the present Lord I knew I was dealing with an enemy, not with a friend, of the party I wanted. But I was very careful for all that, and until he saw"], [233, "Patrician Club. 225 Lord Brackelonde himself on the box of the brougham I do not think Masters had a real idea of the business I was after. The moment he saw him, though, his face lighted up with a fiendish delight. ' That's him, Daly,' he hissed, ' that's the man you are after ; I know you are. The pitcher goes to the well till it breaks,' he chuckled. ' His time has come at last. You needn't hurry. He's taken the Stancoombe road. He can't turn to the right or left.' And he helped me into the saddle in an instant. How Lord Bracke londe came on the box, Mr. Clynborough will be able to tell you, for he and a lady were inside the carriage.\" Many a famous actor would have envied the silence that fell upon the room when Daly ceased speaking and gave Richard his cue. Lord Clovelly's pipe lay extinguished by his side; Davenport sat plucking his eyebrow ; the banker and the young fellow, though out wardly less excited than the others, drew a long breath. They had heard, as it were, the vol. 11. Q"], [234, "The Mystery of the 226 solution of Masters' parting sentence of the previous night. Lord Clovelly was the first to speak. \" I think you may safely tell us the rest, Dick,' he said. \" Mr. Daly was right.

He was thinking of Lady Mary's words : \" It is written that the children shall suffer for the sins of the parents.\" And here was the fulfilment of the sentence in the fourth generation, for he clung to the idea that, but for the likeness between Wakeford and Lord Brackelonde, and the attempted use of that likeness, the latter might have escaped. He could not free his mind from the dread that this new sin of Mary's father might prolong God's anger, and that her possible offspring might be racked and torn with anguish as she wras being torn and racked now. But"], [235, "Patrician Club. 227 noticing that Lord Clovelly, as well as Daven port and Daly, were anxiously awaiting his first words, he gave no utterance to his thoughts, but began his circumstantial account of the events of the previous night, ending with a description of Swiftfly's return, rider less, and with the one top boot dangling from the stirrup. Davenport had not taken his eyes off Richard during the whole of the time, but his face had undergone a remarkable change. It was no longer passive. His breath came thick and fast, his left hand kept constantly tugging at his eyebrow, and at the principal points of the story the cheeks became flushed and a kind of twitch played round the corners of his mouth. But at the mention of Swiftfly's return an ashen pallor overspread his features. He started from his chair as if moved by an electric shock, and before Daly could take up the thread of the tale where Richard had dropped it he stopped him with \" One moment, Daly ; I think I can tell you how you lost your man. When he got into the Q 2"], [236, "228 The Mystery of the saddle he did not take the road the carriage came, but went straight down the High Street and towards the railway station.\" \" That's right,\" said Daly, his mouth wide open with astonishment. \" Then he took the short cut to the bridge ? \" \" He must have done,\" replied the in spector, his astonishment on the increase, for he, of course, was not aware that Davenport was almost a native of the place. \" He must have done,\" repeated Daly, \"for I suddenly lost sight of him, but rode on till I came to the main turning. When I caught sight of him again I was half way down the turning and he was on the crest of the bridge. I suppose he was about two hundred yards ahead, but, as I have told his Lordship, my sight is very good, and it was a bright night. He and his horse made a picture against the clear sky. By the time I got to the spot where I had seen him he had disappeared once more from my view. But I did not mind that, for I could hear the ring of his"], [237, "Patrician Club. 229 horse's hoofs on the hard road to the left of me. And sure enough when I got down the slope and turned to the left he was there, but he had increased the distance between us. My nag, good as it was, couldn't keep up with his. I had pretty well foreseen this when I noticed the horse in the shafts of the brougham. It was not a fair match,\" added the inspector, somewhat sulkily, and Daven port held up his hand. \" Of course it wasn't,\" he remarked, soothingly, for he had recovered his wonted composure, and the smile was placid and kind. \"So he was virtually going back in the direction from which you had started, with this difference, that you had the station on your left ? \" Daly merely nodded. His astonishment had ceased to show itself in his face, and when Davenport made the remark, \" I fancy I know the rest,\" he muttered in reply, \" I shouldn't wonder but what you do know.\" Davenport smiled once more, and said pointedly, \" There's one thing I do not know, Daly, and your answer will materially help"], [238, "The Mystery of the 230 me.

His chief had coaxed him into a good temper ; seeing which the latter continued : \" Tell me exactly when you ceased to hear the ring of his horse's hoofs on the road.\" Daly looked puzzled. \" That's just it,\" he said slowly. \" I have been trying to re member ever since, and I have got no further. I have nothing to go by but my own sense of hearing, and if I am to go by it I should say that I heard the sound until about half a minute of the time I pulled up myself.

Davenport sat lost in thought, as it were ; then he suddenly turned to Mr. Greybridge. \" How far is the station from St. Olaves? \" he asked. \" Two miles and a quarter, all but a few yards,\" was the answer. \" The turning leading to the bridge is about three or four hundred yards before you come to the station ? \" \" Yes,\" replied the banker, becoming interested in Davenport's calculations and vaguely speculating as to their results. \" Consequently,\" Davenport went on, ad-"], [241, "Patrician Club. 233 dressing Daly this time, \" you must have stopped on the other bank of the river almost opposite St. Olaves, for both the river and the road alongside it run pretty straight there.

In fact, just before the closing words of the interview Richard had seriously contemplated stealing away and summoning Lady Mary to appeal personally to Davenport's pity, but a suggestion to that effect whispered in the softest tones to Mr. Greybridge had met with a silent but most emphatic negative. Accom panied by his satellite, Davenport left the room without another syllable, while the three"], [245, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 237 men sat as if rooted to their chairs. Richard felt that not only had all hope irrevocably to be abandoned, but that the announcement to his father of the step he was about to take could not be delayed. With regard to the step itself he never wavered for an instant. As for Davenport, notwithstanding his out wardly calm demeanour, he was swayed by conflicting emotions, though he had fully made up his mind that neither of these would make him swerve one inch from the course he had mapped out. Nevertheless, the joy at his coming revenge, which he intended to heighten by personally arresting his enemy, was embittered by one regret\u2014 that of having to inflict suffering on Richard Clynborough, for whom he had conceived a sincere liking. The anguish that would fall to the lot of Lady Mary did not affect him one way or the other. He considered it part of the punishment awarded by Providence to the children for the sins of the parents, and, rightly or wrongly, in this instance he had come to look upon himself as the instrument of Providence here"], [246, "238 The Mystery of the on earth, not only with regard to the innocent victims of Lord Brackelonde's latest crime, but with regard to the criminal himself.

The concession he had made to Lady Mary by affording her the opportunity to leave England before the blow fell was not prompted by any feeling for her or affection for the memory of her dead mother, which, Davenport would have scarcely hesitated to acknowledge, he hated with only one degree less of virulence than the still living destroyer of his happiness. The concession was wholly due to his deep- seated gratitude and more than brotherly love for Mr. Walter Greybridge, one of the two men who had steadfastly refused to believe in his guilt, who would have stood shoulder to shoulder with him even against his (Grey bridge's) sister and parents had James Drayton"], [247, "Patrician Club. 239 chosen to accept the battle, as, luckily for him, Captain Edmundsbury had been prevailed upon to do. Long before the termination of the inter view Daly had become vaguely conscious that he had been cast for an important, albeit apparently minor, part in a drama outside his usual repertory, or, for that matter, outside the repertory of any of his colleagues, and in consequence he had grown serious indeed. He was mentally calculating the probable effects of his failure, and looked anxiously at his chief as they left the threshold of Clovelly House. Davenport's first words instantly dispelled his fears. \" Don't be downhearted, Daly,\" said Davenport, cheerfully. \" You failed where no one would have succeeded, except perhaps your old sergeant, Ephraim Masters, who, I fancy, would have known of the existence of that towing-path below.

If anything happens between now and to morrow afternoon at three, wire to my private address ; after that to the Golden Lion at Stancoombe. On Tuesday morning I will wire further instructions.\" Daly jumped into a cab and Davenport stood staring after him for a while. \" I'll send Daly the two 'jokers,' and tell him what to do with them if anything happens to me,\" he said, almost aloud; \"for he'd kill me as"], [253, "Patrician Club. 245 he killed Dubois if he could get the chance,\" he added, mentally. The station-master at Stancoombe had a second surprise in the advent of what he thought another strange passenger early on the Monday evening. A second glance showed him, however, that the traveller of the previous Friday morning and the one who had just alighted were the self-same. It was, in fact, Jasper Davenport, provided with a warrant for the arrest of Lord Bracke londe. This time, though, Davenport neither inquired for a fly nor availed himself of the omnibus to the Golden Lion, but put his bag and wraps into the cloak-room and walked away towards the town. But only for a short distance. When he had gone about three hundred yards in that direction he turned to the right and crossed the bridge which Daly had crossed in pursuit of Lord Brackelonde. Then he sauntered leisurely along, like a man out for an evening stroll, until he per ceived the spire of St. Olave's in a horizontal"], [254, "The Mystery of the 246 line with him. Picking his way carefully between the alders and poplars that lined the road, he glanced carefully up and down the towing-path some dozen feet below. There was no need to explore it ; not a drop of rain had fallen for the last week, the ground was too hard to have received any impressions. Nevertheless, Davenport's face lighted up as he espied, at a hundred yards or so to his right, the figure of a man sitting with his back against the wall formed by the embank ment of the higher road. Davenport had no means of descent except by jumping, and as he felt no inclination for an effort of the kind he walked on until he came to the sharp bend that sloped to the water's edge. He kept dawdling on, apparently with no other object than to kill time, until he got close to the figure he had discerned from his vantage point above. The man seemed engrossed with his book. By his side lay a macintosh, and atop stood a small basket, probably containing provisions, for the neck of a bottle was sticking out of it. He only gave a"], [255, "Patrician Club. 247 casual glance at Davenport, then resumed his reading. Davenport felt at a loss how to break the conversational ice with Ephraim Masters, for the recumbent individual before him was the former sergeant of dragoons, who had eventually married his cousin's maid, Martha Clarewell. In another moment he had made up his mind to take the position by storm. \" Good evening, Mr. Masters,\" he said. \" Your memory is not as good as mine, for I recognized you immediately, though it is many years ago since we met.\" At the sound of his own name, Masters \u2014 Davenport had not been mistaken \u2014 put down his book deliberately and cast a long and searching look at the speaker. Then he slowly got on his legs, for he shook from head to foot, his eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets, and his voice was husky as he gasped \u2014 \" Lieutenant Drayton ? \" \"That's right,\" said Davenport, holding out his hand, which the other grasped in silence."], [256, "248 The Mystery of the The two men stood facing one another for a while without uttering a word ; then Daven port pointed to the houses opposite, all the gardens of which sloped direct to the river. There was no intervening road. \" Watching ? \" asked Davenport. Masters merely nodded, not showing the least surprise at his interlocutor's evident knowledge of the situation. He could not have explained logically either that or the former lieutenant's unexpected appearance upon the scene ; but he felt as instinctively as the most inveterate lover of melodrama could have felt that the fitness of that appearance could not be questioned, that without that appearance the drama of which he knew the prologue, as enacted a quarter of a century before, would have been as \"Hamlet\" with the part of the Prince of Denmark left out. \" At my cousin's ? \" queried Davenport Masters nodded assent again. \" Sure ? \" said Davenport. \" Cocksure,\" was the answer.

I lay down in the bottom of the punt in mid-stream from six till half past nine, holding my spy-glass over the edge. At nine I saw Miss Drayton come into the garden, apparently unconcerned, but with a pretty good-sized watering pot in her hand, and just as Topham \u2014 you know old Topham's son ? \u2014 was gone. Now, I know of old that she always comes out for half-an hour while he is there.

If he attempts it, I am powerless to prevent it. The towing-path is pretty nigh two miles long, and there are several little skiffs be longing to the houses on either side of him. Even if I heard the splashing of sculls I might be mistaken in that direction. Up till now I know he did not get away from the front, for he must cross the garden to do that, and my book is merely a pretext. I have not had my eyes off the garden for nearly twenty hours. I feel certain, though, that he will come across here ; but when once it gets dark I'm undone. I am not sorry you have come, for I'm no good single-handed.\" Davenport's face contracted and his left hand went up to his eyebrow, at which he began tugging violently. The dilemma"], [260, "The Mystery of the 252 which Masters had exposed and was bewail ing seemed serious enough to baffle even his (Davenport's) experience. Short of a power ful search-light and at least a dozen men postedalongthe two milesoftowing-path, there was nothing to prevent the escape of Lord Brackelonde after dark, whether he had or had not the suit of clothes suggested by Masters, and, of course, a search-light was out of the question for many reasons, even if he had been able to procure one. No matter how the arrest was effected, the circumstantial evidence of it would transpire in court, and, if effected now, his cousin's name would be mixed up with it. That was to be prevented at all costs ; but for that the matter could have been simplified at once. A skiff would have landed him in five minutes at the gate of his cousin's garden across the stream, either by himself or with sufficient aid to execute his warrant, and five minutes more would have seen his enemy hand-bound in his power.

He felt no bitterness against her. \" God will forgive me,\" said Heine a few days before his death to the priest who exhorted him to repent of his sins. \" God will forgive me, for it is His business to forgive.\" Davenport remembered the words, and he knew that woman in her capacity for forgiving nearly approaches the divine ideal. Nay, at that moment, but for a moment only, he felt angry with himself for not being able to \" go and do likewise.\" The next, the whole of his human nature revolted at the idea of his foregoing his revenge. \" If,\" as he had said to Mr. Greybridge, \" his salvation depended upon it, he would not have one ounce less than his pound of flesh, and that with the blood in it.\" He took out his watch. It pointed to the quarter to eight. \" Where is your punt ? \" he asked. \" At Abrahams's, a mile up stream,\" was the answer. \" Go and get it. I will wait here. Leave"], [262, "The Mystery of the 254 me your telescope. Remember, I cannot swim, and if he stirs I have no means of going after him.\" Three-quarters of an hour later the punt lay alongside the spot whence Davenport had not stirred, and Masters was receiving his last instructions. \" There is still about a quarter or half an hour's daylight,\" said Daven port. \" Get your punt into midstream and moor it there to your ryspeck. Make as little splash as possible. I am afraid you are in for a night of it ; but there is a large reward, though I know you are not working for that. Of course you don't stir unless he does. He may try to get away even if he has no skiff. I don't know how, but he may. In that case you go after him on foot or in the punt. He is not a bit younger than you, and you ought to be able to keep up with him. If he does get away and you can keep him in sight, wire from wherever you are to me at the Ship Hotel, Dover.

Can you re member all I told you ? \" \" Every word ; depend on me. \" Will you have some money in case of need ? \" \" I have got about \u00a35 on me ; I'll not want more.\" \" Good-bye,\" and there was a silent grip of Masters' outstretched hand. Davenport walked quickly along the tow ing-path, which finished a little past the bridge, where there was another slope cor responding to the one at the top and leading into the high-road. Half-way across the bridge he stopped for a moment lost in thought, reviewing the events of the last few days. He stood with his back against the iron railing, when a swinging step rang on the white, hard macadam. He looked up. A man was hurrying by, carrying a good sized parcel wrapped in brown paper and a small black bag. The face was known to him, and yet for the moment he could not recall it to mind. Then he suddenly remem-"], [264, "256 The Mystery of the Patrician Club. bered ; it was Horner, the head waiter at the Golden Lion and the former valet of Lord Brackelonde. And simultaneously with the remembrance came a flash of inspiration ; the parcel and bag contained clothes and neces saries for the man he was tracking, and they were being conveyed to a certain spot agreed upon beforehand. Without an instant's hesitation Davenport started in pursuit of the vanishing figure, whose outline, though, was still plainly discernible in the fast-waning daylight. Onward went Horner along the high-road Davenport had travelled an hour or so before him, onward past the incline that led to the towing-path, onward for a mile and a half to the right, until he came to a small wayside inn called the Perch, which he entered, utterly unconscious of his having been followed at a hundred yards' distance, Davenport's light footfall having failed to reach his ears. Davenport stood irresolute for a moment, then slowly turned in the direction whence he had come."], [265, "CHAPTER XII. Davenport turned slowly in the direction whence he had come, for his first impulse had been to enter the Perch at Homers heels, to await the arrival of Lord Bracke- londe and to carry out his warrant there and then. A few moments of reflection showed him the risks of such a step, for many reasons. That Horner was acting upon instructions from his (Davenport's) cousin there was not the least doubt in Davenport's mind, and the fact of his thus acting showed that he was more or less interested in abetting Lord Brackelonde's escape, and more or less aware of the cause that necessitated it. Horner might not know that cause to be murder, but surely suspected it to be suffi ciently grave, seeing the expedients resorted to. Under such circumstances the appear- vol. ii. s"], [266, "The Mystery of the 258 ance of any stranger at the Perch obviously not belonging to its usual clientele would be calculated to arouse Horner's alarm. Daven port's appearance would do more than that. Horner was by no means devoid of intelli gence ; Davenport had been able to judge of that during their conversation on the previous Friday, and would not fail to remember that conversation, which had almost entirely borne upon Lord Brackelonde himself. He would inevitably make his way back to Stancoombe to warn Miss Drayton that her plans had been discovered, and in that case there would be an end to the chance of apprehending his man in that spot. Not that Davenport was particularly anxious to effect the arrest there, or, for that matter, anywhere near Stancoombe. The idea of it was only one degree less repugnant to him than that of arresting Lord Brackelonde under his cousin's roof, and pretty well for the same reason. Her name was to be kept out of the evidence at all costs, and Horner was as likely to divulge it under the fire of cross-examination"], [267, "Patrician Club. 259 as not. Moreover, Davenport was not blind to the bodily risk of bearding his enemy un aided and in a place where the moral support of the witnesses of the arrest might fail him \u2014 nay, be enlisted on the wrong side. Davenport was no coward, but he knew that in a hand-to-hand struggle with Lord Bracke londe the advantage would be with the latter to a fatal extent, and though perhaps prepared to sacrifice his life for the realiza tion of his long-cherished dream of revenge, he shrank from jeopardizing it merely in order to afford the other a better chance of escape. In addition to this, Davenport argued that in allowing Lord Brackelonde a few more hours of freedom, he might be enabled to provide Captain Edmundsbury with indubitable proofs of his accuser's inten tion to leave the country and to shirk the inquiry of the Committee of the Patrician Club into the card scandal ; for Davenport felt certain that Lord Brackelonde would endeavour to make for the coast, preferably for Dover. He might flatter himself that if s 2"], [268, "The Mystery of the 260 he could reach Calais unmolested there would be at least two countries open to him where his limited knowledge of French might stand him in good stead. Finally, Daven port was not averse to letting his enemy delude himself with the hope that he had once for all succeeded in baffling him. It would make his revenge all the sweeter when it came. And all these motives combined induced him to turn away from the roadside inn instead of entering it. He wished, however, to put Masters on his guard by telling him that the escape was planned for that night ; but by the time he reached the spot opposite to which the punt lay moored it was quite dark, and he had no lantern wherewith to give the preconcerted signal that would bring Masters to his side. To attract Masters' attention by shouting to him was out of the question. In the stillness of the night and borne upon the river his voice would reach the summer-house, where he had no doubt Lord Brackelonde was on the watch."], [269, "Patrician Club. 261 For the first time for many days \u2014 nay, for many years \u2014 Davenport found his ingenuity at fault ; Masters might have been in an inaccessible fortress or on a sea-girt rock as far as he (Davenport) was concerned. There were only two means of communicating with him \u2014 to get a punt or a lantern of Abrahams, the boat-builder ; and a request for either or both would arouse suspicion. The principle of \" kicking up no dust \" was too precious to be disregarded by any one, and accord ing to him, he had already too many auxili aries. All the great coups in his career had been accomplished single-handed, and he really saw no reason why this, the greatest of all, should prove the exception. His success had invariably been due to his capacity for \"putting himself into the skin\" of the criminal he was tracking, and he felt no doubt that in this instance also he had instinctively guessed the tactics of the man he wanted to capture. Logically, there was little or no reason why Lord Brackelonde should not make for London, Southampton,"], [270, "The Mystery of the 262 Liverpool, or any other seaport; nay, if he had been in Lord Brackelonde's place, he would have made for no seaport at all, but have endeavoured to get \" lost in London.\" And yet Davenport felt confident that Dover was his intended goal, and that not solely for the reasons already stated. Nor was it because he underrated Lord Brackelonde's clever ness. On Davenport's part it was simply a question of instinct. Under these circum stances, and though he had instructed Masters to dog the fugitive's footsteps if possible, he by no means depended upon the erstwhile sergeant's action as a factor in the final upshot. His (Davenport's) instinct had already partially proved true \u2014 the wayside inn was decidedly on the road to Dover, and to nowhere else ; he would, therefore, trust still further to that instinct, and for the moment turn his atten tion to a question which lay heavily both on his heart and mind, viz. the secession of his cousin. That secession was not solely due to the womanly capacity for forgiveness, however near that capacity might approach"], [271, "Patrician Club. 263 the divine, but to some mystery which he dreaded to fathom, lest it should absolutely bar the road to his vengeance. The misery he was inflicting on one innocent victim \u2014 he was thinking of Richard Clynborough \u2014 was already too much for his generous nature, and he had known Richard scarcely a week ; what if he had to inflict a deeper misery on one whom he loved as a sister and mother in one ? He was not ignorant of the almost idolatrous passion Caroline Drayton had cherished for Frederick Stalforth and of the latter's cowardly desertion of her. But what if there were something more terrible behind which, after changing all-mastering love into hate, had finally converted hate into pity ? He would know the worst at once. One glance was sufficient to show Daven port the havoc which the events of the last few days had wrought with Caroline Drayton's features and general appearance. As she rose to greet him she looked a spectre of her former self, and the magnifi-"], [272, "264 The Mystery of the cent dark eyes which had met his so frankly and affectionately on the occasion of his late visit looked dim ; but they did not flinch from his gaze. The tension was too much for both, and yet each dreaded to speak first. Miss Drayton did not for one instant doubt her cousin's absolute knowledge of her having afforded shelter to his bitterest enemy, and Davenport had no intention of denying that knowledge ; so any verbal skirmishing on that point was superfluous. Davenport's chief aim was to ascertain the motive or motives that had converted her from an ally into an opponent \u2014 for, charitable as he felt towards her, he could not but regard her as such, \u2014 and to determine whether these motives were sufficiently powerful to stay his hand also, if possible, lest he should bring disgrace and life-long remorse upon his nearest and dearest. Like Lady Mary, he knew Brackelonde too well not to foresee that, if once within the meshes of the law, nothing would prevent him from bespatter ing the reputation of any and every one from"], [273, "Patrician Club. 265 sheer fiendish hatred, and his cousin's fair name was more precious to him than his own. On her part, Miss Drayton was determined not to reveal those motives. The only being on earth, as she thought, who might have guessed them had been laid to rest nearly two years. She had successfully kept the secret of her life twenty-five years ago, when, rather than reveal it, she allowed her cousin to be spurned by the woman he loved and go forth into the world a social pariah, branded as a cheat, while the man she looked upon as her husband married that woman. She would keep it now, lest the revelation of it should shake that cousin's fell purpose of revenge. She was not anxious that the dastard who had ruined her honour and wrecked her life should go scot-free. She had nothing to fear from him ; she was certain that he was in utter ignorance of the most terrible consequences of his crime against her. Her conviction to that effect had been acquired but very recently, and at the cost of a half-hour's agony, compared"], [274, "The Mystery of the 266 with which the agony of the last twenty-four years was as nothing ; an agony which had left traces in the sunken cheeks and dimmed eyes ; an agony which, in spite of herself, had, as it were, been the last and sudden flicker of that brightly burning flame of love of former days, previous to its total extinction. The misgivings which, notwithstanding the assurances to the contrary given to her cousin on the Friday, had beset her after his departure, were gone. Two glimpses of the fiend in human shape upon whom she had looked once as a demi-god had made her a free woman. She would have delivered him hand bound there and then, as Delilah delivered Samson, had his pursuer been nigh or had there been a means of summoning him without causing a sensation. She did not drive Bracke londe forth again lest she should afford him a second chance of escape ; but she sat count ing the minutes till Davenport's arrival \u2014 nay, would have hastened that arrival but for her ignorance of his private address, and her fear of arousing curiosity in Stancoombe by wiring"], [275, "Patrician Club. 267 to Scotland Yard, especially on Sunday. Besides, what would have been the use ? She knew as well as if she had been told that the pursuer whom Lord Brackelonde had managed to elude was one of her cousin's emissaries, whose report would leave him (Davenport) no doubt of his enemy's hiding place. So she waited, though impatiently, meanwhile laying her plans to prevent the only thing she dreaded now \u2014 the arrest of Lord Brackelonde under her roof. In order to prevent this, the clothes and other things which Horner had carried to the Perch were bought, though no inkling had been given him for whom they were intended ; nor had Lord Brackelonde himself been told as yet the hour at which he was to make his second attempt. She would wait to tell him until Davenport had come. There was not the faintest hesitation in her mind or heart about betraying the man who had trusted her in his hour of supreme need. She had trusted him, and he had betrayed her. It was simply the lex talionis, and, rightly"], [276, "The Mystery of the 268 or wrongly, the Draytons acknowledge no other. That was why Davenport had failed to grasp the situation as foreshadowed by Daly's account on the Sunday afternoon and de veloped by Masters but a few hours ago. He was under the impression that when Fate had virtually given the game into her hands she would throw up the cards \u2014 nay, that she had thrown them up already, and that the look she gave him on entering was one of defiance. Her answer to his first question undeceived him at once. \" He is still here ? \" he asked abruptly. \" Yes ; and will remain until you tell me to bid him go.\" For one moment he stood quite still. Then the light of satisfied revenge flashed from his eyes ; he flung his arms around her neck and kissed her on both cheeks. \" Why was Horner sent to the Perch with clothes ? \" he said, after a little while, his suspicions not being laid yet."], [277, "Patrician Club. 269 \" How do you know that ? \" was the counter question. \" I reached here three hours ago. I saw him cross the bridge, and followed him.' \" Sit down here by me and I will tell you, James. You need not hurry ; he will not stir until I give the signal, and whatever we have forgotten or tried to forget \u2014 he and I, I mean,\" she added, bitterly, \" we are not likely to make a mistake in that.\" Then she suddenly checked herself, as if she had said too much. Davenport looked into her face to read the rest, but it had become placid again, and she went on \u2014 \" People are long-lived in this part of the world, James, and twenty-four years are to them as many months. They have not for gotten that Miss Drayton was once spoken of as the future Lady Brackelonde. They no doubt wondered why their forecasts failed. We must not give them an opportunity to renew their speculations ; consequently Lord"], [278, "The Mystery of the 270 Brackelonde must not only not be arrested under her roof, but the world must remain in ignorance that he sought shelter there.\" Davenport nodded approval. \" I have thought of that, Caroline,\" he said. \" Go on.\" \" There is not much to add,\" she remarked. \" I need not weary you at length with an account of how he walked through the open window into this room on Saturday night, or rather early on Sunday morning. I was sit ting in that chair reading. No ; he didn't frighten me, in spite of the abject terror in his face and his miserable condition. He is cur enough to think that all my hatred is gone and all my former love for him has returned. Ah me ! if he but knew how his very presence here sickens me ! Deliver me from it as soon as you can, for another four-and twenty hours of it will kill me.\" \"When is he to go?\" \" When you are ready. I made my plans yesterday morning, and communicated them"], [279, "Patrician Club. 271 on a piece of paper when I brought him his food.\" \" I know that, too,\" said Davenport. Then, seeing her look of surprise, he added : \" Masters has been watching since six on Sunday.\" \" Why should Masters concern himself with this ? \" she gasped, turning very pale. Davenport eyed her very narrowly. \" Masters espoused our cause when he married your maid,\" he remarked pointedly. \" Besides, he has a grudge against him on his own account.\" \" That's true,\" she murmured with a sigh of relief. The sigh did not pass unperceived ; but Davenport's suspicions with regard to the existence of a secret on his cousin's part needed no confirmation. As he had no wish to fathom the secret, he brought back the conversation to its starting-point. \" When is he to go ? \" \" When you are ready for him.\""], [280, "The Mystery of the 272 Then he told her his plans in combination with Masters. \" You may take Masters away,\" said Miss Drayton. \" Send him to the Perch with in structions to follow him ; but there is no necessity even for that.\" She was evidently reluctant to let Masters come in contact with Lord Brackelonde. Davenport felt this instinctively. Neverthe less he objected. \" What if he should get away altogether ? \" he asked. Miss Drayton shook her head. \" He will not get away if you do exactly what I tell you.\" Then with a smile which even as tonished her cousin by its ferocity, she said, \" I may take it that you are bent upon arresting him yourself? \" The smile that played upon Davenport's lips was just as ferocious ; but it did not sur prise Miss Drayton ; she knew him better than he knew her. \" I would like to have a final interview with him, if ever so short, before he departs this"], [281, "Patrician Club. 273 life ; and my arresting him will be the only chance of it. In England, when the hyena in human form is caged, he must not be worried by the human jackal. Yes, I would like to see him once more in this life, as we are not likely to meet in the other \u2014 if there be one.\" \" In that case you may dismiss Masters or not, just as you like. You alone will be sufficient for the thing. When he has changed his clothes at the Perch he will make straight for Dover by road or rail \u2014 more likely by road. He made for Dover on Saturday night, and he will make for it again, for he knows that there lies his best and per haps only chance of escape.\" \" Strange,\" mused Davenport, \" that I should have had a conviction to the same effect. Is it instinct, I wonder ? \" he said, addressing his cousin directly. \" Not in my case, whatever it may be in yours. I go upon facts,\" and seeing that he was at a loss to understand, she went on, \u2014 \" There are perhaps two men in the whole VOL. II.

The one is Wakeford, his head coachman, in whom, to use the popular phrase, ' blood is thicker than water ; ' the other is Wardlaw, who seems altogether devoted to him, for reasons which, people say, will not bear investiga tion.\" \" I don't know Wardlaw ; I never heard the name before,\" said Davenport, his curiosity fully aroused. \" Of course you haven't. Wardlaw came into his existence after you were gone. He was his yacht master for many years. When he gave up his yacht after his second marriage the purchaser had no need for Wardlaw's services, and Brackelonde's influence got him the command of a Channel steamer. Ward law is the captain of the Seamew ; I believe it is one of the smaller and night boats \u2014 you can easily ascertain that.

He is honest, but his pent-up hatred may explode and spoil matters.\" \" I want a lantern.\" \"I'll get one.\" Ten minutes later, Davenport, carrying an unlighted lantern, trudged through the solitary streets of Stancoombe on his way to the spot opposite to which Masters lay on the watch. T 2"], [284, "CHAPTER XIII. Davenport was not altogether deceived by his cousin's alleged objection to the part allotted to Masters, first by circumstances, then by Davenport himself. He felt that the \"pent-up hatred,\" the explosion of which Miss Drayton seemed to dread so much, had its origin in some heinous offence of Lord Brackelonde against her and not against his former tenant. Lord Brackelonde's desertion of Miss Drayton in years gone by was assuredly the least reprehensible part of that offence. Of the major crime Lord Bracke londe himself had been allowed to remain in ignorance. Masters had become a sharer in the secret through his marriage with Martha Clarewell, and though it was more than pro bable that from motives of delicacy he had never hinted at his knowledge, Miss Drayton"], [285, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 277 was aware of it, and at this critical juncture trembled at the bare idea of a possible revela tion. Hence it became him (Davenport), as her loving relative, to go no further into this, and to guard her against untoward indiscretion on the pirt of others, however laudable the motives. This was the more incumbent especially from Davenport's point of view, seeing that, on the one hand, no degree of reticence could frustrate his pro jects, while, on the other, an outburst of Masters, or even his mere pursuit of Lord Brackelonde, might alter the latter's intended course of action. If he managed to make his way unmolested and unwatched to Wardlaw's house or ship, he might delude himself with the hope thar. the worst of his danger was over, for his very cleverness and cunning \u2014 which Davenport was far from underrating \u2014 would inevitably lead him into one of two mistakes, perhaps into both. Davenport's faculty of getting into other people's \" mental skin,\" as he called it, which had served him so well during"], [286, "278 The Mystery of the his long detective career, stood him equally in good stead this time. He felt certain that, in spite of Lord Brackelonde's vindictive nature, he attributed Caroline Drayton's acquiescence in sheltering him to a pity which, if no longer akin to love, showed a spirit of relenting on her part which would show itself still further by her remaining neutral in this supreme struggle between him and her cousin. Lord Brackelonde's estimate of the mental capacities of women was, moreover, too low to make him suspect for one moment that Caroline Drayton would remember Wardlaw or anything connected with him. If she did remember, she would still fail to admit the connection as a possible factor in his escape, provided again that she had not been con verted into a neutral spectatrix. In the course of his lengthy and varied experience Davenport had lost faith in the wisdom of many well-established proverbs. There was one, however, in the truth of which his belief remained unshaken, namely, that \" He whom"], [287, "Patrician Club. 279 the gods wish to destroy they first deprive of his reason.\" No matter how clever, astute, educated, and experienced the criminal, he was sure to commit one blunder, and as a rule the blunder was irretrievable in direct proportion to the blunderers mental supe riority. In this instance Davenport felt thoroughly convinced that Lord Brackelonde would go straight to Dover, because it was the most obvious thing to do. He would argue that this most obvious thing would be rejected by Davenport as being too obvious. If, however, he caught sight of Masters he would change his mind ; hence Masters must be despatched straight to Dover, on some mere useless errand, in order not to wound his susceptibilities. He must be told that Lord Brackelonde had perceived the punt, and that its remaining moored in midstream would delay his attempt to swim across. Two hours later Caroline Drayton gave the long-expected signal by tapping at the window of the summer-house, and five"], [288, "The Mystery of the 280 minutes afterwards she and Davenport heard from the garden steps the splash, though more or less deadened, of a heavy body diving into the water. Captain Wardlaw occupied a small tene ment in the Priory Road, differing in no way from the half-score of tenements on each side of it. Being a widower and away from home most of his time, he kept but a small estab lishment. One servant sufficed for all his wants, and even she seemed to find the hours hang heavily on her hands during his absence, and evidently tried to beguile their flight by an assiduous survey of the some what quiet thoroughfare from the front parlour, at the windows of which she was generally seated pretending to do needlework. This latter piece of information was volun teered to Davenport himself about an hour after his arrival at Dover on the Tuesday morning by the landlady of the Priory Inn, which was situated opposite the row of small"], [289, "Patrician Club. 281 houses. Having ascertained that the Seameio \u2014 for the name had been correctly given by Miss Drayton \u2014 had crossed to Calais on the previous evening, and would not return until about three on the Wednesday morning, she being engaged exclusively on night service for the next few weeks, Davenport, like the good general he was, had made it his business to survey personally the possible scene of either the principal engagement or an out post affair. Daly was on the Admiralty Pier watching the steamers that would convey the passengers of the eight o'clock train from London across the Channel, for though Davenport felt pretty certain that Lord Brackelonde would by preference trust him self and his fortunes to his former yacht master, he (Davenport) was determined not to be caught napping. Besides, it was but a quarter to nine, and he had ample time to return to the pier before the steamers started. He had left Stancoombe shortly after five that morning, driving his cousin's dogeart himself, and keeping a sharp look-out, with-"], [290, "The Mystery of the 282 out, however, fostering the slightest hope of being rewarded for his vigilance. He had, in fact, no wish to confront Lord Brackelonde on a lonely road, for he felt that under such circumstances his own life would not be worth a minute's purchase. Two murders would not weigh heavier on his enemy's conscience than one, and the second crime might shield him from the penalty of the first, and could not increase that penalty. And yet, when Davenport came to the spot where by a loop the road branched off to Canterbury he checked his horse for a moment, during which he sat debating whether his instinct was after all so infallible as he deemed it to be, and whether his quarry might not have taken that direction. For one moment he sat thus ; the next a slight touch of the whip set the animal in motion again on the Dover road. Strong in his conviction that he was the instrument of God's justice on earth, he looked upon the promptings of his instinct as the gift of prophecy vouchsafed to him for the nonce. Even if his enemy had swerved"], [291, "Patrician Club. 283 from the route mapped out for him by Fate, he would finally gravitate towards Dover. Davenport felt sure of it, and had no further misgivings on that head. It was shortly after one when Miss Dray ton had given Lord Brackelonde the signal that the coast was clear. The nearest spot where he could have landed was a little more than a mile and a half from the Perch, and from the latter place to the Priory Road was, at a rough guess, twenty miles by the road. Making allowance for Lord Brackelonde's prowess as a pedestrian, Davenport calculated that he could not have walked the distance in less than four hours and a half, so that it must have been between six and seven before he entered the town, probably by the Priory Road. His first business would be, as a matter of course, to ascertain whether Wardlaw was at home or on duty, provided he had made up his mind to claim shelter under the latter's roof ; for he could not risk the door being closed in his face by a sus picious servant-maid in the absence of her"], [292, "The Mystery of the 284 master. Nevertheless he might have gone straight to Wardlaw without a preliminary inquiry, and that was what Davenport wished to ascertain if possible. It would be futile to sound the landlady of the Priory Inn on that point, so, after eliciting from her a few un important particulars with regard to the back-issues of the houses in Priory Terrace, which particulars convinced him that no escape would be attempted that way, he took his leave with the words, \" I have an idea that this is the Captain Wardlaw I knew abroad.\" The words would account to a certain extent for his gossip with her, and afford a pretext for his next step, which was to ring the bell at Wardlaw's itself. He listened attentively after he had done so, but almost before the sound had ceased the door was opened by the maid. She could not have had time to consult anyone. \" Is Captain Wardlaw at home ?\" asked Davenport. \" No, sir ; he will not be home before four to-morrow morning,\" was the answer."], [293, "Patrician Club. 285 \" That's awkward,\" observed Davenport, as if talking to himself, but loud enough for the maid to hear it, and looking at his boots, as if considering what to do next. Then he raised his eyes to those of the girl. \" I sent a message to him about seven this morning, but I have not seen my friend since. I suppose Captain Wardlaw was at home this morning ? \" \" No, sir; he went on duty at eight last night, and there's been no message left for him. No one called.\" \" Thank you. My friend probably heard that he was on duty. I'll see Captain Ward law when he comes home.\" \" Shall I tell him who called, sir ? \" \"No, thank you ; it is a long while since I have seen him, and he may not remember the name.\" With which he walked away. Not for any great distance \u2014 only about fifty yards up the road, whence he could keep the house in view. He wanted \" to think.\" That was evident by the way he pushed his soft felt hat to the back of his head and"], [294, "286 The Mystery of the began tugging at his eyebrows ; with the result that in a moment or so he retreated a little further still, though not losing sight of Wardlaw's residence, took out a pocket-book \u2014 a somewhat larger one than he carried in his waistcoat \u2014 and began to scribble in it. His effort in that direction was not protracted, for he soon tore out the leaf he had covered, produced a small envelope, enclosed the leaf with a card, and \u2014 waited. Waited for nearly a quarter of an hour, peering up and down the thoroughfare. At last his patience was rewarded, for his face brightened as a cab came trundling down the road. In another minute he had given the driver his instruc tions. \" You know Superintendent Castle ? \" he asked. \" Yes, sir ; everybody knows him.\" \" Take this to him or to the inspector in charge, and wait for the answer. Mind, tell the inspector to open it ; and be as quick as you can.\" Off drove the man, and Davenport was once"], [295, "Patrician Club. 287 more alone. The appeal for aid was his last resource. He felt that he and Daly could no longer cope with the situation by themselves. He took out his watch ; it was a quarter after nine. His usual sangfroid began to forsake him, for he could not help specu lating upon what would happen if Lord Brackelonde had succeeded in hiding him self somewhere in the town and made his way at the last moment on to the mail-boat in his (Davenport's) absence. Daly would assuredly follow him, but Daly had no warrant ; furthermore, there would be no time for Daly to communicate with him. It was with a sigh of relies that he beheld the cab turn the corner and the familiar face of Superintendent Castle leaning out of the window. Both the greeting and the conversation were brief. Could Castle lend him three or four intelligent men, not necessarily eagles, but fairly intelligent constables. Davenport could not exactly tell him the main purport of his mission, but the men would be well rewarded"], [296, "The Mystery of the 288 before he went. They were wanted for thirty six hours at the utmost, during which time they would have to watch in couples, the other two to remain within easy reach of their comrades, so as to be able to report to him (Davenport) and to receive fresh instruc tions. It was Wardlaw's house that had to be watched, and Wardlaw himself also when he came off duty, which would not be until three or four next morning. Noticing the superintendent's surprise, Davenport ex plained that, up till then, the sailor had had nothing to do with the case, but that he might be drawn into it. Meanwhile the servant, if she went upon an apparently un usual errand, was not to be lost sight of. For the rest, any and every one, especially telegraph messengers or seemingly private ones, were to be reported. Superintendent Castle made no difficulties. Apart from the fact that Davenport's fame had spread to the provinces, the superinten dent had been his auxiliary two years before in a case which had brought the superinten-"], [297, "Patrician Club. 289 dent two nice crisp .\u00a310 notes and pro motion besides. \" Plain clothes ? \" he merely asked. \" I think so,\" was the answer. \" But where is your reserve to be posted ? \" \" Leave that to me. I think I can man- >! age. \" Very well, then : give me a note for your inspector to send the men to you, for I must go, and you must not stir until they come. Oh ! by-the-by, they need not stint them selves in anything. Here are five pounds to go on with.\" Saying which he held out his pocket-book for Castle to sign an order for four men, whom the superintendent desig nated by name. Considerably relieved, he jumped into the cab that had been waiting, and, taking the headquarters on his way, reached the Admiralty Pier just as the London trains were discharging their pas- sengers. \" Anything fresh ? \" he asked of Daly \" Nothing ; there is no sign of him,\" was the answer. u VOL. 11."], [298, "The Mystery of the 290 Twenty minutes later the gangways were drawn ashore, and as Davenport stood dreamily watching the foam-crested waves in the trail of the fast-vanishing vessels he felt that the hour of his supreme joy was once more postponed. The day dragged its weary length along, for the intense agony of suspense was begin ning to tell even upon Davenport, as the hours went by without sign of a move on his enemy's part. For the twentieth time, per haps, since the previous night Davenport fell a-doubting the promptings of his instinct, and still his instinct told him that his doubts were but the offspring of his impatience. The midday and club boats had come alongside the pier and departed, the night mails had been despatched ; it was eleven o'clock, and he and Daly, tired and foot-sore though they were, kept trudging up and down the long stretch of flagstone of the lower Admiralty Pier. With the exception of the departure of the boats, no incident had occurred to"], [299, "Patrician Club. 291 break the monotony of their single or joint watch. The batch of plain-clothes constables posted in the Priory Road had sent no com- munication ; Superintendent Castle had not been near them ; and, more odd to relate, Ephraim Masters had failed to report himself, as had been agreed between him and Daven- port. The latter could not help thinking that his prolonged absence betokened something, and, what was worse, something that might seriously delay matters by having given Lord Brackelonde an indication of the trap set for him. Davenport's instructions to the erst- while sergeant of dragoons had aimed at keeping him out of the way rather than utiliz- ing his services. He had been told to ex- plore the more humble quarters of the town, to visit the haunts and resorts of the sailors and fishermen, on the chance of Lord Bracke- londe taking refuge there between the hour of his arrival and that of his attempted depar ture. Davenport knew full well that Lord Brackelonde would repair to none of these, but would boldly proceed to the Lord Warden or u 2"], [300, "The Mystery of the 292 some equally well-known hotel, order a private sitting-room, and abide his favourable oppor tunity ; but to allot him so seemingly impor tant a part in the pursuit would, Davenport argued, be gratifying to Masters and prevent him from occasioning mischief elsewhere. But what if Lord Brackelonde had in reality adopted the plan with which Davenport had fictitiously credited him ? What if he had chosen an obscure tavern for his temporary hiding place, instead of a fashionable hostelry ? What if, startled by his sudden meeting with Masters, he had taken flight, with Masters giving chase, but unable to communicate with him (Davenport) lest the other should escape ? All these possibilities were presenting themselves to him at that moment, when, worn out bodily and mentally, he had dropped on to an empty porter's truck, leaving Daly to continue his perambulation. The hat was pushed off the brow once more, his hand was raised to his eyebrow, when a boyish voice at his back made him stop."], [301, "Patrician Club. 293 \" Mr. Jasper Davenport ? \" said the voice. \"Yes,\" replied Davenport, turning round. \" A telegram that's just come, sir.\" It was \" buttons \" from the Ship Hotel. \" Thank you, my lad ; and here's a shilling for you. Tell the night porter to look out for more and send them immediately. I can't leave here.\" Meanwhile he had torn open the envelope and drawn under a gas-lamp to read the message, looking first of all at the signature. It was Masters. The message had been handed in at Canterbury half an hour pre viously, and ran as follows : \u2014 \" He is here, and can't stir without my knowledge. Writing by to-night's post. Don't stir from pier ; he may leave at any moment. \u2014 Masters.\" Davenport drew a deep sigh as he suddenly recollected how he had checked his horse at the cross roads in the morning. Then he joined Daly and gave him the slip of pink paper. \" Go and get two or three hours'"], [302, "The Mystery of the 294 sleep, but first find Superintendent Castle for me, and ask him to come back with you at two. No, Daly, I don't want rest as much as you do ; besides, if I tried I shouldn't get it. Go now and be back at two, not later ; for when Captain Wardlaw comes off the boat he must not be left for one minute.\" With this he resumed his seat on the porter's truck and sat listening to Daly's retreating footsteps. When their sound had ceased he fell into a deep reverie. He had spoken the truth when he said that no rest would come to him even if he should seek it ; but no misgiving as to the ultimate result of his pursuit would have kept him awake. The very fact of Masters proving an unexpected aid when he had looked upon him as almost a hindrance tended to strengthen his inmost conviction that Fate was fighting on his side. Nay, he felt that without his lifting a finger his enemy would be given into his hands, and he could not forbear smiling at the prospect of the praise that would be lavished on him when the super-"], [303, "Patrician Club. 295 ficial \u2014 as distinct from the real \u2014 story of the capture came to be published. The public and the press would hail him as a worthy disciple of Vidocq and Canler, while in reality he had, from private and professionally repre hensible motives, been playing with his victim as a cat plays with a mouse, without the cat's certainty of being the victor in the end. For, instinct or no instinct, he ought to have arrested Lord Brackelonde in his cousin's summer-house. Nor was his restlessness due to any intense desire to be informed of Masters' adventures. The promised letter would tell him all that in good time ; meanwhile he sat musing on the past and trying to pierce the future. What would become of him when his vengeance was accomplished ? Would he relinquish his occupation and resume his former place in society ? And would that resumption compensate him for the bitter sufferings of nearly a quarter of a century ? \" No, no,\" came the emphatic answer from within ; and Davenport felt that when his task should be at"], [304, "296 The Mystery of the an end he himself would be so weary as to lie down willingly and hail death as the weary traveller hails sleep. A hand laid gently on his shoulder awoke him from his reverie ; Superintendent Castle stood by his side, and Daly invitingly held out a pocket flask. He had sat there for three mortal hours undisturbed by the outer world. He slightly shivered as he rose from his sitting posture and wrapt his ulster tighter around him. There was a faint streak of pinkish grey in the eastern sky, and almost at the same moment the carriages that were to convey the passengers to London came rumbling on to the quay. \" I hope you enjoyed your sleep, Daly,\" he said, with a wan smile. \" I must have dozed, too, for I did not know it was so late.

He had barely eaten anything for thirty-six hours, notwithstanding the copious meals brought to him from the hotel in a luncheon basket ; he had had no rest nor taken his clothes off during that period, and his ablutions had been summarily performed in a tin washhand basin with a piece of \"mottled\" soap lent to him by one of the men, the napkin provided with his breakfast doing duty as a towel. His spirits were positively at the lowest ebb, and Masters'"], [307, "The Mystery of the Patrician Club. 299 letter was not calculated to raise them.

He was going to Canter bury with his hooded cart in the morning to take some furniture home, and instead of trudging I thought I'd take the train from there to Dover.

If he moves, I will telegraph to you. Your obedient servant, Ephraim Masters.\" After this letter, which came by the first post, Davenport began to think that Lord Brackelonde meant to play a waiting game. On his part, he made up his mind that there should be no third day of that suspense which was fast undermining his strength. Lord Brackelonde's arrest at Canterbury was a different thing from his arrest either at Stancoombe itself, with the co-operation of Masters, or under Miss Drayton's roof. But for the absence of Daly, who had given no sign since he went in the track of Captain Wardlaw, Davenport would have started there and then ; as it was, he decided to be"], [309, "Patrician Club. 301 master of the situation before sunrise next morning. He had ascertained that the Sea mew was to cross that night. He still felt confident that she would be selected then or afterwards by Lord Brackelonde to cross in, but in the event of his delaying his attempt he (Davenport) would proceed to the Fleur de-Lis. It was only nine o'clock. The sea lay calm and resplendent under the summer sun ; and cheered by his resolution Davenport stood for a while watching with a kind of interest the loading of the two steamers lying along side and timed to start in an hour. Most of the cases swung on to the decks had a kind of dainty look, and notwithstanding their bulk were light enough comparatively. Then his thoughts suddenly went off at a tangent ; he remembered the wonderful escapes of which he had read, from that of Grotius in a case supposed to contain books to that of Louis Napoleon disguised as a stonemason. It would not be very difficult to get across the Channel \u2014 nay, as far as Paris in one of"], [310, "The Mystery of the 302 these cases \u2014 provided one had a trusty con federate on board to see it to its place among the cargo. \" Yes,\" he nodded to himself, \" the whole of the success would depend upon the confederate.\" At the same moment the voice that had, as it were, checked the train of thought on the previous night was heard again by his side. \"Mr. Jasper Davenport, a telegram for you, sir,\" said buttons, and disappeared. In the twinkling of an eye the slip of paper was extracted from the envelope. It ran as follows : \u2014 \" He had letter with Canterbury postmark at quarter to eight ; booked at Priory Road for Canterbury quarter past eight. Just arrived here. Gone to Fleur de-Lis. \u2014 Daly.\" The message had been handed in twenty minutes before. Davenport gently fanned himself with the slip of paper and unconsciously repeated the sentence of his interrupted cogitation, \" the whole of the success would depend upon the confederate.\" Then he suddenly stopped, and his hand went mechanically up to his"], [311, "Patrician Club. 303 eyebrow. \" He cannot get himself packed in a case like the Dutchman,\" he said, almost aloud, \" for he will assuredly try to cross to-night, and there is no time nor opportunity for such a ruse. He knows that Daly has seen him with his beard off, and that I would recognize him like that at a glance ; besides his height would tell against him in no matter what disguise. He has sent for his confederate to devise something new, something without a precedent, an original mode of packing.\" A diabolical smile of delight played on Davenport's lips. \" In whatever way they pack you, my man, you'll be damaged in the handling before you reach your destination ; I'll take care of that,\" he chuckled. And, confident once more that his enemy would not escape him, Davenport felt more composed than he had been since the Sunday afternoon. v A little after two Davenport became aware of a man who was eyeing him somewhat critically, and immediately afterwards stepped"], [312, "304 The Mystery of the up, touching his hat respectfully. \" Are you Mr. Davenport ? \" he asked, and on an affir mative nod from the detective took a small note from his pocket and handed it to him. Davenport recognized Masters' handwriting, and the messenger turned out to be one of the four plain-clothes constables posted in the Priory Road. \" I have left Daly in Canterbury,\" wrote Masters, \" and followed Captain Wardlaw home. Shall I come to you or remain where I am ? \u2014 Masters.\" Davenport considered for a moment. \" Tell Masters to come to me here,\" he said at last, \" and let two of you take his place. Don't lose sight of Wardlaw ; if he stirs, follow him both of you, and let the two others con tinue to watch the house. If necessary, let one of you come and report to me. It will be all over by twelve to-night.\" Half an hour later Masters stood by his side. The information vouchsafed by the latter was scanty indeed. From the moment Lord Brackelonde entered the hotel until Masters had left to accompany Captain Wardlaw"], [313, "Patrician Club. 305 back to Dover his Lordship had not stirred. He was there in his own name ; Masters had ascertained that from the head porter, and there had been two telegrams for him during Tuesday. The interview with Captain Wardlaw had been a long one. Captain Wardlaw had gone to the station full half an hour before the train started. He had inquired for the station-master, and the two had conversed together for more than a quarter of an hour, though, apparently, they had never met before to-day. Both Masters and Daly had independently of one another come to the conclusion that the attempt to get away would be made to-night and not post poned until next Friday, when, in the ordinary rotation, the Seamew would cross again from Dover to Calais. When asked by Davenport to give a more definite reason for his opinion, Masters failed to do so; nevertheless he stuck to his text. Then he added that Daly felt so convinced of the same thing that he had wired for the nag he had left at Faver sham on the Sunday, and had sent him vol. 11. x"], [314, "The Mystery of the 306 (Masters) back with Captain Wardlaw in stead of coming himself. When Masters left Canterbury the horse had not come. For more than four hours after this every- thing seemed at a standstill ; then, about seven, the Seamew moored along the quay, and began loading the same kind of cargo that had given rise to Davenport's reflections in the morning with regard to instances of historical escapes. Look where he would, though, he sailed to perceive the faintest indi- cation of such an attempt to be made at present. Most of the cases were absolutely too small to contain a human being of ordi- nary size, in no matter how cramped a position. They were, moreover, all in- scribed with the names of well-known firms in large, stencilled letters, and displayed a conspicuous trade mark. There could be no possible doubt of their contents. In a little while Captain Wardlaw made his appearance \u2014rather early, as Davenport considered, \u2014 and leisurely crossed the gangway. Daven-"], [315, "Patrician Club. 307 port had not taken his eye off the vessel, and felt confident that, with the exception of the commander, no one had gone on board ; nor had any of the crew come ashore. Davenport's surprise at Wardlaw's early appearance was soon dispelled, when, after the lapse of a few minutes, he beheld him step ashore again. He had not left the deck during that interval, and Davenport had noticed his giving some orders with regard to the disposal of the merchandise, though he was too far off to hear what was being said. As time wore on Davenport's excitement became appalling. Wardlaw had disappeared without leaving him the slightest clue whereon to act, without the faintest hope that action would be of the least avail, and this \" masterly inactivity,\" however much it might suit the plans of one man, was almost killing the other. Every now and then Davenport reeled as if overcome by drink, and had to steady himself lest he should drop to the ground. Though neither Daly nor the watchpost in the Priory Road gave signs of x 2"], [316, "308 The Mystery of the life, Davenport felt confident that the plot hatched by his enemy and his former yacht master was progressing, and that he, in the event of their success, would have to pay its cost. And yet he was powerless to arrest its progress. Masters was dogging Wardlaw's steps, but apparently without result. At last he descried him coming towards him in the distance. He took out his watch ; it was a quarter to ten. In a very little while the London trains would be thundering along the quay and disgorging their passengers, and hope would be deferred again. Masters' face did not look hopeful. \" He's been walking up and down the town station all the while talking to the station-master,\" said Masters. No one joined them ? \" asked Davenport. No one.\" \" Do you mean to say that no one spoke to them all that while, for Wardlaw has been gone more than two hours ? \" \" No, I didn't mean that,\" stuttered Masters, tilting his hat forward and rubbing"], [317, "Patrician Club. 309 the back of his head. \" Two porters came up just before Wardlaw left the station-master, for I came along with him. They seemed to want some orders from the station-master, but I fancy Wardlaw gave them. I was too far away to hear what he said. The porters were trundling a truck with a brougham on it towards the tunnel. Why, here it comes!\" At the same moment an open truck with a brougham on it stopped on the rails near where they were standing. Immediately afterwards Captain Wardlaw bustled on board and began to direct the men who were working the crane. In a few minutes the carriage was suspended in the air, and in another minute it was safely deposited on the deck, where a space had evidently been left open for it. A light came into Davenport's eyes. \" Run for your life to the Ship Hotel, pay my bill, and get my bag. Here's the money.\" Davenport stood perfectly still, his eyes almost starting from their sockets, his hand"], [318, "The Mystery of the 310 mechanically tugging at his neckcloth, for his breath refused to come. All of a sudden he felt someone touch him on the shoulder, and on looking round found Daly standing by his side. \"Get you on board,\" gasped the latter; \" he is there.\" \"I know,\" he answered; \"but how do you know ? \" \" I followed him and Wakeford all the way from Canterbury on horseback, but my horse stumbled when half way ; I ran the rest, but had no means of wiring. He is in a brougham, which they will sling on board directly.\" \" They have done it already. \" Then get on board. Shall I come with you ? \"No, thank you; I'll confront him alone in mid-Channel, where he cannot get away, for Wardlaw may have got him out of the brougham already and be hiding him. Besides I shall want you to wire to the Commissary of Police at the Gare Maritime,"], [319, "Patrician Club. 311 Calais, to meet me \u2014 to come on board the moment the Seamew lies alongside. I'll bring him back at three to-morrow morning. Can you write French ? No ? Well give me a pencil and your pocket book, and copy exactly what I write. Stay till I am on board, and then send it off immediately.\" Scarcely had Davenport finished writing when the mail train came steaming on to the quay. \" There's no time to wait for my bag ; I'll not want it. Good-bye.\" With this he crossed the gangway. He was the first passenger that got on board. A quarter of an hour later the Seamew had got under weigh. During that quarter of an hour between his setting foot on the vessel and its depar ture Davenport stood motionless by the side of the apparently hermetically closed brougham, deaf to the conversations around him, insensible to the bustling of the crew, blind to any and every thing except that one"], [320, "The Mystery of the 312 object. For nigh upon twenty-four years he had not met his enemy face to face, and the moment for doing so had come at last. He had but to stretch forth his hand, open that door, and the enemy would be in his grasp. But was it wise to do so amidst all this bustle ? He decided that it was not, and to wait till comparative calm prevailed. He, moreover, expected that the door would be fastened from within, and that his summons to open it would be opposed by Captain Wardlaw. So he waited in silence. It was a bright, moonlight night, with a fresh breeze astern. The steamer had been going very fast for about twenty minutes, and the lights of Dover were growing fainter. Davenport took out his watch. The time had come. He was about to ask one of the crew to summon the captain, when he heard a familiar voice behind him address him by name \u2014 his real name, the name which until the previous Friday he had heard so seldom during his period of exile. \"James!\""], [321, "Patrician Club. 313 He turned sharply round, and staggered backward. The speaker was Mr. Walter Greybridge. \"What brings you here, Walter?\" he gasped. \"We are acting upon your instructions, seeing that you would not forego your re venge. We are going into exile.\" The tears started to Davenport's eyes. \" I am sorry for them and you. I am more sorry still for Mr. Richard Clynborough. The parting from the woman he loved so dearly must have been very painful.\" \"There was no parting; he was married to Mary this morning, and they are all here now.\" \" Great God ! On board this ship ?\" The banker's earlier words had evidently conveyed no idea to Davenport's mind of that particular fact. The banker merely nodded. Davenport put both his hands on his old friend's shoulders. \" Then, for Heaven's sake, Walter, keep them out of the way."], [322, "The Mystery of the 314 There is no time to say more ; but keep them out of the way, and when we get to Calais get them ashore at once. Go, go ! or I will not answer for the consequences.\" It was in vain that Mr. Greybridge tried to say another word. Davenport positively pushed him forward, and when he had dis appeared, called a sailor to his side. \" Give this card to Captain Wardlaw, and say that I am waiting for him here, and must see him at once.\" The vessel was going at full speed before the breeze, which had stiffened. In another moment Captain Wardlaw came up. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" he asked, with somewhat exaggerated politeness. \" You must tell me quickly, for I am wanted elsewhere.\" \" I'll not detain you long, Captain Ward law. I have a warrant for one of your passengers, and in the Queen's name I re quire your help to find him. Here is my warrant.\""], [323, "Patrician Club. 315 \" Frederick Marmaduke Stalforth, Mar quis of Brackelonde,\" said Captain Wardlaw, pretending to read the document, after having leisurely adjusted his glasses. \"Yes, I know Lord Brackelonde ; but he is not on this ship.\" They were standing on the port side of the deck forward of the bridge, and close to the carriage on which Davenport now laid his hand. \" He is in here,\" he said, trying the door, which refused to yield ; \"and I demand that you open this door.\" Captain Wardlaw tried to parley, but in answer to his remark Davenport snatched a wedge from off the hatch-cover, battered in the wooden window-blind, and turned the handle from the inside. At the same instant the opposite door flew open, and with one bound Lord Brackelonde cleared the bulwark. Almost before he touched the water, Daven port was after him. There was a sudden cry of \" Man overboard,\" and everybody on deck rushed to the side. They only heard one"], [324, "316 The Mystery of the despairing shriek. The two men had disap peared beneath the starboard paddle-wheel. A quarter of an hour later the steamer pro ceeded on its way, all efforts to find the bodies having proved fruitless. As Captain Wardlaw returned to the bridge the passen gers crowded round him. \" Have you any idea, captain, who were the unfortunate men ? \" asked a gentleman, stepping forward. \" I am afraid I have more than an idea,\" replied Captain Wardlaw. \" One was Lord Brackelonde, the other a Mr. Jasper Daven port. His Lordship bravely jumped over board to save a fellow-man.\" A heart-rending cry was heard from the back of the group ; a lady had fainted. Captain Wardlaw pushed the passengers aside ; then, after a long, startled look, he rose from his kneeling posture. \"You had better leave her to her friends ; it is Lord Brackelonde's daughter,\" he said.
