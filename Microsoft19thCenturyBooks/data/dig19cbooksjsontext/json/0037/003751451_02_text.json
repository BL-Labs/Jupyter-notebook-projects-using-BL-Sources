Never theless, she nerved herself up to insist upon this offer being accepted, or her friends the Merediths should have no as sistance from her. And as if to reward her for allowing Prudence to guide Bene volence, the following event occurred : \u2014 A furious peal at the door-bell \u2014 answered by Anne ; a parley at the door, in which a rough voice demanded the gigantic sum of eight shillings and sevenpence for a parcel. John and Emily, attracted by the monstrosity of such a demand, went out to join in the colloquy, followed by young John and all his sisters. \" Anne,\" exclaimed Emily, losing sight of the sum of eight shillings and seven pence at sight of the box \u2014 \" give the porter"], [9, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 3 some supper and beer. How could you carry so heavy a thing ? \" \"It bean't heavy, missus, but I be dry.\" \" Oh ! go, go directly \u2014 dear John, what a box ! Really eight-and-sevenpence is very cheap.

Oh ! how stupid I am, the direction is in my sister's handwriting. Now we shall have news of Adeline.\" The opening of that box was never for gotten by any one. On the top lay five little black beaver hats, each with a long curling black feather, and strings of bright carnation colour.

She paraded her little flock in their black hats and scarlet cloaks in the face of every one whose opinion she re spected; and cordially joined in the remark of Betty, Miss Charles's maid \u2014 \" That them dresses of the parson's likely bairns was a deal more to her taste than the flashy whites and purples of the Robartses, which 'ull be black afore next Soonday, mark me, Mistress Nurse.\" Moreover Miss Nest comported herself proudly in honour of a cloak down to her ankles, and a hat with a straight brim, just like a lady ; which caused the admiring and still enamoured Jeffreys to confide to his mother \u2014 That he really did believe his Nessie"], [12, "THE VALLEY OF 6 would grow up to be the biggest beauty ever seen.\" ii In which sentiment kind Mrs. Dawson cordially agreed. The jealousy long existing between the nurses, heads of the nursery department of the Robartses and Leslies, did not extend to the mothers. Emily did not know of the existence of a feeling called envy, and Mrs. Robarts was very glad to see those poor little children warmly clothed at last. The Robartses rented a large house while their own was building. As for the little Leslies, Nest was rather too thoughtless, Pearl too wise, the little ones too young to think much of their fine clothes ; but they doted on Adeline's presents, and must perforce carry them about, wherever they went, to show them Most especially to the Miss Hills. Their lovely house had been spared by the pit-"], [13, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 7 men. And there young John, Nest, and Pearl might often be found, especially when little domestic events occurred which rendered it desirable to keep tbe parsonage quiet. If, at their youthful age, visions of para dise occurred to their imagination, the Miss Hills' garden would have been the type from which they drew the pictures. The sweetest and earliest flowers were to be found there \u2014 the rarest, the most curious. Fruit in such luscious clusters and golden profusion, that there was no need to restrain their own longings after it to keep some for the little ones at home (a Leslie peculiarity) ; there was sufficient for them and to spare.

A solitary rose-bush, that bore white roses, had the pain to witness its fair blossoms grow black by evening, which, daily inflicted, caused the mother plant such constant sorrow, she was gradually pining away. But in their own gardens at the Miss Hills', what delicious things grew for them! and how did the hearts of the good ladies expand, hearing the happy shouts of the children, as they discovered the tiny leaves"], [15, "9 A HUNDRED FIRES. of newly-born plants raising their delicate heads above the soil. \" Such pretty things do the children ot God grow, my Pearl,\" would Miss Hill say, \" planting the seed of their earthly bodies in the grave, and rising up to Heaven fair and spotless.\" And what excellent things were in the house ! \" Papa,\" said John, \" Miss Hill draws and paints all the wild flowers of the field so correctly I wish to take them up to smell ; and, more than all, she writes their Latin names beneath.\" \" And, papa,\" said Nest, \" we sit under the shade of a tree in the drawing room \u2014 it has large leaves, and long, white flowers.\" \"But, papa,\" lisped Pearl, \"my godmamma has a shell, which I put to my ear, and it speaks to me in the speech of the sea!\""], [16, "10 THE VALLEY OF \"And what does it say to you, my P.P. ? \" P.P. was Mr. Leslie's abbreviation for Pretty Pearl. \" It says, ever and ever, that it has wonderful things in its depths, which some times it casts upon the shore for us to see.

And it was thus that the love of the beau tiful and curious in nature grew so familiar to the little Leslies ; and the thoughts of the Miss Hills' garden remain to this day, as that spot where Art and Nature met to gether, and endeavoured to outvie each other. And from their intercourse with the Miss"], [18, "12 THE VALLEY OF Hills there arose the desire to excel in what ever they did, besides opening to them the many delightful occupations of collecting rare things \u2014 the necessity of classing them \u2014 the beauty of order in their arrangement \u2014 the search after one thing engendering the pur suit of another. And having taken these wishes into their hearts from earliest childhood, there was but little room left in the brains of the young Leslies for tempers, passions, delusions. They were little unsophisticated creatures, earnest about their employments, and simple in their manners. \" I thank God for my good children ! I have no trouble with them ; on the contrary, great delight from them, and satisfaction. Oh ! Lord, hear my prayer, and preserve them from sickness, casualty, and vice, for Jesus Christ's sake.

Mr. Leslie had asked another question of Lord Bernard \u2014 namely, the permission to take more pupils. The two young Bernards were about to be sent to school ; and if with the salary he received from teaching them he was uncomfortably straitened for money, he would not be able to manage at all without. \" My wife is very kind in presenting me"], [20, "14 THE VALLEY OF every year with a little daughter,\" remarked Mr. Leslie ; \" and they are such good, docile little things, that it appears to me they can never be unwelcome ; yet, work for them I must, or they will all starve.\" \" I assure you,\" interrupted Lord Bernard, \"my wife and I agree that there cannot be too many of them. Indeed, it would be rank treason against Mrs. Leslie's beautiful mother pride in them, to conceive so base an idea. And thus thinking, perhaps, you will accept, in the spirit with which it is offered, the salary necessary for a curate. I do not wish to deprive you of taking pupils : you will find it imperative to do so. But, with the increasing religious wants of an increasing population, I am justified in insisting upon defraying the expenses of a curate.\" So John did as he was bid \u2014 the more es- pecially as, Lord Bernard remarked, in any other profession he would have received some reward of honour or money for his conduct"], [21, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 15 during the riots. Also, John was sensible, and not Quixotic. It was trouble and pain struggling on to keep free from debt: this was a feeling from which he considered a clergyman should be exempt. If he was straitened at home, pinched id every way, how could he preach with that freedom and power that only a soul unburthened by earthly care could command ? He went home to tell Emily the good news, who received it as a matter of course. What was there that John ought not to have ? It was his due. \" But still, Emily, this generosity will hardly suffice. I should like, if it would not be troublesome to you, to take pupils \u2014 here \u2022in the house.\" \"Excellent, John ! How very wrong in me not to think of this before ; \u2014 our house so large, too.\" \"It will be much extra trouble to you, Emily \""], [22, "16 THE VALLEY OF \"Of course, and quite right too.

Furthermore, Sir Edward and Lady Armitage made a solemn compact to visit them the following year. It was a pang to part from young John. But he was to go to a school so near the Armitages, that he could always spend Sunday with them ; and in the wonderful happiness this gave both himself and Adeline the father and mother stifled their own regrets.

Now, Jane, don't weep and move away.

A powerful appeal to their feelings, put in the form of a threat that she would certainly tell Miss Leslie, the first minute she set eyes on her, of their extraordinary naughtiness, restored them to a state of sober decorum ; meantime the nursery was not the only scene of change.

Also a very pleasing and gratifying addition was made to the wardrobes of the Miss Leslies by their grandmamma, in the form of spotless white frocks, whose beauty was further enhanced by pink sashes, the ribbon for which had been presented by Lady Bernard.

So no wonder that, under all these unwonted excitements, even Wilsy's threats proved of little power. On the very day of the expected arrival that good woman, in despair, had locked up Nest and Pearl in their own little room, with each a pocket-handkerchief to hem. Gwladys and Gwendoline were put into opposite corners, cutting up old papers into lighters or spills ; Lily sat in her own little chair, like a lady, keeping a watchful and sisterly eye upon the baby. Otherwise, but for this masterly disposi tion of her forces, Wilsy would have had them on the Cinder Tip, looking out for the carriage, every minute that she turned her back upon them. Fortunately, papa, wandering that way, took them out for a walk, and soothed down their excited little brains by various interesting stories \u2014 such as the wonderful history of \"Tom Thumb,\" that brave and D2"], [42, "36 THE VALLEY OF sensible \"Cheshire Man and his Cheese,\" the \" Hypocritical old Beggar of Bethnal Green, and his darling daughter, the pretty Bessie\" \u2014 all interspersed with never-failing anecdotes of the dear Adeline.

A splashing, dashing, noisy carriage was heard rattling up to the door, evidently heavily laden, and drawn by four horses. Then began to appear that singular anomaly, prevalent in affectionate disposi tions. Eager, anxious, and unruly (as it seemed in that orderly nursery) the Miss Leslies had been to see their sister, they"], [43, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 37 now all blushed with shyness, and shrunk into their chairs, as if to hide themselves beneath their cane bottoms for safety. Their hearts beat at the various sounds running through the house, especially if a footstep neared the nursery-door. None ventured to speak. A long time appeared to elapse \u2014 so long, they began to wonder if any carriage had come; or was it pos- sible that Adeline did not know she had six little sisters upstairs? Ere this grave question found an answer, the door bounced open, a sort of flushed and animated Anne (an appearance totally unknown in the real Anne) pops her head in at the door, \" Children to go down immegently, Wilson,\" and disappears. If the grave and imperturbable Anne was thus transformed by the arrival of their Adeline, what would become of them, thought the six little ex pectant sisters, as they were ushered down by Wilsy in her usual style, Nest at the"], [44, "38 THE VALLEY OF head, upholding the tottering steps of the baby ? When the door was open, and they fairly within, their shy eyes dared hardly raise themselves. The one first irresistible glance had shown them a lovely lady, all covered with blue silk and white lace, a tall, grave gentleman, a young and rosy face, beaming with happiness, but surely too tall, too like a little lady, too gaily dressed for their Adeline. But, lo ! that pretty, blooming face has darted forward, is kissing them all. She has hardly to stoop to the great Nest ; but she goes down on her knees, regardless of her pretty silk frock, to kiss the little ones a dozen times over. Then an overwhelming tide of feeling begins to break through the crust of shyness. With sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks, Pearl whispers \u2014 \"Are you Adeline \u2014 our sister Adeline?\""], [45, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 39 \" Yes, yes, darling, I am your own Adeline.\" The spell was broken. Forgetting mother, father, uncle, or aunt, they flung their arms round their long absent sister, where ever they could find anything to clasp, while a little chorus of joyful cries filled the room with its pleasant sound. \" This is Adeline, our Adeline, our own eldest sister. We love you, Adeline ; will you love us ? You are so good, and we are very often naughty; but we will do everything you like. Our own sister, our Adeline, that we have lost so long. We have always loved you best of all of us, Adeline \u2014 will you love us ? \" This scene of genuine nature took all the audience by surprise. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Leslie knew that their children were any otherwise than shy little obedient things, that always seemed best pleased to do as they were told."], [46, "40 THE VALLEY OF But as for Lady Armitage, whose heart was touched as by electricity with any display of feeling, she could not restrain her tears. \" Never, never again, will I deprive these little darlings of their sister for so long a period. The most beautiful sight I ever saw, the most touching ! Edward, shall you ever forget it ? \" \" Never,\" he answered ; \" their half fear lest it should not be Adeline, and the burst of nature when they were certain, was most touching and delightful ! \" \" Now go, dears,\" said their mother, \" and take Adeline with you to see Wilson.\" With a buzz of delight they clustered round her as bees round their queen, and hurried her off to their own domain. \" Never, never shall I forget this sight,\" exclaimed Lady Armitage ; \" and but that I think they will be happier together for a time, I would not suffer them out of"], [47, "41 A HUNDRED FIRES. my sight. But, sister, bid them re turn.\" This being promised, the party dispersed to change their travelling dresses, and pre pare for dinner, previous to the announce ment of which the little sisterhood made their appearance, clustering more lovingly than ever around their little queen-bee \u2014 for shyness had given place to unbounded confidence. Having now eyes for other sights than Adeline, they began to gaze upon Lady Armitage, with a mixture of both admira tion and awe. Her gorgeous dress, her rich ornaments, and her peculiar beauty made them, from Nest downwards, stare at their aunt with distended eyes and open mouths. \" You are dear little affectionate things, certainly,\" remarked their aunt ; \" but, sister, there is not one to be compared to Adeline. This one is pretty\" (pointing to Pearl), \" and this is a little darling \""], [48, "42 THE VALLEY OF (kissing Lily) ; \" but what a monster of a child you are, my dear. What is your name ? Nest ! \u2014 ah ! yes, of course, you are the second ; but you grow too fast \u2014 remember you are much younger than Adeline, and, of course, must keep your proper place below her.\" \" Yes, aunt,\" was the low answer. \" But who is this, all eyes ? \" \"She is Gwladys, aunt,\" responded Ade line, coming to the relief of her little sisters. \"Does she not deserve her name, she looks so happy and bright. And this is Gwendoline, who you must know is very clever, as you can judge by her quick little face.\" \" My dear child, they may be all that you say, in fact I do not doubt it ; but these too have not a single good feature in their faces but their eyes, and they are much too large and black to please me.

So you will excuse my saying, I do not admire any of them very much. Their complexions are not sufficiently clear to please me. By-the-by, my dear sister, what a horrible place you live in ! I could not exist in such an atmosphere. Such a road leading to the parsonage \u2014 though I must own this is a very nice house, and everything is beau tiful within it.

The awe that mingled with their admiration of their aunt was fast smothering the latter feeling, and, in a subdued whisper, when they were safe in the window, Nest asked \u2014 \" Is our aunt kind to you ? \" \" Yes, darling, very.\" Pearl. \u2014 \" But mamma never speaks to us like that.\" \" She does not mean it unkindly, dear.\" Gwladys. \u2014 \" I'll tell you what, I wouldn't care for her ! \" \" Oh ! yes, my happy little Gwladys, you would, if you knew her as well as I do.\" Gwendoline. \u2014 \" When I am as big as you, nobody shall order me like that.\" \" Then you shall never grow as big as me, my Gwenny \u2014 you shall be a nice, funny-looking little girl always. You must none of you be afraid of her, my darlings, for she is so good and kind to your Adeline.\""], [51, "45 A HUNDRED FIRES. \" Then we will love her, indeed we will.\" After dinner Lady Armitage insisted that all the children should stand in a row, that she might see the regular gradation in which they fell. \" I must say, sister, you may be proud of such a number of fine children ; and if it were not for Nest, towering up so high, and spoiling the line from herself to Pearl, they make a pretty show as they stand there.

No, not for any of these. They may have double all these perfections ; you would not be vain. Miss Charles may repeat any idle tale against them, with an exaggeration that utterly smothers the original malice ; you would laugh. But John, your only son, your one boy.

Emily, anxious of course, not only to make every one as happy as herself, but desirous to prove to her neighbours and friends that nothing had been said too favourable of Lady Armitage, asked every one to dinnner. And indeed they would have thought her very unkind not to do so. Rumours of the fashionable life Lady Armitage led \u2014 visions of the wonderful modes she would bring, of which they had had more than visions, ocular demonstration, in her pre sents to her sister \u2014 the repeated disappoint ments as to their arrival \u2014 all combined to"], [55, "49 A HUNDRED FIRES. make the advent of the Armitages a mat ter which concerned every one, far and near.

On the con trary, she confided to Lady Bernard that, much as she feared the set of people with whom her sister associated were by no means worthy of her, the reality was far worse than she had expected. \" Certainly she has yourself, but then you are often absent. Again I allow, those delightful Miss Hills, and their fine old father, are society that fulfils every wish one could desire.

Look at your sister's face, and then see what it may become.\" To Lady Armitage no music was so grate ful as her sister's praise, but the more Lady Bernard spoke of her virtues and worth the more she lamented her being where she was. As Lady Armitage had no idea of not saying what she thought, the third dinner-party had not passed away before she was as unpopular as her sister was the contrary. Not her beauty, nor her magnificent dresses, nor her many accomplishments, which she was most compliant in displaying for their amusement, saved her from being considered a proud, imperious, fine lady. Miss Charles was full of acrimonious resentment against her. Mrs. Dawson, with her kind and gentle heart, was heard congratulating herself and somebody that E 2"], [58, "52 THE VALLEY OF Lady Armitage was not Mrs. Leslie. Mrs. Robarts admired and liked her beyond everything, and would sit for hours imbib ing all sorts of ideas and rules that Lady Armitage deemed necessary for the education of a young lady ; who in return thought Mrs. Robarts rather a sensible woman, fully aware of the advantages of refinement and accomplishments. One good effect all this had upon Jef freys Dawson was to stifle a dawning notion that flitted through his mind, of returning to his first love and forsaking Nest. But, acting, I suppose, on the same principle as the fox did by the grapes, he declared to his mother, \"Adeline was a stuck-up thing\"\u2014 (fancy if the six little sisters had heard him thus talking of their Adeline ; he would certainly have lost all chance of Nest for ever) \u2014 \" and that Nest was not only a great deal handsomer,"], [59, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 53 but would be a great deal bigger, when she grew up.\" Mrs. Dawson rose and kissed him on the spot.

Gwenny took mightily after her grandmother, and if she did not manage the turbulent Nest, or the spirited Pearl, she twisted Gwladys round her finger, and it was through no fault of hers she did not do the same by all. At present, however, the result of the con ference was that they left the room together ; and, shortly after, Lady Armitage was inter rupted in the very middle of a duet with Adeline, by repeated little taps at the door. \"Come in!\""], [62, "56 THE VALLEY OF The door opened slowly. \" Come in,\" she repeated, hastily ; and, nothing daunted by her quickness of speech, Gwladys and Gwendoline made their ap pearance hand-in-hand.

Gwladys and Gwendoline were considered heroines after this, and Mr. Leslie talked with great gravity of sending them on all sorts of messages to different people. Among others to beg Miss Charles to tell a tale \"as it was told to her.\" And now occurred a great event in their small lives. In honour of Adeline's arrival, the Miss Hills gave a juvenile ball. The simplicity with which they had been brought up led them to form the wildest conjectures as to what would happen to them on that eventful evening, and there fore their anticipations were of unmixed delight. Whether they were all to play at ball, or only to drink tea, or merely to play in the usual manner, or that there was to be something wonderfully un-"], [65, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 59 common, all formed part of their conjec tures, but took nothing from their happi ness. There was one anticipation no one could take from them : they would be able to show off their Adeline to the admiring eyes of all the little playfellows they knew. She would play and sing- to them, and they already in imagination heard the admiring plaudits, and felt beforehand it would be almost impossible to refrain from proclaiming aloud, \" She is our Adeline ! \" They pictured to themselves how she would look in her cambric frock, and her white kid shoes, her beautiful gloves, and her broad blue satin braces passed round each arm and crossed behind. Her dark brown hair, though cut short, was the brightest and smoothest ever seen, and was kept in its proper position by a round tortoise-shell comb, the shape of her head. And then her face ! \u2014 the skin so fair ! the"], [66, "60 THE VALLEY OF cheeks so rosy ! the eyes so blue ! the mouth so pretty ! \u2014 and certainly, whatever the little Leslies might think, Adeline was an excellent specimen of a fine blooming girl of fourteen. So occupied were they in thinking about Adeline, her dress and appearance, that until they saw five little white frocks just like hers, five little sets of blue ribbons to match, five little pairs of white kid shoes with bright buckles, and five little pairs of gloves, they had no conception of unmitigated happiness. To be dressed like Adeline, thus everybody would see at once that she was their sister \u2014 who could have ordered, devised, executed, carried out such a master-stroke of pleasure? Of course, who could it be but Aunt Armitage? They blushed guiltily, thinking how they feared in their inmost hearts she was not quite kind. In the meantime, poor Mrs. Robarts"], [67, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 61 was undergoing such a series of domestic evils, she heartily wished the Miss Hills on the top of Vesuvius, for doing so evil a thing by her as to give a children's ball. In the first place, Ellen could not go; Doctor Dawson feared for the conse quences. She was very delicate \u2014 still more wayward. They were not naturally bad tempered as a family, but over-indulgence and unrebuked pettishness were fast making them so. It was Mrs. Robarts's intention to keep Ellen in ignorance of the coming festivity, that she might not injure her constitution by fretting to join in it. Offending her eldest brother, Gustavus, or Gus, as he was familiarly termed by everyone, he thought himself justified in retaliating by inform ing her of the event, and her intended non-participation therein. Actuated by the double motive of proving him wrong, and"], [68, "62 THE VALLEY OF ardently desirous to go, she fretted so much, that her mother, alarmed, sent for Dr. Dawson. He, perceiving that her dis appointment was as inimical to her health as the risk of going, gave the desired permission. \"But I warn you, Miss Ellen, that had you been six years old, instead of sixteen, I should have recommended your mamma to give you a little wholesome chastisement. At your age one might expect you to consider her feelings, instead of your own. These remarks being as intelligible as Greek to Miss Ellen, she paid no heed to them ; but, turning to her mother, said : \u2014 \"Mamma, may I wear your pearl neck lace? Maria and Jane have both worn it, and I never have.\" So Dr. Dawson went away, reading in the mother's face another care. He felt"], [69, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 63 morally certain that evening the whole of the Miss Robartses would quarrel as to which should wear their mother's neck lace \u2014 not so much from love of it, or vanity, but that they might be the fa voured one, and gain a victory over all the others. That fusillade of words, \"You did,\" \"I didn't,\" \" I will,\" \" You shan't,\" \" Get out,\" \" Begone,\" was constantly heard in the Ro barts's nursery. But, as the details of the Leslie children wax voluminous, 'tis as well not to add the naughtinesses of another nursery still more numerous. The elder girls were very pretty, slender, and elegant-looking, with long throats, and drooping shoulders, delicate features, and soft, almond-shaped blue eyes. They had no perceptible character about them ; but an incessant contradiction of each other, and a perpetual little giggle in company. One, named Eliza Mary, had an idio-"], [70, "64 THE VALLEY OF syncrasy wholly her own: she never lost an opportunity of having a comfortable cry upon the slightest provocation ; and by so doing was the least good-looking among them, owing to weak eyes. The dressing of the Miss and Master Robartses began about two o'clock, conse quently some had to be re-dressed ; for what with their own individual restlessness, and the disposition prevalent among them to do despite to each other, many mis haps occurred ; but by six o'clock Mrs. Robarts, weary, feverish, and anxious, col lected her flock together, and, with a sigh of relief, took the four youngest with her, sending the four elder ones in another carriage, with the governesses, and departed for the wished-for haven \u2014 Captain Hill's. Two babies were left behind, as she had now ten children. On the road they over took Mrs. Wilson, the Roman-nosed par sonage nurse, in attendance upon Nest,"], [71, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 65 Pearl, and John ; the two young ladies, in their anxiety to keep their frocks clean, were regardless of a bountiful dis play of ankles, which caused that amiable creature, Gus, to shout from the carriage window, as long as he was in sight, \" Legs, legs ! \u2014 oh ! what legs ! \" which ap peared to his sisters to be remarkably witty of him, as they giggled in chorus. Shortly a handsome coach passed them, containing the owners, Sir Edward and Lady Armitage, Mrs. Leslie, Adeline, and some little Leslies. Anon came the Castle car riage, with its four gray horses, ridden by postilions, in scarlet jackets, black caps, and gold tassels, from either window of which might be descried the round, won dering, and delighted black eyes of Gwladys and Gwendoline Leslie.

But, as the amusements of that day were somewhat different from those now in vogue, it may be as well to give some little account of this celebrated party of those dear, kind Miss Hills.

As the groups clustered together beforehand, Wilsy had the proud satisfaction of perceiv ing that all the Miss Robartses were not dressed faultlessly alike in cambric muslin dresses, as she had been privately informed was to be the case \u2014 dresses of extreme fashion, and got up regardless of expense \u2014 (we know, dear reader, the reason why) \u2014 whereas all the little Leslies were one the counterpart of the other ; (woe betide any of them had they offered to stir from their"], [75, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 69 chairs after Wilsy had dressed them). And the group was extremely effective, always making a little exception in the case of Nest, who would grow so tall, and whose hair would curl, in spite of its almost being bastinadoed every day with a very hard brush. Wilsy was extremely gratified, and broadly smiled \u2014 a mood most uncommon to her ; but Emily \u2014 Mrs. Leslie the mother \u2014 well, she told no one but John what she thought, and had we time to peep into his journal we might discover how vain she was, after all. Skilfully as Miss Hill marshalled all the young ones into the barn, Walter and Frank Bernard, highly privileged at all times, con trived to get a seat each on one side of Pearl, who had a bewitching little disdain ful way with her, most provocative in its effects. Jeffreys Dawson \u2014 who had not yet set out, on that long walk of his through the hospitals \u2014 stood in a corner"], [76, "70 THE VALLEY OF of the barn, in an attitude of much grace and effect, as he thought, his elbow against a post, and his fingers (he was proud of his hand) running negligently through his hair. Now, had his hair curled, the effect might have been picturesque ; but being remarkably straight, damp, and whity-brown in colour, it fell in odd star ing clumps, not unlike pounds of candles hanging from a nail. With a tender and absorbed gaze in his great blue eyes, he endeavoured to make them speak soft mes sages of affection to his lady-love, Nest, who took no further notice of this homage to her charms than to imagine he was practising the art of squinting, a talent \u2014 her great aversion \u2014 Gus Robarts excelled and delighted in. When Gus was not thinking of anything more pleasant to his juvenile imagination, he condescended to talk to Pearl, and assure her of so much of his regard, that when he and she were"], [77, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 71 grown up he might, if she looked pretty sharp, make her Mrs. Gus \u2014 an assurance received with quiet disdain by the young lady, high indignation by Nest, and tearful moans by the little sisters. It was known, painfully known, to the small sisterhood, that what Gus said he would do, was done. Nevertheless, we are all now in the barn, at one end of which is a great curtain. This being drawn up, wonderful and extraordinary dogs appear, walking on their hind legs, dressed as ladies and gen tlemen, acting a play. What those dogs did was not forgotten for many a day, and the different heads of nursery departments took occasion long after to read lessons of obedience and pro priety, caused solely by the excellent de portment and morals of these dogs. No sooner had the dogs finished their play, when a marvellous peacock was dis covered, that arose out of a small box,"], [78, "72 THE VALLEY OF flapped its wings, screamed, spread its tail, picked up some crumbs of bread, collapsed, and sunk into its box again. As for any of the little Leslies believing that this was not a r^al bird, nothing but a machine, they don't to this day. After the peacock the curtain was again drawn up, and there appeared a pretty boy, seated at a table playing chess. He lifted up his head, he moved his pieces, he rubbed his forehead with his fore-finger, he crossed his legs, and he won a game of chess against Mr. Sabine, the best player in the Valley. Yet he was no boy at all, nothing but the image of a boy. This was much too bewildering for Gwladys and Gwendoline. \" But he has got a jacket and trowsers on,\" says one. \"And he looked at me,\" said the other. \"And he yawned,\" said the first. \"And he has nails on his fingers.\""], [79, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 73 This part of the entertainment was pro vided by Captain Hill. And now came Miss Hill's. She had a magic-lantern, then considered a startling and extraordinary thing. During the pro cess of its performance the mouths of the little spectators expanded as well as their eyes. They began to lose their own in dividuality. A cessation of the magic-lan tern, and a request for some music, sud denly recalled Gwladys and Gwendoline to their senses. Adeline was b\u00b0th t\u00b0 play and sing \u2014 their Adeline. For fear any one in that numerous company should not know this important fact, the adventurous Gwenny persuaded Gwladys to go with her, and, insinuating themselves among the company, announce, in important whispers, the de lightful fact. They succeeded pretty well, meeting the usual fortune of adventurers. Some called"], [80, "74 THE VALLEY OF them \" dear little affectionate things.\" Others stared, and said nothing. Again, some were unpolite, which was not so dis tressing as being unsympathetic. But in one or two instances they were highly ap plauded and kissed.

That young lady generally acted on impulse, and, flying to the rescue, found Gwenny at the extreme verge of endurance. A sounding box on the ear reverbe rated all over the room, followed by a yell from Gus, that made his mother shriek with fear, and fly to his rescue. Not even the love-sick Jeffreys could deny the fact. There was the mark of his angelic Nest's fingers flaming on Bob's delicate skin, and she did not attempt to deny it. On the contrary, she stood there, her arm still in protection wound round the rescued Gwenny, her cheek flushed certainly with shame, but the ray of a flash of indignation was scarcely concealed by the drooping lid. \"My darling, darling boy!

Shouting with glee, Frank and Walter Bernard rushed out to communicate the pleasing fact that Nessie had done perfectly right, and found Mrs. Leslie in the very act of kissing and dismissing her daugh ters.

So Nessie was sad, and felt very ill at ease. \"Pearl, you are a darling,\" said Miss HiU, \" and you shall have that collection of sea-weeds.

At the bottom of a most lively country dance, throwing himself down on a chair to rest and breathe, Walter Bernard's eye fell upon Gus, who, with sulky look, had hid his dis comfiture in a corner. Taking a candle off its socket, the worthy recipient of the box on the ear slyly drew near to Nest, who was standing waiting her turn to dance, the enamoured Jeffreys her partner.

Before they parted, Mr. Leslie made it a sine-qua-non with Lady Armitage, that Ade line should always spend her holidays with her sisters. It had gone to his heart the wild joy of his little ones at seeing one so long lost to them, and their sad but subdued grief at now losing her. Besides, she did them (especially the elder ones) so much good. Nest really looked tidy, and behaved less like a boy, when Adeline was near; while the eager Pearl im bibed music and drawing as fast as her sister could teach her. In parting with his daughter once more, he saw that, though"], [94, "88 THE VALLEY OF kept in such strict order, not one girl in a thousand would have escaped becoming artful and reserved, she obeyed her aunt from love more than fear, and had so bright a face, besides such blooming health, he could not desire more for her than a little relaxation. As for her temper, it was her mother's. Sunshine of heart was her birth right, her gift. The pain of parting was softened to the little affectionate sisters by the knowledge that they should meet again at a definite time, though a year presented the aspect of a lifetime to some of them. Lord Bernard opened the door of his wife's boudoir again to have a conference about the Leslies. \" My dear Kate,\" said he, \" it is more than twelve years since our rector and his wife came amongst us ; are you as much in love with him as ever?\""], [95, "A HDNDRED FIRES. 89 \"Fully so, Henry, and you with her?\" \" Much more so, wife, if you will permit the thought.

Thus it fell out that, one evening at the Castle, Mrs. Leslie found herself, all beam ing as usual, seated at dinner, with the bishop on one side of her, and Lord Ber nard on the other. An honourable posi tion truly. Little did Emily think for what purpose she was placed there. Lady Ber nard had a shrewd idea in her mind, that"], [98, "92 THE VALLEY OF if anyone could spoil her own good fortune it would be Mrs. Leslie. And so far she was justified in her penetration ; for when a person is always watching for good and for tunate events to befall others, they seldom have time to spread out their own aprons to catch blessings for themselves. If Lady Bernard had offered to make the beloved John an archbishop at once, Emily could not have more fully realized her hopes, all unwotting as she was of any base plot hatch ing against their good fortune.

Her eyes were serene in happiness. Contentment and truth were stamped on her countenance. At this moment Lady Bernard called to Mrs. Leslie to prepare her for seeing all her children at dessert. \" I sent the carriage for them without asking your permission, fearing a refusal, and I hear them arriving now.\" The Bishop explained to Mrs. Leslie that Lady Bernard had taken this liberty at his request. He wished to judge for himself if they were happy and healthy. Emily was not ill-pleased to be made to do what she secretly liked, determinately as she would have said \" No,\" had she been consulted.

The two eldest peeled all the oranges, cut them up, and gave them tidily to the younger ones.

As they neither of them pri vately denied the fact, it was fair to suppose they both said it at one and the same moment.

At the end of three days she lay on Wilsy's arms \u2014 white, almost lifeless, and appa rently in the exhaustion of death. In vain did the anxious mother bend her head to catch the sound of the troubled breathing, that sound, hitherto always so painful to bear, now longed for as the one sign of the child's still being alive. \" Oh, Wilson, she is gone, she is gone ! \" Wilson had no answer to give.

From that hour she throve and grew, and never suffered again from impeded breath. In fact, it was considered that the fit of sickness was an effort of na ture to get rid of the cause of her suf fering.

He was longing to assure himself that his Nessie was really so much re covered as they said, and he required his P. P. every hour of every day. But Emily decided that so kind a pro posal could not be refused. Independent of the benefits her girls would derive, it was allowed that Nest was still very deli cate, and a change to another climate would be especially beneficial.

Emily had never yet learnt to say her nay. About this time Mr. Leslie had the offer of a living in one of the midland counties. He, contrary to Emily's advice, went to see it. For himself he cared not to move, but he thought of his nine daughters, and con sidered it only due to them not to refuse what might be advantageous. He could not disguise from himself that the smoke nui sance became worse and worse ; it might eventually affect their health. He had been offered by Lord Bernard the refusal of one or two other houses, less unpleasantly situ ated, but they none of them were so roomy and commodious as the parsonage. Mr. Leslie went alone to view the capa bilities of this new living to make a home, and to Emily's satisfaction came back deci dedly in favour of remaining where he was.

Very glad was he to be able conscientiously to say, it was better for the whole family to remain where they were. The good Bishop had long been hovering on the verge of the grave ; and anxious as he might be to benefit Mr. Leslie before he died, no fitting opportunity occurred. The livings in his gift were but small ; he thought he did Mr. Leslie the greatest kindness by leaving him still under the eyes and pa tronage of Lord Bernard. There was one thing he executed before he was taken to his last home, which oc curred in the ensuing summer.

He was sin cerely lamented, and by none more than the little inhabitants of the coach-house. There was talk of the Robartses returning home, but they lingered on the journey there. At the end of the year Emily had her tenth daughter, whose real name is not ex actly known to any but her immediate family, for she was always designated Puss, or Pussie, and Miss Pussie. This is sup posed to be generally the name bestowed upon the youngest of the family. So Mr. Leslie approved of it and encouraged it, from which we may conclude that he con sidered ten daughters sufficient for. one family. It is, indeed, somewhat wearisome to the historian to have so many births to record, and an endeavour has been made to gloss over some of them. For instance, Mrs. Robarts's fourteenth child is nearly two"], [311, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 305 years old; and though she has only eleven living, still that is a prodigious quantity of whom to relate the history. It was about this time, also, that Miss Charles had a serious return of her last year's illness ; during which, having made up her mind that her time was come, she did not call upon the prayers of the Church to restore her to health, so much as to be seech forgiveness of her sins. \" Now, ye ken, that's no possible to be,\" remarked Betty ; \" when she has hae sin maist monstrous.\" \" And what may that be ? \" asked Wilsy, her confidante. \"Nae less than an oopsetting o' a' God's commands in regard to her ain kith and kin.

But before they said anything to Miss Charles, with Betty's help the young girl was sought for and found ; not only found, but brought to the parsonage for care and nursing, until Miss Charles was in a fit state to be told. A gentle pale girl, with anxious eyes, as if indeed the world had been very hard upon her; and, strive as she might to do her best in it, she was conscious she had not strength to cope with the harshness of it. Delightful was it to Emily's kind heart to dress her up in a pretty light cotton dress, and to have her down to tea in the drawing room, bidding her make it (Emily had an aversion to that domestic duty) ; still more delightful to see Mr. Leslie, that good blind John, bow so politely, and then whisper quite loud, \"who Emily's pretty little tea maker could be,\" though the poor girl had been with him for two hours in the morning telling her sad little history."], [315, "309 A HUNDRED FIRES. There was a natural gentlewomanly grace about her, that appeared to increase every day, with the perception that she was in her proper sphere, and could enjoy it to her heart's content. Then when Miss Charles came to know, and she was brought face to face with that hard old aunt who had doomed her to ser vitude rather than spare her a mite, Emily and Mr. Leslie were both pleased with the touching sort of self-dignity she assumed. Sullen was Miss Charles \u2014 bearish. \" I shall stay with you, aunt, while you are ill. Then, if it pleases you, I can go away again.\" But she never did go away, as Betty said \u2014 \" T'ould missus wud hae died twenty times but for Miss Bessie\" \u2014 (Betty was most scru pulous in treating the whilom maid-of-all work with the highest respect). \"Naeboddy kna's but wat I may turn oot gran' mysel'"], [316, "310 THE VALLEY OF sum day \u2014 for I was but a parish lass, ye ken, and them coomes o' strange beginnings.\" And Miss Charles felt Betty's words even stronger than that worthy individual herself. There never was so neat, so handy, so pleasant a little bird about the house as Bessie \u2014 and as for her powers of nursing, Miss Charles concluded she never slept \u2014 and as for her dainty little sick possets, Miss Charles felt it necessary, after every one, to linger on a little longer to taste it again : and and so she was beguiled into living until spring. In addition, she had so sweet, so touching a voice, Miss Charles could hear her read the Bible all day. And so at last this hard, stony-hearted woman died gently, like a child, holding fast on to the little soft hand of Bessie, and looking fondly into her weeping eyes \u2014 for Bessie could hate nothing, but loved all who would let her. \"Ay, a most Chrustianlike and Bible end,"], [317, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 311 as a body could wush ; and wad ye believe it, Mistress Wilson, no but an hour before her departer, she rises her heed, and says she, 'Niece, Betty's a good lass, let her hae ten good punds.'

But being a sharp woman, she at last steered clear between the two extremes \u2014 not but what she loved saving in all her heart ; it had been the one sole accomplishment incul cated in her since she was twelve years of age. But poor Bessie (we are bound, as faithful historians, to confess that her sur name was Trumps), poor Bessie Trumps had only found a home to lose it. Ori ginally she had prepared herself for being a nursery governess; but want of friends, funds, and recommendations had reduced her ambition to the lowest ebb of servi tude, rather than degradation or starving.

So, finally, she set up a school; and taking a French lady into partner ship \u2014 it is not to be told what a fa mous school that became.

Her eldest sisters were all undergoing most wonderful advantages abroad, and it was sad to think what comparisons might be drawn between the sisterhood on their return home.
