CHAPTER I IHH EDICT It was noon-hour of the twenty-seventh of May, in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine. ,. ai At noon hour of that day and year, small pieces of vellum were diseovereu posted on the corners of all the streets of Ralah; and on these pieces of vellum were written the following words : \u2014 , \" The faithful must not stir from their dwellings after dusk. Let every house be closed, every worshiper of Krishnu be lying on his mat. Let none open tneir doors or casements to look upon the gloom. 'Tis the order ef r The Temple. No. 1."], [10, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 2 As the people of Ralah read these notices \u2014 for such in fact they were \u2014 then hearts throbbed with religious emotion, and they bowed their heads reverentially as though inclining their brows to famed Krishnu's self. From the hour that the notices appeared, sileucc broke gradually over Ralah. The inhabitants hastened to complete their day's toil, and every individual com posing one of the four castes of the people did his work \u2014 whatever it might be \u2014 without uttering a useless word. Never before in Ralah had been seen such motion, industry, activity, and energy, with so little noise. For all understood the edict. AU? No; a sailor, as he passed through the streets, of late so noisy, marvelled at the extraordinary silence. \" Something is going on,\" he muttered, although he neither saw nor heard any thing to warrant his words ; \" something mysterious is going on \u2014 else why this unnatural silence over the city wide? Why these downcast eyes, these demure faces, this strange noiselessness ? Some plot's afoot, I'll swear to it!\" And the sailor walked on, chewing relentlessly upon the quid which he had just taken, and flinging his eyes suspiciously around and before him. As he proceeded, his eyes encountered half a dozen young men running towards a small sheet of vellum fastened upon the front of a house standing at a corner. While running to the spot, the faces of these young men were lit with hilarious thoughts, and their voices told of hilarious hearts. But as they read the ediet, their features became cold, sober, attentive, earnest. And when they had done perusing the vellum, they passed on, soberly, and noiselessly, as though some supernatural power had revolutionised their natures. \"Jupiter !\" exclaimed the sailor, twisting his quid from one side of his mouth to the other with extraordinary quickness, and ejecting a large quantity of saliva from his mouth. \" What the devil is the matter? What can that paper have to say?\" By this* ime he had reached the corner, and bis eye3 ran hastily over the edict. But, although, in consequence of his numerous voyages to Ralah, he could talk the native language, still he could not read the Bengalee words inscribed upon the vellum. \" What the devil can it be ?\" he cried, passionately, as he moved on. \" I never saw anything like it ! I've been here seven times, and I have made such profi ciency in Bengalee, that I can do everything with it but read it \u2014 I can't do that, d nit!\" And he was so angry now that he ejected his prized quid from his mouth, and replaced it by another, which he chewed upon intensely. \" If there's anything going on that requires help,\" he continued as he strode on, \" why don't they let's know it in English ? I'm sure I'd do all I could !\" The sailor, by the perfect acquaintance which he seemed to possess of the streets, had evidently considerable knowledge of the localities of Ralah. And he doubt less had a goal in view; for, as he journeyed on, he looked carefully at the right and left, as if to see whether or not he was pursuing the right course. Turning a corner, he stopped at the door of a low, one story building, on the shady side ef the street, and, examiningit attentively for a few moments, as if half dubious of its being the one of which he was in search, at last made up his mind tbat he had reached the right spot, and then entered."], [11, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 3 CHAPTER II. * KALAROO THB EARBER The hut \u2014 for it deserved no better name \u2014 which the sailor entered, was, as we have said, alow, one story building, square shaped, and divided by a sheet of dingy cotton, into two arartments, viz. the outer for the shop, and the inner for the eating and sleeping apartment. The furniture of the shop consisted of a bamboo chair, a rude bason and a long mat ; the latter spread upon the floor in the corner a few feet from the entrance. As the sailor entered, he beheld a young man of, apparently, not more than six and twenty, sitting disconsolately in the bamboo chair. Afclosed razor was in his right hand, which hung listlessly by his side ; his hairless head rested in the palm of his left, while his elbow rested on the arm of his chair. Stretched upon the mat, and buried in slumber, lay a young man of abont the same age as that of the one just described , in height and shape each resembled the other \u2014 but here all similarity ended ; for he who sat in the bamboo chair was copper-coloured, full in feature, and, save a sheet of dingy stoff which was wound around his loins, perfectly nude. The other was, doubtless, of another race and clime ; for his hair, thick, long and silky, was of the raven's hue ; his features, thin and sharp, perfectly classic ; his skin, though tanned, of a clear olive com plexion ; his limbs, slender, sinewy, beautifully proportioned. \"How are you Kalaroo?\" cried the sailor, in Bengalee, on entering the shop, \" how are you, Kalaroo ? What the devil's the matter that you put on such a lubberly phiz ? How are you, my boy ?\" And going up to the disconsolate youth sitting in the bamboo chair, he slapped him on the back so heartily that Kalaroo sprang up with a loud cry. \" Kalaroo is hurt !\" he exclaimed, piteously. \"jDon't say so, my hearty.!\" answered the sailor with a laugh. \" Wb\u00a3t> Kalaroo ! don't you know me ?\" \" 'Tis Dick Willis !\" cried the barber, forgetting his pain in his delight at meet ing and recognising his friend. \" To be sure it is, my hearty. Give us your grapplers !\" And seizing the long, slender fingers of the barber, he gave them a grip that made their owner shriek. The noise awoke the sleeper on the mat, who, \u2014 unnoticed either by the bar ber or sailor, \u2014 on discovering the stranger and Kalaroo, fixed a pair of small, black, beautifully-shaped eyes keenly upon them. \" Why, what the devil's the matter ?\" said the sailor, with a jovial laugh, as he saw a tear glistening in the barber's eye. The answer of Kalaroo was perfectly in keeping \u2014 \"Dick Willis squeezes so hard!\" \u25a0 \" Of course he does,\" said the sailor, laughing, and throwing himself into the chair. \" How has Kalaroo been since Dick Willis saw him last ?\" At this moment his eyes sell on the young man stretched on the mat, who was now apparently asleep. \"Hilloal who's that?\" he added, in a lower tone, and looking inquiringly at Kalaroo. The barber shrugged his shoulders, and shook his head. \" What does Kalaroo mean ?\" said the sailor, in a still lower tone. The barber placed his finger on his lower lip, glanced askantly at the sleeper shrugged his shoulders, and again shook his head. ** Umph ?\" said the sailor, in a whisper, and bending his head toward the bar ber, who was standing at his right. But Kalaroo was silent."], [12, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 4 f Dick Willis now turned his eyes full on the barber, and exclaimed, \" What ! is Kalaroo afraid to speak in his own house?\" The barber now glanced fearfully at the sleeper, and perceiving that he was still asleep, turned to the sailor and responded, whispenngly,\u2014 \" Kalaroo can say nothing here !\" The sailor looked at him in astonishment. \u2666 \" Kalaroo fears him V \" Ye-yes, Kalaroo is afraid\u2014 here!\" \" Is Kalaroo a coward?\" \" Kalaroo can fight bravely as any warrior !\" \" And yet afraid to speak?\" \" Ye-yes \u2014 here !\" .\u00ab\u25a0.,- This response awoke two feelings in the breast of the sailor,\u2014 viz., pity and curiosity. Stifling the latter feeling for the time being, he asked,\u2014 \" Where is Kalaroo's sister, the maid Thisbe ?\" At this question the head of the barber dropped, his eyes lowered, his hands fell supinely at his sides, and a deathly pallor shrouded his copper features. \"The devil is in this infernal city !\" muttered Dick Willis, as he beheld this change in his companion's countenance. \" If Kalaroo cannot tell me about his sister, will he tell me how and where his father is ?\" he added, fixing his eyes upon his friend. This simple question appeared to pain the barber even more than the preced ing ones for a low groan escaped his lips, and his whole frame became agitated. Still he spoke not. \" Does Kalaroo no longer love Dick Willis ?\" asked the sailor, in a tone min gled with indignation and suspicion. \"Kalaroo still loves Dick Willis, sor Dick Willis has been a brother to Kala roo,\" was the eager, tremulous reply. The sailor reflected a moment, and then said,\u2014 '* Kalaroo is poor ?\" '* Kalaroo is very poor,\" answered the barber, with downcast eyes. \"Dick Willis wishes Kalaroo to go with him to the jungle.\" \" Kalaroo will go with his friend to the jungle,\" was the reply/ \" On the instant ?\" \" On the instant.\" \" Then follow him.\" So saying, the sailor sprang from the bamboo chair, and walked out into the street, casting a furtive but indignant glance at the sleeper on the mat as he passed him. The sailor passed up the street, followed at a distance by the barber . Up the street \u2014 up, a long way up \u2014 they strode, till they found themselves on i wide track of waste, barren soil. Up the street^-up, a long way up, till they had left the city far behind them. ,J* Over the track \u2014 over the waste \u2014 over the sandy plain, they strode, till a sorest of canes \u2014 the tiger-laired jungle \u2014 rose before them- Through the brake \u2014 through the jungle \u2014 where the tiger and the-panthcr and the serpent hold their lairs, \u2014 through the brake, fearless as lascars , the sailor and the barber made their way, till they found themselves at the base of a bread Wee. Here they baited, and set them clown upon the mossy sward. For it was a day when the fire of the sun loomed upon the jungle in all its intensity : the air was like the atmosphere of a furnace. Not a breath stirred the tree leaves or the canes. The serpent lay listless in his nest in the earth the tiger lay distended and sluggish and panting in his dingv den ; the panther lay supine and parching in his slimy lair ; the parrot cawed lowly upon the motion less limb ; and.the pale owl slept silently in its hole in the tree. Not a wind-sigh nor a sound arose from the jungle. In thut hour of stillness and heat, it seemed as if shaft aster shaft of nerve-"], [13, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 5 crushing vapours had been flung upon the air to empoison and overpower the senses, and render listles sand supine the nerves. The wide-spreading limbs and long broad leaves of the bread tree, at the base of which sat the sailor and his friend the barber, completely sheltered them from the burning sun ; but that was all. Though in the shade, that fiery heat was around them. The sweat rolled from their heads, and brows, and cheeks,and breasts, and lower limbs in beads ; their hands grew every moment moister and more moist ; arid the sailor felt, as the moments flew, that the iron of his nerves was fast leaving him. So powerful and destructive was the heat, that the numerous and tiny insects of the trees and air felt themselves powerless, and dropped in thousands upon the sward. It was tenible, that hour of heat. That sailor had, in his vocation, travelled to almost every climo on earth ; he had seen the waters boil with the fire of the sun ; he had hunted in the jungle and on the plain, in the desert and in the ravine, with the red sun burning above him, and dissipating the thickest clouds by the power of its fire ; he had played with the crocodile in the Ganges in the hottest days of midsummer, when all else were lost in slumber or incapable of withstanding the hot, overpowering atmosphere. But never before had he felt so deeply the effects of the hot air and lurid sun. Still he could bear it ; his blue eye and light hair, his spare frame and sinewy limbs, attested it. He was of that favoured race that can abide Afrie's sun and Russia's blast, nor fear the reaction upon their systems caused by extrsmes. \" Kalaroo, can'st thou speak without being pained by the parching sun ?\" he said. \" If thou can'st so speak \u2014 do so ; if thou can'st not, shake thy head once only, and then lay thee down and sleep off the heat. I will watch over thee the while,\" \" Kalaroo can speak without thirst/or pain in spite of the heat, for Kalaroo is used the sun,\" was the reply, in a voice as calm and musical as ever proceeded from the lips of a being human. \" Then tell Dick Willis\u2014 for he is sad and curious \u2014 why Thisbe, the maiden who has been ever wont to welcome him on his arrival in Ralah, is not in her father's house to give him her lip and breast and the pressure of her soft hand to welcame and congratulate him ? Where is Thisbe ?\" And the sailor\u2014 his back against the tree, his hands clasped around his upraised knees \u2014 fixed his bold, blue eyes upon the downcast ones of the barber, Kalaroo. \" The sister of Kalaroo is in her father's house no longer,\" said the barber, in a voice tremulous with emotion. \" Where is Thisbe ?\" repeated the sailor, fiercely. \"Where the being hath placed her,\" replied the barber, fearfully. \" She is not dead V eried the sailor, starting, and bending his large blue eyes upon the barber. \" Thisbe is a spirit and spirits cannot die,\" was the trembling response. \" What means my brother Kalaroo ?\" At this moment, a. sound like the crashing of a cane was heard near them. The sailor started up, and ran his bold, blue eyes, searchingly, around ; but nothing met their gaze. Far or near, nothing was seen except the jungle canes and the towering fruit trees. The sailor resumed his position at the base of the tree. \" 'Tis some cane that bath cracked through the intensity of the heat,\" he mut tered. \" Did Kalaroo hear any noise ?\" he added, as he resumed his sitting pos ture. \" Kalaroo heard nothing,\" was the reply. \" Why did my brother start up, and why does he ask the question ?\" said the barber, in surprise. \"Did you not hear a noise 1\" said the sailor, in astonishment. \" Kalaroo heard nothing but the creaking of a limb as some parrot or owl shifted its position,\" said the earber,"], [14, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 6 \" No matter,\" returned the sailor, carelessly ; \"goon; tell me where the being, as Kalaroo calls him, hath placed Thisbe?\" \" Thisbe is not in her father's house,\" said the barber, ina piteous tone, as it desirous that his companion should cease importuning him upon the subject. \"Thisbe holds the heart of Dick Willis in her hand,\" said the sailor, divining. but determined to ferret out the last spark of the barber's knowledge; \" and Dick Willis must live without a heart till he finds her. Where is Thisbe ?\" Again a slight creak, like that produced by the moving together of two upright canes, was again heard. \" Did Kalaroo not hear that ?\" cried the sailor, starting. \" Kalaroo heard nothing,\" was the strange reply. And yet the baiber lied not \u2014 nor was the noise an imaginary one. \" No matter,\" said the sailor, carelessly. \" Tell me, where is Thisbe ?\" \" In the temple,\" replied the barber, shuddering. The face of the sailor became pale. \" Ha ! in the temple?\" What doth she there ?\" \" Thisbe is a vestal \u2014 the priests need a virgin,\" was the mysterious reply. The lips of the sailor became livid. \" Her duty in the temple ?\" he demanded, hoarsely. Kalaroo was silent \u2014 his lips trembled \u2014 his features were convulsed\u2014 his frame shook ; and yet bis eyes were cast down \u2014 his lips mute. \" Must Dick Willis speak twice?\" asked the sailor, mournfully. The barber's eyes now swam in tears. Conflicting emotions were shaking his frame terribly. \"Speak! my brother!\" cried the sailor in a mournful whisper; \"else Dick Willis will die!\" \" The priests fear Ihe coming of Ravanah, \u2014 an undefiled virgin alone can read the golden tablets \u2014 the being hath placed Thisbe in the temple \u2014 Thisbe is a vir gin I\" muttered Kalaroo, in a voice broken with sobs. Yea, sobs; for the barber's love for the sailor had triumphed over his religious vow not to reveal to an infidel the secrets of his creed. Kalaroo's frame trembled, and his bones rattled, and his eyes rolled, and his lips twitched, and his teeth chattered, and his nostrils dilated with fear \u00bbf his hereafter ; already he felt the tortures of the damned eating up his soul; already he felt the slimy serpents winding around his limbs, and spitting their poison into his ears and mouth and eyes and nostrils ; ha felt the stings in his flesh, and hearts their hisses in his ears; he felt the clammy fingers of the fiend plucking the flesh from his limbs, and the sharp fire licking the marrow of his bones ; he felt the brand of \" traitor\" burning on his brow, and the flames eating into without consuming the brain. The fear-sweat rolled in large beads from his brow and cheeks and arms and breast \u2014 every pore sent forth its quota of cold sweat. The sailor, himself pale with rage and disappointment, looked on his companion with pity; for he was aware of the threats held out by the priests to keep the se crets of the temple from the knowledge of infidels. \" But the father of my brother V he said, desirous of breaking the agony of the barber and of gratifying bis own curiosity, \" The spirit of Kalaroo's father is in Paradise,\" said the barber, in a tremulous whisper. '< When Dick Willis was last in Ralah, the father of Kalaroo was strong and vi gorous. How came he to die? Dick Willis is sad at his absence.\" \" 'Twas the being's work,\" said the barber, trembling. '' Who is the being?\" \"The being that Dick W.ius saw sleeping on the mat, in Kalaroo's shop.\" \"Who is the being ?\" repeated the sailor, pitilessly. It was strange, the power of that American sailor, over the mind of that poor, benighted barber. \" Kalaroo fears the being, yet knows not what he is. Kalaroo stabbed him onee,"], [15, "THR ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 7 but the being only laughed ; for though the creese went into the flesh, no signs of blood followed it. The being cannot be killed, for he is a mystery. \" Why did Kalaroo stab him ?\" \" The being came to Kalaroo's shop, with a mat in his left hand, and a knife in his right. He threw down the mat, stretched himself upon it, and went to sleep ; \u2014 Kalaroo was shaving a customer, and grew angry at the conduct of the stranger, and, running upon him with his long, thin creese, stabbed him. The stranger opened his eyes, pointed to the bloodless wound, laughed, then re-closed his eyes in sleep. Kalaroo then trembled, and became afraid.\" \" Well ?\" said the sailor, who was now all interest. \" The being remained in the shop,'' continued Kalaroo, \"made it his abode, and when, at meal time, we sat down to our rice, he came and joined us without being invited. We could not abide him, and yet we feared him. One day Kalaroo, accompanied by his father, went out to seek customers. When he returned, the being was there, but Thisbe was gone. ' Where is Thisbe ?' said Kalaroo. ' Of the world no more ; she ia a vestal of the temple,' said the. being, scornfully. Ka laroo could not speak, his heart was in his throat. The father of Kalaroo then re turned. ' Where is Thisbe ?' he said. ' I have carried her to. the temple ; she is a vestal there,' said the being. The father of Kalaroo was angry now ; his great heart swelled with a mighty trouble ; for he had sold Thisbe to his sailor-friend, Dick Willis, and was rearing her, and feeding her, and training her for a beautiful bride. She was gone ; what would Dick Willis say when he returned, and found that the wife he had paid for was gone, and not ready to receive him ? He would say that the father of Kalaroo was an ungrateful villain and a cheat ! He rushed upon the being to strangle him, \u2014 but his hands fell on iron. The being laughed mockingly. ' 'Tis the fiend !' shrieked the father of Kalaroo ; and the old man fell gasping to the earth. Kalaroo sprang forward, and stooped to lift his sire up ; but his hands encountered naught but an old man's clay\u2014 the father of Kalaroo was dead !\" Again was heard a noise like the bending and commingling of canes. And ajain sprang the sailor from his mossy seat at the base of the towering tree. But again as before, his searching eyes encountered nothing human. \" This being ?\" he added, interrogatingly, as he resumed his posture. \" The being will not leave the shop of Kalaroo,\" continued the barber, tremu lously ; \"hekeepshis mat 'in the shop \u2014 sleeps upon it, as before \u2014 and at meal times, uninvitedly joins me at my rice and fruit. Kalaroo never speaks to him: sor Kalaroo fears him \u2014 he is a bane, a woe, and a mystery. To know him is to fear him \u2014 to look upon him to tremble !\" The sailor leaned his brow in the palm of his left hand thoughtfully. What he had just heard, troubled him. An involuntary shudder crept over him as here called the image of the being ; each feature so manly, so bold, so relentless, so magnificent, so perfect ! His skin \u2014 so smooth, alabaster-like, though swarthed by an Indian sun! His limbs \u2014 though slender, so finefy, nay, brilliantly propor tioned ; so sinewy, so flexible, so solid ! And his mind \u2014 as displayed in his ac tions \u2014 how cool, how ke^p, how wary, how relentless, how bold ! A paragon of villains, if base ! And yet And the brow of the sailor darkened. And yet \u2014 as he reflected upon the being \u2014 strange flashes of strange unaccount able, shapeless things crept in from the sides of the sailor's brain and disturbed the clearness of his. thought ; and each flash was accompanied by a gloomy iloud, which, as it entered, shrouded the flash, and left the brain-chamber in darkness. \" Mysterious being !\" muttered the sailor, in a low, clear whisper. And yet all unconscious was he that his lips had betrayed the musings of his soul. And all unconscious was be that the eyes of his companion were gazing at him nervously ; for it was no trifling anguish to that poor benighted Indian that the"], [16, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 8 acts of the fearful being had brought a gloomy brow upon his friend. For his own woes he little recked, when he thought upon the sorrow and disappointment of Dick Willis. The spell of the being was cast, too, upon his friend, for lo ! how earnestjwas his brow, how pale his cheeks, how dreamy his eyes ! Four years ago, the sailor had bought Thisbe\u2014 then a maiden of twelve only \u2014 of her sire for five rupees ; the girl to be delivered to him when she attained the flower of her loveliness. And now \u2014 where now was Dick Willis 's Indian bride ? The being had abducted and borne and yielded her into the hands of the high priest of the temple ! And the heart of the poor, true-hearted Kalaroo throbbed painfully as he thought of these suets ; for \u2014 far as man can love man \u2014 the Indian loved the sailor, and would have died at any moment to serve or make him happy. Suddenly the sailor nised his eyes. \" Dick Willis saw seme small bills on the corners of the streets\u2014 when gay, young men looked upon them, their faces sobered, and the laugh fled their lips \u2014 their import?\" he demanded, quickly. \"The tablets of the temple are to be read to-night \u2014 the tablets of the mystic chamber,\" said Kalaroo, with downcast eyes ; \" and all are warned not to stir or enter the streets.\" \"Wherefore ?\" \" The priests look for the coming of the great Ravanah.\" ''Why cometh Ravanah?\" \"To deliver his people from the bondage of the stranger.\" \" The Mussulman horde.\" \" Yes, my brother.\" This is the legend of the sous and daughters of Ralah. \" But she tablets\u2014 Thisbe \" '' Thisbe is a virgin \u2014 none but a virgin undefiled can read the tablets of destiny.'' Such is the Indian legend. The sailor's brow darkened. \" The being, then, is an instrument of the priests \u2014 the riddle is solved,\" he muttered. Again was heard the mysterious cracking of canes. \"Did Kalaroo hear that?\" cried the sailor, starting up. A lend, painful, thrilling agonising shriek was the quick, but startling reply. '3 As the sailor turned, a low, chuckling laugh fell on his appalled ears. \" 'Tis the laugh of the being!\" he articulated, faintly; for he felt his blood crawling like a slimy serpent through his veins. \" But, God of heaven ! what is this ?\" he exclaimed, as his eye fell upon his sriend. Kalaroo was writhing in the most exquisite misery ; not a sound above a low, heart-cutting moan\u2014 more terrible than the frightfullest of shrieks \u2014 escaped him, so intense was his agony. The sailor was fear-palled, dumb, motionless ; had a mine yawned before [him, he could not have stirred a muscle, nor a nerve, nor a limb. Still writhed the wretched Kalaroo ; and now, as he rolled round and round in that awful torture, the point of a sharp, stained reed peered from his spine. The eyes of the sailor now gleamed with fear and wrath ; for lo ! treachery was afoot, and poison abroad ! Hark to that low thick gurgle ! and now \u2014 Kalaroo's spirit is flying upward ! Like one pursued byjloosened spirits, the sailor now started and dashed through the jungle."], [17, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 9 CHAPTER III THE TABLETS. It was a night of woe in Ralah. The sun had gone down to his bed in the west' suddenly, like a king hastily driven from his dazzling throne. As he departed, a pale shroud mantled the sky, hiding in its ghastly folds, the azure and stars, HE RUSHED UPON THE BEING TO STRANGLE HIM, BUT HIS HAND FELL ON IRON, 'TIS THE FIEND, SHRIEKED HE.JTHE OLD MAN FELL GASPING TO THE EARTH. Anon, a murky, smoky legion ef clouds crept lazily from the south, increasing in blackness and thickness till the entire heavensjwere wrapped in a panoply ot sables. No. 2,"], [18, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 10 The city of Ralah was enveloped in darkness and steeped in gloom. From fha sullen earth to the cloud-swathed sky, was one eternal vapour of blackness and liotness and closeness and leadenness. The waters of the Ganges were waveless, noiseless\u2014 still. From the north to the south, from the east to the west, the funereal clouds crawled lazily, till space and earth and sea were buried in one impenetrable gloom. And yet on this night of parching thirst, and nerve-crushing and blood-boiling heat, the children of Ralah lay stretched on their mats, groaning with anguish and shrieking with thirst ; but \u2014 faithful to the order of the ministers of their creed \u2014 not one opened his cssement or murmured at the edict. The watchmen of the night \u2014 unable to battle with the nerve-crushing heat- sunk heavily at their posts, muttering prayers. Ominous was the edict \u2014 \" Look not forth upon the gloom !'' The thickness of the darkness and the power of the heat announced calamity ! Of Ralah's thousands, one mam alone disturbed the silence of the deserted streets. And he \u2014 with step as collected, and eye as unerring as though it were in the broad glare of day \u2014 pierced through the darkness and made his way calmly down to the banks of the river. Even through the darkness, the glitter of his small black eye3 shone like diamonds in a cavern. To him, what were the parching heat or the black shroud, hiding sea, earth and sky? He flung him down on the brink of the shore, and, his head resting in the palm of his upturned hand, ran his black searching eyes into the depths of the silent waters. Calmly he looked down, that strange mysterious youth,; and as he saw the crocodile slumbering in its muddy nest, a fearful smile stole over his lips and\\a strange light gleamed in the pupils of his small, jet-black eyes, and the circles that girdled them radiated with the brilliancy of the serpent's orb, when fascinating its prey. Calmly he lay there, sor an hour or more, that strange, mysterious youth ; pro- bing with his small, dark eyes, the bosom of that river's bed \u2014 his lips voiceless \u2014 his eyes alone denoting the secret musings of his brain. For an hour or more he lay there, and then rose, and folding his arms, turned his eyes towards the west, where, calm and waveless as the waters before him, lay the broad, shoreless sea. And a yearning sigh escaped him. \"Oh, for a bark to bear me far away from this tiresome Ralah!\" And then he turned, and with a calm, echoless tread, walked on till he came to the temple : a huge, sombre pile, shaped like a parenthesis, that rose in the centie of a broad square. The three massive doors fronting the pile were locked and barred from within ; aud two armed slaves, each holding a long curved sword in his right hand stood sentry at each portal. And yet so dark was the night and so light, stealthy, and serpent-like the tread of the strange youth, that, all unnoticed by the sentinels, he advanced to a jutting pillar, midway in the facade, and pressing a false knot carved on the stone, sud- denly found himself at the base of a narrow spiral staircase,|leading to the dome of the temple. All was darkness in that pillar ; but the eyes of the youth seemed equally to penetrate the darkness as the light. With the same calm, noiseless steps that had enabled him to pass unheard by the dusky sentinels, he ascended the staircase. So hushed were his breathings, so calm and steady his footfalls, a watcher would have taken him for the noiseless hut implacable, relentless Death that is efernallv wandering, now here, now there, all around the world, and leaving in his track, silent, lifele 3 imiges ot the great God of time. Up, up he went \u2014 up, up that spiral staircase, till, on Hearing the top, he found himself in a small, lightless gallery overlooking the vast pillars and statues and altars and blue watch-fires of the interior of the temple. The light 1 11 below, and the small gallery above all dark, the youth crept noiselessly towards tlie balconied guard and looked down. Encircling a low, square altar, beside which stood the high-priest, his left hand"], [19, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 11 resting on a black, gold-bound volume, were twelve copper-coloured priests, their heads, close-shaved, bowed down, and their snowy gowns, tight a the neck, cover ing them to the heel, and their arms crossed meekly on their breasts. Behind the altar, rose a semi-circular range of high, white pillars, on which were carved, with all the detail and nicety of art, images of fce great Krishnu and his angels; while high on a pedestal, midway between the pillars and the altar, rose a pale statue of the immortal Ravanah. Standing on low pedestals, stretching from side to side of the vast temple, were twelve urn-shaped burners, emitting a glowing, pale-blue flame. A huge torch, affixed to the pedestal of the Ravanah statue, flung a broad glare around, and was the only light that dissipated the darkness. As the eyes of the youth had just taken note of this scene, the sound of an invi sible gong rang through the temple. \" It is the hour !\" exclaimed the high priest, in a deep voice. \" Bring forth the maiden !\" Six of the twelve priests now turned, and forming into two lines, proceeded, with measured step and solemn, towards a small, iron-bound door on the left of the altar. ~S As they reached the spot, the door swung back, and the priests passed in, when the door was noiselessly re-closed. At this moment a low roar was heard from the statues. The high. priest started, but uttered not a word. By the workings of hi* hoary countenance, was revealed his agitation. Again silently swung back the small, iron-bound door ; and three priests came slowly forth. Behind them, came one whose aspect sent a sudden thrill through the veins and heart of the mysterious youth in the gallery. It was a maiden, nude from crown to heel, save a small snowy garment that girdled her loins. Her modest brow, and large black eyes, fringed with long silky lashes, \u2014 her aquiline nose and voluptuous lips, \u2014 her bold, beautifully-rounded chin \u2014 her long, thick, silky hair, reaching to her girdle \u2014 the beautiful contour of her voluptuous shoulders, breast and lower lisabs, reflected as they were by the light of the gleaming torch, awoke in the breast of the youth a strange, indescribable feeling. His breath grew hot, his eyes lustrous, and his bosom painful. Sensations to which he had previously been a stranger now crept over every part of him. Strange thoughts rose in his mind, and it seemed as if the sight of that vestal had melted the cavern-doors of his brain. A new consciousness flitted, like a sudden spark in a dark night, through his soul. And still his eyes were upon that virgin as she walked in the midst of that file of priests. Slowly they passed to the altar, till the vestal \u2014 her head bent, her eyes downcast \u2014 stood opposite the high-priest. Again a low roar burst from the statues. \"Virgin of Krishnu !\" said the high-priest, solemnly, \"we have summoned thee in Ravanah's name to ope the sealed tablets. Hast thou courage ?\" \" I have no fear,\" was the response, in a low, clear voice that was heard in every part of the temple. \" Art thou a virgin ?\" The maiden was silent ; but a burning flush swept over her. \"Answer, in the name of Ravanah!\" \" I am,\" said the vesta), faintly. And her lips quivered, and her bosom swelled. \" Then, maideD, approach this eacred altar, and lay thy right hand upon this book,\" said the priest, in a voice sepulchral. The vestal, with a struggle, obeyed. And as her han drested on that gold bound volume, her eyes were moist and downcast. And at that moment, the low roar oi\" the statues again rang through the temple. At this moment, at a movement from the high-priest, his twelve companions turned their faces from the altar and fell upon their knees. \"Maiden,\" said the high-priest, in an agitated tone, \"the ministers of Krishnu"], [20, "THE ADVENTURES OP A VAGABOND. 12 hold their last watch-fire for the coming of the great Ravanah. We are a race of slaves\u2014 our people are trodden\u2014 our faith derided. For centuries the infidel have ruled and trampled upon us, and mocked us in our sufferings. To restore us to our former liberties and to punish our barbarous masters, Krishnu has promised to send his son, the Prince of Heaven, the great Ravanah. Strange signs have been seen in the sky, strange birds have been seen in the air, a mystery is in the at mosphere, and even the statues in the temple have twice roared to-night. All these warn us of some great event coming. Maiden, tell us\u2014 fortel these signs the near approach of Ravanah ?\" The vestal was silent. The strange youth in the gallery, sheltered by the darkness, looked down ea gerly. Again the roar was heard from the statues. \"Ope the tablets, maiden !\" eried the high-priest, deeply agitated. The vestal, with averted head, opened the dark, gold-bound volume. \" Nay,\" exclaimed the agitated priest, watching her, \" turn thine eyes upon the tablets, and tell us what thon seest, or the gods will strike thee dead !* Thus adjured, the vestal turned her head slowly till it rested upon a page of So1*- . . \"Now, what see'st thou ?\" cried the agitated priest, averting his head, unable to look upon that gleaming page. And now the entire being of the vestal appeared to be changed. As she gazed upon the golden tablet, her nervousness gave way to a feeling of marble. Her black, piercing eyes were fixed upon the glittering sheet ; and her brow grew moody, thoughtful, cloudy. \" What see'st thou, maiden ? Answer !\" And the adjuration from the high-priest was followed by a low, harsh moan from the statues. Ere the echo had died away the answer of the maiden \u2014 in a voice measured in its tone, and solemn \u2014 was given in these words : \u2014 \"Lo! I see a desert, wild, barren, sandy ; the sun belches its fire upon its broad, sterile bosom \u2014 no living thing can travel there, no living thing live there.'' \"Well?\" \" Afar in the east of this desert appear two small dots.\" \" Go on \u2014 go on, maiden !\" \" As they approach, they increase in size, and now they take shape.\" Again belched forth the roar of the statues. \"Oh, maiden!\" cried the agitated priest, trembling from crown to heel; \"on maiden, on ! nor pause, for lo ! the gods grow angry at our tardiness. On \u2014 on \u2014 nor pause !\" The voice of the vestal again pealed clearly, thrillingly upon the ears of the kneeling, trembling priests. \" The dots are now so near, their features and garments can be distinguished ; they are a hoary pilgrim and a beautiful youth. They make me shudder !\" At this moment a feeling of delight commingled with fear darted through the nerves of the youth in the gallery : the coming of that old pilgrim and the beau tiful youth made him at once joyous and fearful. \"Shudder not!\" cried the high-priest, in a voice bordering on frenzy; \"tremble not, maiden ; the priests of Krishnu will protect thee. On \u2014 on \u2014 nor tremble, nor pause !\" \" The pilgrim is very aged,\" continued the vestal, shuddering ; \" his long, white beard reaches to his waist ; his large black [eyes are fixed yearningly yet malig nantly before him ; his aquiline nose, and strait brows, and high scored sorehead give him a wild, vindictive look ; and yet his blanched cheeks, and skeleton limbs and regular step, tell of long travel, a fixed purpose, a blasted life, and a mighty mind. He is a terrible being \u2014 he makes me tremble !\" \" Tremble not, maiden ! the gods are around thee \u2014 their priests encourage thee Tell us all thou see'st.\" \" The youth \u2022\""], [21, "- THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 13 \" Tell us of the youth,\" cried the high-priest, eagerly. \" He is youDg, beside that aged pilgrim ; his hair is black, his eyes small and dark, his features, in contour, resembling those of the pilgrim ; his skin is un marked by time, and yet he looks like one who has been youthful for long centu ries. More than the pilgrim that youth makes me tremble !\" \" I say unto thee, tremble not 1\" exclaimed the trembling priest , \"thou art a vestal in the keeping of the gods ! On \u2014 on \u2014 halt not ; for lo, the hour wanes.\" \" The pilgrim and the youth now sit them down in the desert,\" pursued the vestal: \" and now the sun sinks, and clouds sweep over the^ face of the desert. I see them no longer !\" The vestal paused. The breath of the strange youth above now grew thick and hot. \" Thou haltest !'' exclaimed the high-priest, in a tone of reproach, j \"A cloud is over the plate,\" answered the vestal, apologetically. \" Turn to the next tablet,\" said the priest. The maiden tremblingly obeyed. \" Now, what see'st thou ?\" demanded the priest, eagerly. The vestal scanned the plate earnestly for a few moments, and then answered, \" The gates of a large, prosperous city.\" \"Well?\" \"jTwo strangers are at the gates crying for admission.\"/ At this moment the strange youth heard a low, faint cry, like that of one running from a distant pursuer, in his brain, and felt at the same moment a heavy hand grasping his arm. A vague feeling sat sor an instant on his heart, and he turned hastily but noiselessly around ; but though his eyes could penetrate through the gloom of the darkest night bs well as the light of the clearest noon-day, he encountered nothing. \" 'Twas one of my strange fancies,\" he muttered, mentally. And he resumed his attitude of watcher and listener of the rites below. \" And the strangers ?\" demanded the'priest, eagerly. \" Are the aged pilgrim and the mysterious youth.\" At this moment, a light flashed through the brain of the youth in the gallery ; but it was like a sudden, streak of heat on a cold, open road \u2014 for an instant only ; and theu'all was dark, blank, Lethe-like. The blood of the vouth now became cold and chilly. Still he felt no anxiety to leave the gallery ; sot there was fascination in the words of the young vestal \u2014 if not in the virgin herself \u2014 that chained him where he stood. '\u2022 Are they admitted ?\" asked the priest, agitatedly. \" The pilgrim gives gold to the guard, and the gates are swung open, and the pair enter the city,\" was the reply. As these words fell on the ears of the kneeling priests, they uttered a loud cry of terror. At the same moment, as if to increase then fears, an agonizing wail burst from the statues. The kneeling priests then fell forward, on their faces, some in convulsions, other speechless : but all terrified. \" Go on !\" cried the high priest, shuddering ; '' 'tis some devil and not Ravanah, thou see'st. Go on, maiden. Our watch-fires aie burning, and till the great Krishnu extinguishes, 'twere impious in his ministers to quit his temple. Go on, maiden go on ! My brothers !\" he.continued, mournfully, as his eyes fell on the prostrate priests, and beheld them supine or writhing, \" forget your fears in your piety : Ravanah is looking down upon you, and will witness that ye keep not faith ful watch. My brothers, do, you hear 1\" he addedjimploringly. \" They hear not,\" he continued, and a flush of agony swept o /er his hoary features, \u2014 \" on, maiden, on! The high-priest alone shall keep faithful watch. On, maiden \u2014 on!\" \" The tablet is dimming.'and a sickly shade is sweeping over the city,\" said the vestal, shuddering."], [22, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 14 \" To the neit tablet, then !\" cried the hoary priest, quickly. \" Now, what see'st thou ?\" \"A city of woe !\" answered the vestal, hoarsely. \" Ha !'' cried the priest, staggering to and leaning against a pillar ; \" read on!\" \"I see carcases of men, women and children lying in the streets, in the houses, floating on the rivers, and living men running by, as if fearing to touch them.\" \"Goon!\" \"I see old and young, male and female, tottering, shivering, falling, grasping, and as each is seized by this weakness, all shudder, run, and fly.\" \"Proceed!\" \" I sae streams of dead \u2014 one after the other \u2014 hastening to funeral piles. The fires are lighted and clouds of smoke, smoke, smoke are belching round and round, and darting upward and mingling with the clouds.\" \" Go on \u2014 go on !\" \" The lurid sun beams down upon the pinejand bamboo huts, and houses of wood crack from the fierceness of its fire. On the banks of the river are scores of men women and children ; some walking, some kneeling, some tearing their hair, but all in fear, agony, terror. Some plunge wildly into the river, where the crocodiles hungry and panting, are swimming about in search of food and prey. \u2014 There are splashes in the water, and hurried movements on the shore ; some run to the river and look in, whilst others are fleeing wildly away : the splashes are caused by he crocodiles devouring the wretches who have plunged into the tide.\" \" Go on,\" repeated the priest, faintly. At this moment a change came over the plate. \"The tablet is now representing a hasty series of days and nights,\" said the vestal, \"and still each day represents the same scene ; woe, anguish, death, and the dead.\" \"Go on, maiden !\" said the priest, in a hoarse whisper. \" What see'st thou now ?\" ' \" The city again, and again woe, death, and the dead ; but a natural glow has taken place of the fiery red in the sun.\" \"Ha !\" exclaimed the priest, in a voice of hope. \"The air is pure and the sun natural, but a dark cloud still hangs over the city,\" pursued the vestal ; \" the city seems almost, deserted ; the few visible are lean, gaunt, and feeble, tottering as they walk. But the shores are lined with people. They look thin and wan.\" \" Thou speak'st of famine, maiden\u2014 while the destroyer reigned, trade aud agriculture halted in affright. But go on.\" \" Mothers are there with their babes in their arms\u2014 and they look wistfully at the crocodiles swimming in the river. And now -\" \" Why falterest thou ?\" \"A terrible sight is here, and it makes me tremble!\" \"What is't?\" \"Lean and starved mothers with their bones starting through the akin ; their eyes are sunk and ghastly ; their cheeks caved and lined. They bear their lank, squalid babes on their hearts, and, standing on the brink of the shore, stare wildly at the crocodiles. And now \u2022' \" Well ?\" \"Mothers to end the torture of their little babes, fling them wildly into the river to feed the maw of the open-jawed crocodile.\" \" Go on,\" said the priest, hoarsely. \"A dimness now shadows all the tablet,\" said the vestal. now?''\u2122' ' l\u00b0 thenCXt a\"d kSt'\" added the Priest' \"What <*<** thou \" Five words,\" was the simple answer. ''Read them aloud,\" gasped the high-priest, with a convulsive shudder. * ith a strong effort the vestal read, in a clear voice, the following words :-"], [23, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 15 \" Sfach the doom of Ralah !\" At this moment a Toatrlike a thuuder peal came from the statues \u2014 the watch fires sunk in ashes, and the temple was in darkness. The high-priest, unable longer to battle with his fears, fell back, with a faint moan. The vestal became paralyzed, senseless, but retained her position at the altar. Suddenly a haad was round her waist \u2014 hot lips were pressed so hers, and, the next instant, by some mysterious arm, she was borne without the temple. CHAPTER IV. THE OATH. The succeeding morning broke without a sun. From horizon to horizon a grey light only was perceptible. No blue was in the sky \u2014 no sun in the heavens \u2014 no breath in tho air. The waters of the Ganges were waveless, murky, and, apparently, lifeless. At dawn, the inhabitants crawled from their mats, opened their doors and case ments, and looked forth ; and then their hearts sank within them. The atmos phere was grey, and, like that of the preceding day, heavy, cheerless, woe-telling. There walrnot a heart in Ralah but shook as its owner looked out upon the air and up at the dull, grey sky. The long-expected comiDg of Ravanah was looked for ; but the dreadful heat and, darkness'of the preceding night, and the gloomy, airless space of the present day were not the signs they had been taught to look for at his coming. Rather so the children of Ralah reasoned \u2014 foretell these signs some terrible calamity or the approach of an unchained fiend. And their hearts 6ank and their souls were sad \u2014 the poor ones of Ralah. To the day's task they went cheerlessly ; and the varied work that sustains a state was done poorly, mournfully, the live-long day. All wished for night, so woeful were their hearts, so fearful their bosoms. No man spoke to his neighbour \u2014 no father to his son\u2014 no brother to his sister ; it was work, work, work\u2014 silence, silence, silenoe. And still all played the laggard. Night came at last, and with it the darkness and the airlessness, and the hotness of the eve preceding. And men crouched fearfully on their mats, in wild, blank despair. A single movement was torture ; for with it rushed forth large beads of sweat, and through the frame slibrp, agonising pains. Some in desperation, crawled out into the streets, and se down to the edge of the rb/er, in hepe of catching there a trifling breath of air, to allay the fever of their blood. But in vain \u2014 not worse in their homes the sweat-drawing air than that around the waters. And then they shrieked and cursed, and prayed and cursed again ; but neither cry nor curse nor prayer availed them in that night of heat and darkness ; and so thej plunged them into the tide, though conscious that the shark and crocodile were prowling there in hope and search of prey. And then rose shrieks and cries of agony, that for a moment thrilled and cooled the blood of those suffering on shore ; but for a moment only ; and witb V, i fire \u2014 their eyes starting, \u2014 sockets cracking \u2014 fresh plunges ! Hark ! (fresh victims \u2014 fresh cries \u2014 fresh shrieks ! The shark and crocodile are feasting on live and human agony, and reddening the dull, murky stream with human blood !"], [24, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 16 Affrighted were all the hearts on the banks of that deathly river; fear-palled yet desperate, as men can be who, feeling hot sweat rolling from every pore, and scorching and stifling, and strangling them, yet plunge into a tide where certain death is. t Some turned and fled to their homes, others sank powerless on the river s brink, while others plunged them in, preferring certain death to the torture they were suffering. On the after-deck of the merchantman, New-York, leaning over the taffrail, his eyes striving to penetrate the darkness and look upon those parts of the river from whence arose the cries of human agony as the shark or crocodile ma wed som^ poor wretch swimming in its path, and his eager ear listening sor fresh shrieks, was one already seen by the reader. His jacket and hat were laid aside, and in his trousers and shirt alone, Dick Willis, the first mate, leaned over the taffrail, the sweat rushing from his every pore in enormous beads. All on board, save him, lay, some in their hammocks, some on deck \u2014 in restless, dreamy slumber. The heat was too overpowering far their senses, and they !ay, and tossed, and cursed, till slumber or torgetfulness enchained them. But the mate neither sought his hammock, nor cared for the darkness or the heat. Thought was at work, and busily ; and though the sweat poured from his every limb in huge drops he heeded it not. There was that within which made his physical members mere things of convenience. The body-torture revelling among his companions and the wretched children of Ralah was by him uufelt, unnoticed. The mightiest part of him \u2014 his mental being \u2014 was in labour ; and soothe lesser part he recked not. Not a word spoke he ; but there was a liveliness on his lip j and a hallowness in his cheek, and a sunkness and lustre in his eye, and a deep shade around his mouth that told of deep and dire thoughts. The plashes and shrieks and cries and groans in the river seemed to please and harmonise with his aroused and working soul. At every cry and shriek and groan, he turned his eye towards the spot whence the sound arose, and an exulting smile distorted his already compressed and livid lips. As the hours flew, and the agonising sounds ceased, \u2014 when the prevailing silence warned him that no human ear was near\u2014 when the darkness and hotness had increased, and|his ship companions were, beyond aperadventure fast chained in sleep, then, and not till then, came a single sound from his compressed lips. And even when he spoke, the words rushed through his small, closed teeth, like the hissing of a serpent. In that hour of darkness \u2014 without witness other than the Eternal, that sailor of a rankled heart raised himself erect up on the taffrail, and folding his arms and turning his head toward the city, exclaimed, \u2014 \" If in the broad glare of day, or in the twilight or in the darkness I meet him \u2014 may the great God strike me to ashes, if I slay him not !\" But as the words escaped his lips, a laugh\u2014 low, clear, fiend-like\u2014 fell on his ear that made his blood creep. It was so unlike the laugh of a human being that it shook the sailor's heart and made it shiver like a reed. The sweat that had started from his pores became thrillingly cold, and hung on his flesh like so many little spots of ice. He staggered\u2014 one moment he was either in the shark -haunted Ganges, or on the deck! He reeled\u2014 his right foot, by some strange chance, beinff the first to rise \u2014 and fell sideways, on the deck. So heavy was his fall that the sound started the captain from his hammock, as if a thunderbolt had fallen on his ship. Seizing a lantern and rushing up on deck, he discovered the mate lying near the wheel\u2014 blood oozing from his mouth and nose and ears\u2014 his body stretched and quivering, as though stricken with an ague fit. Summoning aid, the captain had him conveyed below and laid upon the table \u2022 where, when the bleeding was stopped and the disfigured face cleansed all started back on discovering the ghastly corpse-like hue of the features\u2014 the eyes were onen but the pupils turned up and nearly hidden, and the white balls\u2014 all veinv and lustrous\u2014 gleaaing like those of a fiend. \" '"], [25, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 17 CHAPTER V. THE SCRIBE OF THE TEMPLE, The chamber of the scribe was elliptical in shape, and the ceiling Its only entrance wa? through a small door \u2014 shaped like the chamber\u2014 at the south end ofthe apartment ; and the only light was that received through a window in the vaulted ceiling. The two sides of the chamber wove lined With shelves run nine from floor to roof, and these were tilled with large, thick volumes, similar m hale s\u2122e, and appearance to the ledgers sometimes seen in the counting-house, of our' old-fashions merchants.

No. S."], [26, "THE ADVENTURES OF A|VAGABOND. 18 In the centre of this chamber,' and directly under the horizontal light, stood a low, broad table with bamboo legs and covered with a smooth shtet of melted caoutchouc, or rubber, hardened by some chemical process to the unyieldingness of marble. Upon this table lay a huge, ledger-like book, of the thickest and finest of vellum, a pen made from the feather of an eagle, and a bowl filled nearly to the brim with ink. Before this table, sitting on a bamboo chair, his elbow resting on the open book, his head bent and supported by his upraised hands, was a copper-coloured man, whose age\u2014 judging from the snowy brows of his large, clear, black eyes, and the straight lines upon his forehead \u2014 could not have been far from seventy years. The oval door opened, and Ramur, the high-priest, entered the chamber. His brow was gloomy, thoughtful, and his step slow. Advancing towards the table,|he gazed sor a few moments silently on the aged scribe, who appeared to be buried in the perusal of the page before him. \" Ho, Kamul!\" said the high-priest in a loud voice. Kamul, the scribe, slowly raised his eyes and turned his head. On perceiving his superior, he lose and drawing a chair, presented it to him saying, \u2014 *' Ramur's pleasure with his slave ?\" \"Ramur would hear Kamul read the journal of the temple for the last three days,\" said the priest calmly. The scribe paused for a moment before his superior, and, dropping his eyes thrice in token of his inferiority, then turned to the book he had beenjpeiusing, and which the entrance of the priest had interrupted. Ina voice deep as the grave he read these words : \u2014 \" 27th May. \u2014 The watch fires were lighted atjdawn, under the surveillance of Ramur the high-prieat ; the heat of the day being intense, the fires burned dimly. At dusk a murky darkness shrouded the sky, and all without the temple was steeped in the blackest of darkness ; no air gave breath, or fanned the cheek. Three hours after dusk, Ramur and the twelve entered the temple ; the fires were burning, and the tablets that had lain closed for three hundred years lay upon the altar. It was a night big with fate, and the gods of the temple groaned with fear and pain. At the dead hour, the virgin that had been sought and found, entered the temple, and, at the command of Ramur, took her stand at the altar. As she laid her hand upon the tablets of destiny, the gods of the temple again groaned, and the temple shook as though an impious eye were looking on. At the command of Ramur, the virgin opened the tablets, aud announced a desert and two beings, viz: \u2014 an aged man, and a fair youth with the shade of long years upon him. Tablet the second announced these beings at the gates of a smiling city, which, by bribing the sentry, they entered. Tablet the third revealed a death- spreading plague for months, then famine and destruction and death. Tablet the fourth revealed this sentence \u2014 \" Such the doom of Ralah !\" At this announcement the gods again groaned, the priests fell down in fear, the watch-fire9 ceased tojburn, and the temple became wrapped in darkness. 28th May,\u2014 On recovering, the priests discovered with dismay that the vestal had disappeared. Search being made, one of the doors if the temple was discovered unbarred ; a proof that come impious hand had been the cause of her abduction. The spy of the temple was instantly summoned and sent forth to hunt down the sacrilegious wretch. At dusk the spy returned, and said\u2014'* Thus far has my search been fruitless.\" 29th May. \u2014 Like the two preceding days, the heat was intense \u2014 still the spy went forth on his hunting errand, and at dusk returned \u2014 his search fruitless! In the night the altar for the burning, and the knife for cutting out his heart, were prepared for the abductor of the temple's vestal.\" \" Shall Kamul now add that the abductor is found?\" added the scribe, when he had finished reading the diary. \" No\u2014 he has nat vet been discovered,\" answered the high-priest. \" But our spy is ou his track\u2014 he cannot long escape the just wrath of the indignant gods. But to the matter\u2014 Kamul hath spent his days in the service of the temple\u2014"], [27, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 19 Kamul hath read the book of creeds and the book of legends\u2014 doth Kamul remem ber reading either in the creed book or legend volume anything consorting with the fearful beings spoken of by the vestal ? The scribe reflected a moment. \"Hath Ramur ever read of the King of the Magii ?\" said he, slowly. \" Out on thee !\" answered the priest, impatiently. '* Thou know'st full well my holy calling banishes all such follies. Save in the gods, there is no mystery to baffle human wisdom.\" \" Kamul would not impose upon his superior,\" said the scribe, calmly ;\" he bath read the legend volume, and the doings of the Santon King are writ theie n.

THE LEGEND OF THE SANTON KING. In the nineteen hundredth year of time, there dwelt in Nod, in the land of Egypt a descendant of Cush, named Arazah. He trafficked in herbs and drugs, and was a man of wondrous heart and knowledge. He could tell the mission on earth of the smallest flower, as well as that of the largest tree. He explored caverns and streams in search of knowledge, and had such a command with his eye over the fowls of the air, the beasts of the land, and the fishes of the sea, that they did just as he bade them. So great was his fame, that students came from all parts of the world to learn of him. What to the mass of men was wonder, and mystery, was to him simple as the heat generated by a flaming pile. Of the thousands that flocked to him he chose the bravest, and built a large temple, and called it the college of Santons. In this temple he taught his students the uses of the things of air, water, earth ; and so many and marvellous were his revelations, that his scholars called him king, and from that time forth he was known and noted as the Santon King, or King of the Magii. So great was his knowledge, that all men feared him, and he possessed more power than all the rulers of the country. Of an immensely acute and comprehensive mind, he could read the ocean, and the sea, and the air, and his eye was so brilliant that it could pierce the thickest and the murkiest clouds. In the pursuit of knowledge, he was severely persever ing, and never gave up a study till he had mastered it. He could split a rock with one wave of his wand, which was of an ivory colour, and shatter a tree into a thousand fragments with the same magic power. He was a being of might, though small in stature , all things were to him as nothing ; he made sport of everything, and sighed for something worthy of his immense mind. So mighty and grasping, and overpowering and lucid, was his intellect, that his own followers \u2014 the wisest men of their day \u2014 were awe-struck by its grandeur, and revered their master as one of a greater and mightier world. Nothing \u2014 so vast and comprehensive was his mind \u2014 puzzled him ; he could unravel with wonderful ease the most complicated of earth's mysteries. His mind was a great, but an evil one ; he loved vice more than virtue ; he cared not for the timid \u2014 he scorned the brave \u2014 he loathed all garbed in the robes of power. Conscious of the superiority of his intellect, he felt and spoke like some noble and mighty being who had accidentally fallen down into an interior sphere. The fame of Arazah, the Santon King, and that of his followers, spread all over the world. He could, at will, walk on the sea as on the land ; he could create a whirlwind, and, with the power of his wand, allay a storm ; he could bring rain down from the clouds, and hide the sun ; he could root up trees with a single word, and send them flying through the air ; he could ride without danger, the lion, the tiger, the alligator, the mastodon, and the whale."], [28, "20 THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. With his wand, Arazah was everything \u2014 without it, nothing. It had five chambers \u2014 four at the base and one at the summit. The four lewer chambers contained four vapours ; the first breeding panic \u2014 the second, strangling heat \u2014 the third, pestilence\u2014 the fourth, famine ; \u2014 while the chamber at the top contained a small well of elixir\u2014 the mere inhaling of which gave to the breather a life coeval with that of time. This elixir, \u2014 which he had found in the centre of a diamond buried in a cavern that had been the resort and nestling-place of serpents \u2014he had applied to his own nostrils and those of his two sons, while the latter were asleep ; thereby securing to himself perpetual life, and perpetual youth to his sons. Attached te this elixir was a vapour that, to all but its first inhaler, left in the soul of its breathers a worm which destroyed at the end of every two years all memory of the past ; so that, gifted with life equal to that of time, she sons of Arazah could never, at any one moment, trace memory back beyond a period of two years. \" But I shall be with them to inform them of all the pleasant events of the past, and therefore the loss of memory will be as nothing compared with the blessings attendant on perpetual youth and life,\" said the Santon King Arazah. Vain man! he had not yet, for all his wisdom, learned that the conscious loss of any one attribute is a curse that nothing but its recovery can remedy. As years flew on, the Santon King increased in pride and knowledge. Puffed and swelled with the consciousness of his power and knowledge he sought to pene trate the mysteries of heaven and hell. He went up to the top of a mountain in the midst of a terrible tempest, and invoked the presence of the Creator and that of Astaroth the fallen. Immediately the tempest lulled, and a spirit, so majestic and grand that the sight of it made the Santon all but tremble, appeared to him, saying, \u2014 \" Mortal ! thou hast called me. What wouldst thou with me ? \" I know all the mysteries of thine earthly handiwork ; 1 would now [learn the mysteries of thyself,\" answered the Santon. Au^expression of melancholy and pity now appeared on the face of the spirit, and it'said, \u2014 \"Rash mortal; for thy pride and presumption, justice demands that thou pay a penalty equal to that of thy crime. Therefore do I pronounce this judgment against thee :\u2014 Never more shalt thou and thy sons know peace or comfort ; to thine own and all other lands shalt thou and thy sons be aliens ; on foot thou shalt henceforth travel from clime to clime, and uever more know joy or rest. Though I cannot kill thee, inasmuch as thou hast inhaled the elixir of perpetual life, yet shalt thou and thy sons feel keenly as the bite of a serpent the miseries of life; ye shall yearn and pray for death. Albeit, there is a grave marked out for ye, yet shall ye never find it. Ages and ages shall pass, and till the hour that thou repentest, and casteth away thy wand, never shall ye know one moment's joy or one moment's rest. Thy love for thy children shall be increased, and that shall be thy punishment. Till the hour that thy pride and love shall have passed away, and repentance oozeth from thy inmost soul, we shall net meet again. Farewell !\" And with a sad brow the agrieved spirit flew heavenward, and disappeared in the azure. \u2022 But the haughty and arrogant Santon treated the words of the spirit with ridicule and laughter. r \"The spirit speaks as if I were a common mortal,\" he muttered, with a scornful smile. \" Which thou art not,\" said a voice near him The Santon turned round, and beheld the evil one standing on a olobe of fire over a yawning abyss. \u00b0 olu\"c ul \"'<-. \" Right, right,\" answered the Santon, in no wise daunted at the fiend. \"But I have need of thee,\" he added calmly, and surveying with keen and bold eye the lineaments of the being before him. J ' lc \" Well,\" said the fiend, sternly."], [29, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 21 \" I would quit this puny earth, and conspire with thee to dethrone yon haughty one above.\" The fiend smiled grimly. \" Earth to me is a childish scene only,\" continued the Santon, scornfully ; \" I would go into some sphere where spirits congenial meet one at every turn ; I would mingle among spirits worthy of my own great mind.\" The fiend was thoughtful, awhile. At length, \u2014 \" Thou must first absolve thee from all human ties,\" said he. \" I'll do it,'' said the Santon, eagerly . \" Thy children\u2014\" The Santon started. The fiend smiled grimly. \" Wilt tear thyself away from them?\" ssid he. The Santon was bewildered at this question. Much as he scorned the world, \u2014 and that was his greatest feeling \u2014 even so much he loved, yea, idolised he his children. f \"Wilt tear thyself away from them?\" repeated the fiend, with a smile o mockery. The Santon paused, irresolute. \"To thy mission !\" cried the fiend, divining his thoughts. \"To thy mission, man I\" and with a scornful laugh, he suddenly disappeared. And the Santon left the mountain, confused, suspicious, fearful. On reaching his home, he found his youngest son sitting by the hearth, and weeping. \"Why weepest thou, Armah?\" said the Santon, in surprise. For Armah was of a timid, nervous, affectionate disposition, and Arazah loved him beyond his own soul. \" Why weepest thou, Armah, my son beloved ?\" repeated the Santon, tenderly. \" Ravanah \u2014 \" sobbed the youth. \"|What of him?\" cried the Santon, starting. \" He hath been captured by a band of Judeans, and borne into Judea,\" sobbed the youth in heart-breaking tones. The brow of the Santon King grew black with fear and wrath. He rushed forth and waving his wand, exclaimed, \u2014 \" On Judea shall be visited the four phials of Arazah's wrath \u2014 young and old, the strong and feeble, the lion-hearted and the timid, shall feel the power of Arazah the Santon King. Ho, Armah!\" he cried, \"come thou along, and shelter thee under my left arm. Thou shalt witness Arazah's vengence on the thieves of Judea.\" And onward they sped, the Santon King and his youngest son \u2014 onward, till they reached the Nile. '' Halt, Armah !\" cried the Santon, \" here, boy 1 Slow travelling thus afoot ; we'll have the kindly aid of yon crocodile.\" And the youth halted, and the Santon, waved his wand and bade a huge croco dile swimming in the river to approach and bear them to Judea. But the crocodile heeded him not, and swam on, as if the Santon had not spo ken. The brow of Arazah now became black ; but the next moment it paled to the hue of death ; for a thought \u2014 a conviction \u2014 had flashed through his brain. \" The spirit hath taken away my power and crippled me !\" he exclaimed, clasp ing his hands in terror. \" I am now but a mere mortal !\" And the great heart of the Santon King for a moment failed him. Tears stood in his eyes \u2014 his frame shook \u2014 his black hair became frosted, and his dark beard blanched to the colour of snow. But one hundred and eighty years, he suddenly felt old. The conviction of his powerlessness had revolutionised his entire aspect and system. Despite of all this, the great heart of Arazah returned to him. His aroused spirit gleamed in his eyes, and, trembling with passion, he raised his white wand aloft, and gazing at the sky, cried aloud,\u2014"], [30, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 22 \"Tbe four phials of death are left me still. My children and I have inhaled the eternal elixir, and thou, thou canst give me anguish, yet thou canst not kill us. I wage an eternal and relentless war against thee and thine. Spirit of this puny sphere, I defy thee !\" And wildly the Santon King shook his clenched fist up at the sky. And an angry deafening peal from the skiey vault answered his defiance. \" Come on, Armah ! come, on, my son beloved ! Let's lose jio time ; forjo, thy brother and my son are in the hands of the vile Judeans ! And taking his son Armah by the left hand, Arazah the Santon King moved on ward toward Judea. And all the way young Armah wept, for dearly loved he his brother. And all the way Arazah cursed the spirit that had taken away his power. Entered they at last Judea. And the Santon sought for his son Ravanah ; but Ravanah had the night before escaped, and none knew whither. And Arazah was shown the spot where the Judeans had plaeed his son, and the door by which he had escaped, and the sand before the door. The Santon examined his son's footprints in the sand, and traced them miles on miles, and leagues on leagues up to the western gates of Assyria. And on his quitting Judea, a fearful panic seized the people ; anon, a sweeping pestilence \u2014 and ere thirty days had passed, five-sixths of the Judeans slept in their winding sheets. And in Assyria, the Santon sought his son ; but he found him not ; and at the eastern gates of the city he again sound the soot- prints of his son Ravanah; and the Santon and his son Armah followed the footprints up to Gaza \u2014 then Gihon \u2014 then to Jerusalem \u2014 but never found him ; for at every city that he came to, he found the youth Ravanah had left it the night before. And so onward and onward, the world around, Arazah traversed to find his son; and so on must he traverse till Jehovah saith to time \u2014 \" Lie thee down, thou hoary one \u2014 lie thee down, and die !\" Ramur, the high-priest, was silent and thoughtful for some minutes after Ka mul's relation of the legend ; his eyes the while fixed on tbe downcast orbs of the scribe, as if to read there whether he held film belief or not in what their owner had just related. \" Ramur thanks Kamul for his narration of the legend,\" said he at 'ength, and rising. \" We will discourse upon it, at some future day. Adieu!\" And drawing his robes closer about him, the high-priest left the library : his slow step and earnest brow attesting how deep the impression made upon him by the legend CHAPTER VI. THISBE. It was in the evening of the day when Ramul the scribe had related the Egyptian legend. The grey bad disappeared \u2014 the black clouds had give place to fleecy ones of white, and these sailed lazily along twixt the earth and sky. As the white masses moved eastward, here and there could be discovered a bright, gleaming star, smiling hopefully in the azure dome. Anon, as the snowy sheets thinned and broke, the moon, belted with a hos. of brilliants, burst forth in"], [31, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 23 all her radiance and beauty, like a sudden glare of light in some lone hall of dark ness. Not more gladdening a reinforcement to the hearts of a small brave band strug gling against a mighty host than were the return of air and moonlight to the heat-suffering people ; and as the moonsheen burst through the fleecy clouds, a loud, stirring, deafening shout went up from their grateful hearts, and joy reigned once more in'ltalah. On the outskirts of the town, wh^re dwelt the poorest and wretchedest, \u2014 in a hut whose floor and walls were of baked mud, and whose roof was thatched with bamboo canes, and intersticed with clay, \u2014 in the farthest corner of this hut, crouched \u2014 despite the copper hue of her skin\u2014 one of the loveliest beings that ever breathed the air of earth. With nought to hide her nudity save a small strip of linen wound round her loins, \u2014 her long, black hair banging like a robe around ber neck and shoulders, \u2014 her laige dark eyes turned fearfully towards the door, \u2014 her finely moulded arms crossing her breast, as if to hide the tempting charms of her bosom, \u2014 there in that corner, we say, adovvn on her knees, leaning against the wall, crouched a female, in terror. Take away that maiden's copper-colour, and give her the complexion of the maidens born and reared in the lands of the West, and the syren that undid Anthony, the houri that caused the destruction of Troy, the famed beauty and heroine of Saragossa, were not more lovely. In her eyes, fringed with long, silky lashes, were the light and the softness and winningness and blackness and fire and yearning of love ; in her limbs \u2014 so full, so voluptuously carved, so delicately moulded, so beautifully fashioned, so bewil deringly perfect\u2014 in her features, \u2014 but who shall define them 1 Who trace with cold distinctness the sweetness and perfect volume of her fine, polished forehead \u2014 the archingness of her silky brows \u2014 the fulness and ripeness of her Hebean cheeks \u2014 the small, straight, delicately nostrilled nose \u2014 the lusciousness of her small tempting lips \u2014 the beauty of hev slightly-rounded and delicately-pointed chin ? Who dwell with cold nicety on the full, rich neck \u2014 the rich contour of her finely rounded shoulders \u2014 the full beating bosom \u2014 the small, full aims, \u2014 the delicate, tapering fingers \u2014 the lovely contour of her ripe, full limbs ? In the corner of that hut, crouched that maii in terror \u2014 her bright ees ! ' fearful, half meltingly imploring, directed towards the door, as if watching the coming of one she loved, yet dreaded. And the night was beautiful ; the arching sky hung with a silver moon and brightly gleaming stars, and the west- winds \u2014 soft, cooling, balmy\u2014 stealing through space, gently banishing heat, softly fanning the cheek, and whispering low sighs. The furniture of that hut was scant \u2014 a mat and a low table, and a wooden dish and a stew-pan, and a brown pitcher being all. It was three hours after the rising of the moon \u2014 hard on to mid-night \u2014 the streets all silent \u2014 nothing abroad but the air, nothing heard save the low mur miurings of the Ganges, It was at this hour that the open door of the maiden's hut was darkened by a human figure. Unlike the son? of Ralah, long, dark hair crowned his head, and his skin bronzed by the sun only. Unlike the sons of Ralah, he wore a coarse grey shirt, loose, square at the neck, and reaching almost to his knees. Unlike the sons of Ralah, sandals saved his feet frsm all contact with the earth. A broad high massive forehead \u2014 small, black, lustrous, perfectly-shaped eyes \u2014 a straight, aquiline nose \u2014 a jetty moustache\u2014 a thin, arching upper-lip \u2014 the lower one full, bold, sensual \u2014 a prominent and pointed chin \u2014 a short, thick, superbly chisseled throat \u2014 all these were his. His arms were naked, as Were his limbs from the knees downward. In height, he might have been about five feet ten inches \u2014 more rather than less. Withal a magnificent being \u2014 a model of God's images ; fit for any sphere and any life ; a being to win female hearts and lead even the peerless in chains. So looked the youth that darkened the door of the hut is the farthest corner of which crouched the maiden Thisbe."], [32, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 24 And as he entered, his eyes fell on the maiden, half in .triumph, half in antici pative joy. , , , , . . ,, And the heart of that maiden thrilled, and her eyes responded to his in a melt ing, imploring tone ; they swam in lustre and in light\u2014 there was a cry of pity, mercy, in them. And yet the heart of the maiden was in that wild, thrilling state understood as half on fire. . Her lips were parted\u2014 just revealing the tips of two rows of pearly, glistening teeth \u2014 as if yearning yet fearing to speak. \" Thisbe,\" said the young man, advancing. \" Thisbe !\" How like a charm upon the senses falls that being's voice upon the ear. It is not the voice of one human ; it is like the entrancing tones of one sent by Astaroth on earth to lure away the pride and the honour and the soul of woman. it is low, soft, meltin-:. sirenic ; falling like music on the ear, entering the heart, subduing and making captive the soul. Wo ! wo ! to the angel oues of earth if that voice falls upon the ear ! \" Thisbe !\" \" Being ?\" answered the vestal, trembling. There was something so mournful, fearful, reproachful, yearning in that one word of the maiden. \" Thisbe !\" Again ! the voice of the being is like the chirp of a wren when seeking for its mate. On the maiden it falls like the fascinating power of the serpent. \" Thisbe !\" The tone of that voice is now changed to one of a mournful ca dence ; and still it charms, fascinates. The breast of the vestal shook with a strange feeling. '.' Thisbe does not rise to welcome him who loves her !\" Ah ! the plaintive melody, the spell-binding music of his voice. Like one obeying a power that she fearfully adored, the maiden ?lowly rose, and, her hands still hiding her bosom, her eyes meeting his as if drawn to them by magic, she slowly advaneed and halted within a few paces of the youth. But one word escaped her \u2014 \"Mercy!\" The circles belting the dark pupils of the eyes of the being radiated with fear ful brilliancy ; his lips twitched, and his every muscle quivered with passion. A smile danced in his eye and played around his mouth ; and as his lips parted, two rows of small, pearly, parfectly-formed teeth gleamed, jewel-like, in that dull lighted hut. That smile of triumph was tbe only answer made by the being to the heart cleaving appeal of the vestal. Thisbe, as she raised her eyes and met that glance, felt her heart sink as if it were leaving her for ever ; and her clasped hands fell from her breast in anguish. Tbe voice of the being recalled her. \" Thisbe !\" The vestal raised her eyes. \" Thisbe does not fear him who lo\\es her? \"Thisbe cannot love the being,\" said the vestal, in a low, tremulous voice. \" The gods will not let her.\" A look of scorn now passed over the features of the beieg. \" The goda make but cannot control the heart,\" said he. \" 'Tis a human feeling, and not a power on high that keeps thy heart from leaping tu the embrace of mine. Is there no longing in the breast of Thisbe?\" \" Her heart hath sunk,\" said the vestal. A shade swept over the brow of the being. \" It should bound \u2014 spring up at thought or sight of me,\" he muttered, inaudibly. \" If on man and woman this feeling acteth alike, why sinks thy heart when it should bound, with a leap of fire, as mine doth?\" he added, aloud. There was something in the tone of this interrogatory that caused the virgin lo look up to the being with mingled feelings of awe, astonishment, and hope."], [33, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 25 \" If Thisbe's heart doth not so bound, the being will not harm her,\" she said. naively. \" Harm thee \u2014 harm Thisbe!\" The voice thrilled the vestal. It was as if some magic charm had fallen like a sudden shaft, and, for a moment, stayed the current of her blood. The veins of the virgin softened, and her blood resumed its customary courses. Benighted as was that Indian maid in human lore, yet lacked she not those mental springs, which, when touched, set the whole machinery of the brain in motion. Deeply pondered she upon the mysterious power of the being's voice that now enchained, and anon set free her senses and the life-stream that sustained their action. And a feeling \u2014 deeper than before\u2014 of awe crept over her. And she felt helpless. \"'.Spare me\u2014 mercy !\" These were her woids, spoken in a voice tremulous, No, 4."], [34, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 26 \"1 yearned all day for the coming of night,\" said the being ; \" for with the approach of night my day's toil dies. I yearned for the coming of that hour because I could then be again with Thisbe. Never before knew I so long a day; the moments crawled when they should have flown; the minutes were years, the hours, ages.

A shade darkened ' the brow of the being. A fire\u2014 half malicious\u2014 gleamed <i his eyes. \"I feared this,\" he muttered. \"I have lived too long in Ralah ; for if the priests of the temple should happen to get that same idea, they would roast me for a wizard! What means Thisbe by calling me a mystery?\" he added, aloud. ''Thou'rt not like other men \u2014 for thou'rt alike impervious to prayers and steel and poi \" The vestal checked herself; but the being caught up the word she had broken. \" Poison !\" he exclaimed, with a laugh of scorn. '' Of all Ralah, who has dared attempt to poison me?\" Thisbe was silent. \" In the name of the gods, I charge thee, answer !\" \"My brother,\" faltered the vestal. A smile lit up the features of the being. \" Krishnu will remember him for it in the hour of judgment. Thou art right, Thisbe ; nor bane nor prayers nor keen-edged creese can harm this flesh, nor cut me from existence. Many have tried, but none could succeed in robbing me of life. My eye is too keen \u2014 my hands too quick \u2014 my eats too sharp \u2014 my limbs too lithe\u2014 my feet too fleet, for any to compete with me. 'Tis folly in man or woman to aggrieve or resist me. Never yet, in pastime or in danger, have I suffered even so much as an instant's pain. I have played with the tiger, the leopard, the crocodile and the shark, and always unharmed, untouched, unscathed. I have wrestled with the lithest and strongest \u2014 and, for sport, have fought with the creese aud the javelin, with men of cunning dexterity and strength, and alwavs trium phantly.

The gods give them me for pastime.\" The vestal shuddered ; not so much at his words as the tone in which they were spoken, and the looks that accompanied them ; for the circles of the being's eyes had again radiated and the pupils expanded. The same smile of triumph that shone in his feature- at his entrance was now resume^ ; and as before, it fell like a charm upon the senses of the vestal. And she stood in a perilous strait, that poor, friendless, kinless maiden. 'Twixt her and foul, everlasting shame, what bar supervened ? Not one\u2014 of any kind ; of any shape \u2014 nor of heaven, or of eatth.

She had implored in vain for mercy \u2014 if she should scream, what slumbering ear would waken, what mind comprehend or heed, what foot fly, what hand strike for her rescue? The being before her \u2014 his frame expressed it\u2014 was bold, lithe, sinewy, strong, deathless. 'Gainst him, who dared raise a hand ; if any dared, who could, successfully ? Lo \u2014 her strait ! A virgin she \u2014 nay, a vestal \u2014 one who had been gifted by the gods with power to read and reveal the tablets of futurity ; strong passioned in blood, yet her mind steeped in the waters of her native creed, impassioned too in the faith of a devotee ; with this one sentence\u2014 whispered her amid the rites of her noviciate \u2014 ringing like a warning-peal in all the chambers of her brain, \" The vestal soever that yieldeth to man what she hath consecrated to Knishnu, shall be for ever cut off from Paradise and given to the Evil One,\" with one before her, superhuman it might be, yet still deeply laden with the fire and ardency of full-blooded youth. Lo \u2014 her strait ! His fascinating eyes fixed still on hers \u2014 his breath falling like lustful dew upon her nude frame, his very presence chaining her like some poor spirit whom the gods had deserted, no warm love in her heart to render pleasing her sacri fice, cut off from love, from hope on earth ; doomed \u2014 such the tenour of the high-priest's warning \u2014 to the cruel hands of the Relentless One, everlasting in the future. * Lo\u2014 her strait ! \" Thisbe must love me,\" said the being, in a dulctt voice ; \" the gods will it, and I crave it.

It was the hour when, as the sons of superstition tell, uneasy spirits stalk, chain* less, through the world. Surprised, the heing turned his head ; but nothing met his eyes.

CHAPTER VII THE PILGRIMS. ft The sub was gleaming high in the heavens\u2014 belching its fiery heat aud golden sheen upon the broad desert. The glistening sands shone like brilliants on a track less plain. The air teemed with sand-flies so small as to be invisible to the naked eye ; and yet their stings drew blood and created the most tormenting pains. Afar in the \u00abast, shaping their course westward, might be seen two pilgrims tra versing the burning sands as traverse the sons of Arabia \u2014 sandalless. Seen as they are in the vista, they present a picture reminding one of the old patriarchal times, when youth and age walked haud in hand together on their way to worship. Lovingly, hand in hand, they approach ; the hoary one and the youth. Lithely, too, they walk; more like soldiers on a holiday march, than two au dienceless pilgrims on a deser t of pale sands, the sun pouring its fire down upon them, the sand-flies swarming around them, the white sands burning beneath them \u2014 so lithe, sedate, and regular their tread. As they approach, their features become more distinct, and their characters traceable. The elder of the two is remarkable for the roughness of his bronzed skin ; the loftiness of his bald forehead, the straightness of his brows, the piercing fierceness of his bold, grey eyes, the length of his pale beard, the meagreness of his short frame, and the short grey shirt running from his right shoulder \u2014 leaving bare the lest breast \u2014 to his knees; his right hand carries a staff, the height of its owner, and of a pale, ivory hue. The younger, from the outline of his features, is doubtless a relative of the hoary pilgrim; his hair, black and silky, falls in ringlets adown his bronzed neck ; his brow, like that of the aged one beside him, high, full, massive ; his eyes, fringed with long, jetty lashes, dark, lustrous, and beaming with melancholy; his nose long and aquiline; his upper lip shaded by a moustache, full, ruby-like and shaped like a bow ; his lower one full, slightly prominent and delicately carved ; his small, slender chin, protruding to a point ; his neck, short, slender ; his shoulders square ; his arms, protected by the sleeves of his grey shirt 'or tunic, moulded as if for models; his chest full and deep ; his waist slender ; his hands small, and his fingers tapering like a woi.. au's; his lower limbs cast in the most delicate and perfect shape. There i\u00bb a longing, languishing expression in his beautifu features as if"], [37, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 29 his heart were steeped in melancholy at some terrible grief. Seen at a glance, he looks as if some strange power had flung upon his youthful lineaments the shadowy outlines of age. \" Much farther have we to go, father?\" Thus speaks the youth, in a voice that tells of weariness and long travel. \" No, boy,\" responded the hoary pilgrim ; \" we have passed the longest part of the desert. The sun is already rushing down the west, ere long we will seek re pose. Art weary, my son beloved?\" \" Not very, very weary, father.\" \" But still thou would'st like rest ?\" \" Yes, dear father.\" \" Well \u2014 well, Armah, when the sun is down, we will seek repose.\" \"To-morrow we shall see Ravanah \u2014 shall we not, father ?\" \" If we reach Ralah in time,\" replied the aged pilgrim, hoarsely. \" Think'st thou we shall be in Ralah to-morrow, father?\" \" Hardly, Armah. The desert is long.\" The youth sighed, and they journeyed on for some minutes in silence. \" 'Tis near two years since we have seen him \u2014 is't not, father ?\" \" Hard on to that time, boy, I believe,\" answered the old man, coughing. \" And we have done nought but travel since in search of him. 'Tis a wonder we find him not \u2014 is't not, father ?\" \" A marvellous wonder, Armah. How hot the sun is!\" * \" Is't so hot in Ralah, think'st thou, father ?\" \" I think not, boy. Why.'\" \" Ravanah must suffer so, if it is !'' The old man coughed again. \" Ever thinking of his brother!\" he muttered. \" We have been a good while on the desert, father !'' \"Ay, boy, five long days.\" \" Shall we soon see the end of it, father V \" If we speed fast, boy.\" \"But it is so hot, father!\" \" True, Armah\u2014 it is hot.\" \" It seems to me as if it were always hot when we travel, father.\" \" It seems so, indeed.\" \" When crossing the desert of Sahara, we met a caravan \u2014 do you remember ii father ?\" \"Ay, boy.\" \" There were camels and horses and dromedaries, and many of the traveller were mounted \u2014 dost remember, father ?\" , \u201e \" Ay, Armah, full well.\" \" A thought struck me then.'\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes \u2014 guess it!\" *' You thought the camels patient ?\" \" No.\" \" You thought the horses noble ?\" \" No.\" \" You thought the caravan was large ?\" \" No.\" \" I give it up.\" \u25a0 \" I thought this, father.

Our feet would never blister then.\" The old man groaned. \"AVhat is the matter, father? Have I said anything to pain thy heart V asked the youth, anxiously. \" No, Armah, no,\" answered the old man, wringing his hands. \" I have a pain in my breast, and it rages suddenly at times \u2014 that's all.\" \"I feared I had said something that wounded you?\" '\" No, no \u2014 no, Armah, no !\" \" The pain is very sharp at times *\" \" Very \u2014 but it is all gone now.\" \"Oh, I'm so glad, father,\" cried the youth, his countenance radiating with delight.

Sometimes his fire scorches you and makes you suffer ; then I wish him gone. When he burns me, I don't mind it much, because.I am with you. When you are jaded and weary, then T wish him gone, that we may lie down together in each other's arms, and rest,\" \" Thou'rt a good boy, Armah !\" \u25a0' Am I, father ? In very earnest ?\" \" In very earnest, boy !\" \" I am glad of it, father ; if I were wicked, you would be unhappy , and it makes my heart cry whenever you look sad !\" The old man wrung his hands, and they walked on. The sun had now disappeared\u2014 its straggling beams had ceased to gild the clouds. Twilight reigned. \" Let us halt, Armah,\" said the hoary pilgrim ; \" night is coming. Let us halt here.\" And they sat them down on the sands. \" Art thirsty, Armah V said the old man, slinging round his wallet, and draw ing forth a flask and some scraps of meat and fruit. \" A little, father. \" Here is wine, pure juice, boy. It slakes the thirst, invigorates the body, and revives the drooping heart. Drink, boy, drink !\" \" We'll be much happier father, when 'we find Ravanah\u2014 won't we ?\" \"Yes Armah yes.

Oh, my soul ! when, when shall I know hope, or forgetfulness, or rest ?\" A low wind, at this moment, swept past him, and he heard the words \u2014 \" Never, till thou repentest !\" \" Who speaks ?\" he cried, starting to his feet. \" Who speaks ?\" \" Truth !\" whispered a zephyr, passing him. \" Take then a form tangible that I may see thee !\" cried the pilgrim, imperiously.

At this moment, a dark and fleecy cloud crept over the face of the moon, and a moan was heard in the sky. \" I spoke too harshly,\" muttered the pilgrim through his closed teeth ; \" and lo ! yon creeping clouds cry out against me ! \"Tis ever thus with the crippled and the fallen,\" he added, bitterly; \"and the victor's puny satellites crawl out from their insignificance to exalt his greatness by crying out against his foe ! I spoke too harshly, and yon creeping things murmur at my impiety ! Oh for a power to sweep them and their master's power into nothingness !\" As he spoke, he flung him wildly down upon the sauds ; and at the same moment a mass of black clouds rushed, with a booming roar, athwart the face of the moon, and the desert was steeped in darkness. \" More proofs of my extreme impiety !\" muttered the pligrim, with a smile of mockery; \"attesting too, in argument convincive, that though fallen, crippled, I am not all powerless ; for lo ! how a few words fresh-drawn from this stout, stub- born heart, have lashed his cringing satellites into wrath ! Ha ! ha ! for my sake \u2014 for mv simple words \u2014 the puny short-lived creatures of this fawning earth are cut off from\u2014 light ! Ha ! ha !\" And a laugh of bitter mockery again burst from that hoary pilgrim's lips. Then paused he, \u2014 his frame distended \u2014 his breast to the earth \u2014 his hoary chin resting in the palms of his upraised hands \u2014 his eyes staring coldly up at the dark thick sky. A low cry \u2014 like that borne on the breeze \u2014 now burst on his ears. \" 'Tis his voice !\" he cried, springing up with the agility of youth; \" 'tis my vagabond son's \u2014 Ravanah 's ! Where is he? He cries for help! I'd know his voice amid legions ! A thousand times I've heard it \u2014 where \u2014 \" He paused again \u2014 for at his foot, a similar cry rose faintly on the air. The pilgrim dropped upon his knees and placed his hands upon the brow and breast of the sleeping youth \u2014 the former was on fire, and the latter throbbed fear fully. \"Aye, I remember now,'' said the pilgrim, recovering from his alarm ; \"this is the death-hour of another two years\u2014 at this moment, my two sons have lost all memory of the past. By to-morrow's dawn their lives will re-begin, like that of fresh born infants!''"], [40, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 32 CHAPTER VIII. THB NEW LIFE. Day was just breaking when the spy of the temple awoke Ab \u00b0P\u00abiedh\u00bb eyes, the vestal Thisbe sp.ang up with maiden modesty, and fell back a few paces. The being looked around him in astonishment, and, as his eyes fell on the he gazed at her inquiringly. \" Where am I ?\" he asked. , , , , . , The vestal hesitated to answer ; for the simplicity of the being filled her with astonishment. , ... . , ,, \u201e\u201e\u201efi, \" Who art thou ? What place is this ? Where am I ?\" repeated the youth \" I am the vestal Thisbe, whom thou didst steal from the temple, replied the maiden, marvelling at his manner. The being looked at her in amazement. \" What sayst thou ?\" . . , , The maiden repeated her words ; and the youth put his hand to his neao. thoughtfully. r, . \" I remember nothing of it\u2014 thou dost jest !\" he said, laughing. What temple did 1 steal thee from ?\" \" The temple of Ravanah.\" \" Is it wrong to steal a maiden from the temple of Ravanah V he asked. \"It is death\u2014 it is torture. The priests will burn thee alive for the deed,' answered the vestal. \" What place is this?\" said the being, apparently bewildered. \"Ralah!\" \" Ralah ! it is a pretty name ! Have I lived before, maiden ?\" he added, turn ing his eyes on those of the vestal, inquiringly. Thisbe was filled with astonishment. Could this be the being whose cunning mind and serpent tongue had lured her to the temple ? Could this be the youth whose mysterious power had wrought so much of woe to her and hers, who had stolen her in the lone and silent hours of darkness from the very altar, and borne her where none would think of seeking her \u2014 who, but a few hours previously, had caused her so much misery and alarm ? Could he \u2014 for all his apparent cunning \u2014 be one of those wretched beings whom Heaven, for purposes of its own, had cut off from the light of reason ? She was puzzled \u2014 amazed \u2014 alarmed. \" You do not answer me !\" said the youth, smiling. \" You ask me a strange question ?\" stammered the maiden. \" I thought you could answer it,\" said the youth, ingenuously ; \" as for me, I remember nothing.'' There was something in the simplicity of this remark, and the glance accompany- ing it, that perplexed, and at the same time created in the heart of the vestal a strong interest for the youth. If he spoke truly \u2014 if Heaven had actually taken away his memory \u2014 then the being stood in such peril as he dreamt not of; for the abduction of a vestal from the temple was a crime of such magnitude, and was attended with such terrible consequences, that the very thought made her shudder. Independently of this, the being was in the service of the'temple. If he had lost his memory, of course he could remember nothing connected with that fact or of its duties. If he attended not his duties that day, or, in other words, if he did not report himself to the temple, messengers would be sent in search of him. If found with the abducted vestal, nothing on earth could save him. As the maiden reflected thus, her interest in the youth increased stronger and deeper; and, all unthought by herself, a desire crept into her heart \u2014 a desire to save him. Meanwhile the youth lay pondering, with downcast eyes, upon the words of the"], [41, "THE ADVINTURES OF A VAGABOND. 33 ik vestal. It was in vain that he attempted to fathom their meaning. In vain he tried to think of anything connected with her abduction. He marvelled how he could have done it, without the power to remember it. Beyond the moment of his waking he could trace nothing. To him the past was a dead blank. \" She did but jest I\" This was his thought. He could arrive at no other conclusion. But how savthim ? This was the one great thought of the maiden. If he re\" mained in Ralah, it would be impossible to escape the eye aud hand of the Temple What resource then? He must fly? But how, and whither ! A problem this t pose a mind accustomed to the sinuosities of life, let alone the brain of that simple mAdndd as$she pondered, hours flew ; and the busy hum swelling on the air told \u2666w the craftsmen of the city were up and at their long day s toil. 'The youth must be warned, in all its details, of the danger in which he stood Aj,d she -without fear, without reserve, sat her down beside him, to recount what No a."], [42, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 34 be had done, and how he must deport himself, till he could fly far, far away, beyond the grasp of the long-armed Temple. Calmlv listened the youth ; every word of the fair maiden falling like music on his ears\u2014 his eyes the while fixed earnestly, admiringly, gratefully on hers. And when she had done, he sighed, and, still in his listening attitude, wished her to speak on. Aeain the maiden, as if to rivet them in his mind, rehearsed to the youth his vocation in the Temple, the deed he had committed, the danger that he ran, and the necessity of caution and of flying; and with each word grew stronger and deeper her fears for his safety. And the hours flew thus ; \"and, ere either was aware, the sun had gone down, the moon and stars had risen, and the soft zephyrs of even were playing around them. To this one fact arrived they at last : the youth must take ship and fly to a foreign land. Butfor this money was needed ; and the pockets of the being con tained not a single ana. Money must be had \u2014 but how\u2014 whence \u2014 where? The youth pondered ; anon, rose up \u2014 approached the door \u2014 looked forth. \" Expose not thyself, dear youth,\" whispered the vestal. But something at this moment suddenly caught the eye of the youth, and he strode forth. The moon shone clearly down upon the plain, which, here and there dotted by fruit trees that rose in all their leafy foliage from its bosom, spread out before the hut. At the base of a wide-spreading tree, scarce two hundred yards from the hut, were two men in conflict : the one in the white robes of a priest, the other in the rough garb of a sailor. As the youth rushed towards them, the priest by some agile trick had got his enemy prostrate, bending over him, ani planting one knee upon his breast, while his left hand grasped his throat, he drew from the deep folds of his pale dress a long, thin, sharp creese. Raising it on high, he described a series of semicircles, as if for the purpose of rendering more effective and certain his aim. As the steel was described for the last time and about to descend in full, deathly force upon the sailor, a quick, strong, agile hand seized his iron wrist, while another suddenly wrenched away the blade, and with a quick, swift movement plunged it deep into his side ; so deep and wide was the wound, that a thick purple stream leapt out with the withdrawal of the creese, and with a low, choked groan, the spriest fell back, covered with blood. Up sprang the sailor, quick as thought to thank his deliverer ; but no sooner did nis eyes fall upon him, than he started, and staggered against the tiee. \" The being !\" he exclaimed, in a voice of anguish. \" Is it to thee \u2014 who has caused all my misery \u2014 that Dick Willis must give thanks for his life ! \" Have I done wrong in saving thee ?\" said the youth, unable to comprehend the meaning of the sailor's words. \" I thank thee for that !\" cried the sailor. \" But thou hast brought upon me a whole world of misery beside. \"Dost wish toki'lmefor it ?\" said the youth, ingenuously, and offering him the creese- The sailor stared at him in astonishment. *' I have lost my memory,\" continued the youth, plaintively ; \" and the maiden says that I have done things that will bring on me the vengeance of the Temple, and that if I would escape death, I must fly. But I have no money to fly with ; and Thisbe says money is necessary.\" \"Thisbe\u2014\" gasped the agitated sailor. \"Where is Thisbe? I deemed her in the temple\u2014 the loss of her has crazed me\u2014 this priest was in search of her when I encountered him\u2014 I demanded him to restore her to me\u2014 he charged me with (falsehood impiety, and folly ;\u2014 we fought\u2014 love and hate on my side, superstition and wrath on his. \\V he re is Thisbe?\" \"I would escape, and must have money,\" was the sole answer of the vouth *' Where is Thisbe ?\""], [43, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 35 \" Hast thou money ?\" \" Tell me of Thisbe\u2014 \" \" I saved thee from the priest \u2014 I want money !\" \" Know'st thou as Thisbe, or dost thou play with me ?\" \" I am in no humour for playing. I have killed the man whose hand cas raised against thee. Is thy life worth money?\" \" Thou hast killed a priest.\" \" Give me money !\" \"Dost thou know what it is to kill a priest?\" \"I would fly \u2014 give me money!\" \" To kill a common man is terrible\u2014 but to murder a priest \u2014 \" \" Time flies, and so would I \u2014 money !\" \" To kill a priest, young man, is to bring down on thee such vengeance as man never yet dreamt of \u2014 \" \" Give me money, man \u2014 give me money !\" \"Tell me of Thisbe \u2014 where I may find her \u2014 or I'll inform of thee to the Temple \u2014 \" \" Money \u2014 money \u2014 I must fly ! \" \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed the sailor; \"thou would'st fly ? And yet hast n\u00bb money? Fool! The murder of yon priest shall be thy sacrifice \u2014 thy death! Thou shalt have thy heart ripped from thy breast \u2014 thy eyes shalt be plucked out and roasted \u2014 and thy flesh and bones shall squirm on the sacrificial altar !'' The youth looked at him fixedly, but spoke not. \" These lips shall inform against thee !\" said the sailor, his features distorted with all the passions of a beast, \" and these hands shall deliver thee to the iron grasp of the Temple. Wilt tell me where Thisbe is now ?\" he added, with a chuckle. The next moment, he lay upon the earth like one stunned, the being above him \u2014 his left hand wound round his broad throat, his right raised on high, as if to slay him for ever. But yet no passion darkened the face of the being. Fixed and rigid as iron were his pale features. \"Money!\" he exclaimed. And as if to add emphasis to the word, he gave an additional twist to the necker chief girdling the throat of the sailor. The muscles of the latter were now so excited that they seemed ready to split his veins swelled with wrath, like' purple rods laid upon his flesh. Conscious of the critical nature of his situation, he called every nerve and muscle to his aid : but in vain \u2014 the grasp of his foe was like that of steel. \" Money!\" repeated the being, in a low, thrilling voice. \"In\u2014\" The sailor could articulate no more : the tightness of his neckerchief had cut off his breath. The youth satisfied himself with one more twist at the neckerchief ; and the sailor \u2014 his maliciously-gleaming eyes bulging and almost leaping from their sockets \u2014 his veins swelling \u2014 his face black \u2014 became motionless, breathless, senseless. When conscious of the helpless state of his victim, the being loosened his grasp, and plunged his hands, instinctively, into the pockets of the sailor. A few pieces of gold and silver and a jack-knife were all his booty. Ripping open the blood stained robes with his creese, he discovered a full, heavy purse attached to a belt girdling the waist of the corpse. Severing the cords holding it to the belt, he hastily transferred it to his pocket \u2014 this done, he wiped the blood from the creese with an unstained fold of the priest s dress, and then rushed back to the hut, as hastily as he had left it. \" Behold I have money !\" he cried, holding up the purse, as he entered. \" Be hold, I have money !\" \" Where did you get it?\" cried Thisbe, springing up. \" No matter, so we have it !\" answered the youth. \" Half of it is thine, if tbou'lt accept it. Take it \u2014 thou'lt be rich !\""], [44, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 36 The eyes of the maiden dilated : the sight of so much gold bewildered her. Much feared she, too, that some means unlawful had obtained it. \" Shall I fly now, Thisbe\u2014 now that I have money ?\" demanded the youth. The question startled the maiden, and brought a burning flush to her brow. She had advised him to that course\u2014 the obstacle being a lack of money, mat obstacle was now removed-for lo ! he had a sack of gold. And yet the bare ques tion startled, pained her. For him to stay was death\u2014 to fly, all safety. A pang was in her heart. , t, ... \" Shall I fly now, Thisbe\u2014 now that I have money ?\" repeated the youth with a \" Who will take care of thee when thou art ill\u2014 who watch over thee when thou art in pain ?\" said the maiden, tremulously. \" I know not,\" answered the youth sadly. \"I could do it,\" said the maiden, half thoughtfully. \" Thou could'st !\" cried the youth, as if suddenly stricken with some luminous thought. \"Wilt thou fly with me?\" \" I will,\" wag the reply. \" The hour is beautiful \u2014 the streets lonely\u2014 w ecan walk forth unnoticed, unseen. Let us stroll through the city, and see whither we can fly.\" And they left the hut, and walked down the street towards the Ganges. As they neared the river, they heard the shrill creaking of fall tackles and the noise of a windlass. \" Let us run !\" cried the youth ; \" something tells me that the means of escape are at hand.\" They approached the pier, and beheld a number of sailors scattered over a ship ; some on deck, some running up the shrouds to unfurl the sails, and ethers working the windlass. \"How now?\" cried a man, leaning over the side, and addressing the youth. \" What want you here ?\" \" We want to take passage ?\" said the maiden, for her companion knew not how to answer. \" We are bound for America,\" said the mate, for such was the rank of the sail or ; \" you do not want to go there, surely ?\"( \" That is the very place we want to go to,\" said the girl. \"But you should have engaged passage before,\" said the' mate, \"it is too late now.' \" We could not get here before,\" said the girl. \u00ab We have come a long way\u2014 and all on foot \u2014 and we have but just arrived.\" \" But the passage money is heavy.\" \" We have plenty of gold to defray our expenses.

A regro came running towards them. \u00b0 uuuu' \" Iss, Massa Watson.\" \" Show this lacy to the cap'n'g cabin. Quick.\" \" Is, Massa Watson.\" \" Follow him,\" said the mate.

The latter was dressed in a showy but awkward manner, as if unaccustomed to the American style of dress. The two females looked at each other for some moments without speaking, as if striving to penetrate each other's secrets. Being left to themselves, how ever, they soon came to an understanding, and remained good friends durinw the voyage. \" Are you willing to lend a hand if we make your passage money a mere trifle ?\" continued the mate, addressing the youth. \"I will do anything to assist that one unaccustomed to ship life can do,\" said the youth. \" All right,\" returned the mate ; \" we'll soon teach you how to make yourself useful. Cast off the hawser,\" he added, \"and all aboard.\" Everything being ready, the gallant merchantman left her moorings, and glided down the river and out into the sea like a thing of life. The stirring wind bent the spreading canvass, and the noble ship ploughed oyer the shoreless main like a roused warrior rushing on to conquest. Two days afterwards the cholera burst out in Ralah. CHAPTER VIL THE ARRIVAL. It Was in the afternoon of the fouith day of Mareh, in the year of Christ one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one. The steamer from Albany bad just landed her passengers on the long pier that stretches from the edge of the shore at the foot of Courtland-street, out into the North River. It was one of those cold, bitter days, when the poor of God's creatures crawl shivering into holes and corners to escape the biting pangs of the raging blast, and pray that they may die ; it was one of those days in rude and gusty March, when the rich man buttons his coat mercilessly to the poor, that a single spark of pitying charity may not enter his iron soul, and thanks his stars for having pro- vided him with means to defy the raging storm ; it was one of those cold, merci- less days, when God's enemy stalks rampant through the world, whispering into the ears of the wretched poor \u2014 \" Why serve you Him ? Mark, how he lashes you with his biting winds, because ye are poor and friendless, and garmentless, and homeless ! Against the rich, these hoarse, raging blasts, are things of sport and mockery : for, lo ! they are clothed, and housed, and warmed by glowing fires. But you \u2014 poor miserable wretches\u2014 against ye they are directed, for ye alone can feel their scourging powers I\" It was on such a day as this when, after numerous difficulties, the Albany steamer landed her passengers on the pier. And, as ever, the poor were there to serve the sons of wealth ; to screen them from the pinching cold, and bear them to buildings where warm, cheery fires, laughingly drive out the angry, sweeping cold. Among the foremost of the passengers that landed upon the pier, was a young man, whose appearance and dress saved him from the attacks and solicitations of the numerous hackmen, porteis and boys crowding the pier in search of fare and jobs. As he passed and elbowed his way through the congiegated mass, not a hand offered to take charge of his baggage, not one haskman inyitcd him to hie carriage."], [46, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 38 This will not be wondered at, when we mention this one fact, his dress announced him one frowned on by fortune. Tall and slender, he seemed doubly so by the seediness of his black dress coat, which, fitting him close about the waist, was buttoned up to the throat, His loose-fitting trowsers reached scarcely to his feet, and his boots were thin and well-worn at the heels. His low, bell-crowned, narrow-brimmed hat had evidently been long in service, for scarcely a remnant of the nap was to be seen. Around his throat was wound a black silk neckerchief, the short ends meeting in front in a small narrow tie. In his hand he carried a small, square trunk, about twelve inches long, nine in width, five or six in depth, and covered with Russia leather. The features of this young man were at once striking and classic. His forehead was high, broad and massive ; his brows arching, and black as jet ; his dark eyes small, glistening and perfectly shaped ; his nose sharp, thin, and straight ; his lips small, beautifully carved, and indicative of unflinching firmness, strong sensibility, and unwavering tenacity ; his chin was rounded to a delicate point. His complexion was that of a native of the southern isles. He walked coolly up the street, as if the cold winds were not raving around him, and biting into his bones. With that small trunk in his right hand, he walked steadily on till he reached Broadway. Then turning to the left, he pur sued his course, with the same steady gait, till he came to Read-street. Then turning down that narrow pave, he walked on till his eye encountered \" Boarding\" on the green door of a small, two-story brick building, situated nearly midway between the great thoroughfare of Broadway and Church-street. '' This is the place,\" he muttered ; and seizing the knocker, he gave three loud raps on the door. The summons was answered by a tall, sharp-featured female, upon whose face time had marked the furrows of old age. \" Can I have board here ?\" asked the stranger. \"If you wish it,\" answered the sharp- featured woman. \" Your terms ?\" The female scanned him for a moment with her keen, grey, hungry eye, and answered, \u2014 \" Two dollars and a half a week.1' '* I wish a room all to myself.\" \" In that case, the terms will be three dollars and a half,\" said the female, with a supercilious glance. \"I willj>ay it,\" said the young man. \"I wish immediate possession.\" \" Walk in,\" said the female, \" and you shall have it in a few minutes.\" The stranger entered, and was shown into a middling-sized apartment, looking out upon the street. This was the sitting-room, and \u2014 as a tell-tale sofa bedstead between the door and window plainly told \u2014 sleeping-room. A coarse, cheap, ingrain carpet covered the floor ; while two long tables, spread close together, stood in the centre ot the room. \" We have a week in advance from strangers,\" said the sharp-featured woman, with that peculiarly cool air so common among females of her stamp in the great metropolis. '\u2022' We always make it a rule to demand it from strangers,\" .she added. \" On the principle that rogues always suspect others to be no better than themselves,\" said the young man, carelessly, and laying his small trunk on a chair. \" I do not wish to be insulted, sir,\" returned the female, drawing herself up \u2022\u25a0' I suppose not,\" remarked the young man, carelessly. \" How much did you say ?\" ' \"Three dollars and a half,\" 9aid the female. \"There is your money,\" said the young man, handing her a piece of paper which he had taken from his pocket-book. \" This is not money,\" returned the sharp-faced woman, hastily."], [47, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 39 \" Will you dishonour it?\" said the young man, coolly. \" You had better read it first.'\" \"You are insolent, sir,\" exclaimed the sharp-faced female with a frown. \" It may be so,\" answered the young man, carelessly ; \" for I have been in the company of hounds for the last two months : and I find that the more one lashes them, the faster they learn civility.\" \" Do you mean to apply your remarks to me, sir V demanded the female, tartly. \" I refuse to answer the question ; if you choose, I give you liberty to apply them as you please.\" The sharp-faced female bit her lips, unable to reply. \" Yr,u will oblige me by wasting no more time,\" continued the young man, coolly ; \" read that paper and inform me whether it will answer you as well as money ?\" The female coloured, and, biting her lips, cast her eyes upon the paper. The document was laconic, but enough to cause her blushing features to assume the hue of snow : \u2014 \" The bearer wishes board, and a room to himself. He can find both at your house, so long as he needs them. You will tieat him with every indulgence and i espect, if you would not make me your enemy. John Griffin.\" These words, whatever they alluded to, were sufficient to create an entire change in the manner of the female. \" You shall have what you want, and this note is equivalent to money,\" said she, with marked suavity. \" I will see that your room is forthwith prepared.\" \" I thought you would,\" said the young man, coolly. The young man now approached the grate, in which, according to boarding house custom, a few coals were struggling with might and main to present the appearance of a fire. In a few moments the sharp-faced woman returned, and informed the stranger that his room was ready. \" What shall I have the pleasure of calling you ?\" said she. \" You may call me what you please, but my name is Rule Ruby,\" answered the young man, following her. \" Mine is Mrs. Harvey,\" said the sharp-faced female, as she led the way to a small room over the ball, on the second floor. \" I saw it on the paper,\" remarked the young man, carelessly. \" This room has got a cot-bed, one chair, a wash-stand and a rag carpet in it only,\" he added, looking around. \" Where is the table ?\" \"What table, sir?\" \"The table that stood here five minutes ago, madam,'\" said the young man, sternly. \" There has never been any table in this room, sir,\" said Mrs. Harvey, with some asperity. \" Allow me to inform you, madam, that your education, if you ever had any, has been thrown away upon you : for you have forgotten that in the march of life, truth is far more politic than falsehood,\" said the young man, in a tone that made the sharp-featured female tremble. \" Look there, Airs. Harvey 1\" And he pointed to the square spots, now surrounded with dust, where the four legs of a table had recently stood. The sharp-faced woman winced under the indignant look of the young man. Nevertheless, she again endeavoured to breast it out, when she was cut short by the other. \" Lie not, madam, in small matters. It is bad enough to perpetrate falsehood in cases of importance. Go and bring me a table.\" Awed and startled by his manner, the boarding-house woman left the room and presently returned with a small maple table."], [48, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 40 The young man eyed the legs of the latter a moment ; then taking it up, he placed them with unerring judgment on the marks he had pointed out. \" You see they fit to a hair,\" he added, maliciously. The sharp-featured woman dropped her eyes in confusion. \" I want a lamp\u2014 one capable of lasting six hours, if need be \u2014 placed on this table every night, while I am taking my tea,\" continued the young man ; \" at that time your servant will come to me, and take my key. Do you understand me, madam ?\" \" You intend to keep your room locked, Mr. Ruby ?\" \" Yes, madam ; every morning, while I am at breakfast, your servant will make up my bed, and clean up my room, and when she is done, return me the key. Do you understand, madam ?\" \"Yes, sir,\" stammered Mrs. Harvey, biting her lip. \" You will oblige me by quitting this room,, and sending or bringing me a lamp, Mrs. Harvey, for it is now getting quite dark,\" continued the young maD, impera tively. The boarding-house woman left the apartment without uttering a word ; but her manner was that of one writhing under the sting of a serpent. She returned in a few minutes with a lighted lamp, of an ordinary size, and placed it on the table. \" Anything else, Mr. Ruby V she inquired in a quiet tone of sarcasm. \" The key of the room,\" said the young man, coolly. \" 'Tis in the door, sir. Anything else 1\" \"When the hour for supper arrives, come up and inform me,\" said the young man, with astonishing pertinacity. \" I will send up the servant,\" observed the boarding-house woman. \" Nay, you will come up yourself,\" said the young man, in a voice that made her shudder. Mrs. Harvey crept from the room as if stung by an adder. When alone, the young man closed and locked the door. Then taking up his small trunk and laying it on the table, he touched a spring, when it flew open, re vealing, instead of the inside of the trunk, a perfect writing case. Raising one end of the lid, he drew forth pen, ink, and paper. the latter before him, he wrote these word \u2014 \" 4th day of the 3d month, '31. \" I am at Mrs. H.'s house in Read-street, New York. I have been in the city about forty minutes. I followed the north-western route*per order, and left my two companions frozen dead upon the road about two miles this side of Niagara. Consequently, I am alone. I am now ready.\" This laconic letter signatured with the strange and startling sac-simile of a dagger, he folded and superscribed thus : \u2014 \" PHILADELPHIA, 17.\" CHAPTER II THE ATTORNEY. The next day, about an hour before noon, a young man, dressed in the extreme of fashion, was seen walking down Wall-street, with a regular but nervous gait, as if some matter of vital importance were preying on bis mind. It was a bitter cold morning ; and, though protected from the cutting winds, by"], [49, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 41 garments at once showy, costly, and of the most comfortable texture, the young man muttered many au impatient \" dem it,\" as he proceeded down the street. \" There goes dandy Marxley,'' whispered a young broker to a companion, as the young man passed him. \" Something is in tho wind to drag him out so early.\" \" You don't call this hour early,\" said the other, with a laugh. \" Not for men of business,\" answered the broker. \" But for dandy Mr. M., it 16 extraordinary. He generally goes to bed at day-light, and rises at dark. Of course you have heard of him ?\" \" I have not had that pleasure.\" \" He is the most consummate fop in town ; carries more brass than nineteen lawyers, thirty constables, and twenty magistrates ; is a perfect Chesterfield in his own opinion, and a perfect clown in that of every one else ; says more nothings in twenty-four hours than all the spoonies in the world beside ; has ruined, according No, 6."], [50, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 42 to his own account, more women than the world ever saw, and destroys more kids and broadcloth than all the bumpkins of the town put together.\" \"Does he pay his bills ?'' \" That is a question I cannot answer, as I have never had the pleasure of measur ing his coat, or of acting as book-keeper to his tailor.\" \" He has travelled, of course ?\" \" It is so said, though with what truth I know not.\" \" Does he pretend to be a man of honour ?\" \" He pretends to a great deal, but of his honour I have never heard. He fired at and wounded a poor, unarmed milkman once. That is the extent of his pluck, I believe.\" \" He must be a quneer creature ! See \u2014 he is going into the Squills Buildings.\" \" Then he is going to his lawyer's \u2014 Mischief is brewing, or he wouldn't be seen in Wall street, particularly in business hours.\" \" He don't relish business ?\" \"He? The very name of business shocks him \u2014 * it is so demd vulgaw,' \" added the broker, with laughing mimicry. \" But let us to the hall \u2014 the Board is about to open !\" And, ascending the long stone steps, the young brokers entered the vast hall of the Exchange. Meanwhile.the young dandy had proceeded down the street, till he came to a brick building of some five stories, around the entrance of which was a multitude of small tin signs, denoting the names of the greedy sharks, whose \" chambers\" were ready for the reception of such victims as were anxious to purchase their services or opinions. Ascending two flights of stairs, the young dandy came to a door in the rear part of the building, on which was fastened a small, half-faded tin plate with this simple announcement : \u2014 \"JOHN GRIFFIN, ATTORNEY.\" \"Dem it \u2014 here 'tisat last \u2014 demit!\" \u2014 muttered the dandy, his eyes sparkling as if at same great discovery. \"But the dem'd horwible handle !\" he exclaimed, as he beheld the knob, that looked as if stained by time and want of use. \" If I touch the dem'd thing, my bewful kids will be wuined sow ever ! I'll knock, and make 'em open \u2014 dem it !\" And raising his long, black, slender cane he tappe 1 the door gently, like one trying the hardness of raw egg without wishing to break it. The noise, however, was too gentle, and the young dandy was compelled to essay another. But this attempt, being no louder than its predecessor, was sdso abortive- \" Dem it '.\" muttered the dandy, impatiently ; \"the fellows must positively be deaf!\" And bracing his nerves for another and mightier effort, he commenced a series of low taps, that sounded to those within like the faint beatings of a distant drum. \" Come in ,\" growled a voice that made the dandy shudder, \"That's his demd'd voice!\" muttered tha latter. \"Why don't he open the dem'd door ? I shall ketch my death here in this horwible draft\u2014 I'm sure of it\u2014 dem it !\" And again he played a low tattoo upon the left panel. To his infinite delight the dandy now heard steps approaching, The next moment, the door suddenly opened, aud a small, tin, sandy-haired, hazelleyed, pock-pitted man confronted the delicate visitor. \" Ha! Maixley\u2014 is't you ?\" said the man, opening the door, so as to admit the dandy. \" Why didn't you come in at oncc:'\" \" The handle would have soiled my kids, Gwiffin, my dear fellow .\"' answered Marxley, entering with extreme cautiousness, so that the skirt of his buff overcoat \u00abhonld not touch the stern-looking knob, \" Take a chair,\" said the attorney, with a bland smile, that gave his pock-uitted features a moss revolting expression. ' v"], [51, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 43 It was a room of middling size, containing two desks, some chairs, a screen and five shelves of time-stained, well thumbed law books. Opposite the book-shelves, a grate showed a rosy, cheery face, and glowed with a low moan, as its draft rushed, in a steady current, up the narrow chimney. Two windows looked out upon the yard, now fulled with ice and snow. Placing a chair a few feet from that of his visitor, the attorney seated himself so as to fix his eyes, like a battery, straight on those of the dandy. The latter look off his small, bright, narrow-brimmed castor, and resting it on the top of his long, slender cane, observed \u2014 \"This dem'd Burloch, Gwiffin\u2014 what is it?\" \" What is what?\" said the attorney, calmly, and fixed his small, hazel-eyes on the wondering ones of his visitor, \" You know well enough, Gwiffin \u2014 dem it! Burloch \u2014 \" \" What of him 1\" said the attorney, without moving a muscle. \" What of him ?\" repeated the dandy, impatiently. \" Dem it j enough of him ! I very much wish to know if he is wesolved on carrying through his horwible design ?\" \" Ah !\" said the attorney, drily. \" Of course you can tell me all about it, G.viffin ?\" said Marxley, earnestly. \" What should I tell you ?\" said the atton.ey. \" Dem if, Gwiffin, that is outwageous !\" exclaimed the dandy, whirling his hat and cane with astonishing rapidity. '' I never heard enny thing appwoximating to it in the slightest degwie. Dem it !\" A slight smile hung for a moment on the fipg of the attorney, and then his fea tures resumed their usual calm, expressionless aspect. \" You do not answer me, Gwiffin !\" continued the dandy, still whirling his hat. \" If you will tell me what to say, I will say it, said the attorney, calmly. \" Oh, the cautiousness of you men of business 1\" exclaimed Marxley ; \" you dare not hazard an opinhun or thwow away a word, lest you bwin yourselves into twou ble. Dem ! I wouldn't be a business man for the world I\" \" I suppose not,\" said the attorney, drily. \" Positively I would not !\" continued the dandy, surveying with fond pride the matchless polish of his faultless castor.^\" But this howible Burloch, \u2014 this wetched fellow who thweatens our peace so, Gwiffin. He positively annoys me !\" \" Indeed!\" said the attorney, calmly. \" Yes ; dem it !\" exclaimed Marxley, petulantly. \"Can't something be done with him Gwiffin ?\" \" I never deliver an opinion without a fee, Mr. Marxley,\" said the attorney, phlegmatically. \" But, dem it, Gwiffin ! can't you talk upon a matter without\u2014\" \"A fee ?\" interrupted the lawyer, drily. \" No, Mr. Marxley, I am a business man ; talking consumes time, and, with men of business, time is money.'' '' Dem it !\" exclaimed the dandy, petulan !y. and drawing forth a richly wrought purse. \"How much for your opinion, Gw i ?' \" Ten dollars,\" said the attorney,\" calml; \" Gwacious !\"cried Marxley; \" you don't mean it.\" \" I am very busy, Mr. Marxley,\" said the a.torney, rising ; \" if you have nothing of any importance to say, I shall return to my desk !\" \"Nay, keep your seat, Gwiffin, my dear fellow,\" sad the dandy, hastily; \"I wish your opinion, and here is your fee.\" The attorney took the money, and resumed his chair. \"Well?\" said he^ calmly. \" Can't something be done with him, Gwiffin ?\" \" With Burloch ?\" \" With him,\" said the dandy, earnestly. \" In regard to the measures he has already taken?\" \" Yes, Gwiffin.\""], [52, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 44 \" He has not yet committed himself,\" said the lawyer, calmly. \" And nothing can be done with him ?\" \" No sir.\" \" But if he persists in his course, Gwiffin ?\" continued the dandy, anxiously. \" 'Tis all the same,\" said the lawyer, calmly. The exquisite turned pale. \" Dem it I\" he muttered ; \" to pay the enormous sum of ten dollars, and yet get no consolation ! Demnition ! What will my mother say !\" And in his rage, the discomfited dandy applied his thumb and forefinger to his right moustache, and violently wrenched out a single hair. The next moment, however, he repented of the act, and consternation was depicted in his features. \" The matter, now ?\" said the attorney, who had been watching him with im perturbable gravity. ./.-,\u00ab \" That makes the third I have wobbed my poor wight moustache of to-day, replied the dandy, in a voice of the most indescribable misery. \" Indeed !\" said the attorney, phlegmatieally. \" Yes, Gwiffin\u2014 isn't it horwible ?\" \" Very,\" returned the attorney, drily. \" The left has three more hairs than the wight ! Is it perceptible, Gwiffin ?\" he added, bending his face earnestly towards the lawyer. \" I can't perceive any difference,\" said the latter, with features as inflexible as marble. \" Yesterday,\" continued the exquisite, \"there were just sixty-one hairs on each tide ; and now \u2014 dem it 1\" And the unhappy Marxley wiped away a tear. .\" Well V said the attorney, gravely, when sufficient time had passed for the exquisite's indulgence in his grief. \" Well ?\u25a0' The dandy looked up. \" We were talking of Burloch,\" said the attorney, for the purpose of refreshing his memory. \" He had the horwible impertinence to write me yesterday,\" said the exqeisite. \"Well?\" \" He offers to welin^uish all further pwoceedings, if I will pay him down a certain sum of money.\" \" What sum does he demand I\" said the attorney. \" Twelve thousand dollars.\" \" Well?\" said Griffin, without changing a muscle of his rigid features. \" Did you ever hear of such horwible assurance, Gwiffin ?\" \" Your answer,* said the attorney, calmly, without noticing the question. \" I wrote him that I would give him eight,\" said Marxley, colouring. \" Eight what V said the attorney, hastily. \" Eight thousand,\u2014 tbat was enough \u2014 don't you think so, Gwiffin ?\" said the exquisite, trembling \u2014 though he knew not why \u2014 in spite of himself. The iron features of the attorney now unbent, and were fixed upon the young dandy with an expression of astonishment and withering scorn. \" Are you in earnest ?\" said Gwiffin, in a voice that startled his **i\u00abtor. \" Of course, Gwiffin. Why I\" said the young man, without raising his eyes. \" Did you send your reply by special messenger or by post ?\" said the attorney, in a severe tone. ''By post. But, good gwacious, Gwiffin ! what'* the matter? You are as white as a sheet 1* \" No matter,\" said the attorney, quickly. \" Run with all your might to the post-office, and get that letter ! Everything depends upon it !\" \"Ah \u2014 ah \u2014 explain, Gwiffin!\" said the exquisite, alarmed at his vehemence. \" Pon honour, I * \"That letter,\" replied the attorney, with startling emphasis, \"is a tacit ac knowledgment of the weaknect and instability of your claims to your property."], [53, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 45 In Burloch 's cunning hands it will be a weapon that will annihilate our whole cause. Run ! fly ! and regain that letter !\" \"But, my dear fellow,\" continued the dandy, coolly, v I don't like your mode of speaking. I don't like to be ordered. And I will not stir an inch until you hev explained in full what you mean by ennihilating our whole cause. If I do, dem me !\" \"Our cause!\" exclaimed Griffin, surveying him sternly. \"Do you not know, sir, that the holders of the vast Langton estate have formed an alliance for mutual protection from this rapacious Burloch ?\" \"Well, my dear fellow ?\" said the dandy, calmly. \" That they met his offers with scorn and defiance V continued the aroused attorney. \" Well ?\" said the dandy, with provoking calmness. \" Well ?\" repeated the attorney, ironically , \" and do you not now see the folly of the answer you have made to this Burloch? Do yon not^now see how it can be turned against us? Do you not now see the folly of \"answering him at all without consulting me ?\" added the excited attorney. \" Positively, no !'\" replied the exquisite, coolly. \" You hev pwoceeded in this dem'd elliance without censulting or advising me in enny of its stages down to the present hour. I hev been tweated as a mere cipher in the whole matter, when it is extwemely well known that I hold more of this dem'd pwoperty then enny two in the whole elliance !'' The lawyer was astonished at the strength of character evinced by one whom he had always looked upon \u2014 as the exquisite had truly expressed it \u2014 as a mere cipher ; and his mercurial mind saw at once the necessity of treating him, and also of having him so treated by the alliance, as one whose opinions were at least worthy of apparent respect. Changing his stern manner, he resumed his seat, and re plied in a bland, honeyed voice,\u2014 \" My dear Marxley, your observations are perfectly correct, and I am grieved \u2014 deeply grieved \u2014 that the alliance have acted heretofore without making you one of their counsel. As it is, however, and since the past cannot be recalled, your well-known good sense will at once inform you that it is useless to waste words about it now. But in future, my dear Marxley, nothing shall be done without your knowledge and approval. John Griffin pledges you his word for that !\" This well-timed flattery acted like a charm upon the weak brain of the exqui site, and brought him at once \u2014 as the wily attorney intended it should \u2014 under the passive influence of the keen-eyed lawyer. \" Ah, well \u2014 I'm perfectly satisfied, Griffin. A swank apology always disarms me of my anger. I don't keer about heving enny thing to do with the elliance \u2014 that is, actively. I abhor ennything that requires watchfulness or ection. All I keer about is, to know how the cause pwoceeds : for this Burloch is a dem'd wicked, cunning, reckless, impertinent fellow. He gives me a deal of anxiety \u2014 he does, 'pon honour. I shall never again know rest until I hear of his defeat \u2014 dem him !\" \" But the letter?\" said the attorney, anxiously. \" I'll go to the dem'd post immediately \u2014 you know it is only across the way there, in the Exchange, and see if I ken get it.\" Saying which, Marxley arose, and, after carefully adjusting his hat on his well-formed head, proceeded towards the door. \" Oh, Gwiffin,\" said he, pausing. \" Well ?\" said the impatient lawyer. \" If I succeed in getting the dem'd letter, I shall return \u2014 if not, you needn't ex pect he : for I hev business at home which wequires my immediate ettention \u2014 in which case, Gwiffin, I shall bid you \u2014 \" \"Good day !'' said the attorney, with a slight sneer \" Au revoir '.\"added the exquisite. The lawyer's features settled into a deep frown when the door had closed upon his visitor.\" \" If he get it not I\" he muttered through his grating teeth, \" he has put"], [54, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 46 back the dial of our cause a good long year. Curse his absurd folly ! Hazard !\" he added, turning toward the screen. *' I'm on hand,\" returned a loud, coarse, careless voice. \"Come out,\" said the attorney, 'we are now alone.\" A heavy step was heard, and the next moment, a tall, stout man, wrapped in a low crowned fur cap, a long, soiled, drab overcoat, with large, flash buttons, coarse satinet trowsers, aud large thick boots, came out from behind the screen, with a careless, jaunting step, and flung himself on the chair previously occupied by the young hair-brained exquisite. There was something in the features of this mau that told at once of the dare devil and the ruffian. On resuming his seat, he \u2014 out on that innate awe, perhaps, which rough minds ever feel when in the presence of one noted for the keenness of his intellect \u2014 took off his cap, and disclosed a mode rately-sized forehead, and a head of thick, sandy hair inclining to curliness; his eyes, ef a deep hazel, were bright and piercing, and shaded with light, arching, sandy brows, expressive of low cunning, quickness of perception, and a large share of animal courage ; his nose was long and thick, and his thick lips, evincives of love of dissipation, inordinate sluggishness and stern ferocity. The lawyer seated himself close to the man, and bent his small, fox-like eyes upon him, as if to test their power upon the ruffian. \" And so, Hazard,\" began the attorney, in the tone of one who condescends to speak to an inferior, \" you have not accomplished it ?\" \" Not yet,\" said Hazard, huskily. \" The fact is, sir, it arn't so easy as it looks. \u2014 These consumptive fellers hang on like old grandmothers. There ain't no killin 'cm off, afore their time, no how.\" \"But what have you done so far. Hazard?\" said the lawyer, playing with his tooth-pick, as if the subject of their consultation were of trifling importance >nly. *' Why, as to that, sir.\" said the ruffian, with a low laugh, '\u25a0 I think I've done putty well. You know the house in which they live, is a rickety old consarn, having as many families in it as the old brewery in Cross street.\" \" Well ?\" said the lawyer. \"Well,\" pursued the ruffian, \" findin that it was a difficult matter to finish the old feller in the or'nary way, I made a conspection \u2014 \" \"An inspection you mean ?\" interrupted the attorney. \"Well, it's all the same in meanin, though some folks call it differently from others,\" said the ruffian, somewhat abashed. \" Aa I was sayin', seein' things didn't work right in the or'nary way, I made an inspection of the premises to see what could be done. I saw a bill on the wall a-side of the door, statin' that a room was to let, and I made bold to inquire on which floor it was, the rent, and so on.\" \u2022\u2022Well?\" \" The room was on the same story okkerpied by the Mansfields, which I was glad to find, and the rent only a dollar a week. Thinkin' yer wouldn't mind a-payin' thats mall sum in consideration of the advantage it would give us for \u2014 \" \" Stop!\" said the attorney, sharply. Hazard raised his eyes in surprise. \" You must not, under any circumstances, connector speak of me in this mat- ter. I pay you for doing a service\u2014 the means you employ are none of my busi- ness ; they are your own affair : and I am not responsible. Whatever items yok choose to add to your bill, add \u2014 all shall be paid ; but don't speak of me. Do you understand?\" And he fixed his keen, glittering eyes full on those of the ruffian. The latter strove for a few moments to withstand that piercing gaze ; finding the effort vain, however, a blush crept over his hard, brazen cheek, and dropping his eyes and turning them towards the fire, he answered, in a voice husky with fear and passion\u2014 \" Certainly, Mr. Griffin., certainly. It was a mere slip of the tongue, for which I asK pardon.\" \".Enough\" said the lawyer, calmly, \" go on.\" *' W ell, as I wai sayin,\" added Hazard, \" considerin' that a dollar a week was a mere flea-bite, I took the room for me and Tib\u2014\""], [55, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 47 \" Who's Tib ?\" interrupted the attorney. \" Tib \u2014 mother Tib; of course yer know her !\" \" I have not that Honour,\" said the attorney, drily. \" Tib is the mother of us Owlers ; she's a reg'lar rip wheu she's roused, and in fight is good for any six of us. She can lick any six of the gang, as easily as shake her finger,\" \" Astonishing !\" remarked the attorney. \" Yes, she's dispassin' astonishin' ! you never see her like, nor nobody else. If it warn't for her, we couldn't a-hold together no how : we'd soon break up, or get nab bed. But Tib keeps us all as straight as a knife, and as sharp, too. She's a screamed is Tib, IteT you!\" \". A very lucid explanation !\" said the attorney. \"I thought I'd soon make yer apprehend her,\" added the Owler, with a slight chuckle of triumph, \" cause yer see such a character as Tib's is easily apprehen ded !\" \" Doubtless !\" said the attorney, with a dry smell. \" Well ?'' \" Well, as 1 was sayin', 1 took the room for me and Tib, the better to carry on our plan, and moved our traps there that very day, 'cause, you see, me and Tib is man and wife, out of feller feelin' like, and for mutual 'vantage. Tib allers sides with me, bein' cap'n, afore the Owlers, and I always side with her when she and any of the gang is at loggerheads ; this gives weight and strength to both on us, which is highly dissential to union and harmony.\" \" To the point,\" said the attorney, impatiently. \" That's what I'm comin' to,\" continued the ruffian. \". As I was sayin', we moved our traps, and took possession of the room. Not to be in the way I go outevery day, as if I was goin' to work, leaving Tib to do the agreeable neigh bour with the Mansfields ; of course, she and them gets acquainted, and Tib, as a matter o' course, soon hears of the old sick daddy ; of course, she is very neigh bourly, and makes him drinks, and helps, 'casion ally, to make his bed, and when Marian is Used up with care and weeping, offers to and does sit up with the old man, to give him his drinks atstated times, as prescribed by thedoctor,\" he added, with a low chuckle. \" How long is it since you and Tib moved there?\" \" About six weeks,'' answered the Owler. \" But if Tib has been a good neighbour so long a time,'' said the attorney, \" how comes it old Mansfield is yet alive ?\" he asked in a low stern whisper. \" She does all she can, considerin' the circumstances,\" said the hardened ruffian, 3omewhat abashed. \" She does her best in mixin' the drinks as they hadn't ought to be mixed, and has even gone so far, when all were asleep, as to put some of Fran zoni's mixtures in with the medicines, for the sake of hurrin' the old feller off. But it takes time for the mixtures to work, so as to leave no suspicious marks. Coroners are mighty partickler, and it gives even Franzoni's drops trouble enough to blind 'em.\" \" How do they live.\" '\u25a0 Like poor people \u2014 like very poor people.\" *' I mean where do they get their money ?\" \" Marian sews vests and trowsers\u2014 she's graat on vests. She's very smart on 'em \u2014 makes one a day, and gets a dollar a piece for 'em, as Tib tells me.\" \" Then she earns six dollars a week ?\" said the lawyer musingly. \" Something in that neighbor'ood, I believe,\" said the Owler, somewhat abashed : ': I aint of much account at cipherin' myself.\" \" They ought to live well on a sum like that,\" remarked the attorney. \" They ought, but they don't,\" replied the ruffian. 5! Its the port and the grapes as does it.\" \" The poit and the grapes ?\" \" Yes \u2014 the port and the grapes.\" \" What do you mean ?\" said the lawyer. \"Why you see, the doctor says unless Mansfield has a pint of generwine port"], [56, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 48 every day to nurse him, and half-a-pound of grapes to invigorate him, he cant live. Well, as Marian is so deeply devoted to her father, of course four out of the six dollars she arns every week, goes to paying for the wine and grapes and med'cines. On the other two dollars, the family has to live and wittle themselves.\" \" And pay rent,\" suggested the attorney. \"And pay rent,\" added the Owler. The attorney was thoughtful a few moments. , \" Might it not be the wine and grapes that counteract the effects ot the mix tures ?' \" \" It might\u2014 there's no tellin',\" said the Owler, sagely. \" If the old man were kept from his wine and grapes, he would soon be on his winding way ?\" suggeseted the villanous attorney, lowering his voice to a whisper. \" I think it likely,\" returned the Owler, catching at the idea and winking. g\" Could Tib not do it!\" said the lawyer. \u00ab ?\" said the Owler, catching Griffin's eye. \" Tib,\" repeated the attorney, in a low meaning whisper. \" If yer would but give me an idee ?\" said the Owler, edging his chair closer to the lawyer's. \" Do you ever read V said the attorney, calmly. \" Seldom,\" answered the Owler. \" I wasn't brought up to much larnin; and it's not so easy to do anything that one arn't got no inclination for. I seldom read anything but the comick almanack and the papers.\" \" Why do you read the papers ?\" \"Jest to see who has |been pulled. It's a pleasure to know the progress ef one's 'quaintances ; so I allers read the police reports. But why do you ask the question ?\" \" There is a book \u2014 though I cannot now call to mind its name \u2014 written ex pressly for persons in straits and difficulties, so filled with ideas and suggestions, you cannot conceive a single difficulty that it has not a remedy ,to surmount or sweep aside.\" \"It must be a\u00bbgreat book,\" said the Owler, understanding him. \" It is a work of extraordinary merit,'' continued the attorney ; \" and it abounds with expedients for removing every possible difficulty. One passage in it I parti culularly remember, simply because it bears upon the strait which you are now in. It runs thus \u2014 ' When one that you hate stands on the right side of prosperity, de stroy the means by which he sustains himself, and you have him at your mercy.' If you had that book, Hazard, you might read it all your life, and not find any thing more apropos in a case like this.'' \" I understand,' said the Owler, significantly. \" If Marian's work should be stole by somebody, she would have to make the vally of it up \u2014 which of course she couldn't do \u2014 afore she got any more work. Isn't that it ?\" \" I wish to make no suggestions to you in regard to your business,\" said the attorney haughtily. \" You can do as you please in regard to matters concerning yourself alone. I should be sorry to see you fail for your own sake, as it would be productive of mueh woe to you !\" he added ina tone so significant that the other could not fail to understand it \"I shall not fail !\" replied the Owler, with startling emphasis. \" When you have accomplished the work in hand,\" continued the attorney \"call and let me know.\" \" I will,\" said the ruffian, taking the observation\u2014 as it was meant \u2014 for a hint to take his departure. \" And finish it as soon as possible, Hazard,\" added the attorney, patronizingly ; \" for I have another job in tow for you. D'ye hear, Hazard ?\" \"Yes,\" said the ruffian. \" In a week or Jess, you shall hear from me.

Having written thus far, the attorney looked it over with a smile that would have distorted even the features of a fiend. He then closed the diary, and replaced it in the desk. Having carefully locked the latter, he pocketed the key, and then approached and seated himself by the fire. \" In the great contest of life,\" he muttered, \"all means are holy, if they are successful.\" CHAPTER III. THE CLERK. The morning fellowing the day when took place the incidents described in the preceding chapter, the young stranger, whose arrival in the city of New York was related m the first chapter of the present book, rose early, and, after washing' and"], [59, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 51 preparing himself, descended to breakfast. Meeting Hetty, the onlv servant, as he turned the stairs and entered the hall, he gave her his key, and, in the tone of one expecting to be obeyed, bade her go immediately and make up his room ; warning her at the same time to return him his key at the expiration of his breakfast. Hetty \u2014 having previously received her instructions from her mistress \u2014 hastened to obey, and, as she ascended the stairs, the yonng man entered the sitting-room, which, as we have already stated, served for the triple purpose of dining-room, parlour, and bed-chamber. The table was spread, and around it were gathered some ten or twelve persons, of various ages, eating their meal in hurriedness and silence. Like a presiding deity, Mrs. Harvey sat at the head of the table, her right hand grasping, as grasps a king his sceptre, the handle of a stout, smoky, coffee-pot ; while at her left, rose a small tower of cups and saucers, together with those equally indispen. sable articles, an unhappy-looking sugar bowl and a dandy milk cup, with a broken mouth. As Rule Ruby cast his eyes over the length and breadth of the table, and beheld nothing but a few plates of small, fried potatoes, a plate or two of sliced beef, and one or two plates of bread sliced to the thinness of a wafer, he marvelled where the twelve around the table found enough to set their teeth in motion. \" What shall I have the pleasure of helping you to, Mr. Ruby V inquired Mrs. Harvey, in a voice of maternal solicitude. \" If it would be a pleasure for you to help me to anything, Mrs. Harvey, you must first go and bring it into this room ; for I see nothing on the table,\" was the cool reply. The boarders looked np in astonishment at the audacity of the stranger. Two or three ventured to grin \u2014 others looked grave ; but one little man \u2014 evidently a new comer \u2014 laughed outright, and said, while the tears ran down his jolly cheeks, \u2014 \" Bravo ! bravo ! Ver good ! ver good !\" His tone betokened him a son of France. Mrs. Harvey blushed indignantly, and bit her lips with savage fury. Neverthe- less she persisted in helping him to something. \" Fortunately for you, Mrs. Harvey,\" said Rule Ruby, seating himself near her, \" I have no appetite this morning ; so you may help me to a cup of coflee.\" \"Strong or weak, Mr. Ruby?\" \" I care not whether it be strong or weak, Mrs. Harvey, so long as it have the flavour of coffee,\" returned the young man. Mrs. Harvey bit her lips majestically, after the most approved manner of board- ing-house keepers, and then handed him a small cup of boarding-house coffee. \" What do you call this?\" said Rule Ruby, after having tasted the liquid. \"Coffee, sir,\" was the remarkable reply. \" Have you any conscience, Mrs. Harvey ?\" said the young man, putting down his cup. \" What do you mean, sir ?\" said the boarding-house keeper, with boarding-house majesty. \" I mean, madam,'' returned the young man, fixing his small, dark, piercing eyes on her, \" that your conscience must be exceedingly elastic, when you endea- vour to palm offa decoction of rank weeds for drinkable coffee.\" The boarders looked at the stranger and then at each other in amazement. The little Frenchman alone gave utterance to his feelings. \"Ha! ha!\" he exclaimed, rubbing his small, chubby hands; \"ver good\u2014 ver good! Rank veeds \u2014 ha! ha! so 'tis! Such coffee \u2014 bah!\" Mrs. Harvey looked daggers at the Frenchman Then turning to the stranger, she said, with offended pride \u2014 \" If you do not like the coffee, Mr. Ruby, you \u2014 \" \" I am very fond of coflee, Mrs. Harvey,\" interrupted Rule Ruby, \" but I have \u2022no regard for rank weed-water. Oblige me by procuring me a cup of coflee in- stantly, madam !\" Mrs. Harvey rose from the table and left the room, to thej surprise of her boarders,"], [60, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 52 who, till now, had been accustomed to pay her the most implicit obedience. and take what she gave them, whether much or little, good, bad or indifferent, without a murmur or a word. Nor could they account for the imperious manner )f the new boarder, or the passive obedience of Mrs. Harvey to his commands. They were dumb -founded ; for they knew by long experience the stem, severe lisposition of the boarding-house keeper. Many and meaning were the glances they flung, too, at the little Frenchman, for his temerity in countenancing the attack of the stranger on the wretched fare of Mrs. Harvey's table. But the little French man was not one to submit in silence to the chains imposed on boarders when he could not find a leader to \" speak out.\" He had \" said his say,\" and perhaps, on tbat very account, Mrs. Harvey would henceforth treat him with decency. At all events, he resolved henceforth to watch the hour when the stranger came to his meals, that the landlady should have no opportunity to slight or to call him to an account for his levity in speaking out. \" Here is some mocha, that I keep for my sick boarders,\" said Mrs. Harvey, who had re-entered and taken her seat. \" See if that will please your lordly palate!'' she added. \"This will do, madam,\" said Rule Ruby, with a look of satisfaction. \" If this is what you reserve for your sick boarders, you will please to remember tbat I am always sick enough to prefer it to the trash yon had the impudence to offer me a few minutes since.'' Mrs. Harvey again looked majestically indignant, but made no reply. So severe was her manner the remainder of the breakfast time that the boarders, though many of them were anxious, yet none of them had the temerity to ask for a second cup. Receiving his key from Hetty, Rule Ruby ascended the stairs to return to his room. While in the act of turning the key in his door, a low moan, as of some one in pain, fell on his ear. He paused a moment, to listen, and the moan was repeated. \" Some one is ill here,\" he muttered, drawing the key and putting it in his pocket. \" Who can it be ? I'll see !\" And turning to the door on his left, he knocked gently. \"Come in,\" said a weak, faint voice. Rule Ruby opened the door, and found himself in a large room with two win- dows looking out upon the street. A fire place was there, but\u2014 although the winds were howling without, and the morning was hitter cold\u2014 no fire. Two oeds were on each side of the room ; and on the one nearest the door lay a youn<* man, of apparently three and twenty years, his face, thin and wan, and rendered still more ghastly by his unshaven beard. . \"Good morning, sir,\" said Rule Ruby bowing, \"I was passing to my room wken I heard you groan. You appear to be ill and entirely deserted. Can I do anything for you V \u00ab Thank you for your offer sir,\" returned the young man ; \u00ab I am ill-perhaps dyrng\u2014 and the heartless wretches allow me to waste away here without food or \"Can it be possible ?\" said Rule Ruby in amazement. \"Wait a moment and you shall have both.\" . muuieni, So \u00bbaying, he quitted the room. ,iSe\u00bb\u21220ft,lbefn Sbf nt ?\u00a3!Vaia&* ere he retr\u00ab\"d, followed by Hetty with an armful of wood, and by Mrs. Harvey, with a larpr W.i r.r tuJ 1 that she ''reserved for her sick boarders.\" g \u00b0Wl \u00b0f the mocha- A fire soon blazed on the hearth, and the warm mocha soon gave to the wan face of the young invalid a more pleasing expression. \" Send up some warm, unbuttered toast for my friend madam \" snid R\u201el\u201e P u sternly, as the two females were quitting the room* ' * Rab-V\u00ab \" Yes fp J1\"\" Hrey' 8trugg\"ng to conceal her wrath.

Do you understand me, madam ?\" Mrs. Harvey made him no answer. The wood, however, came up, and, for the day, the room was kept, as the young man expressed it, comfortable. \"Can I do anything more for you, my friend?\" said Rule Ruby gently, and seating himself upon a chair close to the bed. The countenance of the sufferer lit up with gratitude, as he answered,\u2014 \" Thank you ! I have not been to the store these three days, and I have not been able to send word to my employer that illness keeps me away. If you can spare the time, you will oblige me very much by informing Mr. Clark that I am confined to my bed in consequence of a severe fall on my way home three days since.\" \" With pleasure, my sriend,\" said Rule Ruby, rising. \" Your name is '\u25a0 \" Lewis Hudson.\" '\u2022 And Mr. Clark's place of business \" \" Is at No. \u2014 Pearl street,\" said the clerk. \" Very good.\" \" I shall be ever grateful \" \" Never mind that,\" interrupted Rule Ruby, hastily. \" I have business down town, and will attend to your message on my way. Good bye !\" \" Good bye !\" And Rule Ruby proceeded to his room. Having carefully closed his door, he drew a letter from his side pocket in the breast of his coat, and, seating himself on the edge of his bed, read as follows : \u2014 \" In all things, and to the letter obey, fulfil and perform the orders of the man from whose hands you received this letter. In his hands yon must be a mere instrument. As he bids you, so must you act, without a thought, or doubt, or murmur. In regard 10 your business, if questioned, you must answer according to circumstances. I would prefer, however, tbat you be silent. The reward I piomised you is unusually large, but it shall be as nothing to immensity, if you accomplish your task to my satisfaction. The man who gives you this will supply you with all the appliances necessary to your success. You shall hear from me no more till your task is done, or till I receive word that you play the laggard in your work. 17.\" For some moments after his perusal of this letter the young man was bathed in reflection. Whatever was passing in his mind, whether of great or minor impor tance, it was impossible to trace it on his calm, clear features : not a shade was on his brow, not a tone in his clear dark eye, not an expression on his fine, superblv chiselled lip. In truth there was something brilliant and satanic in the shade, contour, and marble-like rigidity of his features. He seemed one sent to eartli on a fearful mis sion. The shades which hung around his brow, eyes, lips, and nostrils gave him, when immersed in thought or excitement on aspect that made one shudder. At the moment he was engaged in reading the letter we have described, the attorney. Griffin, was intently examining a letter sent him by his friend in Phila delphia. It ran thus : \u2014 \" The man that I have chosen is, of all the world, the man wantedlin a work like this. At his birth, to use the language of the Greeks, the gods must have pre sided ; for to the beauty of an Adonis he adds the cunning of a snake ; to the strength of a Hercules, he adds the flexibility of an eel ; with the voice of an angel, he combines the heart of a fiend. Look to him well; so begirt him with work that no time shall be his for thought ; and be sure the game is ours. I would sug gest that he be kept as much as possible from the handling of ready money ; it will make him feel his dependency, and, consequently, keep him true to our inter ests. At the same time, see that fie wants for nothing. When he needs clothes, give him an order on some tailor, and so in regard to everything he may want. When to succeed in his tasks, it is necessary for him to go to any place of amuse^"], [62, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 54 ment, procure the ticket and give it him yourself. In this way, he will feel the bsolateneisof his dependencv, and render him what it is necessary for our scheme he should be, a passive, convenient instrument. But it will be necessary to leave him to his own resources in prosecuting his tasks ; for if clogged or impeded, his pride may tempt him to rebel. Use your own best judgment, however, and^so far follow my suggestions only as you find them practicable. 17.' CHAPTER IV. THE MERCHANT. Quitting his boardinj-house. Rule Ruby bent his steps towards the lower part of the city. Entering Pearl street, he sought the store of Alison Clark, to deliver the message of the clerk. It was a cold, raw day; and the thin, spare clothes of the young man, as he jogged his way through ihe numerous clerks, porters, carmen, and others who were running and bustling before, behind, and beside him, drew upon him many a de risive smile and flippant jest. Heedless of all this, however, he strode on, till his eye detected a large, gilded, glaring sign with this inscription : \" Alison Clark, im porter of dry goods.\" There was that about the doors which told of activity, energy, capital and credit. Two or three carmen were putting large boxes of goods upon their carts ; a num ber of porters were hoisting and lowering bales by the fall ; a goodly array of clerks were seen inside, taking down, putting up, and packing calicoes, woollens, and silks. A long, low, wide counter was seen on each side of the wide, deep store ; while far away in the farthest part, might be seen a long high desk, with a short, steut man mounted on a high stool behisd it, bending over an immense ledger, as if the science of figures were to him the one great acme of life. Sitting before a grate, and looking over a large newspaper, might be seen a tall, slender, gentlemanly-looking personage of about five and tnirty years. He was dressed in a suit of plain black ; and though, as he looked calmly over the newspaper, he appeared totally unconscious of the life and bustle and activity and energy around him, yet one glance at his bold, striking features convinced you that he was the man, the master-spirit whose mind controlled that vast establishment. As Rule Ruby ascended the two granite steps leading to the store, an old man, dressed in a plain brown suit, with a black, low-crowned, broad-brimmed hat, pre ceded him. The latter, as if accustomed to such scenes, proceeded straightway towards the man reading the paper, aud accosted him with, \u2014 \"Mr. Clark, I believe?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered the merchant, laying down his paper, and offering his visitor a chair. \"Mr. Alison Clark, I believe?\" repeated the old man, taking the proffered chair. \" Yes, sir,\" replied the merchant, blandly. \" I am just from Liverpool, Mr. Clark,\" said the old man, examining his fea tures with an air of interest, \" where 1 have traded with you, I believe,\" he added, with a benevolent smile. \" My name is Brown, sir \u2014 Adam Brown.\" \"Ah, indeed!\" cried the merchant, grasping his hand warmly. \" I am happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Brown. When did you arrive, sir ?\" \" On the second, Mr. Clark ; on the second, in the Whuehaven.\" \" Ah, indeed, Mr. Brown ; happy indeed to see you ; where do you stay sir ?'' -' At the City Hotel, Mr. Clark.\""], [63, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 55 \" A very fine hotel, sir, I believe ; you could not have selected a better, if you had been a resident.\" \" Ah, I have been a resident,\" answered the old trader ; \" I have been here before, sir ; 'tis some years, though \u2014 'tis some years. A very fine city it has grown to, since I left it ; it quite astonished me when I landed ; I couldu't have believed it, Mr. Clark \u2014 I really couldn't \u2014 it's astonishing.\" At this moment Rule Ruby advanced. \" You wish to see Mr. Clark, young man ?\" said the old trader, catching his eye. At this moment the merchant turned. As his glance fell on the young man, he said coldly, \u2014 \" Well, sir.\" \" 1 am requested,\" said Rule Ruby, respectfully, \" to call and let you know, sir, that one of your clerks, Lewis Hulson, had a severe fall while on his way home three days ago, and that the illness consequent upon that accident confines him to his bed. He trusts that his illness will not affect his situation.\" \" A well-spoken young man,\" said the old trader, with a benevolent smile ; \" very well-spoken. He ought to be a merchant \u2014 he ought, indeed.\" Alison Clark examined the messenger a few moments from head to foot, and then replied. \u2014 \" His illness shall, of course, not affect his situation ; you can tell him so from me. But you, sir \u2014 from your appearance, one would take you to be very poor. Do you wish work, sir 1\" \" No, sir,\" answered Ruby. \"If you are not engaged, sir, I should be pleased to give you a situation in my store,\" continued the merchant. \"Thank you, sir, I wish it not,\" said Rule Ruby, respectfully. \" Having de livered my message, I will now proceed about my business.\" The merchant looked after him in silence till he had disappeared at the door. '\u25a0 A remarkable young man that,\" observed the old trader, as the merchant turned to him ; \" a very remarkable young man \u2014 says what he has to say in as few words as possible, and indulges in no useless remarks ; knows his own busi ness, and how to keep it. If 1 were again in business, Mr. Clark, I would give a high salary for the services of a young man like him. A remarkable young man, Mr. Clark \u2014 very remarkable indeed.\" Having thus delivered himself, the old trader exhumed a large, round, old fashioned snuff-box from the right pocket of his old brown coat, and, opening it, drew forth an enormous pinch, and applied it to his nostrils with wonderful dex terity, and, without making any noise at all, caused it suddenly to disappear. Having performed this feat, the old gentleman returned the box to his pocket, and then drew forth a long bed-quilt-of-a-handkerchief of raw silk, and, opening it, revealed a wonderful number of blue and white dots. Holding one end of it in his lest hand, with the other he brought the bulk of the article to his nostrils, and gently drew it across, to wipe away as tenderly as possible the scattered partieles that might have neglected to go where he directed them. And all this was done so noiselessly, any one could have seen that the old trader was one of those easy, loving-la w-and-order kind of people, so common in past generations, and so ex tremely scarce in this. *' Have you given up your business, Mr. Brown ?\" said the merchant, with a bland smile. \" So far as my Liverpool business is concerned, I have, Mr. Clark,\" returned the old trader. \" I have returned to spend my last days in my native land, Mr. Clark. I am not certain whether I shall resume business in America or not, Mr. Clark. There are so many young, sprightly, active rascals in business here, Mr. Clark, that I am afraid there is no room for a dry old codger like me.\" At this mirthful remark, the old gentleman indulged in a fit of silent laughter that threatened to strangle him. The more grave and silent merchant fixed his eyes thoughtfully on the old man at times, and marvelled why he dragged in his name so frequently, as if the mere"], [64, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 56 sound of it gave him some innate pleasure. Clark was not a man to permit any advantage to slide through his fingers, when by clasping them he could grasp and make it firmly his. The spirit of trade, and the wide-spread lust for wealth, had seized tbis man's soul, and given to alibis thoughts and veins one sole colour \u2014 self interest ; and as he looked on that old veteran trader, with his frank, simple, hontst face, and on that silver-glistening hair, and on that old-fashioned suit of brown, he debated within himself how he could turn the visit of the old veteran to dollar and cents account. \"The market is deeply crowded, it is true, Mr. Brown,\" said the merchant, for the purpose of drawing him out ; \" but the major part of our commerce is carried on by credit. There is now, and will be for a hundred years to come, plenteous room for capital, when backed by tact and talent.\" \" Ah, Mr. Clark,\" said the old man, smiling, \" live and let live is my motto. I have been in the commercial arena long enough, and 'tis but fair and fitting that I now give place to others. Besides, I am old, Mr. Clark, and waat rest ; the hardiest constitutions grow rusty and worthless at last. The art of commerce is a high and holy calling, Mr. Clark, if we but toil in it manfully, honestly, and with as due regard for others' welfare as our own. I love the spirit of trade \u2014 it is my father, mother, brother, sister, bride, sir. I have been a soldier inks ranks forfive and forty years, and can now lay down my arms and say, ' I have never jostled, by word, or thought, or deed, a fellow-soldier, of whatever rank or creed.' * \"You are not married, Mr. Brown ?\" said the wily merhant, with a smile. \" Who, I, Mr. Clark?\" cried the veteran trader, with a laugh that nearly shook his little fat, pursy boiy all to pieces; \"Adam Brown married? Old Adam Brown, the single-stick, married ? Ha, ha, ha ! A capital joke that, Mr. Clark ! Very capital, indeed! Do I look like a married man, sir? Ha, ha, ha! Do I look like a married man, Mr. Clark ? I'm too dry, sir. The women never would have anything to say to me \u2014 nothing at all, sir \u2014 not one of them, Mr. Clark \u2014 not one of them, sir. Old Adam Brown a married man \u2014 ha, ha, ha '\" And the old gentleman shook and cried himself almost to death with laughter. \" Have you no relatives, Mr. Brown ?\" said the merchant, affecting to partici- pate in the old man's mirth. Thus step by step \u2014 question by question, did the wily merchant draw all his secrets from the frank, unsuspecting trader. '' No*, that I know of, Mr. Clark, \u2014 not that I know of,\" replied Adam Brown, \" that is to say, Mr. Ckrk, none that know me. I had a brother once \u2014 an upright, honourable man, Mr. Clark ; that is to say, he was an unswerving, high- minded boy \u2014 for it was in our ooyhood we parted. But whether he is in America, or where, I know not. He was a right good fellow, Mr. Clark, very steady in his heart, in his duties and in his friendships. But it is a good while ago, Mr. Clark \u2014 a very great while ago,\" added the old man, sadly, \"and with years come changes, disappearances, deaths.\" The old man dropped his eyes upon the burning grate, and appeared to be chasing mentally old events and old times. The wily merchant took this opportunity to scan with his dark, keen eye, the old man's features. \" He has not told me all !* he muttered ; \" some thought, some fact, he keeps concealed !'' He would not press the veteran too much, he thought\u2014 it might awake suspi- cion ; but he'd sift him still\u2014 something must come of it. Besides, he had a scheme\u2014 perhaps a trap \u2014 to ensnare the unsuspecting veteran, and transfer the wealth his long patient toil must have won, into bis own cunning grasp. \" You have no relatives or friends then, Mr. Brown,\" said Clark, in a smooth, cunning voice, \"with whom you can spend the winter of your days?\" The question was artful, forcible, in the very tones to enter the core of a frank confiding heart. ' The book-keeper looked up from his book, and fixed his small, round eyes on his wily employer\u2014 for he knew him to the very centre of his heart ; and *liud-"], [65, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 57 dered to think how the guileless old trader might become the wily young man's prey. \" No. sir, that is, Mr. Clark, \u2014 I have no friends, or relatives that I know of,'' said Adam Brown, with a sigh. \" But money can purchase merchant, feelingly. courtesies and comforts, Mr. Brown,\" suggested the \"True,\" said the old man brighteningfup, \" But there are things \u2014 I might say attributes \u2014 that money cannot buy,\" con tinued the wily merchant. \" Right, Mi. Clark, right !\" And the old trader sighed. \"Such as friendship \u2014 the friendship that springs from the heart, Mr. Brown,\" con tinued Clark with deep seeling, aud casting a loving affectionate glance at the trader. \" You mean affection, Mr. Clark?\" said Adam Brown, earnestly. \" Yes, my friend 1\" No. 8."], [66, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 58 ..... He's-coming to it !\" muttered the book-keeper. \"It's not Mr. Brown now\u2014 it's his friend !\" r _\u25a0 \u2022 t And the indignant book-keeper rushed furiously up a column of fractions to expend his swelling wrath. \"Affection is hard to be found !\" sighed the old trader. \"Like all things else,\" said the merchant gravely, '* it has its birth hour. But then, as you say, dear friend, it is hard to be found.\" \" Very !\" exclaimed Adam Brown, with a deep sigh. \" His dear friend !\" muttered the clerk. \" Oh, he's coming it nicely over the old man now.\" \" But what is equal to affection in our hours of relaxation,\" continued the merchant. \" Especially in one's old age,\" added the trader. \" It repays us for all our toils aud uneasinesses and cares,\" said the merchant ; \" it is balm to the wounded soul.\" \" It is,\" said Adam Brown, feelingly. \" What can equal it ?\" said the merchant enthusiastically. \u2022' Ah \u25a0 what ?\" exclaimed the old trader. \" Not base and sordid wealth,\" continued the merchant, drawing himself up, proudly, as if he despised anything in the shape of wealth : \" Give me friendship and affection before all the wealth or gewgaws in the world !\" And drawing his seat closer to his companion, he leaned his hand affectionately over the back of his chair, and drew a deep sigh. The old trader was so affected at this specimen of Clark's warm-hearted nature that tears rose to his eyes. As for the little round-eyed book-keeper, he flung a glance before him to see if any of the clerks were looking towards him, and finding himself unobserved, he turned his eyes on the fawning hypocrite and frowned so heavily that he almost brought on a headache. \" My sentiments exactly, Mr. Clark '\" exclaimed Adam Brown, somewhat agitated. \" I'm happy, my friend, very happy that we so harmonise in our thought !\" returned the merchant, in a voice slightly ruffled by emotion. \" If it were not too bold, Mr. Brown \u2014 I would say my friend \u2014 may I use that endearing term, Mr. Brown ?'' he added in the anxious tone of one airaid he has gone too far. \" You may,\" said the old trader, extending his hand, which the other grasped warmly. \" Jt it were not too bold, my friend, I would take upon myself to offer you a home in my house for the remainder of your days \u2014 it would be such a consolation to me,\" he added, hastily, \u2022' to have one near me from whose experience I could learn wisdom, and from whose noble heart 1 might leam to school my thoughts and actions eveT unto greatness !\" The old trader was deeply affected ; so much so that his whole frame trembled, and he turned away his head to hide the tears of gratitude that had risen to his eyes and fallen upon his cheeks. The wily merchant watched the effect of his hypocrisy, and a slight smile played for a moment around his small, thin lips. The little book-keeper turned now white, now blue, and then red ; in fact, for about the space of ten seconds, his face seemed, by some mysterious process, to undergo all the changes of the seasons and all the colours of the rainbow. His pen kept running up and down the figure and the fraction columns as if chasing an invisible cipher. \" It would be presuming too much on your good nature !\" said the old trader, with emotion. . \"But it would make me so happy!\" urged the wily merchant, in an agitated voice. \" Consent, jny dear friend, and I will be to you a second son. My wife and I will look upon you as a father. We have no children, and we will strive a little family of three \u2014 te render each other so happy !\""], [67, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 59 \"I consent!\" cried the old man, wringing his hand. \"You make me so happy!\" returned the merchant, with affected emotion. \" This, I may truly say, is the happiest moment of my life ! Your hand upon it!'1 \" Gone ! sucked dry ! eternally drained and diddled !\" muttered the little round-eyed book-keeper, bowing his head over his ledger in despair. CHAPTER V. THE MANSFIELDS. In Mott street, between Spring and Prince, there stood in the days of which we are treating, an old brick building of some four stories, greatly wasted and worn by time and deeply steeped in filth by the carelessness, laziness, and natural nlthiness of the major part of its numerous occupants. The step of freestone which based the entrance, by its indented hollow, told plainly the age of the building and the vast number of tenants, that had occupied it since its erection. It had evidently been built for the ostensible use of poor families : for, as you passed through the long, broad, dirty entry up to the second, third and fourth stories, the peculiar division of the walls \u2014 so planned as to give a small \" room and bedroom \" to each family \u2014 struck you at once. Independently of this arrangement, a rear wing was attached to the structure, having one room on each story, in each of which was a small fire place : and in each of which lived, slept, cooked and washed some small family : the long, broad entry already alluded to being the sole means of ingress aud egress to the vast number of human beings occupying the building. In the rear- part of the fourth story of this miserable rookery dwelt the Mansfields ; and in the small room of the attached wing, and on the same floor, for the time being, livid our slight acquaintance, Dick Hazard and his notable companion, Tib. With these brief remarks, we will now ascend the narow stairs leading to the apartments of the Mansfields. It is a raw and gusiy day < the ice is \"hard upon the side-walks ; the winds wail dismally, and the pendant signs creak to and fro in the cold, rushing air ; the skies are dark and lowering, aod the sharp moaning atmosphere cuts through clothes and flesh, into the very marrow. In its rage, the angry blast seems to be warring against the poor, the garmentless, the houseless, and wretched. It is an awful day \u2014 there is a wail in every sweep of the fiercely rushing winds. You in voluntarily sigh for the homeless, the stricken, an\u00ab the poor. You mutter a \"God help them ! \" and wish you had something \u2014 no matter how trifling \u2014 to give them. Let us pass up stairs. The hoarse wind sweeps through the long broad entry, and dashes up from story to story, in a mournful wail, and thunders against the walls and cielings as if bent on completing, with one or a series of heavy sweeps, the misery of the unhappy poor whose only refuge is in that wretched building. The stairs are black with dirt and indented by time and ceaseless use. It is no small personal risk to ascend them, so worn and rickety are they at each step. The atmosphere on each story, jespite the sweeping cold, is sickly ; almost enough to breed contagion. As you ascend and perceive the graspin? spirit of the avaricious hind who erected the structure, in the small, cell-like room divisions, your heart recoils as if the envenomed tongue of an adder was poised before you, and you ex claim \u2014 \" Great God ! can one having the heart of man, have the conscience to bury alive his fellow beings in these wretched cells ! \" Four families on one floor"], [68, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 60 tie rooms small, low and dirty, inviting pestilence and misery and death. Think of it! We are now on the landing of the fourth story. The walls and partitions, yea and the ceiling, are cracked, and the cold cutting wind comes rushing through the broken lathes where the plaster has fallen. The landing is so narrow here that only one person can pass at one time. Thank God for that ! for the wind has less room to cut its antics in ! The banisters are broken\u2014 take erre! One misstep and down you fall, never to rise again ; for the stairs are steep and crazy, and death awaits you at the bottom. Let us knock at the door of the Mansfields, and now let us enter. Great God! what a sight ! The room is scarce twelve feet in width, hardly fifteen in length. One window only lights it. A door opens into a small bedroom at the side, and through the opening we behold an old, rickety, broken cot, scantily covered with clothes, with a smalt thin, haggard, sickly wretch distended upon it. On a chair beside the cot stands a su.all flask of wine, a multitude of small medicine phials, and the half of an orange. That is the chamber of acknowledged suffering and sickness. Let us return to the outer room. What a picture ! Opposite the window, a small fire-place with a small iron-bound furnace, con taining a small fire; a broken basket, half filled with coals, tells the melancholy story that the Mansfields are so poor, they have to buy their fuel by the small measure. In a corner we behold a straw tick, with one sheet and an old blanket for its only covering. Between the bed and door, a cheap pine table stained with red. Near the window, two rickety chairs, and a low stool, purchased at some cheap auction. A cheap coarse straw hat hangs on a nail against the wall oppo site the door, and the window reveals a small pile of books, viz., a Bible, ireog ra phy and spelling book. The bare floor is scrupulously clean. Nought else ? Save the inhabitants, nothing ! Kj Grouped, and on the chairs and stool near the window, sit two females and a youth, whose vacant eyes tell this melanchely fact \u2014 he is stone-blind 1 The elder of the females is perhaps in the vicinity of nineteen or twenty ; and despite the plainness and meagreness of her apparel, she is of a high order of beauty. Her fair oval face, her pale full forehead, and bright blue eyes, though tinctured with melancholy, evince intellect, resolution, and energy ; and yet there is a softness in her small ruby lips and a sweetness in the general expression of her fine features that tell of a guileless lovini; heart, and a heavenly soul. In figure, she is faultless, as if the Great Maker, when moulding her, had designed her for a paragon ( f his workman- hip. The younger girl, of some fourteen or fifteen, is fair, too, and in outline of feature and expression bears a strong resemblance to the elder ; but there is a strange light in her soft blue eyes ; and it tells of a weak, childish, and \u2014 must we tell it '\u2014demented brain. The elder is toiling, with quickness and energy, over a vest of costly velvet ; the younger looking on with an insane eye, and a childish smile ; the youth, of some seventeen or eighteen, sits lonely and silent, his closed hands resting on his lap, his sightless eyes cast down, like one in silent prayer. Alas ! day and night, cloud and sunshine were all one to that poor blind youth, and the beautiful sight of earth cut off from him for ever ! A sad picture \u2014 dreary, dark, woelul, heart-splitting. And on the shoulders of that poor, fair, toiling girl, what a weight of responsi bility and suffering ! A sick, helpless, dying lingering father\u2014 a witless, helpless sister\u2014 a blind, helpless brother ! Is it a marvel that her cheeks are pale and wan \u2014 her eyes weak, and her whole countenance tinged with melancholy ? Is it a mar vel that her fingers ply the needle with such quickness, earnestness, and dexterity ? Is it a marvel that her heart is sad and her lips voiceless ? And this is the family that the heartless lawyer would dissever \u2014 this poor girl the sole main stay and support of her feeble dying parent, her demented sister and' poor blind, helpless brother, \u2014 this is the poor girl that the heartless lawyer"], [69, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 61 sends his myrmidons to crush and rob. of the sole means and hope of bread \u2014 life! But not yet had they killed him ; not yet had they stilled for ever the voice and breath of that poor, lingering consumptive ; though strong, bold, cunning, and nu merous were their attempts. In this wild, fretful, scheming, bustling, frenzied world, it would seem that no human agency can take away the life of one weary of the things and scenes of time till the purpose for which that being was created is carried out to the end ; and till that moment, an unseen angel guards the citadel of life. Its work done, the voice of the Great Maker whispers the angel \u2014 '* Desert thy post now ; for the destiny of that frail being is accomplished,\" In the case of the consumptive, Mansfield, we find an illustration of this seeming ; for, as the reader is already aware, three stern foes were working with all their might and main, to hurry him into the eternities, viz., grim poverty, human cupidity, incurable disease and ma lignant poison. And yet, strange \u2014 strange at first sight \u2014 the poor man's pulse beat the tattoo of life. But let us look into his heart \u2014 for every heart hath its untold and unbarred se crets, yearnings and griefs. Yea, let us cleave the flesh, and raise the skin, and gaze upon the real aspect of the sick man's heart. What behold we ? A sight to make one's blood creep ! Right \u2014 and yet it is the heart of a true being \u2014 one who never, in thought, word, or deed, had wronged his fellow breathers of God's free given air. Let us look now at that fluttering heart. How it rises and falls with contending emotions ! Conscious that its lease of life is fast drawing to a close, how it trembles for the final flutter, the final gasp that shall close its existence here, and usher it into the great world, where Jehovah and all his angelic legions burst visibly on the eye ! And now another feeling \u2014 the dear ones that must be left behind \u2014 homeless, friendless, moneyless ! the three \u2014 and all young \u2014 the one mindless, the second, blind \u2014 the third, already half crushed with unwearied toil, relentless watching, ceaseless self-denial, alight food, broken sleep ! To go into Eternity and leave these poor friendles ones behind ! The world is wide, and full, and cold, and cruel ! His death, too \u2014 with the flight of his soul, to bis tender ones comes sterner po verty \u2014 for death must have his coffin and his grave, and these cost \u2014 money ! True, Potter's field \u2014 the long, wide, deep trenches of Potter's Field, would fur nish his corse a resting-place free of charge \u2014 that's something ; the corporation furnish a coffin and a hearse \u2014 three items settled ; no anxiety on this score ! But Marian could not find it in her heart to work on the night or day of his death, or, in all probability, for a day or two afterwards \u2014 this is to be thought of; for in that time \u2014 that time lost \u2014 the stomachs of the blind boy, the witless girl, and even of Marian, would yearn and cry for bread ! This is a thought to make that poor consumptive heart flutter in its last, feeble stages ! More than this. There is a small globule there in the core of that heart ; and in that globule there is hidden a memory \u2014 a memory of old and better times ; when wealth \u2014 perhaps competence were a truer word \u2014 was his ; when the com forts of life were his ; when hope was bright within him ; when happiness was his, the day, week, month, and year round j when the wife of his bosom was happy with him ; when friends were dear and true to him ; when \u2014 and this was the dark thought \u2014 when he trusted too much to one friend and became a ruined man. Beside this globule we behold another ; smaller, but clearer \u2014 a memory, too ; the memory of his elder brother. The brother, who in his youth had run away from home to try his fortunes in a foreign land. Where is that brother now ? Lives he? Oh, if he lives, why is it he sends not some kindly word of his con dition and existence ! This globule flutters now ; for it feels that if that absent brother were here or knew of the state of his relative, he would take the tender ones \u2014 so soon to be made orphans \u2014 under his sheltering arm ! And now all the globules of that dying heart are fluttering and trembling \u2014 a crisis is approaching. Let us drop the flesh upon it and look upon the consump-"], [70, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 62 tfve's face. The brow is calm, the eyes thoughtful, the nostrils quiet, the lipg closed. The intensity of thought and the intensity of agonising reflection can produce even this calm aspect. If this be so, then a terrible crisis is at hand \u2014 if terrible, then that poor trembling heart cannot meet it and bear up. It is now two of the clock. The hoarse winds are sweeping in mournful howls around the crazv building ; you can hear them in the long, broad entry below, in the landings of each story, in the dark chimneys, and around and overhead. It is now two of the clock, and the feet of the poor consumptive grow cold and numb. The wretched man turns on his side, trusting that the movement of his turning will cause the blood in his thin veins to rush towards his feet and destroy their numbness. As he turns, his weak eye falls upon the three \u2014 his darling ones, \u2014 the blind orbs of the boy cast down \u2014 the eyes of the witless one gaziug at her elder, toiling sister. Terrible picture ! At sight of it, that feeble consumptive should groan : but he is silent ! Look now at his eyes \u2014 they are fixed on the toiling Marian \u2014 a tear is on her eyelids, and another on her cheek. Agonising sight ! But the consumptive sighs not \u2014 he groans not. Is he made of iron ? Let us approach and lay our hand upon bis breast \u2014 the heart is still ! the con sumptive is no more ! The last sight the dying man beheld was a woe- tear on the pale cheek of his darling Marian. Poverty, disease, cupidity and poison had done their work ; aud thus calmly, noiselessly left the woe-laden spirit its tenement of clay, and thus noiselessly winged itself up to the judgment-hall of souls. Still onward and noiselessly flew the needle through the vest, still hung the tear upon the eyelid, and its mate upon the cheek. Still downcast were the blind boy's eyes, still fixed upon her sister the orbs of the witless girl. Still howled the sweeping winds. Minutes fly, and the vest is nearly done. The buttons alone remain to be put on \u2014 Marian's eyes light up as, beneath her skilful fingers, she sees her work so near its welcome end. Industriously has she worked to-day, and now her task is all but finished. A few more stitches, and \u2014 The door opens, and a woman, of the common size, enters. Did you ever see such a face ? She is not over thirty-five, nor seems she older. But look at her hideous features \u2014 the bold, sharp chin, the th:'n, livid lips, the hawk nose, the small green, glittering eyes, the white arching brows, the low heavy forehead! the sandy hair, halt hidden by her red handkerchief, wound like a turban, around' her head. A smile is on this woman's lip as she enters. '.' I have got through my work, Marian, and am come to help you. How is your father f\" Though repulsive in aspect, this woman's voice is sweet and winning. \"Thank you, Mrs. Hazard,\" answered Marian, looking up for a moment. \" Fa ther is better, I believe.\" Mrs. Hazard glanced towards the bed and beheld, as she thought, the con sumptive looking mournfully at Marian. \" Are you better, Mr. Mansfield ?\" said she, gently. No answer came, and Marian turned her head. \" Are you better pa'?\" The mournful eyes were fixed on her ; but the lips were silent. \"Do you want anything, pa'?\" said Marian, rising and going towards'ihe bed. * The father answered not, nor moved as she approached, and a painful , sprang to the poor girl's heart. \" Pa'?\" she continued, laying her hand affectionately on his brow. But the brow was cold and pale \u2014 very, very pale. At this moment the blood deserted Marian's face\u2014 her heart became numb sight fled her eyes\u2014 strength deserted her\u2014 her knees trembled\u2014 she tottered back and fell upon the hard, bnre floor. As she fell, the green eye. of the neighbour, Mrs. Hazard, lit up, for a moment with nudden flash of triumph."], [71, "THB ADVENTURES OF A VAOABOND. 63 \" What is the matter \u2014 what is the matter V cried the blindboy, springing Up. \" What is the matter ?\" \"Something very funny, I'm sure!\" said the crazy girl, with a vacant laugh. \" Do tell me what is the matter !\" cried the blind boy, spreading his arms around in bewilderment ; \" do tell me what is the matter, won't you? What noise was that ? Has any one fallen f\" \" Ha, ha ! funny, isn't it '\" laughed the crazy girl, clapping her hands. At this moment, the green-eyed woman raised the chair on which the blind boy had been sitting, and, as he was feeling his way towards the bed-room, maliciously placed it before him. The poor boy fell over it, with a loud cry, and dashed his his head against the door frame. \"Ha! ha !\" laughed the crazy girl, clapping her hands in delight, \"this is fun, isn't it 1\" Steps were now heard in the passage without. \" I must secure this !\" muttered the neighbour, Mrs. Hazard. As she spoke, she seized the vest, and plunged it hastily into a pocket in the side of her frock. The door now opened, and two or three females came running in. \" What is the matter, Mrs. Hazards?\" they cried. \" Help me up with this poor boy !\" said the latter, in an agitated voice. \" Mr. Mansfield is dead, Marian has fainted, this poor boy has fallen down in a fit, and hurt himselt !\" CHAPTER VI. in poisons*. Dats and weeks have flown since the incidents recorded in the\" preceding chapter. According to agreement, Adam Brown took up his abode in the house of the merchant, Alison Clarke. The latter being without children, the merchant's family now consisted of himself, Mrs. Clark, and the veteran trader. Though his family was thus small, Alison Clark found that the expenses of his establishment were enormous : for his wife, a slave to fashion and display, lived in the most extravagant manner. In fact, the establishment of the merchant Alison Clark was one to -. stonish and out-rival even the wealthy fashionables of his neighbourhood. His household furniture was of the most brilliant and costly description. Nothing could exceed it either in elegance or splendour. It was, in every respect, a model, and one known throughout the city as \" the palace of the merchant prince.\" This latter title had long since been bestowed upon Alison Clark for his extraordinary and brilliant success in all his business relations ; and indeed he seemed to deserve the title, for whatever he undertook, no matter how unpromising, it appeared to brighten and suddenly change to gold. But with all this \u2014 for all his success \u2014 the heart of the thrifty merchant was tainted with the gold thirst of the miser. Nothing daunted, nothing stayed ihim, when once he had made up his mind to carry out any given design. Still, he did everything with the advice of his lawyer ; and no matter how base or fraudulent his schemes, he ever stood on the safe side of that many-faced monster, law ; and as his law yer had the same views in regard to the art of money-making, and was, withal, as daring and hypocritical as himself, it cannot be wondered that he prospered. But prosperity, like hypocrisy, knavery and enterprise, has its limits; reaching which, a single error, one false step, overwhelms all and turns the current adown the rock ledge leading to the wide stream of ruin."], [72, "64 THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. In the case of the witness Mansfield, Griffin had assured his client, Alison Clark, that that witness would not appear against him. As we have already seen, he had good grounds for giving such an assurance ; and the merchant's heart was at rest, at least so far as that case was concerned. But why that witness would not appear against him was a thing concerning which Alison Clark gave himself no uneasiness. His lawyer and himself understood each other ; and Alison Clark never asked any useless questions. It was enough for him that the lawyer had given him the necessary and welcome assurance. But he had paid for it: the case, as will be seen hereafter, was an important one, and the wily attorney had charged his client in proportion to the importance of the case. But Clark, at the time of the opening of this chapter, was in difficulties ; one venture, in which he had staked a heavy amount, had failed, and its failure had placed him in deep embarrassment. He had, beside, several notes to meet, and lacked the ability to meet them ; and for the first time in many years, this man's cheek blanched at the critical state of his finances. He had exhausted his friends and credit, and his straitened circumstances had been whispered on 'change. Be sides all this, he had his rivals \u2014 tivals whom he had outdistanced and outwitted \u2014 who spared neither whispers nor inuendoes to still farther injure his name and credit, and who would gladly have seen him fall. Of all this Clark was conscious, and his heart throbbed and his cheek blanched, at the critical state of his situa tion. The thought crossed him to apply for a loan to his sriend Adam Brown, but this thought was banished, as soon as conceived, for it might mar his designs on the old man, and breed suspicion. Still, this thought haunted him, and as the time drew nigh when his first heavy note fell due, his heart whispered him a le sort that might relieve and wonderfully enrich him. As this idea rose to his brain, his cheek became livid, and his system so agitated that he could scarcely hide it. In this condition, with his brain in a fever, he summoned his servant, bade him bring him a horse, and mounting it, rode out into the suburbs 10 conceal his agitation and ride down the fearful thought. But in vain; for although he succeeded in composing his nerves, the dark thought still hung in his brain till he looked upon it with calmness ; familiarity had banished its hideousness, and when he returned to the city, his severe features had resumed their accustomed calmness. After tea, Alison Clark left his dwelling, and bent his steps in the direction of Pearl-street. As he turned from Broadway into the latter street, he fixed his eye on a three story building of brick, not far from the corner, on the private door of which was a brass plate bearing this simple announcement : \u2014 sio. fkanzoni. Looking before and behind him, to see if any were wa.ching him, and finding himself apparently unnoticed, he made hastil'v to the door of the buildioc and rang the bell. c' \"Is Signor Franzoni at home ?\" he asked of the mulatto boy who had opened the door. v \"If you will please walk in, I will see,\" was the reply; and the merchant was shown into a drawing-room, every whit as magnificent as his own. He was joined in a few minutes by a small-sized man, with numerous jew elled rings on his fingers, a heavy gold chain running from his neck to a side pocket in his vest, with moustache and imperial, and dressed in the extreme of fashion. The formalities of introduction over, his wrinkled face wreathed in smiles the Italian said, \u2014 ' \" In what can I serve you, sir ?\" \"I would coi. re with you where we should not be overheard.\" said the merchant."], [73, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 65 of talent 3-S2* +**** 5 \"' Und~d *~ ' *\u00bb\u25a0 need \" But, sir \" roomN'\u00b0 m\u00b0re\" man'\" S8id the merchant' \" Lead me to your privat. follwhin;1.ianl00kedat him fi\"dly a moment or two, and then bade his visito Franzoni led the merchant up two flights of stairs ; when turning to the les they passed into a small room belonging to the wing attached to the main building. The room was small \u2014 perhaps not more than fifteen feet in length, and certainly not more than twelve in width. The small window was curtained, the walls coloured with a pale green, and the floor covered with a fine figured carpet.

Your business ?\" This was certainly coming to the point, and the merchant was slightly agitated. \" This has a quaint smell,\" he said. \" You have essences and drugs here ? ' \" This is my cabinet, sir,\" answered the Italian, with a hideous smile. \" You make your poisons here ?\" said the merchant, uneasily. \"What mean you ?\" said the Italian smiling. \" You will oblige me, Signor Franzoni,\" said the merchant, with an effort, \" to understand me at once.\" And as he spoke, he bent his keen, dark eyes on those of the Italian. \" Go on, sir,\" said Franzoni.with a significant smile. \" You have powders and essences here,\" continued the merchant, with his eyes still fixed on the Italian, \" which you are in the habit of disposing to those who labour under the disadvantages of having rich but long-lived grandmothers, sturdy uncles, and obstinate aunts ?\" \" Well, sir ?\" said Franzoni, with his fixed smile. \" I need not tell you that, to these who watch the numerous records of deaths, large numbers of old people have died since your entrance into the city, aud left large fortunes to their heirs !\" \" What need of telling me this, sir ?\" said the ever-smiling Italian turning pale. \" To show you that I know you,\" was the reply. \" Therefore no trifling.\" \"Go on, sir,\" said the Italian, with a fawning smile. \" A friend of mine,\" continued the merchant, \"has long been ailing. Do you understand me, S'gnor Franzoni?\" The Italian bowed. '' He is tired of life,\" resumed the merchant, in a low voice ; \" and is about to depart on his long journey without noise or suspicion. Do you understand me?\" Franzoni nodded, smilingly. \" This, then,\" said the merchant, \"is the object of my visit.\" The Italian still kept his eye inquiringly on bis visitor, but replied not. \"Have lnot sufficiently explained myself?\" demanded the merchant, sternly. \"The articles of which you speak,\" said the poisoner, in a low, clear whisper, \" cost a great deal of money.\" \" What do you call a great deal of money, sir,\" said the merchant. \" The article that you want is a powder,\" said the poisoner ; \" and the making of it up requires a great deal of time, a great deal of care, and a great deal of cun ning, and, as I said before, a great deal of money.\" \" Have done with this trifling, and name your prioe ?\" said the merchant, sternly. \" The powder that you want,\" said the poisoner, \" will cost you five hundred dollars.'' Clark turned pale. \" So much ?\" he gasped. * I cannot sell it for less,\" remarked the Italian, superciliously. \" When a gen tleman wishes to help his friend out of this world of misery, particularly when he is long ailing, for the pleasure of doing so much good, five hundred dollars is a verv small sum.\" \" But it is rank extortion !\" said the merchant, with a frown. \" It is a kind of extortion that extorts again,\" said the poisoner, significantly. \" If this powder helps your friend to an easy, speedy death, and that death will bring you a number of thousands, a simple five hundred is, you must confess, a very trilling sum.\" \"I spoke not of death, nor of thousands 1\" exclaimed the merchant, colouring."], [75, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 67 \" No matter,\" rejoined the poisoner, with a dry smile. \" We understand each other.\" \" Cease this haggling, and produce the powder,\" said the merchant, impatiently. The poisoner bowed, and went to a rosewood cabinet. The merchant followed his movements with his sedfehing. ncrvojs eye. The Italian applied a small key to the lock, and the doors of the cabwet flew open, revealing three rows of shelves, on which, arranged with great neatness and regularity, were five rows of variously coloured phials, each row being above the Other. The merchant involuntarily shuddered, for well he knew that each phial con tained in it the bane of a thousand lives. His stomach sickened at the sight. \" Ten grains of this,\" said the poisoner, taking down from the third row a yel low bottle, and showing it to his visitor, \" ten grains of this, I say, dropped into a cup of tea, or a glass of water, will, two hours from the time it is taken, set the patient into a dos; ; from that into a calm, dreamless sleep ; and from that into a slumber so sound that he will not wake again, unless violently disturbed, for feur and twenty hours.'' \" The object of that ?\" said the merchant, in surprise. \" If you have a visitor or a friend, who is overburdened with papers or articles that will be of any benefit to you, a dose of this, carefully given, will enable you to obtain them without doing him any bodily barm. Suppose you wish to get out of the clutches of an officer, or qait the city, or prevent another from appearing against you at a certain time ; why give, or cause to be given him, as many grains of this over ten as you wish him to remain inactive. Say you want him to lie still for one day, you then give him ten grains; if for two days, twenty grains ; if for three, thirty grains ; and so on \u2014 taking care always not to give him over sixty grains at a time, as six days of sleep would end in starving him to death, and that would be \u2014 murder !\" *' If I should want a hundred grains of that, what would be its price ?\" said the merchant, thoughtfully. \" One hundred dollars,\" answered the poisoner. \" A dollar a grain ! impossible !\" exclaimed the merchant. \" That expression tells me that you have no use for it,\" remarked the Italian carelessly. \" Stay !\" said Clark, as the poisoner was about to return the bottle to its place. \" You may do up two hundred grains.\" \" With pleasure,\" returned the poisoner. And drawing a small pair of silver seales from the cabinet, he carefully measured the required quantity and placed it in a tiny, pink-coloured box. \" What else shall I have the pleasure of helping you to ?\" demanded the poisoner. \"I have told you the matter with my friend,\" answered the merchant, \"and you must follow your own judgment.\" \"This,\" said the poisoner, taking a phial of snowy powder from the cabinet, \" is the chef d'eeuvre of my art, and the costliest in my collection. You observe, how pale and clear it is\u2014 that, sir, is an emblem of its power and effect. It has this virtue : it can be given in anything, and have the same effect. It is a master- piece, and worthy of a monument to commemorate its extraordinary virtue?!\" added the Italian, enthusiatically. \"You can have no idea of its power, unless you try it ' The merchant smiled grimly. \" On your most hated enemy,\" continued the poisoner, with a dry smile. \"Then you will be able lo see the superb beauty with which it works. One grain of it dropped into a glass of water, engenders so sure, so deadly a poison, that nothing on earth can save the person who has drunk it. Nor leaves it a mark be hind : so calm does it work, that it neither disfigures the skin, nor swells the veins. * t crawls through the blood, through every vein, sowing death attevery step ; and It it goes to the heart, right into the very core, where nothing can displant or"], [76, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND- 68 'radicate it. A moment there, and the victim feels a sweet, thrilling sensation run 'ins through him; this is succeeded by a sleep, gentle at first, and gradually 'ncreasing, till the body petrifies into the cold, stiff, marble frame of death !\" The cool smile with which this was delivered engendered a sickening sensa tion in the merchant's breast. \"JIs this the powder that yon want?\" demanded the Italian, with a fiendish smile. \" Its cost?\" asked the merchant, shuddering. \" Five grains will cost you five hundred dollars,\" answered the poisoner. \" There is your money,\" said the merchant, drawing forth two bank notes and flinging them on the table. The poisoner took up the bills, and after a careful examination, put them into his pocket. This done, he carefully did up the powder in a small box, similar in size and colour to the first ; then wrapping both in a small sheet of vellum, deli vered the package to the merchant, who plunged it into a side pocket, and was about taking his departure, when the voice of the poisoner arrested him. \" I have yet another,'' said the Italian, with a satanic smile, \" that you per chance may fancy.\" \" What is't ?\" asked the merchant, abruptly. \" This,'' said the poisoner, taking down a small pink phial. \" Its virtues ?\" demanded the merchant, satirically. \" Oh, rare ! rare!\" replied the poisoner. \" If you have an aunt, or an uncle, or a grandfather or grandmother, whom age has rendered avaricious, three grains of this, mingled in the tobacco of his or her pipe, if he or she should smoke, will open his or her heart at once, and make it overflow with benevolence towards you. If the person taking it be naturally close with his money, it will give him a three days' fit of benevolence, which yon must take due advantage of. But at the end of that fit, the avaricious spirit will return with greater violence than ever. You must therefore guard against the virulence by making harvest of the fit. Do you understand ?\" \" Perfectly !\" answered the merchant. Then after a slight, thoughtful pause, he added: \" The cost of that powder?\" \" One dollar per grain.\" \" Do me up one hundred grains.\" \" Readily,\" said the poisoner. In a few moments the box was prepared and in the hands of the merchant. \"There is your money,\" said Clark, throwing him a bank bill to the amount.\u2014 'Now show me the door.\" CHAPTER VII. THE FIGHT. We must now change the scene for a few moments. In Orange-street, between Anthony and Leonard, 'and only a few doors from the south-west corner of the latter, there is a small frame building of two stories, on the opposite side of which runs a long, narrow alley, leading into a crazy building of the same height as tbat of the rookery fronting it. If you pass the latter in the evening, you will see a low, narrow strip of coarse red damask cur taining the glass portion of the door, and hear, from within, coarse, boisterous laughter, accompanied with snatches of lewd songs, and, particularly between nine o clock and midnight the heavy tramping and stepping of rude revellers in the enlightening strains of some old, cracked fiddle. It is one of the many low dens of vice, and shame, and guilt, and was in th"], [77, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 69 days of our story, the principal place of resort of the countless thieves, rowdies and vagabonds inhabitating the purlieus of the Five Points. The vile of both sexes meet there, and there hurry themselves into the charnal-trenches of Pot ters' Field, by rioting in the foul orgies peculiar to the denizens of that region. The bar-room, as it is called, is a low, narrow apartment, having a range of beer, and gin, and brandy barrels on one side, and a short, narrow counter on the other. Behind the counter is a deep shelf, on which are ranged a number of decanters and tumblers, and here and there a spoiled lemon. The counter itself is cleai ed, to enable the drinkers to devour the horrid poison served out to them by the bar-keeper with greater facility. On the walls, you will find lewd pictures to inflame and keep alive the passions, and here and there a coarse lithograph of some sea battle, together with a wretched likeness of Old Hickory. Seated on the barrels that we have mentioned, you will find some jolly sailor, with his arm ound the waist of a wretched, bloated, vulgar specimen of the female denizen of the Points. On the floor, sooting it merrily, a medley of whites and blacks, of all sizes and ages ; on a small cask a one-eyed fiddler, sawing away with might and main the enlivening air of \" the Money Muss,\" \"the Devil's Di earn,\" or \" You can't come it here, my dear.\" By passing from the bar-room into the apartment beyond, you will perceive a door leading into the yard, dividing the front from the back building. Crossing this yard towards the house, you come to a slight of steps, leading down into a long, broad basement hall, the entrance to which is a small narrow door, at the extreme end of the area. On the night of the 10th of April, in the year 1831, a big. burly wretch, dressed in a coarse dark overcoat, with laige metal buttons, a thick fur cap with a square peak, and trousers of common satinet, passed through the bar in the front building, out into the yard, and striding hastily down the stone steps of the back building, and walking along the area, rapped loudly at the small door. \" How now ?\" cried a loud, coarse voice within, \" who's there ?\" \" ' Tib's baby,' \" answered the stranger. \" Open !\" A sound like the drawing back of a shot-bolt was heard from within ; the next moment the door opened sufficiently wide to admit the new comer, and closed noiselessly immediately after his entrance. It was a strange scene. On either side of the vaBt subterranean hall were ranged a series of bunks, or oddly made up beds ; in one corner, at the farther end, a large, coarse, dirty blanket divided the bnnk of the chief from the eyes of the motley crew ; in the centre stood a long, broad table, on which was a goodly array of pipes, beer mugs, brandy bottles, platters of biscuit, cheese, slices of ham, beef, cold potatoes, and all the interesting et ceteras pertaining to a feast. Around this table were congregated some thirty or forty hard-looking wretches of both sexes, who were listening with ordinary attention to a song sung by a sprightly, tidy, reckless youth, who sat on the left, near the head of the table. SONG. Come all ye lads sad lassies, And listen unto me, While I tell you of a jolly cove Who always came to T. His name was Jimmy Barney, And in person he was fair, And the lassies how they lov'd him, 0, And of them he did take care. He gave them dibs and ribbons, And ho gave 'm liquor too, And so many were in love with him He knew not what to do."], [78, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 70 He picked the fairest charmer, And sat her on his knee. Saying, \" Poll, I'll stick to you, If you'll but stick to me.\" Says Poll, \" I'll stick to you, Jimmy, I'll stick to you like pe3s , If you'll give me ribbons plenty And lots of gin and grease.\" Says Jim, \" I'll do all that, my Poll, And all shall own you fair, And the gals shall do your washin'. And likewise comb your hair \u2014 \" The entrance of the new comer here interrupted the history of Jimmy Barney, and created quite a sensation. 'Hurrah for Jim Warner! hurrah for Gentleman Jim,\" shouted all, as the new comer made his appearance. Gentleman Jim went to his bunk, and, throwing off his coarse overcoat, cap' and trowsers, appeared in an entire new costume. He now displayed a blue coat, with gilt buttons, a buff vest, sky-blue trowsers, and patent leather boots. In height he might have been about five feet eleven inches, and presented a fine brilliant appearance. His features were remarkably well cut, and his appearance, when contrasted with that presented on his first entrance, was dashing and en gaging. \" So, here we are, boys !\" he exclaimed, advancing towards the table, and seat ing himself, like the vice-president of a free-and-easy, opposite the chairmau \u2014 \" here we are, boys, and with lots of the jolly to comfort us. Am I too late, Dick ?\" he added, addressing the chief, who sat at the head of the table. \" Not a bit of it,\" answered Dick Hazard, with a half surly grin ; \"anytime '11 do for us, I suppose. But 3 er might have come 'arlier.\" \"So I might, Dick, if I could,\" said Gentleman Jim, laughingly ; \"but the fact is, I've been on a trial, and couldn't get here any earlier. Am I too late for the election, boys.\" \" It aint begun yet,\" said Hazard, hastily, as if desirous of cutting off all fami liarity between Gentleman Jim and the \" boys.\" \" Plenty o' time for that.\" \" So there is,\" returned Gentleman Jim, good naturedly ; \" but for all that, Dick, when I ask the boys a question, I don't want you to interfere with their answering it.\" \" What d'yer mean ?\" growled Dick Hazard, bristling np. \"Just what I've said,\" answered Gentleman Jim, with a careless laugh.j The b'hoys and g'halls looked grave, for a fight was evidently brewing. More than this \u2014 the present was the night of election ; and the votes of the Owlers were to decide who the leader should be for the ensuing six months. Dick Hazard had thus far triumphed in every contest ; but his popularity wasevioently on the wane, and that of his rival, Gentleman Jim, beyond a peradventure, on the increase. This fact will explain the surliness of the chief towards that dashing \" gentleman.\" As to the feast or supper, that was given in honour of the victor, and in advance, to put the voters in good humour, the winning party to pay the bill. \" If so be yer wish to have a little handlin',\" cried Dick Hazard, rising with a deep frown, \" I'll accommodate yer !\" \" I don't wish it, Captain Dick,\" said Gentleman Jim, laughing; \"but if you are anxious to punish me, I'll give you an opportunity. Clear the table, and form a ring I\" he added, springing up, and hastily flinging off his blue coat. \"Since yer want it, yer shall have it !\" growled the Owler chief, leaving his chair \"Tib,\" he added, turning to that interesting lady, \"just hold my coat till this matter is settled, will yer?\" His rough face was pale with excitement ; his movements were nervous, for he was conscious that the victor would be voted into office by a triumphant majority."], [79, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 71 The table was moved towards the end of the hall iu a trice, and in less time than we have ta&en to tell it, the combat ints were in the ring, and ready for action. The necks of both were* bare, their sleeves rolled up to the shoulder. And indeed the muscular, well-formed arms of each presented a most magnificent sight. It would be difficult to guess, so well-matched were the parties, who would come off winner. A lamp hanging from the ceiling gave light for the affray. The countenance of Captain Dick was stern, ferocious, and from his hazel eyes there shot a dark, surly, malicious gleam, which told how bitter and merciless was the sentiment of his heart towards his opponent. As for Gentleman Jim, there was a smile on his lip, and a leer in his eye ; and it was easily seen that the contest was one having lor him more of fun than of anger. The antagonists spread themselves, and eyed each other coolly ; their breasts guarded, and their knuckles ready either for a \" ward\" or a \" smash.\" \" Look to your eye, Jim,\" cried one of the spectators. \" Sharpen his peepers, Dick,\" shouted another. At this moment Captain Dick let fly his right at the chin of his opponent. Gentleman Jim warded the blow, and, with a gay laugh, and lightning-like move ment; sent his right mauley on a flying visit to the knowledge-box ot his friend. A red stream immediately followed, together with a heavy grunt. \"First blood for Gentleman Jim,\" cried the little singer. A murmur went through the crowd. \" Wery nice, indeed,\" observed another. The combatants now sparred round each other, cautiously, when suddenly ano ther dash was made for the chin of Gentleman Jim ; that young man, however, avoided it, by throwing back his bead, and then, with a hasty spring, returned the compliment, by driving three quick, lightning-like blows at the mouth of Captain Dick. The immediate falling out of three pieces of broken teeth told plainly how effectually these \" fellers\" had carried out their mission. The face of Captain Dick was now perfectly black with rage and blood. A fiendish fire gleamed from his eyes, and with a quick spring, he rushed in upon his opponent, as if determined to crush him; but his blows were warded off with such dexterity, that none of them \" told ;\" while in return the mauleys of Gentleman Jim fell on him like hail. Thus far, Gentleman Jim had not received a single blow. The parties now sparred round each other, as if watching an opportunity for a \" seller\" that should settle the matter. \" Captain Dick is putty well pun'shed for a beginnin',\" observed some one very audibly. \" Gentleman Jim knows how to do it,\" added another. At this moment Gentleman Jim sent his right on a friendly visit to the chin of Captain Dick, and, as it was well aimed, and sent with considerable force, that gentleman measured his length with a grunt. \" Time,\" shouted the now excited Tib. \"Time it is !\" exclaimed Captain Dick, springing up. \" Yes, so it is,\" laughed Gentleman Jim, cracking his right peeper. With a loud, raging howl, Captain Dick now dashed forward, and fell upon his active opponent; both now closed, went down, and rolled over and under each other like two snakes in a death struggle. The spectators drew back to give them room. Gentleman Jim, with a light movement, succeeded in extricating himself from his opponent's grasp, and, dealing him three hasty \" feelers\" in his \" visual organs,\" sprang to his feet. \" Time !\" shouted Tib, who was now so fearfully pale that all shrank before her passionate glance. Up started the discomfited chief. His lips were swollen, his mouth, and nose"], [80, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 72 and cheeks covered with blood, and his eyes swollen, and almost leaping from their sockets. A dark line formed by the meeting of his gore-stained brows, ran across his forehead. \" Time !'\" repeated Tib, in a voice almost tantamount to a shriek. The combatants squarred again, and sparred nervously around the ring. \"If you would keep my favour, Dick Hazard,\" shouted Tib, foaming with pas sionate excitement, \" handle Gentleman Jim like a man.\" \"And Jim,\" cried another female, who looked as if she would like to have a round with mother Tib, \" pepper the big bully, or let me do it for you.\" \" Time enough for you to try, Poll,\" answered Gentleman Jim, laughing, \" when he has settled me.\"\" \"Give it to him under the chin, Jim,\" cried Poll, who was as deeply agitated as her lover was extraordinar ,ly calm. \"Silence !\" shouted mother Tib, with a fearful frown. \"Silence yourself, old muttou-head !\" retorted Pall, with a gleam of deGance. \",lf you'll wait till this business is settled, I'll open your ribs !\" \" Order \u2014 order \u2014 order !\" shouted all. As for Tib, so deep was she bent on the movements of the combatants she did not hear a word of the challenge of the pretty Poll. At this moment Gentleman Jim let drive his left for a feint, and his antagonist threw out to ward it off; Jian threw forth his right with such precision and force that Captain Dick reeled away to the right side, and fell with a heavy groan over a bunk. A loud shout from the females and the greater part of the men now drowned the raging shriek which Tib sent up at this light. \" Time I\" cried Tib, hoarsely, and running towards the fallen chief, \" Time, Dick !\" \" Time !\u2022' shouted all. \" Time, Dick !\" cried mother Tib, bonding over the captain. But Dick Hazard was speechless. All now gathered around, even Gentleman Jim, to assist the fallen Hazard, After a few minutes, he so far came to his senses as to open his eyes and look around ; but no sooner did his eyes light on his antagonist, than a fiendish scowl swept over his features. \"Come, come, Dick !'' cried Gentleman Jim, extending his hand, \"let us be friends.\" \" To h \u2014 11 with your friendship !\" growled the ruffian, through his closed teeth; \" you'll pay for this I\" \" The election !\" shouted a voice in the crowd, * it's gettin' late \u2014 let's in for the wotes!\" All now was animation. The miserable captain was left to himself; even Tib deserted him, to superintend the balloting. Finding himself deserted, Captain Dick made an effort, and raised himself sufficiently to sit up on the bunk, and watched the countenance of the Owlers. The singer took off his hat and placed it on the end of the long table. \" Now, my pals,\" he cried, looking round, \" you who wish to vote, walk up and deposit your tickets in this here ballot-box, 'cording to law. Walk up I walk up !\" \" Walk up ! walk up !\" shouted all, gathering round. \"I move that a hundkercher goes over that hat, that the wotes may be given without being seen !\" cried a voice. \" You hear, gen'lemen and ladies,\" cried the little singer, elevating his voice, '\u25a0' you hear the proposition. You as is in favour of it will signify the same by saying Ay.\" \"Ay !\" rang through the hall. \" Contrary, No,\" continued the singer. The voices were still. \" Very good !\" said the singer. \" Ths handkercher goes over th ; hat.'* And"], [81, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 73 he forthwith undid his neckcloth and drew it over the ballot-box. \" Now, let it be fully understood,\" continued the singer, \" that the straws is for Cap'n Dick, and the chips for Gentleman Jim.\" \" We understand it !\" shouted a laughing voice. \" That we does,\" added another, sagely. \" Walk up, walk up, gen'lemen and ladies,\" said the singer, \" walk up, and deposit your votes.\" r All now was breathless excitement. Captain Dick, as he sat on the bunk, watched the voters, as they went up successively, and shoved their closed hands under the handkerchief, with silent interest. Tib stood behind the singer, and fastened her keen green eyes on each voter, as if striving with the power of her glances, to intimidate the vote that she feared. As to the Gentleman Jim, he walked up and down tbe hall, smoking a long, clay pipe that he had lighted at the commencement of the balloting, teS No. 10."], [82, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 74 At last the votes were all cast. When the fact was known, all grouped anxiously around the singer. \" Stand out of the way, gen'Iemen and ladies !\" shouted that young gentleman. \" We want now to count the votes !\" All now drew back, except the ladies \u2014 they would not stir. The handkerchief was taken away, and amid universal silence, the singer put his hand into the hat, and pulled out a \u2014 chip. Again he put in his hand and pulled out a chip. The green eyes of mother Tib now gleamed like those of a serpent. Again went in the hand and out came a straw. Tib breathed, and Dick Hazard drew a long breath. Amid profound silence, the hand of the singer again entered the hat, and again drew forth a straw. An expression of malicious triumph now shone in the green eyes of Tib. Poll's heart sank, at least, fifty degrees. For the filth time the singer put in hi* hand, and drew forth a\u2014 straw. Poll now became perfectly pale, and the green eyes of mother Tib radiated like two emeralds when exposed to the sun. A savage, exulting smile played around the swollen lips of Captain Dick. Still ur> and down the hall, walked Gentleman Jim, smoking his pipe, with all the indifference and gravity of a Turk. Poll looked at him once or twice, with a sad eye ; but Jim did not notice it. Again went in the singer's hand, and drew forth a \u2014 chip. Tib's brow now displayed a slight shade, and Poll's a ray of hope. Again went in the hand, and out came a chip ; again, and again forth a chip ; and again, and as before, a chip ; and again, and again, and as before, a chip \u2014 a chip\u2014 nothing but chip, chip, chip. The forehead of mother Tib darkened, and her green eyes glittered, and her breathings were short, quick, and hot. Chip\u2014 chip \u2014 chip, came leaping forth one after the other, till the hat was exhausted and emptied. Then Tib, with her eyes glittering fearfully, and her thin face fearfully pale, turned around and flung a teirible look at Captain Dick. All who saw it felt their blood creep. At that same moment a screaming shout rose thundering around the walls and ceiling ; and one voice rose far above the rest. \"Jim!\" cried Poll, with a triumphant laugh, \"the chair is yours. Kiss me, Jim !\" After the scene that we have just narrated, when the excitement, revelry, and hilarity had passed away, the Owlers, male and female, betook themselves to rest ; the lights were put out, and all was, apparently, hushed in repose. But all slept not : Gentleman Jim and his chere ami Poll, as they lay on their bunk, curtained by a coarse blanket, spent two or three of the hours consecrated by their com panions to slumber, in whisperings. Nor were they the sole ones who slept not. The defeated captain and mother Tib kept vigils in that hall of darkness. More cunning than their antagonists, they carried on their conversation by low whispers in each others' ears. Anxious to learn the subject-matter of the new captain and bis companion, Tib left her bunk and crawled on her hands and knees close to that occupied by Gentleman Jim, and putting her cat-like ear to the edge of the blanket curtaining them, caught tverv word of their conversation. Having satisfied herself, she returned to her bunk and whispered in her companion's ear, \u2014 '.' He is going to crack the crib of one Alison Clark, in Leonard-street to-mor row night. Do you know that crib?\" \" Yes. What time is he goin' to crack it V \" About two o'clock, when all are asleep You must crack it before him.\"' \" How ?\" ' \" By going at twelve.\" \" Enough\u2014 I'll do it.\""], [83, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 75 CHAPTER VIII. THE DARK DEED. Let us now return to Alison Clark. Having secured the poisons, the merchant bent him homeward. Reaching his bouse, he retired to his room, which was on the second story fronting the street. The back chamber on the same floor, was that occupied by the ve'eran trader, Adam Brown. His wife having gone out on a visit, Alison Clark was alone. Reaching down a cigar from a tumbler on the mantel, he lit it, and seating him self in an easy chair before the grate, gave himself up to thought. As he pondered on his straitened circumstances, and on the possibility of sweeping aside all his troubles, and of reinstating himself in the proud position he held in the midst of his fellow traders, though the meins he contemplated to regain that position were such as would blast his reputation for ever, and even tuate in his death if known, still, though his cheek was of necessity pale, his nerves did not tremble. But one thing troubled this bad man \u2014 the occupation of Adam Brown. Since his establishment in the house of the merchant, be had never given his confidence to the family. Every day he left the house after breakfast, and returned to din ner and tea. as if engaged in some regular business. His habits were calm and regular, and to his meals and hours of slumber be was mechanical as the hours themselves. Every meal hour found him in his seat at the table, and nine o'clock of every evening found him slumbering on his bed. But not a word had he re vealed of how he spent his time ; and good breeding and policy on the part of the merchant and his wife prevented them from intruding on a confidence which the old trader did not seem inclined to volunteer himself. But of his wealth, Alison Clark had not the shadow of a doubt, and he resolved, as the reader has ere this doubtless suspected, to free himself ot his business embarrassments, by appropri ating that wealth to his own purpose. Nor was the task difficult. The powders he had purchased would accomplish it, without the spilling of blood. But there was an after thing to think of: how to shroud suspicion? How cover the old man's death! His wife, he knew, could not be trusted ; and his servants, of course, could not. How to dispose of them? In this mood he rose and paced the chamber. At this moment, a voice from the inner chamber fell on his ear. He ad vanced cautiously, on tip-toe, and placed his ear to the crevice of the door and listened. 'Twas the voice of the veteran trader engaged in prayer, previous to seeking his bed. Clark stole agitatedly away, and approached the toilet-table be tween the two windows. A half-opened note, directed to his wife, met his eye. Taking it up, he found it to be an invitation to a private fancy ball to be given the ensuing evening, at the house of an acquaintance. He now remembered that his wife had spoken to him concerning it a w ;ek or two back. \" And she wishes me to attend her,\" muttered the merchant, unconsciously crushing the note in his hand, \" as if I took delight in such scenes ! Pshaw !\" He paused and pondered. \" If she goes to the ball there will be one ear less to hearken to the old man's cries. Marxley, she says, will attend her, if I wish not to go. Marxley? Humph ! He is young, and, for all his follies, harmless. Charlotte appreciates him \u2014 as what woman of ordinary sense would not ? Yes, she may go, and the dandy shall gallanc her. My honour wil, run no risk with such a babe as Marxley. Yes, she shall go!\" He paused again, and his eyes wandered towards the door of the inner room. '"], [84, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 76 \"Tis but an effort, and the shackles now wound round me will break, fall, and disappear. Yet how to give him the powder ? Let me see\u2014 let me see !\" After a few moments, his countenance brightened up. \"I have it! When Charlotte is off to the ball, I will invite Brown to break a bottle of wine with me. Three grains of the powder dropped into his glass be fore I fill it\u2014 yes, yes, yes\u2014 that's it, that's it!\" CHAPTER IX. THE DISCOVERY. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon on the succeeding day. Ac am Brown stood in Hudson-street, near St. John's Park, gazing minutely at a fine range of brick mansions on the opposite side of the street. In his old fash ioned suit of brown \u2014 his hands meeting and resting behind him \u2014 his eyes count in\" the doors and windows, and stories of the opposite building \u2014 his benevolent features shining, and his benevolent eyes gleaming with some merry thought : thus he stood ; but for a time only ; for a thought, and, apparently a sad one, was entering his brain and crowding out the merry one ; and his features became grave. \" I have purchased four blocks,\" he muttered, \" and got my deeds, and had them properly recorded ; but this block \u2014 I suppose now they will want as much for it as I paid for the last two. No doubt they will \u2014 no doubt of it at all ! I shouldn't wonder if they were to demand a hundred thousand dollars for it \u2014 1 shouldn't won der at all ! Such prices as they ask for property now-a-days ! Such prices! But if I don't find my brother and his family ! What then ! What then is the use of all this property tbat I've been buying, if I don't find them ? My sister's son, Ali son Clark, will not want it all ; for he is already rich. I shall not want it, for I cannot live many years. Some one must have it. If I find my brother and his family, it will be a great benefit to them. If I don't find them, I don't know what I shall do\u2014 I really don't.\" And so, all unconsciously, the veteran walked on till he came to Canal-street. \" If I could but find my brother Jack, now ; or his family \u2014 for Jack must have married \u2014 he was one of the kind \u2014 it would be such a consolation to me ; yes it would ! \" And thus, he slowly, thoughtfully, turned the corner and proceeded up the street, towards Broadway. \"Alison don't even suspect me!\" ruminated the veteran, with a quiet chuckle ; \" he takes me in his house \u2014 I eat at the table with him \u2014 I sleep on the same floor with him ; and he don't even suspect me ! Oh ! how he'll be surprised when he comes to read my will, and find that Adam Brown is Adam Brown Mansfield, his mo ther's own brother. Ha ! ha ! ha ! There'll be such fun then ! The runaway boy who} left off his family name the more securely to cross the sea, bow his will will astonish 'em ! And they don't know him and they won't know him till he finds his brother Jack ! Ha ! ha ! ha !\" By this time he had reached Chapel-street; and while crossing, the sound of a fiddle, accompanied by a girlish voice, caused him to turn his head to the right, and there he saw a small crowd. \" Some poor things,\" he muttered, \" going from door to door, and singing for a livelihood. I must give them something \u2014 yes, I must \u2014 I must!\" And he turned and proceeded towards the crowd. It was a touching sight that encountered the old man's eyes. -Before the door of a fruit shop, and surrounded by a crowd of all sorts, sizes, and colours, were a little band of three, performing the old familiar melody of \" Home, sweet home,'"], [85, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 77 viz., a blind youth, and his two sisters ; the eldest accompanying him with hjr sad, plaintive voice ; the younger thrumming, vacantly, on a small tambourine and halting at times in the midst of the melody, and holding out her instrument for pence, and then drawing it back agaiu, and thrumming away as before, sadly out of time and tune. So earnest and affecting was the sight, even the little children who were looking on, as they beheld the mechanical movements of ihe insane girl, and the blind orbs of the thin, wan youth, and the feeble frame, nervous lip, pale brow, colour less cheeks and downcast eyes of the elder sister, ceased their jocund mirth, and drawing their little at ma across their childish eyes, vept \u2014 the holy tribute of a tear. And sadly seemed the wanderers in want of bread and of the very thing of which their tender voices sung \u2014 a home ! Aye, and of raiment, too : for their frail, feeble arms, though panoplied in clean and tidy gear, looked as if one strong gust of the strong, sweeping winds would leave them garmentless and nude. The thin frocks covering the spare limbs of the pale, wan sisters, and the light jacket and thin trow- sers and straw hat of the youth, belonged to the warm days of summer, not to the chilly days of spring. Stern indeed must have been the poverty, and strong the persecution, that drove these tender ones abroad, to win raiment, bread, and the means of shelter from a cold, pitiless world ! And as the veteran looked on this pity-drawing sight, as he beheld the mechani- cal movements of the insane girl, his hand drove all unconsciously into the depths of his pocket, and, pulling forth two or three gold pieces, he walked around the crowd, towards the tamborine thrummer, and watching an opportunity when;the girl again held out her instrument, threw in the money. This feat accomplished, he made his way into the fruit-shop, and addressing himself to the fruiterer, asked if he would permit him to invite the lonely wanderers into his shop. The fruiterer re- plying in the affirmative, the old man returned to the door, and, waiting till the melody was finished, then beckoned to the eldest of the trio, and invited her into the fruitery. Having gained the consent of the shop -keeper, Adam Brown led the wanderers into a small room, opening from the shop, and then, courteously, pointed them to seats. At a word from Marian \u2014 for she it was \u2014 the blind boy and his idiot sister seated themselves, in wonder and in silence. Aud now the old veteran questioned Marian, and learned the whole of her sad history; the early death of her mother: the prostration in business, the. after sickness and eventual death of her father; of her extreme poverty; of the myste- rious disappearance of the vest on which she had bee* employed at the moment of her father's death ; of her inability to find or make it good to her employer ; of her being thrown out of employ on that account ; of her inability to procuie work for want of references ; of the dreadful fate staring her and her brother and sister in the face ; of their ejectment from their home by their landlord ; of their de- spair ; how their minds had been made up to plunge into the North River, and. by dying, end their misery ; how, at that critical moment, they encountered a young man, bearing all the outward marks of poverty, his frame spare, his features thin, his clothes threadbare, bat who kindly gave them money, and, after hearing their sad tale, bade them be of good cheer, and to think of lite, not death ; how he pro cared them a small room in a house in Read-street, paid the rent himself, and after counselling to the best of his ability, at last procured them a fiddle, on which the blind boy learned to play, and a tamborine, on which the idiot girl learned to thrum ; and how, at last, after sternly practising night and day, the blind boy could play on the fiddle, the idiot girl thrum the tamborine, and Marian herself sing passably ; how the feeble state of his health, at times kept their protector away ; and how, at last, they resolved, rather than be any longer pensioners on his slender purse, to wander round the city, and with their fiddle, tamborine, and songs gain what they could to save themselves from famine and from death, M What is the name of this young man J\" said Adam Brown. \""], [86, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 78 \" Of our protector 1\" *\u2022 Yes.\" \" Lewis Hudson,\" said Marian. Adam Brown reflected a moment. \"Yes, yes, I remember now,\" said he. He is a clerk in the store of Alison Clark, is he not, young lady ?\" ' Yes, sir,\" said Marian. \u2022' Yon know him then ?\" \" Not personally, my dear young lady,\" answered the veteran ; \" but I shall ioon. But we must have no more of this. Let us go home, right off.\" 4 ' Sir?\" said Marian, colouring. \u2022' I say we must have no more of this,\" repeated Adam Brown ; \" we must go right home \u2014 yes, right off!\" And, for the twentieth time since they had entered the fruiterer's, the veteran regaled himself with a huge pinch of Maccaboy, and ran his handkerchief across his nose right lustily. \" Wheredo you live?\" he added. \" In Read-street, sir,\" answered Marian, not knowing what to make of it, \" Let us go then right off. Don't speak tome, young lady \u2014 don't speak tome till wegetthere. Here is my arm. Your brother and sister will follow us. Take my arm.\" All rose flusteringly, and entered the shop. \" I am very much obliged to you, sir, for the use of your room,\" said Adam Brown, to the shop-keeper ; \"I am very much obliged to you, sir. That will vray for it.\" And he again flung a fifty-cent piece upon the counter. It was a curious and affecting sight to see that small party as they proceeded to- vards Read-street \u2014 Marian leaning on the old man's arm, and the blind boy and his insane sister following them, hand in hand, like little children. They reached the house, and climbing up to the fourth story, Marian opened the \u25a0loor of a small apartment, lighted by one window that looked out upon the yard. It was a Wretched dirty building ; and the old man thought as he ascended that he was digging his way skyward, through layers of mud and filth. The orphans' room wassmalland narrow; ahalf barrel, turned head upward, fora table ; two chairs, a straw tick in one corner, a small sheet iron stove, standing on four frail legs, and a coffee-pot, comprised its all. Adam Brown was shocked ; never before had he seen such stern proofs of poverty. Marian seated herself on a chair ; the blind boy and the idiot girl sat them down side by side, on the straw tick. Adam Brown taking the remaining chair, caused Marian to tell_, her story over again; and when she had done, be asked her father's name. \"John Mansfield,\" answered Marian. A cold thrill darted through the veteran's veins at the reply. \" Had he ahrother, Miss Marian ?\" he cried, starting up; \" had he a brother Miss Marian, who had run away.\" \" He had, sir \u2014 he often spoke of him, and with tears.\" \"His name, Marian !\" demanded the agitated veteran ; \" what was his brother's tame f\" \" Adam Brown Mansfield,'' replied Marian. The veteran gave a low groan. ''Are you ill, sir ?\"said Marian, starting up. \" You inust stay here no longer,\" cried Adam Brown, with emotion :\" you must stay here no longer, my dear young friends, you really mustn't ! You must \"O away from here \u2014 right off\u2014 yes, you must 1'' Marian looked at him in amazement. The blind boy uttered a cry.\u2014\" What is the matter, Marian ? Are we to be again thrown out into the cold streets ?\" \"This is very funny!\" said the idiot girl, with a vacant laugh. \" You cannot go to my house, my dear friends,\" continued Adam Brown, in Teat perturbation, \"because I am not sure that the gentleman with whom I .am"], [87, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND.\" 79 staying would like it; but ycu must go somew licit \u2014 \\es, you n.utt. But where \" He paused nervously, and fidgetted round the room like one half-demented. \" What a funny man !\" exclaimed the idiot girl, with a wild laugh. \" I have it,\" exclaimed Adam Brown. \"I have it now 1 Where can we get a carriage? Who lives below, Marian?\" \" I don't know, sir ; there are five families down stairs, and we are not acquainted.\" y '* A noise, like some one walking, was heard in the room fronting the street. \" Who lives in there, Marian ?\" said the old man, pointing. Marian blushed. \" You do not answer, Marian ?\" said Adam Brown. \"A young painter, sir, named Eugene Lincoln.\" \"I'll call him,\" said the veteran, quitting the room. Going out on the landing, he approached and knocked at the door of the painter. It was opened by the young man himself. Through the door Adam Brown caught a slight glance of a few landscapes and pictures \u2014 a half-fiuisheii portrait, bearing a strong resemblance to Marian, hung upon an easel, but the apartment was wretchedly destitute of comforts or con veniences. The appearance of the painter was engaging ; but his sunken eye, haggard cheek, wasted frame, and miserable clothes, told the enthusiastic spirit of his soul, and the stern battle in which he was engaged with Fate. \" I wish to convey some friends of mine living in the next room to an hotel,\" began the veteran ; \"will you oblige me, sir, by calling me a carriage?'* \"With pleasure, sir,\" answered the young painter, colouring. I: \"Thank you, sir \u2014 you will do me a great favour.\" \" Don't mention it,\" said the painter hastily. In a lew moments he dashed down the crazy stairs, and flew up the street. \" He must be very poor,\" muttered the veteran. \" I'll venture into his room and take a peep.\" The walls were literally lined with sketches of every description. All told of talent, many of genius. But a miserable cot in one corner, and a broken loaf, a few scraps of cheese, and a broken pitcher resting on a small oblong table, which served for the double purpose of table and writing desk, announced the miserable reward of talent and genius. Seeing a few sheets of writing paper, a small bottle, and a pen on the back part of the table, he drew them towards him, and wrote, \u2014 \" Mr. Lincoln, \u2014 excuse the freedom I have taken in examining your apartment in your absence. As you seem in difficulties, I lend you ten eagles, to be returned to me when you attain eminence and wealth. \" Yours, \" Adam Brown.\" And depositing ten gold pieces on the table beside the letter, he left the room. At the door he encountered the painter, who was almost breathless. \"The carnage is at the door, sir,\" said Eugene Lincoln. \"I am very much obliged to you, I am indeed, sir,\" returned the veteran. \"I have been looking at your pictures, sir, and predict your fame and wealth. They are fine, sir\u2014 very fine, indeed. I shall take the liberty of calling upon ycu at some future time, sir. Thank you, sir. Good-bye, sir!\" The painter blushed, stammered a few words, and entered his studio. \" Come, roy children,\" said Adam Brown, turning to the orphans, \" the carriage is at the door. Take my arm, Marian.'' And the four descended, and entered the carriage standing at the door. \" Where to, sir ?\" said the driver. \" The City Hotel,\" answered Adam Brown. The driver mounted his seat, cracked his whip, and the carriage swept away. From his window Eugene Lincoln beheld the party roll from his tear bedewed eyes. Turning away from the window, his eye fell accidentally on the letter, and then on the gold pieces beside him. Seizing the former, he ran his eyes ever th*"], [88, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 80 lines, and taking the gold up in his nervous grasp, he burst out into a fit of laughter mingled with tears. \" Saved ! saved !\" he exclaimed wildly. \" Now for a supper !\" The poor enthusiast had been saved from another night of hunger !\" Reaching the City Hotel, Adam Brown, leaving his companions, entered the bar-room ; where, after a few werds with the proprietor, he completed the necessary arrangements, and the orphans were shown to an apartment. A piece of money enlisted the services of one of the waiters, who darted off, and soon returned with a tailor bearing an armful of clothes. The blind boy was measured, and two or three 3uits answering the measure being found, they were given to Marian for her brother, and the tailor, having received nis money bowed himself out of the apart ment. Scarcely had he gone, when an elderly female, preceded by a number of waiters bearing bandboxes, entered. As the latter contained clothing for the females, Adam Brown retired temporarily, to give Marian and her idiot sister time to dress. When he Teturned, so great was the change in the appearance of the orphans they could hardly be rscognised. The bill being settled, the dressmaker took her leave, and the orphans and their protector were left alone. It being now hard on to nine o'clock, supper was ordered up, and Adam Brown sat down with the orphans, and with them enjoyed the meal. The repast over, the veteran embraced them successfully, and promising to call early the following morning, took his leave amid sobs and tears of joy. Descend ing to the bar-room, he again saw the proprietor, and, after making the necessary arrangements for the comfort of his newly-discovered relative?, hastened home, little dreaming of what was to befal him there. CHAPTER X. THE MURDER. On reaching home, Adam Brown found Alison Clark alone ; his wife having gone to a fancy ball, accompanied by young Marxley. Excusing himself for his tard'iness, he joyfully accepted an invitation from the young merchant to spend an hour with him in his room, over a bottle of choice Ma deira and a bunch of pure Havanas. \"But how is this, Mr. Clark?\" said Adam, earnestly; \"you look pale. Jealous \u2014 eh V' \" Of what should I be jealous i\" returned Clarke, with a forced laugh. \" Your wife goes to a ball with a young man\u2014 that young man is not her hus band,\" continued Adam Brown. \" But that young man is Frederick Augustus Marxley,\" replied Clark, laughing. \" I'd trust my wife with him as soon as I'd trust my grandmother. He is one of those amiable little walking-sticks whom all appreciate because he is convenient. But as to danger \u2014 ha! ha! ha!\" \" You do not fear him, then .'* \" With ordinary men I should hesitate to trust her ; but with young Marxley she is perfectly safe. She wished to go, and as I preferred remaining at home, some one was needed to gallant her, direct the coachman, and pick up her handker chief when she should drop it. For such services, who so fitting and trust worthy as Frederick Augustus Marxley }\" \"The colour has now returned to your cheek,\" observed the veteran, \"so here s to your health ! ' And he emptied his wine-glass. and\" he' muttered,- SS6d \u00b0W *' *\"*\" \u00b0' *' *\u00bb* merchant at this si8\u00bb\". \"He has drunk it\u2014 all works well !\" \"Capital Madeira that,\" said the old veteran, putting down hit glass, and taking up and lighting a cigar. 6 '"], [89, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 81 So, for three quarters of an hour passed their convivial mirth ; at the end of which time, the veteran began to display a strong disposition for slumber ; and bidding his companion good night, he retired with uncertain steps to his room where, after muttering a hasty prayer, he threw himself all unconsciously, and r'.'j ,undressin\u00a7'' uP\u00b0n his bed. In a few minutes, the merchant opened the folding-doors carefully, and listened. \" Yes, he sleeps !\" he muttered ; \" and ere many minutes his sleep shall be eternal.\" He paused a moment or two; drew open still wider the folding-doors, and gazed with straining eyes upon the sleeper. So intent was his mind upon the deed, he noticed not that the window nearest the fireplace was uncurtained ; nor did he perceive, in the darkness without the sill, that a human eye was watching all his movements. Advancing cautiously toward the bed, he listened to catch the breathings of the sleeper, but all was silence. Running bis hand carefully into the pockets of ths sleeper's clothes, he drew forth at last a key, and, with stealthy, trembling steps, advanced toward a large-sized leathern trunk ; inserting No. 11."], [90, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. \u25a0t the key and turning the lock, lie began to ransack the apartments of the trunk for the money be had darkened his soul for ever to obtain. Hearing a step on the landing without, he hastily dropped the lid and darted precipitately back into bis own room. His eyes were now strained with excitement, his features pale and livid, and his nerves tremulous. Filling a wine glass, he drained it at a swallow to restore the steadiness of his nerves. Creeping on tip-toe to the door, he placed his ear to the key-hole ; hearing no sound, he returned to the table and filling and draining another glass, he again stole on tip-toe into the back chamber. But with all his struggles he could not sufficiently calm his nerves to proceed with the robbery. Despite of himself, strange noises tingled in his ear, and startled his nerves ; and, do what he could, his staring eyes kept wandering every moment to the body on the bed \u2014 that silent witness of his guilt ! The small clock in the chamber now, with measured stroke and slow, tolled the hour of twelve. As the strokes vibrated on the air, the agitation of the murderer continued to increase, till he found it impossible to remain in the same apartment with his victim ; and crawling back into his own room, he flung himself into his easy chair in a state of mind bordering on phrenzy. Glass after glass of maderia he poured out and swallowed, to compose the terrible power which had possession of his system. Having succeeded to a certain extent, he rose, and taking down his hat and cloak, threw them on, and then crept stealthily from the room. At the same moment, a figure that had been peeping through the window of the inner chamber, and watching all his movements, silently disappeared. It was pitch dark without, as the murderer opened the hall door to admit himself into the street ; not a star illumined the black funereal firmament ; not a lamp was to be seen to relieve the midnight gloom ; not a sound, so heavy was the air, fell on the watchful ear. The merchant wrapped in his long, black cloak, descended the steps, and strode hastily up the street toward Broadway, closely followed by a tall figure that had turned the corner of Church street as he had opened bis door. Reaching Broadway, the merchant walked on till became to Anthony street; turning to the left, he proceeded down that street of shame, and crime and filth, till he reached Centre ; turning again to the left, he strode on till be came to a small two story building; ascending the wooden stoop'fronting it, he pulled 'a small hell handle. In a few minutes the door was cautiously opened, and a man, with a most villanous countenance, which was reflected by a night lamp that he held in his left hand, demanded \u2014 \"Who's there?\" \" One who wants your services,\" replied the merchant huskily \"At this hour of the night ?\" \" Aie you not Owen Omey, the undertaker?'' \" I am sir,\" said the undertaker. \"Then my coming at this hour must not surprise you !\" said the merchant significantly. \" Come in\u2014 come in,\" said the undertaker, hastily. The merchant entered ; behind him, hidden by his cloak, crept a figuie. \" Follow me,\" said the \"undertaker, hastily, leading the way into a large \\oom filled with upright coffins. Setting down the lamp on a coffin that lay extended on two stools in the centre of the wareroom, the undertaker demanded his visitor's buisness. The figure that had followed the merchant, now crouched in the nitty with his ear on the threshold of the door of the wareroom, so that he heard every word mat passed. \" Owen Omey,\" began the merchant, \"is acquainted with Signor Franroni \u00bb\" \"He is,\" said the coffin-maker. \" What then ?\" \" Like his friend Signor Franzoni, Owen Omey loves money ?\" 4 ' He does,\" answered the coffin-maker, with a hideous grin. \" An aged man has to-night paid the debt of time,\" pursued the merchant,"], [91, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 83 \" I understand,\" said the coffin-maker. \"His friends \u2014 that is, the sow that know him \u2014 think him gone on a journey; or rather, they will think so to-morrow morning,\" added the merchant, significantly. \" I see\u2014 I see,\" said the coffin-maker, eyeing his companion searchingly. \" Owen Orney can earn five hundred dollars by anticipating and performing my wishes,\" said the merchant. \" I know\u2014 I know,\" replied the coffin-maker, thoughtfully. \"I am thinking where I can put him.\" \"The night wears, Owen Orney, and the body is yet to be coffined,\" said the merchant, after a short pause. \" I have it now \u2014 I have it now,\" exclaimed the coffin-maker. \" Do you wish to know where I intend to put him ?\" \" No,\" answered the merchant: \" I wish him to be entombed \u2014 farther than that I wish no knowledge.\" \" 1 understand,\" said the coffin-maker, significantly; and pulling the tassel of a cord which hung suspended from the ceiling, a trap in the floor was shoved back, and a human head appeared. So sudden was this movement, that the merchant started as if the tenant of some grave had suddenly appeared before him. \"Get the night carriage ready on the walk,\" said the coffin-maker, addressing the man in the trap ; \" and see that the wheels elon't creak.\" \" Aye, aye, sir,\" responded the man disappearing : the next moment the trap elosed. \" The size of the body?\" added the coffin-maker, turning to his visitor. \" He is a small-sized man : I do not know his precise height,\" answered the merchant. \" I am five feet nine,\" said the coffin-maker ; \" is he taller than me ?\" \" Not so tall by an inch, I should think,\" replied the merchant. \"Is he stout?\" \" I should say two sizes stouter than yourself.\" \" Very well,\" returned Owen Orney, looking around at the coffins. \" Here is one will sit him. It will cost you fifty dollars, which together with the risk and trouble of conveying him to the vault will come to five hundred and fifty dollars \u2014 not a cent less. Does that content you ?\" he added, maliciously. \" It does,\" answered the merchant, biting his lips. \"Very good,\" said the coffin-maker, returning to, and again pulling the bell-rope. The trap again opened ; the head appeared as before. \" Is the black blanket on the carriage ?\" demanded the coffin-maker. \" Aye, aye, sir.\" \" Then put this on with it,\" said the undertaker, taking down the coffin he had chosen, and shoving it through the trap. '\u25a0 Aye, aye, sir.\" And as the coffin disappeared, the trap again closed. \" Wait a moment till I get my keys and rig myself,\" said the coffin maker. The merchant nodded, and Owen Orney quitted the room. Hearing his coming, the figure in the entry sprung to his feet, and darted towards the door. Suspect ing nothing, the coffin-maker did not turn his head in that direction, but pursued his way up stairs. The figure, satisfied that he had overheard all that was neces sary for his purpose, took this opportunity to cautiously unfasten the door, and let himself into the street. This he accomplished so noiselessly, that two of the coffin-maker's men who were standing with their night carriage on the walk, wait ing for the coming of their master, neither saw nor heard him. Stealing onward noiselessly, he took his stand at the corner, ready to follow the party when they should set out."], [92, "84 THE JAD VENTURES OF A VAGABOND. CHAPTER XI. JHE MIDNIGHT BURIAL. In a few minutes the coffin-maker was ready, and the party moved on towards Leonard street, headed by the merchant and Owen Orney. The night carriage was along, low, black vehicle, with four small wide wheels covered with India rubber, to deaden the sound of their rolling. On the oblong board crossing the axletrees, the coffin was tightly strapped, and covered with a black cloth. The two assistants of the coffin-maker, their feet encased in India rubber shoes, so as to avoid all noise, dragged this vehicle with two short ropes. fastened to the front axletree ; and as they moved onward with their noiseless burden, they seemed like spirits let loose from hell to prey upon mankind. Reaching the merchant's house, Clark cautiously opened the door, and led the way up stairs, followed by Owen Orney and one of his men bearing the coffin ; while the other assistant remained below to watch and keep guard over the carriage. The first sight the coffin-maker beheld on entering the veteran's chamber, was the uncurtained window ; and seizing the merchant by the arm, be quickly pointed out the oversight. Clark turned pale, and hastily dropped the curtain. The coffin was then placed on three chairs, and the body of Adam Brown lifted from the bed, by Owen Orney and his assistant, and placed in it ; but as the coffin was one size too narrow, the body had to be forced in, which was done, and the lid then placed over the top and screwed down. Everything now being ready, the undertaker and his assistant lifted the coffin between them, and, with as little noise as possible, conveyed it down stairs. The merchant accompanied them to the door, and when he saw the coffin lashed to the night carriage, he paid the coffin-maker the stipulated price, and then, with re morse eating into his vitals, returned to his room. \" Where now, sir ?\" said one of the assistants, in a low voice. \"To the vault of Old Trinity,\" returned Owen Orney. And leading the way, the coffin-maker was followed by the night carriage and corpse. As each of the party wore India rubber shoes, and as the wheels of the vehicle \u2014 as we have already mentioned \u2014 were lined with the same sound-killing material, the coffin-maker and his men, and that lonely death-car, strode over the pave of Broadway like spectres belonging to the night gloom. Reaching the vast churchyard of Old Trinity, situated on Broadway opposite Wall street, the night carriage stopped ; and, while his assistants unlashed the coffin from the vehicle, Owen Ornay leapt over into the churchyard. Reaching the coffin and resting it on the railing, the undertaker, holding it by the foot, sus tained it in that position till his men leapt over and released him. \"Merrick,\" said the coffin-maker, \"you take hold of the foot, and, as it is so d \u2014 d dark, carry one end of this string between your teeth, while I, who know every inch of this old place, guide you.\" \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Merrick. in a low voice. And grasping the other end of the cord in his left hand, the coffin-maker led the way to the south-west side of the church, till he came to a door leading to the vault. \u00b0 \"Set down the body,\" said the coffin-maker, in a whisper, \"and not a word. not a breath !\" ' Taking a bunch of keys from his girdle, Owen Orney after a time, succeeded in opening the padlock, and taking it from the staple, raised the door. \" When I hold up the lantern,\" said Owen Orney, drawing a small one from under his cloak, \" enter with the coffin ; and be careful you don't slip, for the steps are loose broken.''"], [93, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 85 \" Aye, aye, sir,\" answered the assistant, simultaneously, in a whisper. Feeling his way cautiously down the broken steps, the coffin-maker reached the earthly floor of the lightless, gloomy vault ; when, taking a small circular lucifer box from his coat, he separated thb two parts, and, taking a match from one chamber he drew the cork of a small bottle containing the phosphor, and plunging in the match, drew it forth the next moment flaming. Applying it to the wick of the lantern, he paused till it burned freely, and then, holding it up, ex claimed, \u2014 \" Now !\" The next moment the two assistants, came cautiously down the crazy, brown stone steps, carrying the coffin between them as best they could. Reaching the earthy floor of the deep vault, they set it down to rest, while the coffin-maker went forward to explore the vault, and find a spot in which to lay the burden. Watching his opportunity, when the undertaker had gone forward with the light, the figure that had followed them, stole noiselessly down the steps, and crouching in a corner behind the coffin-maker's assistants, had an opportunity to behold, un seen, the extraordinary scene that followed. A pile of old coffins standing near the wall in the left hand corner, with a small embankment of dust, earth and coffin fragments, caught Owen Orney 's eye, and fuming to his assistants, he cried out \u2014 \" Turn away that dirt \u2014 take down those coffins, and place him,\" pointing to the victim, \" under them all. Then place them in the same order in which they now are, and return this dirt-pile in the condition it now stands. That done, hasten home as soon as your legs cm carry you.\" With this order, the coffin-maker put down his lantern, and, drawing his cloak close about him, quitted the vault and returned lo his warehouse, muttering \u2014 \" A good night's job !\" Merrick and Tom Williams \u2014 the two assistants \u2014 now raised the coffin and bore it towards the designated spot. Resting it on the ground, awhile, Tom Williams took up the lantern and began searching for a spade or shovel, or something to remove the dirt from the base of the coffin pile. Having succeeded in find ing a spade, he returned_and began to remove the earth, when Merrick interrupted him. \" I say, Tom, seein' as how the old feller was cribbed so sudden, what do you say to searchin' him ?\" \u2022 \"What d'yer mean?\" said his companion. \"Why, you see, the chap wot settled him is one of 'em. Crickee ! you oughter have seen his crib. Sich silks and satins and carpets\u2014 yer would'nt have believed it!\" \" Was they so wery nice ?\" asked his companion. \" Amazin' !\" returned Merrick, \" Well a8 I was a-sayin' the feller wotcrbbed him, was mighty pale and narvous. I don't believe he had the pluck to search his pockets arter he'd settled him !\" \" No ?\" \"If I do, blow me! What say you to inspectin' him, afore we do him up?\" \" Tin willin' \" replied Williams, dropping the spade. \" Got the screw driver?\" \" 1 kinder reckon I have,\" said Merrick, drawing a small one from his pocket \" You see It arn't none too big to carry about me, 'speshly in jobs like this. Jest you hold the light, while I take off the kiver.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Williams, taking the lantern. Bending over the coffin, Merrick proceeded with his professional coolness to unscrew the lid ; having accomplished it, he laid it down softly beside the coffin, and plunged his hand into the pockets of the vest: a low sigh startled him. \" What's that ?\" he cried, looking terror-struck at his companion, \" Didn't you hear it?\" ,, , , ,,, \u00ab What ?\" said Williams, breathlessly."], [94, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 86 \" I thought he breathed,\" said Merrick. \" Gammon !\" cried Tom Williams. \" Hold the light and I'll attend to him!\" , ,, .... nun : 1 #.-|l \" No, you don't !\" returned Merrick, recovering his courage. \" Just hold on till 1 penetrate his trowsers.\" But to do this was a matter of some difficulty ; for the body having been pressed into the coffin, thejsides of the pantaloons were wedged in between the body and the wood. \" Rip 'em,\" suggested Tom Williams. \" I arn't got no knife,\" said the other, with an oath. \" Here's mine,\" said Williams, drawing one from his pocket. Merrick opened it hastily, and ran the long, sharp blade into the cloth near the pockets ; this he did so awkwardly, that the knife entered the flesh, and a crimson stream immediately spurted/rem the wound ; at the same moment, a cry of agony burst from the lips of the body ; with the cry, the eyes of the old man opened, and, giving a hasty spring, he started up from his coffin. Merrick uttered a yell of terror, and flew from'the vault, up the crazy stairs, into the church-yard, and, coming to the fence cleared it with a bound, and darted up the street like one pursued by a legion of spectres. - The more phlegmatic Williams, stared wildly at the risen body, and dropping the lantern, gave a low groan, and fell forward on his face in a state of insensibility. On rising and looking around him, Adam Brown could scarcely credit his sight. The long, dark, vault \u2014 the gloomy piles of decayed coffins, almost inky-black with age \u2014 the brown earth and stray bones and skulls \u2014 the fragments of coffins \u2014 the dead silence \u2014 the fresh coffin from which he had risen \u2014 the pale and dingy frag ments of shrouds hanging from and visible through the rat-eaten holes and cracks of the numerous coffins rising between him and the walls \u2014 the dim light of the fallen lantern \u2014 the slight, creeping steps of the numerous rats, as they darted over the brown, earthy floor, or crept from coffin to coffin in quest of their loathsome food \u2014 the memory of the flying figure that met his startled eyes on waking \u2014 the sight of the low, staring vulgar ruffian that lay before him \u2014 all this confused and startled him. The pain in his side,\" caused by the knife as it penetrated his flesh, and the blood now slowly oozing from it, restored the clearness of his naturally self-possesed mind, while the pain almost agonised him. Taking the knife, the blade of which gleamed bmeath the dim light of the lantern, he examined it thoughtfully for a few moments, then ran it into the white lining of the coffin from which he had so lately risen, and severing a piece half a yard in length, folded and clapped it to his wounded side to stay the effusion of blood. Then taking up the lantern, he passed onward through the vault, in search of an avenue by which to escape. Reaching the entrance at last, he clambered with difficulty up the broken steps, and then strove to learn where he was. *But the night being so dark, he could see nothing, save the stone path leading towards the facade of the church. Holding the light before him, he walked cautiously onward, and had the gratification in a few minutes of finding himself at the gate. With great difficulty he clambered over, and walked onward, lured by the pale light of a large night-lamp hanging in front of a large building. To his great joy, he recognised the building, as the City Hotel ; and as the entrance to the hall leading to the bar was still lighted, he passed in, and opening the door of the bar-room, presented himself to the bar-keeper. When the astonishment of the latter, at the sight of the strange vi sitant, had passed away, Adam Brown demanded a room, and, bidding the bar-keep er to send for a physician to bind and dress his wound, followed the waiter that had been summoned, and ascended to a neatly furnished chamber in the rear pail of the third story. Scarcely had Adam Brown quitted the vault when the figure, that we have so fre quently alluded to, stole from his place of concealment, and making his way through the churchyard, sprang over the paling, and hurried up Broadway. Reaching An thony-street, he turned down towards the Five Points, aud.arrivingat Orange-street turned to the left till he came to a low building a short distance from Leonard"], [95, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 87 street. Revelry was goin^ on within ; loud laughing, ribald jests, dancing, and the mirth. inspiring tones of a fiddle formed a noisome din. \" Make way for gentleman Jim !\" cried a number of male and fecale bacchanals as he opened the door and mingled with the crew. \" Come, Jim, let's have a dance !'' cried a female rising from a beer-barrel, and advancing towards him. \" So be it, Poll !\" answered Gentleman Jim, leading her off; and, for a few minutes, in the excitement, of the jig, the Owler chief forgot the scene he had just witnessed in the vault of old Trinity. When the dance was over, Jim led Poll from the party, and they entered the subterranean hall in the rear building. \" Where is Dick Hazard?\" said Gentleman Jim, anxiously. \" There, there,\" said Poll, pointing to the bunk. Jim looked, and beheld Dick Hazard stretched out in heavy slumber, upon his rude bed, his face bandaged and plastered ; the effects of the elecli n of the preceding evening- \" Where's Tib ?\" said Jim, uneasily. \" Off somewhere,\" answered Poll. \" What luck, Jim ?\" \" None as yet,'' he replied, in a low voice. \" Who's here?\" \" No one, except Hazard. But what's the matter Jim \u2014 you ain't hurt ?'' she add ed, anxiously. *' Not a bit \u2014 not a bit, Poll,\" answered the other, cheerfully. \" Let's go tojbed ; \u2014 I want to talk to you in whispers.\" \" What is't Jim ?\" \" To bed first\u2014 to bed, to bed, Poll.\" \" Well, what is it Jim?\" \" How would you like to go Mexico, Poll ?\" \" You're joking Jim ?\" *' Not a bit of it I've got an offer.\" \" From whom?\" \" You know Aaron Burlock ?\" \" Yes.\" '\u2022 He's fitting out an expedition to invade Mexico ; the greatest men of the day are in it ; its going to be a great affair.\" \" Well Jim ?\" \" I think of going.\" \" You Jim ?\" \"Yes\u2014 I'm to \\he captain''; then a colonel ; then a major; and soon, till I get to be a general.''? \" You're joking, Jim '.'' \" Not a bit of it\u2014 fighting is a glorious business\u2014 fighting with swords, I mean. Then there\"s the uniform\u2014 the epaulettes, the bright buttons, the sash, the striped trowsers, thejspurs, thejehapeau, the waving plume, the stars of honour, the brilliant sword by your side, the gauntlets on your hands, the gaily caparisoned horse !\" \" Jim !\" cried Poll, withdrawing from his arms. \"Well, Poll?\" \" What do you intend to do with me ?\" \"Take you with me, of course. We'll be rich, admired, savoured, feted! I shall be a great commander ! you, a great commander's lady ! Ha ! what, do you think of that ?\" \" But Burloch ?\" \u201e, \u201e . . '* He is to be a great king\u2014 the king of all the Mexicans. When Mexico is conquered we shall invade and take the other states, one after another, till the whole South American continent is ruled by Mexico. We've got a large number of the greatest men in the country in the enterprise ; the expedition is to be a private one and made public ' when we Jhave landed and conquered Mexico."], [96, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 88 But the worst of it is, it's going to take a great deal of money. Each man is to put in so much. Burloch will put in the greatest part ; and when every thing is ready, which will be before long, we shall start for conquest and for glory.\" \" How much have you got to put in, Jim ?\" \" Not much, I believe ; Burloch's policy is to make the rich men pay it all ; and he has begun a crusade against the Langton property to get money enough to start the expedition with.\" \"Will he succeed?\" \" I guess he will. He's a shrewd nan ; and when he says he'll do a thing, he is just the man to keep his word. It's going on now.\" \" What ?\" \" The tug between Burloch and the Langtons ; and, though I don't exactly know how it's working, still I know it's making trouble, from the many long faces I s\"p every day ; you know the Langton property is the largest estate in New York, and as there has been so much of it cut up and sold and re-sold over and over again, you can imagine the number of persons interested in it. And when such a keen, shrewd man as Aaron Burloch walks in to disturb it, you can fancy the trouble and agitation it must create. But let us kiss and go to bed ; for I am tired and worried.\" Oh, rare Gentleman Jim ! He had that on his mind that worried him ; the secret was too vast too keep, and yearning for a confidant ; and so,t keep to himself the greater secret, he betrayed a lesser one ! Oh, rare, Gentleman Jim. CHAPTER XII. To return to the merchant. On the departure of the coffin-maker with the body, Alison Clark returned to his own room a prey to the most extraordinary emotions. To calm his nerves, and proceed with that for which he had blasted his soul for ever, he procured i\u00bb fresh bottle of wine, and drank glass after glass with nervous rapidity. Fearing, every moment, the return of his wife, he resolved to finish his work before she came home ; and for that purpose, entered the room of the trader, Going to the trunk, he opened and examined the main chamber, but found nothing to reward him for the dark deed with which he had stained his soul A secret drawer at last met his eye, and opening it, he beheld a few rouleaus of gold and a number of papers Pocketing the former, he seized the latter and ran his eyes over them with startling avidity. But why starts he now ? Why that clouded brow, that gaping mouth \u2014 that staring eye\u2014 that quivering of his muscles\u2014 that ghastly look\u2014 that hollow laugh\u2014 that shaking of his frame? \" My uncle ! great God ! I have murdered my uncle !\" And hollow laughter rang through the chamber. And here \u2014 here!\" he exclaimed, gazing with horror upon the open papers in his grasp, \" here is the damning evidence of my guilt !\" And he started up, and rushed back into his own chamber, \" And for what have I killed him ? A fe w pieces of gold ! Of all his vast pro perty I cannot toueh a penny ! His money in the bank I cannot draw without a checque ! My uncle, too !\u2014 IJad I but wailed\u2014 hejhaving no other relatives, it might all have been mine ! As it is, for a few pieces of ready gold, I have spent hundreds, and blackened my soul forever with\u2014 murder ! This vast estate, too five blocks of the most valuable property in the city\u2014 and I cannot touch a penny of it without being detected, arrested, and punished! But the money in bank\u2014 the seventy thousand dollars that this book speaks of\u2014 a checque. He paused, with a bitter smile."], [97, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 89 \" Yes,\" he added, grating his teeth, \" it shall be mine ! To murder I must add another crime \u2014 forgery ! Yes, I 1 do it \u2014 having entered the career of the crimi nal I'll wade through it to fortune or the scaffold !\" Thus ever in guilt's darkest chamber, doth crime lead on to crime still darker. The door bell now rung. \" 'Tis my wife,\" cried the merchant, starting. \" Now to murder, I must add \u2014a lie!\" Returning to the chamber, he restored the papers and bank-book to the secret drawer ; locking the trunk, he put the key inte his pocket, and then flung a glance around the room, to see if aught could reveal his guilt. Satisfied that everything was right, he returned to his room, and flung off his coat, vest, neckcloth and boots ; replacing the latter with a pair of slippers, he then descended and opened the door. But it was not his wife that stood before him. \"Let me in,\" said an agitated voice that the merchant immediately recog nised. N>.;12"], [98, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 90 \"The matter?\" demanded the merchant, trembling, and closing the door as his visitor entered. \" The man \u2014 \" stammered the coffin-maker, \" the old man \u2014 how did he die ?\" \" What of him ?\" said the merchant, in surprise. \"You mentioned something to-night of Signor Franzoni, the poisoner,\" said the coffin-maker, trembling from crown to heel. \" Either the Italian has played you a trick, or you have made a mistake !\" \" Wliat mean you?\" gasped the merchant. \" This,\" answered the coffin-maker, with a dark scowl. \" The old man was not dead when we coffined him \u2014 and when we carried him to the vault, he started from his prison, and is now at large ! If harm come of it, sir merchant, look to your life.\" With these words, Owen Orney opened the door, and darted home. The merchant gave a deep groan, and fell lengthwise on the floor. CHAPTER XIII. The next morning, with the rising of the sun, Adam Brown awoke from his slumber ; and as through the night his dreams had been restless and unhappy, his thoughts, on waking, reverted to the actions of the preceding evening. Aud painful, yea, agonising in the extreme, were his reflections. With all the little cunning of a generous heart, he had sought and received an invitation to take up his abode at the house of his nephew ; he had cherished, long before his arrival in the metro- polis, thoughts of the happy hours in store for him in the evening of his days, when he should take up his home in the dwelling of his long known, but as yet unseen relative ; and now. that very nephew, for the sake of filthy lucre, had drugged hi? drink, and played the part of an assassin. The veteran groaned at the thought ; and so abstrusely was he buried in reflec- tion on this point, that he, for the time, forgot the existence of the young and tender ones whom he bad so recently discovered and taken under his protection. But the old man's heart was one of those kindly ones that ever stream with the milk of human love, despite all the ill returns of those undeserving of his savour ; and thus, in the natural kindness of his heart, the grey-haired trader reasoned : \u2014 \" I'll not go and upbraid him\u2014 no, no, no : 'twould make him so unhappy. I'll go away to some retired spot, and keep there, deep, deep, deep in the shade, till he repents, and seeks me of his own accord. Then, then I'll forgive him, and we shall all again be happy. -He can't be entirely bad \u2014 no, no \u2014 not entirely bad ; for he is of the Mansfield blood, and the Mansfields, though sometimes wild in their youth, are good stock \u2014 very good stock\u2014 when they get old and settled. No, no, he cannot be entirely bad \u2014 of course not \u2014 of course not !\" i And the old man mused thus wise for an hour or more, his disturbed brain shooting out thought after thought, and all kindly ones, till one flashed forth more striking than all the rest, and it startled him. \" Bu why did he do it? For money ? No, no, no \u2014 he is rich \u2014 full of energy and talent, and rich in credit. Could he have been run? His ventures are large, his speculations numerous \u2014 perhaps, fortune jilted him in some important venture \u2014 he had a note \u2014 a heavy one \u2014 perhaps several notes \u2014 to meet, and money short, and loans hard to be obtained ! Yes, yes, yes \u2014 that's it, that's it \u2014 I know it is I But my death could have done nothing for him, when my money was in bank ! Perhaps he thought it was in my trunk, and so,\" and the tears trickled down the old man's cheeks, \" to thvv himself, the poor man thought he'd murder me I\" And Adam Brown groaned. \"But he must be saved!\" he continued, \" yes, yes, he must be saved! He must not be plunged into woe, ruin, or disaster, for want of a few dollars \u2014 no, no \u25a0"], [99, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 91 he is a Mansfield, that's enough \u2014 quite enough\u2014 quite ! Yes, yes, he must be saved !\" And so he rose, though with great difficulty, for the wound in his side was very painful, and put on his clothes. This done, he rang the bell-cord, which was im mediately answered by a servant. \" Pen, ink, and paper,\" said he, laconically. At this moment the proprietor of the hotel entered the room, and after con gratulating him on his narrow escepe, wished to know how it happened, and all about it. The old man was taken all aback, and hardly knew how or what to answer. If he told the truth he would have to injure his nephew ; to avoid that, he would be compelled to manufacture a falsehood. To avoid both he merely replied, \u2014 \" I do not wish to talk upon the subject, sir \u2014 it makes me remember my pain.\" \" Excuse me,\" said the other, colouring ; \" I did not wish to be intrusive. But your young friends \u2014 will you breakfast with them, or at the public table?\" \" My young friends !\" repeated Adam Brown in astonishment. \" Those you brought hither yesterday afternoon,\" continued the landlord. And for the first time the memory of his dear ones returned to the veteran, and he was filled with emotion. Desirous, however, of privacy, to indulge in reflection, he answered, \u2014 \" I wish to breakfast with them, by all means, sir. You will oblige me by having it ordered up as soon as possible. Do you know whether they have yet risen?\" \" They are, sir. Do you wish them to be informed that you are here?\"J \" It would be a great pleasure to me, sir.\" \" It shall be done.\" \" Thank you, sir.\" And the landlord quitted the room. \" How strange that I should have forgotten them!\" muttered Adam Brown ; \"and I found them but yesterday, too !\" And thus for long minutes he communed with himself; his brow at times clouding, anon lighting up. To his first resolve his mind adhered, but with this addition \u2014 the orphans should go with him. But man proposes \u2014 God disposes. The reunion of the uncle and his tender ones came ; it was a happy time ; and big tears \u2014 joyful ones\u2014 hung in the eye caverns of each, unseen by the other, the joyful drops could leap forth and ease the anguish of their joy. By twelve o'clock every arrangement had be n made \u2014 the proposed sum sent in a secret but certain manner, to Alison Clark ; aud, settling the bill, Adam Brown and his beloved ones, entered a carriage, and were driven to their new, temporary home. But again we must repeat\u2014 man proposes, God disposes. CHAPTER XIV. The same day, about ten o'clock, Gentleman Jim bent his way to the office of the attorney, John Griffin. \" What news ?\" said the latter. \" None, save that I am elected chief of the gang.\" \" You ?\" said the attorney, in amazement. \" The gang would have it so,\" said Gentleman Jim, with a careless laugh. \"And Hazard?\" \" You can trust him. When, according to order, I quitted my boarding-house and initiated myself into the gang, I found Hazard possessed of power most absolute. The Owlers found me talented, and I soon became one in authority"], [100, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 92 Before I knew it, I was announced as a candidate for the leadership of the gang. The election came, and the majority of the votes were in my favour. Since that time, Hazard has been my enemy.\" \"A natural consequence,\" said the attorney, dryly. \"Then you think lie can be trusted ?\" \" I am sure of it. A more hardened wretch does not exist.\" \" Enough. You must now quit the gang.\" \"But \" \"Well?\" \" There is a female in the gang, who loves me.\" \"You must give me implicit obedience, Rule Ruby,\" said the attorney, sternly. \" I am ready,\" said the young man, meekly. \" The female that loves you must be forgotten when you quit the gang.\" The young man bowed ; but his face was pale. \" There is a female, sir,\" continued the attorney, \" one Elizabeth Stusrt^ the daughter of a widow, and one of seven heirs to a vast property, that is new agita ting a few of my clients. The girl, as yet, knows nothing of her tiuti to this property ; to prevent my clients from suffering when she shall come to thyt know - ledge, you \" And the lawyer bent his keen, glittering eyes on the young man. \" Well ?'' said Rule Ruby, calmly. \" You must seduce and plunge her into shame and crime,\" added the lawyer. The young man bowed. \" It will be necessary sor you to appear in a genteel suit,\" continued the attorney, \"and pass yourself off as a student of medicine. I give you sii: weeks to accomplish the task.\" \" I shall want money to procure me clothes,\" said the young man. \"Here is an order on my tailor; this is on my hatter, and this on ray boot maker.\" \" Am I to be rich or poor ?\" \" The widow is in middling circumstances ; you must be\" neither rich or poor. Man to succeed with woman must accommodate himself to her rank ; to be above or below her is a disadvantage. You must be a student of medicine \u2014 an orphan \u2014 supported by an uncle who has no other relative, and talk of expectations. Do you understand?\" \"Plainly. But my place of board ?\" \" There is a family in Franklin-street, by the name of Cook. Here is the num ber. The family consists of three persons, viz. : \u2014 an old man, his wife, and a grandson. You will board with them.\" \" You have made the necessary arrangements?\" \"Yes.\" \" HaTe you told me all .'\" said Ride Ruby, preparing to depart. \" No ; keep your seat. The elder Cook is another one of the heirs of the estate of which I have spoken. He is subject to apopleptic fits, and cannot live long ; his wife is infirm, and cannot long survive him ; the grandson, George, is a young man full of youthful blood, impulsive, ardent, imaginative and deeply loved by his aged relatives. At their death he will inherit their all, and of course be in the way of my clients. You must make yourself his companion, lure him into shame, vice, crime.\" \" Well ?\" \" Accidentally, his people must find it out ; the old man, being apoplectic, will fin 1 the discovery a death-fit, and his wife \u2014 deeply loving him\u2014 will, from the two griefs, soon follow him.\" \"And then?\" said the vagabond. \" His guardians dead, the young man, free, will, with your kindly aid, plunge deeper into profligacy '.ban ever. You mu6t place him among those who will beggar him ; a quarrel must follow \u2014 if he be killed, all the better.\" \"Well?\""], [101, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 93 * \"These two dead, five of the seven will then remain to be disposed of after\" wards.\" \" You give me rather arduous work,\" said the vagabond, thoughtfully. \" But no matter, the reward is great, and I am easily satisfied. But you have forgotten one thing.\" K What do you mean ?\" returned the attorney. \"Money to play with,\" replied the vagabond. \"I cannot lay siege to and capture the honor of a young female without dazzling and blinding her senses.\" \"How much will you require ?'' \"At least one hundred dollars,\" was the answer.\" The avaricious attorney was aghast. \" You are jes'ing !\" \" Am I ?\" said the vagabond, calmly. The attorney felt his blood creep at the peculiar sound of his voice. \" You shall have the money.\" \" I shall want three hundred more to play with in my essay upon young Cook,\" said Rule Ruby. The attorney groaned. \" Think you 1 am made of money ?\"' \" I think of nothing,\" answered the vagabond. \" If I am to destroy two young people, I must have the means to do it with. If I am to undertake a difficult work, I will not attempt it with tied hands.\" \" Your demands are insolent,\" said the attorney, hastily. \" Say.unjust, unnecessary, or some such word, but not insolent,\" said the vaga- bond, coolly. \" What do you mean, sir V demanded the attorney, coldly. \" This,\" replied the vagabond, calmly, and without moving a muscle. \" You must take back the word insolent, or\u2014\u2014\" \" Well ?\" demanded the attorney, haughtily. \" I shall knock you from your chair, and with my fingers dig out your heart.\" This was so deliberately said, and with so meaning a look, that Griffin, cold-heart ed \u00a3and cold-blooded as he was, paled with fear. \" I take back the word,\" he gasped, rather than spoke, \" and beg your pardon \" \" It is granted,\" reiursed the vagabond, calmly. \" Shall I have the money ?\" \" You shall,\" groaned the attorney. \"One word more,\" said the vagabond, deliberately. \" From the difficulty on this trifling point, I foresee trouble in regard to my ultimate reward. To prevent any misconception on that point, I wish you now to distinctly understand this sen- tence : \u2014 I suspect the man who first engaged me to be an agent or creature of yours: from you come my orders \u2014 'tis you who map all my tasks ; and when my labours are done, if I find any delay in the payment of my reward, you and you only will I hold responsible. If when I say \u2014 ' Pay what thou owest me,' there be any shuffling, halting or quibbling, then sir, encase yourself in a suit of steel : for as I live, I'll revenge me by hacking your breast and ripping out your heart.\" \" You jest !\" said the attorney, with a forced laugh. \" Do 1 ?\" returned the vagabond, calmly. Again, as before, the tone in which these two words were pronounced, caused Griffin's heart to quake and his blood to creep. =i \" When shall I take up my residence at the house of the Cooks V said the vaga bond, calmly. \" The morning of to-morrow,\" replied the attorney, catching his breath. \" I will see them to-day and inform them to that effect.\" \" But the Stuarts ?\" \" Well ?\" \" How shall I get acquainted with them?\" \" You will be introduced to them at the proper time.'' \" You give me six weeks to do a double murder in,\" said the vagabond, deliber rately. \" Every moment of that time is precious, and my property. You must not interfere with it, or rob it. When shall the introduction be made ?\""], [102, "TUSIlD'/E^rj.fiH >' V 91 '\u2022This man should have been a lawyer !\" muttered Griffin, astonished at his pertinacity and decision. \" When you wish,\" he added aloud. \u00ab I be<4 to-morrow morning by taking board at the house of one of the vic tims,\" said the vagabond ; \" let my introduction take place to-morrow night. \" Impossible ! I shall not be prepared !\" answered Griffiu. . \" You must make yourself prepared !\" answered Rule Ruby, coolly. ,p J-^81* weeks are mine to the last moment. I must render you au MC\u00b0unt- 1UI then, if any action of yours is necessary, it must be as I direct ; and it shall be . \"It shall!\" answered the attorney wincing. \" Shall the introduction be made to-morrow night .'\" \" Yes.\" \"Enough. Now give me the money !\" \" What money ?\" said the lawyer, starting. \"The four hundred dollars of play money, '\"answered the vagabond. \" You cannot want it all at once !', \"But I do!\" \" You can have it as you want it ; but not all at once.\" \" I must have it at once, and now ! Do you suppose me a child to come to you every time I want a dollar ? Give me the money !\" \" There !\" groaned the attorney, counting it out to him. '* You are a strange man!\" . , , \" A matter of opinion only,\" said the vagbaond, coolly. \" Have you any further need of me ?\" \"None, to-day.\" \"Adieu, then ! When you see me again, you will know and remember me.\" \" What do you mean?\" gasped the attorney. \" Tbat is for you to ponder on. Adieu !\" The attorney looked after him in astonishment, mingled with fear. The vagabond had scarcely quitted the office when Alison Clark made his appear ance.; he was pale, haggard, nervous : and when he informed the attorney of his busij ness, the latter, though somewhat surprised at his conduct, did not evince any as tonishment. It is a fact in human nature that when, for any cause soever, we injure a man, we, from that moment, become his lasting enemy. His kindness, and attempts at conciliation fall fruitlessly upon us, the depravity of our hearts once aroused, we run on in one eternal stream of shame, guilt, and crime. Having revealed to the attorney the object of his visit, the merchant took his leave. For several minutes after the departure of his visitor, the brow of the attorney was compressed into a heavy frown \u2014 his small eyes glittered with malicious fire. \" Fool !\" he muttered, at last, through his closed teeth, \"he gives me a task \u2014 bids me do it \u2014 and yet \u2014 O ! curse him ! \u2014 tells me but the half of his secret that I may work in the dark ! No matter\u2014 I'll revenge me upon him in the bill!\" A knock at the door disturbed him. \" Come in,\" said he, calming his features. The door opened, and our old acquaintance, Dick Hazard, made his appear - ance. \" Ha ! Hazard, is it you,\" exclaimed the attorney, his face lighting with joy ; \" I was thinking of sending for you. Sit down. But what's the matter, man \u2014 you look out of spirits. Has any thing happened 1\" \"If you want any more services out of me,\" said the ruffian, whose frontispiece betrayed the punishment he had received from Gentleman Jim, \" you'll have to engage me alone. I ain't the leader of the Owlers any more.\" \"So I understand, Hazard,\" remarked the attorney, carelessly. \" Vou know it then * * said Hazard, in astonishment. \"Of course,\" said the attorney, drily. \"Can anything happen without my know ledge?\" The ruffian looked at his companion uneasily."], [103, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 95 \" You needn't be afraid, Hazard,\" said the attorney in a patronising voice, \" he shall not disturb you for the future.\" \" He? \" exclaimed the ruffian. \" Yes, Hazard \u2014 you know who I mean\u2014 your rival, gentleman Jim. But how did you come to let him punish your profile so? I always thought you good for a dozen men, at least ! \" \" It warn't a fair mill ! \" said the ruffian sulkily. \" Well, no matter,\" said the attorney carelessly. \" He shall not disturb you, again. I have provided for him.\" \" You ? \" cried the Owler, starting. \"Exactly. He's now in the cage.\" \" Nabbed ? \" \"Yes.\" \" When does the trial come off? \" \" It depends entirely as I direct,\" said the cunning attorney ; the state attorney is my^ friend. If I whisper him to hurry on the trial, he'll call it in a week. If I wish it postponed, the poor wretch will have to linger some ten or twelve months.\" \" I see \u2014 I see,\" said the Owler thoughtfully. \" For what have you nabbed him?\" \"A felony,\" answered the attorney, coolly. \" Will it go hard ag'in him 1 \" asked the ruffian. \" If I wish it,\" replied Griffin, significan fly. The countenance of the Owler now underwent a \"rapid change, which was not lost upon the lawyer. \"If so be that you have anything important to be done,\" said the ruffian in a thick voice \" anything, and you want it done cheap, just say the word, and I'm your man.\" \" I don't understand you, Hazard,\" said the lawyer, drawing his chair nearer to the Owler. \"Explain!\" And he bent his small, snake-like, glittering eyes on those of the Owler. \" What I mean is this,\" said the ruffian: \" I hate that fellow \u2014 that Gentleman Jim \u2014 with all my heart and soul ; and if you'll just keep him in the crib as long as you can, and so torment him with uncertainty in his 'prisonment, and then when his trial comes on, have him committed, so that he shan't come among the Owlers any more, I'll do whatever yer want, and not charge yer a single cent. That's it? \" \" I'll think of it, Hazard,\" said the attorney, slowly. \"A client of mine has a relative \u2014 an uncle \u2014 who is very rich. This uncle for some cause or another, has suddenly quitted the residence of my client, and taken up his abode in some ob- scure part of the city. He was seen to enter a carriage \u2014 108 1 think is the num- ber of it \u2014 with two young females and a blind boy.

If the old man has made no will, my client, being a relative, must by law, come in for his share of property, which, as the estate is large, must be of no inconsiderable amount. As my client is liberal, your reward will be large, and amply compen- sate you for your time and labour.\" \" Make this the condition,\" said the Owler impatiently, \"and I will hunt the old man and his children to the farthest parts of the earth. Keep that Jem in prison a long while \u2014 cut him off from his friends \u2014 torture him with the uncertainty of his fate \u2014 get him convicted at the trial, and I'll do anything you want for half price.'' The lawyer and the ruffian exchanged looks. \"Well,\" said Griffin, \"let that be understood. I promise all you ask. But time flies, and I have much to do ; go now, and begin your work.\" \"Yer don't want to see me agin, I 'spose till I can bring yer news consarnin' the old man and the little people 1\""], [104, "96 THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. \"No.\" At this reply, the Owler quitted the office : a fiendish smile playing on his dis torted countenance. \" We'll see who'll be cap'n now !\" he muttered. With the departure of his companion in crime, the attorney's small, snake-like eyes glittered with triumph. \" Thus,'' he exclaimed, \" thus on the passions of the merchant and the ruffian doth wisdom batten and draw wealth !\" CHAPTER XV. THE PAINTER. Months have elapsed \u2014 winter has come and gone \u2014 spring hath melted into summer \u2014 the golden sun, rich in its radiance and beams, smiles shiningly in the clear blue sky. All nature wears a happy bridal look, and yet there's not a face in all the vast] metropolis, but wears a nervous, mirthless cheek. The steps of those you meet are quick, hasty, nervous. The paves are thin, yea, nearly all deserted. The harmless sop, the heartless jilt, the silly coquette, swathe them selves in perfumes rich and costly, and keep their chambers. None are abroad, save those forced by business or want ; and they hurry, with eyes nervous and mistrustful, through street and lane and thoroughfare, as if fearful of meeting a foe at each step and corner. In this vast lapse of time nothing of importance to our story has occurred, save what the ready wit of the reader has doubtless, conceived. In his nature firm, persevering, tenacious, Rule Ruby had accomplished the ruin of Miss Stuart, the woe of her parents ; the ruin of the young man Cook, and the doom of the aged relatives of the youth ; this he had done : but as the reader, already acquainted with the tenacity of his character, has already fancied it, we shall not stain our sheet with the particulars of the crime. Enough that it was done. Let us now return to the results of guilt. It was early in the afternoon of a warm and sunny day in June. In'hisjattic studio, Eugene Lincolu, the struggling artist, reclined, in despairing mood, upon his scanty bed. His eyes were closed in thought, not bleep ; and the haggard ness of his cheek, the sunken flesh around his eyes, the nervous quivering of his thin, pale lips, told how bitter were his thoughts, how sadly he had been used by fortune, and how despairing was his heart. A knock at the door of his chamber disturbed his reverie, and he sprang hastily to his feet. \" Come in!\" The door opened, and Rule Ruby entered. \" You are a painter, I believe,\" said the vagabond, coolly, and glancing around at the frameless pictures that lined the walla. \"Yes, sir,\" answered the painter, with a bitter smile: sor he thought how deeply he had paid in health, and wealth, and happiness for his title to the name A child of art. '' You paint portraits as well as landscapes, I perceive,\" said Rule Ruby, glanc ing around. \" Any, and everything, sir,\" said the painter. \" You speak in a bitter tone,\" said the vagabond, looking at him in surprise. \" Y\u00abur luck in the game of life has been, thus far, against you ?\" \"Yes.\" \" Believe me, I am sorry for you. Do you ever paint dead persons The painter started. \" Oblige me with an answer,\" said the vagabond, coldly."], [105, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 97 \" Never, as yet,\" was Lincoln's reply.

Can you do it ?\" \" I can.\" \"Will you do it!\" \u00ab I will.\" \" To-morrow morning, fifteen minutes before four, I will knock at your door, and expect you to be ready to accompany me.\" \" I shall be ready. \" It will be necessary to take your ea*el, brushes, colours, and paint, together with a primed sheet of canvas,\" continued the vagabond. \" I understand, sir.' \" Then I have nothing more to say. Remember the hour.\" \" I shall not forget it,\" \" Enough. Good day.\" \" A word, sir,\" said the painter faintly. \u2022' Well ?\" said the vagabond, coldly. \" It is customary, when called on by a stranger, to demand a fee.\" \" On your past ?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" I have told you that I need your serviees \u2014 have I not?\" \" Well, sir.\" \" If I need your services, and make an appointment with you, it is iny interest to'keep it \u2014 is it not?\" \" Undoubtedly. But\u2014\" and Eugene Lincoln, though his face up to this mo ment had been pale and haggard, blushed and faltered. \" Speak \u2014 explain yourself freely,\" said the vagabond. \" I have nota tasted Lfood since yesterday morning,\" answered the painter, in a faltering voice. \" Young man,\" said the vagabond, coldly, \" you should know better thnn to follow a vocation that keeps you in daily want of bread. You have talents, and so far as I can judge, genius : these attributes are a curse when not backed with energy. You are in the summer time of life, and yet you whine ever your mis fortunes like one paralyzed with age and a long life's toil !\" \" You speak unfeelingly !\" cried the painter, with flashing eyes. '\u2022 Not at all,\" answered Rule Ruby, coldly. \" 1 hut give yoti but a few cold words \u2014 the stern truth of which I have learned in my pilgrimage, thus far; I re peat it, unless you arouse yourself, your talents will plunge you into a beggar's grave. You say you have not tasted food since yesterday morning. Here are many excellent pictures\u2014 why do you not sell them 1\" \" I have offered them for sale, but no one will buy,\" answered Euaene Lincoln sadly. \" Will they bring nothing V ' Nothing worth a thought.\" \" There is a showy, brilliant, well-executed landscape,\" said the vagabond doiW to a picture leaning against the wall, \" why do you not sell that?\""], [107, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 99 \" Who will buy it ?\" \" Thousands would be glad to do it, if it were offered them. What do you value it at ?\" \" Fifty dollars.\" \" What can you get for it ?\" \" Not a tenth of the amount.' \" Can you get that P\" \"Yes.\" \" Immediately?\" \" Immediately.\" \" And yet you complain of want of food ?\"| The painter drew himself np indignantly. \" Would you have me sell the fruit of three months' labour for a paltry five dol- lars V he demanded, passionately. \" Would yon not rather do that than starve?\" The painter blushed, turned away his head, and groaned. The vagabond looked on him pitilessly. \" Your hunger is struggling with your pride. Before to-morrow morning your hunger will have conquered your pride. Remember the hour!\" With these words Rule Ruby quitted the studio. \" The fool !\" he muttered, as he descended the stairs ; \" to permit his love of art to eat him up. Nine men in ten would have hearkened io his piteous tale, and given him an advance of money . That in relusing him I have acted right, a few minutes will unfold.\" He was now in the street. An alley was opposite. In this the vagabond hid himself, to watch the expected egress of the painter. Rule Ruby was right. In a lew minutes, the painter left his house with the landscape under his arm, and hurried up the street. In a few minutes, he returned without the picture, and having under his arm a small package tied up with grocers' paper. His step was quick, but his face joyous. The vagabond had taught him a lesson. At the appointed hour, the following morning, Rule Ruby knocked at the door of the painter's studio. Eugene Lincoln being up and dressed, and ready, the pair started immediately on their journey. And indeed they formed a curious sight, as they strode through the streets, the one bearing the easel, and the other the canvas, palet, and brushes necessary for the strange work about to be begun. Day had scarcely broken; and the morning mist almost enveloped them in its grey mantle. jj,JIt was to St. John's cemetery, in Hudson-street, they directed their steps. ! The red streaks of the morning sun were just visible on the bosom of the arching sky as they reached the cemetery, and sprang over the fence^ The grave yard presented a bare chilling sight. Scarce a hillock or a stone was to be seen, to mark the reposing spot of the dead. \"Where is the tomb?\" said the agitated painter. \"You told me 'twas in a vault ; and I ses> no mark of one here.\" \" Look there,\" said the vagabond coolly, and pointing to the right. The painter started and turned pale. \" Lead on,\" said he. \"The vault of the church was already open, as if the vagabond had been there some minutes previous, or had bribed the sexton Jo leave it in that condition to give ingiess to himself and companion. \"The body is in there,\" said the vagabond, descending the steps. The painter followed him without making any reply. The vault was dark, and lined with coffins three and^four feet deep, tho atrees- here was heavy, close, and noiseme."], [108, "100 THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. All was still. Eugene Lincoln almost fancied he could hear the worms fattening on the decaying carcasses, and his blood crept slimily through his veins. \" Where is the body,\" he asked tremulously. \" Somewhere among that pile,\" answered the vagabond, pointing to the oppo site side. \" I perceive that a number of fresh ones have been added here since the one of which I am in quest was brought. However, I can easily find it by the name upon the plate.\" \" You must have good eyes to read a plate in such darkness as this,\" observed the painter. The vagabond paid no attention to this remark, but proceeded to the other side of the vault, and commenced his search : gazing keenly on each plate, as, one by one, he lifted or moved the caffins aside to enable him to read the inscriptions. \u2022' I have it at last I\" he exclaimed, \" come here, and help me to take it down.\" The painter complied with his request, and the coffin was taken down from the pile, and after some little \u2022'\u25a0 \"iculty, removed near the entrance of the vault. \" The stench is sickenii^, remarked Eugene Lincoln, as they laid it down. \"Itis the corpse of a young woman,\" answered the vagabond, coolly ; \"and women seldom smell agreeably in their shrouds. They are perfectly odorous in life \u2014 in death, like all things else, they are revolting. What are you staring at 1\" \" Great God !\" exclaimed the painter, as his eyes fell on the plate, \" Do my eyes deceive me \" \" What mean you ?\" demanded Rule Ruby, in astonishment. \" Miss Stuart ! Did you know her J\" cried Eugene Lincoln, turning a fierce look on the vagabond. \" I did,\" answered the In' ter, calmly. \" What then ?\" \" Oh ! she is \u2014 dead,'' sobh.-d the painter, falling, like one heart-broken, over the coffin. \"Rise, sir, and explain yourself,\" said the vagabond, raising him up. \" What mean you sir by this? Explain!\" Eugene Lincoln looked at him sullenly, and in silence. \" I have twice demanded an explanation of your words,\" said the vagabond, with imperious calmness. The painter replied not ; but continued to look his interrogator in the eye. \"Did you hear me, sir ?\" demanded Rule Ruby. But there was no need of lliis question : for by the fixed, absent, dreamy lustre of the painter's eye, the vagabond saw that he was lost, buried, in chasing up old thoughts, memories, and scenes. \"Time flies, sir,\" said Rule Ruby, laying his hand upon Lincoln's arm, and shaking it. \" Time flies, sir, to your work !\" \" Unscrew the lid,\" said the painter abruptly. Tne vagabond drew a screw-driver from his pocket, and in a few moments, the upper part of the lid was raised and thrown back on its hinges. A horrible sight now presented itself: the face of the corpse was covered witn a piece of black cloth. '\u2022 Are you ready ?\" demanded the vagabond. \" Yes,\" answered Eugene Lincoln, in a voice husky with emotion. The easel stood on the left ot the entrance, with the primed frame resting on the cross piece ; palet and brush in hand, the painter\u2014 his hat off, his hair almost on an end with emotion, bis coat buttoned up to the chin\u2014 stood before the easel to commence his painful task. \" Are you ready?\" repeated the vagabond. \" 1 am,\" replied the artist. \"This is the face I would have you paint,\" cried the vagabond, suddenly raising the black cloth. ' As if met by a basilisk, the painter started, and gazed, horror-stricken, at the ghastly sight. ' In the long, lost, decaying repose of human clay, a young female, who curried trom the bustling, chequered, ever-changing arena of life, by"], [109, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 101 avarice of man : her days on earth marked out, appointed, shortened ; her heart played with, rent, crushed; her name destroyed, her hopes cut off, her honour rifled, her reputation bla sted for ever ! The voice that God created, hushed for ever by man !

And is this a fiction ? Do my readers fancy this a brain pictur e ? Pah ! In this mighty metropolis, where the thirst and hankering for gold and estate reveuues are so strong and conspicuous, there is more murder, \u2014 cool, calculating, deliberate murder\u2014 done, than is written in the police ledger. Crime \u2014 that species of crime which when bunglingly done gives the perpetrator to the scaffold \u2014 runs rampant throughout all classes of society ; no grade is without its unhung, untried criminals. If every muiderer in London were tried and hung, not one day in the year would pass without an xecution. Mothers daily poison, strangle, secretly bury or desert their' illegal offspring, seducers riot over the bones of their victims; husbands beat, bruise and mangle their wives \u2014 they die \u2014 the grave receives their carcasses \u2014 the husbands are imprisoned \u2014 time slides, and the wrath of relatives subside into forgiveness to avoid \" public opinion\" \u2014 the charges are withdrawn, and the assasrin-husbands are set free ! Nay, the very laws offer inducements to the assassin, if, for murder, he or she will give so many pieces of silver and gold. What marvel then cur cemeteries and vaults and grave-yards are crowded with the corpses of the young ? It was a ghastly sight which the removal of that black cloth revealed. A head \u2014 for naught else was visible \u2014 with the once dark hair now disparted and loose and glossless ; the bandage that ran from the chin to the crown, rent and eaten away by rats and vermin ; the ghastly flesh sunken and caverned where the vermin had feasted ; the skull bones protruding where the flesh had faded ; the eyes eaten out and their caverns alone proclaiming what once had filled them, and slimy worms creeping lazily from the nostrils and gaping mouth, and gorging and battening on their loathsome food ! The sight was terrible. The painter was pale, horror-stricken. The vagabond was cool. \"On with your work, sir,\" said Rule Ruby, sternly. \" This is no time for sen- timent or folly. On with your work, sir.\" Eugene Lincloln started at the command, and flung a glance of scorn upon the vagabond. \" That look shall be atoned for when your work is done,\" said Rule Ruby, calmly. \" As I am in haste, you will oblige me by beginning and finishing your task as soon as possible.\" So saying, he took a book from his pocket, and, seating himself on a coffin, began leisurely to read. \" Is it in this state that you wish the corpse painted ?\" demanded Eugene Lincoln, scarce knowing what to make of his strange employer. \" Yes,\" answered the vagabond, drily. The painter \u2014 nervous and trembling \u2014 began his irksome task. It was hard on to noon, when Eugene Lincoln interrupted his employer by ex- claiming, \u2014 \" There, man ! the picture is done. Behold !\" The vagabond rose calmly from his seat, and approached the easel to examine the picture. \" 'Tis well,\" said he, after a few nrnutes. \"I am satisfied. Now help me,\" he added, after re-screwing the lid, \" now help to return the body to its restiag place.'' Eugene Lincoln complied without making any reply ; and in a few moments they were prepared to quit the vault. *' My money,\" said the painter, stretching out his hand."], [110, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 102 \" In a moment,\" said the vagabond, plunging his hand into his breast, as if in search of a pocket-book, or purse. \" Ah, 'tis here !\" he added calmly, withdrawing his hand. . . Eugene Lincoln started back ; for the hand of the vagabond grasped\u2014 neither pocket-book no \" purse but \u2014 a pistol ! \" Young man, said Rule Ruby, coolly raising his weapon and pointing it in the direction of the artist's breast, \" your reward is \u2014 this !\" \" Gracious God !\" cried the startled painter, in a voice choked with surprise, dismay and fear, \" what mean you?\" \" This,\" replied the vagabond, deliberately; \"you know too much ; and it is necessary for my safety, that you die. Prepare!'' \" Mercy !\" shrieked the artist, staggering back, \" I \u2014 I know nothing. Let me pass, and I'll charge you nothing for the picture ! Let me pass \u2014 \" \"Silence!\" interrupted the vagabond, freezingly ; \"you had the temerity to read the name of the corpse on the plate. It is known at the police \u2014 it is known by the corner \u2014 the fact was mentioned in the papers, that Miss Stuart died the death of a Magdalen and suicide. It is no secret to the public ear that her daugh ter's infamy broke the heart of Mrs. Stuart, and plunged her into an Untimely grave ; that remorse for her own shame and her mother's woeful death prompted the fallen daughter to drain a phial of deathly poison, and snap asunder the feeble thread connecting her with life. Nay, suspicion is abroad too, that he who lured th girl to ruin was privy to her own and her mother's death. Nor is this all; an aged couple, heart-stricken by the vile courses of their grandchild, now slumber their long sleep ; the grandchild, lies in a hospital groaning with a terrible malady; and dark words have been hinted \u2014 whether ttue or false matter not \u2014 that the man who lured Miss Stuart from virtue to the shroud of the wanton and suicide, was somewhat instrumental in their deaths and their grandson's misery. If it were also hinted that he came here \u2014 to this still, lonely abode of the dead \u2014 to have the suicide's death semblance taken, suspicion would spring at once into certainty and the man be arrested. To prevent any such unpleasant consequence, you \u2014 who might have shown your wisdom by concealing your knowledge of the frail one's name \u2014 who have me in your power \u2014 you, I say, must die !\" \" You cannot mean it?\" gasped the; painter, whose eyes werernow about starting from their sockets with fear. \" On the threshold of eternity,\" said the vagabond, in a calm, freezing, merciless voice, \" it is customary with men and women, to spend their last thoughts and mo ments in prayer and communion with the Almighty. Out of compassion for your youth, I will give you five minutes to prepare yourself to encounter the sight and presence of the great Author and Master of your soul. Prepare !\" '\u2022 Oh ! spare me !\" cried Eugene Lincoln, falling in agony on his knees ; '! spare me, and I swear, by the living God ! never to betray you, nor divulge \u2014 \"j \" Foci !\" cried the vagabond, interrupting him, \"what care I for your oaths ! With me, they are but as empty, soundless vapor ! Trusting to false oaths, Eliza beth Stuart fell ; and mine were the lips that uttered them ! Think you, I am to be endangered and ensnared by the very weapons that I myself use against others ? Fool! you little know the stuff of which lam moulded. But time flies, sir; three minutes of the five I gave you have passed away forever \u2014 between you now and eternity hang two short minutes only. Make up the time that you have lost \u2014 prepare for death !\" The eyes of the kneeling, trembling painter now became glassy with despair ; the thin blood in his nervous, feeble frame coursed feverishly though his veins ; his mouth was agape; his breath became still and sort ; his hair rose almost on end with terror; his ears swelled watchfully, as if to catch the slightest sound. \" One minute\u2014 one minute only\u2014 is now left you,\" said the merciless vagabond in the same calm, cold voice as before. There was that in the desparing eye of the young and trembling artist to soften the stn est heart that ever\u2014 in hate or justice\u2014 sought the life\u00b0of one human ;"], [111, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 103 but the flinty soul of the villain Ruby knew no such thing as mercy. In the mighty crime of which he knew himself the instrument, he had but one though* \u2014 reward. Before that, he was content to sacrifice and immolate, if need be, all with whom he came in contact. In the vocabulary of his iron heart, there was no such word as mercy. \"Ten short seconds still remain,\" said the vagabond, composedly approaehing his victim. A low shriek\u2014 somewhat like a stifled groan \u2014 broke from the painter's lips, and then \u2014 from excess of fear \u2014 he totter\u00abd sideways anl fell \u2014 his eyes still open, but his mind lost to all consciousness. For a moment, & pitying gleam shone in the dark pupils of the vagabond's eyes : but, for a moment only : the next instant, he looked around. By the light of a small grated window, he beheld a heap of dust and dirt in a corner in the rear of the vault. \" The knife must do the rest,\" he muttered ; and returning the pistol to the pocket in his breast, he drew forth a short, heavy blftded knife. Stooping, he fas tened the fingers of his left hand on the neckoleth of ihe artist, and dragged the senseless body to the dust pile in the corner, and there flung it down. In all things cautious, Rule Ruby now disencumbered himself of his coat, and then rolled up his shirt sleeves in order to prevent the blood that was shortly to flow from staining or coming in contact With any particle of his clothes. This done, he looked around him for some implement wherewith to stifle the parting groans and hide the body. His eyes fell on a spade, standing among some other implements of burial, in the opposite corner. Seeming this, he returned to the prostrate artist, and stooping and planting his knee firmly on the breast of the body, he clapped his hand over his victim's mouth, while with cool, steady, passion less stroke, he drew the edge of the glittering blade across the senseless artist's throat. A low, gurgling noise\u2014like a broken sigh \u2014 followed, and the murderer was the sole representative of human life in that dark house of death. When satisfied that his work was complete \u2014 that his victim was indeed dead, the vagabond seized the spade and was proceeding deliberately^to cover the body, when a hew thought flashed aceross his brain. \"Aye, 'twill be better !\" he muttered; \" they'll never find him there!\" And he returned the spade to its place in the corner. This done, he clambered up among the coffins, and made his way to the ledge beside the wall. Here, after some minutes, he contrived to make room between the coffins and the wall, to suit his purpose; having accomplished which, he sprang down, and raising the body in his strong, sinewy grasp, placed it On the Second ledge. Then mounting to its side, it required but a few efforts to place it the Space he had prepared for it. Returning to the scene of the death,he heheld the blood that had oozed from the Wound fast sinking and disappearing in the earth. Strewing the moist spot with 0 accumulated dust, he soou had the saitsfaction of beholding all traces of the bl ody deed obliterated One thing bothered him : the painter's implements. How hide them ? His eyes wandered again towards the coffin-lined wall. \" Aye, twite a friend I\" he muttered. Seizing the easel, packet and brushes, he concealed them, like the body, between the wall and coffins. This done, he rolled down his sleeves, put on his coat, and drew on a pair of gloves, \"What now remains V he muttered looking around. \" Nothing save this death picture and myself!\" And for a few moments, he gazed thoughtfully on the picture.

'Tis past three o'clock,\" he added, drawing forth and examining the dial of a small silver watch : \" I must be going.\" Drawing a handkerchief from his coat pocket, he wrapped it around the picture, so as to entirely conceal it, and placing it under arm, cautiously ascended the steps so as not attract observation. Finding the coast apparently clear he strodeacross the churchyard, and, clearing the fence with a spring, found himself in Hudson- street. He was somewhat astonished at finding the gutters lined with chloride of lime ; and the streets nearly deserten. As he proceeded down the street, he, every here and there, beheld a carriage at some rich man's door, awaiting to convey the family to some steam boat, for a timely escape from the approaching pestilence. The shops, at almost every hand, were shut ; and of the private dwellings \u2014 the doors fastened, the blinds and shutters closed \u2014 and at almost every door, a small piece of paper gave the following notice : \"gone into the country.\" \"So soon?\" muttered the vagabond, contemptuously, as he read one of these notices. \" What need of fear or flight till the foe has come V \" Flee, brethren ! from the wrath which the Lord is about to visit on ye;\" now fell on his ears as he approached a corner. \"Yes, my brethren, flee from the wrath of the Lord, if ye don't wish to be swallowed up alive with the remorseless cholera!

As he turned the corner, he beheld no less a person than his old rival, Dick Hazard, mounted on a sugar hogshead, in front of a grocer's, haranguing a crowd of some fifty of both sexes but so duguised as to be scarcely recognizable. His whiskers were entirely shaved ; his neck was imprisoned in a white neckerchief, and his stout, muscular frame enveloped in a suit of black, like a travelling Methodist. \" Yes, my brethren,\" continued the speaker, '\u2022 if yer hold buck and do nt come up to the help of the gorspel, there'll be no more mercy for any of you than there is for the miserable wretches now dyiu' by the wholesale in the English Cannerdys.

The rush was equal to the appeal, and the \" treshury of the Lord\" soon display- ed signs of sinking under the offerings of its votaries. \" Fire! fire !\" was now yelled round the corner, and the next instant the^crowd scattered pell-mell in that direction, leaving the worthy gatherer oi gospel coin all alone ia his glory."], [113, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 105 Of the throng one alone remained\u2014 Rule Ruby\u2014 and his eyes were fixed on the astonished preacher with a derisive smile. \".

T1TK PLAGUE'S FIRST VICTIM. The room was plainly but neatly furnished ; the blinds were closed to expel the sun, and the apartment at.first looked dim. Sitting near a window, and engaged in sewing was a female in \"a loose white gown. Her hawk-nose and green, glitter in\" eyes,\"' though partly hidden by a pair of light spectacles, at once revealed to Rule Ruby his old acquaintance. \"Ha, Tib!\" he exclaimed, extending his hand, and re-assuming his former sprightly manner, \" how are you, old girl ? Tip us your feelers !\" \" Hush !\" cried Tib, coldly ;\"\\\" Mrs. Rose, if you please !\" \" I see, I see,\" said Ruby, laughing. \" Getting up in the world, and giving the cold shoulder to your old friends. \" 'Tis the way of the world.\" Tib rose, smiled coldly, and glanced at Hazard. '* It's all right,\" cried the latter. \" Gentleman Jim will have his joke, you know !\" \"No need of his being so free, any how !\" rejoined Tib, sharply, and sailing out of the room. \"Ha! ha! you musn't mind her, Jim,\" cried the Owler, with a significant grin. \" Bring the brandy, Tib.\" \" Not for me, Dick,\" said Rule Rnby, hastily. \" But, as I've not much time to spare, tell me what you mean by ' Griffin hasfdeceived you.'

Why arn't yer been among us?\" \" Circumstances kept me away,\" answered the vagabond. \" But what are you doing here?\" \" Mum I\" replied the Owler with a significant gesture. \" Oh, I'm not particular,\" cried. Ruby, coolly. \" But answer me one question.\" \"Go ahead.\" \" Griffin, you say, told you I was caged. Did he tell you why ?\" \" Yes ; for a fel'ny. And more'n that ; he told me he had nabbed you hisself, and that it depended on him whether you was kornvicted or not.\" The vagabond's brow was thoughtful for a moment. \"Now,\" resumed the Owler, \"as I've said so much, I want an answer in return.

Again Tib coughed, and, as it seemed to the vagabond, rather significantly. \" Have yer got the brandy, my dear?\" asked Hazard, shifting his chair closer to his companion. \"Do you want it now?\" said Tib. \" Now !\" replied Hazard, making a sudden spring upon his companion. At the same moment, Tib rushed into the room with a large quilt, for the purpose of smothering the hated rival. But Rule Ruby, who had been keenly watching the movements of his treacher ous companion, sprang aside, and the burly Owler fell over his chair. Rushing to wards Tib, the vagabond planted a quick, heavy blow on her chin, thatfelled her to the floor. Then drawing a pistol from his breast, he placed himself against the door, and pointing his weapon towards the Owler, calmly observed : \" You forget with whom you have to deal, Dick. I punislied you once before in a fair fight ; and I can do it again, week in and week out, without the slightest in convenience. Get up Tib,\" he added, applying his foot to the shoulder of the prostrate woman ; \" get up, and see what the matter is with Dick!\" The kick accompanying this order had the effect of rousing Tib from the floor, and of giving to her countenance the expression of a demon. The sight that met her eyes rivetted her to the spot. The Owler lay, half coiled, at the foot of the chairs, beside the window, and shak ing from crown to heel, like one suddenly smitten by the chills ; the blood had de serted his coarse cheeks, and left them with the clammy, cadaverous hue of death; the skin tightened on his bones ; his hair curled tightly ; his lips Were blue as indigo and their outlines tinged with black ; his fingers became pale and bony, but the tips and nails empurpled as if crowded with gore ; a horrible cramp in the bowels seemed drawing him into a ball. \" I've got it !\" shrieked the unfortunate wretch, writhing in agony. \"Brandy, \u2014 brandy \u2014 brandy, Tib !\"' \"Dick!\" cried Tib, in amazement. \" Brandy\u2014 brandy\u2014 brandy, Tib !

At mention of that frightful word, the Owler's paramour started as if stung by an adder. \" Save ! save me, Tib !\" howled the stricken wretch, writhing with agony . \" Mother of Christ I \"cried Tib, clasping her hands ni terror.\"' What shall I do!\" \" Call up help from down stairs and then send for a physician,\" suggested the vagabond, coolly. \" No one lives in the house but ourselves,\" returned the wretched woman. \" Then run for a physician yourself,\" returned Rule Ruby, in the same calm, quiet voice. \"Nay, let him die !\" cried Tib, preparing to hasten from the >oom.

Save yourself, Jim save yourself \u2014 fly!\" The vagabond returned his pistol to his pocket, and was turning on his heel when the voice of Tib arrested him. \"Jim !\" cried the woman, hastily, \" come back to the gang, and we will rule it together.\" \" I'll think of it,\" said the vagabond calmly. \" Meet me to-morrow night, Jim.\" \" Where ?\" asked the vagabond. \" At the den.\" \"I cannot.\" \" Why ?\" demanded the woman in surprise. \"No matter for the wherefore. Suffice it, I cannot meet you there.\" \" Will you meet me anywhere ?\" \" Yes. Name the spot.\" \" Say by the garden gate on the Battery,\" \u2022' Good. The hour ?\" \"Nine.\" \" And you'll come alone ?\" '\u2022 Alone, Jim.\" \" Enough, I'll be there.\" During this brief colloquy, the victim's screams were frightful. Rolling and bending, then twisting himself into every possible attitude, with agony, his looks and cries were terrible. As the dialogue above described drew to a close, the stricken wretch in the acuteness of torture had rolled himself towards the com paaion of his guilt and the sharer of his crimes. As Tib had uttered her last word of the colloquy, she felt the touch of the vic tim's hand upon her clothes. Turning quickly around, she beheld the miserable wretch looking up into her eyes with an expression of the most acute woe, anguish and pity. \"He reminds you of his torture, reproaches you for your neglect, and implores your pity !\" observed Rule Ruby. \"That for your insolence, hound !\" cried the hag, starting back, seizing a chair and, raising it on high, bringing it down, with the quickness of lightning upon the head of the doomed wretch. The miserable Owler fell back with a loud cry. With an exclamation of disgust, the vagabond quitted the room, darted down the stairs, and sped from the house as if pursued by a leper. The heartless paramour of the Owler hastened into the back room, ran to a small trunk concealed in the cupboard, hastily unloeked it, and plunging in her hand, drew forth a savings'-bank book, and a wallet, well filled with bank-notes, thrust them into her bosom, re-locked the trunk, which contained little else of any value, and then ran into a small bed-room, on the same floor, where hung a variety of frocks and other articles of dress. Throwing on a shawl and bonnet, she rushed down the stairs, quitted the house, and hastened back to her old quarters, the Owlers' den, where she was received with joy by the whole fraternity. 1 he hasty manner in which these two had left the house did not pass unnoticed ; and when coupled with the cries of the victim, which were now plainly heard by the neighbours and those in the street, created a suspicion that all was not right, and a crowd soon collected before the building. After various surmises and observations, and, as the screams and yells were now increasing in rapidity and loudness, it was at length proposed to enter the house. Accordingly, a number opened the door, passed through the narrow hall, up the stah case, and opened the door of the room from which the cries came forth. One among the throng no sooner laid eyes on the groaning wretch, than he at once recognised the symptoms as he had read them described in the news- ape rs."], [117, "THE ADVENTURES OP A VAGABOND. 109 \" 'Tis the cholera !\" Vie exclaimed. \" The cholera !\" repeated all, in terror, as with one voice. And down they flew, pell-mell, over one another's heads, and into the street as if flying from death. ' And as the word was communicated to tho se below, all started, as if pursuedlby a thunder bolt, and the miserable wretch was left\u2014 by all !\u2014 to yell and shriek and groan and die ! And now, the acuteness of his sufferings plunged the wretched Owler into mad ness. He stormed, cried, raved ! W ild words fell from his blue trembling lips. At this moment the door of the next house opened, and an old man, dressed in an old fashioned suit of brown, emerged into the street. His step was hurried and nervous, for his eye had seen the crowd as it gathered, had heard the frightful word that had scattered it, and now, when the young and the manly, the vigorous and sinewy, had fled and left the stricken one to die, that weak, frail, old man, in the nobleness of his heart, had resolved to visit the abode of the smitten one, and see what could be done for him. But his steps were nervous \u2014 for he thought of his loved ones. \" If he were to catch it, and die \u2014 his darling ones \u2014 who would watch over them ?\" And then science \u2014 with its still small voice, answered : \" He who watched over them when friendles and kinless, and gave them to thee!'' And old Adam Brown's heart was gladdened, consoled, and as he ascended the stone steps leading to danger perhaps death, the faith of the Christian nerved him, and his face grew calm, and his step firm as the tread of a soldier. He had already sent for a physician, and scarcely had he set foot on the staircase leading to the chamber of the stricken, when the physician stood beside him. But what frightful words are those that bid them hang back ? See ! the old man t embles \u2014 quivers \u2014 stands appalled ! The physician looks at him in astonishment, fear, amazement ! Hark to the howlings of the stricken one above ! Hark ! to the dreadful secret now revealed in his ravings ! Hark ! to that dreadful howl \u2014 that agonizing cry for mercy ! A heavy fall ! a parting cry .'.Jand all is silent ! And thus \u2014 all alone, and unattended ! \u2014 the man of crime gasped his last on th, and flew, a spotted, guilt-reeking spirit, up to the Trial Hall of Souls! CHAPTER III. THE SBCOND DAY. Like wildfire the word ran throughout the metropolis. Men trembled as they heard it ; women shrank as the appalling sentence fell on their affrighted ears, men cowered and gasped as they proclaimed it \u2014 \"The cholera is in the city !\" Like an electric shock upon the public nerve \u2014 like a thunderbolt from heaven ; \u2014 like the cry of \" Fire !'\u25a0 at midnight \u2014 like the cry of a mother wailing \u2014 like the boom of a cannon at dawn \u2014 like the falling of an avalanche \u2014 like the sudden and mighty rush of surging waters \u2014 like the crash and burst of thunder \u2014 like the blast of foeman's trumpet, that appalling cry fell on the startled people. Cheeks accustomed to the din and brunt and vicissitudes and calamities of life, blanched and shook and quivered : hearts, brave and tough and steeled as those of mail- clad warriors, quaked and cowered painfully ; nerves, no human foe could hav start' ed danced as if charged with quicksilver. From mouth to mouth, from ear to ear, the lazar sentence flew, till not a hear in all the vast metropolis but trembled at its knowledge of the danger speeding to its door ! From printeries and dispensaries bulletins were issued without number ; \" extras\" flew like falling snow-flakes ; men ran, yea, flew, to their darling homes as hee"], [118, "THE ADVENTURBS OP A VAGABOND. 110 heard or read the tidings, as if to be abroad were death, as if to be at \" hoe were exemption sacred from the plague ! Fathers trembled for themselves, their loved ones, and their offspring; matrons thought of their children, and, sighing fearfully, gazed long and trembling on their sons and daughters, and marvelled which of the darling ones would first be taken away; maidens thought and trembled for their lovers and their bridals ; the courte san shook and trembled as she pondered on her guilt, her chances of death, and the terrible Tribunal the pestilence might usher iier before ; old [sires and grand dames, their hoary locks and time-marked brows proclaiming the feeble bridge betwixt them and the grave, raised their palsied hands and eves to heaven, and implored the Eternal and his angels to guard and spare them ! And thus the hours of the terrible day flew into eternity in terror and dismay, and the trembling citizens of the great metropolis still cowered like timid infan s when looking on some object of affright. Noon came, and little groups of twos and threes and sixes met at the corners of the streets, and in low whispers asked teach other for the news. And when, as holding little slips of printed \"extras\" in their hands, they read tho ease of the man who died yesterday in Watts-street, they mournfully shook their solemn heads, and without uttering another word, or even shaking hands they slunk fear fully away. Noon passed : and the dials of the church clocks announced the hour of two. And strange men with hasty steps and nervous, and with neither coats nor jackets on, crept from low cellars and blind alleys, with mysterious post-bil!s under their arms and large paste-pails in their hands ; and when they came to walls and posts they pasted Up their bills, and then passed on to paste another on another post or wall : and on these white and yellow bills, in letters large and glaring, were these terror-adding words :\u2014 Keep cool ! Citizens ! Look to yourselves ! The pestilence is raging ! Up tojone o'clock, 7 cases \u2014 Deaths 5 ! \u00a3Keep clean \u2014 keep clean ! |Keep cool ! And as the people read these startling bills, their faces grew paler and longer than before. All, for a few moments, seemed robbed of life, energy, and action. Something enchained, entranced, paralysed them. The clock struck three. And ere the last stroke had ceased to echo, the people drew a long, deep breath , and then life and activity again were visible. And now followed a scene like that of the panic-stricken legions of the battle field. In carriages, hacks, waggons, and on horseback, might be seen hundreds, with hastily caught-up articles of dress, fleeing with frantic speed, to the various steam boat landings, to escape the affrighting scourge ; with this one thought risible in their fear-gleaming eyes and on their pallid cheeks : \u2014 The cholera is in the city ! Youths and men \u2014 with trunks, valises, and hastily done-up bundle3 \u2014 grown up women and young and tender girls \u2014 and all fleeing to leave the pestilence be hind them. Church bells rang as if a terrible conflagration were eating up the wealth of the proud and rich. Stores closed, as if it were a holiday or sabbath. Trade halted, as if time had ceased and given place to eternity. The windows, blinds and shutters of dwellings were shut, as if each contained a corpse, as if the light ofjheayen were a thing to shun under the laeaviest penalties as if no living hand remained to \" unbar the gates and let daylight in.\" And sill in streams, in crowds, coursed the human tide towards the steamboat"], [119, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 111 landings, as to the sole avenue of life's escape from the clutches of relentless death. It was a piteous sight, to see that mighty host overmastered and hurried away by such a nerveless fear ! Rending all ties, casting aside, as utterly unworthy, all hope and confidence in their Maker: and trusting to their own frail efforts to escape a too-speedy meeting of their indignant God ! Evening came, and the streets were lonely and deserted. The aii was sicken ing with the odour of the lime streaking and lining the gutters. The silver moon shone mockingly down on the doomed metropolis; the arching sky was cloudless and the bright stars gleamed, jewel-like, in the broad, cerulean dome. The winds sang joyously betwixt earth and sky; and were it not for the sickening limy tone in the air, it was an eve to invite all forth to banish care, indulge in hopes and serial dreams and woo eloquence up from the deep cells of the silent heart. At the appoisted hour, Rule Ruby stood at the gate of Castle Garden, on the Battery ; but, save a coarse-clad individual leaning against the railing and gazin\" silently down upon the slightly ruffled tide.no human being else was in sight. After waiting for a good half hour, for the arrival of Tib, the vagabond was about to quit the spot, when the stranger saluted him. \" I beg your pardon,\" said the latter, in a rough voice, \" but arn't you been expectin' some one?\" \" Yes,\" was the laconic answer. \" The first letter of the person's name don't begin with a T, does it now ?\" pur sued the stranger. \"And if it don't\u2014\" \" Then you arn't the person I'm sent to speak to, that's all,\" replied the man, coolly. '\u2022 But if it does\u2014\" said Rule Ruby. \" Then you will please to give the first letters o' your name,\" said the man. \" Suppose they were G. J.\" said the man. \" And suppose the person who sent me, had an I arterthe first letter of his or her name, vot 'ood the third be?\" continued the vagabond. \" B,\" answered Ruby. \" Enough,\" added the man, '\u2022 you're Gentleman Jim, and the cove I've got -a message for.\" \"What is it?\" \" This,\" answered the man, in a low voice. \"Tib and the gang are all cribbed, and that is vy she arn't here in person to pay you her respex.\" \" On what charge ?'' asked the vagabond. \" For bein implicated in some doins as is displeasin to the ossifers and judgiz,\" replied the man. \" Who are the prosecutors ?\" \" The state,\" said the man. \" And Tib bid me say to you in priwate conferdence that you had better cut, as sartin affairs has been found out, as is mighty displeasin' to the books in such cases made and perwided.\" \" Any thing else ?\" asked Rule Ruby, after a few moments pause. \" Nothin' else,\" replied the man, \" unless it be as how I might say somethin' as you vouldn't take amiss,\" he added, slowly. ' Name it and fear not,\" said Rule Ruby, kindly. \"I'd like the honor oftakin' a priwate drink with sich a ginerwine feller as Gen tleman Jim,\" said the man, with a kind of bashful respect. \"Why so ? ' \" I've heered you spoken of by the Owlers,\" replied the man, feelingly, \" as vun of them ere sorts o' fellers as in pleasin' to think on an , mighty hard to find.\" \" Come on, then,\" said Rule Ruby, good naturedly. \" And I 'spose,\" continued the man, as they proceeded across the Battery, towards Washington street,' '.you vouldn't take it offensive if I was to make a little kind o' free on a sartin' pint V"], [120, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 112 ' shall take nothing as an offence than is not meant as such,\" said Rule Ruby. \u2022' Oh, I don't\u2014 I don't mean it as sich\u2014 I don't\u2014 indeed !\" cried the man, feel- ingly. \" Speak out, then.\" - . \" It's jist this,\" said the man. \" If you're goin away to any place in tickl r and f r short of funds, I'd like to have the pleshur o' lendin' you till you can get out of difficulties.\" \u2022 \" Thank you,\" said Ruby, somewhat touched ; \" but before I go, I shall manage to raise enough to defray all expenses. Nevertheless, I thank you every bit as much as though circumstances had compelled me to accept of your offer.'' And he gave his hand to the man, who grasped it with honest rudeness. \" Here ve are at Burns's,\" said Rule Ruby, as they reached the door of a low vern in Washington street. \" What is your name ?\" \" Jack Harvey,\" returned the man, \"Your mother keeps a boarding house, don't she ?\" \u2022' Yes. D'ye know her ?\" asked the man in surprise. \" I boarded there once\u2014 that's all. But let us in, and take our drink.\" They entered the tavern and drank : Ruby taking lemonade, and his com panion brandy. \"On second thoughts, Harvey,\" said Rule Ruby, as they quitted the tavern, \"I'll become your debtor for that twenty dollars, and pay you when I'm able.\" \" Thank you,\" said the otl/er, '\u2022 you'll oblige me very much. Here 'tis !\" And drawing a purse from his pocket, he counted four half eagles, which he gave to his companion. \"Which gang do you lelong to, Harvey?\" said the vagabond, as he pocketed the money. \" Dutch Mike's,\" answered the other. \" I'll see you again if I can,\" said Ruby, stopping and shaking him by the hand. \u25a0' Till then, good bye!\" : \" Good bye \u2014 lake care o' yourself,\" replied the man, returning the pressure and moving on. Rule Ruby gazed after him with an eye of scorn. \"Yen fool deserts his mother and plays the part of a generous thief to strangers. This money must, to-morrow, to his mother. I now understand why Griffin deals in such pompous language with that miserable Mrs. Harvey \u2014 his knowledge of her son's career, and his pretended power to destroy him. O the folly and stupidity of the world.\" And he turned into Greenwich street, for the purpose of pursuing his way home. As he strode along, uneasy thoughts stole into his brain, and a dark foreboding crept like a thick, murky cloud over his disturbed soul. \"Nothing can have been discovered relative to my deeds !\" he muttered ; I have been too keen for that. What have I then to fear ? Tib has made a mistake. 'Tis some crime of Hazard's, for which, he being dead, they have taken Tib and the gang up as supposed accomplices. But will Tib, to save herself, blnw on the lawyer? There lies the peril ! to him and me: for if he be seized, then all my deeds have been for nought ! I must see Griffin to morrow.\" CHAPTER IV. Rule Ruby rose early next morning and, in pursuance of his resolution went t o the attorney's office ; but learned from the clerk that Grffia had4left the city the day before to take his family to his country residence. \" And where is that !\" asked the vagabond. \" In White Plains,\" answered the clerk.

I have a message to send to her, to-day.'' \" You will have to send it to heaven, then : for she is dead.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Yes. She was seized this morning about three o'clock : at five she was a corpse at eight she lay in the trench i\" \"What means you by the trench?\" \" The trench of Potters' Field.\" \" The plague makes quick work with its victims,\" said Rule Ruby, glancing at an old man across the street, who was almost bent double, as if seized with some sudden pain. \" There's another,\" said he, colly, drawing his companion's attention to the old man. \u2022' 'Tis the third case I have seen in the streets, to-day. Run for a physician while I go and assist him,\" he cried, quitting the spot, and darting across the street to the assistance of the victim, The vagabond hurried up to the Broadway, and entered an apothecary's opposite Old Trinity. \" Where can I find a physician V' he demanded, quickly. \" You had better inquire at the Hospital,\" replied the apothecary. \" The physi cians are all up there, experimenting on the cases brought in.\" \"Experimenting!\" repeated Rule Ruby, in surprise. \"Then they have no knowledge upon the subject of the plague ?\" \"None, sir,\" repeated the apothecary. \"The cholera, thus far, has baffled the entire College of Medicine !\" \" But it shall not baffle me!\" exclaimed Rule Ruby, hastily. \" Bottle me two ounces of laudanum.\" \" You do not intend\u2014'' gasped the apothecary, turning pale. \" I intend nothing but to save myself from the experimenting College of Medi cine I\" returned Rule Ruby sarcastically. \" But, sir, under such extraordinary circumstances I dare not sell you so large an amount of laudanum. It is enough to kill a dozen persons.\" \" Think you,\" returned the vagabond, with a sneer, \" that I am fool enough to take it while in health!1\" \" But if the cholera \u2014 \" \" If the cholera seize me,\" interrupted the vagabond, \" a few drops of this will render me insensible to its pangs.\" \" Well, I've told you of the danger,\" said the apothecary, preparing to do up the required article ; \" but if harm come of it, be it on your own head.\" \" So be it !\" _said the vagabond. In a few moments the laudanum was done up, and, taking it, Rule Ruby threw down the money, and departed. But scarcely had he set his foot outside the store, when he beheld a carriage passing it, slowly ; and through the door, supporting the stricken veteran he beheld Lewis Hudson. Advancing to the vehicle, he inquired \u2014 \"Whither now?\" \" To the old gentleman's house, No.\u2014 Watt's-street,\" replied the young man. \" His name ?\" \" Adam Brown Mansfield.\" \" Go on,\" said the vagabond, darting up the street, \" I will meet you at the door.\""], [123, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND, 115 And the carriage went on with its victim, and Rule Ruby, turning into Fulton street, entered a liquor store. \" Have you French brandy ?\" lie demanded hastily. \"Yes, sir.\" \" Pure, unadulterated ?\" The liquor-dealer answered in the affirmative. \" Then give me a botfle of the best.\" He was soon supplied\u2014 the price paid, and the vagabond hastily quitted the store and started off for Watts-street. On his way, he beheld numbers of palanquins, borne by stout and lusty negroes, turning from almost every corner, and all making their way to the hospital. \"Ay!\" he muttered, \" 'tis raging now. On this crowded city of sin and shame and crime, the angry hand of an outraged God hath fallen, and terribly will it smile!\" \" Help ! a physician ! a physician ! help ! help !\" shrieked a female from a hastily flung up window, as Ruby turned into Canal-street. At the same moment, loud cries and shrieks were heard from within. But no good Samaritan was there to give his kindly aid ; for as the window upward flew, and the woman's cry for help burst upon the air, the passer's-by gave a hurried start, and, fear-struck, flew away, No help \u2014 God help the victim ! \u2014 no help in that hour of torture, pestilence and wo ! No help ! Funeral trains came now pouring out froia the by-streets, and treading, silently tearfully, mournfully, the broad thoroughfare of Canal-street. Anon, palanquins, with stricken victims howling behind the curtains that hid them from the eyes of the passers-by, passed through the funeral ranks, appall ing the pale faced living that followed the shrouded dead. And the sun shone down merrily, brightly, bumingly. as though it thought its sheen fell on a city of happy ones, instead of a city of mourners. Still, on to Watts-street, pressed Rule Ruby, with all his might and main, the carriage far behind him, with its old and stricken prey. He reached the door at last, and, in answer to the servant who responded to the bell, told in a few words, but startling ones, the condition of the veteran now hastening to his home, of the preparations needful for his coming, and of the stern neccesity of alacrity and work In that|house, so well arranged, where everything was in its place, and its member placed [on a footing systematic and becoming, everything[necessary,for the stricken one was soon gathered and prepared ; so that by the time the carriage halted before the house, the servants stood, calm and collected, at the door to lift the old man from the conveyance, and bear him to his room. As Lewis Hudson passed through the hall, a deep, blushing bow on his part, and a grateful curtsey, and deep, cheek-mantling glow on Marian Mansfield's part, told that they had met before ; that they were glad to meet again, and that the cause of their present meeting, though in itself terrible and sad, might should its dangers pass away, lead to a meeting and re-union they both had yearned for from their last meeting to the present. Up into his own room they bore, and on his cool and prepared bed they laid the suffering victim. And deep sobs, from kinsfolk and from servants, were heard throughout he house. \" Take off his clothes and swathe him in these flannels,\" said Ruby to the ser vants, pointing to the articles he had mentioned, The servant looked at him in surprise, but failed not to obey ; in a few minutes the veteran was bound in flannel that covered him at almost every pore. \"Now, hold his head up, and firmly grasp his arms, while I pour this mixture down his throat\" And as they obeyed, the vagabond seized a pitcher, standing on a small table, a hort distance from the bed, and, approaching the stricken, groaning victim, pouree"], [124, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 116 a purple liquid down his throat, and continued so to pour till the wretched man seemed strangling with the quantity he had imbibed. \"Now lay him down,\" said Ruby, putting by the pitcher. The attendants obeyed, and, at a second bidding, stole, noiselessly from the room. \" What have you given him ?\" asked Lewis Hudson, as the groans of the stricken one decreased. \"I'll answer that, when I have seen all danger pass away,\" replied Rule Ruby And the two young men fixed their eyes on the hoary one on the bed. And minutes passed, and the groans of the stricken one declined \u2014 anon, ceased altogether. \" Good!\" said the vagabond, at this stage. \" Why good?\" demanded Lewis Hudson, turning anxiously to his friend. \" He may, even now be dying?\" The vagabond replied not, made no movement, but kept his eyes fixed stead fastly on the old man on the bed. Minutes passed again, and gradually the flannel swathing the body of the vete ran began to darken. / \" Good !'' again burst from the calm lips of the vagabond. \" What mean you ?\" said Lewis Hudson, uneasily ; for he began to fear that the victim had burst a vein, and that it was blood that was now darkening the flannel. \" Hark !\" said Ruby, in a whisper, for at that moment,' from the lips of the sleeper there came forth a deep and heavy sigh. And at that same moment, thick beads of sweat came rushing from every pore upon the sleeper's cheeks and brow. \"Good!\" repeated the vagabond, calmly. \" You will not permit me to share the cause or knowledge of your joy,\" said his companion, reproachfully. Still Ruby was silent, and still steadfastly were his eyes fixed on the sleeper. Calmly now the old man breathed, like a little child reposing aster play. \" The danger and the crisis have entirely passed,\" said Rule Ruby, rising ; '* but he'll not wake till to-morrow.\" * \"No?\" said Lewis Hudson, inquiringly. \"Wherefore?\" \" Because the drink I gave him was too strong.\" \" \"The drink!\" repeated his companion, approaching the pitcher. \"Of what is it composed ?\" \" Smell it.\" \"There's brandy in it I\" n \"There is.\" \" And\u2014\" \"Well?\" \" I cannot recognise the rest.\" \"I'll tell you when I see the old man on his legs.\" Lewis Hudson was disappointed, and so expressed himself. \" Psha !\" cried the vagabond, laughing. \" Run down to thy beloved, and \"lad den her heart with the cheering words\u2014' All danger has passed away : my efforts have been successful\u2014 to-morrow, yon will embrace your uncle.\" Tell her this and while you gladden, you will, at the same moment, accomplish the conquest of Lewis Hudson looked at him in astonishment. \"d'nlfth thC me,\u00b0i!ini nf y\u00b0\"r,eyf.\" \"\"tinned the vagabond, with a slight smile, down there, in the hall, and both your secrets I read at once.

Besides,\" continued Rule Ruby, in a lower voice, \" you are poor \u2014 this maid is rich, and loves you, and it may be, but slightly now; but if to the love she has for you now, there be added the knowledge that 'tis to you the uncle that she venerates, owes the tenure of his life \u2014 his escape from the stern, deathly grasp of the cholera \u2014 be sure her gratitude and love, and the love and gratitude of her old uncle, will be to you all love can give to love, all a rich man's gratitude can give to his benefactor.\" Tears were in Lewis Hudson's eyes, and blushes on his cheek. \" And you \u2014 \" he muttered. \"I stand in no need of help,\" replied the vagabond, in the same low, calm, passionless voice. \" Besides, the credit of this old man's cure must fall on one of us ; me it cannot benefit, you it can make happy and enrich. Why, then, let it full on him whom most it will do good.\" \" O, give me your hand \u2014 nay, your heart !\" cried the clerk, impetuously through his tears. \"Back!\" said the vagabond, repelling him, calmly, \" you know not the hand you would grasp, you know not the heart you would embrace ! And I \u2014 I dare not tell you I My destiny is not a common one \u2014 my fate is not like yours. You cannot appreciate me, any more than men can rend the chain that binds their destinies. Go, and comfort this old man's niece ; say to her, 'All will be wel to-morrow.' Console her with that. Farewell.\" \" At least, at parting, give me your hand ?*' \"Lewis Hudson !\" exclaimed the vagabond, in a low, clear, thrilling voice \" the touch of this right hand hath ever been, like the mildew on the grain, a blight and a curse !\" With these words, the vagabond bowed coldly to the clerk, and took his leave. Rule Ruby's advice was sound, and Lewis Hudson lost no time in following it ; and when he conveyed the cheering intelligence to Marian Mansfield, he was re warded with an interview that filled him with hopes and dreams. It was hard on to noon of the following day, when Adam Brown, for such we must still call him, awoke from his deep sleep, His loved ones were around him \u2014 the blind] boy sitting close beside the bed, and listening to his breathings ; the witless girl a|short distance from her brother, and gazing abstractedly upon him ; and Marian on a chair beside the bed, her right hand resting on the coverlet, her head bent forward, and her eyes fixed anxiously upon him. A ray of joy illu mined the countenance of all as the old man opened his eyes, and, half raising himself, looked round. \" Uncle !\" burst, as with one voice, from the three, to greet him back to life. And sobs, and tears of joy, for his escape from the terrible plague, ktold th* noble-hearted veteran bow deeply he was loved. In an after hour of the day, Adam Brown learnt the particulars of his escape, and, if from that moment, Lewis Hudson was treasured in the old man's heait, is it a marvel that he was prized, lovingly, dearly, in the heart of Marian !"], [126, "THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. 118 CHAPTER V. At the designated hour, the vagabond called again at the office of ;the attorney but Griffin had not yet returned. \" Have you not heard from him ?\" he demanded of the clerk. \" Yes sir,\" replied the latter. \" I received a letter from him this morning ; from which' I learn that he will be in town either to-morrow, or next day. If your business is urgent, and can be attended to by me, I will do it with pleasure,\" added the clerk, who was quite taken with the magnificent features and figure of the vagabond. \" No, I will call to-morrow,\" replied Rule Ruby, with a quiet smile. And he quitted the office, more convinced than ever that the attorney meditated some treachery. And a bitter smile was on his lip, for well he knew his own heart\u2014 the resolu tion it had taken, and the dark fate to which it had doomed (the lawyer, if he should play the traitor. The next day, he called again at the office, but, according to the clerk, Griffin had indefinitely postponed his return to town. \" Here is a note, however,\" said the clerk, whose manner was somewhat con fused, \" which he enclosed in his letter, and bade me give to yon.\" The vagabond took the note, broke the seal, and without suffering his features to betray his feelings, silently perused the contents : \u2014 \u2022' Ruby, stop\u2014 the work must no longer go on. Some one has betrayed the scheme to the poliee, and the officers of justice are now in search of yon. Fly ! fly, instantly. Enclosed is a bank note of fifty dollars. \u2014 Take it, and fly !

Scarcely had he departed, when Grffin emerged from behind the screen. \u2022' Does he suspect 1\" he demanded ot the clerk. \" I think not, sir,\" replied the clerk. \" I thought the letter would work him,\" muttered the lawyer, seating himself at his desk, drawing forth his diary, and opening it ; \"I thought it would !\" \u2022 And he read the following \u2014 \u2022'Burlock, seized with the prevailing pestilence, and dead, there is no more need of destroying the obstacles which he discovered.

A sign met his eyes \u2014 that of Alison Clark's establishment\u2014 and he paused a moment. \" But I must have money, ere I fly,\" he muttered. ' I know a secret of yon merchant's \u2014 if I were to play upon his fears, now \u2014 I'll try Ut And he crossed the street and entered the store. Standing by the desk he beheld the merchant. \"I wish a few words with you, Mr. Clark,\" said Rule Ruby, approaching him \" Well, sir ?\" \" A few months ago,\" began the vagabond, \u2022' certain circumstances placed me behind an uncurtained window, through which I beheld an old man stretched. from the effects of a few grains of white powder mingled with his drink \u2014 ?\u25a0' !' Excuse me !\" interrupted the merchant, starting up, and turning to a clerk who w\u00bbs doing up a small bale of goods, a few paces from the desk. ' ' E ward take that package nearer to the door, and re-examine it carefully.\" \" Yes, sir,\" said the clerk, respectfully, obeying the order. The merchant resumed his seat, and bade his visitor go on. Ruby obeyed, and told how he had seen the merchant enter the house of the poisoner ; how, the following night, he beheld him ransack the trunk of his vic tim ; of his visit to the undertaker ; the coffining of the body ; the re-opening of the coffin ; the rising and flight of the victim ; the subsequent conspiracy between the merchant and his attorney to murder the old man's new-found relatives ; the death of the principal instrument in that conspiracy by the pestilence, and the arrest of the instrument's partner. \" Well, sir?\" demanded the agitated merchant, in a hollow voice, \"your object in paying me this visit !\" \" Money,\" replied the vagabond, bluntly \" Money \u2014 \" \" Aye, sir merchant\u2014 money for my silence !\" repeated the vagabond calmly. \" Your price ?\" demanded the merchant, whose cheek was ashy. \" Five thousand dollars.\" said Rule Ruby. \" And what guarantee shall I have for your silence ?\" demanded the merchant huskily. \" My immediate departure \u2014 \" \" From the city ?\" \" From the city and country.\" \"And forever t\" \"For ever.\" \" You shall have it,\" said the fear-strieken merchant, hastily. \" Call her on Saturday, at two o'clock.\" \" I must have the money to-day, sir merchant,\" said the vagabond pertinaciously. \" Do you mark me, sir? To-day !\" \" Impossible !\"' groaned^he merchant looking fearfully around. \" I have a note to pay to-day ; a note often thousand dollars, and as yet I have not the half of it made up. My clerks are out every where to raise me the money ; and if it be net all obtained before three o'clock, I am a ruined man !\" \" That is your affair,\" returned the vagabond, coolly. \" I must have the money to-day \u2014 now?\" \u2022'Spare me till Saturday, and I will add a hundred dollars to the amount you have demanded !\" said the merchant in a tremulous whisper. \"To-day \u2014 now!\" repeated the vagabond, mercilessly. \" Choose I etween oblig ing'me, and the walls of a prison \u2014 the c\\;u <A uMufiold !\" \" I \u2014 you \u2014ha !\" gasped the merchant, starting with a loud cry, as his eyes fell on an old man who had just entered the store.

But in vain : for Remorse and Shame lashed the merchant onward ; house, square, street after street he passed heedless of the many eyes staring at him in his flight and at the pursuing steps of the old greyhaired man behind him. On \u2014 on he dashed \u2014 pale, ghastly, fearfully his quick breathings rushing through his swelling nostrils like a high mettled steed on the plain, and the white saliva frothing around his mouth at each step and spring. On \u2014 on he darted, dashing aside or upsetting every one before him in his path \u2014 till he came to Franklin street. And there he rounded the corner, and sped down the street, towards his own home, as if pursued by the plagne. Reaching his residence, he sprang upon the brown stone steps, and, hastily opening the door, darted into the hall, up the staircase, into the room, and s en panting worn-out, exhausted \u2014 fell, with awild hysteric laugh, nevertheless, ense less, on his bed. And still after him followed the [anxious veteran ; his voice indeed hushed, but his sturdy limbs no wise slacking in their speed : and so bravely did they bear him onward in the chase, that he stood beside the prostrate body of his speechless nephew almost as soon as the servants, who were now grouped around the merchant in amaze. \"Fate works against me!\" muttered the vagabond, on witnessing the sudden scene we have just narrated. \" I am baffled here \u2014 I see it plainly\u2014 for the old man's pardon will surely fall on his miserable nephew.

As he flung his eye up the street, he beheld a figure that his eye could not fail to recognize run- ning hastily into a bank. \" 'Tis he !\" cried the vagabond, hastening his steps. \" I shall not lose him now!

How much farther ?\" demanded the attorney, uneasily. \"A few steps,\" said the vagabond, coolly, and turning into a narrow alley lead ing to a three-story building in the rear. When they had reached the building, they entered a narrow door, leading by a flight of wooden stairs, to the four stories composing the buildi ng. Up this rough stair flight, the vagabond led his companion, till they reached tho upper story ; on the landings which four doors, leading to as many rooms, were visible. Taking a key from his pocket the vagabond inserted it in thel ock of the rear door, and they entered a small room, scarce six feet in width, and hardly twelve in length.

Then taking down a blanket which hung against the wall beside the bed, he directed the eyes of his companion in that direction, by exclaiming \u2014 \" Look there !'' The lawyer turned, and beheld six frameless portraits. '' Who are these ?\" he gasped. \" Your victims '\u25a0\" replied the vagabond, calmly. \" Shall I tell you their names?\" \" 'Tis needless,\" returned the fear-stricken attorney; \" I know them all, save one \" Tis the likeness of a young painter whom I was compelled to kill, because he, like you, recognised the features of Miss Stewart. -But for that he might have lived.

When he arrived at the attorney's, he learned from the clerk that Griffin had already started for White Plains. Hastening to a livery stable, he procured a horse, and started off in pursuit of the attorney. When he had left the city behind him, and stood on the broad avenue leading to Harlem, he whipped his horse into a speed that nothing but desperation could match.

One glance was enough : and the chaise sprang forward with a bound that convinced the pur suer that he was on the right tract. And now the race began \u2014 that race 'twixt life and death. Onward flew the horse \u2014 behind, yet gaining at every step, the relentless vagabond. It was a long, long road that stretched before them, and .the white horse was already within a few yards of the chaise. And still onward flew the champing steeds in that fearful race. On the left, as on they sped, rose a thick leafy wood, its lofty trunks rising to the clouds, and its countless arms stretching on every hand. At this wood one glance was taken by the trembling wretch in the ehaise, another at the long road stretching afar before him. Behind, and gaining hard upon him, he heard the snorting and tramping of the steed. One look at the wood \u2014 bnt one \u2014 and the chaise branched off from the road toward the friendly wood. And still on its track, as follows the huntsman the game, bore the white steed and its rider. No cry for help \u2014 no command to halt. But onward, onward \u2014 as if the hunted one trusted to silence and exertion for escape ,as if the hunter had but one word to utter, and was saving that for the mo ment when he should have his foe face to face before him. To the wood\u2014 to the wood \u2014 deep, deep into its bosom flew the chaise and the white snorting steed. Afar, through the trees, the white Walls of a princely mansion rose, wooing the attorney to hope. The eye of the lawyer was strained on that friendly pile, as his only salvation, and down on the back and flanks of bis brown horse fell the sweeping lash to spur his footsteps on. Hark ! how the white steed comes driving down upon the chaise \u2014 hark how his firm hoofs rouse*, the forest echoes. As if conscious of the terrible spirit in its midst, the wood rustles fearfully ; the birds that were singing so blithely ere his entrance, have hushed their music; the black crows that had been stealing in the fields around have rushed with wild cries to this lone wood, for instinct tells them carrion is preparing ; from muddy pool and slimy marsh a thousand toads croak their hideous notes ; the squirrel leaps fearfully to the loftier limb ; the owl from its hollow nest, sends forth its dismal cry. A quick, sharp crash rang through the wood, followed by a despairing wail. In"], [132, "124 THE ADVENTURES OF A VAGABOND. its flight the chaise had run against a stump of a tree, shattering} the vehicle \u00b0 pieces, and flinging its rider against the trunk of a huge hemlock. In another moment the vagabond was near. \"At last,'' he cried, and leapt from his steed. \" At last,\" echoed the rustling wood. \" At last,\" howled the attorney, with a despairing groan. \" At last,\" repeated the vagabond, as he wound his hand around the neckcloth of his victim. \" You know the penalty of treachery ; for I warned you of it. But now 'twixt you and death, what bar ?\" \" And from his breast he drew forth a short, sharp, two-edged blade. \" I said your heart, knave! Dearer than that you counted your gold. To swindle me, you pawned your life: now for justice.\" And with his knife he ripped open the vest of the attorney. \"Mercy !\" gasped the wretch, whose cheeks and lips were cadaverous through excess of fear. \" Mercy ! take all I have, but kill me not. I am unfit to die!\" \" Think of your victims \u2014 you spared them not !\" \" I have gold!\" cried the wretch, whose fears had reduced his voice to a whisper. \u2014 \" Take all \u2014 but let me live \u2014 I am afraid to die I\" \"You must!\" answered the vagabond, coolly. \"I was poor, frendless, kinless, houseless.\" In this wretched world, that man is a working corpse whose hand is yet in that state I was when first you gave me your woik of death. I did it \u2014 stifling reason, honor, sense, humanity ; for I toiled for that which in this lazar world draws man from a living grave to the enjoyments of earth. All this you know, yet sought to defraud me of my wages. As I never showed mercy to your victims, so will I show none to you. You knew your traitor fate, vet wooed it to your avarice. Therefore, die! \" And around the breast of the throttled attorney, with his knife, the vagabond drew a circle which was marked with blood. A low cry \u2014 an agonising one \u2014burst from the lawyer's lips. r, ,\u201e Deep in the circle of flesh again went the knife. The eyes of the victim were fixed, stone-like, on his murderer. \" From out thy breast I said I'd pluck thy heart,\" observed the vagabond, calmly. \" And thus I keep my word !\" And, like a vulture fastening on the offal of a corpse the fingers of thejagabond drove into the flesh of his victim. \" Behold !\" A faint sigh sped from the lips of the attorney at that moment. t utijiui And high above the corpse the vagabond held a reeking heart. CHAPTER LAST. The clouds of night fell like a curtain ere the vagabond quitted thewco Meanwhile his horse had found himself food on the sward around, and drink from a pool hard by. In the pockets of the attorney, Ruby discovered a roll of bills, amounting to about five thousand dollars. Hiding this in his neckcloth, he waited for night to cover him, that he might return to the city. And as we have said, when night fell over the earth, the vagabond mounted his horse, and rede back to the metropolis. Well he knew what awaited him, if found when the body of his victim vas discovered, and his mind was made up in relation to the course he should follow. On reaching the city, he returned the horse, and then posted on foot to his lodgings. Securing his valise, he locked the door of his room, put the key into his pocket, and made for the lower part of the city. \" Once more a vagabond on the face of the earth !* he muttered, as he bent his steps toward the Battery."], [133, "The adventures of a vagabond. 125 A sailor-looking man was leaning over the railing, near the entrance of the Castle Garden, his eyes upon the river. As Rule Ruby approached, he turned and said\u2014 \" Have a boat, sir ?\" \" You let out boats?\" demanded the vagabond. \" Yes, sir. \" I want a boat to take me home ; for I have missed the steamer and the stage.\" \" Where is your home, sir ?\" asked the boatman. \"Down by New Brunswick. Does your boat carry sails?\" \" Aye, sir ; and a swifter, tidier little craft arn't to be found in port.\" \"Where is she ?\" \" There,\" said the boatman, pointing to a neat little boat moored to the landing staif s. \" Will you go and look at her V \" Yes.\" And the} proceeded along the bridge of the Castle Garden till they came to the landing stairs. The boatman entered his pet craft, ran up the fore' and stern sails, drew the painter, invited Ruby to enter, seated himself at the helm, and, there being a light breeze, soon satisfied the vagabond that the boat was worthy of her owner's praises. \"I'll take her,'' said Rule Ruby, jumping from the boat. \" Very good, sir,\" returned the boatman, fastening the painter. \" Come up to Burns', and we'll settle the terms.\" \" Nay,\" said Ruby, laugliing, \" we'll make the terms as we go, and settle when we get there. I may want to keep the boat, what then i\" \" In that case, sir,\" laughed the boatman, \" I shall want her price before you take her.\" \"At what do you value her ?\" \" One hundred dollars.\" \" I'll give you that for her,\" said Ruby. \" And throw a pint of grog into the bargain *\" demanded the boatman, laughing. \"Yes.\" \" Agreed.\" And they entered the public house where Ruby had formerly drank with Jack Harvey. The bill of sale was made out\u2014 the money paid \u2014 a glass exchanged between them, and then both returned to the boat. The friendly boatman shook hands with Ruby, slung off the painter, and gave the boat a push, and then darted up the landing stairs, to his former resting-place on the Battery, to take a last look of his pet craft, as she rode down the bay. \"Jesse!\" he cried, rolling a big quid sreui one cheek to the other, \"how bravely she bears down I\" k* And thus \u2014 with the broad, blue, star-crowned sky above him \u2014 the plague stricken city behind him \u2014 -the vagabond glided away for ever from the scene of his crimes, and bent his small frail bark out te the shoreless main, CONCLUSION i A tew words more, and we have done.
