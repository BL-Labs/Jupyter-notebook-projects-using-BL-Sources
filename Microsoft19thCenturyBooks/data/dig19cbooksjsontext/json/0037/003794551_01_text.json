The Algankinese are the most influential and commanding people in the whole of North America. Their name in Irish indicates as much, viz. algan-kine, or kine-algan, a noble community, corresponding to the Ph\u0153nician words al-gand-gens, which means the same thing. The language of this people is the master language of the whole country, and what is truly re markable, understood as Baron de 1 him bold t asserts, by all the Indian nations except two. What then are we to infer from this obvious affinity ? Why, undoubtedly, that a colony of that same peoplewho first inhabited Ireland, and assigned to its several lo calities those characteristic names, which so disconcerted the har mony of Mr. O'Flaherty's acoustic organs, had fixed themselves at an early date in what has been miscalled the \" new world.\" * Ausoba, or Ausona, is the ancient name of a river in the western region of Connaught near Nagnata or Gallina, mentioned by Ptolemy. Some think it to be the river Galvia [or rather the Suck] in Galway ; others Lough Corbes, [or rather Cor rib]. The name is, however, almost universally supposed to mean \"a frith,\" from the old Britannic words, Auise aba, an \" eruption of water,\" or the old Irish words, Ause obba, of the same import, (Collect, de reb. Heb. iii. p. 284). To my mind both names appear Ph\u0153nician. Ausoba, from auz ob, means a narrow bay. Ausona, from aus-en, a resounding river, rich in water. In that part of Spain called Farsaconeses, the Hes pania Citerior of the Romans, in the canton of the Ilergetes, between Manresa and Gerunda, beside the river Sambroca, there stood an ancient city called Ausona, or Ausa, which"], [77, "41 t)aurona,* Iernus,f Isammum,J Laberus,\u00a7 Macoli cum,|| Ovoca,\"^[ &c. ; and to crown all, \"Even the few gave name to the people called Ausetani. Being destroyed by the Arabians, after their invasion of that country, and restored to its original level, itwas called Vicus Auson\u0153, and by the natives, \"Vich de Osona, now merely Vich. There is, also, in the cauton of the Asturas, a chain of mountains called Ausona ; in Canta bria we find Mount Ausa ; in Boetica the city of Osuna; in the Country of the Vacedi are the towns Ausejoand Ausiues; in Cel tiberia the volley of Auso ; and other names of this kind, of Ph\u0153 nician birth, which borrow their names from the adjacent rivers. * Daurona is derived from the Ph\u0153nician words duron, a wealthy people. Spain had an old city in the canton of the Celtiberians called Duron, and the ruins of which are to be seen to this day. But the name of the river Duro in Spain, as well as of the river Dour in the county Cork (or rather county Kerry, called now, the Mang,) in Ireland, comes from the Celtic word deir, a river. f Iernus, (now Kenmare river,) either from the Ph\u0153nician Ierain, pious, religious, or from the Greek lerne, corrupted, as we shall shew in a subsequent chapter, from the Ph\u0153nician Iherin, and intimating Ireland.

It may happen, indeed, in spite of us, and to our great detriment, I allow, that we may sometimes meet with obscure, nay, inexplicable, terms amongst the names given of old to some of our states, our cities, our rivers, or our mountains ; but this will be found, for the most part, to have occurred through the fault of historians and antiquarians mystifying words otherwise clear, and arbitrarily affixing to them whatever meaning may have been first sug gested by either their caprice or their ignorance. How much more temperately, and at the same time more correctly, does that celebrated Irish historian, O'Connor, in his Rer. Iber. script, vet. 1, p. xlvi. seq. express himself on this head. \" If we but com pare,\" says he, \" the Irish names handed down by Ptolemy, severally, with the British, and afterwards with the Spanish names which he has also preserved, section of Ireland, named by Ptolemy, and by some supposed to be the river Arklow, by others the Dublin Bay, is derived from the Ph\u0153nician voe, he emptied, he evacuated ; whence the Arabic obec, or abic, a water-conduit, a pipe whereby water is conveyed into a bath."], [79, "43 we must needs acknowledge that by far the greater part of them are Spanish, bearing reference to times of the most distant date, and as such accord with those accounts which we have heard respecting the very early landing of the Ph\u0153nicians in this ' holy island.' \"* This erudite writer accordingly steered clear of the opinion of those who, pinning their faith upon some would-be antiquarians, affirm that almost all the names of our ancient tribes and colonists cor respond with the genius of the native idiom, and must therefore be derived therefrom. Other critics, with more chastened taste, and no small degree of merit, derive them in part from the Celtic, in part from the Cambrian, in part, too, from the Cambrian and the old Teutonic ; but neither with these do I agree in all particulars, seeing that they would fain grub out from other sources, and no matter at what pains or cost, what I am convinced in my soul are derived from the spirit of the Ph\u0153nician language, and from that only.

The truth is these gentlemen, with all their learn ing, have not sufficiently sifted the rubbish of the Ph\u0153nician language, preserved and perpetuated in those names by the peasantry themselves, though knowing nothing, as we may suppose, of the authors of the contrivance ; and this observation! have had occasion to make before upon the geographical names of Spain, which, in my treatise upon the geo graphy of that country, I have attempted to prove as emanating from the same source. And as it must be admitted on all hands that the marksman who aims at the object itself, however distant or elevated, is less likely to miss the line of direction, than he who would be content with grazing the circular superficies, therefore have I ventured to launch my vessel at once into the depths of the Ph\u0153nician fountains, there to explore, and mayhap with success, * See Essay on the Antiquity of the Irish Language, being a collation of the Irish with the Punic.

The neglect of this on the part of a writer* who has otherwise shewn consummate information on Irish affairs, leads him to suspect that the Ph\u0153nicians did only occasionally touch upon the Irish coasts for the purposes of commerce, both export and import ; and that in the course of time, Britain, by reason of its wealthy tins mines, holding out to them more commercial inducements, became, consequently, a more favorite rendezvous. Here he thinks it pro bable that they built themselves temporary huts, in the capacity of purveyors for merchant's cargoes : and these abodes, he conceives, not to have lasted beyond the period of the third Punic war, when Car thage J was destroyed, and Spain laid claim to by the Romans. * Vallancey, Collect, de Reb.

The precise time of its founda tion is unknown ; yet writers seem to agree that it was about 869 years before the Christian era, or according to others, 72 or 93 years before the foundation of Rome.

For upwards of two hundred and forty years, those two nations had beheld with secret distrust each other's power, till at length a pretext occurred for removing the mask, and the declaration of hos tilities was the inevitable consequence of their inbred hatred. The two first Punic wars had passed away, and the combatants on both sides \u2014 kept in check by the vigilance of their mutual operations \u2014 had covered themselves with glory and military immortality; but in the third, the levelling maxim of Cato, who saw that the peace of Italy could never be secured so long as the capital of Africa had a being, gave a dreadful impetus to the Roman perfidy and dishonour. During seventeen days Carthage was in flames, and the soldiers were permitted to redeem from the fire whatever possessions they could lay hold of.

Being asked by the historian Polybius to what he then applied his prediction, \" To my country,\" replied Scipio, \"for her too I dread the vicissi tude of human affairs, lest in her turn she may exhibit another faming Carthage.\" This event happened about the year of Rome 606."], [83, "47 Celts and Ancient Britons, are to be traced to a much higher quarter, namely, the language of the Ph\u0153nicians, who in the very earliest days, that is much about the time of the entrance of the Israelites into the land of Canaan, penetrated as far, in the first instance, as the coasts of Africa and Spain, and thence \u2014 their ambition increasing with the success of their enterprises \u2014 they extended their researches even to the Irish shores.

The chief advantage which humble diligence and diffident sagacity can derive from the labors of able antecedent writers is this, that from their priority in point of time they may be considered as our torch-bearers through the thick and dis couraging darkness of ages in the distance ; yet should we not so fix our eyes upon them, as they thus precede us in the way, as to omit all attention on our part to the safety of our own footsteps.

Had the Irish asserted a descent from the Carthaginians, the want of such inscriptions and coins would be conclusive against them ; but as the learned Lord Ross (then Sir L.

I am convinced also, that the plain of Fermoy \u2014 called in the \" Annals of Innisfallen \" the \" Plain of the Ph\u0153nicians\" \u2014 was not so denominated without a just and good cause, seeing that in this district we meet with stone pillars erected after the Ph\u0153nician fashion, in plains and upon little hillocks, in great numbers, and of almost monstrous proportions. In this opinion, therefore, I unhesitatingly acquiesce, in preference to that of a writer already alluded to, who has asserted that there are no vestiges of either citadels or old temples to be found in Ireland at this day that could properly be attributed to the Ph\u0153nician era.

This laborious and stupendous piece of workmanship is deservedly ascribed to the Ph\u0153 nicians, after their expulsion by Joshua, and was in tended, no doubt, either for the worship of some idol, or to pepetuate the memory of some hero there interred. The Irish call this structure Leaba-chaillde, meaning thereby Callid's couch, for \" leaba \" in Irish signifies a couch or bed ; but who this Callid was, no one that I can discover, even soothsayer or prophet, hath ever asserted or dared to guess ; much less can it be ascertained from the interpretation of the populace who understand by the term the \" old hag's bed.\" In support however of this explanation, it is alledged that is, the flag of the Deity, being an immense flat stone, supported by pedestals, and sometimes, where the ground was sufficiently high, or where the weight of the incumbent stone rendered it too difficult to remove it, without any pedestals; nor the hypog\u00e6 or antra Mithr\u00e6, being subterraneous vaults, of which the most astonishing yet discovered is tfoat at \" New Grange,\" corrupted from Grein-Uagh, i. e.cave of the sun or Mithras, in the county of Meath.

With all respect, however, to the distinguished in dividuals who think thus, and otherwise, I am inclined to imagine that Leaba-Chaillde is a Ph\u0153nician expres sion, slightly vitiated, and composed of the words lehab shallaid, a burned corpse, indicating the grave of some illustrious hero deceased and buried therein.* For lehab, in the Ph\u0153nician language, is a flame, whence zalehab, to burn, and shallaid is a corpse, or trunk of a dead body.

But what if it should appear that Feine was a name given not to any individual Ph\u0153nician, but in general to any chieftain or leader ?

Principles of this nature, should strike deep into our minds, when we consider the state of the heathen world, and, at the same time, reflect on the many blessings we enjoy. In vain do we pride ourselves in any of our endow ments, in vain do we pretend to superior attainments; for if our affections are as much attached to earthly objects as those of the heathens, then we are much more inexcusable than they. We have all the truths of the gospel laid open to us, while they remain in a state of ignorance, worshipping the works of their own hands. Nay, worshipping even reptiles and insects, offering human sacrifices, shutting up their bowels of compassion, aud trampling upon every moral obligation.

But my present design being to illustrate the names of the several localities of this country, as serted already and maintained to have been of Ph\u0153ni cian birth, I shall begin from its very first settlers, whose tribes it will be shewn have borrowed their names from that language ; and in this retrospective view the island itself claims our first regard, as known both to foreigners and to natives under va rious appellatives. By the natives it was called Inis nab fiodha, by which they would intimate the \" island of woods ;\" in which sense it was also called Inis fiod, the \" island of timber \" or trees, from fiod, timber, and inis, an island ; and again, crioca frindh, the final wood ; from croch, a boundary, and fridh, a wood.* It may have happened, indeed, that subsequent * I never saw one hundred contiguous acres in Ireland in which there were not evident signs that they were once wood, or, at least, very well wooded. Trees and the roots of trees, of"], [96, "60 settlers, from ignorance of their true meaning, endea voured to accommodate to the spiritof their own lan guage these names and terms which they found ready to their hand, and sanctioned by the usage of their predecessors ; but as to their being originally Ph\u0153nician, that is indisputable and beyond the pos sibility of doubt. Inis nab fiodha is compounded, as before observed, of the words, Inis, an island ; nab, of ; and fiod, a wood : Inis, again, is composed of the Ph\u0153nician words, In-is, meaning idolatrous inhabitants, of intrepidity and spirit \u2014 in or un being idolatry, and is, an inhabitant of manly spirit ; whilst the two latter words, nab-fiodah, are properly derived from the Ph\u0153nician naboa, an origin, and phiobd, those who dwelt in a vanquished land. So that Inis-nab-fiodah conveyed to the Ph\u0153nicians the following idea, viz. who dwelt originally in a van quished land, or the posterity of those who sojourn ed in a country which they took by conquest. the largest size, are dug up in all the bogs ; and in the culti vated countries, the stumps of trees destroyed show that the destruction has not been of any ancient date : a vast number of Irish names for hills, mountains, valleys, and plains, have forests, woods, groves, or trees, for their signification. The greatest part of the kingdom now exhibits a naked, bleak, dreary view, for want of wood, which has been destroyed for a century past, with thoughtless prodigality, and still continues to be cut and wasted, as if it were not worth the preservation. \u2014 Young."], [97, "61 Fiod Inis, from the Ph\u0153nician words, fiot inis, that is, idolatrous inhabitants who deprecate, for fiot means deprecation.

I pass over to the vulgar, yet most ancient names given to Ireland, such as Ere Fodhla, and Banba, borrowed, as some historians aver, from three royal sisters, the last queens of the Tuatha Dedan, to which Fiech* the Scholiast adds two others, Fail and Elga. But it is not safe trusting to fabulous records wrapt up in darkness and unsubstantiated by proof ; more especially when we may otherwise account for the origin of these words by tracing them to the spi rit of the Ph\u0153nician language \u2014 for Ere comes from araa or eree, a country, a climate, the inhabitants of one region.

Nor need we wonder if some of these should have so named this island, as they had formerly all Africa,* whose western parts, namely, and naturally polished surface, and of a pure and charming green, without any mixture of any other color : Fair as the glittering waters Thy emerald banks that lave, To me thy graceful daughters, Thy generous sons as brave. Oh ! there are hearts within thee Which know not shame or guile, And such proud homage win thee \u2014 My own green isle ! \u2014 Barton. * In ancient times, this country was considered as a third part of the terrestrial globe, and it may be properly called a peninsular ; for were it not for that small tract of land running between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, it would actually be an island. It is remarkable, that in ancient times there were many christians here, who had fair and flourishing churches, and here some of the most eminent christian fathers resided ; among these were Cyprian, bishop of Carthage ; Austin, bishop of Hippo; and Tertullian, the famous apolo gist. These African churches continued to flourish til! about the middle of the seventh century, when the Arabians, under their caliphs, established Mahometanism in many parts, such as Egypt, Morocco, Algiers, &c. but at present, the greater number of the inhabitants are idolators.

This opinion they have formed, not more from the distant recesses of time which the Irish explore in their historical inves tigations, than from the well known practice of the poets, giving \u2014 from Ogyges the most ancient king of Thebes \u2014 the name of Ogygia to any thing that is ancient. * Some would have Egypt on this account * More especially if such antiquity be involved in darkness and in doubt, as every thing relating to the origin of this king, the age in which he lived, and the duration of his reign, con fessedly is.

For the Ph\u0153nicians who had begun to frequent in distant voyages the uttermost part of either ocean, and who, as Strabo mentions, having proceeded even beyond the \"pillarsf of Hercules,\" had circumnavigated the greater part of the habitable globe, finding the earth on every side encompassed by that watery expanse o'er whose bosom they were wafted to their enterprising destinations, very signi ficantly gave the name of \" hag\" to that \" watery ex- dixeris ab Ogyge vetustissimo. \u2014 Rhodogonus, lib. 15, cap. 33. iS'ee Pint, lib de facia in orbe lun\u0153.

It is worthy of note too, that hag, which is common as well to the Hebrews as the Ph\u0153nicians, occurs in scripture as a cosmographical term, used by Isaiah (xi. 22.) to express emphatically the circle of the earth, and by Solomon* to indicate the circle above the face of the abyss.f But the foregoing interpretation must not make us treat with contempt, nor fancy it a dream on the part of those who imagine that by the name of \" Ogygia\" allusion is made to the bloody victims which the Druids and other sacrificing priests, introduced by the Ph\u0153nicians into this country, used offer to their idols according to the Syriac custom in Ireland, no less than in Spain, and Gaul, and other nations of those denominated Gentiles. For in the Ph\u0153nician language, og-igiah means grief or sorrow for one burned, being compounded of og, he burned, and igiah, he made sorrowful. Whence the valley near Jerusalem wherein Tophet was situated, and in which fire was perpetually preserved for burning the * Proverbs viii. 27. f Bochart Geog. i. 36."], [103, "67 offals and bones of the dead bodies therein sacrificed, \u2014 sons, by the way, whom their very parents used to immolate to the idol Moloch, dragging them with their own hands through two funeral pyles until death interfered in mercy to their excruciations \u2014 was called gia or gianon, from that horrifying abomination. By this too is confirmed the belief of the Ph\u0153nicians having made it a custom to preserve fire \" inextin guishable\" in the temples of their gods, as Silius as serts of the temple of Gades or Cades, which they had there erected and devoted to Hercules. * The \" evil spirit,\" no doubt, the great enemy of the human species, and consequently the rival of Jehovah, in this the weakest quarter of the universal created scheme, had his priests also to preserve his fire in the temples of his idols, so as to appear not interior to the people of Israel whom God had enjoined to feed the fire continually upon the altar. Hence the Greeks at Delphi and at Athens, used to preserve it both night and day ; and if ever, by any accident, it got extinguished, they used to light it again by the rays of the sun. The Pyrea of the Persians are also well known, in which they used not only to preserve the fire in an everlasting blaze, but even worship it as a divi- * Under this appellation was typified the sun, the twelve labors of the ' ' hero,\" being nothing more than a figurative repre. sentation of the annual course of that, luminary through the twelve signs of the zodiac. \u2014 See Porp.

This custom penetrated even to India, to the Brahmins themselves, who, we have the authority of Arumianus for saying, \" used to guard the fire on hearths ever burning.\" But the superstition had its origin with the sacrificing priests of the Syrians, who were wont in honour of Moloch to drag their own children through heaps of fire, t This dragging amounted in some instances to an actual burning of children ; sometimes only to a scorching, produced by their being either conducted * Brison de regno Persarum. f This country \u2014 once so immersed in profligacy and vice as to share in the dishonor of the proverbial alliteration of the Greek, \" tria kappa kakista,\" the Cretans and the Cilicians being the other two of the trio, was notwithstanding, ennobled by being the birth place of Strabo, and of many martyrs and heroes, such as Gregory Nazoenzen, Gregory Nysson, and St. Basil, not forgettiirg the celebrated St. George, who had been a tribune of soldiers (colonel) under the emperor Dioclesian, and afterwards appointed patron of the order of the garter by Edward III, all of whom shed a lustre over the history of the place, and redeem its character though almost irreparable.

Comar, or cumar, as also mar, meant, with the Chaldeans and Syrians, a gentile priest, a camillus, or minister of idols ; whence the Syriac word cumaruth, priesthood, and the rabinical cumari, a monk. But they were so denominated from the burning of victims, for with the people of the east camar means to burn. There are those, however, who think that the verb \" to drag across,\" when used in this acceptation, is equivalent in import with the verb to \"burn.\" Vossius is of opinion that when the scriptures make mention of this dragging, \" burning\" is not thereby implied, but merely \" conducting\" between two fires. Never theless, he acknowledges that independently of this scorching, which prevailed in all families, no matter how affluent, or strangers to want, there was also a live-burning of their dearest pledges, and from the very flower of the people too, whereby, in the mad ness of their superstition, they had cajoled themselves into a belief that their deities could be propitiated on occasions of great calamites. That this was the opinion of the Ph\u0153nicians is evident from Porphyry.* We learn from Scripture, * The original name of this writer and philosopher, and greatest enemy, in both capacities, that Christianity ever ex perienced, was Melek, which in the Syriac language signifies"], [106, "70 also, that this worship had obtained throughout the land of Canaan* and Mediterranean Syria, which comprehended Ph\u0153nicia within its extensive boun daries.

Others derive it from rodon, a rose, for which, as well as snakes, the island was remarkable, and adduce, in confirmation, several Rhodian coins, exhibiting the sun, to which the island was sacred, on one side, and a rose on the other. But this was a mistake of the moderns not knowing the Ph\u0153nician origin of the word Rhod, and wresting it to the resemblance of their own rodon, corroborated somewhat by the accident of finding of a rose-bud of brass in laying the founda tion of the ancient city of Lindus.

Nay it rather proves the contrary, for there is some thing in every man's conscience which points out to him that he has offended God, and that some attonement must be made, either by himself or by another. Now these heathens in India believe, that an attonement has been made for their sins, and they are to have the choice of enjoying the benefits of it, on two conditions : either they are to visit several holy cities at a vast distance from each other, or secondly, they are declared to be absolved, in consequence of their repeating the names of their gods, twenty-iour times every day. Such as visit the holy places, offer up a sacrifice ; and on the tail of the victim is written the name of the penitent, with the nature of his offence.

Some suppose that they were some of the aboriginal Britons, and that they arrived in Ireland much about the same time as the Nemeth\u00e6, that is, as they say, in the sixth century before the birth of Christ.

With these gigantic aborigines they tell us that the Partholani waged an in cessant and bloody course of warfare, and with such acrimony on both sides, that both were almost * See Collect, de Reb. lbern. vol. iii. p. 404. f See O'Flaherty, cap. ii. p. 3.

As I take it, the Partholani are the most an cient, or, if you prefer, the primitive tribes of the Ph\u0153nicians who landed on the Irish coasts, and from them was given the name of Partulin to all such as had transported themselves from their native country. The Syriac word para, signifies to sprout or shoot \u2014 tulin, number or plurality, from tul, translation. But para means also he grew or en creased, so that partulin would then mean a body of emigrants who encreased and multiplied. This race the ancient Irish poets and historians call Fomhoraigh, Formhoraice, and Formoragh ; by which word, they think, is meant pirates, or transma rine robbers, infesting those coasts in prejudice to, and defiance of, the ancient colonies ; and they assert that they were decended from Ham or Midacritus * from Africa, with the exception of the first Formorii, to whom they assign neither other sect nor origin, f * Pliny (vii. v. 6.) tells us that Midacritus was the first who had imported lead from the island of Cassiterides. But later critics assure us that this was no other than Melicartus, or the Ph\u0153nician Hercules, mentioned in Sanchoniathon, to whom the Ph\u0153nicians ascribed so many voyages to the west. Mi dacritus is in itself a Greek name, and we know that the Greeks were in total ignorance of the locality of the Cassiterides. \u2014 See Bochart. f O'Flaherty, i. p. 9."], [121, "85 Some suppose them to have been Celts ; others, more correctly, Ph\u0153nicians, which the name itself would seem to indicate.* For, in their language, famori, means the lord of an extreme land, that is of an island, which they had supposed to be the utmost habitation of the globe, as we have observed conformably to the opinion of Bochart. The Ne meth\u00e6 or Nemetii, were, as some say, the posterity of Nemethus,f who, they maintain, planted a second colony in Ireland thirty years after the death of Partholanus, when it had now become almost a desert and been overrun with forests.

But expunging altogether the fables of the old poets, to me it appears incontrovertible that the name of Nemeth\u00e6 was given by the Ph\u0153nicians to their tribes, as equivalent with pleasant, cheerful, or agreeable.

In Genesis ix. we read of Noah having got drunk with the fruit of the vine, and that while he was in a state of intoxication in his tent, Ham, his youngest son, came in and beheld his na kedness ; but Shem and Japhet went backwards and covered him. When Neah awoke, and found how different the beha viour of his sons had been, he said (verse 35) '' Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" Now Canaan is no where mentioned as the aggressor; but there cannot remain the least doubt, but he was, at that time, along with his father, and like Ham, mocked at the aged pa triarch ; a crime attended with many aggravated circumstances. But the deistical objection is this, \" It was inconsistent, say they, with the goodness of God, to inflict a curse on a nation in latter ages for the guilt of an ancestor. Now let every unpre judiced reader attend to the passage, and then he will find that the whole was a prediction, and not an imprecation.

Beyer (Selden de Diis Syrii) states that the inhabitants of Mexico, Vir ginia, and Bengal offered adoration to certain rivers aud foun tains; for the ancients imagined, according to Lipsius, that rivers and fountains were lesser divinities or genii. The Nile was worshiped with the most scrupulous veneration by the Egyptians. (See Plutarch and Athanasius.) For says Julius Firmicus, from the universal benefits of water they conceived it must be a god. Wherefore we find the poets calling rivers sacred, (Hor. lib. i. od. 1.

Finding, however, all their efforts to discover them by the force of reason vain, they have mutually resorted to the aid of that blind god, chance; and hence, omens from the flight of birds, from the entrails of sacri fices, have arisen : of this last I propose now to write to you. When a choice between two equal things was to be made, the referring it to chance by the casting of lots would obviously present itself as a fair mode of deciding, where the judgment was unequal to do so ; and we find, therefore, this among the most ancient usages recorded in the bible : thus Aaron cast lots for the scape-goat. The direction of these lots would, of course, be soon imputed to the divine pleasure of the Almighty observer and guider of all things, and it would then occur to the inquisitive that this mode might be adopted for looking into futurity. Accordingly we see that this superstitious practice was very quickly applied to such purposes, an instance of which is given in Esther, chap. iii. verse 7, where, when Hainan de sired to find out the most proper time to slay all the Jews, he ordered the pur to be cast, that is the lot, from day to day, and from month to month, and discovered that the thirteenth of the twelfth month was most favourable for his designs; but he was deceived, and the event proved the vanity of relying upon such divination. This mode, however, was too simple for the generality of men, and the custom next adopted was the mixing together of a number of letters'm an urn, throwing them out, and examining the arrangement in which they might fall; but as frequently no sense could be discovered from these, in lieu of letters whole words were adopted, and even here the answer was very often not to be understood. To obviate this, Cicero tells us that a variety of predictions were inscribed on pieces of wood, which were kept in a box, shaken, and one drawn out by a child ; he informs us how these were first dis covered, but observes, \" Tola res est inventio fallacis, ant ad"], [131, "95 language, bri or bari signifies a foreigner. And the practice of consecrating groves to the worship of idols, is established by innumerable testimonies from the ancient heathen writers. Virgil in his ninth \u00c6neid, introduces Cybele thus speaking of herself. \" On a lofty mount I have a grove, a piny wood, by me beloved for many a year \"* And Prudentius in the \" Roman martyr,\" says, \" shall I go to the piny grove of Cybele.\" qu\u0153stum, aut ad superstitionem.\" \" The whole matter is, how ever, fallacious every way.\" And in another place, in speaking of it, he says, \" Quibus in rebus temeritas et casus, non ratio et consilium valent.\" \" Chance, not reason, presides over these things.\" This mode of divination is continually spoken of by the writers of that age ; thus, Lucretius, \" Nequicquam Divum numen, sortesque fatigant.\" \" In vain they implore the Gods, and search the lots.\" And Ovid, \" Auxiliuin per sacras q\u00e6rere sortes.'' \" To seek for aid in the sacred lots,\" And again, \" Mota Dea est, sortcmque dedit.\" \"The goddess was moved, and granted a lot.\" Numberless other instances might be given of the frequency of the practice ; but, as the urn aud heaven-descended mystical pieces of wood were not always at hand, another mode was in vented throughout Greece and Italy which superseded their use. This was to take the words of some celebrated poet, as Homer, Euripides, or Virgil ; to open this book at hazard, and to re ceive as an oracle the first passage that met the eye ; these were termed \" Sortes Ilomeric\u0153,\" or \" Vigilan\u0153,'' Among the He brews too, there was a divination called Beth Cole. \u2014 Lim.

In the first ages of the world, the worship of God was exceedingly simple ; there were no temples, an altar composed sometimes of a single stone, or sometimes of turf, was all that was necessary : on this fire was lighted, and the sacrifice offered. Any place was equally proper, as they knew that the object of their worship filled the heavens and the earth. In process of time, when fa- milies increased, and many sacrifices were to be offered, groves or shady places were chosen, where the worshippers might en joy the protection of the shade, as a considerable time must be empoyed in offering many sacrifices. These groves became af- terwards abused to impure and idolatrous purposes, and were therefore strictly forbidden. See Exod. xxxiv. 12; Deut. xii. 3 ; xvi. 21.\u2014 Dr. A. Clarke. t Abraham, the father of the faithful, was called away from his native country, somewhat less than three hundred years after the deluge, which naturally leads us to inquire into the origin of idolatry. Abraham, as a wanderer and sojourner in a strange country, had not been above ten years absent from Ur, of the Chaldeans, when a famine obliged him to go into Egypt, at that time a very flourishing monarchy. That Egypt should have had a regal government within three hundred years after the deluge, has been objected to by many of our deistical writers; but when attentively considered, we cannot find any thing in it of an extraordinary nature.

We also rind in Genesis xiii. 18, that Abraham dwelt in the oaks (aloni) of Mamre, in Hebron, and there built an altar to the Lord. Afterwards also in Genesis, xiv. 13, he says, \" he dwelt beside the oaks of Mamre.\" All which passages the septuagint renders, peri ten drun, that is, about the oak. From hence the idolatrous Ca naanites began to consecrate oaks to their own divinities, and to worship in groves of that wood. The Ph\u0153nicians subsequently introduced the custom into Asia, Egypt, Africa, and the continent of Eu rope, with the British isles. Ovid, speaking of the oak, calls it \" sacred to Jove.\" Virgil says \" it was accounted an oracle by the Grecians.\" And Homer says the same in Od. xix.* fore they had attained to years of maturity ; so that there is no reason for us to be surprised, when we find the children of Mizraim founding a monarchy, in the fertile plains of Egypt, as soon as a sufficient number of the human species had been collected together. \u2014 Hurd. * See W.

The Ph\u0153nicians were a remnant of the ancient Canaanites. who were suffered by the Divine Being, to remain unextirpated, that they should be a scourge upon the children of Israel, as often as they relapsed into idol atry. In scripture they are often mentioned, as a warlike people, under the name of Philistines, for the word Ph\u0153nice is Greek. They inhabited that part of Asia adjoining to the Mediterranean sea, and worshipped an idol named Dagon, much in the same form as a mermaid is represented by the fa bulous writers ; a human body from the navel upwards, aud the lower part that of a fish. The figure itself was very expressive ; for it pointed out, not only their situation near the sea, but H 2"], [136, "100 worships, I shall now detail my sentiments respecting the derivation of the geographical names just alluded to.

Invaded in their continental territories by the neighbouring na tions, they settled in an island near adjoining, which they called Tyre; and there remained in possession of it till the time of Alexander the Great. As a trading people, they sent colonies into Africa : but most of these were comprehended under the name of Carthagenians ; and such regard had Tyre and Car thage for each other, that when Cambyses resolved to make war upon the latter, the Ph\u0153nicians refused to accompany him ; alledging in excuse, that they could not fight against their brethren, which obliged that prince to lay aside his design. Nay, the Carthagenians sent an annual tribute to the Tyrians, part of which was for the support of the civil government, and part for the maintainance of the priests and religion. The religion of the Carthagenians, which was the same as that of the Tyrians, Ph\u0153nicians, Philistines, and Canaanites, was most horrid and barbarous ; and so regular were they in practising what will ever dishonour human nature, that Chris tians, in attending to their duty, may take an example from them Nothing of any moment was undertaken without con sulting the gods, which they did by a variety of ridiculous rites and ceremonies. Hercules was the god in whom they placed most confidence, at least he was the same to them as Mars was to the Romans, so that he was invoked before they went upon any expedition ; and when they obtained a victory, sacri fices and thanksgivings were offered to him. * According to the notions of the Indian heathens, the"], [137, "101 Crom-mal, from Cram-mala, a congregation of people in a grove or shrubbery of the deity Fate.

It is a principle acquired by experience without reading, that in every act of devotion the mind should be fixed on the grand object of worship. Every one who has walked in a grove will acknowledge, that there was more than a com mon reverential awe upon his mind, which must be owing to the small number of objects that presented themselves. We may justly call them the haunts of meditation ; but still it cannot be denied, that many abominable crimes were com mitted in them : some parts near their altars were set apart for secret lewdness, and even for such unnatural practices as ought not to be related.\u2014 Hurd."], [139, "103 in a celebrated grotto ;\u2014 as well as upon the other names by which this deity was distinguished.* A learned gentleman, and a shrewd searcher into the Ph\u0153nician idolatry, suspected once that Ops was to the Ph\u0153nicians the same as Apis, not that which Tibullusf calls the Memphian Bull,J and which the Memphians consecrated to the moon, but that which the Heliopolites had consecrated to the sun.\u00a7 * See chap. vii. t Tibul. lib. iii. eleg. 7. X The most magnificent temples were erected for him ; he was adored by all ranks of people while living, and when he died (for he was a living Bull) all Egypt went into mourning for him. We are told by Pliny, that, during the reign of Ptolemy Lagus, the Bull Apis died of extreme old age, and such was the pompous manner in which he was interred, that the funeral expences amounted to a sum equal to that of twelve thousand pounds sterling. The next thing to be done, was to provide a successor for this god, and all Egypt was ransacked on purpose. He was to be distinguished by certain marks from all other animals of his own species ; particularly he was to have on his forehead a white mark, resembling a crescent ; on his back the figure of an eagle ; and on his tongue that of a beetle. As soon as an ox answering that description was found, mourning gave place to joy ; and nothing was to be heard of in Egypt but festivals and rejoicings. The new discovered god, or rather beast, was brought to Memphis, to take possession of his dignity, and there placed upon a throne, with a great number of ceremonies. Indeed, the Egyptians seem to have given such encouragement to superstition, that not content with worshipping the vilest of all reptiles, (hey actually paid divine honors to vegetables. \u00a7 Voss. de orig. et progress, idolat. 1. 29."], [140, "104 For the Ph\u0153nicians also worshipped the sun under the name of Baal, or Bel, by which, as the Assyrians and Babylonians, they understood, physically, the whole system of nature, as well terrestrial as celes tial, and above all, the solar nature, as Servius tells us. They, accordingly, very appropriately gave to the sun the name of Belus, as the Moabites did that of Moloch. For as this latter appellation sig nifies King, so does Baal, or Bel, signify Lord, as though the arbiter of all the blessings of nature. Wherefore, also, did they call him Bolatis, or Bolati. from the words Bol-ati, which means Baal,* or the Lord, who bestows.f But this Baal being distin guished by various names, it hence happened that, in Scripture, the Israelites are blamed for serving Baals, in the plural number. This seems to have occurred in other countries also, for the Bolg\u00e6, a colony of the Ph\u0153nicians in Ireland, worshipped, as * But of all the gods of the Syrians and Canaanites, none were honored so much as Baal, who was no other than the Belus of the Chaldeans, and the Jupiter of the Greeks. It is probable the sun was worshipped under this name ; for Josiah, willing to make some atonement for the sins of his father Mauasseh, in worshipping Baal and all the host of heaven, put to death the idolatrous priests that burnt incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. He likewise took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, and burnt the chariots of the sun with fire. \u2014 Hurd. t See Damascus in the life of Isidorus Photius."], [141, "105 we shall hereafter shew, the sun, or the principle of fire, as a deity, under various names. The name of Bolg\u00e6 is compounded of the Ph\u0153nician words Bol goi, meaning the nation that worships Bol, or Baal ; as Belg\u00e6 is compounded of the words Bel-goi, amounting to the same. From whence the Bolg\u00e6 and the Belg\u00e6 were at first called by the Latins Bolgii and Belgii ; afterwards the Bolgian and the Belgian nations ; and finally, as we now call them, the Bolg\u00e6 and the Belg\u00e6. From this cause it was that the writer, above alluded to, conceived Ops the same as Apis, which the Hieropolitans had conse crated to the sun. Indeed I would think this conjecture probable enough, were it not evident, from another source, that Ops was one of the names of Cybele, reputed by idolators as the daughter of Heaven and Earth, and designated as the Mother of the Gods, the Good Mother, and the Earth itself.* Wherefore * Pliny (11, 65.) affirms that the Gentiles worshipped the earth under the name of Mother, and not only Mother but great Mother, because of its bountifulness. For this it was that they called her the eternal creator of men and gods, (Stat. Chebaid. viii. v. 304,) chief parent, and other such epithets; for having fallen away into idolatry from the religion of the patriarchs, who offered sacrifices to the true God through faith in the pro mised Messiah, and having thus contaminated the original purity of the knowledge of the Godhead, they worshipped the elements, from which they conceived all things to have been realized, either as actual divinities or symbols of divinities, and"], [142, "106 the Romans worshipped her under the name of Vesta, as being clothed in the beauty of her own manifold productions,* according as some imagine ;f though others would account for it otherwise. J Un der this latter name she had two temples at Rome,\u00a7 one built by Romulus, the other by Numa Pom pilius, in the mid space between the Capitoline and Palatine hills, both hills being surrounded by one wall. Her temples were always round, in allusion of course to the earth's form. Others would derive the name of Ops from the Egyptian word hop, a serpent ; others from the Hebrew apoe, a viper ; whence the Greek ophis, a snake, the root of which is poe, or phoe, to hiss. But this has nothing common, or in connection with the fables which mythology tells us of this divinity.

Camden mentions to have seen one of her altars in Britain. * Quippe qu\u00e6 rebus omnibus vestitur. f See Lud. Despre,. on the Odes of Hor. lib. i. od. 2. I Cicero de Nat.

She was called Din dymena, from the mountain Dindemain, which means, olive groves in an eastern quarter ; and Bere cynthia, from breschin, or bereschin, a fir or pine grove. But our decision on the word Sibbol, a name by which the Irish, as well as almost all other nations, designated and worshipped Ops, or Cybele, must be guided altogether by another principle For here I at once recognize the Syriac character as derived from sibola, an ear of corn, under which guise the Ph\u0153nicians used to worship the earth as the mother of all harvests, fruits, and vegetables. All nations, therefore, by one common consent, represented Cybele holding in her right hand some ears of corn* * Vossius states that there was at Rome, in the house which belonged to Cardinal C\u00e6sius, a marble altar, on which stood a statue of Cybele, with a tower upon her head, and holding millet and ears of corn in her right hand. The inscription was, \" To the Great Idean, Mother of the Gods.\" Many imagine that, in allusion to the same principle, she was called Rhea ; not from the mountain of that name, in Persia, but from the Ph\u0153nician reah, he yielded fodder ; whence rei, pasture : the metaphori cal signification of reah is, he obtained dominion. She was called Idean from id or ida, power."], [144, "108 Whence the Greeks gave her the name of Cubele, and the Latins that of Cybele. She was called Ama from the Ph\u0153nician word, am, a mother, and Mammon, from mammon, riches, or wealth, as the bestower of all blessings. The name of Anagh, by which she was also dis- tinguished, may refer, if you please, to the groves wherein she was worshipped ; for Anagh means de- light, or to be delighted, of course, with such worship. But I would prefer deriving it from nahag, he ruled, or governed ; for, as the daughter of Earth and Heaven, and the mother, besides, of the gods, Ops may be well supposed invested with no ordinary share of authority, in directing the affairs of the world. The Isle of Annagh, which lies between the island of Achil and the coast of the county Mayo, in the province of Connaught, takes its name from this ; as does also a little town of the same name near Charleville, in the county Cork ; and Annagh- uan an island adjacent to the county Gal way, intimating, as it were, a people who worshipped Anagh : for the Ph\u0153nicians used, synechdocally, to call the inhabit- ants of any particular district by the generic name of \" ben.\" Nor can I see any objection to the derivation of the names of these places from the giant Anac, the son of Arbas,* from whom the Ph\u0153nicians were * Joshua xv. 13, 14.

Whence to this day, in the old Irish ballads, Feineagh means a champion, or heroic warrior. * At such time as Robert Vere, Earl of Oxford, was in the Barons warres against King Richard the Second, through the mallice of the Peeres, banished the realroe and proscribed, he with his kinsman, Fitz-Ursula, fled into Ireland, where being prosecuted, and afterwards in England put to death, his kins man there remaining behinde in Ireland rebelled, and, con spiring with the Irish, did quite castoff both their English name and alleagiance, since which time they have so remained still, and have since beene counted meere Irish. The very like is also reported of the Mac-swines, Mac-mahones, and Mac shehies of Mounster, how they likewise were aunciently Eng lish, and old followers to the Earle of Desmond, untill the raigne of King Edward the Fourth; at which time the Earle of Desmond that then was, called Thomas, being through false subornation (as they say) of the Quetne for some offence by her against him conceived, brought to his death at Tredagh most unjustly, notwithstanding that he was a very good and sound subject to the King. Thereupon all his kinsemen of the Geraldines, which then was a mighty family in Mounster, in revenge of that huge wrong, rose into armes against the King, and utterly renounced and forsooke all obedience to the Crowne of England, to whom the said Mac-swines, Mac-shehies, and Mac-mahones, being then servants and followers, did the like, and have ever sithence so continned.

Shabana evi dently comes from shaban, abundance, which again is derived from shabaa, he abounded ; all obviously in keeping with mercantile views and attendance on the market-place.

It is now God; and that they were to trust in his mercy through the mediation of a Redeemer, who was to be revealed to them at a future period of time ; for the necessity of a mediator between God and man was a general notion from the beginning. But as no clear revelation was then made of this Divine person, the people began to choose mediators for themselves, from among the heavenly bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, whom they considered as in a middle state between God and men. This was the origin of all the idolatry in the heathen world ; and at first they worshipped those orbs themselves, but as they found that they were as often under the horizon as above it, they were at a loss how to address them in their absence. To remedy this, they had recourse to making images, which after their consecration they believed endowed with Divine power, and this was the origin of image worship. This religion first began among the Chaldeans, and it was to avoid being guilty of idolatry that Abraham left that country. In Persia, the first idolaters were called Sabians, who adored the rising sun with the profoundest veneration. To that planet they consecrated a most magnificent chariot, to be drawn by horses of the greatest beauty and magnitude, on every solemn festi val.

To suppose, then, that the Caucasian Iberi had gone into Spain, and given to that country the name of Iberia, I hesitate not to proneunce as nonsense the most absurd, though supported by the authority of Varro,* and sanctioned by the adoption of Apian-f and Diodorus Siculus. J No ; the origin of Iberia must be sought from another source. \u00a7 Eber, in the Hebrew, and Ebra or Ibra, in the Chaldee, signify a passing over, or any thing remote or far away ; their plurals, Ibrin or Ebrin, signify boundaries or limits : the Spaniards, therefore, were very naturally called Iberi, being, as the Ph\u0153nicians imagined, the very remotest inhabitants of the earth, and their city, Calpe, the furthermost spot in their opinion of the habitable globe. || Conformable to this is the character given by Possidonius to the temple of Hercules, in Gades or Cadiz, calling it \" the bound ary of the earth and sea.\"^[ From the same reason the Jews would have Gaul and Spain to be the boundaries of their own land.

Finally, the Spaniards, themselves, have long since given the name of Finis Terr\u00e6,f or land's end, to the Nerian or Celtic promontory in Artabria. A city and district of the same country, in the district of Compostella, still preserves its name of land's end \u2014 Finisterre. Others suppose that the Spaniards were called Iberi, from the river Iber; just as Egypt got its name from the river Nile, which Homer designates \u2014 Egyptus. Iber, the name of the river, signifies in the Ph\u0153nician, rapidly flowing. J * Psalms lxxi. 8. f Some Spaniards derive this name from the Ce\\ticfin-es-tere, that is, a fair and fertile mountain. As they do, also, the names of the towns, Finestras, in the Celtiberi, and Finestrat, in the Edetani, from the Celtic fin-es-tra, a village on a hill beside a river. t The river Iber rises in the district of the Cantabrians, hard by Juliobriga, and flows by the ancient Vetones and Vascones, dividing the Ilergates from the Editani. Avienus (in Oris Maritimis) mentions another Iberus, near the ocean, to the west of the former, being no more than a stream mid way between B\u0153tis and Anas, now called Rio Tinto, or de Aceche ; these are his words : \u2014 \" Iberus inde manat amnis, et locos F\u0153cundat unda.

But though the Iberi were, properly speaking, the more remote,* yet the ancient geographical writers accounted the Spaniards, indiscriminately, as the most distant people ; which gave rise to the fiction, on the part of the poets, of the sun's setting not only in the ocean, but more particularly in the river Iber, thereby to mark out the extremity of the earth's extent.f The Iberia, therefore, of the ancient Irish took its name from the tribes of the Iberi of Spain, and consisted of that tract of country in the environs of Beerhaven, in the county of Cork ; the families of which people would seem to have been the original inhabitants of the county Kerry, and a part of the county Clare, in the same province, J where we still find the barony of Ibrickin, a proof of the * Hence we may infer, that the B\u0153tic Iberi, of whom Avienus speaks, were more properly so called Iberi, for they were the most extreme in respect to Spain in geneial. f Bochart i. 35.

This would account for the appear ance of this word, as the last syllable of Iberi-kin : and who is it that does not know the avidity of the Ph\u0153nicians to perpetuate their nobility, and the fondness of delight with which they dwelt upon every memorial of the glory of their ancestors ? Or, Kin might be equivalent with Kini, that is the Cinn\u00e6i, a people in the land of Canaan, who were also called the Cinn\u00e6an race.f And this would seem supported by the names of certain localities still preserved in this country ; for instance, that of Cinneich, the residence of Deri-iott Mac Carthy, J Esq. * Judges i. 16. f Judges iv. 11, 17.

But the Brigantes being evidently Ph\u0153nicians, or, at least, a stock of the Ph\u0153nician Iberi, I should think it more pro- bable, that they got the name of Heneti, in after times, from the depravity of their moral conduct, the word eneth, in the Ph\u0153nician language, signi- fying scandalous or depraved.

Another exposition may also be adduced, from the custom of embalming the bodies of their dead, which the Jews, as well as Syrians, had borrowed from the people of Egypt.* In support of this latter exposition we shall state, that henet or hanat, in the Syro-Chaldaic language, signifies to embalm, the ingredients in which process we may, en passant, observe to have been myrrh, aloes, cedar oil, salt, wax, pitch, and rosin, invented with a view to the preservation of their dead, in a state of sweet ness and indecomposition, in their appropriate recep tacles. With this ceremony was the body of our blessed Saviour interred, with aromatic spices, which, Josephus tells us, corresponded with the form of the Jewish sepulture. It is not at all improbable, there fore, that these Ph\u0153nician tribes were called Eneti, * When any of the Egyptians died, the whole family quitted the place of their abode; and during sixty or seventy days, according to the rank or quality of the deceased, abstained from all the comforts of life, excepting such as were necessary to support nature. They embalmed the bodies, and many persons were employed in performing this ceremony. The brains were drawn through the nostrils by an instrument, and the intestines were empt ed by cutting a hole in the abdomen, or belly, with a sharp stone ; after which, the cavities were filled up with perfumes, and the finest odoriforous spices; but the person who made the incision in the body for this purpose, and who was commonly a slave, was obliged to run away im mediately after, or the people present would stone him to death."], [160, "124 that is the embalmers,* from having introduced this custom into Ireland, as they did, also, into Spain. * A question may here naturally be asked, Why do the heathens in the East Indies, in conformity with the practice of the Romans, burn the bodies of the dead ? There have been several conjectures concerning the origin of this barbarous practice, as first, many of the eastern nations adored the fire, and therefore they considered it as an acceptable piece of de votion, to offer up the dead bodies of their relations to it. Secondly, their pride might induce the most celebrated heroes, and the most beautiful women, to desire to conceal from the world, what poor helpless creatures they were while alive. Thirdly, they beheld many indignities offered to the dead, and they were willing, nay desirous that nothing of that nature should happen to their relations. Lastly, they might do it in order to prevent a contagious distemper, which often takes place from the noxious smell of dead bodies. Whether any, or all of these conjectures may be founded in truth, we leave the reader to judge, but, certain it is, the practice itself, is contrary to natural religion, as well as to Divine revelation. Natural religion points out, that as man was formed out of the earth, so at death his body should be consigned to it. \" Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\" Divine revelation teaches us, that as Christ laid down his head in the grave, so the bodies of those who are his faithful followers, should be deposited in the earth ; to rest till that awful period, when he shall come to judge the world in righteousness. Let us pity heathens, who have none of those consolations, which our holy religion holds out to us ; let us daily pray for their con version ; let us not be afraid to lay down our heads in the silent grave ; let us not reflect much on the indignities that may be offered to our bodies after death ; for our Divine Re deemer has gone before us, he has made the grave sweet unto us, and by his almighty power, he will raise us up at the last day. \u2014 Hurd."], [161, "125 Baxter, however, thinks that the Brigantes or Heneti, as they may indifferently be called, having, as we have said, passed over into Thrace, got the name of Bruges, Briges, or Friges, from the cold ness of that climate, and these names got afterwards inflected, according to the several Teutonic and Britannic dialects, into Brigantes, Frixi, Frigones, Frisii, Friscones, Brisones, Britones, and Britanni. Whence he infers, and gives himself credit for the discovery, that the Brigantes of Ireland were the Gauls and the foreigners, who in the older times were denominated the Erii * or Scots ;f and that this was a name common to the Britons, nay, to all the Gauls, before the arrival of the Belg\u00e6 from Germany.

But it being admitted on all hands, as we have said, that the Brigantes were a people of the Ph\u0153ni- cians, who landed in Ireland, from the coast of Gallacia, or France ; they could not possibly have been so named from the cold of that climate, which we all know to be very temperate, not to say warm.

It also means to offer presents to an idol, by which we are to understand the phrase of blessing (brie) an idol, as it occurs in scripture. From brekin, therefore, they being the most superstitious of all the Ph\u0153nicians, they were at first called Breghan, then Bregan or Breogan, whence, afterwards, the Greeks called them Brigantoi, and the Latins, Brigantes, according to the genius of their respective tongues. Nor are there wanting persons who would maintain, that the Spanish Brigantes were called Brigantoi by the Greeks, from the words purges anthos, a florid tower, the name by which the Farus, in Brigantia, in Spain, was formerly designated. But the Spanish Brigantes, they should recollect, were not Greeks, but Ph\u0153nicians. Ptolemy places the Irish Brigantes in the south western quarters of this island, as a kin to those who were distinguished under that name in Britain, living about the sacred promontory, Ieron, just opposite Wales : adjacent to them, on the west, lay the Vodii, and behind those, the Itterni, or Ivernii ; in the west, still behind the promontory of Notium, lay the Vallabori, to whom Drosius joins the Luceni. From these the Nagnat\u00e6, Erdini, and Venicnii, stretched towards the north; but in the extreme northern point of the island lay the Robogdii, by the promontory of this name.

These several people Ptolomy has handed down, as existing in this country ; but we find not the Scots included amongst them, and this has led Cellarius * to suspect, that they were subsequent to those people, at least under this name, in point of occupancy. The opinion of modern f geographers is, that they inhabited the eastern districts, now called Catherlaghensis, Miden sis, and Waterford ; and that from them a part of the district of Media is called, as well in the Irish annals as in some old writings respecting Saint Patrick, Magh-breg, or the plain of the Brigantes, a name it holds to the present day. This our Brigantia then, the modern Waterford, was situated opposite to Brigantia in Spain. In it not only does the river Brigas, now the Barrow, but also the barony of Bargy in the south-west of Ire land, seem to savour strongly of the Brigantine name.

This great pope, seeing the pious inclinations of those people, aud the success of private missionaries amongst them, thought of sending them an apostle invested with full authority, to complete a work so happily begun. The number of histories, which have been composed on the life of St. Patrick, has, in a great measure, tended to darken the know ledge we should have of the truth of what concerns him. According to Usher, and ancient monuments in the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, there were sixty-three or sixty-six.

All which tempests of troubles being over-blowne, there long after arose a new storme, more dreadful then all the former, which over-ran all Spaine, and made an infinite confusion of all things ; that was, the coniming downe of the Gothes, the i 1 nn i us , aud the Vandals : and, lastly, all the nations of Scythia, which, like a mountaine flood, did over-flow all Spaine, and quite drowned and washt away whatsoever reliques there was left of the land-bred people, yea, and of all the Romans too. \u2014 Spenser."], [176, "140 their head, though supported by all the spirit which the consciousness of being general to Alexander the Great, must necessarily have inspired. That the Scythians, having now concluded a treaty with the Romans, proceeded from Spain to Ireland, is the received opinion of the historians of this island. Accordingly we find in an old hymn,* in honour of St. Columba, this expression, \" that the Celtiberian Scythian had nothing equal to Columba.\" They first put in at the south, and took up their residence, finally, towards the north. Baxter f de clares, that their posterity are, at this day, the occupiers of Valentia, and we have the authority of Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus for stating, that, whilst only an Irish colony, they were the confederates of the ancient Saxons, and successful ones they proved, in checking the encroachments of the Roman power. O'Flaherty, conceiving he had discovered the time of the arrival of the Scots from Spain, in an old Irish poemj of the ninth century, ascribes that event to the 3698th year of the Julian period, which ac cording to Scaliger, would be the fifth of the reign * Servatur inBobiens.

But all the memorials of the Scots, says Tigernachus, up to the period of Alexander the Great, are vague and uncertain. Be it so ; yet still I cannot admit \u2014 Baxter's^ assertion to the contrary notwithstanding \u2014 that, before the eighth century, there was no such place known in Britain as Scotia, the name by which Ireland is designated by the venerable Bede, as well as by the monk Ravennas. \" Ireland,\" says Bede, \"is the proper country of the Scots, who, quitting it, added themselves as the third nation to the Picts and Britons in Britannia.

But it was not in Ireland that the Scythians were first distinguished by the name of Scots ; for Saint Jerom* introduces Por phyry, saying, that \" neither did Britain, that fertile province in tyrants, nor the Scotic nations, and all the barbarous provinces round about, know any thing of Moses and the prophets ;\" which makes O'Connor to conclude, that the Scotic nations then lay beyond the pale of the British isle. Nay, Baxter him self affirms, that Scotia was so called by the Romans from the Scoti. Orosius,f a presbyter of Tarracona, who flourished in the beginning of the fifth century, says, that, in his own time, Ireland was inhabited by the nations of the Scoti ;J and St. Isidorus tells us, that \" Ireland and Scotia are the same, being called Scotia, as inhabited by the Scots.\" \" Hence, in aftertimes,\" says Ludovicus Molina, \" arose the * Epist. ad Elesiphontem. f Histor. lib. ii.

These people removed themselves to Ireland from Spain, as Orosius informs us.\" Now, Baxter, inquiring into the etymology of the word Scots,* says, that the Britons, called them Isgwydhwyr, which, in the old scriptural style, is equivalent to Scoituir, or woodland men. The modern name, Guydhal, is the same as Brigantine, or woodland Gaul. For the Irish are, undoubtedly, a mingled race, consisting, as he says, on the one hand, of the Erii or barbarous natives ; on the other hand, of the Scots and Brigantes ; and, thirdly, of the Guydhali or woodland Gauls : and from this he accounts for the circumstance of their being so often designated by the British writers under the compound name of Scoto-Brigantes. Others, again, would look still higher for the origin of the Scythian name, and think it derived from their dexterity in darting the javelin, scutten, in the German language, signifying persons expert * Eginhard, secretary to Charlemagne, or, according to some, his son-in-law, in his annals on the year 812, informs us that the naval forces of the Normans landed in Ireland, the island of the Scots, and having given them battle, in which they were defeated, that those barbarians who escaped, shame fully took flight, and returned to their country. \u2014 MacGeoghegan."], [180, "144 in this art ; just as a portion of the Scythians were called Arimaspi,* that is, who close one eye, or use but one,f which, we all know, is the practice of those who aspire to any eminence in the science of shooting. It strikes me as more likely, not to say indubitable, that the Scythians were so called by the Ph\u0153nicians from the moment of their first incorporation with them, occupying, as they did, a great part of Syria ; and that they did so call them, from the fact of having noticed their roving propensity driving them on as adventurers, through hill, through dale, through desert, and through forest. The word Scythian, then, I would derive from shitin, which, in the Ph\u0153nician language, signifies traversers, wanderers, or rovers, and is itself derived from shit, to go, surround, run about, or digress ; or, from shitah, to expand or dilate, either in allusion to their straggling, or the successful ardor with which they extended their sway, striking terror into their foes by the very name of their princes, and laying low at their feet the most numerous armies. Saca or Sa casene too, a district of Armenia, called after them,' would seem referable to the same source ; sacac, in in that language, signifying to run about or walk, as sacah, does a roof or covering.

And the same sort both of bowes, quivers, and arrowes, are. at \"this day to bee seene commonly amongst the Northerne Irish-Scots, whose Scottish bowes are not past three quarters of a yard long, with a string of wreathed hempe slackely bent, and whose arrowes are not much above halfe an ell long, tipped with steele heads, made like common broad arrow heades, but much more sharpe and slender, that they enter into a man or horse most cruelly, notwithstanding that they are shot forth weakely. \u2014 Spenser.

Sirwalin, therefore, in the Arabic, signified persons who wore this article of dress. From this the Romans, says he, by transposition, gave the name of Silures to those Ph\u0153nicians who had settled in Ireland, as a mark of distinction between them and the rest of their race, just as a part of Gaul, where the use of this article prevails, is called Braccata from that very circumstance \u2014 such is Bochart's opinion. To me, however, it appears more likely that not all the Ph\u0153nicians who had come over to those islands, but only a few of their tribes, the lowest and the poorest, got the denomination of Silures from the rest of their fraternity, and that not from an Arabian term relating to dress, but a Ph\u0153nician one, purporting obscurity and meanness of origin. For zeluth, in the Ph\u0153nician, means vileness or con temptibility, as generally applied to the rabble ; and zaluth, impurities, filthiness. Thus much respecting their condition as a caste. But if you would prefer referring it to the superstition of the whole nation it is evident that in this point of view we may derive 11 Epigr. 22."], [185, "149 Silures from the words zil 'ur, that is worshippers of the sun or fire ; for or, as well as ur, both in the Hebrew and Syriac languages, signify the sun, to blaze, or any luminous body. In this sense we find it in Job,* where he says, \" If I have seen the sun (or) when he shone ;\" and in Nehemiahf \u2014 \" From the morning (or) even unto the mid-day,\" that is * Men have, in all ages, been convinced of the necessity of an intercourse between God and themselves, and the adoration of God supposes him to be attentive to men's desires, and, consistent with his perfections, capable of complying with them. But the distance of the sun and moon is an obstacle to this intercourse. Therefore foolish and inconsiderate men endeavoured to remedy this inconvenience, by laying their hands on their mouths, and then lifting them up to their false gods, in order to testify that they would be glad to unite them selves to them, notwithstanding their being so far separated. We have a striking instance of this in the book of Job, which, properly attended to, will throw a considerable light on ancient Pagan idolatry. Job was a native of the confines of Assyria, and being one of those who believed in the true God, says, in his own vindication, \" If I beheld the sun while it shined, or the moon walking in brightness ; and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand,\" &c. Job xxxi. 26, 27. This was a solemn oath, and the ceremony performed in the following manner : The person who stood before his accusers or before the judge's tribunal, where he was tried, bowed his head and kissed his hand three times, and looking up to the sun, invoked him as an Almighty Being, to take the highest vengeance upon him if he uttered a falsehood. \u2014 Hurd. t viii. 3."], [186, "150 from swwrise till noon ; and from this it was that Apollo was called Orus by the heathens. It also, as I have intimated, signifies fire, lit and blazing, and by synechdoche, the hearth wherein it blazes, in which acceptation it occurs in Isaiah \u2014 \" In the blaze (or) of your fire.\" As to zila, it means to pray to, or worship, as ziluth does prayer, adoration. The introduction into this country of the Ph\u0153nician usage of worshipping the sun and fire, is a point beyond dispute, as we shall make by and bye more manifest. From the Silures is named the island of Silura, separated, by a turbid strait, from the coast, which is inhabited, as Solymus informs us, by a British race, the Dumnonii. There are those who would name as the islands of the Silures, or the Silen\u00e6, what we at this day call the Scilly Isles, and the Belgians the Sorlings ; and which Camden enumer ates to the amount of about one hundred and forty five, more or less, being circularly arranged, and about eight leagues distant from the extreme cape of Cornwall : these have been otherwise called by the ancients Cassiterides, from the tin in which they abounded ; Hesperides, from their western locality ; and Ostrymnid\u00e6, from the promontory of Ostrym nus, in Artabria, to which they are opposite. Now there is no one so unacquainted with history as not to know that the Ph\u0153nicians exported an immense"], [187, "151 quantity of tin from those islands. They alone,* as Strabo informs us, had repaired thither, from Gades, on those commercial speculations, studiously, the while, concealing their schemes from all others ; which Bochart confirms by several collateral testi monies. This tin they used to ship off to Syria and Arabia. And we find in Numbers xxxi. 22, how much it was sought after by the Midianites ; and in Job xix. 24, by the Arabians. Of which see at large in W. Cooke, p. 23 ; Pliny Nat. Hist. vii. 56. Take care, however, that we do not confound these islands with the Cassiteridesf in the Spanish sea, right opposite to Baiona of Tudium, which are supposed, by some, to have been so denominated from the immense rocks with which they are sur rounded, called by the Greek inhabitants of Spain * From some passages in Plutarch, OTIalloran offers a conjecture, that the sacra et delecta cohors of the Carthaginians, mentioned by Diodorus and others, was a select body of Irish troops in the pay of that people. From the time of the Scipios until the reign of Augustus, a space of more than two hundred years, Spain struggled with the Romans for independence ; and we may naturally suppose, that as Ireland was but a few days' sail from Spain, they had auxiliaries from thence, and that the Carthaginians had them also. Hannibal's army was mostly made up of foreign troops, a great part of which he brought from Spain after the taking of Saguntum. \u2014 Mac Gregor. f This name is derived from Kassitera, the Greek for tin ; being the translation of Bara anac, which, in Ph\u0153nician, sig nifies the land of tin ; and from this again the word Britannia would seem to be immediately formed."], [188, "152 Cica, from cicos, which in their language signifies strength, a stronghold, or fortress ; whilst others, with more probability, think it a Ph\u0153nician name given to those islands before ever the Grecians set a foot in Spain, and from the same circumstance as the other islands of the same name were denomi nated, namely, their tin mines, cicar or kicar, in the Syriac, signifying metal of any kind.

Vydhieu, or Guydhieu, means woods at this very day amongst the Britons. Others would interpret Vydhieu as people living in woody places by the water side ; for in Ptolemy we also read of a place called Vodie, which the Irish writers call Dergtenii, or Dergteachneagh, \u2014 and give us to understand it means a woody habitation beside a lake, \u2014 comprising the southern coast of the county Cork, namely, the old baronies of Corcaduibhne, Corcabhaisin, and Corcahuigne.f It may be worth the attention of the learned men of this country to see whether the Vodi\u00e6 were not one of the Ph\u0153nician tribes who had settled here ; for Bohodi in the Ph\u0153nician language meant a con gregated clan ; as you would say, stop with me, live with me ; from whence, in the Arabic, bahad, he stopped, or sojourned, and badi, the origin of a race, the introduction of a family, a congregation. This conjecture is supported by the name of the country called Dergteachneagh, being, as I imagine, an abbreviation from Derc-teachin-agch, which sig nifies travellers, or strangers, in a wilderness ; for derc means he walked, teachin, living or lurking in a lonely place, and agah, he passed the night.

The Lucanii, or Luceni, are to be found also in Ptolemy as an ancient people in this island, of whom Orosius also makes mention. Richard Cirencester says, that their settlement lay in the county Kerry, near the bay of Dingle.* The name is supposed to be compounded of the two Irish words lugh-aneigh, meaning the inhabitants of a district adjoining a lake, or sea, what you would call, says Baxter, mari gene, or sea-born.

The name of Lugadii to the natives was equivalent with sliocht lugach macithy, that is, a maritime race of dwellers by the water. Yet, sliocht, may perhaps be of Ph\u0153nician root, coming from shlic, a neighbour ; in this sense, too, we shall find ourselves at home, for slioght, in Irish,* signifies alliance or kindred. But Baxter, descanting upon the origin of the word Lacanii, or Luceni, says, aug, by the old Britons, was understood for the liquor of water, and thus for the sea, whilst geni, or eni, meant descent, * It is well known that in Munster and Connanght, in the western parts of Ulster, and the south of Leinster, this ancient dialect is spoken most extensively; and although many of the native Irish are sufficiently acquainted with the English tongue to use it for the purpose of daily traffic, and mere busi ness, yet it is in their beloved Celtic that they think, through that they feel, and by that they communicate to each other the deep purposes of present revenge, and future triumph. It is no random assertion, but an authenticated fact, that among the most abject poor, who cut turf on the bogs, or break stones for the roads of those districts, the proudest legends of their country's former glory, and the prowess of her native chiefs, couched in language the most exciting that can be conceived, are frequently repeated ; together with the wild prophetic rhymes of gifted bards, handed down orally from father to child, predicting the re-appearance of that sun which they con ceive to have set beneath the dark night of English usurpation.

Hence he infers that the Saxon pirates were called by the Britons Lhoegyr, corruptly for Luguir, or seamen, and from this, he says, comes the modern name of Anglia or England ; lhuch, in Britain, signifying at this day a lake, as loch does in Ireland. If one may indulge conjecture in a matter not very clear, I should think myself near the true ex traction of this name by deriving it from lucus, a grove, which we know those were in the habit of resorting to, nay, of worshipping. In this case we may seek for the origin of slioght in the Ph\u0153nician slocah, or sliocah, which signifies divinity. But this I do not like, for the people called Luceni, or Lu canii, existed before the time of the Romans, which would make it incongruous to take as a parallel in stance the name of the Spanish city, Lucus, now Lugo, in the country of the Gallaici, which must be acknowledged to be designated from those religious haunts. Therefore, as well as Lucene, the name of a Ph\u0153nician town in B\u0153tia, I should suppose it comes from lushen, or leshen, a word of very various significations, all of which, however, spontaneously apply to this people. First it is a people or nation ; secondly a difference of language or dialect, which we know to prevail amongst the several tribes of Syria. The Ephrat\u00e6i, for instance, could not arti culate the double letter, sh, instead of which they would pronounce it in its single form, s, which may"], [193, "157 have proceeded either from the air or local influence. Thus we find that when, in Judges xii. they were obliged to say shibboleth, a river, they could only call it sibboleth. The B\u0153tians of my country, also, pronounce z instead of s, calling it zabana instead of sabana. The Gallacians, too, differ from the other provinces of Spain, not in pronunciation alone, but in many other peculiarities of language. The same may be observed by every one in the idiom of his native country. But to return. It means, in the third place, a flame of fire, which would seem at once to point us to the practice of their worshipping this element in their sacred groves, a practice, I may add, which the Chald\u00e6ans, the Persians, the Medes, and other nations of Asia, shared in common with the Ph\u0153nicians, who offered sacrifice to fire after the custom of the Persians,* at first only worshipping it * When the Persians drew near to their consecrated fires in their divine service, they always approached them from the west side, because by that means their faces being turned to those as well as the rising sun, they could direct their worship towards both at the same time. The priests are obliged to watch day and night to maintain and repair the con secrated fire. But it is absolutely necessary that it be re kindled after the purest manner that can possibly be devised; for which purpose they frequently make use of a steel and flint, or two hard sticks, which, by continual friction, will in time take fire. Sometimes, likewise, they kindle it by the light ning which darts down from heaven on any combustible matter ; and sometimes again by those ignes fatui which fre quently arise in marshy grounds; or else by common fire, in"], [194, "158 as a type or symbol of the Deity, but so, however, that gradually, and at last, this commemoration, and, as such, innocent adoration, degenerated and sunk into actual and downright worship of the element itself.* This superstition they imported into Ireland, as they did into Spain, and their other colonies. But as this people had established their settle ment in the country by the promontory of Notium, I should not think it at all unlikely that they derived their name from that very fact, for lushen, or leshen, in the Syriac, is a cape, or oblong and mountainous tongue of land jutting out into the sea. The name of the Lugadii would seem to be equi valent with that of allies, for luahin, in the Ph\u0153ni cian, implies association or union. Or they might have got this name from luch, or lach, meaning sturdy youths, valiant warriors, in conformity with lucadin, the stormers of towns ; whence evidently is derived laochd, the Irish designation for an armed soldiery, as well as lugh, active, and luch, a captive in battle. We find, besides, that laga, which signi fies renown, or pre-eminent distinction, was an usual adjunct to the names of many of the leading families case it is pure and undefiled, or with such as the Banians make use of to kindle the funeral piles. But they have one other method still, as noble as it is pure ; and that is, by collecting the rays of the sun into the focus of a burning-glass.\u2014 Hurd. * Theodoret. Hist. Eccl. V. 38. S. Isidor.

Nor would the conjecture be altogether without ground if, after all our peregrination and excursive research for the origin of the name of this people, we would at last turn home, and look for it in the Irish word lughadh, meaning the interposition of an oath,* and which would indicate their compactness as a social body ; or in lughad, scantiness, as if they were but few ; or, finally, in luchd, a tribe or assemblage. * According to the annals of Ulster, cited by Ware, the usual oath of Laogare II., King of Ireland, in the time of St. Patrick, was by the sun and wind.

Others think it a degenerated term, from Ull-an teigh, which they explain by the inhabitants of the county of Ull. But teigh, in Irish, means a house or shelter. Ull is, indeed, a district in this island, mentioned by Ptolemy, and called by the Irish"], [197, "161 writers who have touched upon this point, Ullagh, and also Ullad. This word some would derive from Thuat-all-adh, a northern section of the county of Ull, which formerly was the modern province of Ulster, but was afterwards circumscribed to the single county of Down. Our old poems and chro nicles call the inhabitants of this tract, Tuath de Donans,and understand thereby the northern people,* of intrepid bravery ; for tuath, in Irish, means not only a people, but the north: and dan, brave, intrepid. To my mind Boluntii is a name of Ph\u0153nician ex traction, derived very probably from the quality of the ground ; in that language, bolun means a glebe or gleby land, as it does, also, fruit and the shoots of palm trees : or, with still more appearance of probability, we may derive it from the superstitious worship of that nation, bolinthis or belinthis meaning the immolation of he-goats to the idols of Baal, and bolintir, his augurs or soothsayers. Akin to this is the gentile Spanish name of Bolontii or Bolonii, in habitants of the old city of Bolona, built by the Ph\u0153nicians in the straits of Gibraltar, by the pillars of Hercules. But Ull, too, savors very strongly of the Ph\u0153nician tongue, in which it literally signifies fortitude, whence el, brave, powerful, and also an idol in Vid. Collect, de Reb.

I should prefer, however, to consider them a haughty, arrogant and overbearing tribe of the Ph\u0153nicians, who obtained this name from erdin or eradin, which signifies, Hectors, from rod, he domi neered or bore haughty sway. This nation appears formerly to have inhabited several districts of Spain, which to this day retain their vestiges; for instance, Ardines and Ardon, amongst the Astures; Ardanue, Ardanui, and Ardan\u00e6, in Celtiberi\u00e6 ; Ardanaz, in Cantabria, and Ardon and Ardona, in Gallacia. From thence, too, it is very probable, that the town of Ardinan, at the mouth of the river Ban, in the province of Ulster, whither they had first introduced their colonies, hath derived its name, as well as Ardicnice, a village of the same : Ardoyne, a little town in the county Wicklow, and Erinach, another town in Ulster, celebrated from its spring well, de dicated to St. Fionan ; beside which was erected in the beginning of the twelfth century, a monastery, called by the old name of Carrig, from the immense cliff adjacent ; for carraic, in Irish, is a rock, from"], [202, "166 the Ph\u0153nician carric, fortified. Perhaps to the same origin belongs Artane, the name of a very delightful village in Leinster, although it might have been derived from Araa-tanar, stony or flinty ground, corresponding with the Irish arteine or ar tine, of the same signification. Conterminous with the Erdinii were the Venicnii or Benicnii, ancient residents of Ireland, noticed also by Ptolemy, situated by the promontory of Venicnium, on the western coast of the county Donegal, the Ergal of the ancients. Some imagine that they were so called from this same promontory alluded to in the last chapter, which Camden thinks equivalent with the English words, ram's head ; Venictium being, by the authority of Baxter, dege nerated from Vendne-cniu, which, in the old dialect of the Brigantes, indicates the head of a young ram ; cniu, to a British ear, conveying the idea of the young of almost every animal, in the plural number. It strikes me, however, as more like the truth, that they did not take their name from the promon tory, but that the promontory, on the contrary, was denominated from them ; as that which we now call Cape Finisterre, on the Cantabrian coast, was called Scythic and Celtic, from those respective nations ; and that which the Arabians in after times called Taraf-al-garr, signifying a perilous extremity or point, the modern Trafalgar, lying on the maritime"], [203, "167 coast of B\u0153tica, between Calpe and the straits of Gibraltar, was called by the Greeks the promontory of Juno, their favorite deity ; and as the modern Cabo de Gata was called by the Ph\u0153nician settlers upon the Mediterranean coast of Spain, the Cape of Gora ; for gor, in the Syriac, intimates a stranger or foreigner taking up his abode in another place than where he was born, a sojourner ; whence the Greek georos, a neighbour, a tiller. As to the people themselves, whether Venicnii or or Benicnii, they appear to me to have been a tribe of the Ph\u0153nicians, and to have got this name from Kini, which imports, of a Cinn\u00e6an stock, or from the land of Canaan : benikini consequently implying a tribe from such a stock. Nor is it at all unlikely but that there might have been an additional motive for this name, suggested by the frankness of those people's demeanor and the purity of their moral character,* for, in this language, beni-enin means * Such appear to be the general principles and outlines of the popular faith, not only among the Greeks, but among all other primitive nations, not favored by the lights of Revela tion : for though the superiority and subsequent universality of the Greek language, and the more exalted genius and refined taste of the early Greek poets, have preserved the knowledge of their sacred mythology more entire ; we find traces of the same simple principles and fanciful superstructures from the shores of the Baltic to the banks of the Ganges : and there can be little doubt that the voluminous poetical cosmogonies still extant among the Hindoos, and the fragments preserved of"], [204, "168 upright and righteous dwellers, whether of town or country, from kian or kina, just and true, in which sense we meet it in the Syriac version of the gospel according to St. Matthew : \u2014 and Joseph, her hus band, was (kina) a just man, As to beni, it is a term applied not only to sons, but to the residents of any particular place, which by a very natural association may be considered as their mother, being there born or educated. Thus in Ezekiel, xvi. 28, the people of Assyria are called beni, or the sons, of Assur ; and in Jeremiah, ii. 1 0, the Memphians are called Veni, or the sons, of Noph. The word is, also, referred to the condition or morals of the persons alluded to, as in the third chapter of the Acts, and 25th verse, the Israelites with whom God had con cluded a covenant by the form of circumcision, are styled the sons of the prophets and of the testament, and in other passages throughout the sacred volume and elsewhere, the wicked are designated as the sons those of the Scandinavians, may afford us very competent ideas of the style and subjects of those ponderous compilations in verse, which constituted the mystic lore of the ancient priests of Persia, Germany, Spain, Gaul, and Britain; and which in the two latter countries were so extensive, that the education of a druid sometimes required twenty years.

In many cases God has shewn himself to be at the head of divine providence, but not in all ; to convince men, that how ever hardened they may be in wickedness while in this world, yet there may be a time, or a period, when the mask of hypocrisy will be laid aside ; nay, it will be stripped off, and the daring sinner will stand as a culprit at the bar of infinite justice. On the other hand, the oppressed virtuous man should rest satisfied in this, that God will be his friend at the last day, notwithstanding all the sufferings he may have been subjected to in this world ; for it is an established maxim both in natural and revealed religion, that the upright judge of the universe, will not deceive his creatures. \u2014 Hurd."], [206, "170 CHAP.

We find, too, that the ancient Spaniards could boast of their Caucii, in the district of the Vaccei, whose princi pal city was Cauca, placed by Antoninus as sixteen days' journey, or on the sixteenth station on the road from Emerita to C\u00e6sar Augusta. Some suppose that they had obtained this name from their extraordinary stature ; for cauc in the old British, and coc in the Brigantine, and hauch, or hoch, in the German, all imply one and the same thing, namely, lofty, or high. Hence, Baxter con jectures, had been borrowed the inscription found amongst the ancient Cumbri, the Ceangi of the Brigantes, \" To the god Cocis,\" which is supposed to have been executed in fulfilment of a vow to the genius of the river, at this day called Coque in the country of the Otonid\u00e6. But is it not possible that those Caucii may have been Celts,* cau,in their language, signifying a river ? This, however, I do not like, as I think it more likely that they were one of the tribes of the Ph\u0153 nicians who had landed in Ireland from Spain; whose name, like that of the Spanish city Cauca, I conceive borrowed from the temperature of the * The name of geilt, ceilt, or keilt, which signifies terror, a wild man or woman, a sylvestrous person ; and hence I think the name, Celt.\u2014 Vallancey,"], [208, "172 climate in which they had fixed themselves.

They further state that they had taken up their settlement between the mountains and the sea, in that part of the country now called Coulan, Cuolan, or Crioch Cuolan, which means, says Seward, a close and con fined tract, or as others prefer a corn country. Many persons derive the name of those people from the old British words, Mene-ui-pou, a narrow region, with which Coulan above mentioned almost corresponds. Others think that they took their name from the city of Manapia, which they say is com pounded of the British words, Mant-ab, signifying the mouth of the water. Regio senibus apta."], [209, "173 But to my ear their name sounds the certainty of their Ph\u0153nician descent. I had formerly supposed that it had been derived from Mana-pip, a double portion or part of some tribe or nation ; but as the Syrians had a custom of denominating themselves and their people from their idols, and their super stitious worship of them, I am more disposed now to think they were so called from Mani-apiin, which means, adorning with branches or flowers a multi tude of idols, or singly, that of Mercury, which Mani also signifies, and whom the Ph\u0153nicians wor shipped as the god of calculation. That this custom prevailed also amongst the ancient Greeks and Ro mans, we have numerous proofs in the geographi cal names of Spain. Thus, from Afrodite, the Greek name for Venus, and Afrodisios, which means belonging to Venus, Tim\u0153us and Silenus have given the name of Afrodisia to the ancient city of Gades in B\u0153tica, which was contiguous to the site of the present city of Cadiz.

From Artemis, Diana, the Greeks gave the name of Arte misian, or the temple of Diana, to that city of the Contestani which the Romans afterwards, and from the same cause, adapted to their own language as Dianium; and which now, from that decay to which names as well as things must submit, is called Denia. The Monapia of Pliny, called Menavia by Orosius, seems to me to have been inhabited by the people called Manapii : I mean that island in the Irish sea almost midway between England and Ireland, of an oblong form, extending from north to south \u2014 it is called by Ptolemy, Mon\u00e6oida. This and another island lying more to the south, and wider in its dimensions, situated in the bay of the Ordovices, from whom it is separated only by a narrow strait, are both designated by the common appellation of Mon\u0153. The more southern one abounded in a hardy popu lation, which it hesitated not to strengthen by open ing an asylum to all deserters, without regard to the cause. After its capture by the Angli, it got from them the name of Anglesey, that is, the isle of the Angli, or English. Mona is a term of Ph\u0153nician superstition, from mon, an idol or image. Moneoida would seem compounded of mon, and of oid, a festival, intimating a festival held in honor of an idol ; and Monoceda of mon, and chedad, which signifies bent or stooping, the attitude of reverence in the presence of their idols. Evolenum, which is"], [211, "175 supposed to have been the city of Menapia, I would derive from hebelin, idols ; and Coulan from coulin, sounds, thunders ; elsewhere called Beth-col,* that is, * A divination called the Bath-col, which was the taking as a prediction the first words they heard any body pronounce ; and as superstitions have ever been contagious, we find some thing similar to this in the Grecian records; for when Socrates was in prison, a person there happened to quote from Homer the following line : \u2014 \" In three days, I, Phthi\u00e6, shall visit thy shores.\" Socrates immediately said to \u00c6schinus \u2014 \" From this I learn I shall die in three days !\" [He formed this opinion from the double sense of the word \" Phthi\u00e6,\" it being in Greek not only the name of a place, but also signifies death.] Conformably to this prediction, Socrates was put to death three days after.\" All these various modes have descended to our times. The first Christians, in adopting them, rejected searching into pro fane writers, and looked for these, as they termed them, divine ordinances, in the Scripture. They termed them the \"sortes sanctorum,\" and even attempted to justify the practice from the authority of Proverbs, chap. xii. verse 33 \u2014 \" The lot is cast into the lap, but the disposing thereof is of the Lord ;\" and again, of this text \u2014 \" Search, and ye shall find ;\" but at the same time, they omitted to pay due attention to such verses as these \" Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God ;\" and (Deut. chap, xxiii. verse 10,j \" There shall not be found among you any that useth divination, &c, for all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord ;\" and their sentence (according to Leviticus, chap. xx. verse 27,) was to be stoned to death. When Ileraclius in his war against Cosroes, wished to learn in what place he should take up his winter quarters, he purified his army for three days, opened the Gospels, and found \" Albania ?\" A thousand other instances might be given to prove its prevalency ; and many learned divines have seriously argued in its favour, iii many grave and ponderous folio"], [212, "176 the daughter of voice, intimating not a real or solid voice, but the echo thereof, more particularly the volumes! !

The Virgilian Lots, in the mean time, did not languish, though the \"holy\" ones so much flourished ; there were still found many admirers ef the Classics, who preferred consulting Virgil to Scripture, not the less so, perhaps, from the then generally received opinion, of Virgil's having been a great conjurer. In the reign of Charles the First, when implicit credence was placed in lots, anagrams, &c, we meet with several accounts of this divination having been had recourse to. Howell, in his entertaining Letters, frequently mentions it; and Cowley, writing of the Scotch Treaty, makes use of the following curious words : \u2014 \" The Scotch will moderate something of the rigour of their demands ; the mutual necessity of an accord is vissible ; the King is persuaded of it, and to tell you the truth, (which I take to be an argument above all the rest,) Virgil has told the same thing to that purpose.\" Charles the First himself and Lord Falkland being in the Bodleian Library, were shewn a magnificently bound Virgil, and the latter, to amuse the King, proposed that they should try to discover in the \" Virgilian Lots \" their future fortunes. They did so, and met with passages equally ominous to each. Nor has this superstition been confined to Europe, or the borders of the Mediterranean ; it is equally to be met with in Arabia and Persia, for Credula mens hominis, et erect\u0153 fabulis aures.\" \" The mind of man is every where equally credulous, and the ears equally open in all parts of the world to receive fables.\" Superstitious practices are therefore never lost, but,"], [213, "177 representation of the reverberated voice in the oracles. where the slightest intercourse exists, the first thing bartered for are these.

When Hafiz himself died, several of the Ulemas violently objected to granting him the usual rites of sepulture, on account of the licentiousness of his poetry ; but at length, after much dispute, it was agreed that the matter should be decided by the words of Hafiz himself. For this purpose, his diruan (or collection of poems) was brought, and being opened at random, the first that presented itself was read ; it proved to be the following : \u2014 Turn not thy steps from Hafiz mournful grave, Him plunged in sin shall heavenly mercy save ! Of course every funereal honour was immediately ordered to be paid him ; he was buried at the favourite mosella, and a mag nificent tomb was raised over his almost adored remains, shadowed, as Captain Franklin tells us, by the poet's beloved cypresses ; in this a remarkable tine copy of his Odes was continually placed. When the great Nadir Shah and his officers were passing by this tomb, near Shiraz, they were shewn the copy of the poet's works, and one of the company opening it, the first passage that met their eyes was the follow ing, which they, of course, immediately applied to the con queror : \u2014 \" It is but just that thou shouldst receive a tribute from all fair youths, since thou art the sovereign of all the beauties in the universe; thy two piercing eyes have thrown Khater (Scythia) and Khaten (Tartary) into confusion ; India and China pay homage to thy curled locks; thy graceful mouth gave the streams of life to Kheyr ; thy sugared lip ren ders the sweet reeds of Mirr (Egypt).contemptible.\" X"], [214, "178 CHAP.

Ptolemy, in alluding to them, calls them at one time, Auteiroi, at another, Auteroi, and places them in certain parts of the country then known by the name of Naquatia or Connatia. Others think they inhabited those districts which correspond with the present counties of Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon in the province of Connaught, being that old and extensive tract often called Muriah or Hy-Moruisge, which they interpret by the region of sea water, and which is still preserved without much"], [215, "179 alteration in Morisk, the name of a barony as well a sa little town in the county Mayo,* and in Murrach a village of the barony of Carbery in the county of Cork.

Baxters is of opinion that the Auteri were so called by the Brygantes after they and the Belg\u00e6 had taken possession of the greater part of Ireland to their colonies, \u2014 that they were the Erigen\u00e6 or real offspring of the Irish soil \u2014 and that they were driven at first by the Brigantes from Britain, who after wards, in this country, followed up their pursuit till they made them take shelter in its remotest extre mity.

O'Flaherty* differs from this opinion, and asserts that the name of Auteri was forcibly twisted out of the term ath-en-ria or ath-na-rig, that is, the king's ford. But Ptolemy having declared his belief that Autera, an ancient city in Ireland, was the capital of the Auteri residing therein, many have been thereby induced to interpret the word as meaning a village or state by the waters of the west, compounded, as it were, of the Celtic aubh or aith, water, and eireigh, a western people. For the Auteri had inhabited near the sea coast. I, however, would venture to guess that the Au teri, or ancient Irish, were the primitive Ph\u0153nicians who had discovered this island, and that they had obtained or assumed this name from that spirit of enterprising research which, in this as in other in stances, had been so signally rewarded.

Or what if they chose this name from autereh, or aature, a crown ? This, we know, was an epithet given of old to Tyre, the capital of Ph\u0153nicia, as in Isaiah xxiii. 8, it is said, \" Tyre formerly crowned,\" as it may well be called from the splendor of its buildings, the strength of its citadels and fortifications, and abundance of its riches, \" whose merchants were princes, and whose factors were the renowned of the earth.\" With the Hebrews and Syrians also, autereh, or crown, was equivalent with honor or delight. We meet fre quently in the scriptures \" the crown of old men\" for their children's children ; \" the crown of glory in the hand of the Lord,\" &c. which perhaps gave rise to the custom amongst some ancient states to wear a crown on either their head, their neck, or their right hand.

Daunii, Dunin, &c. coming from which, sig nify the country of lakes or rivers. In this sense it corresponds to the Irish denomination of a tract or portions of a country, Magh Gennuisg.

In the Celtic Ian-"], [222, "186 guage, dun is precisely the same thing as berga, the common name for a place of abode, and the Teutonic berg, meaning a fortress upon a hill, or a hill sur rounded by a fortress. These have been borrowed from the Arabic and old Ph\u0153nician in which we meet with the word barg, a tower, and barga, a villa. Hence was derived Barca, the name of a town amongst the Vetones in Spain ; Barceo, another amongst the Vaccei; Barch, amongst the Edetani ; Bargos, amongst the Carpetani ; Bargo, Bargota , Barjas, Bergua, Berga, Berge, Begos, Borge, Bur gas, and other names of this kind to be met with in almost every canton of that Peninsula. In this list I should not have omitted Bergio, an ancient fortified town of the Lacetani, designated by Livy by the denomination of \" the long town,\" which it afterwards changed for that of Celsona ; its modern name is Solsona. I should myself suppose that the Irish Damnii were a tribe of Spanish Ph\u0153nicians, descended from the Damnii, or Damniani, who built the ancient city of the Edetani, called Damiana, the name by which Ptolemy also notices it. And, though some Spanish writers would derive the term from the Celtic words da-min, a habitation beside a mountain or river, it strikes me as more probable that it originated from its Ph\u0153nician inhabitants, and in allusion to the worship which they paid their idols, damain, or damon, signifying in their language, idols or images."], [223, "187 Or, perhaps, the name belongs to geography, and comes from dumain, the descendants of Dumah, a city of Syria, or Dimona which was one of the lot of Judah, or from a city of Arabia of the same name, and called after Dumah, the son of Ismael, of which latter it is said in Isaiah, \" the burden of Dumah,\" rendered by the septuagint Idumea ; and the Ph\u0153 nicians, we may observe, never forgot the Arabian cities from whence they had emigrated into Syria. To the same source would I refer the name of the Damnonii, or Damhnonii, who according to the ancient* writers upon Irish topics, originally occupied the lands of Cornwall and Devonshire, laying to wards the extreme west of England, just opposite our shores ; they subsequently took possession of the ancient Hy-Moruisge, or Morisk, an extensive district in the west of Ireland, being the present county of Mayo, in the province of Connaught. Others, on the contrary, think this name derived from the Celtic, or Cambrico-Britannic word, Dyvneint or Duvnon, meaning depth of water, Duvnonii, * For their dear sakes I love thee, Ma vourneen, though unseen ; Bright be the sky above thee, Thy shamrock ever green ; May evil ne'er distress thee, Nor darken nor defile, But heaven for ever bless thee \u2014 My own green isle !

The Coriondi or Curiondi, a tribe of the Irish Brigantes, were celebrated sailors and lived almost continually and professionally upon the water. Ptolemy, in his writings, has made mention of them, and it is generally admitted that their settlements lay in the present county of Wexford, in the province of Leinster.

Certain families, of their party, we find had separated from the general corps, and established themselves in the adjoining county of Carlow, in a place then called Hy-Cabha-nagh, being a district of the barony of Idrone. The opinion most received is, that the name of Coriondi consists of the Irish words corcach, vessels, and ondiu, a wave. In this light it may fairly be rendered as equivalent with, navigators. The ancient Irish used besides to call them Corthagh, that is \" the rowers,\" and their habitation or locality Hy-Moragh, that is, the maritime country. Some, however, on the authority of Camden, would take another road, though aiming at the same sense, and maintain that they were inhabitants of Corcagia or Cork, and the founders of that city, in Irish Corcugh, being the capital of all Munster, and next to Dublin the most considerable city in the kingdom, for extent, for commerce, and its concomitant wealth. Seeing then that the barky vessels or canoes of the ancient Bri tons were called curuc\u00e6,* they think it very probable that the town of Cork was so called, as you would say \" the dockyard,\" or naval store, and its inhabi tants, coriondi, that is, navigators, from those curuc\u00e6 or bark boats.

Others account for the composition of Nagnat\u00e6, by the Irish words, Na-gae-taegh, meaning an abode near the sea, and affirm that our ancient historians had called them, Slioght gae, that is, a race or pro geny settled beside the sea ; from which latter words combined, comes the modern name of Sligo I should rather think, however, that the name of this people was Ph\u0153nician, and borrowed from that of the chief or leader of their body ; for in that language I perceive, that nagud, means a prince or chieftain, to whom the people look up, and to whose decision they appeal in all matters of dispute or litigation ; this word in the plural, makes nagudin. Nor would it be straining our fancy at all too far, if we would suppose them to have been so designated"], [237, "201 from the quality of our lovely isle, which threw open to the delighted vision of those bold ad venturers\u2014at the moment, perhaps, when long estrangement from home and country was whisper ing despair\u2014 the genial richness of its prolific bosom * In support of this conjecture I would observe, that nagad, means a spacious country, a generous soil; nagab-natah, means the same, with the additional consideration of aridity or dryness ; which comports well with the nature of the western districts, in which those people had taken up their residence. Nacha-natah, means the inhabitants of a country such as we have just described. Nor do I agree with Baxter in his etymology of the islands of Arran or Aran, as they appear to me to have been so named by the Ph\u0153nicians, as a great many of the Irish mountains have been, from their abounding in trees, which they call Aran,f and to * Nee absonum est sic appellatos k regionis alien\u00e6 qualitate, qu\u00e6 eis novas sedes obtulit. + It has also, in a peculiar degree, the property of preserv ing bodies committed to the grave.

Unless you would choose to adhere to the exposition of the Spaniards \u2014 known, as we must admit they are, for accuracy in such points \u2014 who think that the name of the valley of Aran, which lies in the county of Urgellum, and under the jurisdiction formerly of the Ilergetes, being watered with rivers and numberless fountains, had been given it by the Ph\u0153nicians from its simi litude to Mesopotamia, which they called Haran. The valley of Arana, which belongs to the Canta brians, is submitted to the same test of the reader's decision, as are also various other tracts in the Spanish peninsula of like name, such as Aranaz, Aranache, Aranda, Aranga. The promontory of Robogh is supposed to have given its name to the Robogdi, who were an ancient people in this island, inhabiting parts of the several counties of Antrim, Londonderry, and Tyrone, in the province of Ulster. Ptolemy represents them as facing the Voluntioi. Camden thinks Robogd to be synonymous with Fair-fore-land, being a shewy and imposing cape ; * for in the old dialects of the Bri gantes, re, ri, and ro, are indifferently used for rae, or ragh, before ; and vog-diu means a wave, so that * On the water it forms one of those ever varying and pecu liar novelties of view, which in this northern region give sin gular pleasure."], [239, "203 Robogd, in his estimation, would express this local position, before the waves of the sea. But, as I take it, the promontory was named after the people living beside it, not the people after the promontory ; from the Ph\u0153nician words rabh-gad, a multiplicity of associates : or rob-gad, tumultuous allies, plun derers, invaders. The Heremonii or Hermonii, who were classified according to their respective tribes of the Falgii, the Elii, the Caelenii, and the Morii, were inha bitants of the eastern and central division, comprising the whole of the present province of Leinster. The fabulous story is, that they were the descendants of Heremon, who was the son of Milesius, from Spain. There is also another vulgar belief, that they were so denominated from residing in the west, the very \u2022name, it is supposed, signifying a western tract. But if it be at all of Irish extraction, it were better to derive it from armuinn, exiles ; but even this, I do not approve of. I shall, therefore, deduce the appellation from the Ph\u0153nician ermin, naked, un clothed ; or ermon, a chesnut-tree, in which the hills of that district abounded. But what if I should assert that they were Ph\u0153ni cians, from the vicinity of mount Hermon, which projects over Pameas ? For this celebrated mountain of Syria was so high, and so cold, that it was capped with snow in the midst of summer; which made the natives take flight from its cheerless horrors, and"], [240, "204 repair to the more attractive and congenial air of Tyre. Or from Hermonin, a small mountain be tween Tabor and Hermon, at the other side of the Jordan ? whose inhabitants, also, are called by geographers, Hermonii, or Hermonit\u00e6. But if we may indulge conjecture, I would add, that the Irish Heremonii may have been so called as being essentially a tribe of the Ph\u0153nicians. For the Syrians were called Aram\u00e6i or Aremin, from Aram, a region of Asia Minor, whose maritime in- habitants, were Ph\u0153nicians, and their principal cities, Tyre and Sidon. Now this region obtained its name, not from Aram, the son of Camuel, of the family of Nachor, (mentioned in Genesis, xxii. 21, 23.) ; but from Aram, the fifth son of Sem, with whom the inhabitants of that coast ever plumed themselves as being connected. Accordingly, we know that Shur \u2014 that is \u2014 minus a syllable \u2014 Ashur, or Assyria, and Syria itself, which was confounded therewith \u2014 was called by them by the name of Aram. Hence, too, the Syrians living on the con- tinent of the land of Canaan, and the Ph\u0153nicians bordering on the sea coast, would fain affect the distinctive designation of Arameans. The Greeks used to call them Syrians, but they used to call themselves Aram\u00e6ans, as affirmed by Josephus and Strabo.

Nay, the Syriac language itself, was called Arimith, from this very source, as in Esdras, iv. 7, and in II. Kings, xviii. 26, where it is said, \" We pray thee that thou speak to us, thy servants, (arimith,) in the Syriac tongue, and not speak to us, (ihudaith,) in the Jewish.\" Ireland seems still to retain some vestiges of this people in the name of Armoy, a small town in the county Antrim ; in that of Annan or Ardman, a village in the barony of Ballaghkeen, in the county Wexford.

That the Heremonii were Aremin or Syrians, you will be more apt to admit, if you but observe that the names of the tribes into which they were dis tributed are Ph\u0153nician.

The Egyptians likewise used it, as yee may read in Herodotus, and may be gathered by the description of Berenice, in the Greeke Commentary upon Callimachus. The Greekes also used it aunciently, as appeareth by Venus mantle lyned with starrs, though afterwards they changed the form thereof into their cloakes, called Pallia, as some of the Irish also use.

Some suppose that they had been established amongst us before the time of the second importation of the Belg\u00e6, and that they consisted of Punic or Iberic merchants, who had frequently and from immemorial time visited the coasts : they would, therefore, in accordance with this view, interpret the word as seafarers, or mariners, from its similitude to the Irish fomhor, or fomhorac, a pirate. But to my mind it is differently composed, and comes from the Ph\u0153nician expressions, fom-or, implying a foot shaking the earth before fire,* as much as to say, * These consecrated fires are at present much in vogue amongst the Gaures, and preserved with so much care and precaution, that they are called idolaters, and the worshippers of fire, though without the least grounds to support the un generous accusation. For they pay no adoration to the material fire, although they make use of that element in the celebration of their divine service. It is the deity alone whom they adore in the presence of the fire, as the true symbol of the Divine Majesty. Though fire, according to the Gaures, is the purest of all the elements, yet they look upon it only as one of God's most perfect creatures, and it is, as they imagine, his favourite habitation. When they pray, they neither make their addresses to Mithra, nor the sun, nor the fire, but God alone ; many in stances whereof are produced by the learned Dr. Hide from whence we may very readily infer, that the imputations of idolatry are as rash and groundless in Asia as they are in Europe."], [245, "209 dancers in honor, and revellers in honor, of this element ; for we have it on historical faith, that the sacrificial feasts of the Ph\u0153nicians, and of all nations also, terminated generally in drunkenness, with las civious dances and plays.

This is the origin of Formariz, the name of a town in Spain, amongst the Zamorenses ; and of Formiche, the name of two small towns amongst the Celtiberians. Perhaps, too, we may recognize a vestige of those people in the name of Fermoy, a very handsome town in the county Cork, which some think to be an abbreviation for Fear magh, or Fear-magh-feine, a man living in a sacred level.

They were distinguished into three nations, Firbolg\u00e6, Firdomnan, and Fir galion, which are generally interpreted, clan Bolus, clan Domnan, and clan Galion : of the two last we shall speak under the head of the Domnanii and Galionii. On the origin of the name Bolg\u00e6 the learned are far from agreeing in their opinions. Some think that by clan Bolus are meant the Belg\u00e6 of Britain, who having passed over from Belgium, or the lower Germany, spread themselves over the counties of Somerset, Wilton, and the interior of Haverford ; and that the British language which they made use of in Ireland, was eloquently and expressively desig nated Belgaid, intimating it to be a Belgic idiom. governor of Leinster, was the chief of the pentarchy, and monarch of the whole island.

The old Irish name for year, was Beal-aine, now Bliadhain, meaning, liter ally, the circle of Beal, that is the period of the sun's annual revolution ; all which terms they bor rowed from the rites and religious ordinances of the Ph\u0153nicians.

The people called Miledh, and so frequently alluded to in the ancient poetry of Ireland, are sup posed by the more modern antiquarians to have be longed to the Milesians. These latter again, it is believed, were the posterity of the Carthagenians, who sailed from Spain, under the conduct, say they, of Heber* and Heremon, the two sons of Milesius, the * Heber, after this first advantage, having refreshed his troops, advanced into the country to make further discoveries, in hopes of meeting some of the colony, that were scattered by the storm some time before, and after a long and fatiguing march, arrived at Invear-Colpa, where he found Heremon with"], [251, "215 king of Spain, and settled in Ireland with a host of followers. In the poetical histories of the Druids, we have it upon record that this island was inhabited by the Miledh Slioght Fene,and the Miledh Esp line ; which first names have been interpreted to us by later times, as equivalent to Milesius the Ph\u0153nician. The learned of our day, however, think that Miledh is a perverted abbreviation from M Bealedh, meaning the worshippers of Beal, and figuratively, the noble Druids, Fene, too, they say, means wise, so that Miledh Fene, to them, would represent the wise and his division, by whom he was informed of the disasters that had befallen his brothers Aireagh and Colpa, who had perished on that coast. The brothers now uniting their forces, formed their plans of operation for a campaign. They determined to go in quest of the enemy, who, according to the reports of their scouts, was not far off, They began their march, and after a few days came up with the three princes of the Tuatha de Danains, in the plains of Tailton, with a. formidable army ready to meet them. The action began, and this battle, which was to decide the fate of both parties was for a long time doubtful, the troops on both sides making extraordinary efforts ; the latter to defend their patrimony against the invaders, who wished to wrest it from them ; the former, Jess to revenge the death of their countryman, than to obtain the possession of an island which had been destined for them, according to the prophecy of the druids. At length the three princes of the Tuatha de Danains, together with their principal officers, having fallen, the army was put into disorder, and the rout became so general, that more were killed in the pursuit than on the field of battle. That day, so fatal to the Tuatha de Danains, decided the em- pire of the island in favour of the Milesians. \u2014 Mac Geoghegan."], [252, "216 noble Druids, and Miledh Slioght Fene, a wise and a generous offspring. In like manner would some writers make Miledh Easpainne, the son of Golam, un der whose guidance and auspices the Iberi established themselves in the south of Ireland, to be equal in import with Milesius the Spaniard ; though others asserting that easpainne, espaine, or hespin, stood in the old Celtic for a bare, arid, and barren coun try, understood by the words, miledh espainne mac golam, noble, from the barren mountany country of Cael. But it being an acknowledged fact that the Miledh, or Milesians, whichever you choose to call them, were a Ph\u0153nician race, who put into this country from the coast of Spain, I, for. one, would derive their name, not from Milesius king of Spain \u2014 who has no existence in the records of that kingdom other than what the fictions of the poets invest him with \u2014 but from some one of the Ph\u0153nicians who had sailed over into Spain from Miletum, which was 'one of their very earliest colonies.* The Ph\u0153nicians, we know, * Greek history informs us that Miletum in Ionia was first colonised by Ph\u0153nicians from Crete \u2014 that this colony was at tacked by the Persians and transplanted into Persia\u2014 that the Ph\u0153nicians and Milesians joined with the Persians against the Ionians, at the battle of Mycale, and that they were made slaves by the Persians, but kindly treated by Alexander -and in the time of Psamiticus a colony of Milesians settled in Greece.

To them is at tributed the origin of the cities of Trebezon,* Hera clea, or Penderacleayf Sinope, J &c. After the ship wreck of Pylades and Orestes, near the temple of Diana at Taurus, the Milesians visited the Crim\u00e6a, and laid the foundations of the cities of Theodosia or Kafa,\u00a7 Chersonesus, and Oliera on the Dnieper. They also, besides other cities, built that of Odessus, or Barna, on the western shore of the black sea. But their principal one seems to have been Appollonia, or Sizeapolis,|| which was exceedingly fortified, and con- Marathon, and broke the centre of the Athenians. The Liber Lucanes, an ancient Irish MS., informs us that one colony of the Milesians arrived in Ireland in the last year of Cambnath (Cambyses) son of Ciras (Cyrus). \u2014 It then describes the divi sions of Alexander's empire among his generals, and says, another colony arrived in Ireland in that year wherein Alex ander defeated Daire, i. e.

Miledh, therefore, is not the name of a particular race, but of the city of Miletum ; nor is Milesian a proper or individual name, but a gentile or na tional one. For the Milesii were the inhabitants of Miletum, and any thing appertaining or belonging thereto was called Milesian.

Let us now pass over to other names connected with this. Espaine, Hespin, or Spania, is a word not of Celtic but of Hebraic and Syriac extraction, being derived from Span, or Sapan, a rabbit.

Hence we may see how little weight is to be attached to the reveries of those who maintain that, as Lusitania was so named from lusus, play, so was Spain from Pan the Arcadian, one of Bacchus's associates. For His- pania, the Latin for Spain, some of the ancients wrote Espaine, and now frequently Spania, which Vossius and Bochart confirm by the testimony of Paul the apostle, Theophilus, Eusebius,fEpiphanius, and others. Nay more, Eulogius, has in more places than one, written Ecclesia Spani\u0153, (that is the church of Spain) which Ambrosius Morus erroneously and unjustifiably transcribed into Ecclesia Hispani\u00e6.

There are those too to whom those words denote a standard, or ensign, or whatever is erected in an elevated and conspicuous position ; and, when connected with sacred matters, the officiating high priest or sacrificer ; a learned man ; a Druidical temple ; as the Romans gave the name of fana to the shrines wherein they worshipped their idols. They, however, come nearer to the truth who con ceive that by these words is indicated some one of the ancient colonies of the Ph\u0153nicians, who settled in Ireland. For it is an admitted and established opinion, that the Ph\u0153nician name was invented by the Greek in imitation of the Hebrew form of ex pression, phene-anak, that is, the sons of Anak, or Anaceans. Anak, as we have said, was a giant, and the son of Arba, whence comes Anakim, in the plu ral, giants ; and being the founder of that race, the Greeks thought that the inhabitants of all Syria had derived their origin from him. Indeed, it were more correct to say Bene-anak, but the Greek always soften the Hebrew letter B (beth) in this manner, as we find Josephus writing sopho instead of soba, a region of Syria. It is no wonder, therefore, that"], [258, "222 Bene-anak, Ph\u0153nices, and Punici, or P\u0153ni, should all stand for the same thing, the Ph\u0153nicians. In former times Beanak, or Phianak, was used as an abbreviation for Ben anak, and from the name thus abbreviated, the African Ph\u0153nicians* were called P\u0153ni, and those of Iberia, Fene, retaining in either case only the first member of the name, Fene-anak. But that the Ph\u0153nicians affected the name of Bene-Anak, or sons of the Anaceans, and would have them themselves so designated, you may infer from the fact of their calling the city of Carthage, built by them, Chadre Anak, that is the seat of the Ana c\u00e6ans, as you may see in the P\u00e6nulus of Plautus ; * It appears, that like some of the rest of the Pagan Afri cans, they worship a being, who, according to their imagina tions, can neither do them any good nor any evil. And which is still more remarkable, they worship another being inferior to this, whom they believe can do them much injury, unless his anger is appeased. This being they imagine frequently appears to them under the most tremendous form, somewhat resembling the ancient satyrs of the Greeks ; and when they are asked how they can believe in such absurdities, so inconsistent with the divine attributes ; their answer is to the following import : \" We follow the traditions of our ancestors, whose first parents having sinned against the grand captain, they fell into such a neglect of his worship, that they knew nothing of him, nor how to make their addresses to him.\" This may serve to shew, that however ignorant they may be in other respects, yet in this dark tradition they have some faint notion of the fall of man, which indeed is acknowledged by all the world, except some letter learned men among ourselves."], [259, "223 and, as we have observed in a preceding part of this chapter, their calling Miletum, a colony of theirs, Anactoria, from Anacte, that is, a descendant of the great Anak. For, although, but few of the Ph\u0153ni cians had really owed their origin to the family of the Anaceans-\u2014 as Bochart has before observed\u2014 yet the celebrity of the race had charms for many to make them wish and lay claim to it as their parent stock. Besides, in all nations, it is handed down as a pre sumptive usage, that they select their name from the elite of their nobility ; and amongst the Canaanites no family could compete with this either, in personal valor or the collateral influence of a splendid name. They were superhuman in strength, and so gigantic in stature that, compared to them, the Israelites ap peared like so many locusts.* * Pepin the Short, perceiving himself the object of contempt amongst a particular set of his courtiers, who on account of his figure, which was both thick and low, entertained but a mean idea of his personal abilities, invited them, by way of amusement, to see a fair battle between a bull and a lion. As soon as he observed that the latter had got the mastery over the former, and was ready to devour him, \" Now, gentlemen,\" says he, \" who amongst you all has courage enough to inter pose between these bloody combatants ? Who of you all dare rescue the bull, and kill the lion ?\" Not one of the numerous spectators would venture to undertake so dangerous an enter prise ; whereupon the king instantly leaped into the area, drew his sabre, and at one blow severed the lion's head from his shoulders.

Baxter is of opinion that the Dareni, or Darnii, taste of the Pagans, that the poets made the gods dance along with the graces, the muses, and virtues. When the Jews kept the feast of the golden calf, they sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play, which means to dance, and undoubtedly, they learned this in Egygt. Arnobius, an ancient Christian writer, asked the Pagans, if their Gods were pleased with the tinkling of brass, and rattling of cymbals, or with the sound of drums and musical instruments. The idolators in other parts of the world, even to this day, have the same esteem for this custom, and the greatest part of the worship they pay to their deities consists in dancing. On the whole it appears, that dancing was first practised by the heathens in their temples, as a part of their religious worship, to point out their gratitude to their gods, either for general, or particular favors; nor have the Christians been altogether free from this custom. The Christians of St. Thomas, dance in honor of that saint, before which they cross themselves, and sing a hymn. The men dance in one apartment, and the women in another, but both observe the greatest decency. At present, however, there are but few Roman Catholics who pay much regard to this ceremony, and in all probability it will soon fall into disrespect and cease to be practised. \u2014 Hurd.

For tuath donian, in that language, means those who meditate in silence and fasting. Nor yet would I reject the conjecture, nor deny the fact, of tuath being an Irish geographical term signifying the due north. The Caledonians were so named from Caledonia/, at this day called Scotland, after the Scoto Brigan tine Irish, and formerly Valentia by the Romans, after the name of their emperor Valentinian. They were of Brigantine extraction, and their constant allies, or rather vassals, in their several wars. The name of Caledonian is supposed to have been de rived from the woods which they inhabited, being called in the British, Kelydhon, or Colydhon, and the woods themselves, coit kelydhon. Nor, indeed, were the foreign Brigantines called Keloi on any other ac count than that of their living in the woods, as the ancients generally did, nor were the Caletes, a peo ple of the Attrebates, so denominated for any other reason. In the' Scoto-brigantine dialect of the present day, coil, means a wood. In the Greek too, kalon, means the same, as did, cala, in the ancient Roman; whence"], [270, "234 are derived caliga, a wooden shoe; and calones, hewers of timber. I suspect, however, that the Caledonians were Ph\u0153nicians, who were expert in astrology'; or, per haps, Chaldeans, associates of the Ph\u0153nicians ; for Ohaledain, or Chaldein signifies both, and that, there fore, Caledonia was named after them, and not vice versa. The Cngaanii, or Ganganii, an ancient people of Ireland, mentioned by Ptolemy, were settled in the western section of the county Clare, in what is at present called the barony of Burrin, on the south of the bay of Galway. Baxter takes them to be de scendants of the Ceangi, or shepherds of the Dam nii, who dwelt in a district called, from the summer exposure, and the habitual recumbency'of shepherds, Somers\u00e6ten, or, \u00e6stival sitters. Tacitus calls them Cangi. But as from the singular, cang, is formed the Latin ceangus, so from the plural ceangon, do they also form, canganus. Many persons believe that every individual state had^its 'own^Ceangi, who^were a co lony of minors, or of youthful shepherds, passing their lives in mountains, in villages, in marshes, or in fens, as suited the interests\"of their pastoral occupa tion. Of these, Trogus Justinus says, u they transfer their flocks now to summer, now to winter lawns. As formerly, the ancient Romans had amongst the Calabrians and Lucanians, so now have the Spaniards"], [271, "235 also amongst the Cantabrians and other states, dis tinct pastures for their flocks, as well in summer as in winter.\" The advocates of this opinion derive the word ceangus from the British ceang, or cang, a branch, in the same manner, and with the same figu rative licence, as \"youths\" in Greek are styled \" branches of Mars.\" Others think it compounded of cean gan, and interpret it, the external promon tory. Whence Canganii, to them, will express a peo ple residing beside such promontory ; as Burrin, or Bhurrin, the ancient seat of those Canganii, means an external region. There are those who flatter themselves that they have discovered the etymology of this name in the Hebrew chanoc, or chanic, ver nal ; and, finally, others who think them called Ceangi, from the god Ceangus, the tutelary genius of the Cumbri. In a matter so perplexed, and as yet so undecided, I would venture to guess that the Canganii, or Cangani, were a people of the Canta brians in Hespania Tarraconensis, who were a colony of the Massaget\u00e6, or else a tribe of Ph\u0153nician agri culturists,* and that their name is composed of the words can-gannin, a society of gardeners, from gan, a garden, applicable as well to trees as to herbs ; * Omnium rerum ex quibus aliquid acquintur, nihil est agri cultural melius, nihil uberius. nihil dulcius, nihil homine libero dignius.-Ctcero-rfe-O^c. l,c. 42."], [272, "236 or from gan-ganin, the Ganganii, who excelled in that department.* * But they say, that the modern critics have despised and rejected those chimeras of antiquity to which the Scoto-Mile- sians aspire, as well as the authorities they produce to support them.

There are but few even among the natives capable of decyphering their ancient writings : it is by a particular study only, of the abreviations, punctuations, and of the ancient characters of that language, and the Oghum, that they can attain to it. The old Scotic lan- guage, which was spoken two (or rather three) thousand years ago, and which is made ifse of in their monuments, was entirely different from what is now, and has been spoken, within the last few centuries ; and has become a jargon by the adoption of many Latin, English, and French words.

They are generally considered as refugees of the Belg\u00e6, who settled in the British islands, having come thither at the season of the Saxon war. The Aremorican tract, or line of country they inhabited, is by some writers accounted the Saxon shore of the Gauls, otherwise called Celtic Gaul, Neustria, and Britannia in the Marshes ; C\u00e6sar, however, and Pliny call it, Aquitania of the Vascons."], [274, "238 Baxter thinks that they were called Aremorici, from armor, or arvor, a shore ; as the Morini, who were the Vallonic Flandri, were called, he says, from the Celtic words, mor-eni, as if, marigen\u00e6, or sea born. With all respect, however, to so high an authority, I would venture to guess that this was one of the Ph\u0153nician tribes who arrived in this island, and passed over from it afterwards into Bel gium and Gaul. From them it is probable that the ancient city of Ardmore, in the barony of Decies, county Waterford, hath derived its name ; as also the promontory of Ardmore on the east of the Youghal harbor ; and Armoy, a town of the barony of Carey, in the county Antrim : just as the Ph\u0153 nicians who inhabited the district of Aram in Asia Major were indiscriminately called Aram\u00e6ans, Syrians, and Ph\u0153nicians, and, by a junction of the two last, Syro-Ph\u0153nicians. Whence in the Syriac version of the Bible, the Syro-Ph\u0153nician woman, mentioned in the seventh chapter, and twenty-sixth verse of St. Mark, is said to have been V from Ph\u0153 nicia of Syria.\" And Josephus declares that the Aram\u00e6ans were called Syrians by the Greeks. Strabo also asserts that some take the Syrians for the Arimi, whom they now call Arami. The Irish name Armorhac, therefore, would appear to consist of the Ph\u0153nician words Arami arac, that is, a people, or nation, from the district of Aram, namely, from Shur, that is Syria, or Ph\u0153nicia."], [275, "239 For, arac, means a state, or nation, and Arami an Aram\u00e6an, or Syrian, a native of Ph\u0153nicia; it like wise signifies anidolator; for the first worshippers of idols recorded in the sacred Scriptures were, as we have above observed, Syrians. Alobrith seems an Irish name, signifying a por tion of an ancient stock or tribe ; for, all, in Irish, means extraction, or lineage ; allod, antiquity ; and brith, a part or fraction of any thing. This I con ceive more rational, than to say that they had been called Alobrites as equivalent to Galo-Britones, which is Baxter's opinion. Nor is it more unlikely if we would suppose it a Ph\u0153nician name denoting a tribe who had concluded a treaty by the obligation of an oath; for, alah, in that language, is an oath and, brith, a league or compact, any thing about which many deliberate and ultimately agree. What if we should consider this Alobrith to be an abridgement from Baalbrith,* or berith, that is, the * Baal-Berith, or lord of the covenant, was an idol wor shipped by the Sechemite, and many of the idolatrous Israel ites erected altars to him. To him human sacrifices were offered ; and it was common to appeal to him as a witness and judge in all matters of controversy ; and, especially, when pro mises, covenants, engagements, or treaties of peace were entered into. In the most early ages of the world, the Pagans made their altars of earth or turf, and they were, for the most part, in groves or on hills, and besides offering up sacrifices to the gods, they were used for several other purposes. AH alliances with foreign princes were ratified on the altars, that"], [276, "240 Lord of the Compact ; namely, the idol with whom the children of Israel had concluded a treaty, after the manner of the Ph\u0153nicians, and in whose honor the Ph\u0153nicians had erected a temple in Gebal, a mountain and city at the foot of Mount Libanus, whence the circumjacent country hath obtained the name of Gebalene. This temple was restored in the time of Alexander the Great, and consecrated, by some despicable enthusiasts of the Pagan priesthood, \" To Olympian Jove, the patron of hospitality.\" For few things are better known than that the Alobrites, as well as the other nations of Gaul, of Belg\u00e6, and of Britannia, had embraced the idolatry and the rites of the Ph\u0153nicians. It is very probable, also, that the Morini were those whom the ancient Irish called Morintinneach, high-spirited ; or the Ph\u0153nicians, Marin, lords, or Morin, teachers. Unless, perhaps, they may have been inhabitants of the land of Jerusalem, and so denominated from Mount Moriah, which is situated the gods might be witness of the faithful performance of them ; of this we have many instances both in ancient history and poetry. Thus, Hamilcar made his son Hannibal lay his hand on the altar, and swear he would never make peace with the Romans ; and thus a poet says : \u2014 \" I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names : Whatever chance befal on either side, No term of time this union shall divide.\""], [277, "241 by the side of Mount Sion. We have already hinted, above, that the Ph\u0153nicians, like the other nations of antiquity, made it an established rule, that whenever they emigrated into foreign countries they should, through national affection, and a wish to perpetuate the remembrance of the present stock, transfer to their tribes and families the names of the cities or provinces, mountains or rivers, that were associated with their childhood; a fact which we could prove by innumerable examples in the con duct, as well of the Ph\u0153nicians themselves, as of the Celts, the Greeks, nay, of the Romans and the Arabians in Spain, and recently in the conduct of the Spaniards themselves, in North and South America. But it may suffice to adduce the instance of the Aradii, ancient inhabitants of Ireland, who made several voyages and maritime excursions, in com pany with the Ph\u0153nicians. These were originally inhabitants of the island of Arad, on the coast of Phenice, at the mouth of the river Eleutherus, and with part of the adjoining continent, such as Antar adus, Marathus, Laodicea, the principal city of the island, and which bore the same name, Strabo says had been built by some Sydonian exiles, and that the Aradians contributed much to the advancement of naval'science. We must not wonder, therefore, when, on allusion to this, we read in Ezekiel's pro phecy, that roivers from Arad and Sidon had held R"], [278, "242 possession of Tyre ; nor when, in a subsequent verse of the same chapter, we find that, in the vigor of their bravery, they with all their forces had mounted upon its walls, and nobly fought in its defence. And not only Tyre but Tripolis, the most illustrious city of Phenice, consisted, as Pliny tells us, partly of Aradians, and partly of Tyrians and Sidonians. That from this island the Aradians, in conjunction with the Ph\u0153nicians, had sailed over into Spain, and there built the town of Arades amongst the Assures, Aradilli amongst the Vaccei, and Aradueniga amongst the Carpetani, all called after their own name, is to me certain as demonstration can make it. Ardisa also, formerly a city, now a small town of Celtiberia ; Ardisalsdo and Ardisana, villages in the country of the Assures ; Ardaiz, amongst the Canta brians, and others of that kind in various quarters of Spain, seem to me indisputably as colonies of the Aradians. It is the opinion of a certain very learned person, that the river of Araduey also, amongst the Palentines, was called after them ; although others think the name derived from the Greek, ardeuo, to moisten. Again, that from Spain, still in company with the Ph\u0153nicians, the Aradians had shifted across to our coast, and there established a permanent colony, we may be assured, I think, from the names of the old districts of Ard and Arad Cliach, which comprise a"], [279, "243 great part of the county Tipperary ; as well as of the tract of Ardes in the county Down ; and the citadel of Ardea in the county Kerry* I pass over the names of other towns, beginning, like the Spanish, from the word Ard, and still used popularly and vernacularly as their current designations in the Irish geography. That a tribe of the Armenians, also, along with the Ph\u0153nicians, had arrived in this country, may be inferred from the names of Cany Rock, a town on the sea coast of the barony of Balruddery, in the county Dublin ; of Knordoe, a town in the county Galway ; of Cahirdonel, a village in the county Kerry, where are to be seen the ruins of an old cir cular fortress, almost impregnably fortified, and con- * In the name of this county we discover the commercial nation by whom it was first inhabited ; for Cearagh, its Irish name, is derived from cear, a merchant ; whence comes, ciara ban, a company of merchants, equivalent to the eastern, cara van, of the same signification. \" O, native, (Kerry!)

That this Cardanian or Armenian people had seized themselves of Spain also, in conjunction with the Ph\u0153nicians, we have proof clearer than the moonlight, in numberless names of places in that country; for instance, Cardena, the name of a river of the Vaccei ; Cardenu, or Cardenus, a river of the Ilergetes, flowing into the Rubricatum, now the Llobregat ; Cardenas, a town of Cantabria ; Carden chosa, a little village of B\u0153tica ; Cardona, a very ancient city of the Ilergetes ; with the towns of Cardenosa, Cardenete, Cardena, Cardenueta, &c. in different parts of the kingdom."], [281, "245 CHAP.

The Attacoti,* mentioned by St. Jerom as ancient inhabitants of Ireland, gave their name to the country, or rather province, of Attacottia, which the * Gibbon has given a very strange perversion to a sentence in St. Jerom respecting the Attacotti, which runs thus : \" Et quum per sylvas porcorum greges et armcntorum pecudumque reperiunt, pastorum nates et ferminarum papillas solere abscin- dere, et has solas ciborum delicias arbitrari,\" \u2014 which the historian thus translates, \" They curiously selected the most delicate and brawny parts of both males and females, which they prepared for their horrid repasts.\" But he was misled by the word pastorum, which is not the genitive plural of pastor, a shepherd, but of pastus, meaning well-fed ; and thus the sentence should be : \" When the Attacotti, wandering through the woods, meet with flocks and herds of black cattle, sheep, and pigs, they are in the habit of cutting off the rumps of the fat or well-fed he beasts, and the udders of the she ones ; and consider these as the only delicate parts of the animals.\" That"], [282, "246 Emperor Constantine, from his own name, after wards called Flavia C\u00e6sariensis. But as this people are not to be met with in Ptolemy's commentaries, Baxter has been induced to believe that the Silures, together with their dependants, the Demeti and Cornavii, and the Cangani, who were their vassals, again, had obtained this designation at a later period of the Roman empire. For what does Attacotti mean, he says, but, dwelling in the woods ? For At-a-coit, written loosely, means, in the woods. This he con firms by some verse from Condelia, called Prydydh Maus, or the great poet ; whence he conjectures that the Irish Attacotti were named from the syno nymous term Argoet, and Argoetnys, meaning men beside woods ; or, as the old Leomarchus would take it, Guyr Argoet. The condition of the country, which this custom, barbarous and savage as it is, was frequent amongst the ancients is evident, from that text of scripture, which says : \u2014 -Neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field. Mr. Bruce, the traveller, threw light upon this command, by stating- that this practice exists in Abyssinia, where pieces of flesh are cut out of the animals alive and eaten ; the creature being kept alive for further use. This statement was long con sidered as a traveller's exaggeration, but it has subsequently been found to be true. The prohibition might have a two-fold object, first, to prevent the imitation of the cruel practices of the heathen ; and, secondly, to prevent the light treatment of blood, when the blood which was the life of the beast was shed in the sacrifices, being emblematical of the blood of the covenant. \u2014 See Dr. A. Clarke. The Attacotti, however, were not Irish at all, but a canton of England."], [283, "247 every one must be aware from the poem of Higdenus, to have been woody and uncultivated, even so late as the Norman times, agrees well with this conjec ture, to which we must add Ammianus Marcellinus's testimony to the effect, that the Attacoti, assisted by the Saxons, the Scots, and the Picts, had ravaged and laid waste the Roman province. I imagine, however, that their nation was more ancient; and would be disposed to refer their arrival in this country to the times of the Ph\u0153nicians, whom it is more than probable the Chut\u00e6i had accompanied in their maritime excursions. The Chut\u00e6i or Chuti were natives of the country of Persis, called Cuth, who after the dispersion of the ten tribes were carried off from Chuthah and the other cities of that empire, into Ph\u0153nice, by Salamansar, King of As syria ; and they and their posterity were, for the most part, so called, because the greater number of them were from the city Chuthah. Being intermixed with the Ph\u0153nicians, they introduced into their cities the worship of the idol Nergel, which many suppose to have been, tharingol, that is, a dunghill cock, which they had perched upon a pole in the air, as the herald of the dawn. The word Attacotti, therefore, conveys to my ear the same idea as Atha-Chuthi did to the Ph\u0153nicians, and that is, the arrival of the Cutheans ; or as Athar-Cuthi, a place or country where the Chut\u00e6ans reside ; or as Chut\u00e6i scouts,"], [284, "248 in keeping with the character of the people, which Zosimus designates as a warlike nation. From the Attacotti would seem to have been de rived Annacotty, the name of a town in the county Limerick ; for Anna, in the Ph\u0153nician, hanna, means delightful, acceptable. This name, if we suppose it composed of the words Hanna-Chuttai, will mean, a place acceptable to the Ph\u0153nician Chutheans ; or if we suppose its component parts to have been Anakia-Chuti, it will then mean the offspring of the Ph\u0153nician Chutheans. Or, perhaps, it bears refer ence to the idol Ana-Meloch, which the Ph\u0153nicians borrowed from the Chuth\u00e6ans and other Assyrians, in which case you may render it by, the oracle of Moloch ; \u2014 aonah or onah, being, an answer. On these points, however, let every one judge as he thinks fit. I volunteer my guesses, principally to elicit those of others. Before any such appear, perhaps the curious in antiquarian lore may recognise other vestiges of the Cuth\u00e6ans in the name, Cot's Rock, now Castlemary, in the county Cork, where is to be seen an immense stone altar, supported by three others. Inis Cathay, too, now Inis Scattery,* an island at the mouth of the \u2022 Scattery isMud is about three miles from the shore, and contains about one hundred and eighty acres of choice laud : a priory was founded here, by St. Sennan, in the sixth century. It is recorded in St. Sennan's life, that during his residence in"], [285, "249 river Shannon, where there is still standing, in toler able preservation, one of the Round Towers in which this country abounds, may seem a vestige of Cuth\u00e6an occupancy ; so may Cath, also the name of a rock on the coast of the county Cork ; as well as Cotton, an extensive district' in the county Down ; and Cot land, a small town in the county Kildare. That the Ph\u0153nicians too, who had originally landed in Spain, had been Chuth\u00e6ans, appears to be indicated by the name of Cotinussa, by which, as Festus Avienus and Pliny inform us, the island of Gades was once known ; by the names of the towns of Cuthar in B\u0153tica; Cutanda and Cotanda in Cel- this island, which was then called Inis Cathay, a ship arrived there, bringing fifty monks, Romans by birth, who were drawn into Ireland by the desire of a more holy life and a knowledge of the scriptures.

The Druids, Magicians and Soothsayers \u2014 Whence named \u2014 The introducers of human immolation and human divination amongst the people of the West. It is admitted on all hands that the soothsayers and magicians, and as such \u2014 conformably to ancient custom, \u2014 the magistrates of the ancient Britons and Gauls, had been called Druids in the British language.* We have the authority of Pliny for * Of all the ancient heathen systems of religion, the Druid ical comes nearest to that of the Carthagenians ; but then it will be naturally asked, how, or in what manner did the ancient Britons become acquainted with the religion of a people, who,"], [287, "251 stating, that these had transmitted the science of the Magi, or the art of Magic, to the Chaldeans and Persians. Undoubtedly Orph\u00e6us,* who was one of their number, taught music and theology to the Greeks.f The Gauls and the inhabitants of the British isles, had, as C\u00e6sar and Tacitus inform us, their own Druids. With both nations did the custom of sacrificing human victims to their idols prevail, which Cicero and others record of the Gauls, as Pliny does of the Britons ; and perhaps it would not in point of locality, were situated at avast distance from them? To a thinking person, this would afford much instruction, be cause it will serve to convince him, that the account of the dispersion of Noah's children, as related in Genesis x. is genuine ; and that all idolatry originated from the mistaken notions which men embraced, after their dispersion on the face of the earth, when they vainly attempted to build the Tower of Babel. Lastly, the Carthagenians, or Ph\u0153nicians, carried on a very extensive commerce with the natives of Britain ; a circumstance which could not easily have taken place in those barbarous ages, unless their religions, manners, and customs had nearly resembled each other. That they did so, we have many evidences remaining in Britain, particularly in Devon shire and Cornwall ; and to support this assertion, we have the testimony of the best Greek and Roman historians. * We should observe that the ancient name for a harp, in Irish, is Orpheam, an evident derivation from this great musi cian's name. f Whilst their first taught creed, the mystic or philosophical religion of an earlier age, came to them directly from India itself.

The Concani too, who were a part of the Cantabrians, as we have said above, residing in Hispania Tarraconensis, and a colony of the Massaget\u00e6, had some things in common with the Sarmatians, Thracians, and Scy thians, as far as regards cruelty and beastly pro pensities. The word Druid some would derive from the Celtico-Germanic, deruidhon, which means exceeding wise ; for, der, or, dre, in Celtic, is the same as, deur or, door, in the German Celto-Scythic ; as are their compounds Druides and Deurwitten. Others choose to derive it from druis, which, both in the Celtic and German, is equivalent to trowis or truvis, that is, a teacher of truth and faith. Others from the British and German, dru, faith ; by some called tru ; whence too, God was called by the antient Germans, Drutin or Trudin, as you may see in the gospel of Othfridus ; Drudin, therefore, may signify either, divine or faith ful; either term being applicable to the priesthood. Others from the old British word, drus, a d\u00e6mon or magician ; or the Saxon dry, an enchanter, whilst others, in fine, would derive it from the Greek, drus,"], [289, "253 an oak, and that solely because of Pliny's remark, that * they make choice of oak groves, neither do they celebrate any sacred rites without that tree, so much so that they may seem to have been thence denominated by a Greek derivation.\"* What Lucan says of them would seem to bear upon this, viz. f deep groves, in remote uncultivated forests.\" Whence the Greeks, by an old taunt, used to call them, Saronides, from the worship of old oaks, which that word originally and properly signified. They who hold out for the Celtic etymology say, that this explanation would be satisfactory enough, if the Gauls had received the Druids from the Massilienses, and they from the Phocenses. But the Druids were unknown to the Greeks, so that we must look altogether for their origin in the Celtic, especially as it is supposed, on the authority of C\u00e6sar and Tacitus, that the Gauls had borrowed them from the British isles. Every one will doubtless judge for himself. To my ear the word sounds of a Syro-Chaldaic, or Ph\u0153nician descent, yet could I not dare to specify * In the Irish annals, Magh, a Magian priest, is sometimes put for Draoi, a Druid. The Druidical religion was at first ex tremely simple; but such is the corruption of human nature, that it was soon debased by abominable rites and ceremonies, in the same manner as was practised by the Canaanites, the Carthagenians, and by all the heathens in the other parts of the world."], [290, "254 its precise signification.

Drur or dreur, also, in that language, means exemption from work or ser vitude ; freedom from debt or demand, &c.

Each word he utters is listened to with the utmost attention, and is deemed as sacred as that of an oracle. All their religious worship, however, does not absolutely consist in this; for they have their particular sacrifices as well as others.

Diodorus Siculus speaking of them says, \" Whenever they deliberate upon matters of importance, they observe a wonderful and almost incredible custom : for they sacrifice a man, and from some old established ob servation upon matters, affect to know the future by the circumstances of his fall, whether it be from some accident, or the laceration of his limbs, or the flow of his blood.\" Tacitus, too, says, \" the Druids held it lawful to offer upon the altars the blood of their captives, and dive into futurity by the fibres of human victims.\"* This custom the Spaniards observed, * When the lights, after being just taken out, were found still panting, it was looked upon to be so happy an omen, that all other presages were considered as indifferent or of no con sequence ; because, said they, this alone sufficed to make them propitious, how unhappy soever they might be. After they had taken out the harslet, they blew up the bladder with their breath, then tied it up at the end, or squeezed it close with their hands, observing at the same time how the passages, through which the air enters into the lungs, and the small veins which are generaly found there, were swelled ; because the more they were inflated, the more the omen was propitious. They also observed several other particulars, which it would be a difficult matter for us to relate. They looked upon it as an ill omen, if while they were rip ping up the beast's side, it rose up and escaped out of the hands of those who held it down, and they also looked upon it as ill boding, if the bladder, which generally joins to the harslet, happened to break, and had thereby prevented the taking it out entire ; or if the lights were torn, or the heart putrified, and so on."], [293, "257 having borrowed it, no doubt, from them or some others of the Ph\u0153nician priesthood. \" The Lusitani,\" says Strabo, \" study immolation, and inspect the en trails of their victims before they have been cut out: they also examine the veins of the sides, and pretend to divination by touching.

They cut off the right hands of the prisoners of war, and consecrate them to the gods.\" The same Diodorus Siculus says, that the Druids had a custom \" of offering no sacrifice without a philosopher to officiate : for they thought that sacred rites should be performed only by men conscious of the divine nature, and as such in a near relation to the gods.\"* They attended also at the sacrifices * Some of their priests were extremely ingenious, and made amulets, or rings of glass, variegated in the most curious manner, of which many are still to be seen. They were worn as we do rings on the finger ; and having been consecrated by one of the Druids, they were considered as charms, or pre servatives against witchcraft, or all the machinations of evil spirits. From what remains of these amulets, or rings, they seem to have been extremely beautiful, composed of blue, red, and green, intermixed with white spots ; all of which contained something emblematical, either of the life of the persons who wore them, or of the state to which they were supposed te enter. S"], [294, "258 of the Gauls, at which, Tertullian tells us, they were in the habit of offering human victims to Mercury. And Menutius Felix says, \" the Gauls slay human, or rather, inhuman, victims.\" Strabo, speaking of their sacrifices, which had been invented, or at least patronized, by the Druids, says, \" they used in their sacred offices to pierce some individuals to death by arrows, or else crucify them ; or having reared up a pillar of hay and stuck a wooden pole therein, they used to burn cattle and animals of every description, nay, men themselves, whole and unmutilated.\" And Diodorus Siculus, \" criminals kept for five years, they nail to the stakes, and sacrifice to the gods, and with other first fruits, immolate over immense funeral piles.\"* Which practices, as well as the others apper taining to idolatrous ritual, were common to the Spaniards and Britons, and its various Celtic tribes. But as the first Druids were, in my opinion, the sacrificing priests of the Ph\u0153nicians, it is very likely that they borrowed this bloody and atrocious super stition from the Ph\u0153nicians, of whom Porphyry says, * And barbarous indeed was the manner in which it was done : the victim, stripped naked, and his head adorned with flowers, was chained with his back to an oak, opposite the place where the Arch-Druid stood ; and while music of all sorts, then in use, was playing, the Druid, having invoked the gods to accept of the sacrifice, walked forward with a knife in his hand, and stabbed the victim in the bowels. The music pre vented his cries from being heard by the people ; it was some times four or five hours before he expired."], [295, "259 ' the Ph\u0153nicians used to sacrifice on occasions of great calamity\u2014 whether of war, of draught, or of pestilence\u2014 some certain one of their dearest friends, appointed for this purpose by common suffrage.\" And Eusebius : \" The Ph\u0153nicians used yearly to sacrifice their most beloved friends, nay, their only sons.\" What wonder is it then that the greater part of the religions of the barbarians should have at length accorded with the Ph\u0153nicians in this human immolation, finding it an easy transition, from sa crifice to malefice, from piety to enormity, from the blood of victims to the murder of man? a thing not only savage and revolting in the act, but monstrous and horrible even in idea ! The Thessalians we find used annually to sacrifice a man to Peleus and Chiron ; so used the Scythians foreigners to Diana. As the Syrians used to slay a virgin annually in honor of Pallas, so used the Arabians a boy. The Curetes, like the Ph\u0153nicians, used to sacrifice some of their children to Saturn ; the Lacedemonians, a man to Saturn ; the Chians, another to Bacchus ; the Salaminians, another to Diomed ; and the Rho dians, another to Saturn ;* whilst the Phrigians, in * Saturn was the deity whom the Carthagenians principally worshipped ; and he was the same with what is called Moloch in Scripture.

The Athenians, oppress ed by a frightful famine on account of the assassination of Androgeos, consulted the oracle ; when they got for their reply, that they must send fourteen souls every year to Crete for sacrifice. The Italians themselves used to sacrifice every tenth man, or the tithe of their population, to Apollo and Juno.

Private persons imitated the conduct of their princes ; and thus, in time, the practice became general ; nay, to such a height did they carry their infatuation, that those who had no children of their own, purchased those of the poor, that they might not be deprived of the benefits of such a sacri fice, which was to procure them the completion of their wishes. This horrid custom prevailed long among the Ph\u0153nicians, the Tyrians, aud the Carthagenians, and from them the Israelites borrowed it, although expressly contrary to the order of God. * The ancient idolaters of Peru offered not only the fruits of the earth and animals to these gods, but also their captives, like ihe rest of the Americans. We are assured, that they used to sacrifice their own children, whenever there was a scarcity of victims. These sacrifices were performed by cutting open the victims alive, and afterwards tearing out their hearts ; they then smeared the idol, to whom they were sacrificing, with the blood"], [297, "261 It was chiefly on account of these human sacrifices that Augustus C\u00e6sar interdicted to his subjects the introduction of the Druidical religion. Tiberius re moved it from the city ; and Claudius abolished it in the Gauls themselves. Yet have we the lament able truth to record, that this cruel rite was again revived and perpetuated, at a subsequent period, in Gaul and elsewhere, as Lampridius, Vopiscus, and Eusebius, but too mournfully testify.* Some Spaniards suppose that vestiges of the Druids of that Peninsula are still preserved, in the depraved names of Drada and Dradas, which are small towns belonging to the ancient Lusitania, which became afterwards the jurisdiction of the yet reeking, as was the custom of Mexico. The priest burnt the victim's heart, after having viewed it in order to see whether the sacrifice would be agreeable to the idol. Some other idol ators offered their own blood to their deities, which they drew from their arms and thighs, according as the sacrifice was more or less solemn ; and they even used, on extraordinary occasions, to let themselves blood at the tips of their nostrils, or between the eye-brows. We are however to observe, that these kinds of bleeding were not always an act of religious worship, but were often employed purely to prevent diseases. \u2014 Hurd. * No idolatrous worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the ancient Gauls and Britons ; and the Romans, after their conquest, finding it impossible to reconcile those nations to the laws and institutions of their masters, were at last obliged to abolish the Druidical system by penal statutes a violence which had never, in any other instance, been prac tised by those tolerating conquerors.\" \u2014 Hume's Engl.

News of this having been sent to Rome, Seutonius, a gallant commander, was sent over to Britain, in order to subdue the insurgents, and the whole body of the Druids, calling in the aid of superstition, retired to the island of Mona, since called Angle sey, in North Wales. To that island the Roman general pur sued them ; and such were the hopes that the Druids had of success, that when the Romans made their appearance, they lighted up fires in their groves, in order to consume them. The Romans, however, put most of the Britons to the sword ; and having taken the Druids prisoners; burnt them alive on their altars, and cut down their consecrated groves. From that time we have but few accounts of the Druids in the southern parts of Britain, although there is the strongest reason to believe, that both in the western parts, and likewise in Ireland, their religion continued much longer. \u2014 Hurd."], [299, "263 CHAP.

In sup port of this I shall adduce, first, the authority of Artemidorus, who says that \" there is an island near Britain, in which sacrifices used to be offered to Ceres* * Prima Ceres ferro mortales vertere terrain, instituit. \u2014 Virg. Geor. i. 7."], [300, "264 and to Proserpine, in the same manner as in Samo thrace.\" \" Nor is there any reason,\" adds Bochart, \" that any one should think its inhabitants had the Greeks as their instructors at the time of Artemido rus, who wrote in the reign of Ptolemy Latyrus : the learned know well that no Greek ever landed in Britain : it remains, therefore, that those same Ph\u0153nicians, from whom the Samothracians had learned the worship of the Cabiri, had initiated those also in the same discipline.\" In like manner, are we furnished with proofs \u2014 as well from other memorials as from certain terms used by the Irish people, which savor strongly of the idolatrous ritual \u2014 that they had instructed in the principles of their superstition not only the Irish, but the Spaniards too, and every other people amongst whom they could get sooting as a colony. To begin with Astarte or Astaroth, the deity of the Ph\u0153nicians, and the groves dedicated to her, we may observe the evidence of her having been worshipped in Ireland, in the name of that town in the county Donegal, by the river Erne, called Astroth, or, otherwise, Ashro ; in Ardsrath or Ard stra, the name of a town by the river Deirg, in the county Antrim, now called Bathlure ; in Aterit, the name of an ancient district and borough in the county Galway, now called Athenry or Atenree. For Ashro is the Ph\u0153nician word, Ashra, a grove or shrubbery that is worshipped ; or a tree planted"], [301, "265 in honor of some idol beside his shrine or altar ; for the Ph\u0153nicians, like the other idolators of the east, were wont to plant a tree by the temples or altars of their divinities, as a meeting-place for the congre gation ; a custom which, perhaps, had its rise from the similar one universally observed by the easterns, of planting trees over the graves of their illustrious men or heroes* A specimen of this custom we still see in the linden or elm trees planted over ancient ceme tries. Spain, too, has to this day, in the district of Cantabria, a celebrated tree of this sort, which they call, de Garnica; under the branches of which, from the earliest date, the people have been accustomed to celebrate their general elections. That the idolators used to worship a tree situated in the centre of a garden may be inferred from the sixty-seventh chapter, and seventeenth verse of Isaiah. Holy writ speaks in more places than one, of woods or groves consecrated to Baal, a superstition which the Lord prohibited to Israel. The people, however, forgetting the Lord their God, are said afterwards to have worshipped Baalim and Ashroth or Asheroth, that is his groves. Which observance the Greeks and Romans in after times adopted.

Unquestionably Jupiter was called Endendros by the Rhodians, as was Bacchus by the B\u0153tians, from their being worshipped in groves, as this epithet signifies. Diana, too, was called Nemorensis, or presiding over groves, as she was also Arduenra, and the Albunean goddess, from a grove and forest of those respective names. Conformable to this is what we read of King Manasses, namely, that he laid down in the temple of the Lord, pesel hasherah, or ashrah, the idol of the grove. The first king who is recorded to have consecrated a grove under that name is Achab. What follows is in keeping with this, viz. \"And they made themselves statues and groves in every high hill, and under every shady forest.\" But why under every leafy oak they burned fragrant incense to all their idols may be in ferred from Hosea, iv. 13, where it is said they did so \" because its shade is good.\" It will be enough for our purpose merely to hint that the oak to which the worship was offered, is understood by Salomon Jarchi as the word Asherah, which signifies an oak grove ; and that from it seems to be taken the sense of that"], [303, "267 passage in Isaiah, lvii. 5, \" Ye comfort yourselves with your gods under every green tree ;\" the Hebrew text has elim, which the Septuagint and English versions render by idols. They, therefore, who understand by those scripture texts, not the real trees, but the idols consecrated by that name, bring forward in proof of this acceptation the lofty oak, which Maximus Tyrius assures us, had been a statue of the Celtic Jove. And, indeed, that Asharah means not a place planted with trees, as Flavius Josephus supposes, but actually a deity, or rather a false god, may be concluded from the fact of King Manasses having placed an idol of that name, and that too of wood, in the temple of Jerusalem. Whence, perhaps, by the terms oak and grove, is intended a reproach upon their fictitious, fragile, and perishable divinities ; as we find it to have been burned by King Josias, and ground to dust and then flung over the groves of the populace. In other places, also, the word Asherath or grove, is taken for the wooden image of Belus, which was consecrated above his altar. We likewise frequently meet with images dedicated to Astarte or Astaroth, called Asherim and Asheroth, or groves ; that, both, an attention may be enlisted by the allusion of the name, and a material so inade quate to divinity find that merited reproach which the very sound must convey.

Nor would they have done so, but that his parents were not known. We see, then, that the idol Astrath or Astharoth, was also called Astharte, of which Lucian of Samo sata thus speaks : \"Now there is another temple in Ph\u0153nicia which the Sidonians have, and by name Astharte as they themselves call it ; but I consider Astharte to be the moon.\" Whence Eusebius hands down from Philo, that Astharte had the head of a bull placed upon her own as theensign of royalty ; that by his curved front he may imitate fire, and exhibit at the same time the appearance of the moon. Nor can we conceive any more appropriate symbol of the moon than an ox's head, representing as it does by its horns the moon's curvature; as the Egyptian Isis, \u2014 by which likewise was meant the moon \u2014 was in vested by that people with a pair of horns. All which characteristics clearly accord with the Diana of the Greeks and Latins, whom Horace designates as true God, and the primitive patriarchal institutions ; by these the father of every family was both king and priest. By Salem most judicious interpreters allow that Jerusalem, is meant. From the use made of this part of the sacred history by David, (Psa. ex. 4.) and by St. Paul, (Heb. vii. 1\u201410.) we learn that there was something very mysterious, and at the same time typical, in the person, name, office, residence, and government of this Canaanitish prince."], [306, "270 \" mistress of the woods.\" Whence it is evident that Astharte is the moon or Diana ; groves having been consecrated to her, as Vossius and others have de monstrated. From Astharte the septuagint has given the name of, Astarteion, to the temple of As tharoth or Beth Astaroth; where the Palestines* deposited or consecrated the arms of Saul, whom they slew. You also meet Astartion in Flavius Josephus. There are those who maintain that Astaroth or Astharte was so called, from its images having been made in the form of a sheep, and considering Aster oth to mean, flocks. Others suspect it was so named from the multitude of its victims. Others considered Astharte to be Venus, whom Procopius, of Gaza, asserts to have been worshipped by the Sidonians, and to have had groves planted in honor of her. * The appellation of Palestine, by which the whole land of Canaan appears to have been called in the days of Moses, is derived from the Philistines, a people who migrated from Egypt, and, having expelled the aboriginal inhabitants, settled on the borders of the Mediterranean ; where they became so considerable as to give their name to the whole country, though they in fact, possessed only a small part of it. The Philistines were for a long time the most formidable enemies of the children of Israel, but about the year of the world 3841, that is, before Christ 159, the illustrious Judas Maccabeus subdued their country ; and about sixty-five years afterwards Jann\u00e6us burnt their city Gaza, and incorporated the remnant of the Philistines with such Jews as he placed in their country.

This has led some to conclude that the Gauls, too, and the Britons made no use of idols in their Druid ical ceremonies: and hence that it was not to be wondered at that none were ever found in the ruins of their old temples throughout this island. But it is manifest from Holy writ, that the Ph\u0153nicians had Baal, and Astharoth, and Moloch, and other like nesses of their deities, for idols. That the ancient Irish worshipped idols will appear equally evident from what Diodorus Siculus tells us of the \" Hyper borean\" island, \"Where,\" he says, \" peculiar worship is paid to Apollo, whom they worship every day with incessant singing of praises,* and in honor of whom * One would suppose that the most ancient sort of poetry consisted in praising the Deity ; for, if we conceive a being, created with all his faculties and senses, endued with speech and reason, to open his eyes iu a most delightful plain, to view for the first time the serenity of the sky, the splendor of the sun, the verdure of the fields and woods, the glowing colours of the flowers, we can hardly believe it possible that he should refrain from bursting in an ecstacy of joy, and pouring his praises to the creator of those wonders, and the author of his happiness.

But, more than abundant on this idolaters : every one knows that the dramatic poetry of the Europeans took its rise from the same spring, and was no more at first than a song in praise of Bacchus; so that the only species of poetical composition, (if we except the epic,) which can in any sense be called imitative, was deduced from a natural emotion of the mind, in which imitation could not be at all concerned. \u2014 Sir W.

As, therefore, the Iberes in Spain worshipped after the Ph\u0153nician fashion, the sun and moon, under the guise of Baal and Astharoth, so did the Irish embrace the same superstitions from the lbero-Ph\u0153nicians, as well as the worship of those images that prevailed amongst them. Nor is it to be wondered at, if, in the old walls of those temples \u2014 which Ireland still pre serves, despite the ravages of time \u2014 there are no such images as those to be met with, as I am perfectly as sured that St. Patrick and the other preachers of the gospel, took particular care to overthrow, \u2014 to extir pate, and, like Josias, to burn, \u2014 every vestige of an idol that came in their way or could possibly be met with. This I can more immediately testify with respect to Spain, where no appearance of the like is to be found, by digging beneath the rubbish of old castles or towns ; * S. Eleranus sapiens in Vita S.

I will instance the town of Gades, in which Philostratus bears record there were deities worshipped that were scarcely elsewhere known or heard of. \u0152lian tells us that it had one altar sacred to the year, and another to the month, in honor of time, of those respective durations. There, too, poverty had an altar, as well as art and old age ; and death also, which, as Philostratus tells us, they used to celebrate with songs of joy; unless, perhaps, by death we are to understand, Pluto ; whom it is well known, from Sanchoniathon, that the Ph\u0153 nicians used to call Muth, which means death. But to return from this digression. Nor ought we to wonder that the Ph\u0153nicians should have named those towns in Ireland after their idol Astharoth, or Astharte, and the groves consecrated thereto ; for there was a city also of the name in Ph\u0153nicia, the royal residence of Og king of Basan, in which the modern Jews will have it, that the house of Job was situated. We have, however already proved, and without the possi bility of doubt, from the ancient geography of Spain, that several of its towns and villages, as well as also its distinguished cities, have been named from the groves, or mountains, or caves wherein they used to offer their devotions ; as well as from the idols themselves to whom they used to offer them."], [311, "275 To these I add the example of the name Astarte,* or Astharoth, at present under discussion : for it is to me unquestionable, that, from the worship of this idol, arose the names of the Spanish villages of As trar, amongst the ancient Suevi, in the department of Compostella ; Asteire, in the Lucanian territory ; Astariz, in the Ariensian tract ; with the town of Astrain, and the deserted and almost ruinated little village of Astrea amongst the Cantabrians. Nor should I think those to be far astray, who \u2014 merely expunging the initial letter, as is usual in other geo graphical names of Spain \u2014 conceive that, from the idol Asthartes, originated the name of Tartessus,f the most ancient city which the Ph\u0153nicians built near Calpe and the pillars of Hercules. This I beg leave to say with all deference to the authority of the poets of Spain, who, with Ovid at their head, insist that Tartessus is the extreme section of the west, and who think it so called from the river Tartessus, whose source is in the silver mountain of Oros-pedda, which abounds in mines of that metal ; or whose sides, say they, being overlaid with tin, exhibit the appearance of so much silver. * Astore, that word of bland endearment, and familiar con verse amongst the native Irish, implying, my refulgent delight, is an evident emanation from this Astarte or Lunar Goddess. t Sic k Emerita, expuncta priore syllaba, dicimus Merida : k C\u0153saraugusta, Zaragoza: * Via, Auson\u00e6, Vic.

But the place wherein this idol's sacrifices used to be performed, was called Malken, or Malaken. Molock, or Milcom was expressly the deity of the Ammonites, amongst whom he had a temple in the city of Gebal, and in it an image of stone, overlaid with gold, and seated upon a throne ; on either side of him were two female images, also seated, and in front an altar, whereon the sacrifices and incense used to be offered up. But the Assyrians, who had been carried away into Samaria, had other idols of Moloch, which they called Adra-Melech and Ana- Melech, that is, the brave and magnificent Moloch ; for adir, which is one of the attributes of the deity, signifies great, powerful, excellent, or magnificent. And no wonder, for as the Chaldee paraphrast, com monly known under the disguise of Jonathan, ob serves, \" the Gentiles called their idols after the name of the Lord Jehovah.\" Which is the opinion of several of the Hebrews \" conceiving,\" as St. Jerome says,"], [314, "278 \" that their idols were made in the name of the Lord, and after his likeness. Let the learned judge, whether or not, the town of Ard Mulchan in this island, had not been so called from the name of the idol Adra Malcum- Moloch was represented with the face of a calf, having his hands stretched out ready to receive any thing offered by the bystanders ; it was a concave image, with seven distinct compartments ; one they used to open for offering flour, another for turtles, the third for a sheep, the fourth for a ram, the fifth for a calf, the sixth for an ox, but whoever affected to be so exceedingly religious as to sacrifice a son for him, as a mark of special approbation, they would open the seventh.* Under the symbol of this idol the * The Rabbins say it was made of brass, the body resembling that of a man, and the head that of a calf, with a royal diadem, and the arms extended. They add, that when children were to be offered to him, they heated the statue, and put the mise rable victim between his arms, where it was soon consumed by the violence of the flame. From the whole of this we may learn, that human sacrifices were the most acceptable at the altars of Moloch; which, undoubtedly, made our great poet Milton rank him among the infernal deities, as one of the fallen angels ; and as one who was to be a curse to the idolatrous world. \" First Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood Of human sacrifices, and parents' tears ; Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud, Jj Their children's cries unheard, that passed thro' fire To his grim idol.\""], [315, "279 Ph\u0153nicians used to worship the sun and Saturn, namely, that large star in the firmament which they used to call Melee, king of all the rest. They who think Saturn to have been the Moloch of the Ph\u0153nicians, seem to gain countenance in the idea from the practice of sacrificing children to Mo loch ; which they, in common with the Carthaginians observed ; whilst we know from the Greek and Latin writers that victims used also to be sacrificed to Saturn. But the scriptures inform us, in divers places, that the Syrians had unnaturally burned their own seed, their own sons and daughters, in honor of this deity. This abominable sacrifice of the idol, then, consisted in dragging children through the fire, and by the hands of their parents in honor of him. That this was a Ph\u0153nician custom is evident from Philastrius, and Porphyry, and Eusebius too, as I have already shewn when treating on the subject of the Druids. It obtained particularly in the land of Canaan and the Mediterranean Syria, in which Ph\u0153 nicia was comprehended ; and the author of the book of wisdom, as well as Jeremy and Ezekiel, seem severally to allude to the prevalence of the practice in Syria of immolating their children.

Of the Carthaginians, who were a colony of the Syrians, Ennius says, they practised \" that custom of sacrificing their little children to the Gods.\" Fescenius Festus relates that the Car- thaginians were wont to immolate human victims to Saturn.* They who had no children, used to buy them from the poor to offer them in sacrifice, as Plutarch informs us. Diodorus relates an instance of this more than savage bar barity, which is sufficient to fill any mind with horror. He tells us, that when Agathocles was going to besiege Carthage, the people, seeing the extremity to which they were reduced, imputed all their misfortunes to the anger of their god Saturn, because that, instead of offering up to him children nobly born,"], [317, "281 I should wish -in my zeal for the fair character of Ireland,\u2014 I could have access to proofs, whereby to shew that its early inhabitants,\u2014 on accepting from the Ph\u0153nicians, like the Spaniards, the worship of Moloch, Astarte, and Baal, as also of Hercules,\u2014 had nobly rejected,\u2014 at least one, the most unhallowed, the most unnatural feature in their superstition,\u2014 human immolation.

Doctors Hunter and Todd have practised those horrid rites. They were indulged in only by the Fir Bolgs, who were Celts, and who contrived the cromleachs for the occasion.

I incline more, however, to the opinion of Todd, who endeavours to prove from this altar, that the Ph\u0153nicians made use of the letters of the Greek alphabet after their arrival in Greece, as the Cartha ginians did those of the Latin language, which they had borrowed from the Romans. This latter cir cumstance Aurelius Victor appears to allude to, when, speaking of Septimius Severus, he says, \" he was versed in all the literature of the Latins, and spoke the Punic language with ease ; the more so, no doubt, as being born in Leptis, in the province of Africa.\" Which custom we may conclude had flourished amongst the Carthaginians in the time of Plautus,* from a Carthaginian fragment inserted in Valiancy, a name never to be mentioned with disrespect, encountered much ridicule, in consequeuce of his having traced Irish in the Carthaginian's speech, in a play of Plautus.

And Cook is convinced that the name of the town of Hartlepole on the Durham coast, is a manifest de pravation of the word Heracleopolis. To me, too, it appears exceedingly probable that the great western promontory of Airchil, with the islands of the same name, were the promontory of Hercules, as denominated by the Ph\u0153nicians ; and whether the town of, Errigall, in each of the two counties of Monaghan and Londonderry, may not also be some vestige of Hercules' name, I leave to the decision of more competent judges. The worship of this deity, it is certain that the Irish, as well as the Spaniards, had borrowed from the Ph\u0153nicians ; for they alone had erected temples and altars to the Tyrian Hercules as their national hero; it being under his conduct, \u2014 whom some describe as contemporary with Moses, \u2014 that the Ph\u0153nician tribes had sailed to Gades. Whence, after his death, they built a temple at this place in honor of him, which was deemed illustrious for its religion, its antiquity, and its wealth ; and if at a loss to know ruption from its original name, Herculis promontorium, which it obtained from the celebrated navigator, the Tyrian Hercules, known in our annals by the designation of Phenius."], [323, "287 why it was particularly sacred, Pomponius Mela ex plains : \" because that it contained Hercules's bones.\" There were no statues in this temple, according to Philostratus, but only two brazen altars without an image. We have a verse of Silius Italicus to the same effect, which may be thus translated : \u2014 \" In it were seen no sacred effigies, Nor well-known likeness of their deities conformably, as would appear, to the worship in which Hercules had instructed them. Bochart, how ever, thinks that it was from the Jews the Ph\u0153nicians had adopted the practice of not worshipping images in this temple ; or, perhaps, from the patriarchal re ligion, which did not recognise images. For Cornelius Tacitus declares, that the Hebrews thought it im pious in any one to represent the deity by any statue or likeness, and consequently ridiculed the Assyrians, as Macrobius asserts, for their habitual worship of the sun and moon. Plutarch tells us, that Lycurgus's doctrine corresponded in this particular with the Hebrews ; and though the Scythians, the Persians, and the Lybians, not only differed, but were directly opposed to one another in their respective creeds, in one point, however, they harmonised completely, and that was \u2014 the invisibility of the godhead. The Romans, likewise, some time subsequent, and more especially in the reign of Numa Pompilius, adhering to the authority of Moses, Pythagoras, Socrates, and"], [324, "288 Lycurgus, continued to adore their gods without statues for a period of upwards of one hundred and seventy years. The ancient Germans did the same, as appears from the testimony of Cornelius Tacitus. But Hercules might have learned this system of religion in Arabia, whence some antiquarians suppose that he was descended. For the Arabian* idols con sisted, in a great measure, of huge rough stones, which the posterity of Ismael had taught them to worship, and upon which they used to pour oil and wine, in imitation of Jacob, who poured oil upon the stone which served him as a pillow at the time of his vision.f Afterwards, however, they practised their * The Arabians were the descendants of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, by his concubine Hagar ; and they are, in some re spects, even to this day, the most remarkable people in the world. The angel told Hagar that her son should be a wild man, and the Arabians remain uncivilized even to this hour. His hand was to be against every man, and every man's hand against him ; and so it is even now, for the Arabians live by plundering, not only such as travel from this part of the world, but even the Turks themselves, who pretend to be their masters. He was to live in the midst of his brethren ; and it is very re markable, that the Arabians were never yet conquered. In vain did the great monarchs of the east attempt to subdue them, they still remain what they were three thousand years ago. t Eastern travellers, in modern times, have been known to do the same; the night air is not generally injurious in the East as it is with us. We are not to suppose that Jacob laid his bare head on the bare stone; a cap or turban probably guarded the one, and a portion of his long garments or perhaps a wallet, formed a covering for the other."], [325, "289 adorations upon those very stones, which it is very probable that the Ph\u0153nicians did also originally; although, in process of time, before the people of Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they betook themselves to the worship of graven images. Where fore the Lord had commanded his people, before ever they arrived at the promised land, to overturn their altars, demolish their statues, and cut down their groves. Strabo relates in what spot of the island of Gades, and on what occasion, the Ph\u0153nicians had erected that temple, as advised by the oracle. Appian and Arrian, both, assert that Hercules was worshipped therein, after the Ph\u0153nician manner, as we have said, with religious solemnities and magnificent sacrifices ; whilst we have loads of monuments as well in Asia as in Europe, to prove that the custom was thence transferred, and by the same people, to their different colonies, where they erected altars and shrines for its celebration. Of this number, it may suffice to remind the reader, only, of the altars erected on the Alps, of which Petronius says, \" On the aerial Alps, \u2014 where lofty cliffs ascend under a Grecian name, and suffer themselves to be sur mounted, \u2014 lies a spot consecrated to the Herculean altars \" From Hercules, its founder, did the ancients give the name of Heraclea to the Ph\u0153nician city Seta bim, in the province of the Edetani, in Spain; as also to another Ph\u0153nician city in B\u0153tica, at the u"], [326, "290 foot of mount Calpe. For as in Greek, Heracleia \u2014 with an acute accent over its penultimate \u2014 means, in the general, anything belonging to Hercules, so the same word, with a circumflex \u2014 thus, Heracleia \u2014 over the same syllable, means, sacred rites or sacrifices de- dicated to Hercules ; and in either sense are to be found several cities of this name, in various parts of the East. From Hercules, too, it is probable that the Ph\u0153nician settlers in Spain, gave the name of Eriguela, as it is now called with some slight varia- tion from the original, to a village of the Artabri ; as, also, to Arcalis and Argolell, villages of the Iler- getes ; Arcal and Argalo, towns of the Suevi, near Compostella ; Arquillo, amongst the Numantines ; Argull, Arcallana, and Arguiello, amongst the As- tures. Wherefore, I should hope it will not seem over-absurd if I should trace, in this country also, some vestiges of the name Hercules \u2014 in that of Arklow, a town in the county Wicklow, near the vale of Ovoca, where are to be seen, at this day, the remains of an ancient camp ; and in Errigol-Keeroge, a little town in the barony of Clogher, county Tyrone: for as Keeroge would seem derived from the Ph\u0153ni cian, Kerag, a census or cess ; or Kerac, a citadel or fortress, we may easily understand by the name of this town, either \" the fortress of Hercules,\" or tri butary to the worship of Hercules.* * In every stage of society men naturally love the marvellous ; but in the early stages, a certain portion of it is necessary to"], [327, "291 I should wish to give a whet to the investigating talent of the learned sons of Ireland, to ascertain whether Iffa and Offa, the name of a barony in the county Tipperary, province of Munster, may not be a vestige of the worship of Iphis, that we may be able thence to infer whether or not the Ph\u0153nicians had imported it among us. For some Spaniards are very positive, that from Iphis, was given the name of Iphae, to a rock of a conical form, and miraculous elevation, without the slightest support on either side, lying on the Mediterranean coast, between Alona and Dianium. Although others derive it from the Ph\u0153nician word Ipha, handsome ; and others, again, from the Celtic If-ach, meaning standing alone, or unsupported. As to Iphis itself, some Syriac make any narration sufficiently interesting to attract attention, or obtain an audience : whence the actions of gods are inter mixed with those of men in the earliest traditions or histories of all nations ; and poetical fable occupied the place of his torical truth in their accounts of the transactions of war and policy, as well as in those of the revolutions of nature and origin of things. Each had produced some renowned warriors, whose mighty achievements had been assisted by the favor, or obstructed by the anger, of the gods ; and each had some popular tales concerning the means, by which those gods had constructed the universe, and the principles, upon which they continued to govern it: whence the Greeks and Romans found a Hercules in every country which they visited, as well as in their own ; and the adventures of some such hero supply the first materials for history, as a cosmogony or theogony exhibits the first system of philosophy, in every nation. u 2"], [328, "292 antiquarians suppose it to be a corrupted name from Jepthis, that is, the daughter of Jephtha, and so called after him ; from the union of which name with, anassa, which, in the Greek, means, queen, was made up the name of Iphianassa ; as from its union with genia, which signifies descended from, arose Iphige nia. Wherefore, also, the daughter of Jephtha had a place amongst the deities of the Ph\u0153nicians, having divine honors paid to her by the inhabitants of Sa maria, who celebrated an annual festival in her honour \u2014 as we learn from Epiphanius \u2014 the origin of which we will see accounted for in the book of Judges. From the story of Jephthah, who devoted his only daughter in fulfilment of his vow to God, Homer took occasion in his fable of Agamemnon to make him sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia, with all suit able solemnities. Memnon, too, who had been slain by Achilles, after he had come an auxiliary to Priam in the Trojan war, is a farther instance, having been wept* for, after his death, and worshipped by the As syrians as a distinguished scion of Aurora \u2014 as Oppi an relates \u2014 with a temple, also, built in Egypt, to * Sunt lachrym\u00e6 rerum et mentem mortalia a tangunt. \u2014 This reminds me of the philosophic tears of Xerxes, at the contem plated mortality of his innumerable army ; and as I happen to light upon an unpublished poem \u2014 written by a young officer of the artillery corps, merely as a school exercise during his pre paratory education \u2014 I feel happy at the opportunity of inserting"], [329, "293 his honour by the inhabitants of Thebes.

From the Cabiri, Seward thinks is derived, Cab ragh, or Cabaragh, the name of a very ancient Irish town situated formerly near Dublin Castle, but now so in corporated with this Metropolis of the kingdom, that its very limits cannot be pointed out. The name Cabiri itself, he conceives consonant with the Irish word Cabhar, a prop or buttress ; or rather, I take it, with Cabhaire, one who props, a supporter. These deities, he says, the Corybantes invoked, who were the sacrificing priests of Ireland as they were of the Greeks too, on sudden and unexpected emergencies. Whence he supposes it likely, that the above men tioned term of Cabaragh was so called as containing within it, or as being itself a seminary of, the Cory bantes. \u2014 From the same source would he derive the name of the district of Cabragh, or Cabra, near"], [332, "296 Rathfriland, in the county Down ; to which we may add Cabra-castle, near Kills, in the county Meath. The Spanish towns of Cabeiro and Cabeiros amongst the Suevi, in the canton of Toledo, savor strongly of the same superstition ; which would rather seem de rived from Cabir\u00e6, or Cabiria, the sacred rites of the Cabiri ; just as the district of Asia Minor, where they were worshipped, was called after them Cabira. Pausanias, too, assures us that a district of Perga mus was called by the name of Cabiris. Some of the ancients have supposed that the name of the Cabiri was borrowed from that of a mountain in Phrygia, called Cabirus, where they were worshipped with religious solemnities. But the reverse is more likely to have been the fact, and that the mountain was so called after them. They were themselves ancient divinities, belonging to the Ph\u0153nicians, which they designated as, Cabirin, that is, great or potent, from the singular, Cabir, which, by the addition of, a, and the expunction of, c \u2014 which to them is only an adverb of similitude \u2014 becomes abir, that is, strong, or preeminent in fortitude. This word \u2014 originally, truly applied to God \u2014 the Syrians transferred to Ceres, Pluto, and Proserpine \u2014 by some called Axieros,Axicersus, and Axicersa \u2014 whose father too they state to have been Vulcan. Therefore it was, perhaps, that in some coins, these deities were re presented undor the appearance of a man holding in his right hand a mallet, and in his left an anvil."], [333, "297 Some would have them to be Jupiter, Bacchus, and Ceres ; others, Osiris, Orus, and Isis * Julius Fir micus, in his \" Errors of profane religions\" says,, that the Cabiri were three brothers, the eldest of whom having been slain by the two others, was enrolled amongst the Gods, and worshipped by the Thessa lonians. But this I look upon as foreign from the truth, and merely a fiction of the poets. For the worship of the Cabiri had its origin in Ph\u0153nicia, whence it passed over to the islands of the \u00c6gean sea, and more especially to Samothrace and the Imbri, where their religion was flourishingly esta blished, until, at length, it made way to Athens and * These were the general gods of Egypt, and such as were worshipped by the king, aud his courtiers; for almost every district had its particular deity ; Some worshipped dogs; others oxen ; some hawks ; some owls ; some crocodiles ; some cats ; and others ibis, a sort of an Egyptian stork. The worship of these animals was confined to certain places ; and it often happened, that those who adored the crocodile, were ridiculed by such as paid divine honours to the cat. To support the honor of their different idols, bloody wars often took place ; and whole provinces were depopulated to decide the question \u2014 whether a crocodile or a cat was a god ? It does not, however, appear that, these people were idolators, in the strict sense of the word, although it is more than pro bable, that, in many instances, they deviated from the worship of the true god, according to its original purity. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, calls the God of Abraham, Jehovah aud Elohim, both of which are the highest titles that can be as cribed to the Divine Being, because they include all his incon ceivable attributes."], [334, "298 the other cities of Greece, with Spain and all the other colonies which the Ph\u0153nicians had planted. There are those, too, who add a third to their num ber, namely, Kadmus, or Kasmilus, or Kadmilus, whom many suppose to have been the same as Her mes, or Mercury ; for by Varro's testimony, in the Samothracian mysteries, Kasmilus is the name given to a certain officer or attendant upon the sacred rites offered to the great gods, that is, the Cabiri. The natives of the island of Lesbos, also, worshipped him under the name of Kadmus, or Kadmilus, which, by the way, they borrowed from the Ph\u0153nicians, in whose language cadmi, means a harbinger : and cadmilac, a forerunner of some news or message. Therefore, also, it was that Mercury was called Her mes, from the Greek word signifying an interpreter, or messenger \u2014 which was his province amongst the heavenly inhabitants ; and they who conceive his real name to be originally Celtic, derive it from the words, mere, traffic, and ur, a man ; which emi nently accords with the Ph\u0153nician word Cnani, or Canani, which signifies not only a Canaanite, or na tive of the land of Canaan, but also a merchant or trafficer, the inhabitants of that country having been ever intent upon trade, in the furtherance of which, with a view to the improvement of their for tunes, they spent their whole life and energies. These four Cabiri were worshipped in some shrines as the gods of the deceased ; Ceres, who was also"], [335, "299 called Cabiria, as the earth that sustains them ; Pluto and Proserpine as a symbol of hell, wherein they re side ; and Mercury, as their leader and conductor. A great portion of the leading men of that age used to visit the celebrated temple of the Cabiri, in Samothrace, to be initiated in their mysteries. This journey was undertaken by the heroes of the Trojan* * Sir Isaac Newton brings the \u00e6ra of the destruction of Troy about three hundred years lower down than any other chronologist had done before, fixing it to the 78th year after the death of Solomon, the year before our vulgar \u00e6ra 904; \u2014 and the year of Dido's building Carthage, to the year 883, i. e. 21 years after, when \u00c6neas might very well be alive. Those who will take the trouble to examine his book, will find it no easy matter to withstand the weighty reasons he offers in support of his singular opinion. To shorten the reader's labour, I shall briefly mention a few of them. 1. He observes that Virgil agrees with the Arundel marbles. As Tirgil relates, probably from the archives of Tyre or Cy prus, that Teucer came from the war of Troy to Cyprus in the days of queen Dido (see \u00c6n. I. 623.) and with his father seized Cyprus; so the Arundel Marbles say that Teucer came to Cyprus seven years after the destruction of Troy, and built Salamis. 2. In the temple built at Cadiz to Hercules, under the name of Melcartus, was Teucer's golden belt, beside Pygmalion's golden bow, by which it appears, that the temple was built in their days, and that they were contemporary. 3. Dionysius Halicarnasseus reckons sixteen kings from La tinus, who reigned in Italy in the time of the Trojan war, to Romulus ; and from him to the consuls were six kings more : which twenty two reigns, at a medium of eighteen years to a reign (taking the lowest reckoning, because many of them died violent deaths), amount to 396 years. These, counted back-"], [336, "300 war, by Philip of Macedon, and others \u2014 not solely because of the protection and support which they had promised themselves from those deities against dan gers and accidents, and more especially storms, but be cause of the respect which ever attached to any indivi duals who happened to have the honor of initiation in those solemnities. Heathen writers have omitted all allusion to those mysteries, f either from ward from the consuls Brutus and Publicola, place the Trojan war about seventy-eight years after the death of Solomon, according to Sir Isaac's first computation. 4. Herodotus, who says Homer and Hesiod, were but 400 years before him, wrote in the time of Nehemiah, i. e. 444 years before Christ. And Hesiod said he was but an age after the destruction of Troy. Now 400, 444, and 60 years more for the time between Hesiod and the war of Troy, bring it to the year before Christ 904, as Sir Isaac reckons. 5. Lastly, in the year 1689, the cardinal points had gone back one full sign, six degrees, twenty-nine minutes, from the cardinal points of Chiron (in the time of the Argonautic expe dition) as nearly, he says, as can be determined from the coarse observations of the ancients. Consequently, at the rate of seventy-two years to a degree, 2627 years had then passed since Chiron, which brings us back to the forty-three years after the death of Solomon, for the time of the Argonautic expedition ; and the destruction of Troy was about thirty or thirty-five years later. So that all these collateral proofs agree in one point, and fix the \u00e6ra of the ruin of Troy about one and the same year, viz. 904 years before our vulgar \u00e6ra. * There never was any one religion whatsoever, that had not a particular set of mysteries, which none but a few select devotees could ever attain to. In order to arrive at that pitch of perfection, there have always been such extravagant cere-"], [337, "301 some groundless veneration which they thought silence would encourage; or, what appears more cer tain, from the obscenities of conduct with which they were but too grossly defiled, and to which even the high priests themselves would be ashamed to give utterance. Therefore it was, probably, that during their celebration they made use of a peculiar dialect, unintelligible to the vulgar; which Cam byses very humorously upbraids them with, at the doors of those deities, as Herodotus informs us. Some people confound the Curetes, or Corybantes, with those Cabiri, whilst others think it more pro bable that they were their sacrificing priests, and more especially of Ceres, Cibele, or Rhea, whose agonising spirit and disconsolate heart for the dis astrous loss of her darling Atys, those ministers af fected to represent in their devotions, rending the air with the most hideous yells, adding thereto the confused conceit of timbrels and brazen cymbals, running about all the while, and shaking their heads from one side to the other ; in short, exhibiting every symptom and gesticulation that madness could suggest.

Others think the name derived from corns, a helmet ; others from, corutto, to butt with the horn, or toss the head ; others from, crubo, or crubazo, to conceal, as they assisted Rhea in doing with respect to her offspring ; others from, crouo, to beat, or make a noise, at which they excelled \u2014 clashing instrument against instru ment, and metal against metal, bearing the brunt of all upon their sonorous shields, and seasoning the whole with their \" most sweet\" voices.* But in as much as these all, coming from a Grecian source, are disapproved of by some people \u2014 as too far fetched, injudicious, and at variance with one another, \u2014 they look upon it as more to the purpose, what Diodorus Siculus asserts, namely, that the Corybantes were so called from Corybas, the son of Cybele, by Jasion ; or from another of the same name, who con veyed into Phrygia the sacred rites of the mother of the gods, and named the directors of her religious ceremonies after himself. But Corybas, the son of Cybele, belongs to mythology; and as it appears from other sources, that the names of Cybele and the Cabiri took theirs from Ph\u0153nicia, I consider the same may be said of the Corybantes, who were the officiating ministers of the Cabiri ; for in the Ph\u0153- Such is the origin of drums, and although they make at present a distinguishing figure in our armies, yet they were no more, originally, than implements of idolatry and superstition."], [339, "303 nician language, Corban, or Coriban, means a gift or offering presented either to God, to idols, or to men ; as it does also, the treasury, or the coffer, in which such presents were deposited ; and idolators took occasion subsequently to transfer the name to their shrines or chapels ; and, as the superintendants of such shrines had the charge and custody of all donations consigned to them, they thence, naturally, were denominated Corybantes. Or they may have assumed to themselves the name from, Coribin, mean ing kinsfolks, kindred, or relatives, with a view to conciliate the affections of the populace from the fa miliarity of its tone. The geography of Spain appears still to retain some vestiges of the names of Corybas and Cory bantes in that of Corbate, a town situated in the province of the Vaccei ; Caravainos, Caravion, and Caravanzo, amongst the Assures ; Corbite, Curbian, and Curantes, in the district of the Suevi.

To me, at least, it is extremely probable, that, the ancient city of Camala amongst the Astures in Spain, was so named from the Ph\u0153nician worship of Ca milus, or Kadmilus ; though others consider it a Grecian name, from, Kemelaia, a little olive tree \u2014 to which I must add the names of, Cameles and Cama leno, towns of the Astures ; Camellera, a village of the Ilergites, and Comillas, a maritime town of Can tabria."], [341, "305 CHAP. XXXIII. Fire worship in Ireland\u2014 By whom introduced\u2014 Ur a city of the Chaldeans, why so culled\u2014 Called also Camerina, and why \u2014 Vestiges of these names in the geography of Spain \u2014 The religion of fire transferred from the Ph\u0153nicians to other nations\u2014 The Estia of the Greeks, and Vesta of the Romans. That the ancient Irish were worshippers of fire is a point upon which the antiquarians of the country are all unanimous. \u2014 But whether they derived the superstition from the authority of the Celts or Ph\u0153- nicians, is what has not yet been determined, though closely contested by the partisans of either side. I think, however, the controversy admits of a very easy solution, if we but attend to the rise and pro- gress of the worship itself, as well as the names of certain localities in this island, which are considered to bear a direct reference to it. The first, then, who, according to Vossius, ordered fire to be worshipped as a deity, was Nimrod,* whom * Or rather, in whom they considered the Belus, or Sun, to be personified. He resided for some time at Babylon, but X"], [342, "306 the Gentiles called, Belus, that is, master or lord. From this circumstance, Ur, a city of the Chaldeans, in which sacrifices used to have been performed to fire, obtained its name, as it did also those of Urge, Urie, and Camarina ; for, ur, or, or, means a flame or blaze of fire, or the hearth wherein it blazes ; camar, as before observed, to burn ; cuma rin, idol priests, and cumarith, the office of priest hood. But as from, Urge and Ur, I conceive were named those very ancient Ph\u0153nician cities of Spain, called Urci and Urgellum ; as well as that extensive and flourishing district in Ireland, which formerly constituted a dynasty in itself, and comprehends within its compass the modern counties of Louth, Armagh, and Moneghan, I mean Orgeal. \u2014 And as from Camarina, I imagine, were denominated Cama- rena and Camarenilla, towns of the Carpenti ; with an Camorina \u2014 both town and river \u2014 of the Suevi, near Nineveh was the grand seat of his empire. This city was built on the eastern banks of the river Tigris, and was one of the largest ever known in the world. It was about sixty miles in circumference ; Me walls were one hundred feet high, and so broad, that chariots could pass each other upon them. They, were furthermore, adorned with fifteen hundred towers, and each of these two hundred feet high ; which, may, in some measure, account for what we read in the book of Jonah, that Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days journey. Her lofty towers shone like meridian beams, And asa world within herself she seems."], [343, "307 Compostella ; in all of which fire worship was insti tuted by their several founders.\u2014 So from the plural, Urin, signifying, hearths, or fires lighted, do I think it exceedingly probable that the river Urrin in Ire land, in the county of Wexford, and barony of Scarewalsh, had been denominated. Again the town of Uregare, in the barony of Coshma, and county Limerick, is obviously compounded of, ur-egar, mean ing, a shrine dedicated to fire ; or else, of, ur-egur, an altar consecrated to the same. Urglin, too, the name of a village in the barony of Catherlough, county Carlow, is made up of the words ur-glin, a manifestation, or revelation of fire ; or, ur-galglin, fire in a round heap of stones ; for, glin, in the Syriac, means heaps of stones, as well as it did, a manifest ation ; and galglin, rotundities, or roundnesses. It is not improbable but that there might have been erected there some one of those round towers so frequent in this kingdom. St. Jerome makes mention of this fire worship amongst the Chaldeans, whose whole country, from the same circumstance, was called, Orkoe The Persians too, had their, ur ; and it is well known that they held fire in great veneration, having first only worshipped it as a symbol of the deity, but this figurative worship gradually passed into actual and downright homage, until, in the progress of time, as Lucian observes, they were content with no less than offering sacrifices to it. x 2"], [344, "308 The same is asserted by the ancients of the Medes. from whom this superstition was transferred to the Syrians, and from them again to other nations inha biting Asia ; nay, to the Cauromatians, Macedonians, and Cappadocians, whose Magi were called \" Purai thoi,\" that is, fire kindlers, and their temples \" Pu raitheia, that is, places wherein fire is kindled, which latter, we may add, consisted of \" immense inclosures in the centre of which was erected an altar, where the magi used to preserve a heap of ashes, besides the ever burning fire,\" resembling, as D' Alton affirms,* our * Yes, but Mr. D'Alton, and Mr. Higgins, (Celtic Druids,) and all the other fire votaries, should know that those fire tem ples of the Ghebres, were nothing more than, what Dr. Hurd, an ocular witness, has \"appropriately styled them, viz. \"sorry huts,\" \u2014 the ancient ones, being, according to Sir John Malcolm, arched vaults about fifteen feet high ; and the modern ones, ac cording to Captain Keppel, without any covering at all ! Han way, who appears to have misled all our fire speculators, fell into a similar mistake, himself, with respect to the \" Round Towers,\" or Budhist Temples, which he met with in the east \u2014 calling them, \"fire temples.\"\u2014 Yet, by and by, when he has occasion to describe an actual fire temple, he represents it as a vault, not exceeding, in height, ten or fifteen feet, of which, by the way, we have several still in Ireland, before hinted at in an early note in this volume, and distinct altogether from the \" Round Towers,\" which are specimens of the finest architecture extant in any country. In 1820, Henry de Loundres, archbishop of Dublin, put out this fire, called \" unextinguishable,\" \u2014 which had been preserved, though a remnant of the pagan idolatry of Baal \u2014 from the earliest times, by the nuns of St. Brigid, at Kildare. It was re-lighted, and continued to burn until the"], [345, "309 Irish f Round Towers,\"* as well as the \" Atush kudu,\" or fire chapels, which Zoroaster had ordered to be total suppression of monasteries; the ruins of the fire-house and nunnery still remain, and bear no relation to the \" Round Towers.\" Here was Dr. Villanueva's greatest mistake. * As the benefit of light is best known when contrasted with darkness, so truth is the more admired for being compared with falsehood. On this principle it was that the early missionaries of the Christian church have proceeded in Ireland. Finding, on their arrival, a hallowed regard attached to those localities, whereon stood the memorials of previous Pagan adoration, the best use, they conceived they could make of this \" regard,\" was, to erect, on the same \" localities,\" Christian houses of worship; to, at once, conciliate the prejudices of those whom they would fain persuade, and divert their adoration from the creature to the Creator. We observe, accordingly, mouldering in decay, beside eacA of the three species of ancient Irish worship, the Celtic, the Budhist, and the Druidical \u2014 the first and last of which be came ultimately identified, and of which the Cromleachs and Mithratic caves are the memorials ; while the \" Round Towers\" represent the purer, the bloodless, and the inoffensive Budhist faith \u2014 Christian ruins of more modern structures, yet venerable in antiquity, and composed by architects who could not vie in skill, of either design or cement, with their pagan predecessors. And yet upon this single circumstance of contiguity to Ec clesiastical dilapidations \u2014 coupled with the bas-relief of a cru cifix which presents itself over the door of the Budhist temple at Donoghmore in Ireland, and that at Brechiu in Scotland \u2014 have the deniers of the antiquity of those venerable edifices, raised that superstructure of historical imposture, which, I pro mise them, will soon crumble around their ears, before the indignant effulgence of regenerated veracity. It might be suf ficient for this purpose to tell them that they might as well, from this vicinity, infer that the Cromleachs were also erected"], [346, "310 erected. These ancient temples of Cybele or Vesta, wherein was preserved the perpetual fire, were by the early nrissionaries, as they would fain make out, by precisely the same mode of inference that the Budhist temples, or Round Towers, had been ! But this would not suit. They could find no ascription associated with Christianity, to which to assign the Cromleachs ; \u2014 and thus have the poor missiona ries escaped the cumbrous imputation of having those colossal pagan slabs affiliated upon them. Not so fortunate the towers. After ransacking the whole catalogue of available applications, appertaining to the order of monastic institutions, with which to sin mi se those temples, the Royal Irish Academy have at last hit upon the noble and dig nified department of a \u2014 dungeon keep ! or, lock up ! \u2014 as the sole use and purpose of their costly erection !

Yet, neither in the Monasteries, nor in any other Christian struc ture, do we meet with those materials above described, either generally or partially ; except where the ruins of a neighbouring \" Round Tower\" have made them available \u2014 which, in itself, is sufficient to overthrow, for ever, the anachronisms of those who would deny the existence of the Round Towers anterior to the Christian \u00e6ra."], [347, "311 called by the Irish, Tlachgo, which some would de rive from the Irish word, tlacht, the earth, the world.

No such thing. \u2014 Hand tali auxilio, nee defensoribus istis tempus eget. The genuineness of this emblem and of the other signs which accompany it, is at once the triumph of my truth and my discovery. Do I mean to say that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ can bear any relation to the doctrine of Budhism? That is the question which ignorance will ask. But our Saviour was not the only one who was cru cified for his faith. In my work upon the \" Round Towers,\" 1 have shewn that Budha, in whose honor those temples were constructed \u2014 was crucified also, in sustainment of a religion the very counterpart of Christianity, differing from it only in pri ority of date. \u2014 And I have given, at the same time, an effigy of this idol, representing his godship in this attitude of cruci fixion ; which, with two other effigies, all representatives of Budha \u2014 in different bearings of his incarnation \u2014 have been dug up in the bogs of Ireland, and reserved for me to develope and elucidate.

See Collect, de Reb. Ibern. p. 308. From the Greeks, the prac tice of worshipping fire passed to the Romans, who worshipped it under the name of Vesta ; for it is past dispute that by Vesta, or the Grecian Estia, was meant not only Cybele, but also a public hearth, or fire place. But as all sacred names have been de rived from the east, so were Estia and Vesta, from, It will readily be believed, therefore, that my indignation and my disgust were, in no small degree, excited, on reading an article in the \" Dublin Penny Journal,\" written by Mr. Petrie, representative of the antiquarian literature ? of the Royal Irish Academy \u2014 in which, having never once dreamt of Budha or his crucifixion - he iynorantly attempts \u2014 but with a confidence which, in my ears, sounded as blasphemy \u2014 to identify the above image with that of our saviour Christ !

Upon which Tullius says, \"ves tal virgins guard in the city the eternal fire of the public hearth.\" Besides the name of Urrin, Uregare, and Urglin, there occur others in the topography of Ireland which evidently borrowed their origin from this wor ship of fire ; Delgany for instance, or, Delgueny, as it is otherwise called, being the name of a village in the county Wicklow, Baxter conceives denominated from delgue, or delga, an old British word, signify ing an idol or image ; whence the Delgovicia of An toninus, the modern Wighton, he looks upon as equi valent to \"the sacred image ;\" \u2014 for there was a cele brated temple belonging to some idol in a certain village thence called Godmundam, that is, the divine mouth. But to my mind, Delgany is a Ph\u0153nician name derived from, delkin, which means a burning fire, the root of which is, deleche, blazed or burned. From this worship also, would seem to be derived the name of the ancient district of Duleek, which at present forms both a barony and borough town in the county Meath ; for, in the Syriac language, du leek, signifies an immense fire. Thus in the Syriac"], [350, "314 version of the gospel according to St. John, verse 35, it is said, \"he was (dulek) a burning light.\" From the same root was named the Ph\u0153nician town of Delica, amongst the Cantabrians in Spain. Aire-Caldachiaroc, the name of a district in the county Tyrone, seems to me to be compounded of the Ph\u0153nician words, hair, he kindled a blazing fire ; Caildai, a Chaldean ; and, chiric, an enclosed place, or chirac, a citadel ; intimating altogether, a fortified place, where the Chald\u00e6ans \u2014 the name by which the Ph\u0153nicians designated all magicians and soothsayers\u2014 used to worship the sacred fire. Ac cording to the testimony of Strabo, as we have j ust before observed, the fire temples consisted of immense enclosures, in the centre of which, upon an altar, was preserved the perennial hearth. From the word, hair, too, which indicates the worship of fire, it is pro bable that the Ph\u0153nicians had designated the town of Airoa, in the county of the province of the Bri gantes in Spain; as also that of Aireje, Aireja, Airesa, and Aireche amongst the Lucanians, who were also a colony of the Ph\u0153nicians."], [351, "315 CHAP.

Some of those places begin with the singular Bal or Bel, and Bally or Baily : others by the plural Balin and Ballin, or Ballim, There are, I know, those who derive all these from the Irish, ball or bail, a place, coast, or margin ; or from, balla, a wall or fortification.

But though my intention is to shew this more fully in my forth coming work on the Ph\u0153nician Geography of Ire land, I flatter myself that my learned readers will not think I trespass upon them too much, if, in the interim, I give them a few as a specimen. Baillie Boroug, a town in the county Cavan, pro vince of Ulster, beside a fort of the same name. Very probably, this may come from the Irish words, baill, grateful, delightful, pleasant ; and borg, a dis strict or village, corresponding to the Teutonic borough ; or from the Ph\u0153nician words, ballei, ancient; or ballia, the same in the feminine; and barg, a tower; or barga, a villa, a hut, which were in use amongst the ancient Persians and Chald\u00e6ans; but now they are not read of but amongst the Arabian writers. Yet I look upon it as more likely, that, Boroug, is a corruption of the Ph\u0153nician word, borac, implying genuflexion, from barac, he bent upon his knees ; and that Baillie, too, emanates from Baal, under whose veil the Ph\u0153nicians worshipped several idols, of which we will discuss a little more diffusely when oppor tunity shall offer, because that very many of our Irish towns and little villages have been denominated after them. The Sidonian Belus, the Phegorian Belus, and the Babylonian Belus, were almost the same in reality as the Jupiter Olympius, Jupiter Latiaris, Jupiter"], [353, "317 Cretensis ; or the Apollo Clarius, Apollo Delphicus, Apollo Selinnutius, &c. &c* The word Bel, omitting the letter, a, after the manner of the Chaldeans, was peculiar to them and the Babylonians. Thence the Greeks and the Latins indiscriminately call the Ph\u0153nician Baal, Bel \u2014 utterly regardless of Eastern dialects. Perhaps the temple of Belus, the Babylonian, was the \"great house,\" which Periegetes mentions, that Semiramis erected to Belus in the Babylonian citadel. Bel was wor shipped from the earliest times at Edessa, a city of the Ph\u0153nicians ; as was also Mercury, whom they name Monimus; and Mars, whom they name Azizius, * The primitive religion of the Greeks, like that of al! other nations not enlightened by Revelation, appears to have been elementary, and to have consisted in an indistinct worship of the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, and the waters, or rather of the spirits supposed to preside over those bodies, and to direct their motions and regulate their modes of existence. Every river, spring, or mountain, had its local genius or peculiar deity ; and as men naturally endeavour to obtain the favor of their gods by such means, as they feel best adapted to win their own, the first worship consisted in offering to them certain portions of whatever they held to be most valuable. At the same time that the regular motions of the heavenly bodies, the stated re turns of summer and winter, of day and night, with all the admirable order of the universe, taught them to believe in the existence and agency of such superior powers ; the irregular and destructive efforts of nature, such as lightning and tempests, inundations and earthquakes, persuaded them that these mighty beings had passions and affections similar to their own, and only differed in possessing greater strength, power, and intelligence."], [354, "318 as you may see in a hymn to the sun, composed by Julian the Apostate, who acknowledges that the sentiment and the information here alluded to, was de- rived from Jamblicus the Syrian, who had been once his preceptor. As bearing reference to this Ph\u0153nician Belus, it is that we are to understand what is said in the II. Kings, xvi. 31, 32, where King Achab in compliment to his father-in-law, Ithoboal, King of the Sidonians, is recorded as having consecrated a temple to Baal in Samaria, called Beth Baal, that is the shrine or chapel of Baal. But the Syrians have handed down from age to age, that this Belus, who was called the Jupiter Thalasius, or Marine Jupiter of the Sidonians, and who, Hesychius mentions, had been worshipped in Sidon : \u2014 the Syrians, I say, have a tradition that he had descended from this latter place, which was a maritime and flourishing com mercial city of Ph\u0153nicia. The Europeans called Belus by the names of Zeus* and Jupiter, as applied to whom we are to receive that sentence in the first * As the maintenance of order and subordination among men required the authority of a supreme magistrate, the continuation and general predominance of order and regularity in the universe would naturally suggest the idea of a supreme God, to whose soverign control all the rest were subject; and this ineffable personage the primitive Greeks appear to have called by a name expressive of the sentiment, which the contemplation of his great characteristic attribute naturally inspired, Deus, signify ing, according to the most probable etymology, reverential fear or awe. Their poets, however, soon debased his dignity, and"], [355, "319 \u00c6neid, where it is said, that \" he filled with wine a goblet, which Belus and all descended from Belus, were accustomed to fill ;\" for the Carthaginians had sprung from Ph\u0153nicia, and the poet is here speaking of the libation of Dido, their queen. Stephanus also relates, that there was a temple in honour of the Carthaginian Belus or Baal, in Balis, a city of Lybia. Bel, in its diminution from Belin, meant, with the Celts, Sol or Apollo; which they borrowed from the Ph\u0153nicians, the authors of this superstition, and to whom Baal, Beal or Bel expressed the sun, which they originally worshipped with human sacrifices, as we have mentioned, afterwards substituting the brute creation. Hence the first day of May, in Irish, was called La Baal teinne, that is, the day of the fire of Baal ; and several of our Irish mountains still retain the name of Cnocgreine, that is, mountain of the sun ; in numbers of which you may yet see the ruins of heathenish altars and chapels; for the sun is sup posed to have been called Grian, Gren-ur, or Gren-or, in Irish, from the circumstance of the worship paid thereto ; which accords with the Grynean Apollo of Homer, and Gryn\u00e6us, a town of Asia Minor, where, as Strabo asserts, is a temple, and an oracle, and a grove sacred to Apollo, and celebrated for their an- made him the subject of as many wild and extravagant fables as any of his subject progeny ; which fables became a part of their religion, though never seriously believed by any but the lowest of the vulgar."], [356, "320 tiquity, together with their other attributes. To these we may add the river Granicus, as called also from the sun, since its source lay in mount Ida, which was sacred to Apollo, and where the Idean stone was preserved, upon which Homer asserts that Hector was in the habit of sacrificing. From the same worship of the sun was named Grange, a con secrated mountain near Drogheda, formerly Tredagh, which is a town in the county Louth, where O'Conor testifies is to be found a circle of immense stones,* * This extraordinary monument or pyramid, or rather sub- terraneous temple, which is now but a ruin of what it originally was, covers two acres of ground, and has an elevation of about seventy feet ; but its original height was not less than one hundred. It is formed of small stones, covered over with earth; and at its base was encircled by a line of stones, of enormous magnitude, placed in erect positions, and varying in height, from four to eleven feet above the ground, and supposed to weigh from ten to twelve tons each. Of these stones, ten only remained about fifty years back ; and one has since been re- moved. About a century ago, there was also a large pillar stone, or stele., on the summit of the mount, now also destroyed. These stones, as well as those of which the grand interior chamber is built, are not found in the neighbourhood of the pyramid, but have been brought hither from the mouth of ill river Boyne \u2014 a distance of seven or eight miles. The stones of which the entire structure consists, are of great size : those which form the lintels or roof of the gallery, are but six in number; and, of these, the first is twelve feet four inches long, the third eighteen feet, and the fifth about twelve feet ; the breadth of these stones is not less than six feet. The tallest of the upright ones forming the entrance to the recess, is seven feet six inches in height, and its companion seven feet. The"], [357, "321 and other vestiges of idolatry, of wonderful magni tude, as appears, also, in the descriptions of Llhuydh and Pownall. These and other such vestiges of the sacrificing priests, are even at this day called Leab thacha na bh Feine, or the monuments of the Ph\u0153 nicians. From the sun's worship, too, it would seem that Greenfield, which is situated by the banks of the Blackwater, in the county Cork, had obtained its name ; as well as Green-Island, which lies in Dona- ghadee harbour, in the county Down ; Green-Mount, a town in the county Louth ; Green-Hills, which are the summits of certain mountains in the county Kildare. But we should observe, that hill, which with us means a mountain, meant with the Ph\u0153ni- cians, an idol, and was spelled with one, I. The Irish word Grian or Green, too, \u2014 the sun, \u2014 is derived from the Ph\u0153nician Krew, the sun's ray or splendour. Hence the Irish call the zodiac or sun's revolution, by the name of Grean bheach ; and a sun dial, by vase or urn within this chamber, is three feet eight inches in diameter ; that in the opposite chamber is displaced from its supporter : these urns are of granite. On the first examination of the interior, a pyramidial or obeliscal stone, six or seven feet in height, is said to have stood in the centre, near which the skeletons of two human bodies were found ; and about the same period, two gold Roman coins were discovered on the top of the Mount \u2014 the one of the elder Valentinian, and the other of Theodosius. Y"], [358, "322 the name of Grian clog, that is, a solar clock ; to this I refer the names of Cnoc Greine and Tuara Greine, that is, hills of the sun ; very many of which, as the Irish writers attest, were remarkable for idol atrous altars; Aois-Greine, called Cnoc-Greine, from the hill of the sun, lying in the county Limerick, up to the suburbs of the very city. And although Aois may well be derived, as O'Conor imagines, from the Irish word Aos, which signifies a religious sect or society, because there formerly a certain leading sect of the Druids was worshipped, or paid worship them selves ; yet the Irish word, aos, itself, must be derived either from the Ph\u0153nician, aoz,he assembled ; or, aos, he was assembled. Likewise the name of that Druid ical altar, called Granny's* Bed, near Fermoy, in the county Cork, is supposed to have been corrupted from Grean Beacht, which is usually interpreted, the sun's circle. I prefer, however, the word, bed, which is, the Ph\u0153nician, beth, meaning a house, a shrine, a temple. The Ph\u0153nicians named some of the cities of their country from the name of Baal ; for instance, Baal * Caile, or Granny, that#is, \"old hag,\" the name of a giantess, who devoured all the children of the neighbourhood, corresponding with the destructive goddess, Calee, of the Brahmins, whose neck is ornamented with a chain of human skulls, descriptive of the human sacrifices which were annually offered to her in Hindostan."], [359, "323 Meon, mentioned in Numbers xxxii. 38 ; Baal H\u00e6 mon, in Canticles viii. 11 ; Baal Zcphon, in Exodus xiv. 2 : for the story of Aben Ezra is, that this idol was constructed by Pharoah's Magi, in imitation of the position of the heavenly bodies, and placed beside the Arabic Gulph, with a view to observe and retard the Israelites, \u2014 being vested with the power of in veigling them on their march, and diverting their course from their heaven-ordained enterprise. The Ph\u0153nicians, also, gave the name of, Baal Gad, to a part of Mount Lebanus, beginning within the precincts of their own jurisdiction, under Tyre, afterwards called Gibel ; and the plain of Jericho, they called Baal Thamar, as you would say the palm-grove of Baal : for, Jericho, itself, was called Thamar, or the city of palms, from the numerous plantations of this kind with which it was environed and ornamented. Of this Ph\u0153nician custom of consecrating to Baal the names of cities and of people, Spain still retains evi dent proofs, in the names of Balin and Balina, towns belonging to the Astures and the Gallicians ; as it does, also, in Balimana, a village of Celtiberia. Madrid had formerly a gate, opposite to the river Manzanares, named Balnadu, comprising, in its for mation, the Ph\u0153nician, Baalin dub, that is, the river dedicated to Baal; or beside the temple of Baal; which I shall also prove, in its proper place, to be the etymology of Dublin.

Certainly, we may trace it in the final syllable of those ancient and distinguished Carthaginian appel latives \u2014 Annibal, Ardrubal, and Adhubal. The Easterns, too, have very often modelled their names after the same plan, as we may see in the first sylla ble of Beladane; the last of Ethobale; and several others of the same kind.

For as Martin, who is by far the most accurate and most diligent describer of them, has shewn, it is usual amongst them to apply to persons, who happen to stand on the brink of any difficulties, the expressive proverb of their \" standing between the two fires of Belus ;\"\u2014 alluding, of course, to the bloody sacrifices of youths and infants, who, in honor of this idol, as we have often before men tioned, were cruelly burned between two funeral piles. Nay, more, the very word \" funeral pile \" was, by the Anglo-Saxons, called B\u00e6l-fir ; and a priest, by the Aremorici, was designated Belec, as you would a full view of them, from their entering the gate of our street, until they reached our house.

Whence, too, may I ask, comes the Vulcan of the Romans, unless from the Syriac, Bel-canna, which is the Celtic, Belcan, that is, the burning hot Bel or Baal ? Furthermore the Irish, Samhain, or sacred season, appears to me to have originated from, Shamain, which was another name for Baal amongst the Ph\u0153- nicians, in whose language, Shamain, litterally ex- presses, the heavens ; and, by Synechdoche, the god of heaven, or who dwells therein. An/! likewise, in Irish, signifies a planet ; and, samh, the sun ; whence after the manner of the Ph\u0153nicians, who looked upon the sun as the only god in heaven, as Phylo Bybli- ensis, the interpreter of Sanchoniathon mentions, they worshipped this planet under the name of Baal. Respecting which, Augustine, on Judges xvi, says, \" The Carthaginians seem to call Baal, the Lord. Whence they are understood to say, Baal-samen, as if, the lord of heaven \u2014 the heavens with them being called, samen ; \" where instead of, samain, we per- ceive that he uses, samen ; in conformity, perhaps, with the Ph\u0153nician dialect of that age. But this very deity, which the Ph\u0153nicians styled Beal- samen, or lord of heaven, was no other, as Philo re- marks, than the Olympian Jove, or the Jupiter of the Grecians.

To this too, I refer the etymology of Merns, the name of one of the Scotch counties\u2014 one of its most fertile, I may observe, both for tillage and pasture. For what else is it, with a slight alteration, than Marnas, the idol of Gaza, a city of Palestine, by which name the Gazeans affected to worship Baal ; for Mar or Maran, in Syriac, if you look to the ages after the captivity, is interpreted the same as Baal ; hence in the Ph\u0153nician, marnas, or marnasa, means the divinity, or lord of mankind.* When the island of Crete adopted the worship of this idol, he was called by its inhabitants, Jupiter Cretensis ; so that you see the Cretans borrowed their Jupiter from the Ph\u0153 nicians, not the latter from the former. And they transferred their idol Marnas, with their own an cient name into the British isles. The same con jecture gains countenance in Foggart, a town in the county Louth, province of Leinster ; for under this name there seems to lie concealed the idol Fegor, or Baal Fegor, which the Moabites worshipped, and * We read in I. Kings, six. that when Elijah the prophet was called upon, by the \" still small voice,\" in the wilderness, he answered, that he only was left in Israel to worship the true God. But let us remember the reply ; \" I have seven thousand in Israel, who have not bowed the knees unto Baal, and mouths that have not kissed him.\""], [364, "328 which St. Jerome, commenting on a verse in Hosea, affirms \"we may pronounce to have been\" Pri apus. Although others think the name derived from Fegor, a mountain in the country of Moab, opposite the desert of Jesimmon, in which Baal, or as Suidas calls him, Beal, had a temple and religious honors paid him, which may have been the origin, perhaps, of the Irishf words, feighr, a hill, and feigh, bloody, in allusion to the human victims immolated to this idol. Finally, Bel, or Baal, is a name impi ously given to other images also, whether of stars, or of heroes, the memory of which they would far rather cherish, and was to them more dear. But the Baali, here indicated, does not only mean Baal, but, my Baal, or my Lord, which name was originally given to the true God. The Israelites, with propriety and devotion, called God their Baal, before that God himself, from the frequent applica tion of that name to profane divinites, forbad its farther use. That the Ph\u0153nicians had often used Baali for Baal, is evidenced by the very localities and local names of this country, for instance, Ballibofy, Ballyboughan, Ballibrack, Ballibur, Ballicary, Bal tinglas, or Beal-tine-glas, a mountain in the county t Yet the chastity of the women, and the bravery of the men, are traits of the national character on which these people, not without justice, pique themselves. \u2014 Pkilos.
