Somewhere on the southern coast of Cornwall there stands the old Castle of Merylin, part of which claims an antiquity reaching back to the times before the Conquest. It belonged, at the period when our story opens, to the last repre sentative of a very ancient family, which, scorn ing to trace its lineage from either Norman or Saxon robbers, boasted the rare distinction of descent from a stock of untainted British blood. The Pendragons of Merylin claimed, in fact, to be descended from King Arthur himself, and would have regarded any doubt cast on the historic character of that hero as something little short of the crime of Use-majesU. It is not our purpose, however, to inflict on our readers any pages from the Pendragon genealogy ; and we shall only A"], [10, "URIEL. 2 communicate so much of the family history as is necessary for the comprehension of our narrative. Sir Michael Pendragon was, as we have said, the last male representative of the family in its direct line, for there was a collateral branch, of which we shall speak presently. A widowed and melancholy man, he lived among his ancestral woods and towers with Aurelia, his only daughter and sole surviving child. He had lost his last son, the pride and joy of his heart, about six years before the commencement of our story, under circumstances which had shed over his life the gloom, not merely of bereavement, but of dis- grace ; and he had, what to him was the additional sorrow of knowing that when he should be laid among the tombs of his ancestors the line of the \" Golden-haired Pendragons,\" as they were called, would be extinct. Their name would only sur- vive in the family of the \" Black Pendragons \" of Eaglehurst, a branch which had forked off from the old stock, at the time of the great Revolution and adopting the cause and religion of the Dutch invader of that .w-glorious period, had continued staunch supporters of the Protestant succession and the Whig policy down to the last general election ; when, to the unspeakable shame and disgust of the master of Merylin, a Black Pen dragon had been returned member for the county in the advanced Liberal interest."], [11, "MERYLIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS. 3 The Golden-haired Pendragons had remained true to the old faith, as they had remained true to the old line of sovereigns so long as it possessed a representative to claim their fidelity. They had been fined as recusants, and had had their lands sequestrated ; they had harboured priests, and con cealed them in hiding-holes ; they had defended their Castle from the Roundheads, and could show the marks on their walls left by the cannon-balls of Cromwell ; in short, they had done all and suffered all that loyal Cavaliers and unflinching Papists could be expecte'd to do and suffer. And stripped as they had been of many a broad acre, they counted it an ample compensation that they still possessed the gray Keep whose history was lost in the mist of the Cornish chronicles, and the castle chapel which had never been profaned, and in which it was said the sanctuary lamp had never been extinguished. That a fair and perhaps more than a fair share of family pride should lurk as a prevailing weakness among the Pendragons of Merylin was hardly surprising. Perhaps it did not with them assume its very narrowest and most repulsive form, for it was blended with a love of nobleness, not of birth alone but of character. But possibly on this very account it was more insidious, and it was cherished by its possessors rather as a virtue than a weakness. The point of honour had come"], [12, "URIEL 4 to be regarded among them with something that must needs be called idolatry ; and truth, courage, and fidelity to be esteemed scarcely so much as the virtues becoming a Christian gentleman, as because they were held to be the hereditary appanage of a Pendragon. If this were so, how ever, the pride had been severely chastised in the present generation ; and those who saw Sir Michael Pendragon, with his bowed head and snowy hair, well knew that he had been smitten down less by an accumulation of temporal losses than by the blot on his family escutcheon. In his daughter he found whatever earthly solace remained to him. Aurelia lived for her father, and had accepted as her vocation the task of soothing the evening of his sad life ; and though since their troubles they had mixed but little with their country neighbours, yet the white-haired old man and his beautiful daughter were universally regarded with pity and respect. Among these neighbours was one family whose members, from various causes, had come to be admitted to closer intimacy with the inmates of the castle than was enjoyed by others of higher rank than themselves. The Houghtons of Laventor Manor belonged to a modest class of gentry, and made no pretence to anything more distinguished. Geoffrey Houghton, the present squire, could have given a good account of his"], [13, "MERYLIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS. 5 grandfather, and his grandfather's grandfather ; but though the Houghtons could trace back their squiredom through a respectable number of generations, their family connections were to be found among the professional men of the countv, nor is it altogether impossible that some of them may have condescended so far as to have made an honest independence by trade. Geoffrey himself, the best of landlords, the most painstaking of magistrates, the most truthful, upright, honest man in the Royal Duchy, would have been the very last person in the world that any novelist would dream of selecting as a hero. In the first place, he was not a genius. He had had the education of a gentleman, and remembered httle or nothing about it. But to make up for his oblivion of Greek and Latin, he had contrived to acquire a considerable knowledge of business and accounts, managed his own estate, and managed it well ; was master of all kinds of useful practical information, but was wholly incapable of doing or saying a brilliant thing. Even this would, per haps, have been more pardonable in the eyes of the supposed novehst than the fact \u2014 which a sturdy resolve to be truthful compels us not to disguise from our reader \u2014 that Geoffrey Houghton was neither graceful nor handsome in appearance, His figure was fashioned on the thick-set type, and his face \u2014 well, we have no great skill in the"], [14, "URIEL 6 depicting of the faces of young squires, but it was plain, decidedly, and the young ladies of the neighbourhood generally agreed in voting him a \" fright.\" Not that he had squinting eyes, a turned-up nose, or a gaping mouth ; but his features had much the same character of \" thick settedness\" as his limbs, and their plainness was redeemed rather by their honesty than by any remarkable intelligence of expression. Geoffrey Houghton, at the age of thirty, was still unmarried, and found his family circle, which included his mother and two sisters, Mary and Gertrude, both younger than himself, sufficiently bright and happy to prevent his looking beyond it. So, at least, he was accustomed to say when cross-examined on the subject by indiscreet friends; though the giddier of his critics were wont to assert that he remained single because no one in all Cornwall would have him, and Geoffrey himself would have been the last to have demurred to their criticism. He was fully persuaded that an uglier, awkwarder, stupider fellow than himself never existed, and that for him to have aspired to any fair lady's favour would have been at once an absurdity and an impertinence. He took it as part of his allotted destiny in this world that he was to live in it, not to shine, or be admired, or even to be blessed with some special forms of earthly happiness, but to serve God and his"], [15, "MERYLIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS. 7 neighbour, and, to use his favourite phrase, \"to do his best.\" Among those towards whom he \" did his best,\" Sir Michael Pendragon and his daughter were certainly to be numbered. All his good sense and knowledge of business were at the service of the old baronet, who, broken by family sorrows, had suffered his affairs to fall into much confusion. Gradually, however, he had come to give his con fidence to Geoffrey Houghton, and leant on him for guidance in all worldly affairs, and Geoffrey proved himself worthy of the trust reposed in him ; for, at the cost of much time and labour, he had set things on a footing in the Merylin estate, which saved it from the ruin which seemed imminent, and released it from its long arrears of debt. The only other family whose proximity to Mery lin was sufficiently near to entitle them to be re garded as neighbours, was one whose members were comparatively new-comers. Swinburne Park had been purchased about five years previously by a gentleman whose defect of ancestry was abund antly compensated for in the eyes of a good many people by his wealth and his good fortune. The wealth had been acquired by the mercantile success of his father, and increased by his own lucky speculations ; whilst the good fortune was mani fested, not only by the result of these specula-"], [16, "8 URIEL tions, but by the entrance which Mr. Holmes- Abbott had somehow obtained into what is popularly known as \" good society,\" and his further success in winning the hand of Lady Annabel Wyvern, a daughter of the Earl of Snowdon. This alliance, between wealth on the one hand and noble birth and great connections on the other, was thoroughly satisfactory to both parties concerned. Holmes- Abbott was well content to leave in his wife's ex perienced hands the steerage of his domestic bark, and her conduct of the helm proved so judicious that he found himself pleasantly floated into cer tain aristocratic circles whither his unassisted efforts, and even his ample revenue, would not easily have admitted him. So the Hoi mes- Abbotts spent that portion of the year in the metropolis which is due from all personages who, in the judg ment of the world, deserve to be considered as anybody ; and during the wintry months, when they came down to Swinburne, they contrived to make their country residence as little like country seclusion as a succession of entertainments and the reception of distinguished guests could render it. Lady Annabel's ambition was to render it the civilised centre, so to speak, of the neighbourhood. Had the family at Merylin been what it once was, it would probably have claimed, by position in the social scale, to have taken the lead in that section of the Cornish world. As it was, there was no"], [17, "MERYLIN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS. 9 rivalry to be feared from the Pendragons, and the Abbotts of Swinburne Park were generally recog nised as the first people of consequence within a radius of twenty miles. We shall leave our readers to gather for them selves from the course of our narrative any further information they may desire regarding the three families to whom we have briefly introduced them, and beg of them, if they find the present chapter a dull one, to regard it merely as a preface."], [18, "10 CHAPTER II. A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. Whatever is dreary and miserable in the long months of an English winter redeems itself most surely in the evening hour, when, with shutters shut and curtains drawn, a family circle draws round that blazing hearth which may truly be reckoned with pride among our national institu tions. The day may come, and probably will, when the increasing study of domestic economy shall have substituted stoves for our open fire places, but we fear not to state our solemn con viction that when that last reform is consummated, the sun of England's domestic felicity will have set. It was then, round the palladium of a blazing fire, that the family party of Laventor Manor were assembled on the evening of a wintry day, which Geoffrey had spent at the neighbouring county town of Chelston, in the discharge of some of those magisterial and public duties, a punctual fidelity to which was to him a kind of religion. On the present occasion he had been detained"], [19, "A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. 11 longer than usual, and had brought back with him a certain Mr. Rodolph Beresford, a member of one of the neighbouring families, and a rather fre quent visitor at Laventor. Rodolph was a fluent talker, and kept the ball going in most societies of which he formed part \u2014 a quality which made him very generally welcome, though whether the balls he set in motion were of any special weight or value was a question on which two opinions might be entertained. \" How late you were to-day, my dear Geoffrey,\" said his mother ; \" and such a day as it has been ! You must be frightfully tired.\" \" No,\" replied Geoffrey, \" not disagreeably tired, that is. After beating up and down the streets of Chelston for the best part of the day, with the east wind driving the snow in your face, it makes one appreciate one's own fireside.\" \" We should have been back a couple of hours sooner,\" said Rodolph, \"if it hadn't been for Julian Wyvern's last crotchet. He has taken up the reform of our lifeboat service, and is labouring to procure an Act of Parliament to compel all country squires resident within ten miles of the sea-coast to belong to a lifeboat crew.\" \" Not quite that,\" said Geoffrey, \" but he will get something done, I have no doubt. I never knew Julian take up a thing he did not suc ceed in.\""], [20, "URIEL 12 \" Then his successes must be something alarm ing,\" rephed Rodolph, \"for to my certain knowledge he takes up a new hobby once a week.\" \" Is Mr. Wyvern in this part of the world, then ? \" asked Gertrude Houghton. \" I thought he was in America, or the Holy Land, or some where.\" \" How extraordinarily capital ! \" exclaimed Rodolph ; \" a perfect risumi of our friend Julian's manner of life. But no, he really is here in Cornwall, staying at the Park ; Lady Annabel is his cousin, you know, and as, since her brother's death, he is presumptive heir to the earldom, I fancy she thinks it desirable to culti vate him somewhat particularly.\" \" That reminds me,\" said Mary, \" that there is a note for you, Geoffrey, from the Park ; a servant rode over with it, whilst you were out ; it looks wonderfully like a note of invitation.\" Geoffrey groaned as he took in his hand the delicate epistle handed him by his sister, nor did its contents appear to be inspiriting, for having slowly made his way to the bottom of the second page, he handed it to his sister, with a woful ex pression of countenance, ejaculating as he did so, \" Isn't it horrid ? \" \"What is horrid, dear Geff?\" said Gertrude, coming behind her sister, and reading the letter"], [21, "A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. 13 over her shoulder ; \" an invitation to dine and sleep at the Park, to-morrow ? I shouldn't call that horrid at all. You'll have the best of dinners, and the best of society ; what can you desire more ? \" \" Best of dinners, indeed ! \" growled Geoffrey ; \" French kickshaws one don't know the name of, with a flunky grinning at you behind your chair ; and as to society, it's all German counts and Cabinet Ministers. I prefer eating my own mutton among my equals.\" \" Really, Geoffrey,\" said his sister, \" to listen to you one would think you had been brought up among the Ojibeways. Considering the pains Mary bestows upon you, you certainly don't do her credit.\" \" You must always let Geoffrey have his growl out,\" said Rodolph. \" You will see when he has said one or two more spiteful things about the German counts he will resign himself to his fate, and accept her ladyship's hospitality like a true born Briton. Besides, Julian Wyvern's presence will gild the pill.\" \" That is true,\" said Geoffrey ; \" Julian will weigh against a dozen or two of distinguished foreigners, so I suppose I must do it.\" \" Of course,\" said Mary ; \" so proceed to write your acceptance with a good grace.\" She placed the writing materials before him, lingering by his"], [22, "14 URIEL side to superintend the completion of the note, and satisfy herself as to its style and execution. \"Iam glad Mr. Wyvern is in the neighbour hood again,\" said Gertrude ; \" of course he is more or less mad, but of all lunatics the most entertaining.\" \" Mad perhaps is rather too severe a term,\" said Mrs. Houghton ; \" but certainly, if all one hears of Mr. Wyvern is true, he is a little eccentric. Such a pity, with his gifts, too ! I often wonder how it is that, intimate as you are with him, Geoffrey, you don't teach him the necessity of a little practical common sense.\" \" I think Julian just one of the finest fellows going,\" replied Geoffrey, rather testily, as, having brought his note to a happy conclusion, he com mitted the folding of it to Mary's more skilful fingers ; \" put sense into him, indeed ! Why, he has sense enough to fit out a three-decker.\" \" Juhan is your brother's romance ; all the world knows that,\" said Rodolph ; \" every child of Adam has his soft bit, and Geoffrey's poetic fibre is attached to Julian Wyvern's wide awake.\" \" Poetic fiddlesticks ! \" said Geoffrey ; \"he does not make a fool of himself racing, or that sort of thing ; and he has a track of his own, tries to mend things and get to the bottom of things, and so on, that is all I can see about his"], [23, "A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. 15 madness,\" and having thus attempted the defence of his absent friend, with indifferent success so far as the rules of elocution are concerned, he thrust his hands into his pockets, a common but ungraceful habit of his, as though to express \" Those are my sentiments, and I have no more to say.\" \" Now, don't be vexed ; you know I was not aiming at legal precision when I called him mad,\" said Gertrude, \" but you must allow that when locomotives take to having ' tracks of their own,' their proceedings generally end by taking them off the rail.\" \" That's just it,\" said Rodolph, \" no one doubts Wyvern's genius, or his sublime intentions ; but a man who never follows ordinary laws must not take it amiss if his aberrations from the beaten track are puzzling to ordinary minds.\" \" Well, but what has Mr. Wyvern done so very extraordinary ? \" said Mary. \" I really cannot remember.\" \" Oh, everything,\" said Rodolph. \" I don't speak of his conversion ; of course, we think that all right \u2014 though for a lad at Eton to set up for himself, and stick to it in the way he did, took most people by surprise. Then there were two years as Papal Zouave ; perhaps you think that right, too, though it didn't do much in the way of settling his worldly career. When he"], [24, "URIEL. 16 came back from his travels, most persons thought he was going in as a professional artist, when all of a sudden we hear of him down in Staffordshire, among the bargees, attempting, I suppose, to im prove their condition, though he probably did not know a barge from a billiard-table ; and now here he is in Cornwall, setting us to rights with some new invention of a life-boat, which I will lay any wager will upset in the first squall.\" \" It is a pity,\" said Mrs. Houghton, \" for he is so truly good-natured, and every one says has real genius, only so little ballast. It is ' all things by turns and nothing long,' and no good comes of that. He might take example from Geoffrey,\" and she -looked as she spoke at her son, in whom, with a mother's partiality, she beheld no defect, whether mental or physical. Geoffrey's hands were still in his pockets, and unable to meet Rodolph on the fair field of dis cussion, he contented himself with muttering something which sounded much like, \" Take ex ample from fiddlesticks ! \" Mary came to his aid, as she generally did when there was more in her brother's heart or mind than his tongue found skill to utter. \" There are so many ways of putting things,\" she said, gently, \" I suppose one might make any one's life seem ridiculous by stringing things together in tbat way. If Mr. Wyvern goes on a"], [25, "A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. 17 different track from the world at large, perhaps it is a nobler one.\" Rodolph shrugged his shoulders. \" It may be so,\" he said ; \"I confess the common road con tents my vulgar ambition.\" In the portrait of Julian Wyvern which Beres ford had sketched, there was just that amount of truth which is to be found in a caricature ; but, like all caricatures, it possessed no real likeness. Neither was good Mrs. Houghton's appreciation of her son's brilliant friend more correct when she called him \" all things by turns and nothing long.\" Had Julian been questioned, he would, perhaps, have said that he had never followed but one object all his life. Almost from his cradle he had found stamped on his imagination an ideal of what was great and noble, and he sought for its realisation as he grew to manhood, but found it nowhere. Its absence perplexed and for a time saddened him. For what was original in him was not so much the possession of a noble ideal, a thing he held in common with a vast number of persons who in practice never soar above their native littleness \u2014 it was that, far from resting content with the theory of greatness, he was always seeking to carry his theories into action. So soon as he came to understand that the world set itself in the precisely opposite direction, then it became equally clear to him L"], [26, "18 URIEL. that the world and he must part company, and he threw off the bondage of its conventional re strictions with a boldness which in some degree laid him open to the charge of eccentricity. Why it should be considered extravagant or ridiculous to carry principles into practice Julian had no power to comprehend. If St. Martin of Tours were held in veneration for cutting his cloak in half to clothe a beggar in the fifth cen tury, he failed to see why an English gentleman should be held wanting in common sense for taking off his greatcoat, and giving it to a poor man in the street, in the nineteenth. If one of his own ancestors in the twentieth generation had gained the reputation of a hero for taking the cross, why should he be laughed at for join ing the Zouaves ? And if the praises of the Protestant Howard resounded through the world for reforming the prisons of Europe, why should it be thought crotchety for a Catholic layman to see for himself into the state of the Staffordshire bargees ? Why, indeed ! The deductions to which he came on these questions seemed to him self the strictest logic and common sense, while by the greater number of his acquaintance they were adjudged as overstrained and romantic ; and this was the less extraordinary when we consider that he had not yet attained the maturing clim acteric of thirty, and that in the carrying out of"], [27, "A FIRESIDE CONVERSATION. 19 his views he had not always been swayed by the golden rule of discretion. He had his friends, however, as well as his critics, and perhaps in the eyes of the world the most singular feature in the whole matter was the close alliance which existed between himself and Geoffrey Houghton, two men between whom, as these same critics were wont to argue, there existed no single point of common sympathy. But whether the critics were right in this conjecture is a point we shall reserve for the future judgment of our readers."], [28, "20 CHAPTER III. AURELIA. On the following morning Geoffrey announced that his departure would be early, as he had business which would take him to Tremadoc, a viUage on the sea-coast, where it was proposed to experiment on the new life-boat, and that he should proceed thence to Swinburne without re turning home. This arrangement rendered neces sary the leaving of various orders, which were duly received by Mary, who generally acted as her brother's domestic lieutenant ; and she had accompanied him into the hall to take his last directions and witness his departure, when, as the hall-door opened, they perceived approaching, a carriage, which both recognised as the Merylin equipage. It was an unusual apparition, and an unusual time for visitors, and as the solitary occu pant was received at the door by the brother and sister, Mary's exclamation of joyful wonder shall serve as her introduction : \"Is it possible, Aurelia ? \""], [29, "AURELIA. 21 There was no doubt, at any rate, as to the personality of their visitor, whom Mary proceeded, before ushering her into the library, to disen cumber of her furs and winter wraps, displaying as she did so a stately and graceful figure entirely robed in black, for since her brother's death Aurelia Pendragon had never laid aside her mourning. Her beauty, which was undeniable, was accompanied by an air of unconsciousness and indifference to her own exterior such as could hardly escape the notice of a close observer. It almost seemed to betoken that this beauty, or rather, perhaps, the admiration which it was calculated to excite, was a nuisance to its pos sessor instead of being a pride, and that, far from seeking to display it to its best advantage, she would gladly have concealed it had she been able. But such a result would have taxed a greater in genuity than Aurelia dreamt of employing on the matter. We shall not undertake to paint her portrait for the reader's benefit, being of opinion that beauty is indescribable : only one feature we would beg him to remark, and that is, the mass of golden hair which no amount of plaiting and doubling up availed to conceal. It was the hereditary appanage of her race, which marked her at once as a true Pendragon of Merylin. Not that every member of that family was dis tinguished by this peculiar feature ; but from"], [30, "URIEL 22 time to time it reappeared among them, and tradition had come to affirm that those who bore that dazzling badge of the old British royalty were marked by destiny either for great mis fortunes or for an heroic career, possibly even for both. And, in point of fact, the loyal cavalier who had died for his king on the scaffold, and another noble youth who had assumed the priestly character and been hanged at Tyburn, were both known to have been true golden-haired Pendragons. It seemed a sort of outward and visible token of inward greatness of soul, which rose above the common lot of mortals, and led them to a noble, if even, as the world counted it, to an unhappy end. The family misfortunes, and in particular the sorrows of her father, had stamped their own impress on Aurelia's character. Perhaps also the influence of these old traditions had told on her, for it could not be denied that there was a certain exaltation of ideas in the Pendragon race not altogether unallied with superstition. Be that as it may, Aurelia, from her very childhood, had regarded herself as severed from many of the ordinary interests and aspirations of girls of her age and position. The retired life which she led in the old castle had fostered this disposition, and it might truly have been said that Aurelia had grown up neither knowing nor caring for the world. Her very uncommon powers of mind"], [31, "A URELIA. 23 and force of will developed therefore in their own way ; and as her father's broken health and spirits unfitted him more and more from taking any active part in his own affairs, the direction of everything fell into Aurelia's hands. Acting under Geoffrey's advice, she had established good order both in the household and on the estate ; she had in her much of that courage and talent for government which is discernible in the char acteristics of so many noble women of Catholic times, united to a tender charity which made her known in every poor cottage within five miles of the castle. In times of sickness or danger she seemed altogether indifferent to the thought of her own safety, and possibly the feeling to which she had become used, almost unconsciously, that the mark of destiny was on her, had not been without its effect, and Aurelia habitually lived as one devoted. \" I am an early visitor, I know,\" she began, in a tone of apology, as she submitted to Mary's affectionate care. \" But such a rare one,\" interrupted Mary, \" that you would be welcome if you came at cock-crow.\" \" The fact was, I wanted to see Mr. Houghton, and I did not know when I should find him at home if I called at a more reasonable hour,\" said Aurelia."], [32, "URIEL. 24 \" And five minutes later he would have been on the road to Tremadoc,\" said Mary, \"so you see how wise you were to come when you did.\" \" Nothing the matter, I hope ? \" said Geoffrey. \" No, nothing whatever, only poor papa ; \u2014 you know when he has an idea in his head how it takes possession of him. He has been so drooping of late, I was afraid of his getting back into that dreadful despondent way. I turned over so many things, in hopes of rousing him, and at last one day, I think it must have been an in spiration of some good angel, we were talking of the chapel ; you know it is all but a ruin, and I said how I wished we could restore it. He took it up and has been thinking and talking of it ever since ; and I really think if we could set it going, it would be just the sort of interest to prevent his brooding.\" \" No doubt about it,\" said Geoffrey, \" I don't see any objection. There's the money, of course ? \" \" No,\" said Aurelia, smiling, \"-the money would not be any difficulty, for I could undertake all that. You know I have my mother's property ; \u2014 now you are not going to put any obstacles in the way,\" she continued, as Geoffrey stood before the fire, with his hands in his pockets, and a large note of interrogation on his countenance, \" and"], [33, "AURELIA. 25 it was not a Committee on Ways and Means that I wanted. At least, it was Ways, but not Means. What I want to know is, how we are to do it ? \" \" Simple enough,\" said Geoffrey ; \" get an archi tect, have a plan, get an estimate, and so forth, and begin in the spring, I should say.\" \" Oh yes,\" said Aurelia, \" but the case is not by any means as simple as that. You can't ima gine what the chapel is to my father. He spends half the day there, damp as it is. I always tremble lest he should get a chill, and nothing will induce him to have it warmed. If an archi tect takes it in hand, and insists on having his 'own way, I don't know where he would begin or where he would end. And you know if he changed and upset things, papa would think it laying hands on a sacred ark. And they will do what they hke ; \u2014 that is what I am afraid of.\" \" Very true,\" said Geoffrey, \" it's like lawyers : they're all rogues. I mostly do my own buildings on that account \u2014 with a builder, you know. There's Jones of Tremadoc, he's a very honest fellow. Well, we got the mill down there set right, and the granary ; capitally done, and we employed no architect.\" Aurelia smiled again, but before she could reply Mary interposed. \" My dear Geff,\" she said, \" you are the best of mill-builders, and Jones, as all the world knows, is a capital trades-"], [34, "26 URIEL. man, and not a rogue ; but I don't think he would quite do to restore a chapel of the thir teenth century.\" \" I didn't say he would,\" replied Geoffrey, \" but you are always so quick : you don't give one time. What I mean is that architects are great nuisances, and if one can do without them it's much the best.\" \" I am afraid in the present case there will be no hope of doing without one,\" said Aurelia. \" What I wanted you to try and find out for me if you can, is, who would be best ; if there is anywhere such a thing as a man who would con sider papa's wishes and feelings, and do no more than he wished to have done ? I should be in agonies if anybody were to begin upon the mor tuary chapel : yet it is in a dreadful state.\" Geoffrey continued standing as before, and jingling his keys in his pockets, in serious reflec tion. \" Well,\" he said, at last, \" I think I'll ask Julian. You see he knows everybody ; \u2014 I mean artists and so forth. I'm sure if there is a man in all England that would suit you, Julian would know him, and if he doesn't know him, he'll find him. Extraordinary he is for hunting people out, and getting what can't be got elsewhere. Now he got me a plough last year ; I couldn't find it anywhere ; \u2014 the Duneath plough it is ; \u2014 goes by steam. I was sure there was such a"], [35, "A U RE LI A. 27 thing, but no one could tell me the right place. Well, Julian got me the address in a week. In Glasgow it was ; \u2014 most useful contrivance. I'll ask Julian ; \u2014 I shall see him to-night, and we can talk it over, and I'll let you know to-morrow.\" \" Thanks,\" said Aurelia ; \" not that I have any idea who Mr. Julian is ; is he a farmer ? I don't seem to know the name.\" Mary could not contain her amusement. \" A farmer ! My dear Aurelia, Mr. Julian Wyvern is heir presumptive to an earldom, and Geff's dearest friend. You must have heard of him, and his pictures, and his lifeboats, and I don't know what besides ? \" \" How stupid I am,\" said Aurelia ; \" of course I know who Mr. Julian Wyvern is, though I have never seen him, that I know of. He is just the one who could tell us about it. Really, Geof frey,\" she continued, turning to him as she spoke, \" you are everybody's friend. I wonder what we should all do without you. You think of every thing.\" Geoffrey became scarlet to the roots of his hair, and looked more awkward than ever ; but though extremely pleased, was far too shy to enjoy the satisfaction. \" I think if you'll excuse me,\" he said, \" I must be off to Tremadoc ; I was to be there by eleven, you see, and it only wants a quarter.\""], [36, "URIEL 28 \" Then don't stay,\" said Aurelia, \" only let me know as soon as you can what Mr. Wyvern has to suggest.\" Geoffrey took his leave, and Aurelia continued her eulogium of him to his sister. \" I do think he is so good,\" she said ; \" I never yet asked him a thing he has not done or tried to do.\" Mary listened in silent triumph to the praise of her brother. \"It is very good of you to say so,\" she said. \" Everybody knows that Geoffrey is not a genius ; but he works so hard, and does so much : more, I think, than many who make a better show; \u2014 and then he is the best of brothers.\" Aurelia sighed. \" How happy you are,\" she said, \" I don't know what it is, but whenever I come to Laventor it seems to me like something too beautiful to be real \u2014 as though it were a scene in a book.\" Mary laughed heartily. \" To think of your dressing up our poor little Laventor in that style,\" she said, \"just one step above a comfortable farm house ! If I were to speak so of your wonderful castle, there would be some meaning in it. I never enter Merylin, with its tapestry and its armour, and its ancestral pictures, but I ask my self if it is not all an enchanted dream.\" \" And it is just all that which I am so weary of,\" replied Aurelia, \" and which makes me feel"], [37, "AURELIA. 29 as I do when I am here. The flapping tapestry and the weird old pictures are but sad com panions.\" \" You, a Pendragon, to talk so of your ancestors' portraits,\" said Mary. \" It is something like felony.\" \" Perhaps so,\" said Aurelia ; \" but the fine talk about Pendragon ancestry has cost us dear. What I love at Laventor is the bright home atmosphere, like one's nursery days grown up.\" \"Well, I know what you mean,\" said Mary, \" though I should never have thought of your putting it in comparison with the grandeur of Merylin. We have kept our happy childish days longer than most family circles, I think. But it is all Geoffrey ; \u2014 it is indeed. He is a home in himself. He is not clever or handsome, and he can't talk ; and often when he tries, he makes a sad mess of it. And he is awkward, I know, though he can show dignity when he forgets to be shy. But what he is in the house no one can imagine : always kind to mamma, and an angelic temper ; \u2014 a little gruff sometimes, but just like clockwork for regularity. I wonder sometimes if it will always go on so ; \u2014 I suppose it can't ; \u2014 but, as you say, we are a happy family.\" The tears came into poor Aureha's eyes, and Mary wished she had chosen any other subject. \" No,\" said Aurelia, \" that is the sad thing"], [38, "URIEL. 30 with family happiness. It is so beautiful ; \u2014 but it can't go on. A death or a marriage, and the whole thing is changed.\" \" Well, dear Geff will never turn Benedick, I think,\" said Mary. \"But you and Gertrude might leave him,\" said Aurelia. \" I hear Gertrude and Mr. Beres ford are supposed to understand one another. Perhaps it is only gossip.\" \" Oh, I don't know that it will come to that,\" said Mary. \" He's here now, and Gertrude likes him, certainly. I don't. There's no harm in him, you know ; I have nothing to say against him. But it wouldn't make me happy. He talks, if you like ; but it is all /. Old Geoffrey is worth a hundred of him, with all his blunders. Whatever Gertrude does, Geff and I shall keep together, and take care of one another. That's our dream.\" Their dreams and their talk were interrupted by the entrance of other members of the family, including Mr. Beresford, who had excused him self from accompanying Geoffrey to Tremadoc on the plea of having pledged himself to escort Miss Gertrude Houghton somewhere ; for, as Aurelia had hinted, they were on terms of mutual under standing. Gertrude agreed in the general opinion of South Cornwall, wherein Mr. Rodolph Beres ford was regarded as a \" most superior person.\""], [39, "AURELIA. 31 Perhaps South Cornwall was right, and Mary was inappreciative. Certainly, Rodolph shared in the sentiments of his admiring friends, and would have considered it an excellent joke to have been told that any man, and yet more any woman, could have dreamt of putting Geoffrey Houghton in the balance against him. It was extremely gratifying to him to find Miss Pendragon in the drawing-room ; for the Pen dragons were people of consideration, and mixed so little in general society, that to be able to tell his friends he had spent a morning with the beautiful Aurelia would be something worth saying. He therefore laid himself out for being brilliant and amusing, and would probably have succeeded in winning the applause of a large majority of ladies, whether young or old, by his small talk, his droll way of telling nothings, and his sarcastic skill in hitting off the weaknesses or absurdities of everybody of whom he spoke. But Aurelia was not captivated, or rather, to tell the truth, she was excessively weary, and took an early opportunity of making her escape. She had ordered the carriage not to wait, and was going to walk home. \" In the snow ! \u2014 and alone ! \u2014 impossible ! \" said Rodolph ; \" would she allow him to accompany her as far as the castle lodge ? \" Resistance and expostulation were in vain ; and Aurelia, once more enveloped in her"], [40, "URIEL. 32 furs, found herself most politely escorted home wards by her talkative companion. \" Most fortunate I resisted our friend Geoffrey's powers of seduction,\" said Rodolph, battling with the acknowledged difficulties of holding an um brella over the lady at his side. \" Imagine trying a lifeboat in such weather as this ! \" \" Is that what he has gone to Tremadoc for ? \" said Aurelia. \" I am so glad something is being done about the lifeboats. I did not know Mr. Houghton had taken them up.\" \" Well, you know what an excellent fellow he is, though as simple as a child. I suppose he understands as much about lifeboats as I do of upholstery ; but he goes in for it as a duty he owes to society ; just like his magistrate's work \u2014 solemn duty. Nothing comes of it, you know, but the satisfaction to his own mind. If the dear fellow could learn to put two words together, it would be a great providence. When his sister Mary is at his back, she prompts him ; but if he tries to express his sentiments without her at his elbow, as he did yesterday at the meeting, the effect is peculiar.\" No doubt Mr. Rodolph Beresford had no inten tion of being ill-natured. He was only obeying his instincts of hitting off the droll side of everybody. Geoffrey did do his work rather solemnly, it is true ; and his style of speaking was, as has been said,"], [41, "AURELIA. 33 fragmentary and imperfect, but he was no simple ton ; and if the amount of real business done by him at the meeting alluded to had been set side by side with that effected by Rodolph, glibly as the latter had spoken, the balance would have gone against him. Of this Aurelia felt an in stinctive assurance. \" I have the greatest regard for Mr. Houghton,\" she said, \" he has been every thing to my father.\" \" Oh, he is thoroughly worthy,\" said Rodolph, \" only not so fortunate as to have had a fairy godmother to look after his personal charms, ' and so forth,' to use his own expression.\" \" What a hateful man ! \" thought Aurelia, as they reached the Merylin Lodge at last, and he had bowed his leave-taking. \" What can Ger trude see in him to admire ! \" Then she laughed at her own vehemence. \" Just like everybody, I suppose, everybody but Geoffrey ; \" and then she laughed again to think what Rodolph's surprise would have been, could he have heard her com ments, or have guessed it possible that the dis tinguished lady from whom he had just parted could be serious in preferring to his amusing and good-looking self, the stupid, awkward, ugly Geoffrey Houghton.

Whom can we put to sit next him at dinner ?

His taste for associates is, as Rodolph Beresford said the other day, somewhat eclectic.\" \" Well, anyhow, on the present occasion, it may enable poor Mr. Houghton to pass muster to-night,\" said Eugenia. \" Even Tony Lumpkin himself might be tolerated if introduced by the bearer of sixteen quarterings.\" \" I hope the sixteen quarterings will teach him good manners, then,\" said Mabel ; \" but really,"], [44, "URIEL. 36 mamma, if he is not their bailiff, what has Mr. Houghton to do with the Merylin family ? \" \" It is a long story,\" replied Lady Annabel, \" and I never heard it very correctly. It all took place before we came to Swinburne : dreadful family troubles which almost turned the old man's brain, and threw them quite out of society ; and Mr. Houghton acted as their friend, I believe, and took care of the estate.\" \" I have often wondered why they kept so completely out of everything,\" said Mabel. \" Is it a romance, do you suppose ? It would be charm ing to make Tony Lumpkin relate it.\" \" Something for you to try your hand on, this evening,\" said Eugenia ; \"it will be grand to watch your tete-ci-tete together in a conversa tional corner. I shall keep at a discreet distance when I see you fairly launched on the legend of Merylin.\" \" How did Cousin Julian come to make his acquaintance ? \" said Mabel : \" that is another point I have never understood.\" \" It was after he returned from abroad,\" said Lady Annabel. \" He came down to Cornwall on a painting tour, caught a chill, and was laid up with fever in the little inn at Tremadoc.

It was just the sort of adventure to suit Julian's taste ; and, good simpleton that he is, Mr. Houghton never found out he had been entertaining an earl's grandson, till after he had returned to London.

We must claim the privilege of a story-teller to pass over some intervening hours, and pray to be excused from chronicling too exactly the open ing of that evening's entertainment at Swinburne, the progress of the dinner, or the relative position of the guests. They were a mixed assortment, some being of that distinguished character anti cipated in Geoffrey's forebodings, and others neigh bours and acquaintances, invited, like himself, to sun themselves for awhile in the superior atmos phere thus provided for their benefit and edification. There were also members of the family ; sons gathered in from various professional outposts, with gentlemen friends invited with a view to pheasant shooting ; and there was Holmes- Abbott himself, a good-natured, bald-headed man, who gave a cheery welcome to all his guests, the selection of whom he left entirely in the hands of his better-half.

During the previous course of the evening two games of skill had been in progress : the efforts of Mabel Abbott to attack Mr. Houghton and amuse herself at his expense had been so far successfully parried by Eugenia ; and Lady Annabel's attempts at introducing her cousin, Julian Wyvern, to her guests in the position of a lion, had proved equally abortive, owing to the obstinate resistance of that eccentric gentleman to assume the character chosen for him. He would neither talk politics with Count Gleichen, the German ambassador, nor \u00e6sthetics with Mr. Paxton, the popular poet of the day. He might have been wholly uninterested in the existence of lifeboats, to judge from the poverty of his remarks when that subject was introduced, and he was at this moment concealed in a corner at a safe dis tance from all celebrities, and engaged with old Miss Abbott, Holmes- Abbott's venerable aunt, in a discussion on the relative merits, as parlour pets, of pug-dogs, or terriers.

But in this he was mistaken; Mabel Abbott had watched her oppor tunity, and seeing a flank position left unguarded, she advanced promptly and filled the vacant place. \"I am so glad to see you among us again, Mr. Houghton,\" she said ; \" I have been longing for the opportunity of asking you a thousand questions.\" \" Indeed ! \" said Geoffrey, with more surprise than pleasure at the prospect of such a cross examination. \" On what subject can I be so fortunate as to give you any information ? \" \" On a hundred, at least,\" replied Mabel. \" It has only been within the last day or two that I knew what wonderful chapters of our family history you had been mixed up in \u2014 your first acquaintance with Cousin Julian, for instance, under his romantic disguise, and the commence ment of your disinterested friendship.\" Geoffrey's gray eyes surveyed the speaker with a puzzled expression. \" Do you know,\" he said, \" I have not a notion what you mean ? \" \" Haven't you ? \" responded Mabel, who was bent on rallying him. \" The wandering artist found dying at a village inn by the master of Laventor, and supposed by him to be one of the family of Brown, Jones, or Robinson ; carried at once to the Manor House, and charitably tended,"], [49, "SWINBURNE PARK. 41 and discovered on his departure to be an earl's grandson in disguise : I assure you, in the hands of Mr. Paxton, yonder, it would work up into a new idyl. Shall I ask him to try ? \" \"Ah, I see,\" said Geoffrey; \"you are think ing of Julian Wyvern's first appearance in these parts ; but it strikes me some one has been play ing a joke upon you. He wasn't in disguise, and he didn't give his name as Robinson. I found him at the inn, certainly, and drove him to La ventor in the dos;-cart.\" \" Now you are talking of me,\" said a voice over Mabel's shoulder, and the next minute Julian himself had taken a seat beside them. \" Are you conscious, my dear cousin, of the peculiar shiver which, waking or sleeping, betokens that some one is making use of your name ? I felt it on the ottoman there, and resolved on discovering the centre whence issued the magnetic influence, and my infallible instinct guided me hither.\" \" Yes,\" said Mabel, \" we were talking of the interesting commencement of your friendship with Mr. Houghton. He was going to tell me all about it, and had got as far as the dog-cart.\" \" And he was trying to persuade you that I was not in disguise,\" said Julian, who had heard more of the previous conversation than Mabel guessed, \" like a true friend endeavouring to con ceal my youthful follies. But I will be candid"], [50, "URIEL. 42 to you and confess that, when first discovered, I wore pink hose and a Spanish hat and feather, and that the name by which I was known at ' The Three Jolly Fiddlers ' was Timothy Jenkins.\" Mabel began to feel an uncomfortable suspicion that Julian had joined them for the purpose of shielding his friend from the shafts of her ridicule, and perhaps discharging at her some of his own ; and that the process by which he proposed to do so was a little innocent cramming of herself. She had only recently made anything like close acquaintance with this ph\u0153nix of a cousin ; and had not yet been able to determine when he was in jest and when in earnest ; so she prudently resolved to change the subject. \" Well, but your rescue from ' The Three Jolly Fiddlers,' with or without the pink hose, was not the only subject on which I wanted Mr. Houghton to enlighten me. They tell me he is the only man in all Cornwall who knows the secrets of Merylin Castle : can't you persuade him to reveal them, Cousin Julian ? \u2014 we should hsten with rapt attention.\" \" Merylin Castle has no secrets, that I know of,\" rephed Geoffrey. \" It's a queer old place. Mr. Lindesay can tell you more about it than I can : I beheve he is writing its history ; \" and as he spoke he looked in the direction of a gentle man in a clerical garb, who was engaging the"], [51, "SWINBURNE PARK. 43 great poet in conversation within earshot of their group. \" A skilful movement that,\" thought Julian. \" I had no notion old Geoffrey could be so deep ; I must follow up his lead,\" and emerging from the obscurity in which he had hitherto chosen to keep himself, he approached Mr. Lindesay, and warned him that his services as a story-teller were put in requisition, and that there was a universal demand on the part of the company for one of his most romantic legends. Mr. Lindesay was the Rector of Tremadoc, and devoted the intervals of his professional duties to antiquarian researches into the history of his own parish. The opportunity of producing some of the results before an appreciative audience was far from disagreeable to him, though, like some lady singers, he made a show of wanting to be pressed. But having once thrown himself into the general current, Julian soon succeeded in directing it as he wished. It needed but a judicious word or two from him to persuade everybody that a Cor nish legend related round the blazing fire was just the very entertainment they had all been longing for. It was a charming proposal, Lady Annabel declared ; and in five minutes the circle of listeners had drawn in their chairs, and a well-selected post had been assigned to the story-teller."], [52, "URIEL. 44 \" But what is my story to be about ? \" asked Mr. Lindesay, \" ghosts, pixies, giants, or wreckers? \u2014 we have specimens of all sorts in these Cornish wilds.\" \" About Merylin Castle,\" said Mabel, \" if I am to decide the point. Mr. Houghton assures me you are writing its history and know all its secrets, and can tell us if it is true that a tame dragon is still kept in the castle dungeons.\" \" Ah ! Merylin,\" said the rector, passing his hand over his chin, as though rubbing up his memory : \" it has its legends, certainly, and I hardly know where to begin. Perhaps you never heard of the family prophecy ? It is a strange story, and the strangest part is that there is every reason to believe it true. I will call it ' The For tune of Caradoc' \" \" Now, this is famous,\" said Julian ; \"just let us throw a log on the fire, to guard against the necessity of an interruption, and then we will lend you our ears ; \" and suiting the action to the word, he took his seat by Geoffrey, whispering as he did so, \" Safe, till bed-time ! \""], [53, "45 CHAPTER V. THE FORTUNE OF CARADOC. \"I SUPPOSE you all know that Merylin Castle dates back from a remote antiquity, and that the Pendragon family can boast of royal British blood. In what precise degree of kindred they may stand to the renowned King Arthur would puzzle more learned genealogists than I am to determine : all that is necessary for you and me to know to-night is, that their British descent is as undoubted as its exact origin is obscure. I do not know if the fact is to be reckoned as their privilege or their misfortune \u2014 something, probably, of both. It has generated and kept alive among them a peculiar form of family pride, of which there are the most grotesque examples on record. No Pendragon has ever been known to appear at an English court, and I believe until a comparatively recent period certain forms were observed by their own servants and retainers, when in attendance on the head of the family, required only in a royal pre sence. Time was when they even refused to take"], [54, "46 URIEL the oaths like other liege subjects, and claimed as their peculiar privilege to be sworn only ' on the faith of a Pendragon.' These and a thousand other extravagant things are related as belonging to old times, when Cornwall was a world by itself, cut off from the rest of the island by difficulty of communication ; and in those days, I fancy, the inhabitants of the country, for twenty miles round Tremadoc, cared more for the Pendragons of Merylin than for any of the sovereigns that were crowned at Westminster, whatever were their race or name. So, you see, family pride came to be a sort of inheritance among them, and they stuck to it as they would have done to their coat-of arms. How they managed with their consciences I don't exactly know, but they seem to have re garded it as something very like a virtue. \" I daresay some of the present company who know our wild country may be acquainted with the steep road, scarcely more than a bridle path, that winds along the edge of the cliff from Tre madoc to the platform above, on which the castle stands. A better and safer road has been cut of late years, and the old path is seldom used ; but those who have explored it will remember a stone cross which stands at one spot, just on the verge of a giddy precipice, which among the country folk still goes by the name of ' The Fortune of Caradoc' \""], [55, "THE FORTUNE OF CARADOC. 47 \" I remember it well,\" said Julian ; \" it was sketching that cross, in the face of a north-east wind, which nearly finished me off at ' The Three Jolly Fiddlers.' \" \" Oh,\" said Mr. Lindesay, \" I remember the in cident. And probably if you had taken counsel with the hostess of that excellent establishment, she would have warned you to avoid the spot as an uncanny one for man or beast. It bears an ill name in these parts, for that cross marks the spot where Sir Caradoc Pendragon, whom his neigh bours and tenants were wont to call Sir Caradoc the Wicked, met with the judgment of heaven on his crimes. This Sir Caradoc held rule at Merylin in the reign of Charles II. His uncle Sir Arthur, a cavalier of the fine old stock, defended his castle against Cromwell's bull-dogs, and afterwards died on the scaffold for his king. At the Restoration, of course the loyal Pendragons were in great favour and got back all their sequestrated estates ; but unhappily, as was the case with so many other noble families, the successor of the gallant and chivalrous cavalier was a spendthrift and a profligate, and Merylin became the scene of wild revelling and disgraceful disorders of every kind. Even this, perhaps, was not the worst : up to that time the Pendragons, with all their faults, had been the fathers of the people \u2014 open-handed and hospitable to rich and poor, and as princely"], [56, "48 URIEL in their almsgiving as in their bearing. But the mad extravagance of Sir Caradoc drove him to every kind of unworthy straits. The money which he gambled away with his boon companions was wrung out of the very hearts of his tenants ; it was nothing to him what they suffered, pro vided they furnished him with the means for carry ing: on his shameful course. He is even said to have made sport of their troubles by riding with horse and hound through their standing corn ; and when one man, bolder than his fellows, dared to face him and reproach him for his misdeeds, he swore at him as a base-born peasant, and ordered his huntsmen to set the dogs on his track. \" One day, as Sir Caradoc was returning with a party of his companions from the hunt, there rose up suddenly before his horse's head the figure of a tall, gaunt woman, who seemed to have been watching for him by the wayside ; one well known in the neighbourhood as a half-crazed fish wife, whose wretched hovel was perched on the cliff above Tremadoc Alice Spier-the-Span, as she was called, was dreaded by young and old, and her words were universally held to carry a ban with them when she foretold any evil. No one would put to sea if Alice had been heard to threaten foul weather ; and it was commonly said that she had been seen in more than one spot on our terrible coast where mischief was brewing, at"], [57, "THE FORTUNE OF CARADOC. 49 times when she was known by her neighbours to have been within the walls of her own hovel at Tremadoc. Her appearance, however, caused no dismay to Sir Caradoc, though for the moment it startled his horse, and checked his progress, ' Out of my road, old witch ! ' he exclaimed, ' or I may chance to give you a taste of my whip-thong. Let go the horse's head, I tell you,' he continued, as Alice, without heeding his words, grasped at his rein ; ' would you have me ride over your miser able carcass ? ' \" ' Thou hast done worse than that ere now, Caradoc the Wicked,' she replied, ' and I come to warn thee that the time of vengeance is at hand. Thou hast trampled on the poor, and hast mocked at his woes ; ay, and thou hast set thy dogs to hunt him over thy lands. But look well, Sir Caradoc, to your own gate \u2014 the proud big gate of Merylin. Look at it well, and read your doom ; for the rede that is written there shall surely be accomplished.' \" Sir Caradoc scarcely heeded her words, though he was stung to fury at her insolence. He spurred his horse with the intent of riding her down, but the old woman only laughed at his rage ; and as she quitted his bridle rein, and the foaming animal plunged onwards, Sir Caradoc still caught the words ; ' Ride on, Caradoc the Wicked ! ride on to your own gate, and read the doom of heaven ! ' D"], [58, "50 URIEL \" Sir Caradoc was not the first of the party to reach the gates of Merylin : his passage with Alice Spier-the-Span had delayed him some minutes, and several of his retainers and comrades in the hunt had reached home before him. But none had entered ; and as Sir Caradoc rode up he saw them gathered around the great oaken gate, which opens into the courtyard, as though something un usual were the matter. Riding into the midst of the group, he bade them throw open the gates to admit his train ; but as he did so, his eye rested on a strange object, which had evidently arrested the notice of the others, and which sent a cold thrill through his heart. It was a parchment scroll, fastened to the outer gate by a dagger, which was stuck deep into the wood, and which seemed to recall the words of the old fishwife. He bade them pluck it out and bring him the scroll ; but no hand was stirred to obey his bidding. Then he rode up himself, and with a bold, strong hand, he grasped the dagger and tore it from the wood, and the deep rent it left behind may be seen to this day. Then taking the scroll he beheld written, in strange but legible characters, the following words : ' Fortune shall fail the Dragon's race, Till, fall'n its heir by fell disgrace, Angel by name, with angel face, A peasant born shall fill his place.'"], [59, "THE FORTUNE OF CARADOC. 51 \" He laughed a laugh of scorn at the words, which were unintelligible enough, and clear only in containing a prophecy of misfortune ; and swore a terrible oath that the morrow's sun should not set ere in reward for the old witch's evil spell he would burn her hut over her head. \" And he meant in earnest the words he had spoken : for next day, assembling his men at the foot of the cliff on which Alice's strange abode was perched, he bade them scale the rocks and fire the witch's hovel, whether she were in it or no. But not a man would obey his commands ; whatever their fear of their lawless master's wrath, their dread of Alice Spier-the-Span was greater. Cursing them for a pack of faint-hearted cowards, Sir Caradoc seized a torch, and spurred his horse up the rocky path of which I have told you, with the purpose of himself setting fire to the dry thatched roof; but as he reached a sharp turn just below the house there appeared on the rock above him the form of the old woman, who with outstretched arms and streaming hair called aloud, in her shrill and awful accents : ' Ride on, Cara doc the Wicked ! ride on and meet your doom,' and startled by the sudden apparition, the horse swerved aside, reared, and the next moment fell backwards over the precipice, carrying with him his unhappy rider, whose body was literally dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks below. The spot"], [60, "URIEL 52 has ever since been shunned as one of evil repute, and the stone cross that marks the scene of the disaster still bears the name of ' The Fortune of Caradoc' \" \" A famous story,\" said Mr. Paxton, who had been scribbling some lines in his note-book as Lindesay was speaking ; \" and capitally told, too, only it wants some explanatory notes. How about the old dame's prophecy ? I have jotted it down here, and I think, like the handwriting on the wall, it wants an interpreter.\" \" From that day,\" said Mr. Lindesay, \" the good fortune of the Pendragons began to fail. They lost lands, they lost wealth ; again and again the direct heir has failed, and, as in poor Sir Michael's case, the hopes of the family have been blasted. There are still indeed Golden haired Pendragons of Merylin, but they promise fair to become extinct \u2014 at least in the old line \u2014 and when the present baronet dies his lands and his honours will pass to the Pendragons of Eagle hurst \u2014 a very remote and obscure branch of the family. It really seems to be true that since the death of Sir Caradoc in the way I have described, ' Fortune has failed the Dragon's race.' \" \" Yes, but that does not explain the prophecy by any means,\" persisted Paxton ; \" this is a prophecy of misfortune and of restoration, as it"], [61, "THE FORTUNE OF CARADOC. 53 seems to me. Put into plain English, I read it to mean, ' The good fortune of the Pendragons shall fail until the heir shall fall into some terrible disgrace, and his place shall be filled by one of peasant birth.' But that until clearly points to a change for the better.\" \" But who ever dreams of putting prophecies into plain English ? \" said Mabel, \" or trying to get any sense out of them ? \" \" I beg your pardon, young lady,\" said Paxton, looking at her out of his great bush of black hair and beard, \" but there must be sense in anything that is worth listening to ; so we must try to get at what is hidden away in this.\" Mr. Paxton was much too great a man not to be humoured, as both Mabel and Mr. Lindesay were aware. \" The way I have always heard the prophecy explained,\" said the latter gentleman, \" is simply this : that from the time of Caradoc the Wicked the good fortune of the Pendragons began to fail ; that he, the heir of Merylin, came to his end by a disgraceful fall ; and that he was succeeded by his younger brother, Michael, who was born when their father was hiding away as a fugitive from the Roundheads, disguised in a peasant's hut, and who, of course, bore the angel's name.\" Paxton shook his head. \" A very sorry inter pretation, indeed,\" he said. \" If this were so, the"], [62, "URIEL 54 fortune of the family should have begun to flow again as soon as the younger son had filled his brother's place. It don't fit in. Either your Alice Spier-the-Span was a humbug, or there is more to come.\" \" I have not the least objection to your pass ing that judgment on old Alice's reputation as a seer,\" said Lindesay ; \" her rhyme is not exactly part of the canon of Scripture, and I have but told the tale as it was told to me.\" \" And exceedingly grateful we are to the teller,\" said Lady Annabel. \" Let us hope, from the in terest Mr. Paxton has shown in the narrative, he will some day give it to us in a poetic form.\" Mr. Paxton laughed. \" If I do, my dear madam,\" he said, \" it will not be till I get the sequel, and with that Mr. Lindesay has not yet favoured us.\" The guests now began to separate ; those who had to seek their homes gradually took their leave and disappeared ; and as the family party also broke up, Geoffrey was ushered to his own apart ment, well pleased that the first half of his peni tential exercise at Swinburne was happily over."], [63, "( 55 5 CHAPTER VI. GEOFFREY IN AN UNEXPECTED POSITION. The breakfast-bell at Swinburne did not ring be fore half-past nine o'clock, a much later hour than any to which Geoffrey was accustomed ; and as, according to his wont, he had risen considerably earlier, and on descending below had found no vestige of animated existence, he had sallied forth into the grounds to look about him, and enjoy the invigorating influence of a sharp frosty morning in the open air. Very different, indeed, was thc scene presented, even in winter time, by Swin burne Park, with its rare and magnificent ever greens, its close-shaven turf, and its acres of glass houses, to the old-fashioned garden of Laventor, which Geoffrey loved to keep in the trimmest order, but on which, as on everything else in the Laventor establishment, there was stamped that character of \" homeliness \" which fashionable critics no doubt would have despised, but which had proved so attractive to Aurelia Pendragon. Geoffrey was leaning over a stone balustrade,"], [64, "56 URIEL gazing at the slopes of the park, and considering within himself whether southdowns or shorthorns would be the best quality of animal to put upon such a bit of land, when the unmistakable whiff of a cigar came upon his olfactory senses, and a step on the gravel behind him warned him that he was not alone. He turned and recognised without dis may the black bush of hair owned by Mr. Paxton. Without dismay, for wholly indifferent to that gentleman's lofty pretensions as the literary dic tator of the age, and perhaps not very accurately posted as to his claims on that position, Geoffrey had remarked him only on the previous evening as one whose conversation he could understand, and who seemed to say precisely what he meant without using any roundabout expressions. Such would have been Geoffrey's criticism on the great est word-master of the day, had he ever dreamed of passing any criticism at all on the subject, nor is it to be doubted that Paxton would have ap preciated his judgment as afar better compliment than many lavished on him by editors and re views. For himself, he was so habituated by long custom to the study of characters and of coun tenances, that after passing through a score or so of drawing-rooms, all filled with specimens of humanity, masculine and feminine, who seemed finished off to order on about three or four models, all more or less artificial, to come upon this un-"], [65, "GEOFFREY IN AN UNEXPECTED POSITION. 57 sophisticated bit of honest Enghsh nature, look ing so out of harmony with the men and women around him, piqued the great artist's curiosity, and he was not displeased with the chance meet ing which gave him an opportunity of further examination. \" A bad habit, I am aware, Mr. Houghton,\" he said, as he threw away the remains of his early cigar ; \" but what is one to do in a household where the idea of the breakfast-hour oscillates between nine and eleven ? \" \"It's amazing,\" replied Geoffrey; \"why, the afternoon must be beginning before they have ended the morning. How could one get through business that way ? \" \" I fancy,\" replied Paxton, \" that business is perhaps the last idea that would intrude itself on the mind of any resident at Swinburne.\" \" I don't see why,\" said Geoffrey ; \" not business, perhaps, in the way of shops, or \u2014 or \u2014 anything of that sort ; but every man has his business.\" \" You mean,\" said Paxton, delighted to dis entangle the thoughts of his companion, and assist him to find a tongue, \" you mean that a man's business is his work, and that no man is worthy of being called a man who has no work to do, or who does not do it ? \" Geoffrey was greatly astonished to find that he"], [66, "58 URIEL. had meant to say so much, but on reflection he agreed in his companion's interpretation of his thoughts, and expressed his agreement by the brief ejaculation of \" Just so.\" \" I have heard Mr. Wyvern spoken of as a great worker,\" continued Paxton ; \"I have now spent three days with him, and I have not yet been so fortunate as to discover his line, unless it be water-colour sketching.\" \" Wyvern does not do himself justice,\" said Geoffrey, whose esteem for his friend was a motive powerful enough to drive him to find his English. \" He works, yes, certainly ; is always at it, one thing or another ; but I fancy he don't care to be \u2014 well \u2014 mobbed, you see, and so forth.\" \" Yet he is called a genius,\" said Paxton. \" Yes,\" replied Geoffrey ; \" it's a word they are uncommonly fond of using nowadays. Julian Wyvern is a very good fellow ; but it nettles me considerably to hear every silly girl you meet talk of him as ' such a genius ! ' What do they mean, I wonder : all the fellows I knew at school who were called geniuses turned out to be sad idle dogs.\" \" And you don't think Mr. Wyvern deserves that reproach ? \" continued Paxton. \" Well, now, since I have been here I haven't seen him even play a game of billiards as if his heart was in it. He lies on the sofa, or plays cat's-cradle with the"], [67, "GEOFFREY IN AN UNEXPECTED POSITION. 59 children, or turns over the contents of old Miss Abbott's work-basket ; but not two words of sense have I heard him put together.\".! Geoffrey stopped short on the gravel-walk, along which they were making their way towards the house. \" It's the place,\" he said; \" it suffocates one, with its plate-glass and its Dresden china.\" \" Do you object to old china ? \" inquired Paxton. \" By no means,\" replied Geoffrey. \" What I mean is, that in a place like this whatever you look at, if it is but a soap-dish, sets you thinking what it must have cost. That is one thing. Then, you see, I don't mean to excuse Julian for trying to look like an ass when he isn't one ; but when people are shoving at him to show off as \u2014 as \u2014 a peacock, so to speak \" \" I see,\" interrupted Paxton, \" the peacock is not to be blamed for declining to exhibit his feathers. But what is the connection with the Dresden soap-dish ? \" \" It's all of a piece,\" said Geoffrey, floundering among the dibris of his own ideas. \" Just what Julian don't fit into \u2014 expensiveness, show-off, and talk about great people and geniuses.\" \" Well, Mr. Houghton,\" replied his companion, \" I think I catch your view of the subject. They are only different aspects of one and the same thing \u2014 what we call the world. Expensiveness"], [68, "60 URIEL. means the pride of money, by displaying one's money's-worth ; that is the vulgarest form of worldliness. Then the running after great people and geniuses, and the trying to make everybody stand in an attitude and assume a character \u2014 well, all that is worldly too, and quite as unreal, though perhaps it can put on a better show. But you are right in your principle, which, I take it, is this, that all worldliness is vulgar? \" My stars ! \" cried Geoffrey, in irrepressible surprise, \" what a thing it is to have the use of one's tongue ! I didn't know I had said that ; but it is as true as the Gospel, and that is why Julian Wyvern can never be seen to advantage in such au atmosphere. He has not a spark of the world about him.\" \" I am sure of it,\" said Paxton, \" only when he is a little older, and has knit himself together a little more tightly, he will come to understand that in every atmosphere a man should venture to be himself. He need not assume one sort of affectation to escape another. You don't do so, Mr. Houghton, if you will excuse the freedom of such a remark.\" The passing reference to himself escaped Geoffrey's notice : he was considering how he could put in a good word for his friend, whom he sincerely believed that Paxton did not ap preciate."], [69, "GEOFFREY IN AN UNEXPECTED POSITION. 61 \" Wyvern returns with me to-day,\" he said, \" and I would lay any wager we shall not have got out of the park gates until he will be himself again. I wish you could see him as he is at Laventor ! you would not know him for the same fellow.\" \" Thank you,\" said Paxton, \" I should like immensely to accept your invitation. I hardly know anything I should like so much.\" Geoffrey was startled, and began to wonder what invitation he had given. It seemed to him that his companion possessed a wonderful gift of making him say a great deal more than he was himself conscious of saying, or even of thinking ; but there was no time for explanation, as at that moment the breakfast-bell sounded, and they both hastened back to the house. Not a little curious were the looks which some of the party directed towards the two gentlemen as they entered together. They seemed such strangely matched companions, and what was to Mabel the most extraordinary feature of the case, Geoffrey Houghton appeared so wholly un conscious that there was anything remarkable about it. \" A thousand pardons,\" began Mr. Paxton ; \" I had no intention of keeping you all waiting ; but Mr. Houghton beguiled me into a talk on the terrace, and I believe we both forgot the time.\""], [70, "62 URIEL The two sisters exchanged glances. \" Do you really mean that you have been walking out before breakfast at this time of year ? \" said Mabel ; \" it gives one the shivers to think of it.\" \" Yes,\" he replied, \" I do actually mean that before you had opened your eyes to ' Ph\u0153bus' tardy beam,' Mr. Houghton and I had taken several turns on the terrace, and got deep down into all manner of knotty questions.\" \" How delightful ! \" said Lady Annabel ; \" what would I not give to have had a fairy taking shorthand notes of the conversation ! \" \" Uncommonly glad you had not,\" thought Geoffrey, remembering the Dresden china. \" But now,\" she continued, \" you never give us the benefit of such delightful talks. What was it all about, Mr. Houghton? You know we are all envying you ; somebody once said that all Mr. Paxton's thoughts were golden.\" \" On this occasion the thoughts were entirely furnished by Mr. Houghton,\" said Paxton, \" and I was little more than valet-de-chambre to his ideas, trying to clothe them in well-fitting garments of words.\" Breakfast went on, and so did the conversation, and not one of the company but evinced a certain change of manner towards Geoffrey Houghton to what they had previously shown him. A simple ton he certainly could not be, who had been"], [71, "GEOFFREY IN AN UNEXPECTED POSITION. 63 chosen for the coveted distinction of an hour's tete-d-tete with the most distinguished man of letters all England could produce, and who could furnish ideas which the greatest master of the English tongue should think worthy of clothing with language. It was a wonderful state of things, and bid fair in an hour or two to lift our simple hero himself into the place of the lion. \" Are you really leaving us ? \" said Lady Annabel, addressing herself to Paxton, who had alluded to his speedy departure. \" We had hoped to have kept you safe out of the London fogs for one more day.\" \" I am not returning to London to-day,\" re plied Paxton ; \" Mr. Houghton was good enough this morning to ask me to accompany Julian to Laventor, and I really had not self-denial enough to refuse.\" It would be difficult to say who was most sur prised by this announcement \u2014 the assembled company, or Geoffrey himself. He had not the least recollection of giving the invitation, and would as soon, have thought of doing so as of inviting Count Gleichen or old Miss Abbott ; and he was within an inch of saying as much, when Julian, perceiving him on the verge of a dis astrous blunder, hastened to his rescue. \" Now, that is first-rate,\" he said ; \" exactly what I have been wishing ; it would be nothing"], [72, "64 URIEL short of a sin for Mr. Paxton to leave Cornwall without seeing the weirdest and most Arthurian corner of it. I am so uncommonly glad you thought of it, Geoffrey ; \u2014 it was a real stroke of genius.\" \"Genius again,\" growled Geoffrey to himself; \" they are all beside themselves, and so, I think, am I. I wonder if Mary has thought about the dinner ? Thank heaven, there's the dog-cart.\" The vehicle in question at that moment ap peared ; and in it the three gentlemen having taken their seats, Geoffrey drove from the doors of Swinburne Park, carrying with him its two most illustrious guests, to the wonder, and possibly to the envy, of more than one whom he left behind him."], [73, "65 CHAPTER VII. AT LAVENTOR. The arrival of Geoffrey with his two companions made some little stir in the home circle of Laven tor. Julian was expected, but the appearance of the illustrious stranger, whose claims to respect were somewhat more keenly appreciated by the ladies of the party than they were by Geoffrey, could hardly fail to cause a sensation. It took but a few minutes, however, for every one to feel at home with him. There is a certain magic possessed by really great minds, which lies, perhaps, in their power of communicating themselves. The shyness and embarrassment which render intercourse with some of our fellow-creatures so painful a penance may on examination be traced to the fact that no real intercourse has at those times taken place, and that we and they have simply stood in each other's presence, like so many empty violin cases, imparting no music to one another, and perhaps having none to impart. But let one be in the company of richer capacities, and it needs but a E"], [74, "66 URIEL touch to call out some melodious notes ; and if, as in Paxton's case, the gifts of intellect are linked with unusual powers of sympathy, the great mind finds ways of giving itself forth to little ones so pleasantly, that whilst the charm is sensibly felt by all, the vast superiority of the master intellect is scarcely guessed. And so it came to pass that before he had been an hour in the house, Mrs. Houghton had assured her daughters that Geoffrey's new friend was very agreeable ; and Mary, whose first inclination had been to remain silent and awe-struck, was able to impart to Geoffrey the consoling news that she did not feel a bit afraid of him. This gratifying intelligence was imparted in her brother's study, when the guests and the other members of the family had retired to their respective apartments, previous to reassembling for dinner. It was, in fact, the particular moment which Mary was accustomed to devote to what she called \" seeing after \" her brother, especially at times when he was likely to have any unusual duties of hospitality laid upon him. On such occasions she generally con trived to pay him a ten minutes' visit, giving him little hints and scraps of information which she trusted he might turn to profit, sometimes even having an eye to his toilet, and giving it some finishing touches of her own. On this occasion she found Geoffrey provokingly unconscious that there"], [75, "AT LAVENTOR. 67 was anything to be afraid of in the new element he had imported into the family circle ; nor was he in the least prepared to think that he was required to depart from any of his customary ways and habits, in deference to so distinguished a guest. So, much to his own satisfaction, Paxton, an hour later, found himself seated at the hospitable family board, and enabled to make his observations very much at his ease. Julian and Rodolph were the only other guests, and both of them were at home at Laventor. The dinner went on as dinners do. Geoffrey stuck to some old-fashioned ways, and persisted in carving at the head of his own table ; and while so engaged he was generally grave, or what Rodolph ' called \" solemn.\" He had early become aware of the fact that the only way for him to do anything well was by giving it his whole attention ; and he had thus acquired the habit of putting an amount of gravity into his manner of doing small things, which often provoked that gentleman's ridicule. But though his carving absorbed too much of his attention during the early portion of the entertainment to give him the use of his tongue, it did not entirely deprive him of that of his ears, and he was just the least in the world annoyed to hear Rodolph flourishing a little on the subject of his yesterday morning's walk with Aurelia, out of which he was making conversational capital."], [76, "URIEL 68 \" What a change there will be up there when the old gentleman goes to heaven,\" he said. \" I suppose Marmaduke, M.P., will then come in for everything.\" \" What ! the Pendragon of Eaglehurst ! \" said Julian ; \" is he the next heir ? \" \" I fancy so,\" replied Rodolph. \" You know there are no sons left now, since the last one was hanged or drowned \u2014 which was it ? \" \" Hanged ! \" said Paxton, with sudden interest, as he recalled the lines on the meaning of which he had been speculating the evening before ; \" was that the fate of the last heir of Merylin ? Then that would fit into the second line of the old prophecy ! \" But just then Julian looked up, and saw poor Geoffrey struggling with mixed emotions : the effort to use his carving-knife and fork for the ordinary purposes for which those implements are intended battling with a vehement desire to throw them at Rodolph's head. He saw also a piteous expression on Mary's countenance, and plunged forward to the rescue. \" You must know, Miss Houghton,\" he began, \" we sat up last night and got Lindesay to tell us ghost stories, and bloody bones legends, till our heads were well crammed with horrors. Mr. Paxton is prepared to find you all living in enchantment, and I have pro mised to guide him to the exact spot on the sea-"], [77, "AT LAVENTOR. 69 shore where Excalibur was flung into the mere.\" Then, having secured Paxton's attention, he led him on to some of the curiosities of Cornish topo graphy, and on once more glancing at his host's countenance, perceived by its relieved expression that he had done him a timely service. Later on in the evening, when the party had returned to the drawing-room, Mary found her opportunity at a moment when the others were engaged in conversation ; and as Julian took a seat beside her, she endeavoured to express her thanks. \" I was so grateful to you at dinner,\" she said ; \" Mr. Beresford did not see and you did.\" \" In a foggy sort of way,\" said Julian. \" I only comprehended that unless relief was speedily mini stered, Geoffrey would certainly have choked.\" \" They had touched on a painful subject,\" said Mary. \" Geoffrey, you know, has made the Pendragon troubles his own. I saw he could not bear having them ventilated in that careless way over the dinner-table.\" \" Do you know,\" said Julian, \" I have a very dim sort of idea what their troubles were. People make allusions, and shake their heads, but I have never heard the real story.\" \" Oh, it is no secret : Uriel, the last surviving son, when only nineteen, was charged with a murderous assault and robbery. It seemed incon ceivable, he had always appeared so good ; but"], [78, "70 URIEL they supposed there must have been secret debts to account for it. It was fully proved, and he was condemned to five years' penal servitude. At the end of that time they tried to get him off to America ; but news came that a few days after he had sailed he fell overboard and was drowned. The poor old father has never got over it, and at the time they feared he would lose his reason. He recovered after a while, but he has never passed the threshold of his own home since the first shock of the disgrace. You could not estimate it fully unless you knew what sort of pride the Pendragons have always had in their family honour.\" \" What a sad story ! \" said Julian. \" I re member it now. He was in the army, I think, and the affair took place with a brother officer. I have heard, too, of the family pretensions : they must truly have come down with a crash.\" \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"I don't think there is much of that sort of thing left now. Aurelia has nothing of it. I sometimes fancy that she feels all this is a sort of punishment, and that she and her father are expiating the pride of their ancestors.\" \"And what was Geoffrey's share in the history?\" said Julian. \" Dear Geoffrey ! \" replied Mary, \" he has been like a son to the old man, and has done everything"], [79, "AT LAVENTOR. 71 for him. You will laugh if I say it, but I really think his devotion to the father and daughter is his romance ; his poem, I was going to say, if the notion of Geoffrey and poetry were not so incongruous.\" \" Why incongruous ? \" said Julian. \" I don't know, of course, what you mean by poetry ; but what I understand of it has nothing that would not suit the dear old fellow excellently well.\" \" Really ? \" said Mary ; \"just explain.\" \" Why, it is very simple, I think,\" replied Julian ; \" poetry deals with what is great and noble, with what is above the common standard, and that is just what I take Geoffrey to be.\" Mary's eyes sparkled with delight ; it was so rare a pleasure for her to hear Geoffrey thus spoken of. \" He is indeed,\" she replied ; \" only one does not expect the world to guess at the treasure hidden under that rough exterior,\" and she glanced as she spoke at the figure of her brother, as he stood with his hands in those everlasting pockets, listening to Paxton's easy talk with much indiffer ence as to the impression he might himself be making on his guest. \" The world ! \" said Julian ; \" oh, of course the world cannot appreciate what is above its standard. But we were not speaking of the world, but of poetry. I know what you are thinking of,\" he"], [80, "URIEL 72 continued, as he followed the direction of Mary's eyes ; \" you would say that there can be no poetry without beauty, and it is true ; but the beauty must be within, in the first instance. If it is not there, it is nowhere. Outside show is not beauty.\" \" Do you know,\" said Mary, \" I was thinking how like that is to Aurelia. Every one who sees her speaks of her beauty, and it is simply dazzling. But for all that, there is something in it I never understood till now. She never seems to value it, hardly to be conscious of it, or if conscious, seems to wish only to hide it away. What she makes me feel is far more the beauty of soul than of person.\" \" That is to say,\" said Julian, \" that in her case the beauty of the soul has overflowed ex teriorly, and you see it. Well, if we could see the soul of dear old Geff, we would just veil our eyes from the splendour. I tell you I know him through and through, and there is not a selfish fibre in him. If that is not poetry, I should like to know what is, let the world say what it likes about grace, and 'so forth.'\" Mary smiled at the httle allusion to her brother's catchword, and understood all that Julian meant to imply by its use. She felt that he had precisely what Rodolph had not \u2014 a keen perception and delicate feeling for others \u2014 and a"], [81, "AT LAVENTOR. 73 sympathy was at once established between them, which was felt by both to be very pleasant. \" Poetry and beauty,\" said Paxton, who had caught the words in the lull of the conversation, and seemed to think he had a right to join in the discussion. \" Now, in the name of both those capital things, Miss Houghton, will you soften your excellent brother's heart, and try and persuade him to find some way by which I can get admitted within the haunted towers of Merylin Castle ? He assures me no profane foot is ever suffered to enter there ; and of course my desires to taste the forbidden fruit have imme diately increased a hundred-fold.\" \" If you could prove yourself an architect, you might have a chance,\" said Mary ; \"I don't know any other expedient.\" \" An architect ! \" exclaimed Paxton, \" well, one never knows till one tries \u2014 I think I once built a pig-sty.\" \" Ah ! to be sure,\" said Geoffrey ; \" I was forgetting about the chapel ; I promised I would ask you about it, Julian. D'ye see, they want something done to it, and don't know how to set about it. I said I was sure you would find them the right man.\" Julian listened whilst his friend related the substance of Miss Pendragon's conversation on the previous day ; he took in the whole case with"], [82, "URIEL 74 surprising quickness : the desirableness of arous ing the old baronet's interest, the rocks to be avoided, and the object to be attained. \" Bluemantle is your man,\" said Rodolph, \" that is, if you want first-rate quality, work, and design.\" \" Bluemantle is a puppy,\" said Julian, \" and as arbitrary as the Czar. If he had a mind to sweep the mortuary chapel right away, he would do it, and never take a word from any one. There's Gules : he would do exactly what he was told, though I am not sure if he has gumption enough for such an undertaking. If he had a plan, he would carry it out, but the plan is the difficulty. Do you think one could see the place ? \" \" Of course,\" said Geoffrey ; \" and, besides, it has been engraved and photographed a dozen times. Mary will get you a portfolio full of views, but they will give you no idea of the state of the roof, which is half a ruin. Gives you the rheumatism to go there, but till now the old man would not have it touched.\" \" Well, then, you'll take me there to-morrow,\" said Julian ; \" that's settled.\" \" And myself as architect's assistant,\" said Paxton. \" Have no fear, I will sit up all night with a glossary of Gothic architecture, and lay in such a vocabulary of ' corbels ' and ' string-"], [83, "AT LAVENTOR. 75 courses' as that Mr. Wyvern shall be able to pass me off for Bluemantle himself, if needful.\" Meanwhile the portfolio, of which Geoffrey had spoken, was produced, and its contents at once fired Julian's enthusiasm. He examined the photographs with the eye of a real artist, and was lost in admiration of their architectural beauty. \" What proportions ! what elegance, what marvellous tracery ! \" he exclaimed, \" to think of such a jewel crumbling to ruins for want of care ! I've half a mind to say it must be Bluemantle, after all. But we must see it first.\" And so the expedition to Merylin, to Paxton's great satisfaction, was fixed for the morrow."], [84, "76 CHAPTER VIII. SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. Rodolph's departure at an early hour the next morning prevented his forming one of the little party who, shortly after breakfast, took their way up the steep hill, and through the dark pine woods which surrounded the venerable pile so often mentioned in these pages. Geoffrey was not sorry that circumstances had delivered him from the necessity of introducing his loquacious friend along with his other guests. The feelings with which he was wont to regard the castle and its inhabitants were of that character which would not bear the touch of ridicule, and perhaps he was conscious that there was just such a spice of what Mary had called \" romance,\" as would be most likely to provoke it. From his present companions, however, he had nothing to fear. Paxton's interest in the scene before him was unmistakably genuine, and as to Julian, his imagination had received a certain degree of ex altation from his conversation of the previous"], [85, "SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. 77 evening, and he was prepared to see in everything appertaining to the Pendragons and their residence \" a beauty and a mystery.\" His was one of those characters whose judgment is not always able to make head against their impressionability, and it was this facility with which his sympathies were aroused and kindled by new objects which led superficial observers to charge him with fickleness of purpose. They reached the courtyard gate, where Paxton failed not to search for the mark left by the mysterious dagger, as related in the Legend of Sir Caradoc. They passed through the quaint old hall with its armour and its pictures into a panelled chamber with high antique chimney, over which appeared a portoait of the hapless cavalier who had died on the scaffold, the golden haired Sir Arthur, as he was called ; and Geoffrey was just explaining that the golden hair was not a metaphor, but a reality, when the door opened and gave admission to Aurelia. Prepared as he had been by Mary's words to look for beauty, Julian was yet startled by that which he now beheld. He gazed at her as he would have done at a picture of Raphael or Correggio ; for the form that stood before him, in its sable robes and flow ing golden hair, did not seem to belong to the work-a-day world of the nineteenth century. It was a dream, a vision ; for a second or two every-"], [86, "78 URIEL. thing around him assumed the same character ; until he was roused by hearing Geoffrey's attempt at an introduction, and advanced to reply to her salutation. All that he had heard of the Pen dragons, their lofty lineage, their honourable fame, and their unparalleled misfortunes, rushed upon his mind, and imparted to his own manner an un wonted degree of earnestness and respect. Geof frey stood apart and looked at them ; and thought to himself what a noble pair they were ! Aurelia was just a princess \u2014 he had never thought of her as anything else ; but Julian \u2014 for the first time he became aware that his friend also was cast in the highest type of humanity. Why, if you had dressed him in black velvet, and given him a laced collar and a peaked beard, it might have been the martyred cavalier himself who was standing there. It was a wondrous picture ; but as poor Geoffrey stood and beheld it, he caught sight of the reflec tion in a pier-glass at the end of the room, which gave him back, at the same time, the image of his own ungainly person ; and for the first moment in his life the pang of a dreadful passion seized upon his heart. Shame and mortification were mingled with a new feeling to which he could give no name, but it at once such created a dis turbance within him, that in his simplicity he bethought him if he were going mad. \" I'm a fool, I know,\" he said to himself; \" I've known"], [87, "SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. 79 that all my life, but this is lunacy.\" Alas, poor Geoffrey ! it was only his first attack of the pas sion of jealousy, and, unluckily for him, it was not to be his last. It was not lessened when, tak ing their seats, the subject of the chapel and its projected restoration was at once brought under discussion. Julian understood it all so surpris ingly, and he expressed himself so well ; to hear him and Aurelia talk together, whilst now and then Paxton dropped in a judicious word, it seemed as though there was a sort of freemasonry between them all. \" Why, it would have taken me a week to have said all that,\" thought Geoffrey, \" and I shouldn't have made it clear, even then ! \" Evi dently here were people who had been made out of the same lump of clay ; and Geoffrey felt that whereas his particular bit of mother earth had turned him out a rough specimen of very common earthenware, those before him might have been likened to some wondrous vases of finest porcelain. \" Well, of course,\" he tried to reason, \" it's all as it should be : here are the descendants of kings and crusaders ; with a poet, as they call him, ready to put them both into verse. A century ago, the Houghtons were just honest yeomen \u2014 no wonder I am not up to this sort of thing \u2014 it's just what one might expect.\" Admirably argued, and his honest heart did its best to accept the inevitable conclusion, but not the less did the sharp pang"], [88, "80 URIEL. continue to wring that poor heart, and drown it in bitterness. Julian begged to see the chapel, and Aurelia at once arose and led the way. Even in its pre sent ruinous condition, his practised eye could discern the wonderful beauty it must once have possessed. The tall lancet windows of the eastern apse were filled with fragments of ancient glass ; the walls of the sanctuary, discoloured by damp, yet showed remains of painting ; the carving of the screen and reredos was broken and defaced, but enough was left to indicate its former beauty of design. A little chapel, at the extremity of a side aisle, contained the monuments of two knights, and names cut deep into the stones of the pavement. The burial-place of the Pendragons, dug out of the solid rock, lay below, and Aurelia explained that the chapel was a chantry, and that Mass was said here daily for the souls of the departed members of her house. \" The chapel is dedicated to St. Michael, is it not ? \" asked Julian. \" No, not exactly,\" said Aurelia ; \" guide-books and such things say so, but the real dedication is to the Holy Angels, a much more uncommon one, as you are probably aware. Our family has always cherished a peculiar devotion to the Holy Angels : my father bears the name of Michael, as you know, and I could not count up all that have been called"], [89, "SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. 81 by that name, to say nothing of Gabriels, and others,\" and she pointed to two flag-stones engraved with the names of \" Arthur \" and \" Gabriel \" Pendragon. \" My two brothers,\" she said. Julian thought to himself: \"And Uriel, the third, where is he ? \" But Aurelia continued : \" You would not understand the chapel if you did not know its dedication. All those defaced paintings on the walls were angelic figures, I believe ; and the seven windows of the apse are said to have been filled with representations of the Seven Spirits ; St. Michael, you see, is still perfect.\" \" I beg pardon,\" interrupted Paxton, \" I am an outsider, you know, and these things are new to me. Do you only reckon seven angels ? My notion of them was a sort of starry host, which no man living could number.\" \" But with seven stars of greater magnitude than the others,\" said Aurelia ; \" the ' Seven Spirits before the throne.' The devotion to these ' Seven Spirits ' has been a favourite one in our family, and I believe the old wall paintings I spoke of bore traces of it.\" \" I must know something more about those Seven Spirits,\" said Julian. \" If that was the idea in the mind of those who built the chapel, it would furnish a key to the whole of the symbolism. Where can I learn all about the i'"], [90, "URIEL 82 subject, for I fear my notions, at present, are a little indistinct ? \" \" If you will come to the library,\" said Aurelia, \" our chaplain, Father Segrave, will, I daresay, give you all the authorities you can desire. He has made the chapel his special study, and is longing to see it saved from destruction.\" To the library, then, they adjourned, a room which bore the same stamp of antiquity as the rest of the building. Its dark oaken shelves were filled with tomes, of which a considerable number exhibited vellum bindings and folio proportions, though there was a fair number of volumes in more modern garb. Father Adrian Segrave speedily made his appearance, and proved to be a cheery-looking man of middle age, whose ecclesiastical soutane Paxton appeared to scan with curious eye. He expressed his satisfaction that something was going to be done for the chapel, and was anxious to know into whose hands Mr. Wyvern proposed to commit the work. \" I don't know,\" said Julian ; \" I am going to beg for four-and-twenty hours of reflection on the subject. But my inspection of it just now has suggested many new ideas ; and Miss Pendragon gives me hopes that you will help to clear up some of them. I want more perfect instruction in all that regards the Seven Spirits. If, as I"], [91, "SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. 83 gathered, they are the patrons of the chapel, the symbolism of the ornamentation would all bear reference to the fact, and to destroy that would be to blot out the meaning of the whole fabric.\" \" Ah,\" said the chaplain, \" I see that Mr. Houghton made a wise choice in selecting you for our counsellor in this business ; that is just the point on which no mere architect could be trusted. I look on the chapel as a sort of sub lime hymn in honour of the holy Angels, written in characters half-effaced by time ; if restored by one who cannot read those characters, something more precious than a specimen of thirteenth century architecture will be lost for ever.\" \" Exactly so,\" replied Julian, \" and for that reason I want to know all that is to be known on the subject. ' The Seven Spirits,' \u2014 the expression is familiar to me ; and there, I fear, my know ledge begins and ends.\" \" It occurs several times in Holy Scripture,\" said Father Adrian, \" once in the Old Testament, and several times in the New. St. John, in the Apocalypse, names them four times, and always with very special tokens of reverence ; they are ' the seven spirits before the throne,' and are elsewhere called ' the seven lamps,' and ' the seven eyes,' expressions which all indicate a great nearness to God ; like officers, as it were, who hold a position in the court of a great king."], [92, "84 URIEL Then as to their names, we are certain, of one, at least, of the number, for he has told it himself : ' I am Raphael, one of the Seven who stand before the Lord.' Only two others, Michael and Gabriel, are named in Scripture ; for the other four we are indebted to rabbinical tradition, they are Uriel, Sealthiel, Barachiel, and Jehudiel.\" \" I seem to know one of those names,\" said Paxton ; \" does not Milton tell us something about \" ' Uriel, gliding through the even on a sunbeam ?'\" \" He does, indeed,\" said the chaplain, taking a volume from a bookshelf near him as he spoke. \" Milton was learned in all the literature of the angels, whether scriptural or rabbinical. Nothing escaped him ; and out of the bare interpretation of a name he has given us the magnificent portrait of this glorious angel as \" ' The same whom John saw also in the sun.'* For the name is held to signify ' the light, or fire of God,' and so the great poet has worked up his picture of \u2014 * \" And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice,\" &c. (Apoc. xix. 17.) This angel is supposed to be St. Uriel \u2014 an idea which Milton has carefully developed, locating him in that luminary, and clothing him with its light.

Then turning to Julian, he added, somewhat abruptly : \" You will find all you want in a volume of Cornelius a Lapide, some what too cumbrous for you to carry off, but you shall have it in the course of the afternoon.\" \" And the other, too, if you please,\" said Julian, \" I must have those lines. It is a picture one can never forget.\" \" For which,\" said Paxton, \" you are indebted to me ; don't forget that. Mr. Segrave may furnish you with as many volumes of Cornelius a Lapide as he pleases, but the theologian, in this matter of the angels, you will allow, must yield to the poet.\" \" Pardon me,\" said the chaplain, \" but I admit nothing of the kind. All that the poet found to say, he had first gathered out of the theologian. Milton's lines, beautiful as they are, are scarcely more than a versification of Holy Scripture. Angels, Mr. Paxton, are beings of fact, not of imagination.\""], [94, "86 URIEL \" Beings of fact ! \" said Paxton. \" I see that is your way of regarding them. I don't deny it, you know ; but if you don't mind my saying so, it is this way of reducing beautiful ideas to the category of plain facts, something to be classified and ticketed like so many shells or minerals in a cabinet, that puzzles me so in persons of your persuasion.\" \" But you don't surely deny that the angels are facts ? \" said Aurelia. \" I don't take on me to deny anything about them,\" said Paxton, \" knowing so absolutely no thing on the subject. But I have been more used to regard them as ideas \u2014 symbols, perhaps \u2014 beautiful and spiritual symbols of an order of things that is above us, and beyond our grasp, so long as we are detained in the bonds of mor tality.\" \" But that would be very unsatisfactory to me,\" said Aurelia ; \" one could not pray or talk to an idea ; one could not think of a symbol as a friend. Yet what friends are as near and dear to us as the angels ? \" \" Yes, that is what is so extraordinary,\" said Paxton, \" that is what I cannot understand ; \u2014 that realistic view which Catholics seem to take of everything.\" Julian laughed. \" Just what I have oiten said,\" he exclaimed, \" the distinguishing feature"], [95, "SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANGELS. 87 of Protestantism is unreality, and the strong point of Catholics is their matter-of-fact. You can tolerate angels patiently enough in a poem, but are amazed at our business-like way of invoking them as if close at hand. Just ask Geoffrey there what he thinks of the matter : I'll answer for it, he will tell you he never goes to bed without saying the 'Angele Dei.'\" Geoffrey, to say the truth, had not been assist ing at the conversation with all his attention. The disagreeable emotions which had disturbed him at the beginning of their visit had not yet been laid to rest, and whilst the other members of the party had been busy over the discussion he had sought for distraction in a newspaper. At the sound of his name, however, he looked up, and Paxton could not suppress a smile, as he gazed at the honest, simple face, with its look of inter rogation. \" I don't exactly know what the ' Angele Dei ' may be,\" he said, \" but if it is included in Mr. Houghton's daily devotions, the cause is decided.\" \" The ' Angele Dei ? ' \" said Geoffrey, with but a dim comprehension of the point in question, \" why, of course, it's in ' The Garden of the Soul;'\" and he resumed his newspaper. \" From that authority there is no appeal,\" said Julian ; \" and now, it seems to me, we have taken up enough of Father Segrave's time. As to the"], [96, "88 URIEL chapel, Miss Pendragon, don't suppose that our talk has put it out of my head ; but you must give me time to think it over. I am only clear on one point, and that is, that what we have to fear is the too much, not the too little.

We must think of something better than that, and you shall hear in a day or two.\" \" Thanks,\" said Aurelia ; \" and I see that Father Adrian is preparing to send you a cart load of books ; so there is no fear that you will forget the angels.\" No fear, indeed ; and as they left the castle, and once more took their way through the pine woods, the bell from the chapel belfry tolled out the Angelus. At the sound Julian and Geoffrey stood still, and uncovered their heads, and Paxton observed them in wonder. He was too well-bred to utter his comments ; but perhaps he was thinking that for men to stay their conversation at the sound of a bell and pray in silence was another example of realism. And perhaps it was."], [97, "( s9 ) CHAPTER IX. JEALOUSY. It was a somewhat silent walk home, for each member of the little party found matter in his own reflections to absorb him, agreeably or the reverse. Paxton had received some new ideas, and was working them out in his own fashion. Geoffrey's cogitations may be imagined by any who can draw from their own experience a re membrance of the anguish, the falsehood, the injustice, and the bitter self-reproach which accom panies a fit of that passion which of all the passions to which our poor nature is subject, most surely carries its own punishment with it. Julian guessed nothing of his companions' feelings. He was in a fairyland of enchantment. The castle, the chapel, the beautiful Aurelia, visions of angels, and legends of the old British kings, were jumbled together in his imagination like some strange arabesque design ; and as they took their way through the woods, the very bleakness and desola tion of the wintry landscape only harmonised with"], [98, "90 URIEL his frame of mind. It was a new \" Idyll of the King.\" On reaching home Geoffrey escaped to his own study, on pretence of business, whilst the other two found their way to the drawing-room. Julian wanted some one to whom he could pour out his impressions, and found a willing listener in Mary. \" And how about the chapel ? \" she asked. \"Oh, nothing decided; but I have a plan in my mind. I haven't dared propose it yet, but \" \" But what ? \" said Mary, with surprise, as she saw by the flash of his eye that something a little out of the common was in contemplation. \" I must do it myself,\" he said ; \" I could not leave that old man and his daughter in the hands of Bluemantle. I'll make the plans, and Gules shall work them out. I can nail him to what I want done, and no more. And then the paint ings, they must be carefully restored. I see it all,\" he continued, thrusting his hands through his hair in the intensity of his excitement, \" and the seven angels \u2014 it will be glorious.\" Mary said there were books which described what the paintings had been a century or two ago, and the afternoon was spent in consulting a dozen or two of volumes, scattered about the tables and sofas in delightful confusion. Paxton threw him-"], [99, "JEALOUSY. 91 self with good humour into the interest of his companions, and had a happy way of opening the books at just the right places, and finding the right passages to read aloud. St. Uriel was not forgotten ; and Milton's lines were read over again to the two sisters, who sat in a kind of rapture, listening to tones which once heard were not easily forgotten. But when he came to the \" Golden tiar of beaming sunny rays Circling his head,\" Mary started. \" Surely you are putting some thing in, are you not ? \" she said ; \" you do not mean to say those words are Milton's ? \" \" They certainly are,\" said Paxton ; \" where is the wonder ? \" \" Only,\" replied Mary, \" that it sounds like the portrait of another Uriel \u2014 the last of the ' Golden haired ' brothers.\" \" Now, fancy my not having thought of that ! \" said Julian. \" I understand now why Father Segrave stopped so suddenly when he came to those lines, and why Miss Pendragon looked as though she would rather not listen.\" \" But it is all Greek to me,\" said Paxton. \" Who is the ' other Uriel ' of whom you speak ? And why should not Miss Pendragon listen ? \" In brief words Mary gave him the outline of"], [100, "URIEL 92 the same sad tale she had already related to Julian. Paxton listened with interest. \" Ah,\" he said, \" here, then, we have the second line of the old prophecy fulfilled, ' Till fall'n its heir by fell disgrace.' \" As he spoke he took out his pocket-book to refer to the lines which he had scribbled down at Swinburne from Lindesay's lips, and it was his turn to start as he read them. \" Are we really living in enchantment ? \" he said. \" Just listen to this ; \u2014 I declare I had not noticed till now that there was an allusion to the angels,\" and he read aloud the words already quoted : \" Fortune shall fail the Dragon's race Till, fall'n its heir by fell disgrace, Angel by name, with angel face, A peasant born shall fill his place.\" They all agreed that the coincidence was extra ordinary. Only one point seemed obscure : was he who was to bear the angel's name and the angel's face to be the heir, or the peasant who should fill the place of the heir ? \" Like all prophecies,\" said Paxton, \" it will be clear only when accomplished.\" \" Probably,\" said Julian ; \" and now, I don't know whether you will think me fanciful or ' realistic,' if I say how strongly it is borne in"], [101, "JEALOUSY. 93 upon me, that if the ' fortune of the dragon's race ' is ever restored, the angels will have some thing to do with it. Who knows even if the restoration of their chapel, which we are now busy over, may not be the first step ? \" And so the hours of that winter's afternoon wore away. They were pleasant hours to all the party, and to one perhaps more than to the rest. A French writer has declared that there is a period in every life when \" the beans are in blossom,\" and the atmosphere of our existence is perfumed by a new and charming exhilaration. The beans of Mary Houghton's life were beginning so to bloom. She was tasting the new and unspeakable delight of converse with companions whose intel ligence, if vastly superior to, was yet sympathetic with her own. That winter's afternoon was marked in her calendar with a very bright red letter ; and for the first time in her whole life, perhaps, she forgot to ask herself, \"Where was Geoffrey ? \" Geoffrey was sitting in his study over a bleak, cheerless fire, trying to analyse his own feelings in his own way. Our readers must not think the worse of him on account of this wholly unexpected fit of rebellious nature. The son of Adam has not yet been found, we presume, in whom there does not lurk a poisonous root of self-love, which only comes to light under the assaults of tempta-"], [102, "URIEL 94 tion. And to do Geoffrey justice, he battled bravely with his unknown foe. \" What is it to me,\" he asked himself, \" how many bows Mr. Julian Wyvern makes to Miss Aurelia Pendragon ? What is it to me if the descendant of King Arthur thinks the presumptive heir to the Earldom of Snowdon a pleasanter companion than plain Geoffrey Houghton ? Did I ever go in for being pleasant or graceful ? Have I not served them out of love, and pity, and compassion ; and shall I cease to do it now because I saw my own reflec tion in a mirror, and was ashamed of it ? It's just vanity \u2014 that's what it is, ami jealousy \u2014 a fit of cursed jealousy.\" And having reached this final and true analysis, he rose from his chair and paced about the apartment. At last he stopped short : \" There shall be no more of this,\" he said ; \" I am a simpleton, that every one knows ; but I will not be a contemptible one. What a base lie it all is ! Jealous, and jealous of Julian Wyvern, because, forsooth, he is a handsomer fellow than I am ! No, by the soul of my grand father, there shall be no more of it. It's nothing but cursed jealousy.\" He reappeared at dinner, and during the repast was more than usually silent, and carved vindic tively. \" What can be the matter with Geoffrey ? \" said Mrs. Houghton to her daughters, when they"], [103, "JEALOUSY. 95 were alone together ; \" he seems so out of sorts.\" \" Only out of temper, dear mamma,\" said Gertrude ; \u2014 \" something has happened to ruffle him, I suppose ; distemper among the pigs, or the turnip disease.\" \" How can you, Gertrude ? \" said her mother, \" you know he is never out of temper. I'm afraid he must have got a chill in that dreadful chapel ; \u2014 if he had only had something warm when he came in ! \" Then as the object of her motherly solicitude happened to enter the room, with brows still clouded, and discomfort in every line of his countenance, she carried on her attack. \"My dear boy, I'm convinced you've taken a chill; you look all' colours ; \u2014 and no wonder, after standing about in that damp chapel. You should have taken something warm when you came home, you really should. It's a rheumatic cold, I am certain.\" \" Rheumatic fiddlesticks,\" growled Geoffrey ; \" I'm right enough.\" \" You're all wrong, Geoffrey ; I am sure of it,\" persisted his mother. \" Now, do take something to-night \u2014 / should say ginger.\" There was something in the notion of adminis tering a dose of ginger to cure a fit of the spleen so intensely ludicrous that Geoffrey laughed in spite of himself, and the laugh did him good. He sat"], [104, "96 URIEL down by his mother's side, and felt a gleam of re turning good-humour as he did so. After all, to a heart with all its honest home affections still untarnished, what is there so medicinal as the look and word of a mother, even if she has nothing more exalted to propose than the administration of a homely restorative ? Geoffrey felt it so, and though he was not so compliant as to accept her prescription, yet his angry spirit was \" healed and harmonised \" by the benignant influence of his mother's love. Whether he slept much that night is not on record, but he arose with a great light in his mind. The discovery that his malady of the previous day had only been \"a fit of cursed jealousy \" had brought the light with it. There is but one known panacea for that disease, which moralists would express by different terms, but which Geoffrey, in his unadorned style, was pleased to call \" flying in the face of it.\" And so, when he appeared at breakfast next morning, with his complexion still \" all colours,\" and his hair on end (for there is no part of our outer man which so sympathises with the inward mood as our hair), there was yet in his great, brave heart, the strength of a firm resolve, which he prepared to carry out unflinchingly. The first event of that morning was the depar ture of Paxton, and he took his leave reluctantly. He found something pleasant to say to each one."], [105, "JEALOUSY. 97 before he bade them adieu. Mary could not help telling him how sorry she was he was going. \" Not more sorry than I am, Miss Houghton,\" he said, \" only regrets of this sort are like snow balls ; they would increase in bulk by every addi tional day I spent here. But I am delighted I came ; \u2014 delighted to have known that good brother of yours ; take good care of him, young ladies, you'll not find another Uke him. I shall not easily forget my two days at Laventor, nor the Pendragons, nor the angels, nor our famous con ference yesterday afternoon. If the foolish world did but know how little goes to make a winter's day captivating \u2014 and, by-the-bye, if anything new turns up in ' the fortunes of Merylin,' you must be sure and let me know.\" As soon as he had driven from the door, Julian took possession of Geoffrey, to make known to him that he had matured his plans about the chapel, and to ask his aid in carrying them out. He would offer his own services to Sir Michael, making out a rough plan of what was to be done, and employing Gules in carrying them out. But would this be acceptable ? Geoffrey listened, and as he did so the future seemed to unroll itself before his eyes like some prophetic vision. If Julian undertook the work, he would remain here to do it. He would, pro bably even, take up his residence at the Castle, G"], [106, "98 URIEL and become as one of the family. And in the charm of his society, in the sunny influence of his conversation, his gifted mind, his graceful inter course, the old man would find a new tie to life, and who could say how it might end with Aurelia? He saw it all : Julian would bring the healing sunshine to that desolate hearth. Julian would do what he could never have done. He could be useful, and faithful, and true, and devoted : \" Ah, yes,\" thought Geoffrey, \"but I could never be charming.\" Just one moment of bitterness, and it was over, and the resolution of the morning came back strong and vigorous. He listened and nodded, and said the idea was an excellent one. No one could do it so well as Julian ; no one would understand it all as he did, no one had such taste, no one had such judgment. Of course, he must go up to the Castle again without delay, and propose his plan. \" And you'd best go alone this time,\" he added : \" you'll get on better with out me, and I have business at the mill.\" So to the mill he went ; and if it were reverent to make such speculations, we should be disposed to guess that some of those strong, sweet angels, of whom they had been so lately conversing, went with him, and kept company with him that day, as he fought with the bitterness of his own heart, and conquered. They were surely there, helping him to drive away the falsehoods which self-love kept whispering, and to bear the dreary discomfort"], [107, "JEALOUSY. 99 of his feehngs ; and when he came back at the close of the day, it was with a heart at peace with himself, and with all the world beside. When Mary paid him her usual visit before dinner, she found him looking pale and tired, indeed, but the cloud was gone. \" What has been the matter, with you, old fellow ? \" she said. \" Mamma would have it it was a cold ; Gertrude said it was temper ; and it looked to me very like a fit of the dumps.\" Geoffrey drew his sister to him, and kissed her. \" Gertrude was right,\" he said ; \" something hap pened which put me out. The devil, I suppose, was seeking something to devour, and he tried to lay hold of my heart ; but I think I've been even with him.\" Mary looked at him affectionately. His gray eyes were weary and faded, but there was, or she fancied there was, a look on his face she had never seen there before : the beauty of the soul was streaming through the chinks of its rough mortal covering. \" Dear old Geff,\" she thought to her self, \" to think of my having been enjoying myself while he was suffering ! How selfish I have been, and how generous he is ! \" And Mary was not far wrong, for few things are more selfish than some kinds of happiness, and none more ennobling than a battle with one's own nature."], [108, "100 CHAPTER X. A SHIPWRECK. It is not our purpose to give the reader a circum stantial journal of Mr. Julian Wyvern's residence at Laventor, which Geoffrey persuaded him to make his headquarters ; nor minutely to follow the progress of his plans for the restoration of Merylin Chapel. Suffice it to say, that the plans were made and approved, not without many visits to the Castle and prolonged consultations with Sir Michael and his daughter. Mr. Gules came down from London, and was glad enough to accept Julian's orders and carry out his designs. The decoration the young man was resolved personally to superintend, and he had already conceived the idea of restoring the wall paintings of the seven angels, and executing them himself in fresco. It was an ambitious thought, but he prepared for carrying it out by first making cartoons of the angelic figures, with their appropriate emblems. In this he was not a little helped by Father Se grave, who supplied him with information, and"], [109, "A SHIPWRECK. 101 was a frequent visitor at Laventor whilst the work was in progress. Six of the cartoons were already roughly sketched, but over that of Uriel Julian could not satisfy himself. Perhaps the associa tions attached to the name gave him a special desire to succeed in the delineation of the angel, whose appearance as the \" Light of God,\" had so fired his imagination. \" The Light of God ! \" he said ; \" what a wonderful name, and how to de pict it ! \" \" I should have thought those lines of Milton's would have shown you how,\" said Mary ; \"to me they were a picture in themselves.\" \" Ah, yes, a word-picture ; and if I could dip my brush into one of those sunbeams I could perhaps represent what he has sung ; \u2014 but how paint sunbeams with these gross material pig ments ? ' The Light of God ' is something be yond the range of yellow ochre.\" \" There is another title applied to St. Uriel,\" said Father Adrian ; \" he is sometimes called ' the Strong Companion ' : his emblem, you know, is a sword.\" \" That is a different idea of him,\" said Julian : \" I can see no connection between the two.\" \" Not so very different,\" said the chaplain. \" I can see a sort of connection. The sword, you see, which is the symbol of strength, is likewise the shining brand or flame. I take it to mean that"], [110, "URIEL 102 the Light to know, must be united to the Strength to do? \" A magnificent thought,\" said Julian, \" and worthy of its subject. ' To know the best and choose the weaker part ' is just the misery of us mortals ; but to an angel, standing in the Light of God, the Light to know the Truth cannot be dis joined from the Strength to do the Sight. To paint that idea would need the hand of Michael Angelo. Anyhow we must set to work on the two elements of Light and Strength.\" But do what he would, he pronounced his attempts to be wretched fail ures, and one after another committed his sketches to the flames. Still he worked on, and the days sped merrily by ; and many a morning as Julian painted and Mary lent her aid, Aurelia would look in to praise and encourage, and Gertrude to criticise and make fun ; whilst Geoffrey would stand by, lost in wonder how people could be found in the world so amaz ingly clever, \u2014 a feeling in which his excellent mother heartily shared. But it must not be supposed that Julian's in terest in the Chapel of the Angels had driven the lifeboats out of his mind. His was a head that could carry many ideas in it at the same time ; and not a few were the expeditions he undertook during the winter months to various stations on the Cornish coast in hopes of inducing the autho-"], [111, "A SHIPWRECK. 103 rities to adopt his improved model. At some he was successful, at others he failed. He was speci ally mortified in the rejection by the Chelston and Tremadoc authorities of his proposal for improv ing the appointments of the lifeboat station at the latter place. Mr. Marmaduke Pendragon's influ ence prevailed with the Chelston Corporation, and he was an advocate for \" economising the public money.\" There was a station at Penmore, a village within seven miles of Tremadoc, admir ably supplied ; and to spend money on fitting out another so close, was thought to be super fluous. Besides, argued the economists, Trema doc possessed a boat of the old construction, which answered every purpose. What more could all the wise men of Chelston desire ? Rodolph Beresford lent his wit in ridicule of the notion that Mr. Wyvern should be indulged in his whim for making lifeboats as common as blackberries \u2014 though he had not suggested the means of making them as cheap ; and so the plan was negatived. All that Julian could obtain was the acceptance of his reforms by the authorities at Penmore, where he had the satisfaction of see ing one of his new boats manned by a brave and skilful crew. Those who know the Cornish coast do not need to be informed that, more perhaps than any other part of England, it is the scene of pitiless storms"], [112, "URIEL 104 and terrible shipwrecks. The early part of the winter had been comparatively calm, but shortly after Christmas a tempestuous season set in. Julian had the consolation of learning that on various occasions his boats had worked well ; and more than once he had been on the spot when their services were called for, and had taken part in some of their expeditions, in order the more thoroughly to satisfy himself as to their real powers and requirements. This, in fact, was no new thing with him. During the years he had devoted to the study of this particular subject he had frequently accompanied the lifeboat crews, and had thus acquired a considerable amount of skill and practical knowledge. One day towards the end of January the heavy sky gave unmistak able warning of an approaching hurricane, and before the close of the day it fell on the coast with wild and terrible fury. Julian was debating within himself the advisability of his betaking himself to Penmore with the view of being on the spot should occasion call for the launching of his new boat, the \" Speranza,\" when word was brought to the Laventor household that mischief was at work much nearer home. The rock, on the sum mit of which Merylin Castle stood, formed a bold promontory, which on one side protected Tremadoc Bay, often sought as a harbour of refuge by small fishing vessels in distress. The sharp rocks which"], [113, "A SHIPWRECK. 105 terminated this promontory were continued at in tervals far into the ocean, and formed a kind of reef, exceedingly dangerous in stormy weather. On this reef a vessel of considerable size had struck, having become utterly disabled in the storm ; and the event created all the more ex citement from the fact that vessels of such a size and character were rarely seen off that particular part of the coast. Geoffrey and Julian did not wait to hear more, but hurried to Tremadoc, where they found the intelligence too true. It was a large steamer, French, as it appeared by its build, and everything betokened that its condition was utterly hopeless. Guns of distress were being fired from time to time, and there seemed a cer tainty that many hours could not elapse before the luckless vessel would have beaten to pieces upon the rocks. The one thought was how to bring relief to the distressed crew ; \u2014 but what ordinary boat could live in that frightful surf? \u2014 and thanks to the economists, the much-needed new lifeboat was wanting. \" We must telegraph to Penmore at once,\" said Julian, \" and mean while see what can be done with our Tremadoc resources.\" The old boat was dragged out and launched, and at Julian's call ten brave fisher men were found ready to man it. He was stand ing, directing its equipment, when he was startled by a voice behind him. \" A reward of fifty pounds"], [114, "106 URIEL if the ship is reached, Michael Harris,\" said Aure lia Pendragon, speaking to one of the men, who acted as coxswain. A cheer from his companions was the only reply, whilst Julian felt a sort of consternation at beholding the young girl at such a scene, and exposed to such a tempest. \" You here, Miss Pendragon ! \" he said, \" in such awful weather, and in view of so awful a spectacle ; surely it is hardly prudent.\" Aurelia turned towards him her pale, calm face, in the lofty strength of which there was not a shadow either of haughtiness or severity. \" You came here to do your duty, Mr. Wyvern,\" she said, \" and I must do mine. I care nothing for the weather.\" \" Let her be,\" said Geoffrey ; \" it's her way. She waits to take charge of the drowning. I've known her do it dozens of times.\" And, in fact, Aurelia had come down from the castle bringing with her everything requisite for the restoration of the sufferers who might be rescued, and their conveyance to proper shelter. She looked and acted as one perfectly accustomed to such critical scenes, and with a presence of mind entirely devoid of excitement. The boat was ready, and the ten men leapt in ; but an eleventh was wanted. Michael Harris had taken the helm, and one of the ten oars therefore was left unmanned. Without a moment's hesita-"], [115, "A SHIPWRECK. 107 tion Julian sprang in, and desired them to shove off. \" For the love of heaven,\" exclaimed Aurelia, fearing for another when she did not fear for herself: \u2014 \"yet why shouldl stop him? \" she added. \" All good angels protect him this night ! \" It is needless to say with what eager eyes and beating hearts those who were gathered on the shore stood watching the gallant efforts of the little crew to reach the scene of the disaster. Twenty times they approached the reef, to be whirled away again by the billows before they could come near enough to cast a rope to the sufferers, some of whom had already been washed away by the hungry waves, which broke over the deck of the vessel. Geoffrey stood watching it all through his glass, and thought he could make out the forms of women as well as men. \" Poor souls ! \" he said ; \" what a fate ! the boat can never reach them, even if it can live in such a sea ! \" But just then through the roaring of the wind and the waves, came the sound of distant cheering. Yes, tbe lifeboat had certainly come within distance and a rope had been shot over the wreck. The suspense was terrible. Amid the blinding storm and the increasing darkness of the evening it was difficult to make out what was going on at the wreck. Some thought they could see dark figures dropping from the vessel as though jumping into the boat; then came a cry, a tre-"], [116, "108 URIEL mendous sea had broken over all, and once more the lifeboat had burst from its holding and was carried far away among the breakers. \" What are they doing, \u2014 returning? It can't be,\" said Aurelia. \" Yes, all right ! \" replied Geoffrey ; \" they are bringing back those they have saved, but alas ! how few ! \" Seven individuals, passen gers as it would seem, had in fact been rescued, and among them was one lady, whose speech bespoke her of foreign extraction, and who, in terms of frantic grief, made known to those who stood around that her daughter was still upon the deck of the ill-fated vessel. Her words were incoherent ; but Aurelia, who had at once taken charge of the poor stranger, could just make out that her daughter had insisted on her being the first to make use of the means of escape ; that the danger was imminent, and, that a \" brave monsieur,\" moved by her agony, had leapt from the lifeboat on to the deck of the steamer and was in the very act of lifting her daughter into the arms of those below, when the great sea had come and swept them far away, and her daughter, together 'with her brave dehverer, had been left behind. \" It must have been Julian,\" said Aure lia, and she looked at the crew of the lifeboat, and discerned too surely that her surmise was correct. Only nine men stood to their oars ; the tenth was wanting !"], [117, "A SHIPWRECK. 109 They would return again ; there were more lives to save. They would rescue the brave young gentleman who had risked his life so nobly ; \u2014 another fifty pounds if he were brought back alive ! Aurelia's words and the magic of her presence put new life and courage into the hearts of those she addressed, and with a ringing cheer they prepared for a second adventure. But alas ! the struggle with those awful waves had strained the old boat, only half sea-worthy ; and though the men did their best it had become unmanageable, and their utmost efforts threatened to be unavail ing. Some dreadful moments passed. \" The wreck is breaking up,\" said Geoffrey. \" Merciful heaven, what will become of Julian ? \" Aurelia hid her face in her hands and could only pray : she had no courage to look on the last consum mation of the disaster. But at that moment another cheer, and yet another, broke from the fishermen on shore. \" She is coming ! \" they cried ; \" it is the lifeboat from Penmore ; the brave young gentleman's own boat, the gallant ' Speranza ' ! \" Aurelia looked up, and there it was ; the great powerful lifeboat, manned by a sturdy and numerous crew, was doubling the headland, and flying through the breakers to the scene of danger. They succeeded at last, after many efforts, in getting within the required dis tance ; men and women were being saved, that"], [118, "URIEL 110 was clearly discernible ; then came a peal of thunder and a flash of blue forked lightning, which seemed to strike the very spot on which all eyes were fixed ; something dark leapt up amid the lurid light ; then came a crash, and when they looked again the wreck was no longer visible ; its last fragments had broken away, but the lifeboat, with its precious freight, was coming homewards. Was Julian safe ? was the poor stranger's daughter rescued ? The minutes seemed hours till those questions could be answered. At last the boat had reached the shore, and those of the crew and passengers who had been saved from the wreck were being landed. Some were much injured by blows from broken spars, and one young girl was lifted out insensible. The mother's cry of joy, mingled with anguish, told who she was ; and Aurelia at once took pos session of her as her own charge. \" And Julian ? \" \u2014 She only waited to behold Geoffrey rush into the surf and support his friend's ex hausted form as he helped him to reach the place of landing. He was safe and she asked no more ; and without another moment of delay she gave her whole attention to the service of the sufferers."], [119, "111 CHAPTER XL ST. URIEL. Julian was brought home to Laventor in a state of such extreme exhaustion that Geoffrey felt serious alarm as to his condition. He feared at first that his friend must have sustained some fatal injury ; but though this happily proved not to be the case, the next day found him so little advanced towards recovery that, greatly to his own disgust, a messenger was despatched to Chelston to summon a doctor. The doctor came, and had the air of being puzzled. \" There are no bones broken,\" he said, \" no internal injury that I can discover ; \u2014 fatigue, no doubt, and exhaustion : but you tell me Mr. Wyvern is used to this sort of exertion ? otherwise I should be disposed to say his nervous system had sustained a shock, and that all that he wants is absolute quiet.\" \" Very mysterious,\" said Geoffrey, in reply to the questions with which his mother and sister overwhelmed him ; \" of course, Julian is as sensi tive as a what d'ye call it ; \u2014 and I have seen him"], [120, "URIEL 112 shake and tremble before now, when anything, as you may say, touched him on the nerve. But not in danger, and still less this sort of danger, which he is used to, and I believe delights in. I have heard him say more than once that the thrill of ecstasy which some men feel in a cavalry charge he has felt when battling with a tempest.\" \" Yes, \" said Mary, \" but what comes after those thrills ? Ecstasies are rather prostrating sorts of things, I fancy.\" And it really seemed as though Julian had had such an ecstacy ; for though after a day or two he was able to reappear in the family circle he was still silent and abstracted. The first use he made of his restored strength, such as it was, was to insist on making the journey to Penmore that he might see and reward the brave crew of the \" Speranza.\" \"Would he not wait a day or two ? \" Geoffrey urged, with every show of prudence ; \" or could he not communicate by letter ? \" \" No, not an hour,\" was Julian's abrupt reply ; \" besides, I have other business.\" Geoffrey could only shrug his shoulders, and explain his friend's peculiarity by reminding himself that he was a genius, and that the orbits of such rare luminaries are not to be calculated. The same day brought them the pleasure of a call from Rodolph Beresford, who, as a matter of course, had heard \" all about everything,\" and"], [121, "ST. URIEL. 113 was already well informed as to every circumstance in the late events, including many which had not yet reached the less curious ears of the Laventor household. \" So the Wyvern romance has ended in a wreck and a rescue ? \" he began. \" What wonderful people you are who live under the shadow of the Merylin towers : I never come this way without expecting to meet a giant or a fiery dragon.\" \" I do hope now,\" said Mary, \" that the Chelston people will see the necessity of a proper lifeboat. But for the coming of the ' Speranza,' neither Mr. Wyvern, nor the eighteen persons saved with him would ever have been seen again.\" \" Eighteen, were there ? \" said Rodolph care lessly. \" And twenty-eight, I believe, drowned ? Yes, I daresay something will be done now. You know it was Sydney Smith who said we should never get Smithfield market set to rights till there had been an alderman or two tossed by an infuriated bullock.\" \" We shall not wait for the tender mercies of your friends at Chelston,\" said Geoffrey, rather gruffly. \" I have seen Miss Pendragon this morn ing, and she intends supplying Tremadoc with a proper boat at her own expense.\" \" Bravo, Aurelia ! \" said Rodolph, in a tone of patronising eulogium ; \" the httle lady is open- H"], [122, "URIEL 114 handed with her money \u2014 perhaps just a trifle lavish. Fifty guineas to the lifeboat men, you know, was coming it rather strong. And now a new lifeboat ! The ancestral acres won't bear many such pulls. But I'm told there was a romance going on ; and heroines of course don't stick at a trifle, when the hero is in danger of being swallowed up alive.\" Geoffrey felt in a rage, but did not just then know how to express it. \" What romance are you speaking of ? \" said Gertrude. \" It was an awful night, and I believe Mr. Wyvern really did distinguish himself. But was there anything more ? \" \" Only,\" said Rodolph, \" if what I hear is true, that the hero of chivalry flew to the rescue of one fair lady, while another was making wild offers to the fishermen of Tremadoc to induce them to save him from destruction. It would make a first-rate tale in three volumes, and end, I suppose, as all tales do end, in a marriage.\" Geoffrey's state of helpless rage continued. He happened to know that in the dreadful moments he had passed by Aurelia's side, she had promised to make this offering of the new lifeboat out of her own private means, if Julian's life were pre served. Aurelia herself had given him this con fidence, and he gathered from it that her own interest in his friend Wyvern was of a warmer"], [123, "ST. URIEL. 115 character than that of ordinary acquaintanceship. But he would sooner have made his general con fession at the market cross of Chelston than have breathed this fact into the ears of Rodolph Beresford. \" Well, but suppose,\" continued Rodolph, \"just suppose that the gallant knight should lose his heart to the wrong lady ? If Julian the Brave should happen to be won by the superior charms of the Fair Imogen ! \" \" Of whom are you talking ? \" asked Gertrude. \" Of the Fair Imogen, of course,\" said Rodolph. \" Don't you know, have you not heard, that the lady he rescued turns out to be Mdlle. Imogen de St. Brieuc, or some such intensely Breton name, that she and her mother, the Countess de St. Brieuc, are guests at the Castle, and I believe have discovered that they are thirty-second cousins to the Pendragons ? The Fair Imogen is reported to be fabulously rich, and amazingly beautiful, only instead of being ' Fair ' she is dark, and has jet black eyes and raven locks. I thought you would certainly have seen her.\" No ; they had not seen her. The simple fact was that both they and Aurelia had been too much taken up since the shipwreck with the task of nursing their respective invalids to do more than send messages of inquiry to one another. That the unknown lady and her daughter were"], [124, "116 URIEL still guests at the Castle had indeed reached the ears of the Laventor party, but they had heard nothing as to their name or nationality. A thought flashed through Geoffrey's brain, which the next moment he rejected as prepos terous, and then again it returned with redoubled earnestness. Could there really be a grain of foun dation in Rodolph's surmises ? Was it possible that Julian's highly wrought and over sensitive imagination had fairly carried him away into the land of romance, and that his unaccountable abstraction since the evening of the wreck was somehow connected with his romantic deliver ance of Imogen de St. Brieuc from a watery grave ! He prudently, however, gave no utter ance to this fancy, even to Mary ; and the latter, on the departure of Rodolph, bethought her that it was high time for her to make her own in quiries how matters were faring with all at Merylin. So to Merylin she took her way, where she re ceived a hearty welcome from Aurelia, on whose countenance she discerned an unusual animation. It had been a new interest to the motherless and lonely girl to find herself the hostess of two guests, who had been thrown on her hospitality under such romantic circumstances ; and Mary soon discovered that Madame de St. Brieuc and her daughter were the chief objects of considera tion at that moment to the whole household at"], [125, "ST. URIEL. 117 Merylin. When she herself was introduced into the apartment which Imogen still occupied as only partially convalescent, she was forced to own that Rodolph's praise of her beauty was not exag gerated, nor was it very surprising that Aurelia should appear considerably taken up with the interesting stranger. Mary apologised for her own and her mother's delay in coming to inquire after them, by explaining that they also had had their anxieties regarding the hero of the adventure, \" Ce Monsieur Jules,\" to whom .the Countess was most anxious to make her acknowledgments ; whilst Imogen could not say enough of his self devotion in saving her mother, and remaining to protect her on the wreck. \" But how did it really happen ? \" asked Mary ; \" Monsieur Jules, as you call him, has told us nothing whatever about it, and I can get little out of my brother except that there was a tre mendous flash of lightning, and that then every thing came right.\" Imogen covered her eyes with her hand at the mention of the lightning. She could scarcely say what had happened ; except, indeed, that there had been a fearful flash ; that it had seemed to light up a face and a gigantic form, and that \" un grand homme bleu, grand, mais mon Dieu, grand comme les tours de St. Denis? had risen, as it were, out of the waves, and had seized her in"], [126, "URIEL 118 his arms, and after that she knew no more till she woke to consciousness lying on her bed in the tapestried chamber of the Castle. Mary could not suppress her laughter. The \"grand homme bleu \" was so manifestly one of the Penmore fisher men, whose proportions, increased by his life-belt and other accoutrements, might well appear gigantic at such a moment in poor Imogen's eyes. So, after courtesies exchanged, and press ing messages which she promised to deliver faithfully to \" Monsieur Jules \" on the part of the ladies he had so gallantly rescued, Mary took her leave, a little oppressed, and even a httle saddened by her visit, though why she could hardly say. In point of fact, she was feeling, what Geoffrey had felt before her, that new ac quaintances and interests would inevitably alter in some degree the mutual relations between Merylin and Laventor. Hitherto she had been Aurelia's only friend, and Geoffrey had been Sir Michael's only adviser. Now new elements had been thrown into life at the Castle ; and while poor Mary tried to rejoice at the thought that on Aurelia's life some gleams of sunshine were begin ning to fall, she could not but give a sigh as she thought of the dear old days when they had been all in all to one another. With something of this weight on her spirits she sought her brother's room, and proceeded to"], [127, "ST. URIEL. 119 give him a report of her visit, and her impressions of the two strangers. \" Very distinguished, both of them, I suppose,\" she said ; \" but somehow the whole house seemed in a flutter.\" \" Yes, I know,\" said Geoffrey, \" I was there yesterday. Plenty of French flummery. Now, look here, Mary, because I've been thinking it over very seriously, and I have something to say. You know it can't be helped, and we ought not to wish it. I've seen it ever since Julian first came here. One feels it a bit, you know, and all that ; but it can't be helped, and we ought not to wish it otherwise.\" \" Wish what, you dearest and best of Geffs ? \" asked Mary ; \" I don't think I am wishing any thing.\" \" Yes, you are, Mary, or rather, you are re gretting something which must not be regretted. I was fool enough a month or two ago to do the same ; it was that night when you told me I was in the dumps ; and you were right, for I was. I felt as though Julian were taking the wind out of my sails, just as you are feeling now about these Frenchified people. Now, Mary, you mind me, I've gone through it, so to speak, and come out on the other side. Don't you concern your self about it. I love Sir Michael and his daughter, and I've done my best to serve them, and I'll do it still so long as they want a friend ; and you,"], [128, "URIEL 120 too, stick to Aurelia and be what you ever have been to her. But don't be surprised if they find in others what they cannot find in us. You know the old proverb, ' Sparrows must not mate with eagles.' Leave the Wyverns and the Pendragons, the Julians and the Imogens, to understand one another and to make a match of it, if they like ; what have Geoffrey and Mary Houghton to say nay to, if they do ? \u2014 Believe me, Mary, they are the eagles and we are the sparrows ; and I'm glad of it,\" he continued, taking the poker in both hands, and administering some energetic blows to the coals ; \" I'm heartily glad of it.\" Mary sighed. \" You are right, Geff ; you always are,\" she said, \" yet one hates changes.\" \" Stuff and nonsense ! \" replied Geoffrey. \" I beg your pardon, my dear, I don't mean to be rude, but if you hate changes you must belong to some other world than ours. You were a child once,- and now you're a woman ; and it's winter now, and by and by, it will be summer \u2014 every thing is change, and we must just make the best of it.\" \" What a wise old Geff you are growing ! \" said Mary. \" Do you know, I think sometimes that you are changed from what you were. Per haps it is all this that has done it.\" And indeed a great change had been coming over Geoffrey during the last three months. He"], [129, "ST. URIEL. 121 had suffered, and he had overcome himself. His struggles with himself had brought him both Light and Strength ; Light to comprehend his own heart, and Strength to master his own selfish ness. Such struggles are the true spiritual educa tion, by which a soul expands and frees itself; and so it had been in Geoffrey's case. He had suffered much, and the suffering had refined, elevated, and ennobled him. Perhaps he had learned some secrets of his inner heart of which he would have been content to have remained in ignorance ; and had discovered that his fierce but momentary jealousy of Julian had more connec tion with the favour with which he could not but perceive his friend was regarded by Aurelia than he had chosen to imagine. It was a bitter humi liation to him to become aware that Aurelia Pendragon was anything more to him than a friend whom he served because he pitied her. That he, the ignoble, ungainly simpleton that he was, should have suffered such a folly to steal into his heart, was a shame only to remember. But the fact remained that there it had found its way, and the only remedy was his favourite one of \" flying in the face \" of his weakness. Julian Wyvern was the one man worthy to aspire to such an alliance ; and if his help were needed to smooth the way to such a consummation, why, it should.be given. And so Geoffrey had come"], [130, "URIEL 122 to persuade himself that the thing on which his heart was most set in this world was to see these two beings, so dear to him, each in their own way, and so far above him in every respect, happily united. It was late before Julian returned from Penmore, and he looked weary and disappointed. \"Julian, old fellow, what's wrong?\" said Geof frey, as they sat together after the ladies had retired. Julian looked at him for a moment steadily, and then he said : \" Tell me the truth, Geoffrey, do you think me a fool ? \" \" What a question, Julian ! you know I think you just about the cleverest fellow going.\" \"And not mad or bewitched?\" continued Julian; \"because I have my own doubts on the subject.\" Geoffrey looked serious. \" I say, Julian,\" he began, \" this is what comes of knocking about the country when old Barker wanted you to keep quiet. You know, you had an awfully near go of it, the other evening, and it has told on you.\" \" You know nothing about it,\" said Julian ; \" but if I were sure you would not chaff me, I would tell you what has shaken me to my centre.\" \" No,\" said Geoffrey, \" I leave chaff to Rodolph ; it's not my way. Tell me what is on your mind, Julian \u2014 it will be better, believe me.\""], [131, "ST. URIEL. 123 \" Well then, listen,\" said Julian, \" and think what you will, provided you believe that what I am going to tell you is the plain simple truth. The other evening when our boat reached the wreck the first time, we had got about seven of the people safe down, and among them was an oldish lady. I had observed her on the deck of the vessel, together with another younger than herself, who I presumed was her daughter. The daughter obliged the men to take her mother first, and before she could follow there was a cry that the rope was parting. You know how it is at such times, one acts pretty much on the spur of the moment ; I felt, happen what might, the poor mother should not see her child drown be fore her eyes ; and before I well knew what I was doing, I caught hold of a rope and swung myself on to the deck beside her. I meant to have lifted her down to the others, but it was too late, and in another moment the boat had been carried far out among the breakers. Well now, Geoffrey, I tell you honestly I thought at that moment it was all over with me. I was sure that they would take back those they had saved, and that that old ramshackle concern would never stand another trial. And so it proved. You know what happened next ; how the ' Speranza ' hove in sight, and came to our res cue. But you do not know all. It was a hard"], [132, "URIEL 124 struggle for her among those terrible breakers, and again and again we thought she would never accomplish it ; at last we saw her close below us, and looked, as it were, into the faces of the men, not an oar's length from us ; then came that tre mendous sea, and a flash of vivid lightning that seemed to set the ocean in a blaze. And sud denly there seemed to rise out of the waves, and in the very midst of that burning light, a gigantic form, and a face \u2014 oh, such a face ! \u2014 ay, you may smile, Geoffrey, I knew you would, but it was no human face I gazed on. It was all light, living light and splendour ; and there streamed out the long golden hair, as of an angel ; not the puny womanish things that idiots paint, but a strong, mighty angel. It was only for a moment that I saw that face, and then the great towering figure stood beside us. He raised the girl in his arms as if she had been a feather, and I presume lowered her into the boat ; but then came a great crash ; the last timbers had parted, and I found myself struggling amid the rocks and breakers. Another moment, and I believe I should have been swept away, when that great, strong arm was round me, and bore me up. They drew me into the boat, and I know no more of what happened till we touched the shore and you were lifting me, and helping me to stand.\" '"], [133, "ST. URIEL. 125 \" Well ? \" said Geoffrey, \" and what is it you are thinking ? \" \"I think,\" said Julian, \"that it was the angel Uriel.\" Geoffrey looked at him. \" My dear fellow,\" he said, \" the thing is clear enough. You have had that angel Uriel in your mind for the last two months to my certain knowledge. How many times have you been painting him, or trying to paint him, and how many times have I heard you making your meditation aloud over your brushes and canvas, 'Light and Strength \u2014 The Light of God and the Strength of God,' and so forth. Then comes all the whirl and danger of the shipwreck, and in the blaze of an awful lightning-flash you see a huge Cornish fisher man, who looks like a giant, as perhaps he was \u2014 we're a biggish set of fellows in these parts \u2014 and he hoists you out of the waters ; then you lose consciousness, not unnatural under the cir cumstances, and when you come to life again you think you have seen an angel.\" \" Famously reasoned, my dear Geoffrey,\" said Julian. \" I did not know you could put two and two together so well. But it's no use talking. That face was not the face, and that hair was not the hair, of a Cornish fisherman. I tell you, it was living, shining gold.\" \" H'm,\" said Geoffrey, somewhat maliciously,"], [134, "126 URIEL \" and very probably you've been thinking a good bit about golden hair of late. And you see it has all got jumbled together like things in a dream, and this is what comes of it.\" Julian smiled. \" Well, I've spoken it out now, and I'm all the better for it,\" he said. \" Don't repeat it, there's a good fellow ; any one but your self would say I was an ass to give it another thought, only mind this, I saw the Light, and I felt the Strength. But there, we'll say no more about it. I'll go up to-morrow and pay my re spects to this Lady Imogen, as you call her, and then we'll return to our brushes.\" He got up and proposed rejoining the ladies. \"All right,\" thought Geoffrey to himself; \" he's not thinking of Imogen, that's one com fort. But, my stars alive ! how glad I am of one thing, that I was never born a genius ! \""], [135, "127 CHAPTER XII. THE SEVENTH CARTOON The visit to Madame de St. Brieuc and her daughter was accomplished with all propriety ; and, when it was over, Julian, as he had said, lost no time in returning to his brushes. He shut himself up in his own room, and painted vigor ously from morning till night ; appeared at meals with lack-lustre eyes and hair standing on end (an evidence, as Gertrude suggested, that he had sought inspiration by pulling it), then disappeared again, and continued to paint, taking no exercise, not appearing to care about his food, and never so much as looking at a newspaper. This state of things continued for about a week, at the end of which time he called Geoffrey into his painting-room. There, on an easel, was the result of his labours, a marvellous design, which Geoffrey found little difficulty in recognising as a reproduction of the vision of St. Uriel. There was the gigantic form, illuminated with a won drous light \u2014 there was the Light and the Fire of"], [136, "128 URIEL God blazing around it and above it ; and in the midst, a face, calm, majestic, and of superhuman strength, with golden hair that streamed out be hind into the darkness, \" The golden tiar of beaming sunny rays Circling his head,\" and forming its only aureola. An exclamation of wonder and delight broke from Geoffrey's lips. He was not much of a judge of art, but there was a life and power in the sketch before him which sent a thrill through his whole system. \" My word, Julian,\" he exclaimed, \" but you've done it at last : let Mary see it.\" Mary was called, and at the first glance could only cry out, \" St. Uriel ! 0 Geoffrey, how beauti ful ! There is the Light, and the Fire, and the Strength \u2014 you see it has come at last,\" she con tinued, turning to Julian ; but when she looked at him there was an expression on his countenance which almost terrified her ; it was as though the mortal powers had been brought face to face with an Immortal. He saw her look of questioning and anxiety, and attempted to laugh. \" I have been trying to paint with the sunbeams, as you told me,\" he said, \" and you see the blaze has bewildered my faculties. But you think it will do?\" \" Do ? \" said Mary. \" I wish I could tell you"], [137, "THE SEVENTH CARTOON. 129 what I think about it. And the odd thing is, that though it startled me with its supernatural look, there is something about it which seems familiar, as though I had seen that face in a dream.\" Geoffrey had felt the same kind of half recog nition, but the explanation seemed to him easy enough. Julian had been painting out of the image in his heart, and had conveyed to his can vas a reflection of Aurelia's features. It was not precisely a portrait, and yet in the look and ex pression the artist had certainly thrown something of that majestic calm which stamped Aurelia's beauty with its unearthly character. But Geoffrey did not feel at that moment disposed to suggest this explanation to his sister; though possibly it connected itself in some way or other with a heavy sigh which she heard just then beside her. The other members of the family were now summoned, and united in congratulating Mr. Wyvern on his success ; but Mary could not be satisfied till Aurelia and Father Segrave had been summoned to examine the completion of the car toon in which they had both taken so special an interest. So a note was despatched to the Castle begging for their appearance without delay, and an hour later Aurelia descended from her carriage. She found Mary lying in wait for her in the hall, ready to carry her off to the painting-room, in company with the chaplain. 1"], [138, "URIEL 130 They entered the apartment, and the easel supporting the picture stood exposed before their eyes. Aurelia looked at it for one moment ; but what was the surprise to those who stood around when she gave a cry of anguish, and covered her face with her hands as though she could not, dared not look again. Mary stood as one stupefied. \" Dear Aurelia,\" she said, passing her arm round her friend, \" what is it \u2014 what is amiss ? \" Aurelia lifted her head and pointed to the cartoon, \" It is himself,\" she said ; \" it is Uriel.\" Then turning to Julian : \" Where have you seen him to paint him thus ? \" \" I have, indeed, painted only what I have seen,\" said Julian. \" Then you have seen my lost brother,\" said Aurelia. \" Is it possible that he can yet be living ? \" \" God's ways are wonderful,\" said Geoffrey gravely, leading her to a chair. \" Sit down, Aurelia, and hear what Julian has to say : for you must tell it to her, Julian; \u2014 you must tell it to her, as you did to me. Perhaps there is something in it.\" Julian told his tale, and Aurelia listened with her eyes fixed on the picture in which the young man had depicted the form and features of his mysterious dehverer. \" If he whom you saw resembled that picture,\" she said, \" he must have been the living counter-"], [139, "THE SEVENTH CARTOON. 131 part of my poor brother. Nay, who can say ; \u2014 may it not have been himself ? \" \" But, dear Aurelia,\" said Mary, \" how could that be ? You know, we all know, the sad end which shut out all hope ? \" \" Shut out all hope, do you say ? \" said Aurelia, \" I have never given up hope, never. When I have prayed for him as dead, something in my heart has always told me that he might be living still.\" \" And you, Mr. Wyvern, how do you explain this strange affair ? \" said the chaplain, who seemed desirous of discouraging Aurelia from indulging in so hopeless a delusion. \" You have heard what Miss Pendragon says, and I confess the likeness is startling, though surely nothing more than accidental.\" Julian shook his head. \" I will say it here,\" he replied, \"though I would not care to say it to the world outside ; I do not believe the form I saw was that of mortal man. I believe it was an angel \u2014 his angel, perhaps \u2014 that took his form, or it may be, his patron, St. Uriel.\" There was a pause, which Geoffrey was the first to break. \" I am no judge of these things,\" he said, \" visions and pictures, and so forth ; but it seems to me there is an easy way of coming at the truth. The crew of the ' Speranza ' ought to know whom they had with them that night.\""], [140, "URIEL 132 \"No,\" said Julian, \"there is nothing to be learned from them. I went to Penmore and saw them all, with the exception of one fellow, a French fisherman, whose boat was in the bay at the time, having been driven in for shelter in the storm, and who had volunteered to join them. He left the next day, so I did not see him ; \u2014 but that,\" he continued, indicating the picture by a nod of the head, \" that was no St. Malo fisherman.\" \" You think so,\" said Father Adrian, \" because your feelings just then were highly wrought, and you saw everything through their medium. But the only probable solution of this mystery seems to me to lie in the supposition that you saw in your deliverer, and have again reproduced on jour canvas, the reflection of your own medita tions, which have not unnaturally been mingled of late with recollections of those old portraits of the Pendragons, where the family likeness is so singularly perpetuated. Ah, yes, I see, you think it a cold-blooded sort of explanation, but I have learned to know what strange tricks our imaginations will play us.\" \" I quarrel with no one for being incredulous of my word,\" said Julian ; \" for I have found it hard to trust my own impressions. I attempt no explanation, only this is certain ; what I saw I have painted.\""], [141, "THE SEVENTH CARTOON. 133 Aurelia looked at him with streaming eyes. \" Oh, that I had seen it too,\" she said ; \" those Seven Spirits ! how often I have longed to see them in their beauty ! And why may we not believe that it was one of them ? an angel, surely \u2014 his angel, perhaps, who took his form, to tell us that he still keeps guard over his client ! \" It was seldom that Aurelia spoke thus, and Mary, who saw that her friend had been power fully moved, proposed to accompany her back to the Castle, hoping that her feelings, pent up in the presence of others, might find relief when they were alone with one another. So they departed together; but for some reason Father Segrave did not accompany them. He saw them off, and then returned to the room where Geoffrey and Julian still remained. \" I hope I am not intruding on your time too long,\" he said ; \" but I want to hear more of that French fisherman.\" \" Oh, I can tell you nothing about him,\" re plied Julian ; \" the Penmore fellows said he was from St. Malo, and I did not give it another thought. What is in your mind ? You do not really think there is any ground for Miss Pen dragon's fancy about her brother being still alive?\" \" I don't know what to think,\" said Father Segrave. \" It is, as you say, a mere fancy, and"], [142, "URIEL 134 a most improbable one. But, poor child, her heart has always yearned over that unfortunate brother, whose guilt she never believed, and whose reputation, I believe, she would die to clear before the world.\" \" Did you yourself believe him guilty ? \" said Julian. \" I have never been able to get Geoffrey here to give an opinion beyond this, that there was much to be said on both sides.\" \" I suppose I am scarcely an impartial judge,\" said Father Segrave, \" for I knew and loved the lad from a youth, and never knew him to do a dishonourable thing ; though I sometimes thought that in this, perhaps, there was less of the fear of God than the scorn of disgracing the name of Pendragon. If so, he has paid a sad penalty for his pride, for through him the family has been dishonoured before the whole world. The case was briefly this : he had joined his regiment about a year, when the news came of a strange business which had taken place in the barracks where he was stationed. One of the officers, a Captain Redmond, was found in his room, as it seemed, mortally wounded by a pistol shot. The account he gave was not very intelligible, but he swore to some one having entered his room at night for the purpose of robbery. Awaking sud denly he had seen in the dim light a figure of unusual height, and springing from his bed to"], [143, "THE SEVENTH CARTOON. 135 grapple with the intruder, was shot down, and found lying senseless. When the place was examined it was discovered that the robber, whoever he might have been, had made off with a considerable sum of money, some in cash and some in notes. Every room in the barracks was searched, and some of the notes were found in Uriel's desk, though he solemnly declared they must have been placed there without his know ledge. I think this was the main evidence against him, and the circumstance of the robber being sworn to as of gigantic size, for Uriel was considerably above the ordinary height. Had Redmond died the poor fellow's life would have been forfeited ; as it was, his youth was put forth as a plea for mercy, and he escaped with five years of penal servitude, which, to one of his nature, must have been a living death. I will honestly confess the evidence against him never seemed to me sufficient. It was entirely circum stantial, and many important links were missing. The notes might, as he said, have been placed in his desk by the real criminal ; and Redmond made no attempt at identifying the person of his assailant. Ho spoke only of his great height, and among the privates of the regiment there was one, equally tall with Uriel, who was known to bear a grudge against him. Then again it was suggested that secret debts must have been"], [144, "136 URIEL the motive of the crime ; but after Uriel had been sent to Portland inquiries were set on foot with the view of liquidating any claims against him, but none were brought forward ; so that there is nothing to account for a youth in his position having been led to such a crime.\" \" And what view did his father take of the business ? \" said Julian ; \" because with such a poor show of evidence one would expect some effort would have been made \" \" I fear,\" replied the chaplain, \" that the sense of crushing disgrace predominated over every other feeling with Sir Michael : it all but turned his brain. I well remember the day when he knew that all was over ; and calling for holy relics, he held them in his hand, and swore, so long as this cloud rested on his house never again to touch aught but Lenten food, never to pass the boundary of his own enclosure, and never to give consent to his daughter's marriage, that he might not carry into any other family the stain of their terrible dishonour.\" \"How monstrous!\" said Julian, starting to his feet ; \"he might have sworn what he liked for himself, but what right had he to dispose of his daughter's freedom ? \" \" None in the least,\" said Father Segrave : \" nor do I consider that her freedom is in any way so bound. But if you knew the Pendragons"], [145, "THE SEVENTH CARTOON. 137 better, you would understand the old man's ex travagance, overstrained as it is.\" \" I never heard that part of it before,\" growled Geoffrey ; \" very like Jephte's daughter, I should say. And how did Aurelia take it ? \" \" Well, you know her,\" said Father Segrave ; \" she would never oppose her father's will ; and, to say the truth, I don't think she concerns her self much on the subject. Marmaduke Pendragon once tried to bring about an alliance with his eldest son, but she would never marry a Pro testant, even if her father's consent could have been obtained. The seclusion to which his stern resolve has for years condemned her has separated her from the ordinary thoughts and aspirations of girls of her age, who mix with the world. She lives apart, in a world and with aspirations of her own.\" Julian remained silent, as one in deep thought. \" So long as the cloud rests on his house, you say ; \u2014 if those are the terms of his oath it would imply that these preposterous restrictions would come to an end if the cloud were removed ? \" \" Of course,\" replied the chaplain. \" Then there is only one thing that can do that,\" continued Julian, \" to find Uriel, if indeed he be living, and clear him in the eyes of the world. Now honestly, do you think there is a shadow of possibility that he still survives ? \" \"You may judge for yourself,\" said the"], [146, "138 URIEL chaplain. \" We know positively that on the voyage to America he fell over the side of the vessel, towards evening, when it was growing dark. They threw over life-buoys, and lowered a boat, but the darkness came on, and they could do no more ; and nothing further was seen or heard of him from that hour. I own I do not see what reasonable ground there can be for in dulging a hope in such a case.\" \"Well,\" said Julian, \" there is no more to be said: only mark this, if he is yet alive, we will find him.\" The chaplain looked at him, half-pleased and half-perplexed. \" Ah well, Mr. Wyvern,\" he said, \" you are of the age of ardent hopes and generous enterprises. May God give you success in what you undertake, and may the holy angels lend their aid ! \" \" Amen,\" said Julian gravely. \" Believe me, it is not for nothing that their old sanctuary is being restored. Two months ago, I believe my notions about the angels did not greatly differ from those avowed by Paxton ; but my work for Merylin Chapel has taught me many things ; and when I stood on the wreck the other night, it was from the bottom of my heart that I invoked their aid.\" \" And your prayer was heard,\" said the chap lain : \" whoever your deliverer was, the fact re mains that you were delivered, and to God and His holy angels be the praise ! \""], [147, "139 CHAPTER XIII. AN EXHIBITION. As the excitement caused by the first appearance of Julian's cartoon began to subside most parties satisfied themselves that there was nothing in it but \" a singular coincidence ; \" and if any among them still clung to the belief that there was a deeper significance in the incident, either natural or supernatural, they were prudent enough to say nothing more on the subject. Julian himself did not recur to it, but a certain change was apparent in him which did not escape the notice of his friend. There was a gravity and thoughtfulness in his demeanour which to Geof frey's thinking had its explanation in the facts which had lately come to their knowledge as to the singular position in which Aurelia was placed by her father's vow. \"I see it all,\" said Geoffrey to himself, \"he feels that as things are it is useless for him to aspire to her hand ; \u2014 ah, well, it makes no odds"], [148, "URIEL 140 to me. It is not more impossible for me to think of her now than it has ever been. But I am sorry for Julian.\" Then it occurred to him to ask himself how it might be with Aurelia herself? If, as he had every reason for thinking, she had allowed Julian to gain an interest in her heart, the only way of removing the bar to her happiness was the vindi cation of Uriel's memory. \"If he is dead, he is dead,\" thought Geoffrey, \" and all the wishing in the world will not bring him to life again. But, if he were innocent, his innocence might yet be proved, and then \" What then, good Geoffrey ? What thought is it which expands his breast and illuminates his eye, as though a noble purpose was rising in his heart, a purpose high enough and hard enough to make his life heroic ? for no truer word was ever spoken than that which proclaimed that in every man living in this world who is ready, \" not to sell his life, but to give it, there exists the poten tiality of a hero.\" * It was the conviction, per haps, that something more was being offered to his acceptance at that moment than the conscien tious discharge of his common duties. Not a bad thing either, and by no means too common ; yet admitting of something higher, perhaps even lead ing the way thereto, as we ascend by gentle slopes, * Carlyle : \" Past and Present.\""], [149, "AN EXHIBITION. 141 until a height is reached whence through scarped rocks and eternal snows we push our way to the summit. \" So the cartoons are all finished,\" said Ger trude, as that evening they all gathered round the family hearth, \" and we shall lose the delight ful interest of hearing day by day that Sealthiel has got a new wing, or that an additional emblem has been found for Jehudiel.\" \"Yes,\" replied Julian, \"absolutely finished; and, as a rigid, and to me sorrowful consequence, the artist has no resource but to pack his port manteau and be off.\" \" But not till his work has been exhibited and approved,\" said Gertrude ; \" we have seen them only one by one ; now to judge them properly you should show them to us altogether, and in their proper order. You can't judge of a thing piecemeal.\" \" That is a good idea,\" said Julian, \" for they are only parts of a whole, and ought to have a sort of harmony connecting them. They shall be set up to-morrow, and if the judges will honour my painting-room \" \" Oh no, that will never do,\" said Gertrude. \" If I am to be one of the judges (as I hope you intend), I shall vote for a better exhibition-room than that. Seven angels crowded together in a space eight feet by ten ! it would be giving them"], [150, "URIEL 142 no chance. You should have them in a great gallery, and not too close together.\" \"As usual, Gerty,\" said her brother, \"your notions are fitter for Swinburne than for Laventor. You must not look for galleries in an old manor house.\" \"Well, but why not have them at Merylin, where they will have to go sooner or later,\" said Gertrude ; \" in the great gallery there we could all see them, and criticise at our ease.\" Gertrude's proposal was agreed to be an in spiration, and Julian declared he would apply the very next morning for Miss Pendragon's consent. It was willingly granted, and the cartoons, care fully mounted, were as carefully conveyed to the Castle and fixed at equal distances in the great gallery, awaiting the inspection of the judges. No one was more pleased with this arrange ment than Mdlle. de St. Brieuc, as it promised, for one morning, at least, to add an enlivening element to the society of the Castle, which, to con fess the truth, she found more sad and solemn than was to her taste. She petitioned hard to be nominated assistant to Mr. Wyvern in the im portant business of hanging his pictures. She invaded Sir Michael in his solitary chamber, and tried to induce him to attend the trial ; in short, she who had not been a fortnight in the house succeeded in upsetting its ordinary routine, and"], [151, "AN EXHIBITION. 143 carrying out her own plans and arrangements after a fashion that none of the oldest inhabit ants of Merylin would have dared to dream of. But on one point \" Monsieur Jules \" showed him self inflexible \u2014 neither she, nor any other of the judges should enter the gallery, until all the car toons were in their places, and the exhibition was declared open. Imogen was forced to submit, assuring Julian, however, that he was the very first person who had ever contradicted her, and that he should certainly be the last. At length the artist's arrangements were com plete, and the judges, consisting of the two families of Laventor and Merylin, were admitted to the gallery. The aptness of Gertrude's proposal at once became apparent, for in point of fact the pictures proved to be a group, in which three angels were ranged on either side of St. Michael, as the central figure ; and the separate inspection of each figure would have conveyed no idea of their power and significance when seen together. First came Barachiel, \" the Helper,\" with the folds of his mantle filled with white roses ; then Jehudiel, \" the Remunerator,\" holding in one hand a crown, and in the other a scourge ; next to him St. Gabriel, with his lily, whilst St. Michael stood conspicuous as a glorious warrior, with sword and armour, and red cross banner displayed. On his left hand was St. Raphael, with kind and"], [152, "URIEL 144 friendly countenance leading the young Tobias by the hand. There was a homely, human char acter in this figure, which distinguished it from the rest, and which made the contrast all the greater as the eye turned to the next cartoon, and was almost startled at the flashing, burning radi ance which surrounded St. Uriel, \" the Strong Companion,\" \" the Light and Fire of God,\" with a sword in his right hand, and living flames in his left. Last of all came Sealthiel, \" the Angel of Prayer,\" with clasped hands, and his whole attitude that of humble petition, like a final key note in the glorious chord, reminding the be holders that by the hands of the holy angels the prayers of all saints are offered before the throne of God* A hush fell on the assembled party, as they passed from one to another of the angelic figures thus displayed. They hardly seemed a subject for criticism, for in presence of the spiritual power which Julian had thrown into his work, the proportion of limb and feature, and the mingling of colours, seemed to fade away out of mind. The place too had its own solemnity, and the wind which sighed through the old gallery and waved the tapestry on the walls seemed just then more fitting music than the sound of human voices. * Apocal. viii. 3. Tob. xii. 12."], [153, "AN EXHIBITION. 145 Imogen was the first to speak. \" Your judges are very silent, Monsieur Jules,\" she said ; \"do you not tremble what their sentence may be?\" He made no answer, but looked at Aurelia, who gave a sigh of relief, as one who had held her breath under some absorbing emotion. \" Do not ask me, Mr. Wyvern,\" she said ; \" I have forgotten all about the cartoons, and was thinking of the angels.\" \" That is the most flattering criticism you could deliver,\" said Father Adrian ; \"an artist who makes his judges feel in presence of the realities he has tried to represent, so that they forget both him and his representations, has achieved his end.\" \" He has indeed,\" said Julian. \"If that proves to be the effect of my pictures when they are finished, I shall be well content.\" \" Barachiel is charming,\" said Imogen ; \" but I have been trying in vain to find a meaning in his roses.\" \" He is ' the Helper,' \" said Father Adrian ; \" but his name really means ' he who blesses God.' \" \" Ah, I see,\" said Imogen ; \" then the roses are the symbols of joy and cheerfulness, which are the real helpers through life. I shall choose him for my angel. Jehudiel, with his crown and K"], [154, "146 URIEL scourge, will better suit you, Mademoiselle Aurelie ; he seems to say as he holds them out, ' Consent to suffer, and be crowned ! ' ' \"That,\" said Gertrude, \"is too high a flight for me ; but St. Gabriel, with his lily and the Ave on his lips, looks like an old friend.\" \"And you, Miss Houghton,\" said Julian to Mary, \" have you no preference among my angels, or are they just pictures to you and nothing more r She smiled, and putting her arm within her brother's, led him to the fifth cartoon. \" Geoffrey and I have the same attractions in most things,\" she said, \" and St. Raphael, the kind, human hearted angel, shall be our patron, shall he not, Geoffrey ? But I wonder, Mr. Wyvern,\" she con tinued, \" what reason you had for placing him between the splendour of St. Michael and the dazzling blaze of St. Uriel. It makes him look very rustic in comparison ; but' that is just what suits us best.\" \" I believe,\" replied Julian, \" that I meant to give a lesson to my critics. Nine out of ten of them will care nothing for my poor St. Raphael, in his russet cloak and pilgrim's staff; but it is so I like to think of the ' faithful guide to them that have lost their way.' Angels are not entirely made up of gold and jewels.\" At that moment an exclamation from Imogen"], [155, "AN EXHIBITION. 147 made them turn their heads. In company with Gertrude she had found her way to the picture of St. Uriel, and at once recognised its resem blance to the \"grand homme bleu\" of the ship wreck. It was his very look ; M. Jules must have drawn it from memory, she was sure ; \" perhaps,\" she added, \" he meant it as a memo rial of that event, and a thank-offering for their deliverance.\" A gesture from Julian imposed silence on those of the company who were in the secret of the cartoon. He affected not to see the likeness which Imogen had pointed out, but he could not shake her in her opinion. \" It is altogether amazing,\" she said ; \" if it were but dressed in the blue Guernsey and big boots of the fisherman, it might stand for his portrait.\" The evidence was conclusive. Julian and the chaplain exchanged looks, and the former briefly observed, \" You see.\" \" Yes,\" said Father Adrian, as he drew the young man away, \" and you will take notice that it teas a fisherman.\" \" As you will,\" replied Julian, \" fisherman or no fisherman, it was a real face, and no ima- gination.\" \" I grant it,\" said the chaplain ; \" but now the question still remains, who that fisherman was.\""], [156, "148 URIEL They all left the gallery together, and going forth into the garden, a general leave-taking en sued. Mdme. de St. Brieuc and her daughter had fixed their departure for the day following, and were profuse in their compliments to Julian, and their earnest expression of a hope that he would one day visit them in Brittany. Julian was also departing on the morrow ; he had put everything in Gules' hands, and would leave his own cartoons under Aurelia's care, to be executed when the works in the chapel were sufficiently advanced, which would not be for many months to come. Aurelia promised they should be carefully seen to, and Julian added, \" I wish, how I wish, I dared to trust you with something yet more precious ! \" She looked an interrogation, then taking advantage of the moment when the St. Brieuc party were engaging the attention of the other bystanders, he led her aside, and seemed to be pouring out his heart with earnest solicitude. Geoffrey followed them with his eyes, and observed Aurelia's calm countenance, listening with fixed attention. As they returned on their steps, Julian still speaking in low emphatic tones, Geoffrey caught his closing words : \"If you could promise me so much, I should be happy indeed,\" and her reply : \"I do promise ; you may trust me faithfully.\""], [157, "AN EXHIBITION. \" 149 Poor Geoffrey pulled his hat tighter over his eyes and turned away.

Julian was gone, and the countess and her daughter also had departed for Brittany. Life both at Merylin and Laventor was returning into its old channels, the same, yet how unlike the same ! In vain to say when some great wave has passed over us, that we will be as in days gone by, and that all shall go on with us as it did before. That wave will have left its fertilis ing or its desolating work behind it, and the fields over which its waters have flowed can never be quite the same again. It was not the same to Geoffrey, to whom Julian's visit had brought new experiences and a deeper insight into his own heart. Into his tran quil life of quiet home interests there had intruded some sharp pangs and bitter struggles. Neither could it ever again be the same to Mary, though she was angry with herself for finding that the intercourse which for two months had shed such a charm over their family circle had, by its with-"], [159, "NEWS OF JULIAN. 151 drawal, left behind a woful blank. Geoffrey saw and understood something of what she was feel ing ; and though there was no further talk of eagles and sparrows, they felt that there was another tie of unspoken sympathy between them, and it drew them closer together than before. Meanwhile Geoffrey's own mind was busy de vising scheme after scheme for investigating anew the evidence concerning Uriel's guilt, and obtain ing further light on the subject. The point on which he had fixed as affording the only likeli hood of opening a new view of the case was the mention which had been made by the chaplain of a soldier in Uriel's regiment, whose height was as remarkable as his own, and who was said to have borne a grudge against the youth. On reference to a report of the trial he found that the man in question was a certain Joe Morton, the son of one of Sir Michael's former tenants, who considered himself aggrieved when his land lord refused to renew his lease, and had vowed revenge. Joe, a wild slip of the family, had enlisted in the regiment in which Uriel soon after obtained his commission, and having on more than on one occasion got himself into trouble, through misconduct, he attributed his frequent visitations of punishment to the ill-will of the young man who, as he supposed, had pre judiced his commanding officer against him."], [160, "URIEL 152 Geoffrey further ascertained that since the affair of the robbery Morton had got his discharge ; and a long and weary course of inquiry enabled him to track the man through many an alias and many a conviction for crimes and misdemeanours, and to establish the probability of his having re turned to his native county about a year previous to the present date. All this information was not obtained without expenditure of time, trouble, and patience. Good Mrs. Houghton wondered not a little at the frequent journeys undertaken by her son, now to Exeter, now to Bristol, and now to Plymouth. The explanations he gave of agricultural meetings, or exhibitions of machinery, appeared to her highly unsatisfactory, and she did not conceal from her daughters her conviction that Geoffrey had been thoroughly upset by Mr. Wyvern's visit. \" You know, my dears,\" she said one evening, when the subject of her anxiety had pleaded \" business \" as excuse for a sudden departure for Truro, where the assizes were being held, \" Mr. Wyvern is a very clever man, and I have never denied it. It's all in character for him to be going about the world restoring chapels and set ting up life-boats. But I wish he had not in fected Geoffrey with those restless ways.

Aurelia has actually had a threatening letter, warning her not to go to a particular cottage at Penmore, where she has been visiting a poor girl, Clara Fagan, in typhus fever. She showed it to Geoffrey, and he thinks it must be from one of the Penmore gang, who are afraid of her being a spy on them.\" \" How dreadful,\" said Gertrude ; \" and has she been there since ? \" \" I believe she went the next day,\" said Mary ; \" you know Aurelia does not understand what fear means ; but Geoffrey says she must not go again, and must send her relief to the girl some other way.\" The facts were much as Mary had stated them, but neither she nor Aurelia were aware that Geoffrey's special interest in the smugglers of Penmore arose from the circumstance that he had succeeded in tracking Morton to that neighbour hood, and had every reason for believing that he was a member of the gang. Assisted by the police and coast-guard authorities he had been for some time engaged in watching their haunts and preparing to take them by surprise, and the letter received by Aurelia confirmed him in his suspicion that the house to which she had paid"], [163, "NEWS OF JULIAN. 155 her charitable visits was the resort of some of their leaders. Meanwhile what had become of Julian ? His friends at Merylin and Laventor were be ginning to ask themselves this question, for though for some time after his departure he had reported his movements pretty regularly, weeks had now passed and were slipping into months since any tidings had been received from him. The Holmes-Abbotts had gone to London for the rigorous duties of the season, so no information came from that quarter. From time to time Aurelia communicated to Mary such intelligence as she had heard through Mr. Gules, and seemed to be solicitous in trying to believe, and making others believe, that there was nothing extra ordinary in his silence. Geoffrey, who at rare intervals received a hasty note, containing some directions regarding the chapel, with the briefest possible notice of the writer's own doings and whereabouts, made the most of these despatches when speaking to Aurelia ; but in the secret of their hearts they both felt that there was some thing that called for explanation. One morning, however, the post-bag brought Geoffrey a letter from no other than Lady Annabel Abbott. Opening it over the breakfast-table, with a certain growl of annoyance, he found it to con tain certain commissions connected with some of"], [164, "156 URIEL Lady Annabel's multifarious undertakings, in which she wished to engage Mr. Houghton's kind interest and co-operation. The growl was renewed at intervals as he waded through the effusive feminine composition ; but as he turned the page and read the postscript it was exchanged for an exclamation of surprise. \" What is it, Geff? \" said Gertrude ; \" is'there any news of Mr. Wyvern ? \" \" Why \u2014 yes,\" replied Geoffrey. \" He's in Brittany ; has been there three weeks.\" \"In Brittany ! \" exclaimed Gertrude ; \"with the St. Brieuc people, no doubt.\" \" Exactly so,\" rephed Geoffrey. \" I won der \" \" I don't wonder in the least,\" said Gertrude. \" You know, they invited him the day before they left.

Now don't go and put that about, Gerty ; he's no more thinking of it than I am.\" \" Very well,\" replied Gertrude ; \" not that I see why he should not think of it, if it so pleases him ; and if you won't be angry at my saying so, he never was the same after that affair of the wreck : from that day he had the air, to my mind, of one e'perdument dpris.\""], [165, "NEWS OF JULIAN. 157 \" What does Lady Annabel say ? \" inquired Mary, very calmly ; \" is it private, or might one see ? \" Geoffrey pushed the note towards her and went on with his breakfast, with a certain savageness of demeanour. Gertrude looked over her sister's shoulder and read aloud the momentous post script : \" P.S. \u2014We have not heard from dear Julian since he went to Brittany, three weeks ago. His prospect of happiness at St. Brieuc seems to have put everything and everybody else out of his head. He has written to Paxton ; only two lines, but quite in transports. She is of good family, I am told ; but I should have preferred an Eng lish alliance.\" \" Not very clear,\" said Mary composedly, but for some reason or other feeling as if every one was looking as her, and wondering what she thought of it ; \"I daresay he will tell us more about it himself.\" \" I tell you, I don't believe a word of it,\" said Geoffrey, rising from the table, and thrusting the letter into his pocket, as though he owed it a grudge. \" He's gone to Brittany to shoot, or to fish, or to sketch, or something. It's not that.\" And so saying, he left the apartment. A few minutes later a great bang of the hall door seemed to indicate that he had gone out ;"], [166, "158 URIEL and the bang had a character about it that be tokened a ruffled mood in the outgoing party. \" How savage our dear Geff can be when he tries,\" said Gertrude ; \" and he tries so seldom that it has a certain charm of novelty about it. Why should not Mr. Wyvern end his romance in the most natural of all ways ? Rodolph declares that after such an adventure as that of the ' Speranza ' the thing was inevitable.\" Meanwhile, Geoffrey was endeavouring to work off his irritation in the open air ; and after turn ing the matter over in his mind he bethought him of applying to Mr. Gules, to ascertain if there were any truth in the main fact stated by Lady Annabel of Julian's visit to Brittany. Three weeks ago had been the precise date of his last letter to Geoffrey, in which not the smallest allusion was made to any such plan, and this of itself seemed unaccountable. He took the road, therefore, to Meryhn Chapel, where the works were being actively carried on, and where, as he expected, he found Gules in attendance. Yes, Gules had heard from Mr. Wyvern, a week, no, a fortnight ago ; he was in Brittany, certainly, at the Chateau de St. Brieuc ; and seemed much preoccupied. \" I shall not be able to write again for some httle time,\" he wrote, \" having an affair on my hands which engages all my attention.\" \"Those are his words,\" said"], [167, "NEWS OF JULIAN. 159 Gules, \" he doesn't say more ; but there are rumours, perhaps you may have heard them, of his approaching marriage.\" \" Absurd ! \" said Geoffrey, \" I should not like that story to get abroad. There is not a shadow of truth in it. Mr. Wyvern's business in Brittany is of another kind, altogether, you may rely on it.\" The words escaped his lips before he was aware that Aurelia was standing by his side. She had come to the chapel to watch the progress of the work, according to her daily wont, and had approached the spot where Geoffrey stood, with out his having perceived her entrance. \" Is Mr. Wyvern in Brittany ? \" asked Aurelia, in surprise ; \" has he written to you ? \" \" No,\" said Geoffrey shortly. He was wholly inexperienced in evasion, and his resolution not to communicate any injurious reports to Aurelia did not avail to prevent him from exhibiting a most inconvenient confusion of manner. Then he bethought him that the idle rumours of which Gules had spoken would certainly reach her ears, and that it might be better for her to hear of them from one who would at the same time qualify the impressions they might convey. \" I heard it from Lady Annabel,\" he said, \" and dressed up, needless to say, with plenty of gossip. He is at the Chateau de St. Brieuc, and has been there three weeks.\""], [168, "160 URIEL \"And he never wrote to you himself?\" said Aurelia ; \" how strange ! \u2014 don't you think so ? \" \" I don't know,\" said Geoffrey ; \" he wasn't bound. He is after some of his own hobbies, I fancy ; lifeboats or paintings, matters of that sort.\" \" And the gossip,\" said Aurelia ; \" it connected his name with that of Imogen de St. Brieuc, I presume ? \" \" Who cares for gossip ? \" was Geoffrey's not very straightforward reply. \" Not I, certainly,\" said Aurelia ; \" but one cares for \u2014 well \u2014 for consistency, for fidelity.\" \" I am as certain of Julian's fidelity as of my own,\" said Geoffrey earnestly. \" Appearances are against him ; but what is the worth of friendship if not to trust ? \" \" Amen to that, with all my heart,\" replied Aurelia ; \" and a friend's trust is not to be blown away by every idle rumour. But if it were as they say, I confess \u2014 for his sake \u2014 I should be sorry.\" She spoke with dignity, but without a particle of wounded feeling. Geoffrey felt puzzled, perhaps the least in the world disappointed, at the way she took it. It was a comfort, certainly, that she would not be broken-hearted at Julian's defection, if, indeed, the report were true ; but at the same time, it was mortifying to think that, perhaps,"], [169, "NEWS OF JULIAN. 161 after all, Aurelia was too stately and too self contained to have any heart to break. But no, that would be misdoubting Aurelia ; a worse crime in his eyes than even mistrust of his friend. For, in truth, there was in Geoffrey's soul that character of true chivalry, \" which needs not the gilded spur or knightly oath \" to make its owner cling to fidelity, as to some sacred obliga tion. No, he did not understand what seemed the state of the case between these two beings, to him the worthiest in the world ; only until forced to own himself deceived he must continue to believe that Julian was true, and Aurelia worthy of his devotion. He took his leave, promising to let her know when he should hear from Julian, to whom he secretly resolved to write, and, stating what was currently reported, obtain his own explanation. With this resolve he turned his steps in tthe direction of home, intending to write and despatch his letter without delay. But home he was not destined to return that day, which, unknown to him, held within it the unravelling of many a thread connected with the fortunes of Merylin. I."], [170, "162 CHAPTER XV. STIRRING SCENES. Geoffrey's absence during the day excited no remark at Laventor, as his ordinary avocations, whether agricultural or magisterial, often so fully engaged him that nothing was seen of him from breakfast to dinner. But when the dinner-hour came, and still no Geoffrey appeared, the exception to his generally infallible punctuality was felt as an alarming domestic phenomenon. Very reluctantly, and after waiting for the best part of an hour, they sat down without him, and had hardly done so when a note was brought in and delivered to Mrs. Houghton. It appeared hastily written, and contained only the following words : \u2014 \"Deae Mother, \u2014 Have been unexpectedly detained at Tremadoc all day. Must be at Pen more to-night. Don't expect me till you see me. All right. G. H.\""], [171, "STIRRING SCENES. 163 \" How unaccountable! \" exclaimed Mrs. Hough ton ; \" who brought the note, Davis ? \" A coastguard man, I should say he was,\" rephed Davis, the old butler ; \" I made bold to ask where master was, and he says as how by this time, he takes it, he will be at Penmore, having set off an hour ago with Captain Linde say.\" \" Something more about the smugglers,\" said Mary. \" Don't be anxious, mamma ; you see, he goes under ample protection.\" Needless to say, however, Mrs. Houghton felt it a strict part of her maternal duty to be exceed ingly anxious, and to spend most of the evening in vain conjectures as to Geoffrey's business, and equally vain regrets that he should have started for Penmore without carpet-bag or portmanteau. Anxiety and curiosity, however, were both at fault, nor did the early post next morning bring anything to throw light upon the mystery. But about ten o'clock an unusual visitor was announced in the person of Mr. Lindesay, the Vicar of Tremadoc, of whose powers as a teller of legends an example has been given in a former chapter ; and whose brother was the \" Captain Lindesay \" mentioned above, the officer in com mand at the coastguard station of Tremadoc. Although on neighbourly terms with Geoffrey and his family, yet his visits were sufficiently rare to"], [172, "164 URIEL make his appearance on this particular morning premonitory of something uncommon. \" I feared,\" he began, \" lest you might have heard rumours of last night's affair at Penmore, and so have felt uneasy.

He has been indefatigable in hunting out these fellows, and it seems my brother having received some tresh information yesterday, on which it was necessary to act without a moment's delay, sent a messenger in search of Mr. Houghton, and pressed him to accompany them, thinking the presence of a magistrate might prove necessary if things became serious. But he is perfectly safe ; you need have no fear about him,\" he con tinued, observing Mrs. Houghton looking aghast and bewildered ; \" here is my brother's note; \" and he read as follows : \u2014"], [173, "STIRRING SCENES. 165 \" Dear J., \u2014 All over, and a first-rate job.

But he did not appear, only about mid-day came a mounted messenger in haste, who left a letter, and said he was bound for the Castle, but that on his way back he would call for what Mr. Houghton wanted. The letter was to Mary, and ran as follows : \u2014 \" Dear Mary, \u2014 Lindesay will have told you of the scrimmage here.

Accounts varied, but all agreed in representing that the plan of surprise had been wholly devised, and partly carried out by Mr. Houghton, and his coolness and promptitude were extolled by all. \" It is pleasant to hear old Geoffrey praised,\" said Gertrude, \" though I should as soon have expected him to distinguish himself in a ballroom as on a battlefield.\" \" No, indeed,\" said Mary ; \" if it had been Mr. Wyvern \" \" Oh, of course, if it had been Mr. Wyvern, fighting single-handed against ten giants with two heads each, would have been quite apropos.

JULIAN'S. DISCOVERY. Not until the second day after his departure did Geoffrey reappear at Laventor, and then only to announce that he could stay but half an hour, as he had pressing business at the Castle. He was received with pardonable enthusiasm by his two sisters. \" Business or no business,\" said Gertrude, \" you do not stir hence until you have reported yourself to mamma. You are becoming a regular Brutus, Geoffrey ; setting the defence of your country against Bill Fagan & Co. above your natural affections.\" \" Poor Bill Fagan ! \" said Geoffrey gravely ; \" the country has nothing more to fear from him. He died this morning.\" \" Was it Clara's father,\" said Mary, \" the girl whom Aurelia nursed at Penmore ? \" \" Yes,\" said Geoffrey ; \" a wonderful business altogether. His name wasn't Bill Fagan, you"], [177, "JULIAN'S DISCOVERY. 169 know. They carried him to his own cottage when he was hit, and his daughter did what she could for him. He has . confessed everything ; but I'll tell you about that to-morrow.\" Mrs. Houghton received her son as a mother might be expected to do who had endured eight and-forty hours' suspense, with no more than the confused impression that he had been in danger, and had shown himself a hero. Geoffrey laughed, and bade them not be in a flutter. \" They have told you a lot of lies, I'll be bound,\" he said ; \" you shall hear it all this even ing, from one end to the other, only don't keep me now, there's good people, for I'm bound to be at the Castle.\" He was in such evident impatience to be off that even Mary for a moment felt aggrieved. It seemed so hard that after such a serious adven ture his first interest should be at the Castle and not at home. \" But you will look at your letters first? \" she said ; \"sit there, and I will bring them. There is one from \u2014 Brittany.\" \" Ah,\" said Geoffrey, tearing open the envelope, and rapidly glancing his eye over the contents, \"so he has written at last.

She took it with trembling hands, but her voice failed her when she began to read, and she cast a pitiful look towards Gertrude. \" Give it to me,\" said her sister ; \" you are no better hand at reading writing than Geoffrey is. What a packet ! \" she added, glancing at the well-filled pages. \" Now listen, all of you, to the third volume of the Wyvern romance : \u2014 \" ' Dear Geoffrey, \u2014 You have been wondering at my silence, and a dozen times a day during the last three weeks I've wished to write, only it seemed better to wait till I could speak for certain. I was afraid of any wind of the business getting to Merylin, and didn't feel sure if you were equal to keeping a secret. Well, it is all out now. Uriel is alive. Aurelia was right, and I was right too, in a way, for it was he whom we saw on the night of the shipwreck. From the moment Imogen recognised his likeness in the cartoon, I felt sure that the French fisherman was really the man, and had no peace till I could"], [179, "JULIANS DISCOVERY. 171 get upon his track. But no end of business that had accumulated, while I was busy with the cartoons, had to be got through before I could leave England. When I wrote to you three weeks ago, I saw no prospect of being able to do so, but, a day or so after, there came a letter from the St. Brieuc people which at once decided me. Would you believe it that Imogen had taken it into her head herself to set on foot a search for \"our deliverer,\" as she calls him? She had got together a lot of information about tall fishermen with yellow hair, who, if you were to believe her report, were waiting for examina tion in every port from Nantes to St. Malo ; and she and her mother begged I would come and pay them my promised visit, while, at the same time, I could help in the search after the \" grand homme bleu.\" So, to make a long story short, I went, and had a most hospitable reception. I shall not take up your time with descriptions of scenery and French chateaux, none of which can hold a candle to Laventor (to say nothing of Merylin). As to the coast, it is almost as fan tastic as your own, and the wrecks about as numerous. They have lifeboats, too, and, of course, I could not keep myself from inspecting them. None to compare with our own \" Snowdon patent,\" but good enough in their way, and with fine crews to man them."], [180, "URIEL 172 \" ' Now, on a certain day I had gone to a place called St. Florian, to look at a boat, which was reported to have done great things in the way of saving life ; and asking some questions about the crew, I learned that amongst them was a \" big Englishman,\" who was supposed to have saved more lives than any other single man in the pro vince. \" An Englishman ? what was his name?\" It seemed odd that any English sailor should have a fancy for living in a French fishing-village. They could not tell me his English name ; he had one, they said, but no one could pronounce it : the name they knew him by was Archange, which had been commonly given him after he had made the pilgrimage to Mont St. Michel. Now, Geoffrey, when I heard the name something went through me that told me I had found the man. I bade them tell me all about him, and learned that he had come about seven years previously, no one knew exactly why or whence. He gave himself out as an Englishman and a carpenter, and, in fact, he followed that trade, though he kept a fishing-boat also, and feared neither wind nor weather. About a year after he had settled there he married a young peasant girl \u2014 a Jac queline something or other \u2014 the village beauty. They had lived happily together for a year, but she died at the birth of her first child \u2014 le petit Uriel \u2014 a charming little angel, who was his"], [181, "JULIAN'S DISCOVERY. 173 father's darling. That was enough, and it was with my heart beating hard, Geoffrey, that I asked one of them to guide me to his cottage. \" ' It was a queer little place, some way up the cliff, overlooking the sea, with a rough sort of carpenter's yard on one side, whence, as we drew near, I heard the sound of blows as from an axe or hatchet. I dismissed my companion with a small gratuity, and drew near quietly that I might observe the workman, whoever he might be, at my ease. A man stood before me, of gigantic stature, wielding a mighty axe, as if it had been a feather. I had but a moment to admire his noble figure and well-set head, when the sound of my footsteps caught his ear, and, leaning on his axe, he turned to see who was approaching. As he did so, his cap fell from his head, and at that moment the beams of the western sun fell on his countenance and illumined his golden hair. Impossible to forget that coun tenance ! and without waiting for more I sprang into the yard, exclaiming aloud : \" Uriel ! Uriel!\" \" Plait-il ? \" said a child's sweet voice beside me, \" me void done, voici le petit Uriel ! \" I looked down, and beheld a little fairy figure, with sunny hair and violet eyes \u2014 a boy, who had been playing among the chips, as he watched his father at his work, and who, hearing his own name called, had answered to my cry. It did"], [182, "URIEL 174 not take many minutes for me to tell my tale. I spoke of the wreck of the French steamer at Tremadoc, and the rescue of the passengers by the crew of the \" Speranza ; \" of my desire to find out the stranger who had that night joined their number, to whom, as I beheved, I owed my life, and whom I could not doubt I now saw before me. But when I named Sir Michael and Merylin, and told him how the rescued passengers had been taken there and cared for, and how every one at the castle had heard of the brave man who had done this gallant deed, he could not stand it, but sat leaning forward and covering his face with his hands. I went up to him, and laid my hand on his shoulder : \" Uriel Pendragon,\" I said. He started, and looked up. \" There is no room for concealment,\" I continued ; \" you are he, and you cannot deny it.\" \" ' No, he could not deny it ; I sat down beside him, and ho told me all.

You will think it a super stition, perhaps : all I can tell you is that in my bitter loneliness I turned to them for aid and comfort, and they did not fail me. It was the thought of them that brought me back to trust in God ; I do believe that they offered my poor prayers in their golden censers ; until I came to see with what mercy I had been stricken down in my pride, and torn out of my place in the false and fleeting world, the love of which would have been my destruction.\" Then he went on to tell me of his release from Portland and his departure for America. It was only the second day after they sailed that the accident happened of which we heard. He fell overboard, and felt the waters close above his head, as he thought for ever ; but rising to the surface again he was able to grasp one of the life-buoys they had thrown over, and kept himself afloat till he was"], [184, "176 URIEL picked up by a vessel homeward bound. At his own request he was landed somewhere on the Cornish coast, and begged his way as far as Penmore. No one recognised in the poor ragged vagrant the unfortunate heir of Merylin, and he was able to make inquiries without attracting suspicion. The tale he heard seemed to shut out all hope of restoration in this world. Sir Michael, he was told, had solemnly cursed his son, and sworn never to see his face again. He heard his father spoken of as a moody maniac, whose strange fits of melancholy madness made men avoid the neighbourhood of Merylin with a sort of terror. \" I knew,\" he said, \" that they now believed me dead \u2014 and dead, indeed, I was to all that this world could give. My reappear ance among them could only be a renewal of their bitter disgrace, the reopening of a deadly wound. I felt the kindest thing for me to do was to fade out of the memory of all men, and to let the report of my death remain for ever uncon tradicted. So I found my way hither, and have lived a not unhappy life. If the sin of my house and family has been a guilty pride, in my deep humiliation it has now been expiated, and I may, perhaps, be the last of the Golden-Haired Pen dragons who shall bear the doom of misfortune.\" \" And you can bear this life,\" I said ; \"and per severe in it ? \" \" Yes, Mr. Wyvern,\" he said,"], [185, "JULIANS DISCOVERY. 177 smiling ; \" God has been good to me, and given me something to live for.\" I looked at the child, who was playing at our feet. \" Ah, yes,\" said his father, lifting him to his knee, \" he, too, is a gift, my angel gift, as I like to call him : all that is left me of my poor Jacqueline.

In lifeboat service, in which I have taken part ever since I came to this country, / have found my call. Most of those who devote themselves to this work would tell you the same. It is not a profession, but a voca tion. They feel, one and all, that they have a call from God to save life, and that they must answer to that call. When it came to me in my lonely widowhood it roused my heart to a new courage, and made me content to live that I might spend my life in saving others. So now, when the storm gathers and the billows break, it sounds to me hke a voice summoning me to the post of danger. It was so I felt that night at Penmore, where I had been driven in for shelter : stranger as I was, I could not have kept back from joining the crew of the ' Speranza.' \" \" ' You see, Geoffrey, he is a noble soul, this poor lost Uriel ; but, alas ! he will not declare himself.

You see it was to be a secret unless his innocence was proved, and the proof of that I hold this moment in my pocket.\" \" You ? \" exclaimed Mary. \" Yes, I,\" replied Geoffrey ; \" it is, as I said, an amazing business. Bill Fagan, as they called him, was not Bill Fagan at all ; he was Joseph Morton, the trooper in Uriel's regiment, who really committed the crime for which the poor fellow was condemned. He confessed the whole to me last night, when he knew he was dying, and I"], [187, "JULIANS DISCOVERY. 179 took down the deposition from his lips, and had it properly attested. Uriel is innocent, and this paper will prove it to the whole world.\" There was but one thing for Mary to do on bearing this explanation ; she threw her arms round her brother's neck, and fairly hugged him. Then, being a woman, she laid her head on his shoulder, and cried for joy. So many feelings were clamouring in her heart for the mastery, but, perhaps, for the moment the uppermost one was a sense of honest pride in her dear old Geoffrey. And Julian, too, he had his share in it all; they divided the palm between them. \" Well, now then,\" said Geoffrey, \" you see why I was in a hurry to go to the Castle. I wanted to tell Aurelia ; but, saints alive ! now there'll be this letter of Juhan's to tell her of as well. My word, Mary, it will be a business ; \u2014 d'ye think you could come and help me out with it?\" \" No,\" said Mary shortly and decisively ; \" you must go alone. It's your own business, Geoffrey, and you must tell it to her with you own lips. Now, don't keep him another minute, Gertrude ; let him go at once ; only,\" and she gave her brother a parting embrace, \" what a precious old Geoffrey you are, no one in this world will ever know.\""], [188, "180 CHAPTER XVII. A HAPPY MOMENT. Geoffrey felt the task which lay before him was not an easy one. To communicate bad tidings is a hard matter ; but there are cases, and this was one, in which it is almost as hard to know how to communicate good ones. To tell Sir Michael that his son was living, that son whose name for years had never crossed his lips : to announce to Aurelia that the cloud had been lifted, which since her childish days had rested upon her house\u2014 all this poor Geoffrey thought within himself seemed to need a graceful, eloquent, sympathetic tongue ; whereas he had no gift to say more than that \" the thing is so, and I thank God for it.\" So the old feeling of bashful awk- wardness came back upon him very strongly as he presented himself at the Castle, and begged for an interview with Miss Pendragon. He was shown into the room already known to our readers, that very room where, some eight months previously, he had stood on the occasion of Julian's first visit to Merylin, and had watched the"], [189, "A HAPPY MOMENT. 181 courteous bearing of his friend, at the same time catching a glimpse of his own reflection in the mirror. All the shame and misery of that most miserable moment rushed back upon his heart, and to his own consciousness down to his very finger ends he was the same stupid, awkward simpleton that mortified self-love and a sharp touch of jealousy had depicted him on that memorable morning. Meanwhile, Aurelia had not been without her anxieties. In the retired life she led rumours were long in reaching her, and false rumours equally long in receiving their correction. She had heard a confused account of the fray with the smugglers, and of Mr. Houghton's presence on the occasion ; and the messenger who had summoned Father Segrave to the scene of action had left behind a general, but not very distinct impression of bloodshed and danger. So that the announce ment that Geoffrey was waiting below and wished to speak to her conveyed to Aurelia the first cer tain assurance of his safety, and in her joy she entered his presence with a show of warmer cor diality than was her wont. \" I am so glad,\" she exclaimed, holding out both her hands. \" I have been fearing and fancying all kinds of things. There were rumours of killed and wounded.\" \" The rumours were true,\" said Geoffrey ; \" some of the fellows got a scratch or two, but"], [190, "182 URIEL nothing serious, with one exception. Poor Clara s father was badly hurt, and died this morning.\" \" Poor unhappy man,\" said Aurelia ; \" he was a bad fellow, I am afraid. Clara always seemed in terror of him. You must let me see after her now, Mr. Houghton, you must indeed.\" \" You shall see after her as much as you please,\" rephed Geoffrey, \" provided you will listen to what I have to tell you about that man, for it concerns you nearly. You knew him as Bill Fagan, but that was only an alias, of which he had plenty. His real name was Joseph Morton, and he was the son of one of your father's former tenants.\" \" Morton ! \" said Aurelia, putting her hand to her forehead, as if trying to remember. \" Joseph Morton ; I seem surely to have heard that name.\" \" Yes,\" said Geoffrey, \" it was the name of a trooper in your poor brother's regiment. At the time of the trial there was a suspicion on the part of some that he might really have been the guilty party ; for he was not unlike your brother, and in the dark they might have been mistaken for one another.\" \" I remember,\" said Aurelia ; \" and did that suspicion hang over him and injure him ? If so, it is a double reason for being kind now to the poor daughter.\""], [191, "A HAPPY MOMENT. 183 \" No, Aurelia,\" replied Geoffrey, \" that was not my meaning. You must try and bear it, for it will como like a shock, as it were ; but Joe Morton was the real criminal, and your poor brother was innocent.\" \" Innocent ! Uriel innocent ! \" exclaimed Aurelia. For a moment she covered her face with her hands, but the next instant she looked up quickly. \" But if it is only suspicion, that is almost worse, and the poor man dead, too.\" \" It is not suspicion,\" said Geoffrey, \" it is certainty. See here,\" and he drew a paper from his breast. \" Last night, when he knew that he was dying, he confessed all to me, in the presence of witnesses. Here are their signatures, and his own cross to the name I wrote for him. After he had done that, he saw Father Adrian. I believe, poor fellow, that he died penitent.\" Aurelia took the precious paper in her hands, and tried to read, but her tears blinded her. \"How did it come about?\" she said; \"how could you have guessed ? And, oh ! my poor father!\" \" It was about six months back,\" said Geoffrey, \" that I first heard the suspicion started, and it took me that time to track him out. You see, he was a big fellow, and so easier to follow. But, now, that's not all, there's more to hear. You remember the cartoon, Julian's cartoon ? well, you"], [192, "184 URIEL were right ; it was really Uriel. He is hving, and Julian has found him.\" For a minute or two it really seemed as if Geoffrey's fears were justified, and the shock of the great joy more than Aureha could bear. She sat motionless with her head buried in her hands ; then rising suddenly, she exclaimed : \" Oh, how cruel we are to keep him waiting ! Come, Geof frey, come to my father ; come and help me to tell him all ; we must not delay a minute.\" Geoffrey hesitated. \" Father Adrian, per haps \" he said. \" Yes, by-and-by,\" said Aurelia ; \" but not now ; it is your doing, and you yourself must tell him.\" She did not wait for answer or remonstrance, but led the way to her father's apartment. She opened the door gently, and as Geoffrey's eyes fell on the figure of the white-haired old man, with his look of suffering and his attenuated form and features, his heart sank within him lest the great joy he had to communicate might be too much for the feeble brain. Aurelia approached her father, and kneeling beside his chair, she took his hand. \" Geoffrey has come to see you, dear papa,\" she said, \" and he has good news to tell, good and joyful news ; will you listen ? \" A weak hollow voice answered her almost in"], [193, "A HAPPY MOMENT. 185 the words of Tobias : \" Joyful news, Aurelia ? \" it said. \" What manner of joy is there any more for me, who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death ? God's holy will be done. I submit, but do not speak to me of joy.\" Then turning to Geoffrey, whom Aurelia had motioned to take a seat near him \u2014 \" I have heard, Geoffrey Hough ton,\" he continued in the same unearthly tones, as one who spoke seldom and with difficulty, \" I have heard of the fight yonder, and that you did your duty as a brave gentleman. That is as it should be.\" \" I did little enough,\" said Geoffrey, \" but the men who have been so long a terror to this neigh bourhood are taken, and one was killed in the struggle, the son, Sir Michael, of a former tenant of yours, Joseph Morton.\" \" Ay, was it Morton ? \" said Sir Michael, with something more of animation in his tone ; \" they told me some other name.\" . \" Yes,\" replied Geoffrey, \" he had borne a dozen, but he was really Morton, Joe Morton, once a trooper in the \u2014 th dragoons, as you may perhaps remember.\" The old man sat more upright in his chair, and grasping its arms in both his hands fixed his gleaming eyes on Geoffrey ; but he did not speak. \" Morton was in your son'sregiment,\" continued Geoffrey, \" and last night, before he died, he owned"], [194, "186 URIEL the truth. Have courage, Sir Michael, and hear what he bade me tell you : it was he who com mitted the crime with which your son was charged ; Uriel Pendragon was innocent.\" There was a faint cry, and the old man fell back on his pillows, convulsed with an emotion that seemed to stop his breath. Geoffrey sprang to his side, and supported his head on his arm, while Aurelia still held his hand and tried to soothe his agitation by a few gentle words. Gradu ally Sir Michael regained his power of speech, but his mind seemed confused and wandering. \" Was any one speaking of my son ? \" he said, \" was I dreaming, or did I hear his name ? \" \" No, no dream,\" said Geoffrey ; \" he is living and innocent. You have mourned him as dead, but he is living, and living as a brave and noble man.\" Then at last the full heart found relief, and from the white lips of the unhappy father came broken words of thanksgiving and blessing. Geoffrey stood beside him, still supporting him, and from time to time repeating the same tidings, or joining in his words of murmured thanks. A gentle and loving mother could not have been more patient or more tender with a suffering child. Aurelia felt it. \" It has been all Geoffrey's doing, papa,\" she said ; \" we owe everything to Geoffrey.\""], [195, "A HAPPY MOMENT. 187 \" And Julian,\" added Geoffrey, even in that moment mindful of his fidelity to his friend. \" God bless them both,\" said Sir Michael. \" God bless you, Geoffrey Houghton ; in the hour of my anguish you did a son's part to me, and I shall never forget it.\" \" You did indeed,\" said Aurelia, turning hereyes towards Geoffrey, as he stoodthere, with herfather's white head resting trustfully on his arm, looking like the strong, brave, honest friend he truly was. Geoffrey gazed down on the grateful countenance that beamed on him through its tears. It was, perhaps, the very happiest moment of his hfe. Gradually all was told, and Julian's letter read, which conveyed the happy, almost incredible tidings, that the dead was living, and the lost was found. Then Aurelia proposed that Father Adrian should be summoned, and that her father should be left with him awhile. \" I will fetch him,\" said Geoffrey ; \" he knows about Morton's confession, of course ; but not this other matter which Julian had to tell.\" So leaving Sir Michael to his daughter's care, he hastened to seek the chaplain, and making known to him the contents of Julian's letter, begged him at once to go to the old man, on whom the effects of so much agitation could not fail to be serious. Full of joyful wonder, Father Adrian hastened to comply with this request ; and"], [196, "188 URIEL Geoffrey was preparing to leave the Castle, when a quick step behind him made him look back. It was Aurelia, who, leaving her father on the chaplain's entrance, had hastened to find Geoffrey, and bid him farewell. \" You must not go with out a word,\" she said ; \"if 'I only knew how to thank you ! \" \" There is no need,\" said Geoffrey ; \" my thanks will be to see you happy. But there is plenty yet to do.\" \" How so ? \" asked Aurelia. \" Why, we must get this confession of Morton's acknowledged by the proper authorities,\" replied Geoffrey, \" and the sentence reversed ; something formal and regular, you see. Nothing else will satisfy Uriel, or put him straight in the eyes of the world.\" \"I see,\" said Aurelia; \"and how is that to be done?\" \" Oh, I must see about it,\" said Geoffrey. \" I have been thinking of Paxton. He knows every body, and has a world of power, I understand, with all the bigwigs. I think he'd help us in the proper quarters.\" \" Of course he would,\" said Aurelia ; \" how you do think of everything, Geoffrey ! You will write to him at once, will you not ? \" \" Why, no,\" said Geoffrey ; \" I'm no great hand at letters. I must write to Julian to-night, and"], [197, "A HAPPY MOMENT. 189 tell him what has turned up, and get him to make Uriel reasonable, you see. And then, to morrow morning I think I'll just go up to London. There I can see Paxton, and find out what has to be done. It will save time, and a lot of letters, which always bother me. The right words never seem to come.\" \" 0 Geoffrey ! \" said Aurelia, \" how little you know ! And just now, with papa, I kept wonder ing all the time how you seemed to be always finding the right thing to say, and how you could soothe him, and keep his thoughts clear and steady. I could not have done it.\" \" Well, but I wasn't writing, you see,\" said Geoffrey ; \" that is the bother. So I'll be off to morrow ; there is no time to be lost.\" \" Then I have only to say good-bye, and God speed you,\" said Aurelia, as she held out her hand, \" and thanks \u2014 but that I can never say. 0 Geoffrey, how right Mary was in choosing St. Raphael for your angel ! Truly, you have been like him, and brought us joy.\" Geoffrey took the offered hand, and^ tried to speak, but something choked his utterance, and he turned away. Joy, indeed ! his heart was full of it ; yet mingled with it was something that found expression in a sigh."], [198, "190 CHAPTER XVIII. GEOFFREY'S LONDON SEASON. No welcome could possibly have been warmer than that which Geoffrey received from Mr. Paxton, when, presenting himself at that gentle man's elegant little house, in the most aristocratic quarter of the great metropolis, he told his tale and stated the purpose of his coming. Paxton entered heart and soul into the business, and promised that no time should be lost in putting it into the proper hands. \" Make your self quite easy on the subject,\" he said; \"it is a charming end to our Legend of Merylin, and with the proofs with which you are provided there can be no fear as to the issue. But, before I set to work, I must state my conditions.\" \" By all means,\" said Geoffrey ; \" I am in your hands altogether.\" \" Very good,\" said Paxton. \" Then, to begin with, you take up your quarters here. I have not forgotten my delightful three days at Laventor, and seize with avidity this occasion of returning"], [199, "GEOFFREY'S LONDON SEASON. 191 your hospitality. Then, in the next place, as you very judiciously remarked just now, you are in my hands altogether, and if I am to help you, you must leave the management of affairs me. Geoffrey gladly assented to so generous a pro posal, and having been speedily transferred from his hotel to the residence of his illustrious friend, the latter set about in good earnest to secure the legal acknowledgment of Uriel's innocence. \" Now, that is good as far as it goes,\" said Paxton, as they sat together, after the labours of the day were over ; \" but one half of the business remains yet to be done.\" \" And what is that ? \" said Geoffrey ; \"it seems to me things are in a fair way of being settled, and that far quicker than I had hoped.\" \" Well, now,\" said Paxton, \"if we let the matter rest here, what, think you, would come of it ? You'd get your papers and your legal docu ments, reversal of sentence and what not, sure enough ; and there might chance to appear a paragraph in the corner of a paper certifying as much. But the public would never hear of it, and out of twenty men who have known of the disgrace of the Pendragons, not nineteen would learn of the restoration of their good name. No, my dear sir, this is a matter which has to do with the world and its ways, and we must take it after"], [200, "URIEL 192 a worldly fashion. We must advertise you a little. \"Advertise me!\" said Geoffrey; \"why, God bless my soul, what have I to do with the matter ? \u2014 and how will you set about it ? \" \" You will see,\" replied Paxton. \" In the first place, the singular narrative, put in a telling sort of way, in one or two of the most popular papers, including the discovery of the real criminal, and wonderful sagacity and presence of mind displayed throughout the difficult business by Geoffrey Houghton, Esq., of Laventor, a country gentleman of the good old English stamp. Then, a leader or two, with a good shake of pepper and spice ; and, perhaps, an article in the forthcoming number of ' The Present Century,' on ' Our Modern Causes Celebres,' in which the fortunes of the Pendragons shall be handled picturesquely, and the blood of King Arthur made the most of. Stop a bit, I haven't half finished,\" he continued, seeing an insurrectionary movement threatening in Geoffrey's countenance and gestures ; \" we must run you through a drawing-room or two. Let me see, there's Lady Annabel Abbott's recep tion to-morrow evening ; you're a friend of the family, I know ; we'll begin with her.\" \"Thank Heaven,\" cried Geoffrey, \"that is im possible ; I didn't bring a fit out of that sort with' me ; and, I presume, you wouldn't have"], [201, "GEOFFREY'S LONDON SEASON. 193 me attend her ladyship's reception precisely in the costume in which I walk over my fields at Laventor ? \" \" Didn't bring anything with you ? \" said Taston ; \" why, so much the better. I'll take you to Tiglath, Pileser & Co., first-rate artists, or what in the vulgate would be called tailors ; and one magic word from me will secure you their best cut, and a suit fit for an empress's drawing-room, dehvered at your door by half past seven to-morrow evening.\" Geoffrey gasped, and attempted remonstrance ; but he was in the grasp of a more powerful will than his own. Paxton kept his word, and so did Tiglath, Pileser & Co. ; and at a suitable hour the master of Laventor, arrayed as he, at least, had never been arrayed before, found himself ascending the brilliantly-lighted staircase of Holmes-Abbott's London mansion, in which the magnificent state apartments were that evening thrown open to an illustrious assemblage. Under some circumstances to have found him self in such a position would have proved to our hero nothing short of acute mental, one might almost say physical, suffering. The pangs of mauvais honte would have seized him hke a viper, and he would have shuffled himself away in a corner, and awaited in slow anguish the moment x"], [202, "194 URIEL of deliverance. But, guarded and led on by his distinguished friend, the case was different. Wherever Paxton appeared he secured a deferential notice ; whatever Paxton said was listened to ; those whom Paxton delighted to honour were at once credited by the indis criminating world as being somehow or other \" remarkable persons ; \" and so the unknown individual introduced that evening to the Duke of Windermere and the Marchioness of Brighton, and a dozen lesser stars of fashion, by another star of indisputably the first magnitude, was received with respect, consideration, and no small curiosity. The whole thing suited Paxton's whim, and pleased his sense of humour. He had taken good care that the morning papers should that very day have contained a powerful risumi of the \" Remarkable Case \" in process of investiga tion, and a word from him, dropped here and there, was enough to send a whisper through the room that the grave, square-headed man stand ing by Paxton's side was no other than the Mr. Houghton therein spoken of so favourably. Lady Annabel was charmed and delighted at the favourable reception given to \" my old Cornish friend, Mr. Houghton,\" as she called him. \" I am so grateful to you for bringing him,\" she said to Paxton ; \" there is something so piquant about him ; he is having quite a success.\""], [203, "GEOFFREY'S LONDON SEASON. 195 \" Yes,\" replied Paxton ; \" he is doing pretty well, I think. You must help the good cause, Lady Annabel ; no one could do it better.\" \" What is the last cause you have taken up, Mr. Paxton?\" said Lady Annabel; \"is it the Poles, or the Albanians, or the Bulgarians ? And how is it you want me to help ? \" \" Nothing of the sort, my dear madam,\" said Paxton ; \"it is simply this affair of young Pen dragon's. We must set him on his feet again. We've got the main business settled easily enough, and now we must work it into the public mind.\" \" Well, I think you are doing that,\" said Lady Annabel. \" I hear everybody talking of it ; and Mr. Houghton is an advertisement in himself.\" \" Yes,\" said Paxton, \" I think he'll do it. I intend to get him presented before he leaves London, and then, if he makes his appearance in some half-dozen places, judiciously chosen, the in tellect of the metropolis will gradually take in the bearings of the great Pendragon case.\" \" And you want me to aid and abet you in your designs ? \" said Lady Annabel ; \" there will fortu nately be no difficulty in that. Any one who makes his first appearance under Mr. Paxton's introduction \" \" Ah ! \u2014 ah ! \u2014 I understand,\" said that gentle man, \" that is the voice of the syren, which forces a man to close his ears with wax. But you see"], [204, "196 URIEL what I want; just give him a first-rate fort night.\" So a first-rate fortnight Geoffrey had, and if he did not greatly enjoy it his hospitable entertainer did. To a man who, all the year through, was thrown among the rounded pebbles of conventional society, all pretty much the same shape and colour, and differing only in their size, this bit of original rock, struck sharp and fresh from its Cornish quarry, was a delicious study. Geoffrey's appreciation of all he saw and heard, his simplicity and shrewdness, and, above all, the clear ringing note of truth which ran through all he said and did, were to his companion sources of genuine delight. When the fortnight was happily over, Geoffrey found himself provided with all he wanted, and rejoiced with exceeding great joy that his London season had come to an end, and the day of deliverance had dawned. \" Yes,\" said Paxton, \" I believe I must let you go now ; and I think I may say we've done your business pretty fairly. Perhaps I may find my way down to Swinburne again in the course of the winter, and if so, prepare for an invasion. I should like to see the Heir of the Pendragons, and inspect that wonderful cartoon of which you speak. And your sisters, too, and Julian, I should like hugely to see them all again. But what is it I hear about Julian ? is there any truth in the"], [205, "GEOFFREY'S LONDON SEASON. 197 report of his approaching marriage with the young French countess ? \" \" None that I know of,\" said Geoffrey ; \" Lady Annabel quoted you as her authority.\" \"Pshaw, man,\" said Paxton, \"he only dropped a sentimental word or two about ' looking forward to the fulfilment of his fondest hopes ; ' but that, you know, is a cap that might fit any head. I confess / thought his fancy had elsewhere alighted.\" \" I believe you are right,\" said Geoffrey ; \" but men puzzle one, and women, too, for the matter of that. I suppose, however, time will show.\" Meanwhile, he had waited day by day, with no small impatience, for a reply from Julian. It came at last, having been delayed by its trans mission through Laventor. But it contained, together with Julian's expressions of congratula tion and delight, one drop of disappointment. As soon as he had received the letter which an nounced the tidings that the truth was known at last, and that Uriel's fair fame was entirely vindi cated, he had rushed off to St. Florian, to com municate the glad intelligence, and insist on the young man's instant preparation to return with him to his family. \" Alas ! \" wrote Julian, \" I found him stretched on a bed of sickness, nursed by a s\u0153ur grise, and suffering much. There had been a storm, and"], [206, "198 URIEL many wrecks off the coast, and one fearful night the lifeboat was ordered out to rescue the crew of a foundering vessel. They succeeded in doing so, but with great difficulty ; and some of the brave fellows were sadly knocked about. Among the rest, Uriel, who, as usual, distinguished himself by his daring courage, received a blow on the chest from a fallen spar, which they fear has hurt one of the lungs. It would be a serious matter to some men ; but he has the strength of a giant, and in a week or so will battle through it, and be on his feet again. Meantime, I stay here, till he is fit to move, and then we steer straight for Falmouth.\" This was the news which Geoffrey brought to the little home circle, on his return to Laven tor. For a moment Aurelia debated whether she would not hasten to her brother's bedside, but at Geoffrey's earnest entreaty she abandoned the notion. The extreme feebleness of her father, whose shattered strength had been severely tried by the excitement of the last few weeks, seemed to render it impossible for her to leave him. There was nothing for it but to wait in patience, and leave the care of the sick man in Julian's hands ; and, meanwhile, to prepare at Merylin to give a joyful reception to the long-lost heir, and instal him with loving welcome in the home that had been left for years so sad and desolate."], [207, "GEOFFREYS LONDON SEASON. 199 In the meantime, Geoffrey had to stand a severe cross-examination from the home authorities, as to all particulars of his \" London Season.\" Mary wanted to hear what he had eaten at the great dinners ; Gertrude was curious to know if he had danced, and was answered by a decided negative. Mrs. Houghton wondered how the late hours had agreed with him ; one and all were lost in admira tion at his having been presented at Court. Poor Geoffrey felt very much ashamed at all his dis tinctions, especially the last, and returned with renewed vigour to the old habit of putting his hands in his pockets, and talking in his own domestic language. \" Oh, it's all fiddlesticks,\" he said, in reply to some very urgent questions re garding his appearance at St. James's. \" Don't see the meaning of it myself, I don't. There's just a half-moon, as you may call it, and your name's called out, and before you know where you are you are out again, and the thing is over. And the rig-out for that piece of folly would have put a new roof upon the mill ; 'pon my life, I believe it would ! \" \" It's my belief,\" said Gertrude, \" that when Geoffrey dies the mill will be found written on his heart. Rodolph once said that he believed Geoffrey's affections were equally divided between the mill and the Pendragons.\" To this sally Geoffrey only answered by a"], [208, "200 URIEL. growl, but it was one expressive of supreme content, and seemed to say that he, the growler, was at home once more, and that for Rodolph and all the world beside he cared not a single farthing*."], [209, "201 CHAPTER XIX. THE RESTORATION. The weeks sped by, and at length, towards the end of September, the welcome letter arrived announcing that Uriel was now sufficiently re covered to travel, and that in a couple of days from the receipt of that despatch, he and his little son, under Julian's escort, might be expected at Falmouth. Geoffrey resolved on hastening thither to meet them on landing, that the poor exile might receive one hearty greeting as he set foot again on his native shore. Moreover, it was Sir Michael's wish that Uriel, on his first return home, should be accompanied by the two devoted friends to whose exertions he owed his restoration to his family and his good name. An interest deeper than curiosity, though, doubtless, not unmingled with it, stirred the neighbourhood when they learned the day that the young heir was expected. At his own earnest desire, supported by the plea of his state of health, no public reception was provided ; but this did"], [210, "202 URIEL. not prevent a numerous assemblage of tenants and neighbours from welcoming him at the Tremadoc station with vociferous cheers ; and as the carriage which bore him to the Castle drove swiftly by, the road was lined with bystanders, who renewed the same acclamations. Mary and Gertrude took part in the general excitement. A convenient spot in their own demesne was found to command a glimpse of the public road ; where, safely establishing themselves, they had the satisfaction of witnessing the passing of the carriage. What was it they beheld ? Three black figures, one of whom bowed as he passed to the wayside groups ; and, appearing for a moment at the carriage-window, a little face, all smiles and golden hair, a vision of childish beauty and innocence, \" as it were the face of an angel.\" This was the report which they brought back to their mother ; and then there was nothing for it but to wait in patience till Geoffrey should come back from the Castle, and tell them all about it. He came at last. \" Well, it is over,\" he said ; \" wonderful how the old man bore it all. One would have said for the last year or so he has been but half ahve ; but somehow, there's no denying it, there's always a kind of go in the old blood, which nothing will extinguish.\""], [211, "THE RESTORATION. 203 \" Did you see their meeting ? \" said Mary. \" 0 Geoffrey, I don't think I could have borne it.\" \" No,\" said Geoffrey ; \" Aurelia took her brother straight to Sir Michael's room, and they were alone together for a good bit. We waited in the drawing-room, Julian, and Father Segrave, and Marmaduke \u2014 yes, he's there \u2014 and one or two others ; and presently Sir Michael came in, with Uriel on one side, and Aurelia on the other, holding the little boy by the hand. You would have thought the old man had had twenty years given back to him ; he looked like a grand old prophet, with his flowing white hair, as he pre sented his son to his friends, and they all wel comed him : and Uriel himself \u2014 well, I don't know what to think of him.\" \" Don't you like him, Geoffrey ? \" asked Ger trude ; \" I hoped he would have been nice.\" \" Oh, I like him well enough ; it's not that ; but I don't know if he is exactly what you women call nice ; he's, well \" and Geoffrey's descrip tive powers seemed to fail him. \" Unpolished, perhaps,\" said Mrs. Houghton ; \" you know, my dear, he has had a rough life of it.\" \" No, not that either,\" said Geoffrey ; \" he is like a man who does not belong to this world, who does not care for it, and has nothing more to do with it ; dead and buried and come to life again ; that sort of thing, you see.\""], [212, "URIEL 204 \" A curious description,\" said Gertrude ; \" but we must judge for ourselves by-and-by. And the child ? \" \" Ah, little Uriel, as they call him ; a real picture, he is, with his glittering hair and his French toggery. Imogen, it seems, had taken upon her to get up his wardrobe, and had tricked him out like a fairy.\" \" And Imogen,\" said Gertrude, \" have you heard, can you make out, if there was anything in that report ? \" \" No, nothing,\" said Geoffrey, with a strange expression for a moment passing over his features. \" I asked Julian point-blank, and he looked gravely at me, and only said : ' I don't change with the wind, Geoffrey ; I thought you would have known me better.' \" \" He stays at the Castle, as a matter of course,\" said Gertrude. \" I suppose the next thing we hear will be that the cartoons are finished.\" \" Ah, I forgot,\" said Geoffrey ; \" the cartoons are finished, and the chapel will be opened on the 29th. It is one of Julian's secrets; he is a strange fellow. When he found that he should be detained at St. Florian, he gave orders to Gules to get them finished by some first-rate artist, provided only it was one who would exe cute his designs. So it is done, and no one knew it ; and the chapel will be opened on the"], [213, "THE RESTORATION. 205 29th, that is, next Wednesday, you know, as a solemn thanksgiving for Uriel's return.\" It was decided by the family conclave that they would wait till Wednesday's solemnity was over before presenting themselves at the Castle to offer their congratulations. Every one felt, by a common instinct, that those who had been so sadly separated and so wonderfully re united needed to be left alone for awhile, and that on the first days of restored happiness none even of their best friends could intrude. Nor in the interval did they see anything of Julian, whose entire time from daybreak to sunset was spent in the chapel, preparing for the opening ceremony. His plans for the restoration had been skilfully and faithfully executed by Gules, but he felt a pardonable pleasure in the thought that their conception had been his own. Equally his own were the arrangements for the coming festival ; it had all been planned and thought of as he had sat by Uriel's sick-bed at St. Florian, and the re sult of his cogitations had been communicated to Father Segrave, with directions how they might be carried out with the least possible amount of premonitory bustle. On St. Michael's Day, then, the little chapel was filled with an expectant crowd ; and the eyes of some among them, used in old time to the"], [214, "206 URIEL mouldy walls and crumbling stone-work it had displayed in its ruinous condition, wondered to behold it all, not changed or replaced by carvings and adornments of a new design, but touched and restored, as it were, by some magic finger, which had only perfected and brought back the beauty which by time had decayed. Angels looked down from the carved bosses, and the flash of their gleaming wings might be caught on the walls of the sanctuary ; while on the spot where the old defaced paintings had crumbled away appeared the Seven Spirits, executed by a master's hand from the cartoons which had filled so important a place in the family story. They were there ; and there, conspicuous among them, was St. Uriel, with his golden hair and flashing sword, \"The Light and the Strength of God.\" None who had seen the heir of Merylin could fail to recognise his likeness ; only a few knew how that hkeness had been obtained, and that, in very truth, it was that painting which had fur nished the first clue to the discovery that he was still alive. But what hand was that which drew from the organ those sweet and solemn tones ? And what voices were those which rose to the vaulted roof, and swelled in heavenly harmony, as though the angels themselves were joining in the chant ? The hand was Julian's, as skilled in music as in"], [215, "THE RESTORATION. 207 other arts ; and the voices were from a white robed company he had brought together, who now filled the stalls of the old choir, and made its roof and walls give back the echo of the joyous words : \" Tibi, Christe, Splendor Patris Vita, virtus cordium, In conspectu Angelorum Votis, voce psallimus, Alternantes concrepando Melos damus vocibus.\" But it was one kneeling group that attracted all eyes and moved all hearts. The father, with his son and daughter by his side; the tall gigantic figure of the son, with his golden hair, marking him for a true Pendragon of Merylin ; and kneeling by his side, in sweet unconscious beauty, the httle Uriel, looking like the flash of a sunbeam.

' \""], [216, "208 CHAPTER XX. SOME MISTAKES AND EXPLANATIONS. It was all over ; the thanksgiving ceremony and the subsequent visits and congratulations. Merylin was alive again ; and as though to impress on all the fact that the dark cloud and all its associations were gone for ever, Sir Michael had driven through Tremadoc, with his son by his side ; the first time for twelve melancholy years that he had crossed his own park boundary. \" And now, I suppose,\" said Gertrude, one morning, \" we shall return to ordinary life again ? One has lived such a story-book existence of late, that the first thought on getting up in the morn ing is ' What next ? ' \" \" Oh, the next thing,\" said Rodolph, who happened to be one of the party, \" the next thing, of course, will be a batch of weddings. Whatever course the story takes, at St. George's, Hanover Square, it is bound to end.

The Fair Imogen will then give her hand to her deliverer (for I hear Julian threatens to shoot any one who couples his name with hers) ; and then the devoted friend will turn into the devoted brother. I see it all, written with golden capitals in the Book of Fate.\" Geoffrey had no taste for this style of discussion ; Rodolph's rattle wearied and secretly disgusted him ; he rose, yawned a little, then leaving the room retired to his own study, where presently after Mary joined him, and coming behind his chair, found him, as it seemed, intently studying a map of North America. \" What are you looking at ? \" she asked, with some surprise ; \" what in the world has made you take to geography ? \" \" Manitoba,\" answered Geoffrey shortly ; \" it's the new place where every one goes. I'm thinking of looking it up myself some day.\" \" You ! \" said Mary, who thought him only joking, \" then, you know, you will have to take me with you.\" \" Ay,\" said Geoffrey, \" that would be jolly. o"], [218, "210 URIEL.

Could you really ever tear yourself from dear old Laventor and the mill ? \" \" I don't know,\" replied Geoffrey ; \" here's Gertrude to be married in the spring, I suppose ; and you'll be getting spliced some day, Mary : if ever I were to be left alone at Laventor, I don't think, somehow, I could stand it. Besides, I should really like to have a look at their new country farming ; I heard a lot about it when I was in London. There's a famous opening at a place, only I can't find the name on the map.\" \" I don't think I shall ever get spliced, as you call it,\" said Mary ; \" and if you go to Manitoba, I shall go too, that is certain ; so I had better prepare for it, and shall begin by feeding the chickens.\" She left him as she spoke, and for some time Geoffrey continued alone, pursuing his geogra phical researches. Presently the door opened, and some one put in a head. \" All right,\" said Geoffrey, without turning round to see who it was, and supposing it was Mary returning from the chickens ; \" it's Arkan sacow, that's the place ; awful crops, they say ; only you must look sharp after the bears ; they'd make short work with your pet lambs, I fancy.\""], [219, "SOME -MISTAKES AND EXPLANATIONS. 211 A light laugh made him look up. \" Why, God bless my soul, is it you, Julian ? \" he exclaimed ; \" I thought it was Mary.\" \" Not exactly,\" replied Julian. \" But can you spare me a minute or two ? \u2014 you look deep in something.\" \" No, nothing pressing,\" said Geoffrey ; \" and you've not been here since all these great events. Well, on my word, Julian, between us I think we have done it.\" \" Yes,\" said Julian ; \"I have done what I promised to do in this very room, some nine months or so ago, and now I have come to ask for my reward.\" \" With all my heart,\" said Geoffrey earnestly ; \" I fancy, Julian, I can guess what it is, and I can only say, may God make you both happy ! \" \" Thank you,\" said Julian ; \" I was only wait ing for that. I could not venture to try my fate -without being sure you gave it your sanction.\" \" My sanction ! \" said Geoffrey, with a touch of bitterness in his tone ; \" you know well enough, Julian, that I have no sanction to give in such a matter.\" \" Well, not formally, perhaps ; still I couldn't be happy to speak to her till I had said a word to you. I know what she is to you, and I feel like a villain for asking to take her from you.

You know she has stood my friend all along. That day at Merylin, when we all said ' Good-bye,' she promised she would look after my interests.\" \" Well, if Aurelia consents, I suppose that is sufficient,\" said Geoffrey coldly. \" I thought I understood that you had not yet spoken to her ? \" \"Not to Mary,\" said Julian ;\" of course not, I could not till I had spoken to you. But to Aurelia, why, bless you, she has known all about it from the beginning.\" Geoffrey looked at his friend as one fairly puzzled. \" Look here,\" he said, \" you know what a blockhead I am in taking a thing in. What is it you came to tell me ? \" \" My dear Geoffrey, surely I have told you,\" said Julian ; \" surely you understand that I want you to give me the hand of your sister Mary ? \" Geoffrey remained as one dumbfounded, he could not even give utterance to his surprise. \" Why, I thought you would have guessed it long ago,\" said Julian ; \" that was why I cut up a little rough with you when you began chaffing me about Imogen ; I thought you knew, or ought to have known, that I was not one to change in a month or so.\" \" My stars ! \" ejaculated Geoffrey at last, \" why, I thought, Julian, \u2014 I know you will think me an"], [221, "SOME MISTAKES AND EXPLANATIONS. 213 ass \u2014 but I felt sure all this time that you had been thinking of Aurelia.\" The light merry laugh broke once more from Julian's lips. \" Aurelia ! \" he exclaimed. \" Was that what you were thinking of? Oh, set your heart at rest on that score for ever. We are tremendous friends, and she has been in my confidence since last Christmas ; but for anything else, a British princess is far above out of my ken. I don't aim at metal of such superlative quality, not I. 1 The homely round, the common task, \"Will furnish all I need or ask. ' And provided Maiy will put up with my erratic ways, I shall be the happiest man alive.\" Geoffrey could only wring his friend's hand till it ached, and tell him that he would find Mary \" somewhere with the chickens \" \u2014 a hint which Juhan at once prepared to make use of by departing in the direction of those interesting bipeds. \" I have been a precious simpleton, it seems,\" thought Geoffrey to himself. He did not know whether to be glad or sorry. Sorry to lose Mary, and glad if he must lose her, to give her to Julian. Glad, just for a passing moment glad, to think of Aurelia as really free ; yet sorry, too, for he could better have borne to have seen her Julian's than to hear of her marriage with a stranger. But it"], [222, "214 URIEL would be so in the natural course of things. Merylin was now restored to its natural position in the county ; the world would be fast flowing into it and around it ; great families would be seeking its alliance ; and the old days, sad, lonely, vet full of sweetness in remembrance, when he was the only friend of the father and the daughter \u2014 those \" dear old days \" were gone for ever. It was more than he could bear to think of, and seizing his hat he was just setting off for his usual resource, the mill \u2014 when a note was brought in Aurelia's handwriting, begging him to call at the Castle, as her father wanted to see him on business. He would gladly just then have escaped pre senting himself at Merylin, for he was conscious of a certain interior agitation, which threw him somewhat off his balance. However, he could not disregard the summons ; so to the Castle he went ; and being ushered into Sir Michael's presence found the old man engaged with his son in looking over deeds and papers connected with his estate. \" We wanted your help, Geoffrey,\" said the old baronet. \" You must understand, Uriel, that for the last twelve years Mr. Houghton has stood to me in the place of a son. Never must you or yours forget what we owe him.\" \" I am not likely to forget what I owe him,\" said Uriel, grasping Geoffrey's hand in his with warm affection. \" My sister has told me all, Mr."], [223, "SOME MISTAKES AND EXPLANATIONS. 21; Houghton ; she has told me all you have been to her and to my father.\" They sat down together, and went through various papers and accounts. It was Geoffrey's element, and he felt the hour of business had braced him, and made him himself again. But when the business was ended, and leaving the study he was making his way towards the hall-door, he encoun tered on his way the very person whom, at that moment, he would most willingly have avoided. It was Aurelia, looking joyous and radiant, with little Uriel clinging to her side. At their first meeting she had won his heart, and the two were now rarely separated. \" 0 Mr. Houghton, how glad I am ! \" she exclaimed; \" I was so longing to see you, and to say how happy I am about dear Mary.\" Just then Uriel heard his father's voice, and with a cry of pleasure ran off to find him. \" Is he not charming ? \" said Aurelia. \" To see his little cherub face, and hear his laugh is like sunshine in the house ; it does not seem like the old place ; too bright, far too bright, for Merylin. But now, Mr. Houghton, if it is not indiscreet, do tell me if it is all right with Mary.\" She led the way as she spoke into the sitting room she had just quitted, and whether he would or no, Geoffrey had to follow her. \" I suppose it is all right,\" he said ; \" Julian"], [224, "216 URIEL is now at Laventor, and left me to go to Mary ; \u2014 how it has ended I cannot say. I was amazed ! \" \" But you had no right to be amazed, surely,\" said Aurelia ; \" you knew about it, I thought, when all that foolish gossip was going on about Imogen. Don't you remember assuring me that, though appearances were against him, you were certain Julian would prove faithful ? \" \" I believe I have been very thick-headed in the whole matter,\" said Geoffrey. \" You see, I fancied \u2014 that is, I thought \u2014 that Julian had something quite different in his mind.\" She looked at him in surprise ; and then, by a sudden sort of flash, seemed to comprehend his meaning. \" 0 Geoffrey ! how could you ? \" she exclaimed, then paused : and a very awkward pause they both felt it. \" I tell you I have been a simpleton,\" said Geoffrey ; \"I generally am, I believe. But this time my blunder has had some good results. It was really thinking that, which first set me to work on Uriel's business.

He had never meant to say what he had said ; and how Aurelia might under stand it he could not tell. She would probably only have thought him blundering and stupid, and, in short, hke himself. Still, odd to say, his heart felt lighter for having given itself that relief; and when late in the autumn evening Mary found him sitting alone, he received her with a bright gaiety not usual in his manner. \" Well, Mary, old girl,\" he said, gently draw ing her to him, \" have you got anything to tell me, since I saw you last ? \" \" Yes, one thing,\" said Mary. \" And what is that ? \" \" That I have been thinking it over, and you must not go to Manitoba ; for you see, Geoffrey, 1 could not now go with you.\" \" Ah,\" rephed Geoffrey, \" I perceive ; it strikes me that conclusion was come to in the chicken yard this morning. But who knows ? Perhaps Julian will go with us ! \u2014 we will talk it over with him this evening.\""], [226, "218 CHAPTER XXI. CHANGES. We must crave our readers' permission to pass somewhat rapidly over several months which followed the events recorded in our last chapter. Uriel Pendragon's return home and the complete re-establishment of the family honour were now accomplished facts ; nor did there remain on the towers of Merylin the least shadow of the old cloud. Nothing, in fact, could have been more thorough and satisfactory than the public recogni tion of his innocence. An offer was made from the military authorities to restore him his commission, and no opportunity was lost by the leading per sonages in his own county of inviting him to assume among them the position formerly occupied by the head of his family. But while Uriel showed himself sensible of every kindness, and grateful for every mark of consideration for his father's sake, he gently but firmly declined accepting any proposal which could bring him before the eyes of the world. On this point Aurelia was a little disposed to take him to task."], [227, "CHANGES. 219 '\u2022 If it is sensitiveness, Uriel,\" she one day said, \" because you shrink from notice after what has passed, believe me, that would only be another form of pride.\" \" No, Aurelia,\" he replied ; \" but there are things with which a dead man has nothing to do. And I am as good as dead, you see. Even if I had a long life before me, I doubt if I could ever revive to the ways and fashions of the world ; but, dear Aurelia, do not deceive yourself, I have not a long hfe before me, but a very little span. I feel it shortening day by day, and what there is of it I would not willingly spend upon an empty show.\" She looked distressed. \" Why, what is there to be sad about ? \" he continued. \" If you knew what life has been to me these twelve years past, you would rejoice with me that I am likely to get my discharge. You will say that is all over now, and that a bright future is before me. But you don't know \u2014 you could not, I suppose, be expected to realise \u2014 how what I have gone through has cut me off from everything. I could not take root again, Aurelia ; it is past and over. I have prayed daily for these many years past, that one thing at least I might do with this poor shattered life of mine, and I think the desire of my heart has been granted.\""], [228, "URIEL 220 \" What is it, dear Uriel ? You must not give me a half-confidence, you must tell me all.\" He smiled his sweet sad smile, and took her hand. \"At St. Florian,\" he said, \"I used to pray that I might one day give my life to save that of another ; and I think it will be so. I have taken my last cruise, I fear, for I doubt if I have strength now to pull an oar. But that blow they told you of has done its work here,\" and he laid his hand on his breast, \" and I know, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that my days are numbered. Well, it is all right ; we saved the drowning crew that night, and so, you see, my heart's desire will be granted.\" Aurelia's tears were flowing fast. \" But, Uriel,\" she said, \" think of what depends upon you ; think of my father and all his hopes ; surely it is not wrong to pray that your life may be spared, that you may comfort him, and build up our unfortunate family.\" \" I do hope I may hve to close his eyes,\" said Uriel, \" but as for rebuilding our family, it is not I who shall do that. Don't think me superstitious, Aurelia, but you remember the old prophecy. It is not the ' fallen heir ' who is to restore the fortunes of his house, but another ; \" ' Angel by name, of angel face, The peasant-born shall fill his place? \""], [229, "CHANGES. 221 And as he spoke he pointed through the open window where they sat, to the terrace, where play ing and singing in childish glee, might be seen tho httle Uriel. \" ' Of angel face,' indeed,\" said Aurelia ; \" but your name also is Uriel, and if Julian's cartoon is worth anything \" \" Ay,\" interrupted Uriel, \" but the last line is not fulfilled in me, though it is in him. His mother, Aurelia, was a simple peasant girl, my poor Jacqueline. Perhaps you wonder at my having made such a marriage ; but was I not become a peasant myself \u2014 and baser, lower than a peasant ; in the world's eyes, a felon ? She was so good and pious, and as innocent as a daisy. They tell me that the child inherits my features, but I love to think that it is from his mother he has his gay temper and his loving httle heart. Believe me, there is the true heir of Merylin, ' the peasant born,' the real Uriel who will restore the fortunes of our house.\" Aureha accused him of superstition in attaching any weight to the old prophecy, though it was only with half a heart that she tried to rally him. \" As you will,\" he said, \" but if Alice Spier the-Span had never croaked her doggrel rhymes, it would make but httle odds to me. I don't say it will be to-day or to-morrow, but I have that in me which before very long will set me free.\""], [230, "URIEL 222 But though he spoke thus openly to Aurelia, he did his best, and successfully, to conceal from his father that there was anything amiss. He saw plainly enough that the shock of sudden joy, coming on the frame shattered by long years of suffering and austerity, had told on his father's feeble health, and that the appearances of renewed life and vigour were altogether deceptive. He hoped that just so much life might be given him as would help him to soothe the old man's last hours, and to suffer him to close his eyes in peace ; and so, indeed, it came to pass. Sir Michael's decline, after the first joy was over, became rapid and unmistakeable ; and three months after Uriel's reinstatement in his home, his father breathed his last, blessing God with his dying accents that the sins of his house had been expiated, and the wrath of Heaven turned away. This event, which took place just after Christmas, was scarcely felt to be a sad one ; rather it came on all hearts with a sense of joy. It was as if a long day of storms and darkness had cleared at the evening hour, and been illuminated by a golden ray. That the son should be given back just in time to console his father's dying hours, and succeed to his rightful inheritance, could not be felt as other than a marvellous mercy. So all the world congratulated the new Sir"], [231, "CHANGES. 223 Uriel, and predicted great things of his future career. Condolences and congratulations ! deaths and marriages ! such is the chequered web of human life. The month of January had seen the re stored chapel hung in black for the funeral dirge of its former lord, and the month of April beheld it decked with garlands for the celebration of the double wedding of the two sisters of Laventor. Rodolph and Gertrude departed on the cus tomary \" wedding tour,\" after which they were to settle in London, where Rodolph was to be launched on a professional career ; and Julian was bent on taking Mary to Italy, leaving the question of their future place of residence as yet undecided. Though he had in the future what the world calls \" brilhant expectations,\" his present means were modest enough, and he assured his bride that she would have nothing to look forward to for many a year but a cottage and a spinning wheel ; a prospect which Mary declared was exactly to her taste. So Geoffrey and his mother were left alone together. His kind, unselfish heart multiplied ways and contrivances for supplying to her the loss of her daughters ; but though his efforts were crowned with tolerable success as regarded her, he never by word or complaint gave token of the dreary blank which he himself was feeling."], [232, "URIEL 224 Mary indeed had been to him his second self; he knew she would remain ever true and loving ; but he knew also that she would no longer be his as she had been from their childish days. Another sacrifice for his poor heart to offer, and he did his best to make it. But that was not all. It was as though the forest of his old life were being cleared, and one by one the familiar trees were falling around him. There was change everywhere, change at Laventor, change at the Castle. Sir Uriel, indeed, gave him the same trust and confidence that his father had done, but the case was wholly different. To the old man Geoffrey had acted as guide and pro tector, but Uriel could judge and see and govern things for himself. He consulted Geoffrey, and loved to do so ; but as Geoffrey thought within himself, he could have done as well without him. And as to Aureha there could not but be a difference now in their respective positions. During the years of her father's melancholy re tirement Geoffrey had stood to her in the place of brother, and had faithfully discharged a brother's part. That, of course, was over now, and with Uriel at her side nothing more was wanted. Her life seemed to centre itself in him and in the child, who had called out a new sympathy in her heart, and awakened all its tenderness. Perhaps, too, since the conversation recorded in our last I"], [233, "CHANGES. 225 chapter, a certain, almost imperceptible, change had come over their mutual relations. Geoffrey was always received with respect, affection, and cordiality ; but it did not prevent his feel ing the inevitable fact that a new order of things had taken the place of the old, and that the past was past for ever. All lives have some hard, tough bits in them : periods when the sky is not so much tempestuous as dull, grey, and leaden : when courage is needed, not to subdue kingdoms, or to stop the mouths of lions, but to bear the weight of each day as it comes, and plod on through the weary hours as best we may. It is these cheerless moments in life which put souls on their trial, and test the strength that is in them \u2014 a strength required, not for the heat of the battle, but for the long day's march. Geoffrey did not make many reflections on the matter, for his was a character that rarely formulated principles, but was ever acting on them. The time was a trying one to spirits and to temper, but he laid a strong, firm hold on the guiding clue of duty, and it helped him through. On he went, giving himself to his work, resolved to be indifferent to the aching of his empty heart, and pushing away from him the spectres of regret, self-pity, moroseness, and bitterness, which clam- p"], [234, "226 URIEL oured about his daily path with such importunate persistence. Then came a new source of trouble and anxiety. Uriel's health was beginning visibly to fail, and after various consultations and much urgent soli citation on Aurelia's part, it was at last decided that they should go to London for the best ad vice, and probably set out thence to try the chance of a warmer climate. Geoffrey assisted at the deliberations, and agreed in the wisdom of the plan. He helped in every arrangement, and took on himself the management of affairs during their absence. He did his best to cheer Aurelia's hopes ; in short, he was, what he had always been, the strong, helpful friend. But when he had seen them fairly off, and beheld the carriage that bore them away disappear through the old gateway, then at last there came upon him the full sense of his great loneliness, and for the first time perhaps he began to realise how much of his heart he had suffered to escape his own mastery. So the sad autumn days set in and found Geoffrey devoting himself to the old routine of work and business, but, it must be fairly owned, with the rehsh gone which once made his labours a pleasure. Not for that, however, did he relax in their fulfilment, or show himself a whit less painstaking. And by this time he had earned a"], [235, "CHANGES. 227 character in the county as a man of hard work, great sagacity, and spotless integrity, so that he was appealed to in many affairs, and had little leisure for moody reflections. Autumn was fast becoming winter, and the short days brought the Holmes- Abbotts back to Swinburne, with the usual complement of visitors in their train. There, as elsewhere, some changes were apparent in the family circle. Mabel had made a marriage that satisfied her mother's ex pectations, and, it is to be presumed, her own, as her husband was a tolerably rich baronet ; so that Geoffrey had nothing now to fear from her powers of ridicule, even if Julian's marriage with his sister, and his own greatly improved position in the judgment of the world, had not availed to convert ridicule into respect. So, when Christmas came, it was quite natural that Geoffrey should once more receive a note from Lady Annabel pressing him to visit them, and naming, as an additional motive for his acceptance, the presence at Swinburne of \" your old friend, Mr. Paxton.\" And somehow, Geoffrey was glad to accept. The flunkies and the French dishes, the company of strangers, and the talk about big people, were not more to his taste than heretofore, but his own diffidence and awkwardness were less, and the prospect of seeing Paxton again was a real pleasure. So to Swinburne he went."], [236, "228 URIEL Everybody received him heartily and kindly. Some of the guests were of the neighbourhood, and cognisant of his real claims on their respect and consideration. Others knew him only as brother-in-law to Mr. Julian Wyvern. A few had met him in Lady Annabel's salon during his memorable London fortnight, and had a confused remembrance of Mr. Houghton's being pointed out to them that evening as a \" remarkable man.\" As to Paxton, he greeted him not as an acquaint ance, but a friend. It was decidedly a much more agreeable state of things than that which he had encountered at the same dinner-table a brief two years before. He was thinking so, as he found himself getting through the evening with a certain amount of social facihty, when the commonplace remark from some lady guest, that \" she hoped Lady Annabel had good accounts from her daughter,\" gave an unexpected turn to the con versation. There were excellent accounts from Mabel ; Lady Annabel had had a letter from her only that morning. So full of spirits : she and Sir Henry were at Naples, and enjoying it so much. \" Somehow, everybody seems to be at Naples this winter,\" she continued: \" the Winder mere party are there, and Julian, and your friends, Mr. Houghton, the Pendragons ; \u2014 so sorry to hear about Sir Uriel's health ; \u2014 but he has had so many trials.\""], [237, "CHANGES. 229 Paxton caught the name, and it at once attracted his attention. \" Ah, Sir Uriel Pendra gon ! \" he said, \" I ought to know that name again ; I hoped that his trials had all come to an end, and that ' the Fortune of the dragon race,' Mr. Lindesay was once good enough to tell us about, was now fairly reinstated.\" \" Oh, in one way, of course it is,\" replied Lady Annabel ; \" but he is dreadfully delicate, and they have gone to Naples for his health. Mabel tells me that Miss Pendragon is making quite a sensation there ; \u2014 nothing like it known for years ; \u2014 it seems certain, I believe, that her marriage with the duke will take place on their return to England.\" \" What duke ? \" asked Geoffrey of Eugenia, who sat next him, in a tone in which something of his old growl was audible. \" The Duke of Windermere,\" she replied ; \" Mabel has spoken of it in .several of her letters. You saw him, I think, at our house one evening. He is a convert, you know, and every one has been speculating who would be the fortunate lady, for it seems he was resolved only to choose a Catholic.\" \" A great match for the Pendragons,\" said Ladjr Annabel ; \" but I'm really glad ; for if poor Sir Uriel dies, as they say he will, Aurelia, poor girl, would be left alone.\""], [238, "URIEL 230 \" Well,\" said Mr. Lindesay, \" and I don't see but it's quite suitable. If you come to pedigree, the Pendragons have the advantage. Winder mere is not a very old creation, I fancy.\" \" Oh yes,\" said Eugenia, \" but you know pedigree counts for very little now in this liberalised world of ours. Still, no doubt, it's quite suitable, and Aurelia will look the duchess to perfection.\" \" And act it too,\" said Mr. Lindesay ; \" shouldn't you say so, Mr. Houghton ? It always struck me in her poor father's time that she showed great power of management.\" Geoffrey had been holding a wineglass in his hand, apparently occupied in turning its beauti fully cut stem, with a view of observing the prismatic colours. But at this appeal he was obliged to look up, though he did not distinguish himself by the quota he contributed to the con versation. He only said, \" Quite so.\" Paxton's eye was scanning him curiously. We have said that with the great poet study of character was something more than an amuse ment. It came near to an occupation ; and the wonderful pictures struck off in those felicitous phrases which filled his writings were after all but reflections of images, less conceived by his fancy than caught from nature by his keen eye, and laid up for future use. Observation of others was"], [239, "CHANGES. 231 become such a habit with him that he carried it on almost unconsciously ; and he had brought the art to such perfection that he read the human countenance as other men would read a book. And in Geoffrey Houghton's countenance, and in his whole bearing, he had detected a great change. Freer, more self-possessed, not one whit less honest and original, yet decidedly softer and more refined. The results were patent to all beholders, but Paxton's curiosity was piqued to know the cause. His campaign in the great Pendragon case, and his London fortnight, might have done something, but it certainly could not have done all. \" No,\" said the shrewd observer to himself, \" it is only suffering that can have wrought that change ; Geoffrey Houghton has suffered, and what is more, he is suffering still.\" When once he had reached that conclusion his interest was roused to pursue the game. The inquiry would have had its attractions for him even if the subject of it had been a total stranger ; how doubly so when it affected the happiness of his Cornish diamond, as he was wont to call the squire of Laventor. The rest of the evening, therefore, he devoted to watching the unconscious Geoffrey, in an unobtrusive fashion of his own ; and in each line of his countenance, in each tone of his voice, in the subjects on which he seemed willing to speak, as"], [240, "232 URIEL in those which he showed himself resolute in avoiding, Paxton alike gathered materials which he was not slow in skilfully piecing together. \" Are you anything of a sportsman, Mr. Paxton ? \" said Holmes- Abbott, addressing his guest ; \" some of our friends here are preparing for great execution to-morrow among the pheasants.\" \" Thanks,\" said Paxton, \" but I leave executions to Marwood and his assistants ; and I should run a good chance of being delivered to their tender mercies if I were to take a gun in my hand, for I should certainly shoot something besides the pheasants.\" \" Sorry for that,\" said his good-natured host ; \" I was in hopes you would enjoy a good day's sport. I believe there are not better preserved woods in all the country.\" \" Then for fear of being peppered in them by mistake,\" replied Paxton, \" I shall avoid them carefully, in the long walk to which I have set my heart on challenging Mr. Houghton, unless indeed he prefers the battue.\" \" With all my heart,\" said Geoffrey, with a start, rousing himself from something very like a brown study, into which he had fallen whilst the talk around him had turned on dogs, guns, and game-bags. \" But surely you are a sportsman ? \" said Mr."], [241, "CHANGES. 233 Lindesay ; \" without the cry of ' Death to the pheasants ! ' a country gentleman would be sadly put to it for winter occupation.\" \"As he is likely to be, if things go on as they have begun,\" said young Holmes-Abbot, reckoned the best shot in the county, and much distin guished at pigeon-matches. \" I don't know,\" said Geoffrey, with his usual absence of human respect. \" I shoot a pheasant or two when I want to eat them. It gives one an object for a beat through the woods on an October morning. But for the ' kill, kill, kill ! ' just to fill one's game-bag with so many dead birds \u2014 for my own part, I would as soon be a poulterer, and wring their necks in my poultry yard.\" Several of the gentlemen exchanged glances, and young Holmes- Abbott shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say \" You know he is an original.\" \" Is it a question of conscience ? \" said Mr. Lindesay, who was rather fond of displaying what he called \" a respect for opinions.\" \" The huntsman's pursuit of wild game has, I fancy, never been forbidden. It finds honourable men tion even in the pages of Scripture.\" \" Ay, the huntsman,\" said Geoffrey ; \"just so; wild animals and so forth. I shall shoot bears, I daresay, when I get to Manitoba. But, then, there is a difference. If I don't shoot them they"], [242, "URIEL 234 may chance to eat me, or, what is nearly as bad, to eat my sheep.\" \" And are you going to Manitoba ? \" asked Eugenia, with surprise ; \" that is quite an unex pected piece of news.\" \" Some day possibly I may,\" replied Geoffrey ; \" people talk of the benefit of foreign travel, and the backwoods would be more to my taste than the Bay of Naples.\" \" So he is thinking of Manitoba, is he ? \" thought Paxton. \" I shall hear more on that subject before I have done with him to-morrow.\""], [243, "235 CHAPTER XXII. A WALK WITH PAXTON. The morning had come, bright and cheery, and the sportsmen had all set forth to the woods, a lively party of men and dogs, whilst Geoffrey, indifferent to the surprise excited by his whim sicality in declining a day's shooting in the best pheasant covert of Cornwall, was conducting Paxton over the broad open downs that stretched along the coast in the direction of Tremadoc. \" You are a bold man, Mr. Houghton,\" said Paxton ; \" those remarks of yours last night about the gentlemen poulterers were rather home thrusts to some of the party.\" \" Were they ?\" said Geoffrey; \" well, so much the better ; I have no taste for indiscriminate slaughter. I like to see the wild creatures on the wing, without feeling it my duty at once to knock them over.\" \" Then it won't exactly be a love of wild sports,\" said Paxton, \" that is taking you to Manitoba ? \""], [244, "236 URIEL. Geoffrey laughed. \" Oh, Manitoba is only a castle in the air,\" he said ; \" I fancy sometimes, when the mood is on me, that a log-hut in the woods and a brush with the bears would be a pleasant way of beginning life over again.\" \" I should say, now,\" said Paxton, \" that one who has begun life so well, and kept it up as successfully as you have done, Mr. Houghton, would make a mistake in thinking of beginning it over again.\" Geoffrey sighed. \" I don't know much about the success,\" he said; \" life, after all, is a heavy sort of business.\" \" To some, no doubt, but surely not to you,\" said Paxton. \" Perhaps you won't believe me serious if I say that my three days at Laventor, the year before last, have left a picture in my mind that I don't care to forget ; a picture of real unmistakeable home-happiness.\" \" Ah, but there have been a precious lot of changes,\" said Geoffrey. \" Laventor is not now exactly what you remember it. My two sisters have married and left us.\" \" Then I should say,\" said Paxton, stopping with great deliberation to light his cigar, \" that the best thing you could do would be to follow their example.\" Geoffrey shook his head. \" I'm not the man to succeed in that class of adventure,\" he said ;"], [245, "A WALK WITH PAXTON. 237 \" I should be more at home with the bears, I fancy.\" \" In other words,\" said Paxton, \" you are going to Manitoba to build a log-hut, shoot bears \u2014 and \u2014 get rid of yourself, if you can ; but that last, my dear Mr. Houghton, is a matter difficult of accomplishment.\" \" I didn't quite mean that,\" said Geoffrey ; \" I was only thinking that there are some days in one's life when one feels as a poor brute of a horse must feel that has to pull its load, with the collar chafing its galled neck, and the roads heavy.\" \" And what advice would you give the animal under such unpromising circumstances ? \" \" I suppose,\" replied Geoffrey, \" one would have to tell him that there's nothing for it but to pull on, and look forward to the stable.\" \" That might do well enough for a horse,\" said Paxton ; \" if a man were in the shafts, something more would be needed.\" \" I don't know, really,\" said Geoffrey ; \" it does not seem a very sublime sort of doctrine ; but on my word, at such times, I think the only thing is to trudge on blindly and doggedly. But it's grim, hard work, if you keep to it, I can tell you ; and at such times, you see, I think of Manitoba.\" \" You are quite right in principle, I am sure,\" said Paxton ; \" the hours you speak of every one knows. Even in Scripture, if I mistake not,"], [246, "238 URIEL there is notice of ' the dark and cloudy day.' At those times one has just nothing for it but to suffer, and to go on suffering ; that is the business to which life is reduced. But there are just two things a man should bear in mind, which a draught horse could not precisely be made to comprehend : first, that sooner or later the bad bit is sure to end ; and, secondly, that when it is ended he will find it to have been a time of progress.\" \" After a plodding, trudging sort of way,\" said Geoffrey. \" Pardon me,\" said Paxton, \" after the way of a winged eagle, of an upsoaring flame, after any thing you like to choose as a comparison to express what is noble, strong, lofty, and enduring. I say again, times like those are times of pro gress. I hate the word, and would use another if I could find one, for as it is commonly used it is just cant. What national progress is I don't pretend to say ; as far as I see, the progress of nations is mostly crab-fashion. But that there is a growth of human souls, I take it, is undeni able, and, believe me, it is in those grim, suffering hours that it is wrought out and perfected.\" \" I say,\" said Geoffrey, \" where did you learn all that ? Is that what they mean by poetry ? \" Paxton laughed. \"As you like to consider, \" he said; \"every man has a book inside him,"], [247, "A WALK WITH PAXTON. 239 called a heart : one may learn a good deal by studying its pages. But, talking of poetry, tell me something of the Pendragons. Their story was the nearest thing to a living poem I ever remember alighting on. This Uriel \u2014 you and I, you know, had something to do with his restora tion \u2014 was he worth all the trouble we took about him ? \" Geoffrey sighed. \" Uriel is worth anything we could have done for him,\" he said ; \" a noble fellow ! but, poor lad, his day is over. His life boat service finished him off, and in his last expedition he got a terrible blow, which injured the lungs, as they fear now, past remedy.\" \" Ah, that is sad,\" said Paxton ; \u2014 \" and the beautiful Aurelia, is she really to be a duchess ? \" \" I know nothing about it,\" said Geoffrey, \" beyond what you heard last night. Julian told me, in one of his letters, that the duke had taken Uriel for a cruise in his yacht, and that they hoped that it would benefit him. Quite possible.\" \" I see,\" said Paxton. \" So the spirit of change has invaded Merylin, no less than Laventor.\" \" Ay, indeed,\" said Geoffrey, \" that it has. You know what it was, as you remember it. People were fond of calling it gloomy and melan choly, and so forth. It was never so to me. From my boyhood I had been used to the old"], [248, "URIEL. 240 place, and loved every tree in the pine-woods, and every stone in the walls ; there was not so much as a shadow in the courtyard that did not seem to me as a familiar friend. Now the place is shut up and deserted. I never pass it without a chill, as though it were a grave where something lay dead and buried.\" \" I see,\" said Paxton again, and indeed he was seeing far more than Geoffrey guessed or in tended. \" Yes, it is quite true ; the world is all over full of places, where such graves lie hidden ; graves of the past, graves of our hopes, graves of our affections. The world, no doubt, is just a big cemetery ; still, Mr. Houghton, we must plant it and cover it over, and bury our dead out of our sight ; else, you know, there would be no living in it. But I was asking about the Pen dragons ; if this poor Uriel dies, the family be comes extinct, does it not, and the old prophecy turns out to be a humbug ? \" \" No, not extinct,\" said Geoffrey ; \" there is his son \u2014 ' the little Uriel,' as they call him \u2014 a lovely little fellow enough, chatters French like a monkey. His mother, you see, was a Breton peasant-girl whom Uriel married at St. Florian.\" \" A peasant-girl ! \u2014 his mother ! \" cried Paxton. \" So there it is, the prophecy complete ! What a strange, bewitching story ! So, after all, it"], [249, "A WALK WITH PAXTON. 241 will not be the ' fallen heir ' who rebuilds the house, but his son, the ' peasant-born ' Uriel.\" They had come to the end of their walk by this time, and were returning to Swinburne. \" It has been a splendid walk, and a splendid talk,\" said Paxton ; \" though I'm half afraid I've taken on me too much of the spiritual director. I even feel prompted not to leave you without a parting word, if you would not be offended.\" \" Oh, no fear of that,\" said Geoffrey. \" Fire away ; \u2014 no one is offended with his director.\" \" Well, only this,\" said Paxton ; \" don't fling the best years of your life away over shadows, Mr. Houghton. If a fair lady has a mind to be a duchess, were I in your place I would let her, and give her my blessing.\" Geoffrey laughed. \" Oh, it's not that,\" he said ; \" duchess or no duchess makes no odds to me. That is not my difficulty.\" \" I am glad to hear it,\" replied Paxton ; \"then there is less reason for your going to Manitoba. Take my advice, Mr. Houghton, sit under the shadow of your own vine and your own fig-tree at Laventor, and leave the backwoods to our young scapegraces. Home life among your own people is the life for you.\" Q"], [250, "242 CHAPTER XXIII. COMING HOME. On his return to Laventor Geoffrey found await ing him a letter from Julian. It gave news of the party at Naples, and was written in his usual style of animation. \" All the world is here,\" he wrote ; \" and all the world is trying hard to enrol Mary and me among its wicked company. I have my fears they may succeed with Mary : she likes it all so amazingly. She carries me off to recep tions and dances, and tries to persuade me that I like it as much as she does, whereas I regard it all as abomination. We have the best of society here (as they would say at Swinburne) ; you can't indulge in a quiet donkey ride without meeting half Belgravia, including, as of course you know, the Duke. He and Uriel have come back from their cruise, and are pretty often together. Our three golden-haired friends, by-the-by, are quite the rage ; you know what fair hair is in the eyes of the Neapolitans. The boy can't walk out with his nurse without being mobbed, and I hear the ' non Angli sed Angeli? wrung the changes"], [251, "COMING HOME. 243 on till one is tired of it. I fear poor Uriel is not yet much the better for the change, and Aurelia tells me he is counting the hours till he can return to Merylin.\" This was the resume' of most of the letters that reached him through the winter, whether from Julian or Mary. They told him of their joyous life together ; they described their excursions by sea and land ; they seldom wrote without speak ing also of Uriel and his sister ; and the burden of what they said was generally the same ; Uriel was fading fast, and they sometimes feared he would never return to Merylin. At last, towards the end of March, came a letter in another handwriting, and opening it hastily, Geoffrey's heart beat fast as he glanced at the sig nature. It was brief, and ran as follows : \u2014 \" My dear Mr. Houghton, \u2014 My poor brother is considerably worse ; and it is but too evident that this climate has been of no real benefit to him. He is longing to be at home again, and though I feel it is a risk for him to encounter an English spring, yet, alas! the risk of staying heremay be yet greater. His own anxiety is lest he may remain until return is impossible, and with that longing which is the character of his complaint, he has set his heart on dying at Merylin ; so that we propose coming back about a fortnight hence, and I write to ask"], [252, "URIEL 244 if you would undertake to see that everything is as it should be. I should dread the journey more than I can say ; but when Julian and Mary heard what we had decided, with their usual kindness, they offered to accompany us. Julian will take on himself the management of the journey. It is so like him ; I never can be sufficiently grateful. \u2014 Yours ever, Aurelia Pendragon.\" There was also a note from Julian. \" Dear Geoffrey,\u2014 Uriel is dying: he cannot live many months \u2014 perhaps not many weeks longer. His one thought is to be at home, and Aureha has ceased to oppose it. Mary and I have made up our minds to travel with them, as it will be a business getting him to England, and we have not the heart to leave Aureha to face it all alone. So we shall be back before we intended. Can you take us in at Laventor ? Somehow I should like to be near the dear fellow to the last ; and I suppose you'll put up with Mary for a bit. By-the-by, I had a letter from Paxton the other day. He spoke of you and Manitoba, and said we ought not to allow it. What's in the wind, old fellow ? Wait to see us before you pack up. Mary says it's the dumps, but that she'll cure you. \u2014 Yours ever, Julian.\" \" Mary home again ; that will be splendid ! \""], [253, "COMING HOME. 245 Such was Geoffrey's exclamation over the break fast-table, uttered with an animation which took his mother by surprise. \" My dear boy, how you startle one,\" she said ; \" and what do you mean ? I thought they meant to stay abroad till June ; \u2014 are they really coming directly ? \" \" Yes, all of them,\" said Geoffrey, swallowing his tea with great vehemence, \" and I must go up to the Castle and see about it.\" Then rising he bestowed on his mother a most unwonted caress, and left the room, saying, \" You'll think about everything else, mother. Mary home again ; my word, but that will be jolly ! \" It had been his first thought, and the immediate effect on his spirits had been like the sudden darting of the sun's rays from behind a dark bank of cloud. But as he toiled up the hill towards the Castle, and remembered what it was that was bringing them back, his feelings speedily sobered, and he could not but think with dismay of the sorrowful time that lay before them, and the untimely end of the young and hapless Sir Uriel. We shall not dwell on the fortnight's prepara tions ; they kept Geoffrey busily employed, for he desired to make the old place smile a welcome on Aurelia and her brother, and was at the same time continually receiving fresh inspirations as"], [254, "246 URIEL to something that Mary would like to see done at Laventor. Between the two subjects of solicitude his time was pretty well engaged, and he had succeeded in working off a fair proportion of the dumps. It was a gleamy, fitful, bewitching April day when the carriage bearing the travellers entered the gates of Merylin, and ascended slowly through the pine woods to the Castle. The pines and larches were beginning to bud and send forth their exquisite perfume, the ground beneath them was bright with primroses and blue-bells, and the birds were clamouring their joyful notes on every branch. There was a sound in the air of tinkling rills of running water, and further off the deeper, more solemn undertone of the sea. Uriel leaned from the window to drink it all in with eye and ear. \" Home ! home ! \" he murmured, \" home as I remember it in our childish days, Aureha : every scent, every sound the same. Those young larches, how sweet they are ; and the thrushes \u2014 there are no thrushes like them in Italy ! \" He sank back with such a light on his faded cheeks that a ray of hope darted through Aurelia's heart. \" It will do you good, dear Uriel ! \" she said ; \" after all, ' there is no place like home.' \" He smiled, but did not speak again till the carriage stopped at the entrance of the Castle, and Geoffrey appeared ready to greet them. He"], [255, "COMING HOME. 247 was not alone, for Julian and Mary had driven on before, that they too might be there to receive the invalid and his sister. The tall, wasted form descended from the carriage and leant on Geoffrey's strong arm for support. So leaning they led him into the an tique chamber, as bright and cheery as Geoffrey's utmost care had been able to make it ; and one and all gathered round him as he sank into the easy chair placed ready to receive him, to bid him \" welcome home.\" Then for the first time Geoffrey looked well at him and beheld the change. Every trace was gone of the iron frame and stal wart bearing for which Uriel Pendragon had once been so distinguished. The face which Julian had depicted in its glorious youth, almost terrible in its majestic strength, bore only one expression now \u2014 that of surpassing sweetness. The golden hair indeed was unchanged, and fell in thick masses over the thin transparent features, making the large eyes look larger still, as they rested on one or other of those who clustered around him. \" So glad,\" he said, \" so happy to be back ; all right now, Aureha.\" At the sound of her name Geoffrey turned his gaze towards her, and thought that she, too, was altered. Something of the calm cold majesty was gone, and a softer, less exalted character was dis tinguishable in her beautiful countenance. In"], [256, "248 URIEL. fact, two influences had been at work in Aurelia's heart, and had entirely absorbed it ; a tender, anxious solicitude for her brother, on every change in whose condition she hung with suspense ; and a mother's care for the little Uriel. When they had seen the invalid fairly settled, Julian and Mary took their leave, and delivered themselves over to Geoffrey to be carried back in triumph to Laventor. On their home greetings we need not enlarge, but leave it to the reader to imagine with what feelings Geoffrey that evening surveyed his family circle, and the immense con tent with which he once more beheld \" old Mary \" in her place beside him. Next morning she found her way into his study, and was received with renewed assurances on Geoffrey's part that it was \" simply splendid.\" \" So it is,\" said Mary ; \" but now, Geff, pre pare to have your conscience examined. We saw Mr. Paxton in London, you know, and he has been telling tales.\" \" I doubt he has been inventing them, then,\" said Geoffrey ; \" it's the way of those poet gentle men. He had no tales to tell.\" \" Yes, but he had ; all about your giving the pheasant-shooters a slice of your mind ; and of a tremendous walk you had together, and all he thought of you.\" \" And what was he pleased to think ? \" growled Geoffrey; \" much I care.\""], [257, "COMING HOME. 249 \" He thoughts of course, that you were a deli cious old bear, as you always were, you know ; but I gathered from his words that you had been decidedly dumpy.\" \" And whose fault was that ? \" said Geoffrey ; \" whilst you have been gallivanting it at Naples, and I don't know where, I have had nothing to comfort me but the pigs and the mill \u2014 we've new roofed it, by-the-by ; Jones did it, and you'll say it's capital.\" \" But mamma has told me of a lot besides the pigs and the mill,\" said Mary ; \" that you never let her take her half hour's constitutional alone, that you looked after her hyacinth bulbs, aired her shawl, I think she said, and read to her in the evenings. Really, Geff, that is the most wonderful part of all to me ; what did you read \u2014 \u25a0 was it ' Challoner ' ? \" \" Never you mind what we read,\" said Geoffrey; \" we hadn't you or Gertrude to pick holes, so we got along famously. But now, look here, Mary, what do you really think of Uriel ? \" Mary's face at once became grave. \" There is but one thing to think,\" she said, \" he may linger, you can never tell how long, in that complaint ; but he will never see another winter.\" Geoffrey was silent for a minute or two. \" And Aurelia ? \" he said. \" I am afraid,\" said Mary, \" she clings to hope against hope, and against her own judgment."], [258, "URIEL. 250 She is wrapt up in him and in the child, and has not a thought beyond them.\" \" Indeed,\" said Geoffrey a little gruffly, \" we heard, \u2014 I was told, \u2014 she had some very decided views beyond them. Was there not something going on with the duke ? They told me so at Swinburne.\" \" Oh, that got to Swinburne, did it ? \" said Mary, whose quick woman's intuition was not slow in perceiving that the report, and probably also Geoffrey's way of receiving it, had not escaped Paxton's notice. \" Small blame to the duke if it came to nothing ; I believe he did his best in the matter, but, as Julian phrased it, he was nowhere from the beginning.\" \" You mean that Aurelia did not encourage it ? \" said Geoffrey. \" Yet he's a Catholic, and a good sort of body, I am told.\" \" Oh yes,\" replied Mary, \" good enough in his way, but if he were not a duke no one would think anything about him ; and you know that sort of thing is no recommendation to Aurelia. If she is ever to be won, it will be by something better than a duke's coronet.\" \" I see,\" said Geoffrey ; \" Swinburne gossip. So now, Mary, put on your thing-a-me-jig \u2014 I can't call it a bonnet \u2014 and let us go out and look about us. You'll like to see the mill.\""], [259, "251 CHAPTER XXIV. SUNSET. The return to Merylin seemed to have a reviving effect on Uriel's health, and for a week or two he gave hopes of regaining some degree of strength. As long as the improvement lasted he used it to go about the place, so dear to him, driving some times to his farms and cottages, seeing the old people who remembered him as a boy, saying a kind word to every one, and always thinking of something to be done for their comfort or benefit. At these times he liked to have Geoffrey with him ; for Geoffrey knew each stick and roof-tree on the estate, and could give him the date when every pig-sty had been rebuilt and every farmhouse repaired. From old and young he heard the same tale, what a good friend Master Houghton had been to the tenants in poor Sir Michael's time ; and how he had managed to restore order when things had gone wrong, and the farm buildings had all been tumbling to ruin. Wherever he went, and whoever he saw, they all bore witness"], [260, "URIEL 252 to the worth, the integrity, the kind good heart, and the power of work which lay in him, who, as his father had bid him never forget, had been a son to him in his trouble. So April blushed and budded into May, and every day Aurelia's hopes grew stronger. \" You will see,\" she said, \" as the warm weather comes he will lose his cough : Naples must really have done him good after all ; we shall keep him with us a little longer.\" But, alas ! as so many have made sad experience, the warm weather when it came only stole away each day a little more of Uriel's strength. Gradually the fallacious promise of improvement faded : it had been but the result of his joy at returning home, and in a week or two he had slipped back to his former level, and the wan cheeks looked more transparent than ever. The drives had to be given up now ; he could only take a few turns on the terrace that over looked the sea, and to this spot at last his out door life became limited. At one end of this terrace was the door of the chapel, which coming and returning he never failed to visit ; at the other, well sheltered from the sun and wind, they placed his couch, where he lay sometimes for hours, quiet and silent, gazing at tho sea, as it broke in snowy foam over the rocks below, and listening to its music he had ever loved so dearly. \" I like it better so,\" he said, \" than calm and"], [261, "SUNSET. 253 motionless, as it was at Naples ; those dancing waves, with their joyous voices, they are like old friends, old comrades.\" They seldom or never left him alone, unless it were at times when he called his little Uriel to him, and spoke to him in words which the child in all his after years loved to cherish and re member. Sometimes he liked to have them all around him, \" his brothers and sisters,\" as he called the four ; and though he could not speak for long together, he would look from one to another with his sweet kind smile, and tell them again and again how glad he was to have them with him. When he did speak his words were gathered into their hearts like treasures. For they bespoke a soul so utterly dead to all human desires or regrets, that to him, it was plain, a longer life would only have been a longer exile. Nothing seemed to enter there that could disturb the profound tranquil peace of one who was simply waiting for his summons. So thankful for the past, in which he saw only his deliverance from the thraldom of the world ; so grateful for the present, for the circle of loving hearts that surrounded him ; so well content that for him on earth there should be no future, nothing to drag him back to hopes and deceptions, which had long been to him as dust upon the balance. Every day one or other of them took it by turns"], [262, "254 URIEL to sit by him and see to all his wants. They were all welcomed with loving courtesy, but it soon became evident that none knew so well what was needed in tending the invalid as Geoffrey. Waiting on the sick is a gift, and Geoffrey pos sessed it in perfection. It required a strong arm to lift and support the gigantic frame which could do so little now to help itself ; but Geoffrey's arm was as strong as his touch was gentle. Very soon his presence became almost a necessity to Uriel ; he would look wistfully for his coming, and depend on him with the trustfulness of a child in the hands of its mother, and if any service had to be done which required peculiar dexterity, one and all would generally agree to \" leave it with Geoffrey.\" One day when the others were away, and Julian was sitting alone with Uriel, he remarked that the latter was looking grave and thoughtful, with an expression on his face more nearly re sembling anxiety than he had been used to see there. He scarcely seemed to heed what Julian said, and hadthe air of being absorbed and pre occupied. \" Julian,\" he said, at last, \" I have been thinking about Aurelia ; \u2014 what will she do when I am gone ? A lonely life for her, poor girl, in the old Castle.\" \" Never fear for her,\" said Julian ; \" Aurelia is not like other women. Wherever she is"], [263, "SUNSET. 255 she will make for herself a noble hfe, be sure of that. There is a pillar of strength within her.\" \" I know it,\" said Uriel ; \" still, I wish\" And here he paused. \" You wish what, dear Uriel ? \" said Julian ; \" it is so seldom you seem to have a wish.\" \" Not often indeed,\" replied Uriel ; \" all my wishes in this world are granted : \u2014 all \u2014 save one.\" \" And that is ? \" \" 0 Julian, you must guess, you must see it \u2014 Geoffrey and Aurelia ; if I could but see them as happy as you are, you and Mary ; I am sure about Geoffrey, but he will never speak. I can't be so certain of Aurelia, yet who else could ever be worthy of her ? If I could but leave her in his care, I should indeed die happy.\" Julian reflected. \" I have long felt sure there was something of that sort,\" he said ; \" Paxton gave me a hint about Geoffrey, and you know he has the eyes of an Argus. What are we to do ? A team of horses would never drag Geoffrey for ward in such a business.\" \" Why not ? \" said Uriel. \" Why, if Geoffrey has anything to say, can't he say it ? \" \"Ah, you don't know him yet, if you say that,\" said Julian ; \" his diffidence in himself, or what ever you like to call it, is just monstrous. He"], [264, "256 URIEL. would as soon or sooner think of aspiring to the hand of an empress.\" \" Rubbish,\" said Uriel ; \" I hope it is not all that senseless notion about the rank of the Pen dragons ; we should surely be ashamed of it by this time. Besides, if his sister is one day to be a countess, why on earth should not he be good enough for anybody ? \" \" It is not rank, merely,\" said Julian ; \" but our poor dear Geoffrey does truly and heartily believe himself to be such a dunce in mind, and, above all, such a hobgoblin in person, that I don't think he would ever find courage to propose him self for the acceptance of any lady, let alone your sister.\" \" Then I must find it for him,\" said Uriel ; \" I could not have imagined such a folly would have taken hold of a man of his sense. A dunce, indeed ! why, he has the best head I know of; as clear as crystal, with a princely heart ; and as to his person, why, really, I don't see what's amiss. Look here, now, Julian, we must not let this go on ; if they really do care for one another, we must bring them together. Set Mary at Aurelia, and I'll do my best with Geoffrey.\" Acting in obedience to her husband's orders, Mary tried to open the ground with Aureha, but found all her man\u0153uvres frustrated with a"], [265, "SUNSET. 257 quiet dignity, which made all renewal of the attack impossible. Uriel, however, was more persistent in his branch of the undertaking. He chose his oppor tunity: a day when Geoffrey had been tending him with his usual care, and when, having arranged his pillows as no one else could arrange them, and lifted him into exactly the most rest ful of all possible positions, he stood beside the couch where Uriel lay, as it seemed more than usually inclined for conversation. \" Can you stay a little ? \" said Uriel ; \" I should be so glad. There is something I wanted to talk about.\" \" All right,\" said Geoffrey, drawing a chair be side him, and expecting to hear something about their plans for the tenants. \" In the first place, there's the boy,\" said Uriel, \" my boy. You know, I have left you and Julian his guardians. You'll make him a brave, true man, like yourself, Geoffrey ; that is all I care for.\" \" I will do my best,\" said Geoffrey, falling back on the old familiar phrase, \" and Julian will do his. In Julian's hands he can't go wrong; he will teach him everything.\" \" But I want him to be in your hands, Geof frey,\" said Uriel ; \"I want you to make him a strong, true, honest man.

I did not think you had any such fancies, and you must banish them. If you see what I never meant that any one should see, you will understand me when I tell you that the best thing I can do with myself, by and by, is to go to Manitoba. I must clear out of this, and begin hfe somewhere over again. Last winter made me feel that to go on alone at Laventor, after all that has been, is more than I have strength for.\" \" Listen to me, Geoffrey,\" said Uriel, as soon as he could get in a word, \" listen to me, and"], [267, "SUNSET. 259 don't be a simpleton. Time with me is too short for much circumlocution. If you care for Aurelia, as I beheve you do, tell her so.\" Geoffrey shook his head. \" Impossible,\" was his only reply. \"But you do care for her ? \" \" 1 fear so.\" \" Then why don't you speak ? \" \" How can you ask me, Uriel. It isn't kind.\" There was a pause. \" Look here,\" said Uriel, \" should you think it kind, supposing Aurelia cared for you, to let her happiness go to wreck, as well as your own, and all for folly ? \" \" Care for me ! \" said Geoffrey ; \" why, she'd as soon think of caring for a donkey. I wonder at you, Uriel.\" \" How do you know ? Have you ever asked her ? \" \" Certainly not,\" said Geoffrey ; \" you need not have said that, Uriel.\" \" Very well, then, I shall,\" replied Uriel; \" now, not another word, Geoffrey, you see I'm tired. Leave me alone to settle things my own way. I shall speak to Aurelia as soon as ever I see her.\" History does not record what became of Geoffrey during the remainder of that day.

If Aurelia would remain with him, that would be all he should want. Mary remembered that she had promised the child a clamber among the rocks, and declared that Julian must accompany them, to guard against their breaking their necks, or being swallowed up by the tide. They both understood that what Uriel wanted was an hour with Aurelia, secure from all chance of interrup tion, and had little difficulty in guessing how he would employ it. \" How Ury is growing ! \" said Aurelia, as she watched the three set forth together ; \"I was afraid he promised to be more a fairy than a giant ; but he is getting at last to look like a rosy-cheeked English' boy.\" \" That is what I should like him to be,\" said Uriel ; \" national vanity is an odious thing, but, for all that, the English type is a grand one when you can get it.\" \" What do you call the English type ? \" said Aurelia ; \"it seems to me we are all so diffe rent.\" \" But with something that is alike in our difference,\" said Uriel, \" truth, fidelity, a sort of a sticking to duty \u2014 you see it in our very rail way guards. It is something that wears better than a world of fine feathers.\""], [269, "SUNSET. 261 \" Very true,\" replied Aurelia ; \" I never cared much for fine feathers, as you know.\" \" Yes, I do know,\" said Uriel ; \" and I'm glad of it. And that just fits in with something I want to talk about, Aurelia ; will you listen ? \" \" What a question, Uriel ! listen to you ? I should think so.\" \" Very well, then don't be vexed if I come straight to the point; you know I haven't strength for a lot of preliminaries. It is about Geoffrey.\" \" What about him ? \" said Aurelia, in a voice in which an attentive ear would have discerned a tone of rather over careful tranquillity. \" Do you want him ? \" \" No, I want you just now, and no one else. See here, Aurelia, Geoffrey's future is in your hands ; you are not going to throw him overboard, are you ? \" Aurelia looked at her brother, and only said : \" Throw him overboard ! I don't know what you mean, Uriel ; \u2014 what have I got to do with Mr. Houghton's future ? \" \" Everything, Aurelia,\" he replied ; \" if you don't see how it is with him you have no eyes ; his happiness is in your hands, and you are not what I take you for if you can sacrifice it.\" Aurelia paused for a moment, then she said : \" I think, Uriel, one should be truthful and straightforward in these things, as in everything"], [270, "262 URIEL else. Mr. Houghton has never so much as hinted at such a thing as you imply. Once, indeed, and only once \u2014 it was when Julian and Mary's affair came to light \u2014 I thought he spoke a little unhke his usual self, but it was nothing, you know. He has never given me so much as a word or a sign, and, so you see, there is no more to be said about it.\" \" I beg your pardon, there is a great deal more to be said,\" replied Uriel ; \" he won't speak because \u2014 well, I really can't explain it \u2014 he seems to fancy no one would ever think of him. Most absurd, I should say, only you can't make him see it. But yesterday I forced it all out of him, and I told him plainly if he did not choose to speak, / should ; so, now, I want your answer.\" But no answer came, and after a few minutes Uriel sighed, as one disappointed. \" Ah, well,\" he said, \" I see I was mistaken. 1 am sorry now I forced his confidence, poor fellow. Forget what I have said, Aurelia ; it must not make a diffi culty between you. To my thinking, he has the noblest heart in all England ; but, I see how it is, he is not enough of a hero for a woman to care for.\" \" No, no, Uriel, you must not say that,\" said Aurelia, her marble-like reserve giving place to a warmer rush of generous feeling. \" His is, indeed, a noble heart, and if all you say is true it doubly"], [271, "SUNSET. 263 proves it. When he fancied I was thinking of another, his only thought was how to make me happy. He has never thought of himself, never. Geoffrey Houghton is the only living man I could call a hero.

He had approached them while she was speak ing, and at a gesture from Uriel had remained standing, and had heard her last words. \" Now Heaven be praised that you understand one another at last,\" said Uriel, sinking back on his couch, as one whose heart was relieved of a heavy weight. \" My last earthly wish is granted, and now I can die happy ! \" Uriel Pendragon lived about three weeks after the event we have just recorded. In the pro spect of his sister's future marriage with Geoffrey Houghton he saw the fulfilment of all his hopes, and a security both for her happiness and the guardianship of his httle Uriel. His cup, as he said, overflowed with gladness ; he could only count up his mercies, and give thanks to God and the angels."], [272, "264 URIEL As to Geoffrey and Aurelia, their great joy came to them sobered and chastened by the thought of their coming sorrow. Their long wooing, if we may call it such, had been but little after the fashion of the world ; and its happy issue could never now be disconnected in their minds with the memory of the last weeks, the last days of Uriel's earthly existence. The solemn sweetness of those last days entered into both their hearts, and knit them closer to one another. It is a nameless pleasure, as a poet has sung, \" to watch the sunset with the eyes we love ; \" and as they sat beside the couch of their dying brother, one thought often filled their minds \u2014 that it was like a beautiful golden sun set. For some weeks he had been unable to leave his room ; all the rites of Holy Church had been performed, and from day to day they could only watch and wait \u2014 wait for the eyes to close upon earth and open in heaven. The ineffable sweetness of those days, each one of which they feared would be the last, may be guessed by such as have known such a time of waiting ; it is a sweetness unlike anything else in this world, and has nothing of this world about it. One day he seemed to revive a little from the exhaustion in which he had lately lain, and greeted those who came to him with a smile that"], [273, "SUNSET. 265 was almost gay. \" So much better,\" he said ; \"I am longing for the terrace ; I want once more to feel the sea air upon my forehead.\" \" But you are not equal to it, dear Uriel,\" said his sister. \" Oh yes, I am ; it is only this sick-room life I cannot bear. You remember that German story of the dying knight who called for his war horse. The life-boat was my war-horse ; I feel just now as if I could guide it among the breakers. Let me look at the sea once more, the beautiful sea ! \" In order to save him the fatigue of mounting the stairs, they had arranged for his use a chamber on the ground floor ; so that Julian and Geoffrey, taking him in their arms, found no difficulty in carrying him to the terrace. \" Let him have his wish,\" they said, \" why should we deny him ! \" He looked his thanks, as, with the utmost tenderness, they laid him on his couch. \" So glad,\" he murmured, \" so glad to be here. Are you all here, too ? Uriel and Father Adrian ? \" Yes, they were all there, and the child, who had been playing on the terrace, came to his father's side, and nestled close to him, holding in his hands a bunch of roses he had just gathered. \" My roses, papa,\" he said, \" won't you have them ? \""], [274, "266 URIEL. Uriel took the roses, and thanked the giver with one of his bright, loving smiles, then he lay silent for a while, looking at the sea, as it lay stretched out before him, with its intense blue, studded over with white sails, and sparkling breakers. \" The beautiful sea ! \" he repeated again ; \" how I have loved it ! But I am going where there will be no more sea ; only the crystal one before the throne of God, and the angels' wings reflected in it ! Angele Dei ! \" and his voice sank to a whisper, but they saw his lips moving, and in their hearts they all joined in the prayer he was uttering. Presently his counten ance changed, and Geoffrey, who was supporting his head, looked towards the chaplain. Suddenly and quickly the last summons had come. Father Adrian understood the sign, and began the prayers for the departing soul ; whilst here and there Uriel seemed to join as though he was conscious of all that was passing. It was a brief half hour, and then they all knew that his release had come, and their tears flowed fast as they beheld him lying with that wondrous smile of peace upon his lips ; one hand pressing the crucifix to his breast, and the other still holding the bunch of summer roses. w V- Our story is ended, and what remains to tell"], [275, "SUNSET. 267 will be supplied by the imagination of our readers. Uriel was laid to rest among the tombs of his fathers in the Chapel of the Angels, and accord ing to one of his last requests, the union of his sister with Geoffrey Houghton was not long de layed. The question, however, had first to be decided as to their future residence. Was it to be at Laventor or Merylin ? The little Sir Uriel was to be under their care, and it seemed as if he, the last heir of his house, ought to grow up to manhood in his father's home, and with all the associations of a Pendragon. But Aurelia would not hear of it. \" Geoffrey shall never be asked to live in any but his own home,\" she said ; \" Uriel wished his son to be brought up by Geoffrey's hand ; and under Geoffrey's direction. He can only do that by his own hearth, and living in his own manner. Besides, I am longing for Laventor.\" \" My dear,\" said Mrs. Houghton, who was present at the family council, \" I am afraid it will be a great change for you. What can you find at Laventor to please you after Merylin ? \" \" For one thing,\" replied Aurelia, taking the old lady's hand, and kissing it tenderly, \" I shall find \u2014 a mother ! \" \" Ay, Aurelia,\" said Geoffrey, \" a mother and a home are not bad things to begin with. And you are right : I should not be myself anywhere"], [276, "268 URIEL but at Laventor. But how about Merylin ? It must be shut up, I suppose, till Uriel comes of age, and that won't be for fourteen years. It will be dull for the old place ; I'm sorry.\" \" I am thinking,\" said Julian, \" here are Mary and I, homeless and houseless vagrants. Why should not we hire the place, and keep out the owls and bats till Sir Uriel takes possession ? We must live somewhere, and I should like no place so well. There I could still keep an eye on the life-boats.\" \" Aurelia at Laventor and I at Merylin ! \" said Mary, \" what a strange idea ! Do you remember, Aurelia, how you talked once, and declared you loved our little bird's nest better than all the towers of the Pendragons ? How little then either of us guessed that we should ever be exchanging places ! \" \" I remember,\" said Aurelia ; \"it was the day I came to speak to Geoffrey about the chapel. And he asked Juhan ; and it was Julian's cartoon that found Uriel. How wonderful it has all been ; but it all began with the restoration of the chapel.
