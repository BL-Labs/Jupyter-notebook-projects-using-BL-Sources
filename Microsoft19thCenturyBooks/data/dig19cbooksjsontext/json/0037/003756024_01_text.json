However, he will remember \u2014 or I shall remind him \u2014 that he introduced me to Mr. Marrynett himself. For you know how often I have told you the first time I ever saw Marrynett, was when he came with the deputa tion from the corporation, wanting uncle to sell them a piece of land quite within the hall grounds, to build a new county lunatic asylum on. He was in a great fury then, but too much the gen tleman to show it, \u2014 uncle is a gentleman always, that's certain, \u2014 and for all that, asked them to lunch, and I presided, of course, though I believe he did not intend I should. And the next time I saw him, you know, was when uncle allowed us to go to Liverpool with Mrs. Primmer to hear the bishop of Doublechester preach a sermon on behalf of the Sailors' Orphans' Society. I pretended I wanted to hear such a famous preacher, but in reality I had seen Mr. Marry nett's name at the top of the list of the people getting the thing up.

But his horrid wife was alive then, and leading him her dreadful dance. Just see how he dresses now to please me ; there's nothing he thinks too fine or expensive. But how he did stare at me in re- turn till I remembered him, and how delighted he was to be recognized before the whole church by people from Featherstone Hall !

To be sure, uncle knew nothing about that ; but he can't forget that I saw him a second time again, under his own eye, at Featherstone, when Marrynett made himself such a funny errand here, to bother him about building a cotton cleaning mill, and using uncle's best trout stream for the purpose ; for uncle got quite into a pas sion that time, and as good as told him to walk off, and never annoy him again by a visit after such objects. Of course it was all a pretence that time. Marrynett knew beforehand uncle had no more power over his property than I have, in consequence of the entail taking it to quite distant people of the name. But his drunken wife had just finished herself off with her bottles, and he wanted to let me see he had not forgotten me, besides sending me the Liverpool paper with her death in it, underlined in red ink. That was what spoilt poor Malton's chances most ; but you know how we managed all the rest of it, and got so fond of steaming over to Birkenhead, to watch the wonderful improvements going on there ! \""], [25, "17 3 HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS PROPOSAL. Both sisters laughed at this, and Miss Philip pina, linking her waist in her sister's by their crossed arms behind, made the happy suggestion, \" In that case, dear, as uncle has such out-of-the way ideas himself, I dare say he can be made to believe you and Marrynett fell in love at first sight ; for I am quite sure he would never for give you if he thought you were going to marry for money only. But stay, that won't do either, as the wife was alive at the time.\" \" I don't think I shall invent any excuse, Flippy,\" the elder sister replied, \" I am perfectly of an age to act for myself \u2014 twenty-seven, you know, dear, last birthday, though I only confess to twenty-four to Marrynett \u2014 mind that ; it makes you two years younger also \u2014 for fear he should take it into his head I am marrying him because I can get nobody else. After all, what right can uncle have to be so surprised or vexed, when he knows he has no fortunes to give us to do better ? But I imagine he thinks he shall live for ever and we with him.

Ferdinand Featherstone, Esq., of the Haugh, was, in fact, too wedded to his own opinions and notions of all kinds to be likely to change what had become a settled hereditary article of belief in his class and order of men, concerning the baleful progress and influence of the com mercial and manufacturing interests, which, rising up in the form of half a hundred new towns, bristling with giant chimneys, and black with smoke, had for well on a century, then, been casting the rural and agricultural districts and landowners of Lancashire into shadow and insignificance. Conservative, or rather old Tory, gentleman as he was by birth, by politics, by tastes and convictions, the speculative and adventurous movement of the times appeared to Ferdinand Featherstone, Esq., instinct only with ruinous change in all its modifications, like the tumultuous stirrings of an earthquake, destined finally to engulf all above and below. And while his own angry belief in the instability and"], [35, "27 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. destructive results of the new energy at work, no less than the cramping feudal tenure of his property, prevented him from all chance of sharing the prosperity diffused around its grand centres of industrial action, he contemplated with ever-growing indignation how completely the surprising fortunes heaped up close at hand by trade dwarfed the greatness and con sideration which a landed proprietor of so many centuries' standing had always previously felt himself born to inherit. Meanwhile, though the Featherstone property was so strictly entailed, Mr. Featherstone, among his other oddities, appeared to make no effort to retain it in his own line of descent, remaining to now, a ripe maturity, a bachelor. Why he continued unmarried, with his ad vantages, was not unfrequently a subject of condemnation and ridicule with divers ladies, his contemporaries, who conceived themselves to have a vested interest in the question, being of the families from which the Featherstones, of the Haugh, had from time immemorial been wont to take their wives. Yet nearly all of them knew that one of their number had in-"], [36, "28 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. flicted a severe disappointment on Mr. Feather stone in his younger days, jilting him for the sake of one of these new grandees of trade, whose wealth out-dazzled every other claim. But it might as probably be that the miseries he had witnessed in the conjugal relation in his own family, indisposed the Squire of the Haugh to take upon himself a similar disastrous yoke; while some credit might reasonably be given to him for a generous forbearance from en gaging himself in personal interests of the kind, at the expense of responsibilities he had taken upon him in the shape of a numerous brood of destitute relations, who had now for a long period nestled under his wing at the Haugh. These were the Clanbrasseys, nieces and nephews of Mr. Featherstone, by their mother, his only sister: five young persons in all \u2014 three daughters and two sons. Kilpatrick Henry, Charlotte, Philippina, Desmond, and Rosanna Maria, were the names of these collaterals ; who, from a very early period of their crea tion, were rather unfairly, it must be confessed, quartered on the generosity of that kind \" uncle \" of theirs."], [37, "29 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. Very unfairly, one may say. Mr. Feather stone was in no way a consenting party to the advent of these numerous Clanbrasseys on the stage of wantful existence. On the contrary. The handsome blackguard Irish Captain of Dragoons, who took upon himself the office of conferring them on the world, eloped with the sister of Mr. Featherstone, of the Haugh, in the teeth of a direct refusal from the brother, who declined the alliance of a notorious rake and blackguard gambler of the turf, with rea sonable peremptoriness. But the good looks, and honeyed tongue, and reckless audacity of the lover, proved more than a match for the warnings and vigilance of the well-meaning, but certainly somewhat injudicious brother, who adopted the simple expedient of the good old times to preserve his relative by locking her up in her own apartment at the Hall. The win dows of this place of safety were found not too high for the lamplighter's ladder, used one dark midnight, to set the young lady at liberty in the arms of her fond and faithful Hibernian swain. So she believed him ; and her brother had found it impossible to convince her to the con-"], [38, "30 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. trary ; although, assuredly, Miss Featherstone had never been much admired for her beauty before the Honourable Patrick Kilpatrick Clan brassey (he was an Irish peer's second or third son) made the discovery, with the addition \u2014 at a time most opportune to his affairs \u2014 that she was entitled to a fortune of ten thousand pounds, in her own right, by her grandmother's will. But what woman could ever be convinced on such a point, though all the glasses in the universe had arrayed themselves in tbe same sense? Mr. Featherstone only exasperated his sister into greater contumacy by his earnest en deavours to persuade her it was impossible her persona] charms could be the attractions of her Hibernian wooer. This runaway match resulted as unhappily as could possibly have been predicted by any pro phet of evil, or other competent observer of similar fatalities. The Honourable Paddy Kil paddy (as he was most frequently styled) ran through his wife's property, and what remained of his own scanty inheritance, in a very brief space of time. Disgusted then with the poverty he had brought on himself, and disdaining the"], [39, "THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. 31 restraints placed by his wife's jealousy and re sentment on his accustomed licentious diver sions, he commenced a course of ill-treatment of the poor woman, which led to endless quar rels and I don't know how many separations, patched up somehow or other, until a great crowning scandal came to pass. Mrs. Clan brassey discovered an intrigue between her hus band and a married woman, the wife of one of his brother officers, and her own particular friend. But, still more scandalously availing himself of the pretext that she had ruined him by exploding the affair publicly, the Honourable Captain refused to contribute in any manner to his fugitive wife's subsistence away from him. And it was true, the poor gentleman was cast in an action brought against him by the be reaved husband in heavy damages, not one farthing of which he ever paid. But he had to take refuge in a foreign country for a long while, leaving his children absolutely destitute of any species of provision, to the charity of rela tions or the parish \u2014 he seemed not to care which. Under these circumstances, Mr. Featherstone, who had long been compelled to mix himself"], [40, "32 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. up in his sister's stormy matrimonial affairs, offered her and her children an asylum in the house the former had so inauspiciously aban doned. Very possibly he did not apprehend at the time \u2014 having had frequent experience of the as sudden and irrational reconciliations as quarrels of the pair \u2014 that he had taken upon himself more than a temporary arrangement of the kind. But Captain Clanbrassey, finding, after his last grand peccadillo, there were no further hopes of Mr. Featherstone standing the racket of his in famous game, was by no means inclined to re sume the society of an ugly wife on principles of duty and allegiance merely. Quite other wise ; he made his detected paramour the part ner of his flight ; and when remonstrated with on the score that, at least, his children had claims upon his parental cares, contented him self for all reply by inviting them to the dis reputable continental resort, where this lady pre sided over his domestic bliss, and where he exercised the industry of a professional gambler. Without any fault of his own, Mr. Feather stone thus found himself become the sole pro-"], [41, "33 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. tector and companion of a despairing, peevish in- valid \u2014 the deserted but still hankering wife of an \" exile of Erin,\" of the stamp indicated. But he was a man of great tenderness of heart and com- passionateness of disposition, in spite of a some- what rugged outer crust of apparent misan- thropy and domineering. The Clanbrasseys were nearly all good-looking young persons, and naturally attracted a kinsman's partiality in that respect. Even the one least gifted in external beauty, either in reality or in the good Squire's fancy, was a girl of intellectual capacity, and greatly resembled a mother whom he had fondly loved, and who remained in his memory the model of every household and womanly virtue. His own disappointment had been so thorough, that it had given him a distaste for matrimonial ideas in his proper person. No obstacle there fore existed to the reinstatement of his sister at the Hall, after her some fourteen or fifteen years of unhappy absence. But Mrs. Clanbrassey 's spirits were entirely broken, and her health undermined, by the moral and physical sufferings she had under gone in her married career; and after a few VOL. I. 3"], [42, "34 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. years of querulous, moaning existence, she died. Possibly even \u2014 such is the folly of womankind \u2014 sinking: sooner than she otherwise needed into her grave, by grief, at the tidings which arrived of her worthless husband's losing his. life in a duel with some German count or other, who presumed to find fault with his particular style of being always a winner at roulette. The Clanbrassey family in general seemed to consider all relationship ended with their son's death, or conceived the most prudent plan would be to let the English relatives of \" poor Kilpatrick's \" children feel they had no other dependence. Old Lord Clanbrassey, his father, had indeed so deeply entangled himself and his property by extravagance, that he had no means, had he been willing, to be of use. His successor was a man of a different turn ; but his needs were as great to support any kind of position on the slender margin of estate left him by all manner of mortgages and encum brances, with the nuisance of a high-sounding title. He had, however, a polite and blarney ing way of doing things ; and when, on re ceiving the notification of the Honourable"], [43, "35 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. Paddy Kilpaddy's demise, Mr. Featherstone wrote to inquire his lordship's views as to the disposal of his brother's children, he replied with a fervid expression of happiness in the knowledge that they could not be in better or kinder hands, and an eloquent flourish of hopes that the blessings of Heaven would continually hover over the head of the noble-hearted and most feeling gentleman to whom Providence had granted means utterly out of his own power, of befriending the bereaved orphans of his late gallant and high-spirited, though misled and erring brother, whose untimely end for ever forbade the expectation that he would re deem the faults of his youth by a glorious career in that profession of arms he had adopted. Mr. Featherstone was not, however, the kind of agent in any case to visit the sins of the father on the children. He was, perhaps, rather pleased with not being called upon to mix him self up in any way with the family of the man whose memory he continued to loathe and despise. He determined, as much as in him lay, to play the part of parent to the deserted orphanage. 3\u20142"], [44, "36 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. But Mr. Featherstone found, after the lapse of no very long period, that he had undertaken a difficult task. What is bred in the bone mostly defies the power of education and ex ample to prevent appearing in the flesh. Their father's blood early showed itself in the veins of his two sons, who were with the greatest difficulty got through a course of decent gentle manly training. One was expelled from Eton, the other from Cambridge. The elder was then put into the army, when his extravagance and escapades continued for a long period the an noyance of Mr. Featherstone's existence. Hap pily, his regiment was now ordered to India. He found it hopeless to try and bring up the second to so decorous a profession as the church, which he had intended, and so the Squire took advantage of a short spell in office of the party he belonged to by hereditary politics and feelings, to get the young gentle man despatched abroad also, on the diplomatic service. With the female part of the family the good uncle persisted in hoping he should prove more successful. Undeniably he had some extraordi-"], [45, "THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. 37 nary crotchets in their case. Fancying that his sister's education in the frivolities of a fashion able boarding-school had been a cause of the want of sense and judgment she had displayed in her career, he determined to give the orphan girls a home education, under his own careful supervision. He procured them, it is true, a highly-recommended governess, and masters of eminence from the neighbouring wealthy city \u2014 with whose aid he thought he could preserve them from the harmful influences of association with the folly and vanity of their sex. He even devoted much time and trouble of his own to instilling into them what he himself considered sound views of life, and to training their minds to reason and reflection above the silly pursuits and delights of the average female understand ing. It was making ropes with sand. Among other exceptional theories of Mr. Featherstone, he had a notion that it would be much better for his nieces to live a quiet, un married life with him, than to subject them selves to the pains and penalties their mother's fate led him to consider the necessary concomi tants of matrimony, saving in the rarest in-"], [46, "38 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. stances. He knew he had no fortunes to give them, in consequence of the entail and the con- stant drain upon his resources, sufficient to marry them in the rank to which they belonged by birth ; and Mr. Featherstone, of the Haugh, shrank from the idea of intermarriage with the modern plutocracy in his vicinity, as if it had been with a lower order of animals. By a rigid economy, however, he hoped to save enough to maintain them comfortably in single blessedness whenever so unhappy and (as we are all apt to think) remote a contingency as his own departure should arise. The seclusion in which he lived \u2014 his bookish and rural tastes \u2014 consciousness of his own inability to play the chaperon to marriageable girls, and lack of any desirable substitute \u2014 all combined with his phi- losophical conclusions to make him adopt and persevere in the plan indicated. But Mr. Featherstone made his calculations without taking human and feminine nature suffi ciently into the account ; certainly, at all events, as regarded his eldest niece. Charlotte Clan brassey inherited her father's passion for pleasure and variety \u2014 was of a frivolous, coquettish turn"], [47, "39 THE CLANBRASSEY ANTECEDENTS. by nature, and, with considerable reason for it in external beauty, cherished an inordinate vanity and craving for the admiration and hom age due to the possessors of female loveliness. The retirement in which she was compelled to exist, the restraints put upon her inclinations in so many ways, could only curb their outward action. Inwardly she was consumed with a kind of fever of impatience and revolt under bondage, which, as time went on, increased into a suppressed but ever-burning sense of wrong and unfair treatment. Miss Clanbras sey's severe education, knowledge of her depend ence, and of her uncle's character, rather made her hypocritical than honest. Many were the attempts she had already made, under all these difficulties, to emancipate herself by the only means she ever figured to herself a woman's success could be achieved.

THE FATHER OF THE MARRYNETTS. Mr. Featherstone was a man of slender and delicate proportions, denoting, perhaps, the tenuity quite as much as the purity of the very ancient blood on which he prided himself, in the absence of powerful muscle and brawn in his framework. But he had a remarkably in tellectual and bright-looking face, thin and worn as the features were, and a lustre in the eyes that was very capable, on occasions, of breaking into the sparkle and flash of scornful or indig nant feeling. They were at it in the present instance evidently. On entering the library, which was Mr. Featherstone's favourite retreat when not engaged in his agricultural or sport ing pursuits (he farmed some of his own land,"], [50, "42 THE FATHER OF THE MARRYNETTS. mostly at a loss, and was very fond of field sports) ; Charlotte Clanbrassey perceived at a glance the kind of ordeal she was in for.

But hitherto he had been chiefly distinguished in Liverpool as a citizen of a disagreeably demagogic turn, who was trying to thrust himself into power and pre-eminence by \"pandering\" to the insolence and \" pretended reforming tendencies \" of a party in the town, there and elsewhere denominated by its adversa ries \" the mob.\" Thus far, indeed, it had ever been a favourite boast with Mushroom Marrynett, Esq., and which he even made from the curule chair when, after one of the most vehement struggles that ever rent a corporation, he was raised to the dignity of mayor \u2014 that, to use the words of the haughty Philippina Clanbrassey, he sprang \"from nothing and nobody ! \" Presiding over by no means a profuse inau gural banquet \u2014 for in his earlier times Mush room Marrynett was as conspicuous for economv and frugality as he afterwards became for osten-"], [67, "59 HYMENEALS. tatious expense, and was besides elected on princi ples of retrenchment, not altogether pleasing in this instance to his supporters \u2014 he informed the Liverpool world of the fact, with his own lips, that thirty years previously only he had arrived in their wealthy city a ragged runaway parish-boy.

Nor could it be denied the reasons Mr. Marrynett afterwards assigned for his preference of a lady of Mr. Featherstone's family were strangely at variance with these earlier demo cratic professions. For, on renewing his proposals to Miss Clan brassey's guardian, which on the second occasion were much more courteously received ; having explained to that gentleman that he was a \" widow,\" though with but one child, and that \" only a girl\" \u2014 such were his expressions \u2014 and declaring that he did not expect \" one penny of portion\" with the young lady upon whom he had set his affections, \" which, in point of fact, Mr. Featherstone,\" he said, \" I know you could not afford,\" he proceeded : \" The great reason why I want to marry into your family is for the sake of the good blood in it, sir, and nothing else, though I am greatly attached to Miss Charlotte ; but I Avould never marry a second time merely for love and rubbish of that sort \u2014 vol.

The announcement of the intended alliance passed uncontradicted, though to the mingled wonder, derision, and resent ment of his own friends and associates, as well as the former democratic allies and supporters of Mr. Marrynett, who perceived, or fancied they perceived, a direct case of desertion of them and of their principles in his seeking and ob taining a bride in the family of a conservative county gentleman. It was the Heir of the Revolution pretending to the hand of the daughter of the C\u00e6sars ! But the truth is, Mushroom Marrynett was merely carrying out his own grand principle of action \u2014 a selfish, grasping, parvenu desire to rise to eminence by any means. His party had done all for him they could, he thought, and he cared no longer for their good opinion, or the paltry municipal distinctions (so he had grown to esteem them) they could henceforth bestow. Moreover, though it was not a fact known to many, possibly even to himself, Marrynett's determination to force himself upward in society had received an accelerating lash from a morti- 5\u20142"], [76, "68 I1YMENEALS. fying circumstance that had befallen him not long previously. His junior partner, Sir John Souchong, hap pened when plain Mister to be in office as mayor, and charged to present an address to the throne on an occasion of great importance to the Royal Family, which had procured him the unexpected honour of knighthood. A plain, jolly, good-natured, fresh-complexioned mer chant up to that period, and deferring in all things to the superior judgment of his senior partner, this accession of greatness effected a marked change in Sir John, and disposed him to take upon himself a state and consequence in the city that seemed to overshadow the former pre-eminence of the head of the firm. Mush room Marrynett felt this bitterly, more espe cially as the junior partner's wife, descended from one of the opulent merchant families of the town, and who had previously been content to figure as a leading merchant's Avife in the place, begun to show airs of aristocracy also in the glitter of her new title, and higher displays of peacock pride and superiority to the senior, at the time still more painfully oppressed with"], [77, "69 HYMENEALS. the hopeless homeliness and under-breeding of his first unhappy wife, the marine store-dealer's daughter. But now Mr. Marrynett had secured so well-born, beautiful, and fashionable a prin cess to grace his hearth, he anticipated a thorough outshining of the Souchongs, and restoration to his natural position over his in flated junior partner. Charlotte Clanbrassey herself, meanwhile, knew not well what to make of her uncle's con tinued obligingness in the affair. Not only did he allow Mr. Marrynett to be presented to him as his niece's affianced husband, after their late abrupt interview ; he most politely wished him joy of the excellent choice he had made. Even, it was said, condescended to apologize for having expressed a doubt of the reality of the information conveyed to him by Mr. Marrynett, on the subject of his previous acceptance by his niece ; and Mr. Marrynett felt greatly flattered, though the bride-elect bit her pouting red under lip \u2014 an usual action with her to make it redder and more pouting, though seldom with such severity as on this occasion, when she bit it till the blood came \u2014 to hear her uncle avow his"], [78, "70 HYMENEALS. present conviction that Miss Clanbrassey had shown herself a much more qualified judge than he himself could ever possibly have been, of the kind of companion in life most suitable to her tastes and wishes, and calculated to make her happy in the most intimate and lasting of human relations. After some puzzle, Charlotte arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Featherstone himself per ceived the advantages of the alliance, and was as great a humbug as anybody else in having always affected a contempt for Liverpool claims on respect. She was always shallow in her reasoning, if ever she could be said to reason at all ; and like most mean-hearted and poor souled people, ascribed her own motives to others. Yet, certainly, it was strange ! Mr. Feather stone expressly licensed Mr. Marrynett's neces sary visits until the wedding could take place, though he seldom appeared on these occa sions. He even went so far as to invite him once to dinner ; and though he pleaded indis position, and left the table early for his study, and the lovers to finish their dessert and toy-"], [79, "71 HYMENEALS. ing with the bride-elect's sisters only to coun tenance them \u2014 and never repeated the opera tion \u2014 enough seemed done to satisfy the Liver pool world that its distinguished member was not thrusting himself upon his eminent alliance without some degree of reception and welcome in it by the proper authorities. While on other points the uncle seemed almost as impatient as the bridegroom could be supposed himself to bring the happy event to its completion. He facilitated everything. He made a wry face, but he assented to Mrs. Primmer's assurance that it was quite impossible the wedding could take place from anywhere but the bride's home in his family mansion. Charlotte herself did not want this, entailing the necessity of the celebration taking place at the parish church of Featherstone also, which she had reasons of her own rather to think in expedient ; and, indeed, Dr. Malton, the vicar and regular clergyman there, did not perform the rite, and there was a gossiping talk of some thing unpleasant in the way of explanations and remonstrances between the mansion and the parsonage that so eventuated. And the truth"], [80, "72 HYMENEALS is, the vicar's son, Edward, came post home from college when he heard the news of the great marriage formed at Featherstone, and being denied access to the young ladies, in a manner forced his way into Mr. Featherstone's presence, with a complaint that added very much to that gentleman's previous annoyance. But Miss Clanbrassey, on being questioned on the points alleged, declared with such unshaken calmness of assurance that nothing had ever taken place between her and young Mr. Malton to justify his accusations of jilting and unfair play, in the smallest degree, that it seemed hardly possible to doubt her. Even when \" young Mr. Malton\" declared he could produce numerous letters from her to support the fidelity of his statements, she re torted \u2014 and pretty truly \u2014 there was nothing in them that anybody might not have written to anybody, and that she did not care who saw them. Upon that young Malton vowed he would send them to Mr. Marrynett to know if he was of that opinion too ; and Charlotte was obliged to own to her sister and confidante, Phillippina, that that might not be quite the"], [81, "HYMENEALS. 73 thing, and that she would rather have them destroyed, if she could devise any possible plan, as there was no knowing what tricks such a needy fellow might be induced to play when he found she was going to marry so rich a man ! Perhaps bring a ridiculous action against her, that would annoy poor, dear, old Marrynett ! Phillippina was much looked up to by her elder sister as a diplomatist and a skilful manager in difficulties, and she agreed to bestir herself to obtain the destruction of those foolish but not altogether harmless documents. She managed it certainly very cleverly and diplomatically, according to the definition of this latter term by the experienced personage who declared it meant lying abroad for the good of your country. Phillippina ventured boldly, and for her sister's sake made a statement to the vicar's lady that only on condition of re storing these letters would Mr. Featherstone engage to bestow the reversion of his father's living on the youth, though he would not humi liate himself to arrange the condition person ally, or by word of mouth, making the good old lady believe, at the same time, as appear-"], [82, "74 HY'MENEALS. ances justified, that the Squire's own heart was set upon completing so advantageous an alliance for his eldest niece as the one which superseded young Malton's hopes. He must, after all, have been something of a mercenary sort of a fellow, this discarded lover, and scarcely deserved his good fortune to escape the wife he had sought. For his mother in duced him to comply upon the understood com pact that he was to obtain the benefice he pro bably counted among the advantages of the alliance. Mr. Featherstone's word was knoAvn to be as good as any bond, and the audacity of counterfeiting such an assurance entered not the victim's head. He must have been also a par ticularly vain person (he certainly was very good-looking in a large, fair, Chinese-faced way), for he only finally consented to giving up the papers on the condition that he might make the restitution with his own hands. Even at that eleventh hour the \" young prig,\" as Phillippina called him, possibly expected the sight of him Avould prove irresistibly restora tive, and outshine the glitter of a hundred thou sand pounds ! But Miss Clanbrassey felt her"], [83, "75 HYMENEALS own security and was willing to any conditions, and the interview took place. But then young Malton really behaved so foolishly, and cried so much, and went on so like a betrayed, love-sick girl imploring mercy of a hard-hearted seducer, that Charlotte was quite disgusted with her paltry lover, and flung the letters he brought at once into the fire \u2014 told him he was a big baby, and ought to be still in swaddling-clothes \u2014 turned her back upon him, and left him planteld without farther remorse. Rosanna Clanbrassey found the \" big baby \" sobbing, and was very sorry for him indeed, and tried very much to console him by telling him that her sister was one of the most terrible flirts in existence, and would be sure to make the husband she had \" booked \" miserable, and that if he would only read them, she could bring him lots of Latin books from her uncle's library, where it was pro\\'ed there was no such thing at all as happiness or misery, provided people took things as they ought. But it was the young man's first great female disappointment (the grand one is mostly a suc cess !), and he continued inconsolable, and talked"], [84, "76 HYMENEALS. of blowing out his brains, a long time after the wedding, to his mother. But he did not do it. Perhaps they were not so easily to be found ; still, the very name of Clanbrassey continued to young Malton's life's end so associated with treachery and heartlessness, that though, in a manner, he should have fallen naturally to Ro sanna's lot in after years, not all the kindness and encouragement that young lady, of the name, could extend, ever overcame the unjust and illogical prejudice. But when the affair of the letters was got over, all went forward well and smoothly with our lovers. Mr. Marrynett became more and more enchanted every visit with his beautiful betrothed, though he Avas rather shy and awk ward at first in his way of showing his satisfac tion. When this nervous feeling was overcome, his demonstrations of affection became, on the other hand, considerably outres, and even alarm ing, and annoyed Charlotte a great deal more than she ventured to let appear. For she early discovered that like all the parvenus, Mr. Mar rynett was terribly sensitive to the least indi cation of anybody's thinking less of him than"], [85, "77 HYMENEALS. he thought of himself, not imagining for a moment that his manners, sayings, or doings, partook at all of a plebeian past. In other respects, it must be allowed, he was rather dull and heavy company, and took a world of trouble to amuse, unless when he was eating or drinking. Philippina, however, played a good second to her sister in sustaining the monotony, varied by such unpleasant interludes, of the accepted suitor's society. She had become almost as anxious as Charlotte herself that the wealthy alliance should be secured. The sisters were obliged to persuade Mr. Marrynett that he desired the ceremony to be performed by an old friend of his in Liverpool, a Reverend Mr. Macnab, to account for its not being performed by the Featherstone clergyman. But Mr. Marrynett himself would even have liked the whole ceremonial to take place in that city, under the envying and admiring gaze of his wealthy allies and compeers of trade. Mr. Featherstone, however, could not be induced to stretch his complaisance so far, and allow him self to be thus openly dragged in triumph at the golden chariot wheels of the conqueror."], [86, "78 HYMENEALS. He consented to give away the bride ; but he expressed an emphatic desire to Charlotte \u2014 which that fortunate young lady thought proper to respect \u2014 that she would not invite her sister Rosanna to figure as one of her bridesmaids. Carte blanche was given for Philippina, and any young girls from Liverpool Mr. Marrynett might think proper, if he knew any young per sons willing to the office ! But he would not consent to the great assemblage of male friends from that city whom Mr. Marrynett Avished to form his cortege. No, though he most liberally offered to be at the whole expense of the enter tainment, leaving Mr. Featherstone all the credit of the display ! The latter gentleman, indeed, smiled quiver ingly, and grew rather queerly pale as he de clined the advantageous offer. But he contented himself with merely reminding Mr. Marrynett that the very recent death of his former wife rendered an absence of superfluous display a matter of taste. Nor was his opinion changed by the millionaire's simple assurance that every body in Liverpool knew he and his late wife had led a cat and dog life of it for years before she"], [87, "79 HYMENEALS. died, and that there was, consequently, not the least reason to try and humbug people by pre tending to respect her memory so much ! In short, Mr. Featherstone behaved himself with a completely marvellous patience and ac quiescence on all possible points, making only a confidante of his youngest niece, Rosanna, to whom he incessantly repeated the words : Let us only once get the wretches married. And Rosanna, who had been trained by Mr. Feather stone himself in all sorts of good sense and rationality, persuaded herself that she did not care the least about being a bridesmaid, and was as indignant as her uncle at the means that had brought the occasion for dispensing with her services about. But it cannot be denied that the sight of the splendid wedding trousseau, and the fine presents the bridegroom insisted (very properly) on making his bride, awakened divers feminine emotions in her breast that would have made her uncle more than ever despair of the efficacy of his systems of edu cation, applied to the female sex, to remove its natural weaknesses. People wondered, in fact, quite as much as at"], [88, "80 HYMENEALS. anything else, at Mr. Marrynett's sudden out bursts of profusion in the decoration of his new bride, and the preparations he made for her fit ting inauguration. Whereas it was well known he had almost grudged his defunct spouse \u2014 whose fortune had laid the foundation of his own, small as it might be in comparison \u2014 the necessaries of life, a prince could hardly have exhibited more liberality than he evinced in the treatment, actual and proposed, of the new young, and beautiful, and well-born bride. He made her the most valuable gifts, he signed the handsomest settlements, he proceeded to purchase and magnificently furnish the stateliest villa in the neighbourhood of Liverpool, that could be procured, for her future residence. It seemed as if this Bonaparte of trade thought it impossible to lavish his money sufficiently to express his sense of the honour done to him by his alliance into the county family. Lady Souchong, who was herself a woman of wealthy habits, stared at the accounts she re ceived. \" Goodness me ! does Marrynett think he is marrying an empress ? What, after all, is she ? An Irish lord's granddaughter ! Fine"], [89, "81 HYMENEALS. trumpery to make such a parade over, and, be sides, herself such a commonplace-looking per son, with great red country cheeks ; everybody but this poor infatuated man, who will have it she is a beauty, tells me she is !

Charlotte Clanbrassey made hay while the sun shone, heedless who liked or disliked ; and she managed easily to convince a man who was greatly enamoured \u2014 in a sensual, animal way, it is true, \u2014 of her charms, that whatever she wished to be done was the usual and proper thing to do, towards a lady in her position, under Mr. Marrynett's circumstances. It pleased him almost equally, indeed, to exhibit how much he could afford, as for her to exact the most. The marriage was celebrated at last, after vol. I. 6"], [90, "82 HYMENEALS. everything had been arranged to the bride's satisfaction, particularly in the article of the wedding tour. Philippina had contrived to get herself invited to accompany the newly-wedded pair, and sug gested that this should not be taken to any of the usual \" snob Liverpool places,\" as she called them \u2014 such as Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man, or even London. She proposed Paris, where she knew their stylish relations of the Clanbrassey family were likely to be at the time of the year, whose acquaintance she so much desired to make. And willing to oblige her helpful sister, Charlotte ordered her bridegroom to take a three months' holiday for the purpose from business and Liverpool. This demand was not so much to the mer chant's taste as the other arrangements. He slightly demurred. \" I never was absent three days together from the counting-house before,\" he remarked ; \" still it is perhaps as well to begin getting Souchong accustomed to run alone, as I shall have to be absent a good deal, of course, when I go into Parliament, as you seem to wish me, dearest, and seem to expect I shall"], [91, "83 HYMENEALS. cut such a shine in. And Souchong ought not to grumble, though it will keep his nose rather to the grindstone, and he goes in for being such a great man ever since he has received his ridi culous title, merely from the accident of being mayor the time a royal baby was born, and taking up our address ! He is only junior partner in the house, and must be made to understand his true position.\" And so upon this point also the enamoured millionaire yielded, and the rather that it gave him an opportunity to make a flourish of his new position to his partner, whose elevation in rank continued a secret but lasting heartburn in his senior's breast. \" You see, Souchong,\" he replied to the re monstrances of the junior, who, aware of his partner's superior knowledge and skill in busi ness, did not altogether relish the notion of so protracted a responsibility, \" you see, ladies that come of the peerage, and that sort of thing, don't expect to be treated in the way females of other denominations may.

Immediately the house was cleared of its un welcome company, Mr. Featherstone made the startling announcement to his remaining niece that he did not intend either of her sisters should return to his house.

Nor could all Mrs. Primmer's weeping expostulations and voavs of her perfect innocence in the whole late transactions, induce him to alter his resolution. Mr. Featherstone had indeed made up his mind on this point, on some effective hints furnished by the diplomatic Philippina, and nothing could alter it.

Still, this chapter cannot proceed altogether as unmarried readers will conclude likely from the harmonious heading. All human happi ness \u2014 even the happiness of the honeymoon \u2014 has its alloys, and so it was with that of the fond and wealthy Marrynetts ere theirs, too, had waned away into a common orb of night. All went satisfactorily enough indeed for awhile. Charlotte Clanbrassey took upon her perhaps rather exorbitantly at first, in her capa city of young wife to a good deal older husband, and lorded it o\\rer her bridegroom with a despot ism bordering on insolence and downright folly of assumption and sway. But her beauty and dashingly coquettish and cajoling ways carried off a good deal, and Mr. Marrynett was not indisposed to make allowances for arrogance and pretensions which he imagined the proper cha racteristics of birth and superiority of all sorts. It is true, he did not relish Paris much ; and after a very little experience, grew stunned and wearied in the midst of the glittering vortex of dissipation his wife's grand relations introduced them into. For Lord and Lady Clanbrassey were discovered in Paris by the indefatigable"], [99, "91 WEDDED BLISS. Philippina ; and having ascertained what a wealthy match their niece had made, took these newly-found relatives kindly under pro tection and chaperonage. His lordship even, in the most condescending spirit of equality, borrowed several hundred pounds of Mr. Mar rynett, with no other acknowledgment than his OAvn noble assurance that he would pay in the course of a few days, when some remittances he expected would come to hand. These were slow, however, in the journey. Indeed, his lordship seemed more inclined to extend than cancel the trifling obligation ; but with all his admiration of rank, Mr. Marrynett had a still greater respect for his money, and in the end showed signs that he would lend no more with out some security. But meanwhile the Irish peer's French countess was busied in securing the favour of her wealthily-wedded niece, and establishing an influence over her, by intro ducing her into the gayest society of her native metropolis, and initiating her into the dissipa tion and dissipated maxims of the scenes they frequented. A business for which her ladyship was extremely well qualified, having spent a"], [100, "92 WEDDED BLISS. widowed youth of intrigue and coquetry, which in other capitals would haATe removed her from respectable society altogether, before she fasci nated the admiration of Lord Clanbrassey. Not so much by her beauty and accomplishments of the kind indeed, as by her undoubted possession at the time of some pretty substantial means, the results \u2014 as she stated \u2014 of a successful Hom burg lottery ticket ; means, at all events, not below the attention of a beggared Irish peer, who had not then made himself a sufficient nuisance in Parliament to secure the govern ment place he now enjoyed. Mr. Marrynett grew not to like this associa tion altogether \u2014 not at all, in fact. Hitherto he had not been deemed of a jealous temperament \u2014 nor probably had his first homely and neglected spouse given him the least occa sion for the feeling. But a singularly uneasy and disquieting emotion, possibly of this kind, began to trouble the newly-made Benedict's re pose. He found himself what he concluded to be the extremely envied possessor of a beautiful and accomplished young lady bride, very con siderably his junior, whose vivacious boldness of"], [101, "93 WEDDED BLISS. demeanour was fully on a par with that of the headlong, glittering society in whose whirl she seemed to join as if to the manner born, but in whose movement he could only figure like a bull in a ballet. He did not himself under stand a word of French, and he saw his wife surrounded by a throng of clattering admirers, in whose conversation she appeared to take the greatest enjoyment, which they amply shared, and who spoke nothing else. Not that Char lotte Marrynett, nee Clanbrassey, spoke French very well herself, but she never hesitated at speaking it ; and if she made blunders every thing was excused to the intrepidity with which she plunged into them, and to the handsome wife of a millionaire Anglais. A millionaire Anglais still, though meriting the sobriquet he received of the Statue of the Commander ; an expression invented for him by Lady Clan brassey, whose finesse easily detected that, silent and motionless as the Marrynett husband as yet mingled in the proceedings, he was not unlikely to emerge in some inconvenient and alarming form in the business of the scene. Still, Mushroom Marrynett, conceiving that"], [102, "94 WEDDED BLISS. the bridegroom of a young lady of birth must show himself indulgent, bore all without much murmuring for a time. Even a discovery that the Countess Clanbrassey had introduced his wife at some great Russian princess's, whose house numbered among its attractions a roulette table, where she lost the hundred pounds he had given her as a start for pocket-money at a sitting, and wanted another \" to retrieve her ill luck.\" He allowed her to go to a bal masque at the opera-house, on an understanding that the Duke of Orleans and his highly respected duchess would also patronize it, and afterwards learned they never honoured such assemblies with their presence, without too much indigna tion. But there was a certain handsome, mili tary, splendidly-moustachio'd, hourglass-waisted Sardinian Count, who had a terrific reputation for duels and gallantry, who took upon himself to hang about in Mrs. Marrynett's train in a manner that very much surprised and annoyed the British husband, whose honeymoon was scarcely expired. Charlotte's explanation that it was quite the thing in Paris to be dangled aster by any man who happened to be in fashion"], [103, "95 WEDDED BLISS. in society at the time, did not satisfy him. Neither was he put in a better train of marital resignation by the information he received on another occasion, that if he went on so ridi culously Count St. Gothard \u2014 who never missed his man \u2014 might be provoked into challenging him. Mr. Marrynett answered savagely that if he did so he would thrash him within an inch of his life, by way of acceptance. And when his wife contemptuously observed no gentleman would ever have thought of such a low style of settling a difference, proper only for English prize-fighters, he very nearly struck herself by way of retort to the sarcasm. There was no thing Mr. Marrynett could endure less than anything that seemed to reflect upon his ante- cedents. To be sure, it cost him a most abject submission to make up the quarrel, and the money for a cashmere shawl which Lady Clan- brassey wanted to dispose of at a bargain, though it was a present, she asserted, from an Indian prince in London to herself, to secure her lord's interest with the ministry. But this submission was only temporary, for demagogue as he had once been proud to exhibit"], [104, "96 WEDDED BLISS. himself, Mushroom Marrynett was at heart a despot of the most exacting and self-attributing order. Indeed, if a poacher is mostly a game keeper turned inside out, so is a demagogue generally only a despot turned outside in. On several subsequent occasions, Mr. Marrynett grew to exhibit phases of character and manner that reminded his wife \u2014 and she was too high spirited and senseless to refrain from inform ing him so \u2014 of all he sprung from and had gone through until he had achieved the opportunity of making himself so completely disagreeable and contemptible in \" good society,\" as she assured him he was. He swore, she said, as brutally as the \" common sailor \" he had been \u2014 behaved among gentlemen in all other respects just in the way\" one would expect an \"upstart\" parish boy would that had made a fortune by \" slavedriving and kidnapping;\" and grudged one's little ne cessary expenses in a place like Paris, as miserly as if he still considered himself the husband of a \" transported marine-store dealer's wretched drunken drudge of a daughter,\" and keeping a huckster's shop in Goree Alley ! Charlotte had evidently not forgotten the"], [105, "97 WEDDED BLISS. points of her uncle's \"grand remonstrance;\" but it is likely she did not do herself much good by letting her husband know there was nothing in his past to be concealed or glossed over by the assumption of more refined and genteel appearances at present. Anger and resentment were kindled in his own violent and ungoverned nature by the new disappointment awaiting him in the discovery that, instead of enhancing his own greatness and consequence, his wife's supe rior social position furnished her with so galling an armoury of insult and abuse. On her part, she was exasperated to the highest degree to find she was expected only to have changed one tyranny (as she deemed her uncle's rule) for another, unmitigated by the milder and gentle manly externals of his sway. And, in short, things went on so very uncomfortably that the tendency was evidently to some great explosion. \u2014 Which came at last, though in what form exactly was never known save to the pair them selves, whatever Lady Clanbrassey might after wards assert, who went all over Paris the next day, making the salons peal with laughter over vol. i. 7"], [106, "98 WEDDED BLISS. the unhappy \" gaucherie anglaise,\" which had allowed a charming billet-doux from the Count St. Gothard to slip out of the pocket of that grande niaise of a peach-face Madame Marry nett, right under \" the lobster- claAV nose, to the big, courier boots, adorned with bunions like the bulbs of a tulip\" of that vieux brutal of a ci devant commis-voyageur of a husband, veritably Britannic ! There were only these two supports to my Lady Clanbrassey's version of the affair, that certainly the Count St. Gothard, making a morning call on Madame, was received by Monsieur, who, taking him by his elegant geranium-coloured necktie, turned him forcibly right about, and kicked him out of the hotel into the street. A portion of the affair which could not be dissembled, as the street happened to be so public and frequented a one as that which extends before the Hotel Meurice. And the violent tempered Charlotte herself was so thoroughly cowed, either by the punishment she witnessed, or from some other cause, that she submitted Avithout a single word of remonstrance to her husband's orders, instantly to pack up and"], [107, "WEDDED BLISS. 99 accompany him to the chemin de ser for Eng land, or remain by herself, for the remainder of her life, if she thought proper, in Paris. Her sister, Philippina, giving her version of the transaction, always declared that Charlotte had purposely, and of her own accord \u2014 indig nant at the man's impudence \u2014 handed the Count's letter over to her husband. And really it was just as likely as not, for Charlotte's vanity rendered her capable of anything that could illustrate the power of her charms, and her folly might suggest that the best way to keep her husband in obedience, was to alarm him at the consequences of exciting her anger with so finely -mustachioed an avenger at hand. Neither was she at all a likely kind of person to be led into any compromising imprudence that might forfeit the advantages of the wealthy alliance she had effected, by an impulse of passion, or rash sentiments of any kind. But she coquetted so furiously, the vanity of a lady-killer might well have misled the Sardinian into suppositions a great deal in advance of his true progress. However it befel, this proved Mr. Marrynett's first great victory over his wife's wilfulness and 7\u20142"], [108, "100 WEDDED BLISS. spirit of defiance and obstinacy in her own opinions, which she was destined to discover he by no means intended should be the last. The now thoroughly husband and wife re turned from their bridal tour fully a month before the time assigned originally for its enjoyment, and condemned exclusively to the delights of each other's society. For Philippina had used her opportunities so well in the Clan brassey society, that everybody believed she had made a conquest of the Russian princess's only son and heir, to amuse whom the roulette table was chiefly formed, at which he won a good deal of money, and spent it as liberally in grand entertainments to his friends, among whom he displayed a marked preference for the ladies. Under these circumstances, and Lord Clanbras sey having at the time just received a letter from Mr. Featherstone, reminding him that he also was an uncle, and requesting him to take charge of the introduction to society of a young lady so qualified to adorn it, but which his own isolation prevented him from attempting ; and also forwarding the first quarter of a moderate but sufficient yearly stipend to defray the un\u00bb"], [109, "101 WEDDED BLISS. avoidable expenses, Philippina was invited by her noble relations to remain with them on a visit in Paris, the Countess, in addition, smilingly intimating that if she should see no reason to desire to prolong her stay in that capital afterwards, she should have as much pleasure in introducing her young relation to London as she hoped she had exhibited in introducing her to Parisian society. Philippina was no fool, and she received these compliments in the spirit they were offered ; but she could not endure the thoughts of returning to the dreary and hopelessly un marriageable soli tude of Featherstone Haugh. She confided, besides, sufficiently in her own genius to believe she should be able to take the advantages while avoiding any very strong drawbacks that might exist in the proposed arrangement. And she crowned the results of her diplomacy by ob taining a loan for dress and incidental expenses, from Mr. Marrynett, even when at the height of his passion, cording his trunks. He was sti 1 apparently willing to promote projects of family aggrandizement, or was glad to make some sacrifice to be rid of his sister-in-law's aiding"], [110, "102 WEDDED BLISS. and abetting in his wife's follies and resistance to his authority. Lord Clanbrassey candidly confessed he had no immediate means at disposal for the purpose of repaying the trifle he had himself borrowed of his wealthy nephew-in-law ; but he certainly behaved rather handsomely in offering to meet the Count St. Gothard with pistols or sword, on that nephew-in-law's behalf, when the former, maddened at the indignity he had received, pro claimed him a coAvardly fugitive, and no gentle man, all over Paris. But the Count would be satisfied with nothing but the original offender, ana breathing fire and vengeance, followed up the traces of his departed antagonist even into Liverpool itself, where dispatching a challenge with slaughter and death in every line, he had his wrongs culminated by being arrested and held to bail to keep the peace towards all Her Majesty's subjects of the perfide Albion for a year after and a day. And he was killed in another affair long before that. Arrived and installed in Liverpool, Charlotte Marrynett speedily recovered from the dejection left by this unkind exertion of a husband's"], [111, "103 WEDDED BLISS. authority, in abridging her pleasant stay in Paris, and was seized with new pi ejects of pleasure and triumph, that took as strong hold of her frivolous mind as the dangerous delights she had been compelled to leave. She conceived the notion of raising herself to be a sort of queen in the provincial city her fate was cast upon, and to outdazzle rivalry by displays of the mag nificence and luxury her husband's wealth, she considered, fully entitled her to exhibit. Had there been no other motive, there was the highest female one, in connection with the impertinent pretensions of her husband's part ner's wife, Lady Souchong, who, on the strength of that title, and her descent from a great mer cantile family there, took upon herself the leader ship of ton in the society of Liverpool. Mrs. Marrynett, nee Clanbrassey, had, of course, a just patrician contempt for both these claims to distinction, and determined to vindicate her own real and inherited claims to the superiority. And in this she was heartily backed by her husband, desirous of any species of consolation, and seeing it chiefly in the fact that whatever else she had shown herself, his wife was the"], [112, "104 WEDDED BLISS. granddaughter of a peer, and aristocratically connected in every other way. The spirit of emulation and parvenu pride of the millionnaire parish-boy could easily, besides, be directed in this new channel, and Mushroom Marrynett showed that he did not grudge money when it was required in so just and necessary a cause as to eclipse the pseudo honours of the be-knighted Souchongs. On her part, Lady Souchong AA7as a woman of spirit, and quite as determined not to yield a step to the pretendedly aristocratic claims of \"a rubbishing Irish peerage in a family, or the re lationship of an old, stuck-up, poverty-stricken country guy like Mr. Featherstone, of the Haugh ;\" who, besides, would have nothing to say or do with his new relations. For this was now a well-ascertained fact, and gave much satisfaction in the Souchong family.

For either in mockery or emulation of the fine quarterings now displayed with the blanks of Mr. Marrynett's arms on his carriages, the Souchongs caused themselves to be granted a splendid yellow coat-of-arms, or, with a tea plant proper, surmounted by a wreath borne by two Chinese figures in the most gorgeous of Chinese costumes, with pigtails and three swords apiece, and the punning loyal motto over all : \u2014 \" Semper servo Te /\" Still, in spite of the full reconciliation which had apparently taken place between the Marry nett spouses, and their harmony in the pursuit of this grand common object, Mrs. Marrynett continued painfully aware of a liability to sudden"], [114, "106 WEDDED BLISS. but decisive obstructions to her supremacy on her husband's part, that alarmed her with fears for the prolonged tenure of her power.

It almost seemed as if he had made up his mind to ignore as much as possible the relationship in order to banish its associations from the minds of others. And so little Betsy Marrynett grew up in a singular species of orphanage, which seemed to date on both sides of her parentage from even long before her mother's death. Strange fact as it may appear, it was a fact that she scarcely knew herself to have a father during all the years of her infancy, and she regarded Mr. Marrynett no less than his new bride as awful strangers, into whose presence she was for some unknown but terrible reason dragged, Avhen the pair returned home from their stormy wedding tour. And even this was a good deal more her nurse's fancy than the wishes of either Mr. Marrynett or his bride, who were both in a very sulky, inauspicious humour for any kind of ten der demonstration, let alone to a child which, it seemed, presented few claims on partial recogni tion. \" What a stuck-up little nose, and a wide mouth ! quite a little ogress, I declare !

And yet as long as this child re mained her husband's only one, the new wife was haunted by a vague but deep sentiment of jea lousy and rivalry of the dead mother, who had left an enduring memento, or, as it were, pro-"], [119, "WERE FORTUNES. 111 test, behind her, in her surviving fruit.

Had she been an empress, and expected to preserve instead of founding a dynasty, no event could have been more anxiously expected than Mrs. Marrynett's first confinement; no cares more devotedly lavished than on her during the period of expectation.

Far from projecting the alliance in question, it was notorious that Adelaide's beauty had from her earliest years so awakened Mrs. Marry nett's ambitious hopes, that she predicted con stantly and everywhere she would make one of the greatest matches of the time, if her papa would only take a house in London, and put them in the way of a consummation so de sirable. By a great match, Mrs. Marrynett always superciliously explained, she meant rank and riches together \u2014 not mere money, or any thing paltry in the way of a baronetcy or knight age, but \u2014 a peerage of the realm. Perhaps she was only provoked into a decla ration of these pretended views on the heir of the Souchongs by a spirit of contradiction to her husband, or else she was really alarmed as well as exasperated to find the extent to which Mr. Marrynett was prepared to carry his new born favour to his first wife's child, and the"], [134, "126 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. utter defiance of her tastes and opinions plainly implied in the choice he had made of a son-in law. In fact, Mr. Marrynett had in no Avay con sulted his consort on the subject, and she was not at all aware Avith Avhat ulterior views he had insisted on sending Elizabeth Marrynett to a most expensive finishing-school a short time previous to the conversation detailed. Yet she had been sufficiently vexed and annoyed at the proceeding in itself, and made it the constant subject of tantalizing remark and sneer. \" Adelaide, keep yourself bolt upright, dear ! your papa's daughter will soon be home from a London drill-master, Avith her shoulders beauti fully down, and will make fun of you then.

The principal subject of the discussion had, hoAvever, been made but too painfully aware of her father's intentions on her behalf.

Mrs. Mar rynett, after a long resistance, had broken him into dressing himself in full \" tog\" for dinner daily on his return from business, by the simple process of refusing to sit down at the table with him if he did not.

And as she had a great dread of her father, from scarcely ever experiencing any notice but such as conveyed distaste and rebuke from him, no doubt presented herself awkwardly enough. And it must be admitted besides that the young woman was of a rather awkward figure in her self. She had grown beyond her strength, and was tall and somewhat stooping in the shoulders ; nor was she very handsome in the face, in consequence of the irregularity of her features, softened though they were by her very fair though almost colourless complexion, ex cepting Avhen it kindled into life under the action of a most sensitive and quivering nervous organization.

Mr. Marrynett was reading a share-list, lounging on a sofa, with one big-bunioned dress boot crossed uneasily and swinging over a knee, waiting the summons to dinner, and evidently thinking a brief interval sufficient for the im portant business he had on hand. He never even looked up as the young girl entered, remaining with the door in her hand, as if anxious to make her evasion as speedily as possible, and seeming by her wavering com plexion very much alarmed. Only he said, in a stern, concise tone, \" Shut that door ! I don't want the servants to hear what I am saying \u2014 I am not so fond of making confidants of ser vants, as they tell me you are, Miss Marrynett !\""], [139, "131 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. Miss Marrynett closed the door, but Avith such nervous alarm and precipitation, that she let it go with a bang, which made her father start up in wrath from his reclining attitude. \"What a d \u2014 d noise you do make, Betsy!\" he exclaimed. \" You must be quite the awkward, stupid creature every one tells me you are.

Report credited him with a most avaricious and exacting disposition, so that his own father hardly relished the idea of letting his clutch into the firm. \" Toby will be the master of us all very soon, or throw every thing into confusion ! \" he observed, even to the young gentleman's own mother, who took his part in everything ; she did not know why, except that he was her eldest son, and in that quality led her any way he thought proper. In other respects, Mr. Tobias Souchong was considered very far from an amiable young gen tleman, in the bosom of his own family. His younger brothers, who were jolly and hearty fel lows like their father, were afraid of him, and"], [153, "145 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. had their suspicions he would some day unhand somely foist them both. He kept them on very short allowance already by his influence with their father. \" It is only teaching the young beggars to be idle and extravagant ! \" he would preach against every expansion of the pa rental benevolence. And to crown all, Mr. Tobias Souchong was endowed with a bitterly sarcastic turn of mind and expression, Avhich enabled him to gratify his inborn cross-grained and malignant temperament, in a manner that gained him almost universal dislike. Great pre tensions to religion and sectarian leadership ren dered these defects of character still more strik ingly obvious \u2014 due, however, in part perhaps, to an extremely bad digestion and a restless irrita bility of the nerves, which rendered the inflicter perhaps almost as uncomfortable as most people called upon to endure the misery of his society. And now, from her very earliest childhood, Elizabeth Marrynett knew that she had always considered this peevish manikin a most disagree able fellow. His fine clothes and finical ways annoyed her, and made her the more conscious of a painful lack of feminine attributes of the kind, vol i. 10"], [154, "146 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. which had always contributed to her awkward ness in grand society. He had almost all along behaved to her, as a girl, with insolence and as sumption of superiority and disdain. He made fun of what he called \" Bet Marrynett's turn-up nose \" \u2014 her \" carrot hands,\" and her \" yellow tow, mermaid hair.\" He jeered so much, in fact, when a lad, at her long and certainly very fair hair that Mrs. Marrynett herself deigned at last to notice the circumstance that it was like a \" little savage's,\" and, in spite of the poor child's cries and entreaties, ordered it to be cut off quite close to her head. Upon which the malicious boy changed the form of persecution into declaring she looked like a charity-girl, and ought to be set up by the organ on Sundays to screech psalms ! Elizabeth Marrynett had always been re markable for a quiet, unpretending demeanour. If ever an English girl's motion \" blushed at itself,\" hers did ; but she was acutely sensitive to ridicule, and susceptible almost to agony of any kind of designed attack on her feelings, and very limited notions of the personal respect due to her. Indeed, she had been all her life so"], [155, "147 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. snubbed and cast into the back-ground that she scarcely fancied she had any claims at all on society, in a personal sense. Only she did find it rather hard she should be drawn from the modest shade of her obscurity to be made the butt and merriment of a company, at the pleasure of an ill-natured, viper-tongued, little personage, whose notice, for her own part, she laboured most to shun. These were the causes \u2014 and not the lowness of taste her step-mother often disdainfully ascribed to her parentage on the mother's side \u2014 that made Elizabeth Marrynett so greatly pre fer the lower to the upper regions of her father's house, as long as she was permitted to do so. She had kind friends in the housekeeper's room, and even in the kitchen, and she had none in the draw ing room or boudoir. In particular, the house keeper at \" Liverpool Palace \" was a careful and loving protectress to the desolate girl. Early in his second matrimony, Mr. Marry nett discovered he could not manage his house hold without the help of some such intermediate official. Not only was the new mistress of tlie establishment entirely unacquainted with the 10\u20142"], [156, "148 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. details of housekeeping \u2014 she disdained such drudgery, and plainly evinced her determination not to be upper servant in any man's domesticity, no matter whether a husband or not. And she carried out the principle in so determined and utterly neglectful a manner that, in conjunction with the crowds of company she speedily col lected around him, Mr. Marrynett found it abso lutely necessary to hire the surveillance he could not bestow himself, nor induce his vain and showy wife. Infinitely to the scorn and animad version of Lady Souchong, who, although a knight's lady, delighted in nothing so much as housekeeping. Luckily \u2014 for Mr. Marrynett at least \u2014 just at this period a ship belonging to his firm foundered at sea, and the captain and nearly all the crew were lost. This unfortunate captain left a widow and an only child, with scarcely any other inheritance than his good name, and the balance of a most moderate salary, reckoned to the very day \u2014 almost hour \u2014 he was drowned. But Mr. Marrynett was excessively thrifty in some things, and controlled the more generous impulses of his partner; and, adopting poor Richard's"], [157, "149 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. counsels, was always just before he was generous \u2014 and then felt no obligation to be so. The widow was, therefore, obliged to turn her atten tion to some means of earning her own and her boy's living ; and being very well qualified for management, as having presided during several voyages over an East Indiaman, as captain's lady, advertised for a situation of the kind described above. Mr. Marrynett happened at the moment to have made it out clearly to himself he could not possibly do Avithout a housekeeper, and although he was rather annoyed at first to find who was the applicant, from a dim consciousness that she had some claims upon a better provision at his hands, he consented to receive Mrs. Mary Segrave in that capacity at \" Liverpool Palace.\" The poor woman was, however, obliged to part with her little boy, whom neither Mr. nor Mrs. Marrynett would fora moment hear of her retaining near her, and was forced to content herself that she was thus enabled to afford him some rudiments of scholarship and education. But it could not of course be refused to the widow to see her only child occasionally, and as"], [158, "150 THE ELDEST MISS MARRYNETT. the neglected Elizabeth Marrynett speedily grew into constant companionship with the kind and motherly housekeeper, the two children saw a good deal of each other in their early years, and eating their jam and bread and butter, and playing at cockshuttle together, contracted a most friendly intimacy and liking."], [159, "CHAPTER VIII. THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. Ringold Segrave was scarcely a year older than Elizabeth ; but being a boy of a fine healthy organization, overflowing with animal spirits and gaiety, he naturally took the lead and ascendancy of his own sex over the gentle and snubbed little girl, his playfellow, eldest born as she was of his mother's master and employer. But there were no signs by which children of all ages re cognise superiority of position in others, to be discerned in Elizabeth Marrynett. She was ill-dressed ; her manners were meek and retired ; and for a long time her education was so neg lected that she seemed in no degree raised in language or ideas above the level of the kitchen company in which she had spent her childhood."], [160, "152 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. That to which she now became habituated in the housekeeper's room was, in fact, a very much higher grade than any she had ever yet mingled in familiarly. Mrs. Segrave was a gentlewoman by birth, and though a little roughened by the sea life she had led during a portion of it, had seen something of the world and humanity under the strong condensers of the decks of a long voyage passenger-ship, and was thus qualified to become in many useful respects a guide and instructress to the tho roughly motherless girl. Ringold Segrave himself was a A'ery handsome lad, in a robust and masculine style of good looks \u2014 was of an open, generous nature, full to overflowing with the milk of human kind ness ; and largely inherited a seafaring distaste for all manner of fine outside show, and pre tences of all sorts. He relished his shy play fellow therefore all the better, it is likely, for not being what he called a \" stuck up young lady,\" and took to her with a singular warmth and heartiness of liking from the very first ; certainly long before he had worldly sense enough to take it at all into consideration that it"], [161, "153 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. might be very possible to advance his own inte rests by gaining the affection and confidence of the eldest daughter of the great Mr. Marry nett. It is true that he was a lad of very good understanding, and could not but be aware that Mr. Marrynett's eldest daughter had even pecu liar claims on the wealthy merchant's considera tion, in assigning their portions to his numerous female progeny. But when at last this latter notion might in some sort be said to dawn on his perception, Ringold Segrave had abundant reasons to satisfy his own conscience, and a high sentiment of honour that pervaded his whole honest nature, that any influence he acquired would be certain to remain of a disinterested order. The persevering neglect with which Elizabeth Marrynett was treated in her family, the ascendancy of a stepmother who so clearly disliked and ignored her, and the members of the new family to be provided for, all completely, in his eyes, supported his mother's theory of the situation that Mrs. Marrynett was leaving no stone unturned to get her husband's eldest born excluded as much as possible from the"], [162, "154 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. benefits of that position : nay, from any fair share in the destination of the general Marry nett inheritance, when the time should come for its distribution. If from nothing else, to judge from the passionate zeal and argument with which Mrs. Marrynett had hitherto ineffectually urged upon her husband the propriety of making his will. \" If things are meant fair, they would go all right of their own accord, without any will making,\" Mrs. Segrave would reasonably infer, endeavouring, though in vain, to rouse Elizabeth to some attention after her own interests in the case, and observation of her stepmother's ma n\u0153uvres. \" Let her have all she can get,\" Elizabeth would say, \" money cannot make people happy, or she would not want more than my father has already given her for her own use \u2014 if he should die, you tell me, \u2014 so why should I try after it?\" Perhaps the poor girl had already learned to consider her father's wealth on her Avay to hap piness ! But, on the other hand, I am of opinion that Mrs. Segrave, like any other mortal"], [163, "155 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. mother, had conceived private hopes of her own, of the future advancement of her son through the pretty plainly growing partiality of the eldest daughter of the wealthy Mr. Marrynett. That is to say, if the designs of her stepmother could be foiled in any reasonable degree ; for, observ ing with a mother's eye what a fine, clever young fellow her boy was, she cherished a fond belief that obstacles would be sure in the end to vanish, and that even the haughty merchant might be brought to see the true interests of his child in a match of the kind. It was quite clear that Elizabeth was no beauty ; she was no object of favour, or almost of notice, with her father ; there was even a taint on her genealogy which sometimes made Mrs. SegraA'e herself debate whether it would be to the credit of her own highly-respectable descent to connect into. But yet, on the whole, if common justice was done to the young girl, it could not be doubted she would prove a most eligible wife for a fortune less young man. Very possibly it was some floating maternal vision of the kind, which induced Mrs. Segrave to devote her influence with her son to inducing"], [164, "156 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. him to enter on a mercantile career. He did not relish it at all himself. He hated the confine ment, the subjection, the dry calculating and chicanery of business, to which he saw his school fellows in succession devoting themselves, from the commercial academy where his mother had purposely caused him to be reared. But he was exceedingly fond of her, and anxious to oblige her, and had grown, insensibly perhaps, to dis like the idea of going where he could not often see his playfellow of childhood, whose gentle and noble qualities of heart and mind he daily learned to appreciate at a dearer rate. A fine sentiment of compassion and resent ment against injustice in a kind and generous nature, had probably a good deal to do Avith Ringold Segrave's first earnest impressions of liking and attachment towards Elizabeth Marry nett. Almost the very first time he saw her, and never afterwards forgot, the contrast of the treatment to which she was subjected, to what was her fair due, in her father's house, struck him painfully, and roused that feeling of indig nant taking-part. He was paying a half-holiday visit to his mother, and sitting Avith her and"], [165, "157 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. Elizabeth at tea, wondering who the shy, pale, ugly little girl \u2014 so he thought her then \u2014 who blushed if the stranger boy but glanced at her, and whose voice trembled even to utter the monosyllables which were all she seemed to find at her command, could be. And he was thinking how very badly she was dressed \u2014 boy of eleven in too short corduroys as he himself was \u2014 when the door opened, and a magnificent little princess entered, who seemed to him at first like a figure out of a playhouse fairy-land. It was shining all over in silks and sashes ; had its beautiful black hair evidently curled artificially almost down to its silver morocco little boots ; had its showy little parasol ; and being of a most lovely, wax-doll complexion, wiih large, long- lashed, bright opal eyes, and disdainful little bow-of-cupid pouting lips, offered alto gether a dazzling vision of splendour and deco ration. This little princess presented herself with evidently a trained elegance of movement and tone, to deliver some command to the housekeeper from Mrs. Marrynett, and only deigned to notice the humbler pair at table Avith quite a supercilious sidelong glance of"], [166, "158 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. disdainful unacquaintance. Yet when she had stepped, at a dancing-master's glide, out of the apartment, Ringold vvas significantly informed by his mother, that it was \" Miss Adelaide, Betsy's sister, but not by the same lady, \u2014 con sidered a regular beauty, and brought up to the notion in such airs and graces, it was enough to make any rational creature stare to see how it could take to them so young !\" Assuredly, under these circumstances, there could not have been much of the interested order of attachment in the early affection of Ringold Segrave for Elizabeth Marrynett, and of which he himself was for a long while as unconscious as anybody else. He even knew all along that she could not by any means be considered a pretty girl. But that only height ened the marvel and interest of finding that with her sensitive smile and kind eyes, and soft, loving voice, he grew to be persuaded there must be something very beautiful about her, which if not in her face, was in her expression. I know for certain that for years he fancied her grandfather's delinquency had in some unknown way or other forfeited Elizabeth Marrynett her"], [167, "159 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. rights to a position in the world, as her wealthy father's eldest daughter. And when he came, in the progress of ripening understanding, and acquaintance with actualities, to dismiss this notion, another still more formidable arose in its place, and he became aware that Elizabeth Marrynett was so entirely dependent on her haughty and rapacious sire, that a poor suitor could have no possible chance for her hand with his consent. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the grand argument which prevailed with Ringold Segrave to submit to his mother's earnest wishes for him to enter on a mercantile career in Liverpool, was the notion that he should thereby remain nearer the playmate of his childhood. His own predilections, as has been said, were to his father's seafaring life ; which was, on the contrary, a subject of constant dread and aversion to his mother. She could never forget that dark night of tempest and horror in the Indian Ocean, in which the beloved, tender, and faithful hus band of her own youth sank for ever from her sight beneath the briny weight of waters."], [168, "160 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. Ringold even went, much against her wishes, on a single voyage, \" to try how he liked it,\" to South America, where his only object and busi ness seemed to have been to procure \" Bessy Marrynett,\" as he always called her, one of the most beautiful white macaws with a scarlet tuft ever seen. The devoted attention of the cabin boy to this bird on the home voyage, made the fun of the crew, and particularly his teaching it to keep constantly repeating the words : \" Bessy, dear, Bessy dear !\" The sailors Avould have it, that Ringold Segrave was in love with a girl of the name, who haunted the quays, and who was anything but a proper object of attachment to a lad of fifteen. But Ringold quietly endured all the fun and all the jeers, and the moment he could obtain leave from his vessel wrapped the precious cage in two of his best silk handker chiefs (his mother always rated him as a gentle man's son), and set off at a nimble step to see her, the housekeeper at \" Liverpool Palace.\" How bashfully, nevertheless, was this token of remembrance and goodAvill from South America presented to the real \" Bessy dear !\" with Avhat hesitating speech and kindling brows ! and how"], [169, "THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. 161 it was petted ; how welcome it was made by the young person to Avhom it was presented, whom Ringold Segrave had learned on his long twelve months' voyage, to call \" Miss Elizabeth !\" With what a deep blush of pleasure (Elizabeth was turned fourteen then), what a grateful, happy smile it was received. A smile that lighted up the whole commonplace (to the commonplace chiefly, perhaps,) features into a positive effulgence of something more beautiful than beauty, growing out from the loving, lovely soul within. ButAvhen the macaw began to let the company understand his powers of speech, and came out with his \" Bessy dear, Bessy dear !\" how white-hot pale the fair complexion became, and what a rare music to the desolate young heart seemed to dwell in those screeching bird-notes. Never was macaw's skill in articulate sounds more attentively stimulated and rewarded with lumps of sugar and ticklings under the feathers of the neck; and the only further fatigue he was ever after put to in acquiring expression, were the words \" Kind Ringold ! thank you, Ringold ; kind Ringold !\" After this long absence and return, the lad VOL.

He agreed to stay on shore, provided he could get anything to do. And the good woman ap plied herself with such diligence to procure him a situation the way she wished, that she actually ventured to speak to Mr. Marrynett on her son's behalf, though his sternness and sharp austerity of manner usually kept his dependents at a distance few of them felt tempted to pass over. But the day she did so it happened that Mr. Marrynett was in a particularly good hu mour over a successful speculation, which had enabled him for a while to forget how many daughters he had. Under whose influence he \" most kindly,\" as the widow said, declared he'd try if Carkman couldn't find room for him (the boy) at a desk in their own office, as he was always keeping up such a d \u2014 d croak that he hadn't quill-drivers enough, now the business Avas growing so !\" The unlucky macaw, however, nearly put this success in jeopardy. For Mrs. Marrynett,"], [171, "THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. 163 almost the first time she by chance heard its screech from the depth of the servants' depart ment, was very much surprised and irritated at the liberty taken by any menial to introduce a feathered inmate of the kind into the house.

Mrs. Segrave was accordingly summoned to the presence, and ex amined with the utmost severity as to her motives and intentions in bringing that horrid yelling creature into the house, when she knew there was nothing her mistress more detested than to have her nerves torn and racked by noises like that, so that she was obliged to keep even her own children quite at a distance, fas tened up in their nursery at the top of the house.

She was sure that even the child-beauty of the Marrynett family, Adelaide's, admiration of its fine plumage, would not have saved it from banishment on that ac count merely.

Neither were they for a long time vexed with the opposing friction that elicits the secret flame of hearts in flash and vehement outbreak. They met almost as often as they liked, in the house keeper's quarters ; or at least as often as the young man could contrive a fair reason to pay his mother a visit, Elizabeth being allowed there as much as she thought proper ; she very sel dom, indeed, being called upon to figure in the gay company that crowded her stepmother's magnificent reception-rooms. \" Such an awkward, long, gawky creature as she is, Marrynett,\" that lady would plead for her ; \" why do you want her to be exposing us all in the way she can't help, by forcing her into society?

Meanwhile, affairs had gone on pleasantly enough with the young people, possibly not unreported to the stepmother in certain stages of their slow progress to maturity. They did each other a world of good as they Avent on. Ringold controlled his naturally erratic tempera ment \u2014 the impulses of his free and lively character \u2014 to labour on in the stifling atmos phere of a merchant's counting-house, towards the object of his ambition, and was preserved from some of the worst errors of youth by the purity and warmth of his attachment for the virtuous and loving girl of his choice. At the same time, indignant at what he conceived to be the designed keeping back of Elizabeth Mar rynett from the advantages of education, he applied himself to the task of supplying de ficiencies, and bestowing upon her, at all events, the essentials and groundwork of cultivated in telligence.

But the thun-"], [180, "172 THE LONG ENGAGEMENT. der broke on a sudden in the midst of this serene sky, and produced a new era in the loves of the youthful pair, who had hitherto so quietly fed upon each other's silently-assured affection and plight. Elizabeth herself doubtless felt that a crisis had arrived in her own and her lover's destiny, which demanded full explanations and decision. I believe she had for some time now felt a sort of craving and necessity to know for a surety she was beloved. At all eA'ents, she took no pains to conceal her emotion on leaving her father's presence, and hastening to the house keeper's room, where she had left Mrs. Segrave not a little puzzled over the unusual summons, as well as the artful rejoining of the outsides of an old blanket to form a new middle \u2014 or as good as new. Nor did Elizabeth make any secret of the substance of her father's strange, and, to her, appalling announcement of his in tention of bestowing her in marriage.

Thus the event of Mrs. Marrynett's new incu bation was looked forward to with great interest in the most opposed quarters, in other respects. Only the Souchongs continued insultingly safe and jeering ; and Tobias, triumphant in his own prospects, even playfully suggested to her that as he was about to remove an Elizabeth from the family, she might call her own next daughter by that particularly English and national name. He noticed, he said, that she was in general very fond of fine female designations for her children, but the youngest, being in general a sort of pet, might have a name easily shortened into something familiar and homelike. Now, Elizabeth could be Bet'ed and Betsy 'd and 12\u20142"], [188, "180 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. Bessy 'd, no end to it ; and as there Avould be a vacancy in the establishment when he transferred her charming stepdaughter of the name to the one he was about to set up for himself, there could be no objection. Mrs. Marrynett thanked him for the sugges tion, and drily observed that, at all events, she should not think of calling her next daughter Australasia or Transportina, or anything long of that sort ; Mr. Souchong might, however, like to call his own first female-born by the name, after her great-grandfather, and she offered him the suggestion as liberally as he had offered his own. Tobias Souchong himself was \" shut up '' for that occasion ! All things worked thus to increase the pas sionate desire of Mrs. Marrynett for a male off spring to a species of ravening longing akin to insanity, in conjunction with the physical dis turbances of her situation. The bad-hearted Tobias even took care to let her know that the result was a matter of curious and facetious expectation in general Liverpool society. And what creature of Celtic organization can endure ridicule with any sobriety and patience ? The"], [189, "181 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. \" world's dread laugh \" seemed for the seventh time already to resound in Mrs. Marrynett's ears, and tortured her fancy incessantly in the forward expectation. All this accounted for the explosion of excited feeling she had uttered on the occasion of Mr. Marrynett divulging to her, for the first time, his intentions in favour of his eldest daughter, and her settlement in life. Had it still been the fashion for ladies to travel barefoot to the shrines of the saints, to implore the blessing so much desired, I am of opinion Mrs. Marrynett would not have cared for any number of cobble-stones to be passed over un shod \u2014 or even worse yet, in tight shoe-leather \u2014 to obtain this immense and long-denied boon of a son and heir. As the time grew on, her fretfulness and anxiety increased in a most extraordinary degree, until she became the tor ment of her husband and of her whole house hold, by the strange variations of her moods and caprices of fear and hope. Even Mrs. Primmer 's patience was at times exhausted, who of latter years had degenerated into the most obsequious of toadies and dependents, rather than take her chance again as a superannuated"], [190, "182 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. governess who had outlived the fashions of teaching of her time. But the poor woman had also her private troubles, her only son, a medical man, having turned out something very terrible indeed in misconduct, professional and otherwise ; and eloping with another woman, had left a young wife and family almost com pletely on her hands for a beggarly pittance of maintenance. Mrs. Marrynett contrived, however, by dis plays of her fantastically malicious theory, to induce Mr. Marrynett to keep Elizabeth at a distance at her \" finishing-school,\" and thus defer one of her most dreaded countermoves on the chessboard. And as she had managed to infect her husband with her own superstition of hope once more, it was in vain that the Souchongs were surprised, and murmured at the announced determination that the nuptials of their son with his promised bride were not to take place till after Mrs. Marrynett's restoration to health. But Tobias could not find so much fault as Avould have suited his carping talent in the case, since the project of giving Elizabeth a year's polish in education was entirely his own. And"], [191, "183 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. he had started the notion on very different real reasons than those he alleged ; hoping in that time to get quietly rid of an unfortunate young milliner whom he had seduced under promise of mar riage, and the hopes of a brilliant rise in the world by an honourable alliance with the indi vidual who had constituted himself her \" pro tector \" of the sort. Mrs. Marrynett's exactions and phantasies of various sorts grew at last so troublesome that every one at \" Liverpool Palace \" was glad when it was suddenly announced that she knew she should die if she did not set out at once to Leamington, where she heard there was a doctor who would exactly understand her case. A very clever man of his profession he must have been, if he did ! However, as Mrs. Primmer justly observed to her confidential employer's husband, he could at least prescribe, and soothe the poor lady's mind by assurances ; or as for her part she did not know Avhat would come of it \u2014 she really thought Mrs. Marrynett was going crazy ! That one idea seemed to have gained the com plete ascendency in her mind, and to haunt her very like a madness already ! The man at"], [192, "184 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. Leamington was a new beginner, and would not grudge time and trouble, and what mattered a little money compared with the great object in view of preserving the life and reason of the mother of a family of so many daughters ? Very possibly even the long-wished-for result might be hazarded by any injudicious crossing of her dear lady's wishes ! But Mr. Marrynett, who was tired and frightened himself at the exhibitions of his wife's perturbed state of mind, never dreamed of offering any opposition. And thenceforth spent about half of his time, racing backward and forward on the North Muddle- land Railway, between Liverpool and Leaming- ton, and Leamington and Liverpool, until the station-masters knew him quite as well as the guards of the trains, and a good deal better than the regular inspectors of the line, whose duty it was to see that all the company's rules were properly unattended to. In fact, Mr. Marrynett, under the influence of his revived hopes, became again the complaisant, all-submissive husband of fifteen years previously, ere his first Clanbrassey girl was born. However, Mrs. Marrynett acted with some"], [193, "185 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. impartiality on this occasion, for she would not suffer herself to be harassed by having any of her own children with her, though there were three of the little girls at home \u2014 one of them, the little deformity, being constantly in the doctors' hands to straighten her unfortunate little crooked back. Mrs. Segrave, who was not usually a favourite for important trusts Avith Mrs. Marrynett, was left in sole charge of these children. And little Eugenie, one of them, Avho really was a clever and observant young creature, did not fail to notice that her guardian house keeper was constantly receiving letters from London which she handed over without open ing to her son, and directing letters for him to London, which he brought to her ready sealed. As the time drew on for the expected ac couchement, it was believed that Mrs. Marry nett would return to her own house in Liverpool to receive the attentions her anxious situation required. But it was found she derived so much benefit from the Leamington air \u2014 she did not taste the waters \u2014 and a sedative course under which her new medical attendant placed .her, that Mrs. Primmer strongly advised Mr."], [194, "186 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. Marrynett not to think of removing her. He assented, and even in the excess of his ex pectant enthusiasm, declared an intention of taking up his abode for a time altogether with his wife in Leamington. But this proposal threw her into a renewed nervous agitation, and she made no scruple to tell Mr. Marrynett that she believed if he altered anything in their way of going on, it would be to her advantage, in point of health and tranquillity, if he would stay away altogether at his business in Liver pool. It was not only there, however, that tidings of the event in progress were looked forward to with, at all events, speculative curiosity and interest. Even Mr. Featherstone of the Haugh and his resident niece, Miss Rosanna Clan brassey, took some special interest in the mat ter. The latter, a good deal more, perhaps, than she conceived it advisable to trouble her uncle to understand. The Marrynetts con tinued anything but favourites with him, and it is certain he was very far from sympathizing with his nephew-in-law's unvaried disappoint ments in the sex of his children.

In reality, people's tempers and prejudices are seldom found to improve like wines by keeping,"], [196, "188 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. unless increased sharpness and acidity may be considered as such by moral connoisseurs also. Yet Mr. Featherstone had so much occasion to congratulate himself on the full success of his own theories of management, achieved with his remaining niece, as to be entitled to preserve the recollection of his principal failure in the utmost grief and bitterness \u2014 no doubt. Rosanna Clanbrassey had now safely reached the age of thirty-two without ever having been molested by a single offer, or approach to an offer, of marriage. All her nieces, doAvn to the youngest one, who could scarcely express her convictions articulately, looked upon her as a confirmed old maid. She could read Latin, had a slight idea of Greek, and was perfectly familiar with all the best English classics, histo rical and otherwise ; the poets also, on the sly, whom her uncle did not care that she should peruse. She could detect Hallam in an error of date, and Macaulay in a piece of false colour ing of a fact. She read the leading article of the Times with relish ; gravely cut open the leaves of the Quarterly ; tried to persuade her self that the Saturday was very funny and"], [197, "189 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. severe ; and took the Athen\u00e6um in, in monthly parts, on her own account. She was, in short, a woman of learning and information, and as near an approach to a man as the painstaking philosophical theories of Mr. Featherstone, car ried out with the greatest system and industry, could be expected to produce. That is to say, she was a most unhappy woman. You could see it in every line of her large physiognomy, along whose strongly -developed outlines unhap piness sat as upon a throne, and looked out with a vain, unquiet, devouring craving for that which was not and could not be. The woman's heart thirsted for what would satisfy it, and only the intelligence of the woman \u2014 including the comprehension that she was least of all what she was meant to be \u2014 had been taken at all into feeding and gratification, and in a long course of natural deduction had resulted in a deep, stifled, but not the less all-pervading and settled discontent. The expression of Rosanna's deep-set, livor environed eyes, the melancholy and yet stern and settled intonation of her voice, her habits of harsh and abrupt command, the general man-"], [198, "190 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. like effect of her tall and strongly-developed osseous conformation, her expansive, and, one might almost say rugged, overhanging brows, all announced the effect of education in disquali fying the creature subjected to it from its proper offices and place in the ordination of things by their Maker. And thence it followed that whenever the female nature of the poor woman asserted itself, and an attempt at the seductive and feminine in playfulness and attraction was made, it produced rather an effect of alarm or ridicule in the sex aimed at, than any species of reciprocation. It was thus that thrown back upon itself the heart of this woman preyed upon itself, and produced singular phenomena of results. She loved her uncle as the only man who really took an interest in her welfare, and ex tended to her protection and affection. And yet she hated him as the cause of her being in all ways and in all forms deprived of her proper vitality as a woman. On his part he both loved and vaguely dreaded in his heart his own work \u2014 the female Frankenstein of his own creation, the woman"], [199, "191 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. of vehement but suppressed and apparently powerless passions. The woman of large intel lectual powers subdued into acquiescence, poor ruin ! \u2014 almost, as he deemed, into satisfaction \u2014 at the loss of the main faculties of enjoyable ex istence as a woman at all. As has been said, in the full success of his system, after training and feeling assured of the lasting companionship of the niece he himself most preferred, Mr. Featherstone was haunted by a vague but strongly intuitive conviction that he did not understand the compounded nature he had himself manufactured, and that his \" Solomon in petticoats\" was a great deal more difficult a combination to foresee against, than the headlong, unrestrained, naturally-im pelled character of that Charlotte Clanbrassey, whose process of making herself into a Mrs. Marrynett, and the mother of six daughters, had excited in his breast so strong and so last ing an indignation. And yet Rosanna had never given him the slightest occasion for alarm or animadversion. She had resigned herself apparently to his guidance, bodily and mental ; and with the exception of a very early attempt"], [200, "192 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. at supplying the loss of her sister with Edward Malton \u2014 who was now a stout, middle-aged clergyman, with a good living at a distance from Featherstone, and three children \u2014 could not have been suspected of the smallest ten dency to desert those maxims of celibacy and relinquishment of the noxious association of the other sex, with which he had laboured so suc cessfully to imbue her mind. Rosanna was, in fact, to perfection what is called a strong-minded woman, as well as a strong-bodied one. She could reason as pro soundly as any uncle in the world on politics and government ; she had no foolish feminine fancies of any sort ; no puling sentimentality ; hardly any superstition. She was not afraid of anything ; would venture unconcernedly through paddocks grazed by the largest herds of cows with their bull ; would walk miles through soli tary fields without a start or a backvvard glance ; to crown all, took only a manly, reasonable con cern in her dress \u2014 that is to say, often went very slovenly and neglected. But in quitting her female nature in these imperfections, Ro sanna had perhaps also lost most of her finer"], [201, "193 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. qualities of tenderness and compassion, and sensibility to the sufferings of others, that wontedly accompany them. Mr. Featherstone himself had always a shrinking sort of weakness against passing sentence even on his pigs, or poultry, or cattle, but Rosanna Clanbrassey had none. She would order a dog that had been a favourite for years to be hung, Avhen it grew old and impotent, as unconcernedly as direct a carpet to be swept. She consulted reason on all things, and grew hard and insensible and loveless on its dictates, until to many she seemed more like the petrifaction of a woman than a real one of flesh and blood. Neverthe less, under all these frozen externals a volcano glowed and seethed, should it ever find an air hole to let the rending electricity within burst raging forth in the atmosphere ! As it Avas, Mr. Featherstone knew and felt that his niece had erected over him a species of empire which he had never before suffered any thing female to attain. To be sure, he was now older and less qualified for government himseh, or to bustle abroad in the usual avoca tions of a resident landlord and proprietor. VOL. I. 13"], [202, "194 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. Silently, and by very slow degrees certainly, Rosanna had insinuated herself \u2014 or had gradu ally assumed \u2014 a control and management in his affairs, the extent of which he himself scarcely appreciated, or strove, in scorn of his own weakness, to ignore. She grew to receive his rents ; to discuss improvements and alterations with his tenants ; to figure in the foreground in most of his occasions of influence and mastery in the neighbourhood of Featherstone Hall. Power of some kind the woman was deter mined to enjoy ; a sense of life and activity, Avhich her uncle, aware of all he had deprived her of in pursuit of his own crotchets, felt that he could not refuse to her share. The re volt and secession of Charlotte Clanbrassey had, in fact, rendered him nervous as to the strength of his contrivances, and unwilling, like Don Quixote, to put them to any renewed harsh experiment. To speak plainly, Mr. Feather stone had fallen pretty completely under an influence which was none the better for not being strictly and rightfully a petticoat one. He knew, finally, that he himself lived under quite as close a control and surveillance as he"], [203, "195 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. had ever inflicted in his strongest days of arbi trary well-meaning, and that his niece was his suzerain. And yet, Rosanna seemed in all things to study wholly and exclusively her uncle's will and pleasure in whatever she did, and to do her own wishes in the form of carrying out his. She never in any shape openly contradicted him in anything. In compliance with his antipa thies, she had seemed almost totally to relin quish friendship and acquaintance with her two sisters, who had both married in a manner opposed to his inclinations. Philippina, to be sure, resided at a distance \u2014 for many years on the continent. But the close neighbourhood of the Marrynetts seemed not to tempt her, save very rarely, on the most formal occasions of family intercourse, into Liverpool. The haughty Charlotte, on her part, had long ceased to take any pains to conciliate her uncle's favour back again, or to interrupt the dull routine of his menage on the paternal acres with her pre sence. Rosanna had, therefore, no occasion to feign an almost total indifference when one summer evening, as she and her uncle were 13\u20142"], [204, "196 ROSANNA CLANBRASSEY. seated together in their common sitting-room \u2014 she reading a newspaper aloud to him, he occu pied with his eye-glass on, in cleaning a favourite gun \u2014 a servant entered with a letter just arrived by the village postman, Avith the Leamington postmark upon it, and in Mrs. Primmer's hand writing. \" News from Charlotte, I suppose,\" she said, with a yaAvn ; \" another daughter, of course.

Nay, she was even believed to have made a journey on the sly express to Birmingham, in this interval, to secure articles of the newest pattern and device of the sort. She Avould probably have denied it herself, as a weakness unworthy the elevation of her character ; and indeed there was only the statement of a guard who had once been a stable-boy at the Haugh, who declared that he did not know a horse from a steam-engine if he had not seen \" Miss Featherstone \" \u2014 so she was generally called by the people about the place \u2014 sitting in a second-class carriage, muffled up as if she had the toothache.

On the contrary, her still plump and pulpy face was almost violently flushed, and there Avas a glitter in her eyes that seemed due either to a feverish excitement in the blood, or to the extra use of stimulants, at the over-anxious suggestions of her attendants. The Countess de la Mazurka did not look by any means so well. Paris, it must be allowed, makes great demands on the constitution, and all the rouge and dye in the world could not conceal the fact that Madame the Countess de la Mazurka was very worn and haggish. Still she was extremely well-dressed, and had a highly distinguished and scornful air, like a woman that knew her world, and was determined that her world should know her.

The truth is our fair devotee of rank and position in \" society \" had made rather a fiasco of her determined purpose to attain these essen tials, in her opinion, of a fortunate union.

At all events, a great disturbance took place* in the Clanbrassey household, which was followed by a separation in all the forms, between my lord and my lady ; and my lady went to St. Peters burgh, and my lord returned to London ; but not before the niece, in an explosion of exaspe rated vanity, or apprehensive of being accounted"], [223, "215 A CHRISTENING PARTY. jilted in the transaction, had rushed upon an engagement with a gentleman who figured at the Russian prince's gaming tables as a Magyar count, heir to a handsome schloss and estate on the Danube, but who having taken some part on the side of his countrymen, in the then recently suppressed revolt of Hungary, Avas in Paris, a little under a cloud both in means and recognition there. This mysterious man of rank, however, found eloquence sufficient to persuade Philippina of the reality of his pre tensions, while he himself imagined that the niece of an English Government official, and a \" milord,\" must be worth the trouble of marrying. Both parties speedily saw reason to consider themselves taken in in the affair. Indeed, the scandal of the exposure of the Count's real rank and position was so terrible to Philippina's notions that she had remained abroad in very great poverty and abandonment of friends rather than return to face the ridicule that, by some strange process of unreasoning, seems always attached to misfortunes of the kind in \" good society.\" A small allowance was made to her"], [224, "216 A CHRISTENING PARTY. by her uncle, Mr. Featherstone ; but how she contrived to live upon it, and in such good style as she did in Paris during the earlier years of the Second Empire, was a standing marvel to people, even though, to satisfy conjecture, Ma dame the Countess exaggerated the modest pittance afforded to her by her relation into something very handsome indeed, and ascribed a beneficence to her wealthy Liverpool sister which she never showed. But all that was over now. An eminent financier of tbe Second Empire had been suddenly called upon to give an account of more than the flourishing budgets he had helped to concoct, and Philippina found herself in a condition that made her very glad to accede to her brother \u2014 the Indian officer's \u2014 request, that she would take charge of a house in London for him during a three years' leave of absence he had obtained. This gentleman, Kilpatrick Clanbrassey by name, being now a widower of good means, having married the only daughter of a wealthy opium merchant (half-caste, to be sure), and ranking as a colonel in the army, had indeed an intention of retiring altogether from the ser-"], [225, "217 A CHRISTENING PARTY. vice when his leave of absence should be expired. But, of course, the Company was not to know that. Meanwhile he had two young daughters, whose education required looking after; and the worthy Colonel, whose object was chiefly his own relief from trouble and responsibility, thought that a fashionable Parisian lady, who happened to be his sister, was precisely the sort of tutoress and chaperon he required. As yet, however, her brother and his children were only on their passage home, and Philippina was free to go where she thought proper on ex cursions. And she had now most graciously honoured her sister, Mrs. Marrynett's, invitation to attend the christening of her little boy, and communicate to it all the lustre of her rank and sounding title, Avhich it was thought would please Mr. Marrynett, though the poor man certainly needed no addition to his happiness in the birth of his heir, having been ever since in a perfect delirium of delight and self-gratu lation. \" Did ever anybody see such an idiot as my father-in-law-to-be is making of himself?\" Tobias Souchong said to Sir John. \" Did you"], [226, "218 A CHRISTENING PARTY. go on so, daddy, when I was born ?

But even Rosanna Clanbrassey, who had never before been suspected of much enthusiasm for babies, was quite wild in her expressions of delight and admiration of the child. She ad dressed her sister, Philippina, almost with the formality of a stranger, but she actually burst into tears over the child. \" Dear me, Rosanna !\" said Mrs. Marrynett}"], [227, "219 A CHRISTENING PARTY. with a rather curiously-derisive laugh in the midst of the praises of the child, \" what's the matter with you now ?

And only the more certainly so, that Mr. Mar rynett, and several other knowing cards in that way, had taken him and his speculations in hand, and were forming one of their companies to work out a favourite dream of the Welsh M.P., that a mountain he possessed in Carnar vonshire was as rich in copper ore as the famous Paris one, with whose stratifications Pendragon Mohr was declared to correspond. Sir John Souchong disliked speculation in eArerything but tea, and was much vexed that his partner had of late taken to dabbling in these mining matters, though he gave him full credit for knowing the proper moment when to retire from anything hazardous.

Rosanna felt an indescribable mixture of emotions, whose sum was anguish, yet most of its ingredients full of a wondrous fascination and delight, to find herself, for probably the first time of her life, made an object of marked attention and deferential liking by a gentleman of position and education suitable to her own.

I hope I am not malicious, but I believe in the first instance that Mr. Pendragon scarcely associated any feminine ideas whatever with that large, appreciative, and ruminating physiog nomy ; that strong, decisive voice ; that grasp of sense and language in expression !

The Countess de la Mazurka tried at it, ever striving to be all things to all men, but she was too ignorant, and could not manage it. Even Mr. Jaxall, who acknowledged Mr. Pendragon as his patron until they could get \" the thing \" afloat, and anything made of it that could be made, cried truce to geological phenomena on the occasion. \" Oh, come, hang it, Mr. Pendragon ; let's sink the shop to-day ; let's be jolly for once, sir !\" he said, declining to handle a curious grotesque lump of some stone fused with an ore which that gentleman produced from his pocket, and announced he had just received from his works in Carnarvonshire.

Mr. Pendragon was delighted with a listener, and poured forth a most eloquent scientific and imaginative elucidation, which seemed quite to convince Rosanna that all he said was gospel. She was clearly unwilling to lose a word, giving a deep sigh once or twice as he proceeded, which was very far from being of weariness.

And indeed the electric shock perhaps pierced all the more vitally for being through such very tough and seasoned material.

Tom Souchong's eyes were also wet, but that was because he could not by any means induce Miss Adelaide to look towards him any kind of admission that she was aware of his existence and presence. The Souchong family were, however, in general, quite evidently under a shade.

Considerably to her relatives' surprise, she herself had expressed a wish to remain and enjoy their society, after so long a separation, for a few days longer. She thought the change of air was doing her good \u2014 she felt better already ; and her uncle would not mind her remaining, in that case, for a few days away ; there was nothing particular for her to do at home immediately.

The rest was also of the simplest. After the allusion to the wheat, and some general observations on the healthy condition of the rising crops, Miss Clanbrassey proceeded to state to the intelligent manager that, in compliance with her sister's earnest invitation, she Avas going to stay the week out at Liverpool, so that, if he pleased, he would perhaps be good enough to see that her own poultry and Mr. Featherstone's pheasantry in the Low Copse Wood were properly attended to by the people left in charge ; adding such a trifle as this \u2014 \" I am happy to say I do not"], [307, "299 WAS TO BE MARRIED FOR HER BEAUTY. think it will be necessary for me to go to Scar- borough for change of air, which you so kindly took the trouble to suggest to my uncle.
