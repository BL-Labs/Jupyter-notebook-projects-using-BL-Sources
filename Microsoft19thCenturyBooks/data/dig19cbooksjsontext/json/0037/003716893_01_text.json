The post of Chattanooga was commanded by Col. John G. Parkhurst. General Joseph J. Reynolds was made chief of staff. 3"], [8, "4 FOURTH ARMY CORPS. Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. This corps was organized at Chattanooga, after the battle of Chicka mauga, by consolidating the Twentieth and Twenty-first Corps and adding a portion of the Reserve Corps. It was composed of the divis ions of Crust (First), Sheridan (Second), and Wood (Third). In the battle Crust's division was with Hooker in the storming of Lookout on the 24th of November and in carrying the south end of Missionary Ridge on the 25th. Wood's and Sheridan's divisions carried Orchard Knob and Indian Hill on the afternoon of the 23d, and reversed and held the enemy's works on that line until the afternoon of the 25th, when these divisions, with Sheridan on the right, formed the center of the line for the storming of Missionary Ridge, Sheridan in this assault having Johnson's division of the Fourteenth Corps on his right and Wood having Baird's division of the Fourteenth Corps on his left. In the battle Sheridan's and Wood's divisions of the Fourth Corps, supported by the Eleventh Corps on the left and Baird's division of the Fourteenth Corps in reserve on the right, carried Orchard Knob and Indian Hill to the south of it, constituting the enemy's central line through the plain, in the afternoon of November 23. November 24 Hooker's forces in Lookout \"Valley, consisting of Geary's division of the Twelfth Corps, Crust's of the Fourth, and Osterhaus' of the Fif teenth, carried Lookout Mountain. On the 25th these forces advanced to Rossville Gap and carried the south end of Missionary Ridge in the afternoon of that day. At 3.15 p. m. of the 25th Johnson's, Sheridan's Wood's, and Baird's divisions, formed from right to left in the order named, starting from the central line captured on the 23d, assaulted and carried first the enemy's rifle-pits at the base of the Ridge, and immediately thereafter the central line of Missionary Ridge for a dis tance of three miles. The whole movement occupied a little over an hour, and the captures were 40 guns and about 2,000 prisoners. FIRST DIVISION (FOURTH CORPS).* Brig. Gen.

At daylight of the 24th, Whitaker's brigade was sent to General Geary, at Wauhatchie, crossed Lookout Creek under his command, and took part with Geary's line in the successful assault on the mountain. Grose's brigade was sent at first to the bridges, near the mouth of Lookout Creek, and later four regiments of the brigade crossed half a mile further up the creek and joined Geary's left. The remaining two regiments fought along the turnpike crossing the point of the mountain. At daylight of the 25th a detachment of the Eighth Kentucky, of Whitaker's brigade, climbed the palisades to the highest point of the mountain and unfurled their flag at sunrise from the point. On the 25th, the division moved with General Hooker's command to Rossville, carried the south end of Missionary Ridge, and continued to press northward along the crest, with Osterhaus' division on the right east of the Ridge, and Geary's on the left west of the Ridge, until the position was abandoned by the enemy.

General Baird's division was on its right and General Wood's on its left. On the afternoon of November 23 it supported General Wood's division in a movement on Orchard Knob, itself carrying the low ridge to the right aud rear of this knob. On the morning of the 25th Harker's brigade pushed back the enemy's pickets, and the division moved forward to the next ridge so as to prolong General Wood's line. At 3.15 p. m. the division took part in the storming of Missionary Ridge, moving against and capturing the enemy's rifle-pits in its front at the base of the Ridge, and, starting from that line, scaled the summit. The center of the divi sion reached the crest very near General Bragg's headquarters. The division, after carrying the crest in its front, pressed on in pursuit, continuing this until dark, with sharp skirmishing and one serious attack upon the enemy's rear-guard.

On November 23, supported on the right bv Sheridan's divis ion and on the left by the Eleventh Corps, it formed the column of attack on Orchard Knob. It deployed in front of Fort Wood at 1.30 p. in., moved directly upon the knob, and after short but sharp fighting car ried the position. It reversed the enemy's works and added new ones, and remained in this position until 3.15 p. m. November 25, when it moved to the assault of Missionary Ridge with Baird's division on its left and Sheridan's and Johnson's on its right, in the order named. It carried the enemy's rifle-pits in its front at the foot of the ridge, which completed the movement covered by the orders given this part of the line. The men, however, who first reached the rifle-pits kept on and began the ascent of the ridge, and carried it without a halt. The other divisions of the assaulting column to the right and left also went for ward to the summit, which was carried at six points at nearly the same time, and in about an hour from the beginning of the movement. Fifteen hundred men of Hazen's brigade of this division manned the boats which floated down to Brown's Ferry, and made the successful landing at that point at 5 a. m. of November 27, which resulted in reopening the Tennessee River. The rest of the brigade, under Lieutenant-Colonel Bassett Langdon, First Ohio, co-operated from the right bank of the river opposite the landing point. FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS. Maj. Gen. John M.

Johnson (First), Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis (Second), and Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird (Third). It occupied the fortifications of Chattanooga from Fort Negley to the Tennessee River below the city, its right being established upon the south points of the spurs extending southerly from Cameron Hill. The First and Third divisions took part in the battle in front of Chatta nooga, the Second was sent to prepare for and cover the crossing of General Sherman's army over the Tennessee, opposite the north point of Missionary Ridge. Carlin's brigade, of Johnson's division, ascended Lookout Mountain, toward evening of the 24th, from the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, and reenforced the right of General Hooker's line under the palisades, near the Craven House. The First and Second brigades of this division formed the right of the four storming divis ions of the Army of the Cumberland against Missionary Ridge. Baird's division supported Sheridan in the movement on the Orchard Knob line of the enemy on the afternoon of November 23, and on the morning of the 25th it was sent to the vicinity of the Tunnel to support General Sher man's attack at that point, but there being no room for it to operate it returned and formed north of Orchard Knob and on the left of General WTood's division of the Fourth Corps, and became the left of the line in the storming of Missionary Ridge. \"General Baird's instructions to his line before the advance began contemplated an advance to the summit, as did the int-tructions given in the other division of the Fourteenth Corps (Johnson's), which formed the right of the assaulting fine.

It moved forward during the after noon of the 23d November, forming between the Rossville and Moore roads as a protection to General Sheridan's right in the movement toward Orchard Knob. It remained in this position until Wednesday morning, Nov. 25th, when, by a reconnoissance of Van Derveer's brigade, it developed the fact that the enemy had withdrawn from the plain south of Chattanooga. About 11 o'clock the division was ordered to the assist ance of General Sherman, then engaged at Tunnel Hill. Upon reach ing that point, four miles distant, the division was ordered to return and form on the left of General Wood's division, which then rested on Orchard Knob, with its left a short distance north of that point. In this position the division became the left of the line formed for the movement against Missionary Ridge. The orders given this portion of the line before the movement began contemplated its going to the top.

The next day Gen eral Hooker was ordered by General Rosecrans to cross the Tennessee at Bridgeport and co-operate in reopening the river to Chattanooga, but as the field trains of the corps had not arrived it was impossible to move. These arrived on the 26th. Hooker started at daylight of the 27th for Wauhatchie, reaching that point early the next afternoon, and Brown's Ferry two hours later. The command took part with troops from the Army of the Cumberland in the Brown's Ferry movement for reopening the river. It defeated General Longstreet's forces in the battle of AVavThatchie the night of October 28, and secured control of Lookout Valley.

During the operations of November 24 the division was commanded by Brig. Gen. H. K. Jackson in the temporary absence of General Cheatham. November 15 General Jackson, having previously held a part of the line between the base of Lookout and Chattanooga Creek, established the headquarters of the division on the mountain at the junction of the Summertown road with the road leading to the Craven (White) house, and was assigned to the command of the forces operating at and near that house. On the morning of November 24, General Wal thall's brigade was west of the Craven house, Moore's brigade being to the right and rear of it and extending down the mountain toward Chat tanooga Creek. General Wright's brigade was detached holding the post at Charleston, Tenn., and on the evening of the 23d was moved by rail to Chickamauga Station and thence to the bridge over the Chick amauga east of Tunnel Hill, which position it held during the battle. On the 23d Jackson's brigade, which had been put in position near the Craven house, was ordered to the foot of the mountain to occupy a part of the line from which General Walker's division had been withdrawn. The brunt of the fighting on the mountain was sustained by General Walthall's command until the line had been flanked and pushed back to the Craven house by General Hooker's overwhelming numbers. Later General Pettus's brigade was sent from the top of the mountain from General Stevenson's division and moved from the SummertoAvn road toward General Walthall's position, joining him after the position at the Craven house had been carried by the enemy. A line in rear of the Craven house and in advance of the Summertown road was held by Walthall, Pettus, and Moore till dark.

This division reached the eastern base of Missionary Ridge from Chickamauga Station the evening of November 23. It had reached the latter station on its way to report to General Longstreet at Knoxville. At dawn of the 24th it began to throw up earthworks along the crest of the ridge from General Bragg's headquarters to the Shallow Ford road. At 2 p. m. it was dispatched in haste to Tunnel Hill to confront General Sherman's forces. Upon reaching Tuunel Hill, at 2.30 p. m., Smith's Texas brigade was moved forward to occupy the detached range north of Missionary Ridge, but found it in possession of General Sherman's forces. The division was established 'about Tunnel Hill during the night. Smith's brigade held the central knoll over the tunnel, three regiments consolidated under Col. R. Q.
