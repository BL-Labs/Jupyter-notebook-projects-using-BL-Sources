To render the collection complete, it should comprise three sets \u2014 one of which should be arranged lithologically, to illustrate the composition, structure, and physical aspect of the rocks ; a second, stratigraphi cally, to illustrate the order of succession of the several formations ; and a third, topographically, to illustrate their geographical dis tribution. In this collection the stratigraphical arrangement has been selected, as Ifest adapted to afford special and general knowledge of the characters and aspect of the various rocks met with in each formation, while the colored label on each specimen, when compared with the similarly colored geological maps, shows approximately their geographical distribution. There are two labels on each speci men : the colored one indicates the formation to which the specimen belongs, the locality, and the reference number on the maps ; the other is the Descriptive Catalogue number for each formation. Some of the specimens show examples of the fossils characteristic of the formation to which they belong ; but a separate and complete collection of fossils, arranged stratigraphically, and named and described by Professor McCoy, is being prepared, and will fully illustrate the Pal\u00e6ontology of Victoria. The minerals are also arranged as a separate collection, and numbered consecutively to agree with the Descriptive Catalogue. The published geological quarter-sheet maps, referred to on the specimen labels, are exhibited on the walls contiguous to the cases. Each map represents fifty-four square miles of country, and a copy of the geologically-colored sketch-map of the whole colony, on a scale of eight miles to one inch, is also exhibited. On the above-mentioned maps are letters and numbers \u2014 thus (Fs) \u2014 which"], [10, "INTRODUCTION. IV correspond with letters and numbers on the colored specimen labels, and thus indicate the exact spot on the map where each specimen was collected, and the formation it belongs to. The letters R, F, M., on the maps and labels, show whether the specimen is Rock, Fossil, or Mineral. Illustrative horizontal sections, similar to the one accompanying I sheet 14 S.W., Maldon, will eventually be constructed for all the more interesting -j sheets ; and a system of lettering on the face of the map has been adopted, by which the student can easily ascertain the probable nature of the formations underlying those that occupy the surface (depicted by the color on the map) of any given area. The letter G. indicates Granite ; C, Lower Silurian ; S., Upper Siluiian ; V., Volcanic ; T., Tertiary, &c. ; and the number attached to the letter indicates the probable mineral or lithological character of the rock. Thus, VI. on TP3. on Cl. 2., indicates Volcanic formation (basalt) resting on Pliocene Tertiary gravel, or \" lower gold drift,\" on a bottom of Lower Silurian slate and sandstone. The arrangement of the specimens described in flhis Catalogue was planned and superintended by myself. The descriptions are the joint work of myself and colleagues, Messrs. Ulrich, Aplin, Etheridge, and Taylor. The analyses, when not otherwise stated, have been made by Mr. J. Cosmo Newbery, Analyst to the Survey. ALFRED R C. SELWYN, Dir. Geo. Survey of Victoria. Geological Survey Office, May, 1868."], [11, "DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE, IGNEOUS ROCKS. PLUTONIC AND VOLCANIC. The relations of these rocks indicate that they have, for the most part, been forced upwards from the interior of the earth in a fluid or semi-fluid (viscous) state. They have penetrated and overflowed other formations, and then become solid under varying conditions, either on or beneath the surface. The soft state in which they existed was probably due to great heat \u2014 hence the term \" Igneous rocks ;\" and their texture, as we now find them, is the result, partly, of the particular conditions under which they became solid, and is partly due to subse quent metamorphism. They are either compact, porphyritic, or crys talline granular, seldom fissile, but frequently vesicular or amygdaloidal. They also often occur in a wackenitic state (wacke*), this form being, in Victoria, very characteristic osthe rocks osthe Older Volcanic series. As volcanic ash, they occur in stratified layers, having much the appearance of true sedimentary aqueous rocks. They are classed under two principal divisions, expressive of their origin. 1. Plutonic \u2014 or those that became solid at a considerable depth in the interior of the earth (consequently under great pres- sure), and have been exposed at the surface by the removal of the once superincumbent strata. 2. Volcakic \u2014 or those that have been forced to the surface, and either flowed over it in a molten state, or been spread over it as ash. These again may be divided into two classes expressive of their constitution : \u2014 1. Acidic \u2014 or those rich in silica. 2. Basic \u2014 or those poor in silica. The average composition of these two classes of igneous rocks is, according to Cotta \u2014 Basic rocks. Acidic rocks.

The separation between the two groups canuot bo very rigidly carried out, as certain rocks of each group vary so greatly in their com position as actually to graduate into the opposite one. This is also the case as regards the Plutonic and Volcanic divisions, there being no definite depth of measurement that can be fixed as a boundary between these two kinds of formations : thus, each of the four groups may be characterized by some typical rock, and each may also be connected with the other group by means of rocks of an intermediate character and origin. The groups may be represented as follows \u201e ( Acidic Plutonic < t> \u25a0 ( Basic TT ( Acidic Volcanic < \u201e \u25a0 ( Basic . ( Plutonic Acidic - jVolcanic _, I Plutonic Basic ... { Volcanic Granite ) 0 .. Diorite } Syemte- Trachyte ) Porphyrite. Basalt j Trachy-dolerite. Granite ) Quartz porphyry. Trachyte } Trachyte porphyry. Diorite 1 Melaphyre. Basalt ) Diabase porphyrite. The former state of fusion of the Volcanic division of the igneous rocks is evident, as they may still be seen in process of formation from the lava of active volcanoes. In the case of the other, or Plutonic division, their previous igneous fluidity is not always so apparent ; and it seems not improbable that some granites, as well as other rocks of this class, are the result of the gradual metamorphism, in place, of stratified sedimentary rocks, through the effects of long-continued thermo-chemical action, in pre sence of water, and under high pressure, ' but unaccompanied by any such great heat as would be required to cause igneous fluidity. In any case it seems quite certain that many changes have taken place in the character and composition of igneous rocks subsequently to their first formation, causing the introduction or development in them of what are termed accessory minerals, chiefly, no doubt, under the influence of watery solutions and gases penetrating and permeating them. In this sense, nearly all rocks are, more or less, metamorphic, or, in other words, have assumed different mineral characters from what they pos sessed, either as original sediments or molten masses. This is not generally caused by the addition of new substances, but, in most cases, only through the re-arrangement, under peculiar chemical and physical influences, according to their affinities, of certain original constituents of the rock, resulting in the development of distinct minerals, and thus forming rocks, which, though differing greatly in external appearance, would not vary more in their ultimate chemical constituents than any two distinct pieces of sandstone, slate, or granite. Gk-_nite is the principal rock of the Plutonic division osthe acidic igneous rocks. It consists of a crystalline granular compound, in vari able proportions, of felspar, quartz, and mica. In certain varieties there occur chlorite, talc, hornblende, and schorl. The felspar, chiefly ortho clase, is usually the predominant ingredient, the mica occupying the smallest place in typical granite. It is uncertain whether albite or"], [13, "IGNEOUS rocks. 3 labradorite ever occur in the granitic compound, the species of triclinic felspar, often observed in it and generally supposed to be albite, having been found to be \"oligoclase.\" The ingredients commonly considered as essential for granite are, nevertheless, sometimes replaced by others ; and we consequently find many transitions from granite into other rocks, such as granitic porphyry, quartz porphyry, protogine (talcose granite), schorl rock, felstone, felspar porphyry, syenite, and greenstone : these latter rocks passing into the porphyritic, syenite, and greenstone groups, or the basic igneous rocks of the Plutonic division. Some of the speci mens illustrate these transitions. Syenite is a granular compound of orthoclase and hornblende. Porphyrite consists of a felsitic matrix, with individual crystals of felspar (oligoclase or orthoclase), mica, or hornblende. Greenstone is a compound of some species of felspar (not ortho- clase) with hornblende, hypersthene, or augite. This class of rock is never found in the form of genuine lava, but always, more or less, shows its Plutonic origin, in which probably cousists the whole difference (not very great) between it and the basalts, or the basic igneous rocks of the Volcanic division. It is highly probable that the same basic compound which, consolidating near the surface, produced the basaltic rock, when it attained the solid state at a greater depth, formed the greenstone. The basalts and greenstones, consequently, in general very much re- semble each other, both in chemical composition and mineral character. The chlorite, by which some osthe greenstones are alone distinguishable from the basalts, is usually a product of transmutation. The following are some of the minerals occasionally found as accessories in granitic rocks : \u2014 Garnet, topaz, beryl, fluor spar, calcite, corundum, zircon, titanite, gold, oxide of tin, magnetic iron-ore, molybdenite, mispickel, __c. Tin-ore, gold, titanite, magnetic iron, and corundum, occur in con- siderable quantity in the detrital matter in many of the granite districts in Victoria. No specimens showing these minerals embedded in granite have yet been found,* and their occurrence in the drifts can only be explained, either by supposing them to have been originally dis- tributed as grains through the mass of the rock in the detritus of which they are now found, or that veins containing these minerals traversed the strata which doubtless once covered the granite, and have since been entirely broken up and removed by denuding forces, which were not able to transport the heavier minerals. No veins or lodes have been found containing tin-ore, nor are there any authen- ticated instances in Victoria of auriferous quartz veins in the granite, though fragments of vein quartz, as well as of gneiss, mica, schist, and other metamorphic strata are not uncommon in the detritus that rests on the granite, and often contains rich deposits of tin-ore, fine gold with titanite, corundum, black tourmaline, zircon, sapphire, diamond, and other precious stones. * Gold, and a new mineral compound, supposed to be gold and bismuth, occurs in granite veins associated with tbe Nuggetty Reef, Maldon.

In width it varies from 2 to 5 chains, and is traceable for 4 miles south of the Kyneton Road cutting, where it appears to pass into a thin granitic dyke, accompanied by greenstone. It is extensively used in Heathcote, both for building and kerbing, the harder varieties being well adapted for these purposes.

Note. \u2014 The greenstone (diorite) composing the range to the east of the parish of Lancefield,is very variable in its lithological character. Mount William, at the extreme northern and highest part of the range, and at its junction with the Great Dividing Range, is composed of a very hard, dark-greenish-black, dense rock (aphanite), closely resembling a basalt, and with a metallic ring, when struck, like clinkstone ; passing south wards to a lighter green, hard rock, with crystals of triclinic felspar, some times having the appearance of a greenish-white rock, with black dendritic (hornblendic) markings. This stone (see \" Building Stone Cubes,\" R 30, 31, and 32), were it not for its extreme hardness, and consequent difficulty and expense in quarrying and working up, would make a very hand some stone for building or ornamental purposes. Further south it passes into a black, highly crystalline, hornblendic rock, and then again to a dark-green dense rock, with specks of iron pyrites. Near the centre of this range (see | sheet 5 S.E.) is a fault cutting off the greenstone. Its place is supplied by a very rich and heavy brown iron-ore, or hematite (see Mineral Collection, Case 13, No. 36). The greenstone weathers externally to a rusty-brown color. The unfossiliferous Silurian shales, resting as small outliers on the top of this greenstone range (probably the remains of a denudation of the sandstone upheaved by it), and also the contiguous rocks on the west side, are all highly metamorphosed, the shales being converted into a hard jaspery porcelanite. About a mile N.E. of Mount William is the site (locally called \" The Native Toma hawk Quarries\"), whence the aboriginal tribes of the neighboring districts have procured the greenstone used by them for making tomahawks. From the amount of broken stone covering a large area, this quarry must have been in use for a very lengthened period. Those marked with an \u2022 occur as dykes (Elvans)."], [27, "PLUTONIC ROCKS.

Note. \u2014 The diorite specimen 67, composed of pinkish felspar and black hornblende, was taken from a peculiar intrusive mass of rock, several acres in extent, that in most places, where exposed, consists of diorite, but assumes at others granitic, syenitic, porphyritic and brecciated characters. Thus, at its junction with the black graptolite slates ofthe neighborhood, where several small faults have been traced (see sketch on \\ sheet 1 5 N.E.), the rock bears the character of porphyry, more or less de- composed ; whilst at another place, scarcely four chains off, the accession of black mica and some quartz renders the rather decomposed rock undis- tinguishable from decomposing granite ; and from one of the small shafts, sunk for the purpose of examination, specimens of \" epidosite \" (vide No. 70) were also obtained. In small cavities of the porphyritic variety, crystals of \" albite,\" associated with abnormally formed quartz crystals, occur, and it was therefore probable that the felspar, entering into the composition of the rock, might also be \" albite,\" though the absence of the characteristic twinstriation on its cleavage planes gives it all the appearance of orthoclase.

(see No. 6, Table of Analyses) proves it, however, clearly to be \" albite,\" and the rock is therefore diorite, according to rocent views on petro graphical classification. The adjoining sossiliferous strata are not, or but very slightly, altered, and hand specimens can easily be obtained, in which one half consists of black slate, with well preserved graptolites, and the other of the porphyritic variety of the intrusive rock. The brecciated variety, apparently a mixture of chips of Silurian rock and of the dioritic paste, occurs in places only along the boundary of the two formations. *71.

As the whole of this area lies lower than the bottom of the rent in the rim of the crater, it is probable that its own, and the drainage down the inside walls of the latter, having no direct outflow, soaks off through the porous basalt of the mantle, and contributes largely to the numerous springs around the foot of the Mount.\" \u2014 (Part of Note 1, I sheet 15 S.E.) \" Towards the north end of the crater, a narrow and very pre cipitous rent in its side exposes thick, variously colored beds of volcanic ash, cinders and scori\u00e6-conglomerate, which dip at an angle of 17\u00b0 towards the centre of the Mount.

According to the different origin and mode of formation of these rocks they may be divided into three classes : \u2014 1. Mechanical Deposits. a. Accumulated and stratified by water (aqueous). b. Accumulated and stratified by wind (aerial). 2. Chemical Precipitates. 3. Organic Processes. a. From the growth and accumulation of animal matter (zoogenic). b. Erom the growth and accumulation of vegetable matter (phytogenic). The above three classes may again be divided, according to their lithological and mineral characters, into the five following groups : \u2014 1. Arenaceous or Siliceous ... ... Sand 2. Argillaceous or Aluminous ... ... Clay 3. Calcareous ... ... ... ... Lime 4. Ferruginous ... ... ... ... Iron 5. Carbonaceous ... ... ... ... Coal, Lignite, &c. Nearly all sedimentary rocks are stratified, that is, they lie in beds or layers, one above the other, and often quite parallel for long distances. With few exceptions these beds or layers are made up of larger or smaller fragments and particles (debris) of pre-existing rocks, washed together and deposited from a state of suspension in water. A few only are the result of chemical precipitate of mineral substances from aqueous solution \u2014 gypsum, rocksalt and some limestones, \u2014 and these usually possess a crystalline structure, not otherwise observed in \" unaltered \" rocks of sedimentary origin. Many contain organic remains (fossils), more or less distinct, while some are entirely composed of such. Most of these organisms are supposed to have lived and died in the water, at the bottom of which the sediment was being deposited, that now forms the rock they are now embedded in. Others, chiefly vegetable, have been washed or otherwise transported off adjoining dry land, or the land, on which they existed, has been submerged, and thus covered with sand, mud, or silt. Respecting the igneous or unstratified rocks, it has been stated, that no marked line can be drawn between the various classes and subdi visions, as they are found, both in their physical and mineral characters and in their lithological relations, to merge into each other. This characteristic is also more or less common to the sedimentary and strati fied rocks. The several sedimentary deposits have been divided into \" formations \" according to the order of their superposition, and conse quently of their age, and these are gathered iuto four groups, repre senting longer periods of deposit : \u2014 1. Primary, or Pal\u00e6ozoic. 2. Secondary, or Mesozoic. 3. Tertiary, or Cainozoic. 4. Post Tertiary, or recent. These divisions have no reference to mineral or lithological cha racter, and no specimen of rock \u2014 such as sandstone, clay-slate, shale,"], [42, "32 stratified or sedimentary rocks. conglomerate, breccia, limestone, &c. \u2014 is exclusively confined to, or characteristic of, any geological age or formation ; and therefore the geological age of a deposit will in no case afford information respecting the nature of the rock or its petrographic character. These characters are almost entirely dependent on circumstances, varying in each locality or country, and on the nature of the formation, from which the material, forming the rock, has been supplied, as well as on the physical influences, to which it may have been subjected since its origiual deposition. Thus, in the stratigraphical arrangement, adopted in this collection, specimens of sandstone, shale, conglomerate, breccia, limestone, ironstone, &c. occur in each geological period ; and it may be observed, that some of the most recent Tertiary rock specimens are quite as hard, solid and compact as those, that belong to Secondary or Primary formations ; and others, differing widely in geological age, are almost identical in their composition, texture and appearance. Sandstone. \u2014 A typical sandstone may be described as consisting of small grains of some solid mineral, usually quartz, bound together into a solid rock, either by some cementing medium or by simple pressure. If the grains are fine, it is a fine-grained sandstone ; if coarse, a coarse grained sandstone, (fee. If the cementing medium is lime, it becomes a calcareous sandstone ; if iron, a ferruginous sandstone, &c. As the grains increase in size, it becomes either a grit or a conglomerate. If the particles are angular, a breccia. Argillaceous Shale and Clay- Slate are laminated clay-rocks, formed from sediments of clayey mud, and have assumed their present form by a slow process of transmutation and mechanical consolidation. Admix tures of other matter, either during decomposition or subsequently, frequently render them either arenaceous, carbonaceous, micaceous, ferruginous, calcareous, or bituminous, as the case may be. They may both be described as laminated fissile rocks ; in the one instance this texture is due to original stratification, and in the other to slaty cleavage. Clay-slate, though also distinctly stratified, does not readily separate, except along the cleavage-planes, which are quite independent of its original bedding. It is not confined to any particular geological period, although the genuine clay-slates (roofing-slate, &c.) usually occur only in the older formations. There are, however, exceptions to this rule, and in the Swiss Alps genuine roofing-slates and also common arena ceous and micaceous clay-slates are found belonging to the chalk and even to the Tertiary periods. The origin of slaty cleavage is still unsettled, but it is now generally supposed to be due to great lateral pressure, induced by forces in connection with the upheaval, disturbance and contortion of the rocks, in which it occurs. It is more or less a characteristic feature of all the Lower Silurian and older rocks of Victoria, but is seldom, if ever, observed in any formation in Victoria newer than Upper Silurian. Sedimentary rocks are frequently much changed by infiltration of mineral matter or other metamorphic action, that tends to obliterate their original mechanical, granular structure, and they assume a semi-crystal line appearance, not unlike some rocks of undoubted igneous origin and are then classed as Metamorphic Rocks."], [43, "primary or pal\u00e6ozoic rocks. 33 PRIMARY OR PAL\u00c6OZOIC ROCKS. LOWER PAL\u00c6OZOIC. SILURIAN. (Metamorphic and Unaltered.) No formation that can be identified clearly as older than Lower Silurian has yet been recognized in Victoria. Perhaps, however, the rocks of some of the larger areas, mapped as metamorphic, represent a Cambrian or Laurentian series. In any case, much of the Lower Silurian is metamorphic, especially near the boundaries of granite masses. A large number of fossils have been collected, by the Geological Survey, from all parts of the colony, many of which are generically and specifically identical with those found in strata of Upper and Lower Silurian age in other countries. Specimens of some of them are exhi- bited in the Pal\u00e6ontological collection, and figures and descriptions of the most interesting are being prepared by Professor McCoy for publication in the \" Memoirs of the Museum.\" The geological sketch- map shows that the Silurian rocks (represented by grey or slate color) occupy a very large surface area : they also constitute, with a few local exceptions, the true \"bottom\" or \"bed rock\" of all the Victorian goldfields, as well as the matrix or bounding walls of every known metal- liferous vein, dyke, or reef ; and they doubtless underlie, at a lesser or greater depth, a large portion of those tracts, where newer formations are found on the surface. The depth to which they are covered, and the age of the overlying formation, will, in each case, approximately determine the probable limits of any deep alluvial gold lead, because when it (the- Tertiary deposit, or formation, in which the gold lead occurs) passes on to such newer and non-auriferous rocks, the supply of gold is, as it were, cut off; and though the gravel continues and presents no apparent difference, the lead at once becomes unprofitable. The Lower Silurian argillaceous beds are characterized by a more or less slaty and schistose structure, whilst the Upper consist mostly of jointed, rubbly, or concretionary shales and soft mudstones. Sandstones and sandy beds are common in both series. Only one limestone band (in the Upper) has yet been found, and even calcareous beds are rarely met with. Bands of conglomerate are also very rare, and the greater part of the formation seems to have been deposited in deep water. A considerable unconformity exists between the Upper and Lower series, and the total thickness of both is, probably, not less that 30,000 feet. Building Stones. \u2014 Beds of freestone, generally a greenish-brown sandstone, are frequently met with, and are quarried for local building purposes. The stone can, however, seldom be procured of a uniform color and texture, in large quantity ; and on this account, as well as from its being very subject to decay, when exposed to atmospheric action, the Silurian sandstone is not suitable for any exteusive architectural or D"], [44, "34 PRIMARY OR PAL\u00c6OZOIC ROCKS. CASE VII. engineering purposes. Examples of some of them are exhibited in the collection of dressed building stones. In the neighborhood of Castle maine, Sandhurst, Maryborough and other goldfields' towns, quarries have been opened, and the stone has been used in the construction of some of the banks and other public and private buildings. Flagging. \u2014 Excellent, blue flags or paving-stones occur in several districts. Those procured from Specimen Gully, near Castlemaine, are most extensively used, and will doubtless, ere long, supersede the imported Scotch flagging. Slates. \u2014 Roofing-slates have been procured from several localities ; but the quality of those hitherto brought into the market is very inferior. The best, as yet, are from Glen Maggie Creek, a tributary of the Macalister River, in Gippsland. No quarry has been opened there, and probably the cost of transport would preclude the slates being raised profitably at present. Case VII. LOWER SILURIAN, Metamorphic in part.) 1.

The specimens placed under the above heading are collected from groups of strata that occur in widely separated, more or less isolated, patches, from the Glenelg to the Snowy River. No remains of a fossil fauna have as yet been found in them, and fossil plants in a few localities only, viz. : Bacchus Marsh, the valley of the Devil's River, the valley of the Avon in Gippsland and on Mount Tambo. The greatest development of these rocks occurs to the westward, in the Grampians, Victoria, Serra and Dundas ranges ; and to the eastward, in North Gippsland, extending from Bushy Park and Lindenow north-westerly to Ben Cruachan and Mount Wellington, whence they probably also extend in outlying patches across the Dividing Range to the valley of the Devil's River. They are certainly intermediate in age between the Upper Silurian, on the one hand, aud the Carbonaceous or coal-bearing rocks on the other, which latter almost certainly rest on them under the greater part of the Gippsland plains, from Hayfield and Mewburn Park to Rosedale, Sale, Stratford, Lake Wellington, &c, and if so, preclude the existence of auriferous deep leads under these plains. The litho logical character of the different beds, and the general physical aspect and prevailing color of the formation bear a very close resemblance to those of the Lower Carboniferous and Devonian formations of Britain. (For further details, see \" Notes on the Physical Geography, Geology, and Mineralogy of Victoria\" \u2014 Intercolonial Exhibition Essays, 1866.) Traces of copper have been found in the shales of this formation on the Devil's River, and thin veins of micaceous iron-ore occur in the Grampians. Good freestone for building purposes, grindstones and flags for paving can be procured from these rocks in various localities. In South Australia the copper lodes are associated with similar rocks, and with veins of micaceous iron-ore, also with thick beds of crystalline, white-and-grey marble or limestone. The latter has not been observed in Victoria, and it seems probable that the lower beds of the formation, with which, in South Australia, these valuable deposits are associated, are not represented here.

Inter stratified, thin beds of very coarse conglomerate, or pudding-stone, frequently occur ; but fossils seem to be entirely absent. The sandstone has been used in several buildings in Kyneton aud the neighborhood. It is soft and easily worked, but cannot be procured of uniform color in large quantities ; and, though it sometimes seems to harden on exposure, it is very liable to exfoliate, and is, therefore, not a good building stone. The quarries are now abandoned. The Tertiary (Newer Pliocene) gold-bearing gravel beds overlie it in several places. The basalt, which overlies both, seems to have caused an alteration into hard, coarse quartz grit, numbers of large angular pieces of which are scattered round the respective boundaries. 20.

The conglomerate consists of a bluish-grey, very hard mud cement, sometimes having a slight yellow tinge (specimen 46), and in places interstratified with veins of an alumi- nous mineral. It becomes much lighter in color by exposure and soon crumbles to pieces. The pebbles contained in it vary much in size and consist of granites of various colors and textures, principally red and white ; porphyries, indurated sandstones, quartz, red, white and blue, flinty quartzites ; and a peculiar flint-colored rock, with red felspar crystals, weathering white. From one of the cortetituents of this latter rock having externally decomposed in horizontal lines, it has the appear- ance, at first sight, of gneiss. This deposit forms a very good, red soil, but is boggy and rotten in winter. At this locality it is very thin, the Silurian rocks cropping up in the almost flat gullies. On the Wild Duck Creek, however, a fine section \u2014 in many places at least 90 feet above the level of the creek \u2014 may be seen under Robertson's Station (specimens 48, 49 and 50). The conglomerate is here capped by a yellowish grit (specimen 50), and rests on yellow sandstone (specimen 49), forming large open downs. About two miles higher up the Wild Duck Creek, near Wilton's Station, the beds may be seen filling up depressions in the upturned edges of the Lower Silurian. 51. Copper Slate. 52. Limestone.

Plant remains of numerous genera and species have been found in them. A new species of Unio ( Unio Dacombii \u2014 McCoy) is the only fossil animal yet discovered. Coal and freestone are the only minerals known, as occurring in quantity sufficient to be economically valuable. The coal seams are for the most part, although of good quality, too thin to be profitably worked. With the exception of those near Cape Patter son, none have been discovered that would yield as much as 20 inches of good coal, and these generally occur in very inaccessible positions. Basalt and other forms of volcanic rock are the only igneous rocks associated with the Carbonaceous strata. Calc-spar frequently occurs, as veins, in the joints and fissures of the rock. The formation does not apparently contain any metallic minerals, except iron in the form of carbonate (clay iron-ore) and oxide ; but neither occur in sufficient quantity to be of economic value. The coal rocks probably extend eastward, under a great part of the Gippsland plains, south of a line drawn from near Hayfield to Lake Wellington, but cannot be seen on the surface, being thickly overlaid, as at Bellarine and Queenscliff, by Tertiary rocks and recent alluvial deposits. The specimens represent the general lithological character of the formation. E"], [60, "secondary or mesozoic ROCKS. CASE XI. 50 Case XI. CARBONACEOUS\u2014 MIOCENE AND OLDER PLIOCENE. MESOZOIC.

When opening the quarries, the beds were found to be very variable in composition, and so full of joints, as to make it both difficult and costly to obtain the stone in quantity, of the uniform texture and quality, essential in large buildings. It constitutes, however, a useful building stone for local purposes, or where small quantities only are required. Excellent grindstones could be procured from some of these beds. The buildings, above referred to, do not present favorable evidence, as regards its durability, when exposed to the atmosphere of the city. Some of the beds are full of fossil-plant remains.

Note. \u2014 The Carbonaceous rocks of the Barrabool Hills, from which specimens Nos. 3, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21 are taken, consist of a series of hard, thick-bedded, brown and grey sandstones, much jointed, and with thin veins of carbonate of lime ; they alternate with shales and conglomerates, and have an average dip of E. 30\u00b0 S., at an inclination of 1 in 4. Over the area comprised between the village of Ceres and the municipality of Newtown and Chilwell, about 3,000 feet of Carbonaceous strata crop out at the surface ; the highest beds are found to the east and the lowest to the west. It is highly probable that this part of the series has been tested for coal in the Bellarine district, since an intermediate synclinal axis exists in the ground between Kensington and Geelong ; and the Barrabool Hills' sandstones, shales, &c, would thus be a recurrence at the surface of those bored through in the Bellarine district. The sand stones of the Barrabool Hills are extensively quarried and used for building purposes in and around Geelong. They are very variable in composition and durability, and their prevailing dull greenish-brown color renders them objectionable for large buildings, in which architec tural effect is required. 22.

TERTIARY OR CAINOZOIC AND RECENT PERIOD. \" The rock formations of the Tertiary, including the recent period, whether regarded in their economical, physical, or geological aspects, occupy by far the most prominent place in Victorian geological history. Strata of sedimentary or volcanic origin, referable to some section of Tertiary or recent time, occupy probably fully one-half, or over 40,000 square miles, of the surface of Victoria, forming deposits from a mere capping to over 300 feet thick. They are found resting unconformably on all the older formations, igneous and stratified, and range from sea level to elevations of over 4,000 feet. They include groups of strata of earth, loam, sand, clay, gravel, conglomerate, ferruginous and calcareous sandstone and grits, hard quartz rocks, marble and other kinds of lime stone, and various volcanic products, each of which has its more or less distinctive geological, pal\u00e6ontological, or mineral character, indicating it to be truly representative of the recognized Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene, or Pleistocene (including recent) deposits of Europe and other countries ; the terms being applied here, however, simply to denote Lower, Middle, Upper and Recent Tertiaries, rather than exact synchronism with Euro pean beds, or any ascertained relative percentage of living and extinct forms in their fossil contents.\" \u2014 (Notes on the Physical Geography, Geology and Mineralogy of Victoria \u2014 Intercolonial Exhibition Essays, 1866.) The Lower Gold Drifts. \" The attention of the Geological Survey has lately been directed to the very important question of the age and probable auriferous or non auriferous character of what are called the ' lower drifts of Victoria.' From the facts observed, the following conclusions have been arrived at : \u2014 \" 1st. That these particular drifts are clearly antecedent in date to the Upper and Middle Miocene beds, under which they have now been traced, and therefore, that they are far older than the lowest Pliocene gravels, to which age the 'deep-lead' gravels of Ballarat, the ' White Hills ' of Bendigo, and other similar rich gold-bearing gravels have been referred. \" 2nd. That they do not probably contain gold in paying quantity, the reason being, that they are derived from the abrasion of quartz veins that themselves contained little or no gold, and that were probably formed by forces in operation, as long prior to those which produced the gold-bearing veins, as the denuda- tion, producing the barren Miocene gravels, was prior to that which gave rise to the Pliocene productive ones.\" The Tertiary formations afford, besides gold, tin-ore, also diamonds and other precious stones, lignite or brown coal, salt, limestones suitable"], [65, "TERTIARY OR CAINOZOIC AND RECENT ROCKS.

Occurs in nodular, earthy masses of a pale smalt-blue color in the older basalt, especially in places, where recent guano deposits exist on the surface -, its origin, in this instance, being most probably due to the water, percolating through the guano, becoming charged with phosphate of ammonia and acting on the iron of the decomposed basalt. Occurs as drusy coatings of brownish red, sub-trausparent cubes on black manganese ore. The larger crystals show, like rhpmbohedrons of brownspar, a peculiar curvature of the faces, as re corded of the sub-species of cube-ore \"Beudantite.\" On the smaller crj*stals, however, this feature is absent, and it would therefore appear to be a character, incident on the growth of the crystals beyond a certain size. Some of the smaller crystals also show hemihedral planes of the octahedron. Before the blow-pipe this cube-ore gives a small trace of manganese. It probably results from the decomposition of arsenical pyrites. 67a. Vivianite (in part \u2014 Phos- phate of Iron). Bruthen Creek, near Port Albert, Gippsland.

This ore occurs in mammillary crusts and concretions in the quartz reefs of all the goldfields. It also occupies, in some of the auriferous conglomerates, the place of the brown oxide of iron, in cementing the pebbles together, and sometimes contains embedded specks of gold. In quartz reefs it appears to be one of the most recently-formed minerals, as, wherever in contact, it forms coatings over most of the others (gold, quartz, chloro-bromide of silver, iron and arsenical pyrites, &c).

This is caused by the large quantity of nickel-ore, containing cobalt, that"], [86, "76 VICTORIAN MINERALS. CASE XIII. is brought to England from the Continent, and from which the cobalt is saved as a by-product. The demand for nickel, to be used in the manu facture of the basis of plated ware, is steadily increasing, while the demand for cobalt is daily diminishing, on account of the artificial blues introduced for the use of the dyer, calico-printer and papermaker. Still our cobalt-ore might be economically used \u2014 the saving being moderately easy, where it occurs in quartz reefs worked for gold, as at Alexandra diggings, where it coats the joints of the quartz with a botryoidal coat ing of considerable thickness \u2014 by passing the tailings through settling boxes, in which it would settle with the last of the gold, and be in an excellent form for removing gold from tailings by Plattner's chlorine process. The residue would also be of value for the generation of chlo rine in chemical works. After either of these operations the cobalt could be saved. A process has been invented and tried in South Australia, in which the cobalt is extracted by smelting the ore with copper and, I believe, separating the metallic cobalt by liquation; but I have not heard that it has been attended with success.\" 85.

The following remarks on Quartz are taken from \"Notes on the Physical Geography, Geology and Mineralogy of Victoria \" : \u2014 Quartz is, as the \"massive variety,\" the most common of colonial minerals, represented by the thousands of auriferous and non-auriferous reefs that traverse our Silurian rocks, and also as extensive beds of \"quartz rock,\" some nearly 40 feet in thickness, in the lower Miocene tertiary formation. It is partly, and perhaps more commonly, white opaque, or what might be called \" milky quartz,\" partly vitreous, semi translucent. Sometimes it shows, especially in veins traversing the granite, a greasy lustre \u2014 \"greasy quartz.\" Iu the Belltopper reef, Tara dale, it is quite sugary or fine granular ; in some of the St. ,Arrjauu' an(i Heathcote reefs cellular ; and iu most auriferous reefs there occur opaque patches of a uniform brown or yellow color \u2014 \"ferruginous quartz.\" Druses of crystals occur in all reefs, yet not in such abundance as in the European ore lodes. Fine, very perfect, opaque white crystals (double hexagonal pyramid with narrow planes of the prism) occur in an Elvan dyke on the Back Creek, near Dr. Baynton's station (\\ sheet 51 S.W. Map No. Mb 26. See specimen No. 50). In quartz veins traversing the granite, near Pigeon Hill, Tarrangower, specimens of the so-called \"Hauben\" or \"Hood quartz\" are occasionally found. Some peculiar crystals were discovered by Mr. Norman Taylor, of the Geo logical Survey, which exhibit in a striking manner their growth. (See specimens No. 43 and following note). Large and fine crystals of quartz enclosing \"actinolite,\" and accompanied by large and perfect crystals of felspar, were found in a bed of granite drift and clay, in the Coliban River, below Orr's station (Stratford Lodge). Quartz occurs also, though, generally speaking, only in moderate abundance, in a transparent crystallized slate, and in colored varieties, fine enough to be cut for jewellery. Thus we have Rock crystal, both as crystals of large size, sometimes rich in rare planes, and as pebbles ; the latter frequently found in the Older and Newer Pliocene gold drifts, though seldom of sufficient size to make them valuable. Curved and twin-like crystals are also frequent, and several have been found with filamental tufts of \" Chlorite \" in the centre. The varieties hitherto discovered in Victoria are : \u2014 1. Rock crystal. \u2014 Distinct crystals and waterworn pebbles. 2. Smoky Topaz and Cairngorm. \u2014 As pebbles in drifts, and in some quartz veins traversing granite. 3. Amethyst.\u2014 Occurs similarly to the last. 4. Prase. \u2014 Of rare occurrence. 5.

Note. \u2014 This mineral occurs very abundantly in the lowest basaltic flow immediately under the Falls. It bears a close resemblance to \" chalcedony,\" forming semi-transparent, botryoidal crusts and globular nobs of a bluish or yellowish white color ; whilst its fine concentric radiating structure, mostly accompanied by a change to a darker color, gives it the appearance of \" sph\u00e6rosiderite.\" The external surfaces are generally coated with a thin, brittle crust of bright-brown, glittering carbonate of iron, sometimes decomposed to yellow oxide. According to an analysis by Mr. J. C. Newbery it varies slightly in composition, according to color : the darker portions containing most iron and man ganese. An average specimen gave : \u2014 Carbonate of lime ... ... ... 72*43 \u201e iron ... ... ... 20*65 \u201e magnesia ... ... 500 manganese ... ... ... 1*92 100*00 Its hardness is 3*5 \u2014 sp. gr. 2*86. On comparing this composition with the minerals classed under \"Dolo mite,\" a very great difference will be observed, especially as regards lime and magnesia ; we have consequently thought it not unjustifiable to call this mineral \" Ferro-calcite.\" It is probable, that it represents a part-pseudomorph after \" sph\u00e6rosiderite,\" by exchange of carbonate of lime for carbonate of iron. 13.

ANALYSES. !. (Cl.; Granite. \u2014 The white and bluish felspars represent respectively orthoclase and oligoclase, the latter showing faint stria.. These are associated with common black mica and quartz. The analysis is of the mass, as the felspars could not be separated from each other. 2. (99.) Euritic Eock. \u2014 Consists of two felspars intermingled with quartz, so thoroughly mixed that a separate analysis of the felspars could not be made. One of them is striated ; the analysis shows it to be oligoclase. In some portions of the specimen black mica was found (vide Ko. 100), which would bring the rock into the class designated by G. Rose as granitite, and by Fournet as miarolite. 3. (18.) Felspar Porphyry. \u2014 The crystals rendering the mass porphyritic are yellow striated oligoclase and glassy non-striated orthoclase. The analysis of the matrix gives almost exactly the composition of oligoclase. Whether the small black specks which the rock occasionally contains are hornblende or schorl, which they most resemble, could not be determined, on account of their small quantity. 4. (49.) Serpentine. \u2014 The analysis of the mass clearly proves the rock to be serpentine, closely resembling the serpentine from the Radau Valley in the Hartz Mountains : the fracture, showing that the rock has a tendency to turn into schiller-spar, has also its black color and its association with chrysotile. 5. (64.) Greenstone (Diabase). \u2014 The analysis of the soluble and insoluble portions of this rock are given on page 17 of the Catalogue. The analysis in mass also tends to prove the com- position of the rock. From the appearance of the specimens of the rock it could not be clearly ascertained whether the greenish-black mineral associated witb the felspathic component was augite or hornblende. The analysis of the soluble portion proves it to be labradorite ; and as this species of felspar is always associated with augite, the rock should be called diabase. The greenish element of the mass is probably chlorite. 6. (67.) Felspar from Diorite. \u2014 The portion taken was perfectly separated from all matrix, and the analysis shows it to be albite. 7. (70a, 70b.) Epidosite. \u2014 The rock consists of quartz, epidote, and hornblende. The analysis 70a is of the rock with the hornblende separated, and resembles that given by Dr. Hunt of the epidosite of Canada. 70b was another portion, containing less free quartz ; it had a specific gravity of from 321 to 326, and taking the specific gravity of epidote as 'A'A, 19 per cent, of the silica may be deducted as quartz, which will leave SiO 41\u2014 Al O 25 \u2014 Fe O 19 \u2014 CaO 15, which is the composition of an iron epidote. 2 3 8. (50.) Older Basaltic Clay. \u2014 Color light brown ; 59 per cent, soluble in hydrochloric acid. The analysis is of the soluble portion. 9. (51.) Amygdaloidal Basaltic Clay. \u2014 A specimen closely resembling No. 51 gave the analysis; 59 per cent, was soluble in hydrochloric acid. 10. (56.) Red Basaltic Clay. \u2014 The analysis is from a specimen closely resembling No. 56; 58 per cent, was soluble in hydrochloric acid. The analysis is of the soluble portion. II. (fiOa-b.) The analysis is from a nodule which closely resembled the interior portions of No. 60 ; 49 per cent, was soluble in hydrochloric acid. 60a is the soluble portion, 6Ub the insoluble. 12. (6.) Newer Basaltic\u2014 Basalt (a) is the soluble portion, which is 24 per cent, of the whole ; (b) is the insoluble. 13. (30.)
