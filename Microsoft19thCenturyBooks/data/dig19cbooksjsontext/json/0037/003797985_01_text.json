Edward, the eldest, was a captain in the Fourth Regi ment of Life Guards; while Walter, after completing his education beneath the roof of the Revd. Thomas Wood, vicar of Lynburn, had entered the service of his country as clerk in the Foreign Office. There was another brother, John, who was on the point of taking orders ; while in addition to these arrows in his quiver, Sir Edward was blessed with five olive branches, in the shape of as many comely daughters. Walter, who was the youngest of the family, had entered his twenty-first year a few months before. For his eldest brother Walter felt a much warmer attachment than he did for any of the"], [11, "THE CARYLLS. 3 other members of his family. He loved his sisters, and they loved him ; but no great amount of sympathy existed between them. As a boy, he had been something of the enfant terrible, and was always hustled out of the way whenever any of their admirers were expected, for fear of untoward revelations. Nor did the scoldings innumerable, which he had received for tumbling their dresses, dis turbing the symmetry of their locks, promot ing breaches of the peace between the dog and the cat, with many other offences of the same nature, excite any pleasing recollections in his mind. They were now very good friends, all the better, perhaps, for his having passed but little of his time at home since the days of his boyhood. The two eldest were married, Lucy to Mr. Shoreham, a chancery barrister who was fast rising into excellent practice, and Fanny to Captain Marlowe, with whom she was now at the Cape. Of the three others, Maud, the youngest, was Walter's favourite ; at least it was with her that he corresponded. b 2"], [12, "4 THE CARYLLS. But of all his family his brother John was the one whom he liked the least, or, to speak honestly, whom he disliked the most. John, in his teens, was a decided bully, and fond of practical jokes ; and great was the persecution which Walter, in his childish days, had undergone at his hands, till rescued from it by Edward. That gallant officer, while at home on leave, had accidentally witnessed some outrageous act of tyranny perpetrated on his little brother, then about ten years of age, and in the height of his indignation in flicted very summary justice on the culprit, accompanied by an assurance that the dose would be repeated whenever required, even if he had to come to Caryll Holt for that pur pose without leave. Since that time Walter had been left in comparative peace ; but the love and gratitude which he felt for the brother who had protected him, and who was always giving him fresh proofs of his affec tion, grew with his growth, and strengthened with his strength, till it became a passion. John, on the other hand, never made the slightest attempt to regain the footing he had"], [13, "THE CARYLLS. 5 lost, unless, indeed, the lectures with which he now favoured Walter, as well as the other members of his family, not excepting his father, may be considered as such. It can scarcely be said that the objects of his solici tude derived much benefit from these exhorta tions. His father threw them on one side, merely observing that the reverend gentle man was evidently preparing for his duties as rector of the parish ; the others contented themselves with remarking that John had always been bent upon making himself as disagreeable as possible. But it is time to return to Epsom. The tone in which Captain Caryll spoke was indicative of the highest spirits and satis faction ; but his brother was far from answer ing him in the same key. \" I shall resist its attractions easily enough in future,\" he said. \" It is my first and last Derby ; I wish 1 had never heard the name.\" \" What is it, old fellow ?\" said Edward kindly, passing his arm through his brother's. \" Lost ! your money, eh? How much is it?\" he added, after a moment's pause for the"], [14, "6 THE CARYLLS. answer, which did not appear to be forth coming. \" Well, yes,\" his companion replied, at length, \"I have lost fifty pounds, and the worst of it is I have not fifty shillings till my next quarter. Poor Ph\u0153bus must go. By the-bye wdll you take him off my hands ? He will not make a bad charger, and I had so much rather sell him to you than to a stranger.\" \" No, thank you, master Wat. If Ph\u0153bus has the spirit I give him credit for, he would kick me over his head if he found me in your saddle. But make your mind easy about your loss ; I have won handsomely, and can well afford to help you out of this scrape.\" \" No, no ; take Ph\u0153bus, and I shall be quite satisfied. I know you have not more money than you know what to do with.\" \" You stupid boy, I tell you I have won a good stake \u2014 nine hundred pounds ! What do you think of that ? Will you refuse now, or do you mean to say that you would not do as much for me, if our positions were reversed?\" \" Oh ! no, dear Edward ; I accept your"], [15, "7 THE CARYLLS. offer most thankfully, but I had no idea you betted to such an extent.\" \" The extent is the same as yours \u2014 fifty pounds. I make two bets in the course of the year, one on the Derby, and one on the Leger, and as yet have no reason to complain of my speculations. On the present occasion I was particularly fortunate. I was at Savage's last Christmas, and he persuaded me to make my investment on his horse, which was quite in the background ; but the best of it is that I took tremendous odds about his winning the double event of the Derby and Leger, aud now I can hedge to my heart's content.\" \" I am sure you deserve it all,\" said Walter. \" How can I ever thank you \u2014 \" Captain Caryll interrupted him. ** In the first place, by saying no more about it ; and, in the next, by keeping out of such scrapes in future.

How on earth can a man be forced into making a bet ? To whom have you lost your money ?\" \" That fellow Leycester. We were both riding with Lady Mary Segrave, and the con versation fell upon the Derby. I said that I had no interest in it, and did not even think of going to Epsom. And then Leycester began chaffing me, and ended by offering to bet me the odds against the favourite, three to one in hundreds. I stood out for some time, but Lady Mary told me to take it, and that she would go halves. Of course I could not refuse, and she brought me down in her carriage with Leycester and a cousin of his, a Miss Beatrice Leycester, a very pretty, agreeable girl, though rather fast, I suspect.\" \" Oh that was the way of it, was it ?\" said the Captain. \" It's one hundred you will want then, instead of fifty.\" \" No ; I told you Lady Mary stands half.\" \" My dear Walter, depend upon it, like"], [17, "9 THE CARYLLS. most women, Lady Mary never contemplated the possibility of losing, and I shall be greatly surprised if her fifty pounds are forthcoming.\" This view of the case seemed to be any thing but satisfactory to Mr. Walter Caryll. He grew very red in the face while his brother was speaking, and, when he had concluded, exclaimed with a vehemence which made some of the passers-by turn round and look at him, \" But there were lots of fellows heard it ; I am certain Leycester understands it as T do.\" \" Hush, my dear fellow,\" said Captain Caryll ; \" there can be no necessity for your taking all the world into your confidence. As for Leycester, depend upon it he is a great deal too knowing, and is too well acquainted with Lady Mary's circumstances to think of making a bet with her. It is notorious that she has a very small jointure, and is always in difficulties. It was with you alone he made the bet, and it is to you alone he will look for the payment.\" \" I can never believe she would play me such a trick as that,\" said Walter. \" If I did b 5"], [18, "10 THE CARYLLS. I should certainly find some means of letting her know that I expect her to stand to her bargain ; for after all, it is entirely owing to her that I have made such a fool of myself.\" \" Very likely, and you may thank your stars it is no worse. But you must not mis understand me. My observations only applied to Lady Mary's probable inability to meet her engagement now. I have no doubt she would pay if she could, and will when she can, for, though thoughtless, I never heard her accused of anything dishonourable. And put this well into your head ; no gentleman can ask a lady for money, or even hint to her that she is his debtor. But enough lecturing. Come to me to-morrow, and you shall have the money you require ; so smoothe your ruffled plumes as fast as you can.\" Again Walter tried to express his gratitude, but his brother cut him short. \" Do you think,\" he said, \" I could feel any pleasure in my success if you were a loser by it ! And that puts me in mind, you must help me to choose something for the girls. I mean you all to be participators in my good"], [19, "11 THE CARYLLS. fortune. I will send John a silk gown to preach his first sermon in.\" \" And you may expect in return a homily on the sinfulness of gambling and racing,\" said Walter. \"He will only take advantage of your good nature to improve the occasion.\" \" Possibly. If his discourse is a good one I will print it and publish it. But it is time to think of getting something to eat. Where do you mean to lunch ?

Come, make a clean breast of it.\" \" No. It is a joint concern altogether ; Leycester and his cousin pay for the post horses ; Lady Mary finds the luncheon, and I find the wine.\" \" Then by Jove, I will go too ; her lady ship cannot refuse me a biscuit and a glass of wine, if only for the sake of auld lang syne.\" \" Do you know her ? I have never seen you there.\" \" Quite well enough for that. I have not seen much of her of late years, but when her father was alive aud living at the Chase, we used to meet perpetually as children. That was before your time. Afterwards, while she was still Lady Mary Oakley, I saw a great deal of her in London and, to confess the truth, fell over head and ears in love with her. In fact, I had made up my mind to propose to her, when Segrave stepped in with his twenty thousand a-year, and my chance was gone. We always met, however, on friendly terms, for nothing explicit had ever passed between"], [21, "13 THE CARYLLS. us, and I had no right to complain of her conduct. I have no doubt she yielded to her aunt's influence, with whom she lived after the death of her father and mother. Old Lady Barbara could not bear me, and she was a woman who in worldly wisdom might have given a lesson to the devil himself. My only object in what I said of Lady Mary was to caution you against being led into any further act of imprudence. After all, if she does sin a little in the way of extravagance, she is perhaps more to be pitied than blamed. For the six years of her married life she had every luxury at her command and the disposal of a large income, for Segrave was a most indulgent husband, when by his sudden death she found herself in very narrow circumstances, for, not having a child, almost all Segrave's pro perty went to his nephew, who does not love her.\" \" Had she no fortune of her own ?\" \" Her father, the late Lord Isleworth, left nothing but debts, and the landed property passed with the title to his cousin, the present man. I believe there was some small sum,"], [22, "14 THE CARYLLS. ten or twelve thousand pounds, settled on her, but so tied up that she can only touch the interest ; luckily for her, I should say.\" By this time they were close to the carriage of the lady in question, round which were congregated several hungry mortals, who had already made considerable inroads on the good things in the hamper. However, enough was left for the new comers, who received a cordial invitation to join the party, although a slight shade of embarrassment passed over the lady's brow when her eyes first fell on Captain Caryll. \" Oli, Mr. Caryll,\" she exclaimed, \" I am ashamed to look you in the face, when I think that it was under my auspices you made that unlucky bet. Can you ever forgive me?\" \" Dear Lady Mary, the only thing I do not feel inclined to forgive is your asking me such a question.\" \"There's a pretty speech for you, Lady Mary,\" said Mr. Leycester, with a provoking sneer. \" Is that your own, Walter, or did you pick it out of Sh- Charles Grandison?\""], [23, "THE CARYLLS. 15 The two were sufficiently intimate ; but no great amount of good-will existed between them. Mr. Leycester, who was a cousin of Lady Mary's, and a few years Walter's senior, was disposed to be overbearing and sarcastic, and on the present occasion was a little out of temper. Notwithstanding the bet he had won of Caryll, he was on the whole a loser; not much certainly, but, though rich, he had a great objection to losing at all. \" Quite my own,\" replied Walter, \" and if ever you should so far forget yourself as to wish to make a civil speech, I will lend it you. Tou will never be able to invent one for yourself.\" \" Hear, hear ; you never spoke a truer word, Mr. Caryll,\" said Miss Leycester, with a laugh, in which more than one of those present joined. \" If I cannot invent civil speeches,\" began Mr. Leycester, angrily, but Lady Mary hastily interposed \u2014 \" At all events,\" she said, \" I am sure Mr. Caryll's speech has the merit of being sincere."], [24, "16 THE CARYLLS. I hope, Captain Caryll, you have been more fortunate in your speculations than we have. \" Oh, my speculations are generally on a very small scale, but I have no reason to complain on the present occasion. I must, however, wish you good morning now, or I shall miss my party.\" \"Will you dine with me to-day?\" said Lady Mary. \" You will only meet your brother, Mr. Leycester, and Beatrice, who is staying with me.\" \" Thank you, I am engaged.\" \" Do you not mean to say something to me before you go, Captain Caryll ?\" said Miss Beatrice. Captain Caryll looked at her with some surprise. \" I was not aware,\" he replied, \" that I had the honour of your acquaintance. If I have, forgive my stupidity.\" \" I know nothing about the honour of my acquaintance, but I do know that you had the honour of picking me up and putting me into my saddle, when I got a fall last winter with the B \u2014 hounds.\" 14 Of course I remember it,\" said Edward,"], [25, "THE CARYLLS. 17 \" but I had no idea you were the lady in question. Pray attribute my forgetfulness to its right cause\u2014the difference of your costume. I trust you experienced no bad effects from your fall.\" \" None at all. Tout au contraire, as a Frenchman would say. I remembered you at once; but then I had reason to do so. Fancy, Mary, Captain Caryll was first over the fence, well abreast of the leading hounds, which were just getting on excellent terms with their fox, and as soon as he heard the crash behind him, he pulled up at once, and came to my assistance, losing of course the rest of the run. I do not believe one man in a hundred would have done as much.\" \" Well, Bee,\" said Mr. Leycester, \" I will do you the justice to say that you are better up in sporting slang than any girl I know. I wonder you are not a little ashamed of parading your hunting feats, when you do get into civilized society.\" \" So I should be,\" she retorted, \" if I was such a muff 'cross country as you are.\" Captain Caryll's departure seemed to give"], [26, "18 THE CARYLLS. the signal for a general move. The horses were put to Lady Mary's carriage, and, attended by her attaches, she reached her own house in safety, after running the gauntlet of the amenities of the road. It cannot be said that the dinner was a very lively one, although the ladies exerted themselves to the utmost. Mr. Leycester was decidedly sulky, and Walter was unusually reserved and taciturn. The latter took his departure at an early hour, pleading a headache, an excuse which found but little credence with his companions. \" I wonder what takes Walter away so early,\" observed Lady Mary. \" Gone to rnedihite on ways and means,\" replied Mr. Leycester. \" Ways and means ! What can you mean ! \" I mean that when a man loses his year's income on a race, he sometimes finds it troublesome to pay his bets. However, I am not uneasy. I will take that horse of his off his hands, if he likes, and cry quits.\" \" Take poor Ph\u0153bus ! But he only loses fifty pounds after all, for half the bet was mine.\""], [27, "THE CARYLLS. 19 \" Was it ? But I have nothing to do with your arrangements with Walter Caryll. All I know is that he owes me a hundred pounds.\" \" But surely you must be mistaken ; about his income I mean. I thought Walter was rich. Did not an uncle, or somebody, leave him a large fortune ?\" \" No ; that was another Walter Caryll, a distant cousin I believe. As for our man, I do not suppose he has more than a couple of hundred a year besides his salary, for his father is a poor man with a large family, and he is the youngest son.\" \" But good gracious, he lives as if he had plenty of money at his command.\" \" Most young men do for a year or two on first coming to London.\" \" And knowing all this,\" said Lady Mary, indignantly, \" you had no mercy on him. You led him on to risk what you knew would distress him to pay.\" \" In the first place,\" replied Leycester, \" honour where honour is due ; I much doubt whether he would have accepted the bet at"], [28, "20 THE CARYLLS. all, had not your ladyship joined your per suasive voice to mine. In the next, if he has a spark of gratitude, he ought to feel very much obliged to me for giving him so in structive a lesson. And lastly,\" continued he, rising to depart, \"as I have never yet met with anyone who had mercy on me, 1 do not profess to have mercy on others. In this world it is diamond cut diamond, or a softer stone if we can find it. Let us hope that in the next we shall all be more tender hearted.\" \" I wonder,\" said Miss Leycester, as soon as the door had closed on him, \" if it is a wicked thing to hate one's cousin ; if so, I am in a bad way. I think John without excep tion the most selfish and heartless snob I ever came across. Did you ever hear that he wanted to chisel me out of my poor twenty thousand pounds ?\" \" Snob and chisel ! My dear Bee, where on earth do you pick up such words ? What ever his shortcomings, John was right in inveighing against your slang expressions. They sound especially ill, coming from you,"], [29, "THE CARYLLS. 21 for they are anything but ladylike, and you are.\" \" Thank you, my lady,\" replied Miss Leycester, making a low curtsey. \"But I can speak English, when put to it. At the same time, I confess I like to use words which express my meaning clearly. But, dear Mary, what is to be done about that poor boy ? Do you think he would mind my offering to lend him a hundred pounds?\" \" You are a dear, good girl, notwithstand ing your imperfections of language, but this is quite out of the question. I have no doubt his brother will assist him if he requires it. So now let us say good night, for I am tired.\""], [30, "22 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER II. It certainly was not to meditate on ways and means that Walter betook himself to his lodging at so early an hour, but he had ample subject for reflection. He was not the least in love with Lady Mary, who was many years older than himself, but he had been so much in the habit of dawdling away his time in her house for the last year or two, and attaching himself to her footsteps wherever she went, that a sort of platonic attachment for her had sprung up in his breast, which the evident goodwill with which she regarded him had, no doubt, greatly contributed to foster. It is true she treated him with very little ceremony, calling him Walter, and sending him upon all her miscellaneous errands without scruple, but she did it all in such a natural, friendly way, that he looked upon every fresh com mission confided to him as a mark of dis-"], [31, "23 THE CARYLLS. tinguished favour. Nor could he perceive, although she had no lack of admirers, that any of them stood higher in her favour than himself; as long as this was the case he was quite content to keep in the background, and to rest satisfied with the crumbs that fell from her table. But this complacent frame of mind had been somewhat disturbed by his brother's revela tions. It almost looked as if he had been merely made use of as a sort of cat's paw, and in all probability he was so regarded by Lady Mary's intimates. Perhaps at that very moment Mr. Leycester was making merry over his discomfiture, and amusing Lady Mary and Miss Beatrice by all sorts of jokes and face tious observations at his expense. Leycester he had never liked. That gentleman's father had been the squire and great man of the parish of Lynburn, where Walter hadreceived his education, and where the two had first be come acquainted. Old Mr. Leycester had been dead a little more than two years, and his son had already contrived to make himself exceed ingly unpopular in the county by theimperti-"], [32, "24 THE CARYLLS. nence with which he rejected the civilities of the neighbouring gentry and his oppressive conduct to his dependents. Also, it was sup posed that Mr. John Leycester had contrived to appropriate the affections of Miss Annie Wood, whose good graces Walter had been disposed to cultivate, while residing beneath her father's roof. All these reasons combined had inspired Walter with anything but ami able feelings towards him, when he met him again in London, but fate seemed determined to bring them together ; for it so happened that they were intimate in the same houses, particularly at Lady Mary Segrave's, where they frequently met ; hitherto, Walter had flattered himself, on terms of perfect equality as regarded the favour of the divinity of the temple whom they both strove to propitiate ; or, if the balance did slightly incline to one side, it was to his. Now his memory fur nished him with many circumstances which seemed to throw considerable doubt upon this fancied impartiality. On the gentleman's part, at all events, there was at times a fami liarity of manner in his intercourse with Lady"], [33, "THE CARYLLS. 25 Mary which, to say the least, was very sus picious. Before Walter had divested himself of his boots his feelings for Leycester amounted to aversion. But as regarded Lady Mary Segrave, the real author of his misfortune, the case was far different. He could not bear, even in thought, to cast on her the slightest imputa tion of censure ; it is so difficult to break the idol to which one has been in the habit of offering incense morning, noon, and night! Moreover, he owed Lady Mary no trifling debt of gratitude. On his first coming to London he had been presented to her by her own desire ; she had taken him by the hand, and by every means in her power facilitated his success in society. In short, as she was trhs ripandue and very popular, she had been of great use to him, obtaining for him invita tions to some of the best houses in London, for which, without her aid. he might have sighed in vain, and introducing him to all his most agreeable partners. Then he recollected his brother's words, \" That perhaps she was VOL. I. i/ 0"], [34, "26 THE CARYLLS. more to be pitied than blamed,\" and he fully concurred in their justice. Sbe might be a dangerous guide fora young man, but now he had received a sufficient warning ; if he allowed her to betray him into any further indiscretions it would be his own fault. One point there was in Captain Caryll's disclosures which long occupied his thoughts before he fell asleep, and puzzled him not a little. This was the exact state of the rela tions which had existed between his brother and Lady Mary Segrave before her marriage. He could not help suspecting from his brother's manner that they had been of a closer nature than he was willing to avow, that, if they had entered into no positive en gagement, at least some sort of understanding had existed between them. And then he re called fragments of a whispering conversa tion which he had once overheard between his sisters with reference to the probability of Edward's marrying, in the course of which Louisa had expressed her conviction that, after the lesson he had received, it would be"], [35, "THE CARYLLS. 27 long before he thought of such a step. Could tbis refer to Lady Mary ! He fell asleep before he could solve this knotty point, and notwithstanding all his tribulations did not awake till a late hour. As soon as he had breakfasted he called upon his brother at the hotel in which he had in stalled himself, and found, to his great vexa tion, that he had missed that gentleman by a few minutes. A note, however, was put into his hands, which contained within it the germ of -consolation : \u2014 \"Dear Wat,\" it said, \"you are so late I can wait for you no longer. Inclosed is a cheque for \u00a3120, which will pay for your wine as well as your bet to Leycester. I shall be at home this evening, and if you have nothing to do, come and smoke a weed with me after dinner. \u2014 Yours, affectionately, E. C.\" Walter proceeded first to get his cheque cashed, and then, mindful of the duties he owed the British public, he betook himself to his office. Here he whiled away two or three c 2"], [36, "28 THE CARYLLS. hours in reading the papers, crunching a few biscuits, gossiping with his brother-clerks, and sketching caricatures, in which branch of artistic science he was rather an adept ; while one of his companions aided the efforts of his pen by furnishing appropriate epigrams. At four o'clock he prepared to leave the scene of his labours, when just as he was on the eve of departure a note from Lady Mary Segrave, requesting him to call upon her as soon as he was at liberty, was put in his hands. \" What a bore !\" he said to himself. \" She wants to tell me that she cannot pay her share of the bet, I suppose. I wish she would ignore it altogether. It would be all the same in the long run, and would be much pleasanter now.\" However, there was no help for it, and the sooner it was over the better. He jumped into a Hansom, and before long was deposited at Lady Mary's door. \" How good of you to come so soon,\" said her ladyship. \" I shall not lose my drive after all.\""], [37, "29 THE CARYLLS. Her manner was so cordial that Walter fell under the charm at once. \" It is most fortunate,\" he said, \" your note came when it did. Five minutes later it would not have found me at the office.\" \" Poor fellow, how hard you are worked ! But it was not to speak of your official duties that I sent for you. I do not know on what day you will have to settle your bets, and I wished to give you at once what 1 owe.\" As she spoke she held out some bank notes to him. Walter was so surprised by this unexpected result of his interview that for a moment he was silent. \" Oh, Lady Mary,\" he said at length, \" it is quite unnecessary to be in such a hurry. I shall not have to pay till Monday.\" \"And, Walter,\" she continued, \"if you should not be quite prepared with the re mainder, let me advance it to you. I have it there in my desk. Make me your creditor, instead of having recourse to Mr. Leycester's forbearance.\" \" Dear Lady Mary, how can I ever thank"], [38, "30 THE CARYLLS. you as I ought for your thoughtful kindness. I certainly should not like to throw myself on Leycester's mercy, but fortunately I have the money ready. Edward gave it me this morning.\" \" If that is the case,\" she said, \" I will say nothing more about it, though perhaps in strict justice I ought to pay it all, as I fear I was the cause of your betting at all. But to tell you the truth I have been under a great mistake all this time. I fancied you were the rich Mr. Walter Caryll, and now I am told it is not you, but your cousin.\" \" Too true,\" said Walter, laughing. \"He belongs to the lucky branch of the Carylls ; I to the unlucky one.\" \" Then, dear Walter, promise me never to make another bet. I should not easily forgive myself if I thought that I had been the means of giving you a taste for gambling.\" \" There is no danger of that, and I promise you never to risk more than five pounds at a time. I do not like to tie myself up alto gether.\" The conversation lasted a little longer, Lady"], [39, "THE CARYLLS. 31 Mary inveighing strongly against all extra vagance, and the pernicious consequences of running in debt. She even hinted at the ex pediency of selling his horse, till Walter assured her that Ph\u0153bus cost him nothing, being kept for him at his brother's expense. At last she dismissed him, as the carriage was at the door, and she had several visits to pay. Walter returned to his lodgings in a state of enchantment, wondering how he could ever for a moment have been induced to doubt her good faith, and in an agony of impatience to prove to his brother how unfounded his suspicions had been. He dispatched his dinner with unexampled celerity, and then rushed out to seek Captain Caryll at his hotel. Edward, however, had not yet returned, and half an hour elapsed before he made his ap pearance, which Walter employed in disposing five ten pound notes in the most symmetrical form on the table. \" You are a nice fellow, Master Wat,\" said Captain Caryll, as he entered. \" Half an hour too late in the morning, and half an hour too soon in the evening. Hallo, what is this ?"], [40, "32 THE CARYLLS. Have you been holding a rouge and noir bank against yourself?\" \" Down on your knees, Edward,\" exclaimed Walter; \" down on your knees, and ask pardon of heaven for having doubted that angel.\" \" Before I do you must explain yourself a little more clearly.\" Walter then narrated to him all that had passed between himself and Lady Mary, to which Captain Caryll listened with the most profound attention. When the tale was con\u00ab eluded he was silent for a short space, and then said, as if to himself, \" I was right, then, after all.\" \" What do you mean ?\" asked Walter. \" In what were you right?\" \" AV alter,\" said his brother, \" if I tell you my suspicions it is in strict confidence, and you must never breathe them to living being.

She was, however, too well wrapt up and had too thick a veil on for me to identify her with any degree of certainty, and the idea that it could be Lady Mary Se grave seemed so absurd that I did not give it a second thought, but I am now convinced that my first impression was correct.\" \"God forbid 1\" exclaimed Walter. \" It would make me miserable to think that she had submitted to such degradation on my account.\" \" And I rejoice at it. It was a generous and noble act. I have not a doubt that she told you the truth when she said that she believed you to be one to whom the loss of a hundred pounds was a matter of no conse- quence, and then, when she found out her mistake, she lost no time in saving you from the consequences of her thoughtlessness, at the price of her own humiliation ; for it must have been a bitter pill for her to swallow.

Why this difference, let the world explain if it can. But this she risked, and in so doing showed as much courage as good feeling. Do not wish it undone, for, in my eyes at least, it goes far to redeem many of her follies.\" \" Do you love her still, Edward?\" asked Walter, abruptly. \" No,\" he replied, without any embarrass ment, \" but I wish to esteem her.\" \" Yes,\" said Walter, \" you are right. It was a generous and noble act, and yet some how I cannot help hoping that you are mis taken. It jars upon my feelings.\" \" I have no doubt of the fact myself,\" re plied his brother, \"but before long I will ascertain it.

When Lady Mary pledged her diamonds she placed herself on a level with the beggar who pledges her gown to buy her children bread, or what difference there is is all in favour of the beggar. It ought to be a lesson to her, and I believe \u2014 I trust, she will have the good sense to profit by it.\" \" Oh, Edward, how can you make such a comparison ; Lady Mary Segrave and a beggar woman ! If you forget it, I do not, that what she did was to save me from pro bable embarrassment.\" Captain Caryll had something of the Me lancholy Jaques in his composition, and with out paying attention to his brother's exclam ation, he continued dreamily, as if following his own train of thought, \" Higher than Lady Mary Segrave have been brought lower. I have often before my eyes the two greatest examples of fallen greatness with which modern history furnishes us. The first is"], [44, "36 THE CARYLLS. Marie Antoinette, who, during the last months of her martyrdom, must have suffered more than any other woman on earth, save one. I declare, when I think of her in the Temple mending and patching her daughter's clothes, I can scarcely refrain from tears. Who can doubt that, purified by such suffering, borne with such patience and resignation, the gates of heaven opened to receive her, and then I ask myself, would that have been the case had she died in the royal apartments at Ver sailles? My other example is Mary, Queen of Scots, whom in the present day, when misfortune is a crime, and success alone is accepted as the proof of merit, it seems to be the fashion to run down. And yet, compare her dying scene with that of her persecutor, whose life was one continued series of triumphs and prosperity, and say who was most to be envied \u2014 she who died on the scaf fold, insulted to the last by the minions of her rival, but with words of forgiveness on her lips and hopes of pardon in her heart, or she whose death-bed was a scene of despair, surrounded by the spectres which conscience"], [45, "THE CARYLLS. 37 had conjured up around her ! No ; depend upon it a touGh of adversity now and then does us no harm.\" If Walter was rather bored by his brother's moralizing, he gave no further sign of it than by endeavouring to turn the conversation into another channel. \" Oh, I always hated Elizabeth,\" he said, \" but just put those bank notes out of sight ; I cannot bear to look at them.\" \" My dear Wat, the notes are yours, so if you dislike looking at them, put them into your pocket.\" \" No, no, Edward ; you have already done too much. I could not think of taking from you more than I absolutely require.\" \" Nonsense. Remember I am command ing officer here, and do as I tell you. I always meant to give you a hundred out of my win nings. And now ring the bell. Let us make ourselves comfortable with a cigar and some coffee, or brandy and water, if you like it better. By-the-bye, I forgot to tell you that Maud desired me to remind you that you owe her a letter.\""], [46, "38 THE CARYLLS. \" That's the old story. I have no chance with her, for she either keeps, or pretends to keep, a register of all letters written and re ceived ; however, this time I believe she is right. How did you leave them all ?\" \" Much as usual. I thought my father's manner more cheerful.\" \" Adversity has done him no good, at all events,\" remarked Walter; \"since our mother's death he has never held up his head.\" \" No ; it was the heaviest stroke fate could inflict on him \u2014 on all of us, perhaps ; but who can say it has been of no use to him ? though perhaps few men required it less.

And not I alone ; all who know him speak of him with affection and regard. While I was at home he received, I think, the highest compliment ever paid to any one.

Of course, my father declined, but I think it did him more good than anything that has happened for a long time.\" \" It is, indeed, a thing for any man to be proud of,\" said Walter; \" better than twenty testimonials of cups and shields. I hope Brentford will win, for I like him, though I wish he was not so much with Leycester.\" \" They are connected, not very nearly I believe, but Leycester's grandmother was an Oakley, and this makes him also a second or third cousin of Lady Mary Segrave's.

On this occasion, however, I asked him if he had any objec tion, and he said he thought it a very proper compliment, adding that, when he gave me my qualification, he had no idea of interfering with the way in which I should exercise it.\" At this moment Sir Henry Savage was an nounced ; he was an intimate friend of Cap tain Caryll, but as yet was unacquainted with his brother. \" Savage,\" said Edward, \" let me introduce my youngest brother, Walter, to you, the most promising scion ofthe Carylls.\" \" I am delighted to make his acquaintance, and have no doubt he will redeem his promises as well as you have done.\" \" Merci du compliment.

I have half a mind to retract my compliment; or is it modesty that prevents your attributing my presence to a wish to enjoy your society?

I hope you are satisfied with your day's work.\" \" Pretty well, I thank you ; I believe I shall clear upwards of thirty thousand. I hope you were in our boat, Mr. Caryll ?\" \" No, I am sorry to say,\" replied Walter; \" I lost a trifle.'' \" Sorry to hear it, for I was about to pro pose the Don's health.\" \" I shall be delighted to drink it, for, though I lost by him, I am glad for more reasons than one that he was the winner.\" \" Well, at all events you know how to lose with a good grace, which is more than can be said of everyone.

He thinks it an imputation on his judg ment.\" \" Edward,\" said Sir Henry, \" of course you will come with me to the Oaks to-morrow; I have kept the box seat on my drag for you.\" \" Can't, I am sorry to say. Lorraine wants to go, and I have promised to take his guard for him.\" \"What a bore; I quite reckoned on you! Mr. Caryll, as your brother cannot go, will you take his place ?\" But Walter also declined ; he said he had already been taking too many liberties with his office, and had received an intimation that he must be more regular in his attendance in future. \" What humbugs those heads of public offices are!\" said Sir Henry; \"as if there ever was anything to do that could not just as well be done a week or a month hence. However, I shall go down to the club, and see if I can pick up a passenger. Good night.\""], [51, "THE CARYLLS. 43 CHAPTER III. Captain Caryll was, to say the least of it, quite as anxious as his brother could possibly be to clear up the mystery respecting Lady Mary, and for that purpose he determined to apply at the fountain head. As soon as he had got rid of his guard, he presented himself at Lady Mary's door, and, though it was rather an early hour for a morning visit, found no difficulty in obtaining admittance ; he was shown into the drawing-room, and was assured that her ladyship would be down in a few minutes. It was the first time he had ever set foot in her house, and with very natural curiosity, he began to examine the various knicknacks which were lying about in every direction. Some there were with which he could claim acquaintance, and he held in his hand a copy of the \" Lays of An cient Rome,\" which he had himself presented"], [52, "44 THE CARYLLS. to the owner on one of her birthdays, when the door opened, and Lady Mary herself en tered, exclaiming \u2014 \" Oh ! Walter, I am so sorry to have kept you waiting, but \u2014 Captain Caryll ! \" she continued, as Edward turned round, and ad vanced to meet her. \" They told me it was Mr. Caryll, and I concluded \u2014 \" \" That it was my brother,\" said Edward, interrupting her. \" But I hope that does not mean that I am an unwelcome visitor.\" \" Oh, no, you cannot think that ; though it is the first visit you have ever paid me, I hope it will not be the last.\" \" Lady Mary,\" he said, going to the point at once, \" I am sure you will not attribute my question to impertinent curiosity, but will you allow me to ask you if you were in Wardour street two days ago ?\" \" In Wardour street ! No.\" Then suddenly recollecting herself, a burning blush covered her face and brow. \" Good God !\" she said, faintly, \" what is it you mean?\" \" I mean that, if what I suspect is true, you have established a claim on my esteem,"], [53, "THE CARYLLS. 45 and I may say on my gratitude, which nothing can ever efface. Am I not right in suppos ing that the object of your visit to Wardour Street was to borrow the money you gave my brother? that to save him from embarrass ment and possible disgrace, you sacrificed yourself?\" But, however friendly the words \u2014 however full of sympathy the tone in which they were expressed, they failed in bringing any con solation with them. Lady Mary had hid her face in her hands, and could only murmur out \u2014 \" This, indeed, is a humiliation for which I was not prepared.\" \" Do not, I entreat of you, talk of humilia- tion,\" said Captain Caryll, \" for an action wliich would secure for you the regard of every man of right feeling.\" Then seeing the tears which flowed down her cheeks, he took one of her hands, and continued, \" Mary, though we can never be to each other what we once were, look upon me as a friend. You cannot doubt the interest I feel in your welfare ; let me be to you as a brother.\""], [54, "46 THE CARYLLS. \"Ah, would to God I had always had a brother like you !\" was her passionate reply, accompanied by a fresh burst of tears. \" Well, then,\" he said, cheerfully, \" accept my offer now. ' Better late than never ' is not a bad proverb.\" \" I do \u2014 I do,\" she exclaimed, \" most thank fully, most gratefully.\" \" That being settled then, the first thing to be considered is what is to be done about this loan you have contracted, for of course, it is impossible to leave your goods and chat tels where they are.\" \"They must remain where they are for another month or six weeks ; till I receive my money in July.\" \" Quite out of the question ; you must let me be your banker. Hear me out,\" he con tinued, seeing her open her lips to speak. \" I can do it without the slightest inconvenience, and if it will put your mind at ease, you shall pay me interest for it; how much is it, and what are the articles on which you raised it?\" \" Indeed, Captain Caryll, I cannot accept"], [55, "THE CARYLLS, 47 your generous offer ; I know you are not rich, and I could not hear of your suffering for my folly.\" \" Lady Mary, on tbis I must insist, unless you wish me to feel that our friendship is a mere word. If you lost on the Derby, I won ; besides, I mean to make money of you ; so how much is it ?\" \" I borrowed two hundred pounds, for be sides Walter's money, I owe Mr. Leycester a hundred, which he lent me some time ago. But that can wait ; and I have still fifty more in my desk, so that if you really can, without inconvenience, lend me fifty pounds \u2014 \" \" My dear Lady Mary, you must pay Leycester at once. He is the last man in the world to whom I should wish any friend of mine to be indebted. I can lend you two hundred pounds as easily as fifty. You shall repay me half in July and the other half in January ; that is to say if this arrangement suits you.\" She tried to make some further objections, but only succeeded in making Edward take the fifty, for which she averred she had no use."], [56, "48 THE CARYLLS. \" And now,\" he said, \" you must give me the document which will enable me to restore your property to you.\" It was with fresh reluctance and a fresh feeling of shame that she put into his hands the pawnbroker's ticket, which stated that a diamond necklace and earrings had been pledged for two hundred pounds by Anne Carey, of Wimpole-street, Anne Carey being, as she explained, the name of her maid's mother. \" Good Heavens, what a risk you ran ! Suppose the pawnbroker had taken it into his head that Anne Carey could not be the legiti mate possessor of jewels of such value ! Oh ! Lady Mary, promise me that you will never again have recourse to such expedients. Try to keep out of debt ; it is the advice of one who wishes you well.\" \" Yes,\" she replied, \" this will indeed be a lesson to me, but in the present case I had no other resource. And you must not think I am in debt; I am only behindhand.\" \" How so ? I do not understand you.\" \" I mean that when I receive my income I"], [57, "THE CARYLLS. 49 pay all I owe, and this leaves me very little to go on with. But when my poor aunt dies the money my grandmother left her comes to me. It is not a great deal, but it will put me quite at my ease, for I am not extravagant, whatever people may think.\" \" Where is your aunt now ?\" \" At Leamington. She and Colonel Segrave did not get on very well together, and I have seen very little of her since my marriage.\" \"Now, Lady Mary, before I go write to Leycester, and enclose him a cheque for the money you owe him. I shall not be happy till I know you are out of his hands. Give me a hundred pounds, and I will pay it into your banker's on my way home.\" She did as he told her, and then he prepared to take his departure. \" You will come and see me again before long?\" she said. \" Certainly. To-morrow most probably, as I shall have to restore your diamonds to you. I should not like to have them in my lodgings for long.\" VOL. I. d"], [58, "50 THE CARYLLS. She held out her hand to him. \" If I have not expressed all I feel for your more than kindness, believe me it is because the words are wanting, not the will.\" \" Pray say no more on that head. I have now a sixth sister, and I have done no more for you than I would have done for any of the other five. Indeed, I ought rather to ask your forgiveness for having broached the sub ject at all. You are the only woman with whom I should have ventured to take such a liberty, but I felt sure you would do justice to my motives.\" Captain Caryll was perfectly successful in his mission, though he was not a little dis composed when the pawnbroker remarked that he had not supposed that the diamonds would remain with him long. Mr. Leycester also received his cheque, but not with much satis faction, for though he liked money, he liked power more, and he had derived considerable pleasure from the thought that a young and handsome woman had laid herself under an obligation to him, from which he fancied she would find some difficulty in freeing herself."], [59, "51 THE CARYLLS. Moreover he was convinced there was some mystery in the whole transaction, which he puzzled himself in vain to unravel. His father had been one of Lady Mary's trustees, and he was perfectly well acquainted with the state of her affairs. \" Well, Master Walter,\" said he, when the two met at Tattersall's for the purpose of settling their accounts, \" I hope my lady has paid you her share of the bet. If not you had better dun her, for she is flush just now. She has paid me a hundred she owed me, and which, between ourselves, I never ex pected to see again.\" Captain Caryll had taken his brother into his confidence so far as to tell him that he had suggested to Lady Mary a better and more respectable way of raising the money she re quired than by pledging her jewels. On this score, therefore, Walter was quite at ease, and contrived to suppress the indignation he felt at hearing the irreverent manner in which Mr. Leycester spoke of his goddess. \" My lady 1\" he exclaimed, in the most d 2"], [60, "52 THE CARYLLS. natural manner, which did great credit to his nascent diplomatic talent. \" Oh, you mean Lady Mary Segrave. Yes, she gave me fifty pounds the day after the race.\" \" Where the deuce could she have got all that money from ? Spouted her diamonds, I suppose.\" \" Hardly, for she had them on at D. House. By the same token, that as there was a great crowd, a regular mob round the door, she took off her earrings while we were waiting on the stairs for her carriage, and gave them to me to take care of for her, for fear they might be snatched from her as she was pass ing out. I gave them back to her safe and sound half-an-hour ago, before I came here.\" \" Well, I cannot make it out,\" said Ley cester ; \" but I vow I will find it out, if I have to ask her myself.\" And to this expedient he was driven, urg ing his enquiries with such offensive pertina city that at last Mary found herself obliged to cut the matter short. \" Cousin John,\" she said, \" in obedience to the precepts of your respected great aunt, my"], [61, "53 THE CARYLLS. grandmother, I make it a rule never to an swer impertinent questions.\" Mr. Leycester bit his lips, but he did not think it expedient to pursue the discussion any further. Probably he thought he had been a little too far as it was, for he said with great apparent bonhommie \u2014 \" Well, I hope if ever you require any as sistance of a similar nature again you will apply to me. In that, as in everything else, I am quite at your orders.\" \" Thank you,\" she said, accepting the im plied apology ; \" but I hope I shall keep clear of all embarrassments for the future.\" They parted to all appearance on their usual friendly terms, but both felt that it was in appearance only. Their alliance, which had never been a very cordial one, was vir tually dissolved, much to the relief of the lady it must be admitted, who had long been weary of it, and latterly had submitted to it simply because she did not know how to withdraw from it without giving offence, and it is rather awkward to offend a man to whom one owes money."], [62, "54 THE CARYLLS. His place was soon filled. Captain Caryll had redeemed his promise of paying her an other visit, and by degrees drifted into the habit of passing many of bis leisure hours at Lady Mary's. But without any arriere-pensee. Whatever feelings he might at one time have entertained for her were apparently com pletely obliterated, and replaced by those of sincere and cordial friendship. As Edward had observed to his brother, Lady Mary had a very pleasant house in a small way, and as she generally remained in London for some time after the rest of the world, it was a great resource to those who were similarly situated to find a hostess, who was sure to be at home every evening, and had the knack of collect ing around her an agreeable society. Few were the days on which Captain Caryll did not find time to pay her a visit, sometimes in company with his brother, sometimes alone; but never by word or deed did he give her reason to suppose that he regarded her in any other light than that of a dear friend, in whose welfare he took the deepest interest. Whether the lady's feelings were of the"], [63, "55 THE CARYLLS. same nature may admit of a question, but at all events she regulated her demeanour by his. There was intimacy, but no familiarity. Once indeed she addressed him as Edward, rather to the surprise of his brother and Miss Leycester, who alone chanced to be present, but she lost no time in correcting her lapsus lingu\u00e6. \" I really beg your pardon, Captain Caryll. I quite forgot we are no longer boy and girl together at Oakfield Chase.\" \"Ah,'' said Edward, coolly, \"that is one of the penalties one pays for growing old. Ladies no longer think it decorous to address one as in the days of one's youth. Now here is Walter : you may call him by his christian name for the next five or six years.\" \" I am sure,\" exclaimed Walter, \" I hope Lady Mary will never call me by any other. I don't think I should know myself in this house under any other name but that of Walter.\" \" Wait till you are married,\" said Lady Mary, \" and see what your wife will say to my addressing her husband as Walter.\""], [64, "56 THE CARYLLS. \" I have already registered in my mind,' replied Walter, \" several excellent reasons against marrying at all ; that will make another.\" \" Not at all,\" said Miss Beatrice; \" you have only to marry me, and she may call you Walter to the end of the chapter, if she likes.\" \" Ah, Miss Leycester, I am sorry to say I am not half good enough for you.\" \" Now I should like to know if I ought to thank you for the compliment, or cut you for the refusal. Who will tell me ? \" \" You forget it is not leap-year, Beatrice,\" said Lady Mary ; \" but, may I ask what your excellent reasons are ? \" \" In the first place I am too poor to marry. It is as much as I can do to support myself. What on earth would become of my wife and the twelve children whom a poor man is cer tain to have ! \" \" You may marry an heiress.\" \" No, for I am too proud to owe all to my wife.\" \" A regular man's reason. You dignify it with the name of pride ; I call it selfishness.\""], [65, "57 THE CARYLLS. \" Well, I will not dispute with you about the name to be given to this feeling, but there it is. And after all I am not so sure that one is rich with a rich wife. She would always be throwing her fortune in one's teeth. It would be one continued, ' Oh, my dear, with the money I brought you, you have no right to refuse me an opera-box, carriages, horses, etc.,' and it would be awkward to say her nay. In short, I should only be my wife's steward, with the disadvantage of not being able to throw up my situation, if inclined. No, I am convinced that, if a poor man must marry, he had much better marry some girl brought up in poverty and used to privations.\" \" Perhaps you are right. Have you ex hausted your list of objections ? \" \" The most cogent remains to be stated. If I loved my wife, and without that I would not marry, I should be intensely jealous, and consequently, in all probability, extremely miserable.\" \" That does look like a reason. A jealous man or woman ought never to marry. They d 5"], [66, "58 THE CARYLLS. make themselves and everybody about them wretched.\" \" Take a jealons man for a husband ; I should think not indeed ! \" exclaimed Miss Leycester. \" I would not have you now, Mr. Caryll, at any price.\" Before he could reply the door opened, other visitors were announced, and the dis cussion dropped. No one seemed to think it fitted for general conversation. A few days later Miss Leycester left London, but she was soon replaced by another guest, One morning Captain Caryll, on calling in Park-street, was very disagreeably surprised by finding Lady Barbara Oakley established at her niece's. She had come to town to consult her dentist, in other words, to procure a set of false teeth. Although past seventy, her mind was as vigorous as ever, her tongue had lost nothing of its caustic tone, and she still pertinaciously adhered to her old antipa thies and fancied grievances. Her surprise when she heard Edward announced was as great as his own, for she knew that during Colonel Segrave's life he had never set foot"], [67, "THE CARYLLS. 59 in her niece's house, and that lady had not thought it necessary to announce the renewal of intercourse between herself and her old admirer. Consequently when, upon an inti mation from Lady Mary that the lady in the arm-chair was his old acquaintance Lady Barbara, Captain Caryll advanced to address her, she felt all her old dislike revive. \" Is it possible you are Edward Caryll?\" she said, in an acrimonious tone of voice, as if she felt herself aggrieved. \" You are grown so old I should never have recognized you.\" \" And with good reason, I am sorry to say,\" he replied, rather nettled. \" I do not suppose we have either of us grown younger during the ten years which have elapsed since we last met. However, I should have recognized Lady Barbara Oakley anywhere, at all events by the sound of her voice.\" She looked at him sharply. \" I trust Mrs. Caryll is well,\" she said. \"I forget if you have any children.\" \"I hope not,\" he replied, laughing; \"for as yet no Mrs. Caryll has been called into existence.\""], [68, "60 THE CARYLLS. \" More shame for you. I suppose, though your father is an embarrassed man, you will have enough to support a wife in your own condition in life. You ought to marry. All men ought to marry.\" \"Indeed! And why?\" \" Because, if they don't, they go prowling about after other men's wives, disturbing the peace of families.\" \" I wonder,\" said Edward, \" if that is the system adopted by ladies who never marry ! But, however, to keep myself out of tempta tion, I select my friends, almost exclusively I think I may say, from unmarried men.\" \" Scamps like yourself, no doubt,\" she muttered to herself, but quite loud enough to be heard. \" Dear Lady Barbara,\" said Edward, \" I must entreat you to pardon my stupidity ; it has only just occurred to me that you have long been aware of my respectful admiration, and the advice with which you have been good enough to favour me encourages me to hope that it had particularly reference to my long concealed passion for yourself. Deign,\" he"], [69, "61 THE CARYLLS. continued, kneeling at her feet, \" to bless me with your hand, and I promise \u2014 \" His rhapsody was broken short by a smart box on the ear, which greatly disturbed his equilibrium. \" Lady Mary,\" said her aunt, rising from her chair, \" I did not expect in your house to be exposed to such insolent buffoonery. Lady Barbara Oakley is no fitting subject for the scurvy jests of a Captain Edward Caryll ; \" and with these words she sailed majestically out of the room."], [70, "62 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER IV. For a moment after Lady Barbara's disappear ance, Lady Mary and her visitor sat looking at each other without uttering a word. Captain Caryll was the first to speak. \" I cannot tell you,\" he said, \" how sorry I am to have exposed you to so disagreeable a scene. But what could I do ? Her words and manner were so very discourteous, not to say offensive, that I could only laugh or answer her in the same tone, and I thought it better to laugh.\" \" Oh, I quite acquit you,\" she replied, \" of having done anything to justify my poor aunt's violence. The fault was mine, perhaps, for I might have written to you to warn you of her being here. She came quite unexpectedly last night, and as she departs on Thursday, you had better not present yourself here again till she is gone. In my defence I may say"], [71, "THE CARYLLS. 63 that I did not think she would keep up her old feud, but she certainly does not grow more forgiving as she grows older.\" \" Forgiving ! But what has she to forgive ; now at all events ? I am not conscious of ever having done [anything to provoke her enmity.\" \" Do you really mean to say you are not aware of the cause of her dislike ? \" Edward coloured a little, but he replied, steadily enough \u2014 \"No, indeed; I have not the slightest idea.\" \" Did you never hear that, in the days of her youth, she had set her heart upon being Lady Barbara Caryll, but Sir Edward thought proper to marry your mother. She has never forgiven him, though I never heard that he was in any way to blame, and her animosity extends to the children of her fancied rival. You had better warn Walter to keep out of her way, but do not betray her secret.\" \" Poor Lady Bab!\" said Edward. \" Your story is quite new to me; I never heard a word of it before. After all, instead of box-"], [72, "64 THE CARYLLS. ing my ears, she would have done better to have accepted my proposal, and allowed me to make her some amends for my father's in difference. Perhaps we should get on very well as man and wife, though I cannot say I should have liked her much for a mother.\" \" At all events,\" Lady Mary observed, without much thought, \" she gave you very good advice. You have led a single life quite long enough. Do you never mean to marry ?\" \" Well, I suppose it will come to that some day or other, when I find a woman to suit ine in every way. But, to tell you the truth, if Walter were my next brother, instead of John, I should abjure matrimony altogether, and leave it to him to carry on the race. I am very well as I am now, and who can say what my lot may be with a wife and children to look after and provide for.\" \" Now, indeed, my aunt might have said \u2014 But what are the qualifications you require in a wife ?\" \" Well, I dare say you will think my ideas rather peculiar. She must be good-humoured,"], [73, "THE CARYLLS. 65 with a certain amount of good sense, but nothing extraordinary in the way of intellect or beauty, and with a large fortune, fifty thousand pounds at least, for I want to restore the Carylls to something like prosperity ; at present we can only just hold our heads above water. What I should prefer would be a rich stockbroker's widow without encumbrances, but, when the proper times arrives, I shall tell my solicitors to look out for some one who will be willing to exchange her thousands for the title of my lady.\" \" And you think you could find happiness in such a marriage !\" exclaimed Lady Mary, half indignantly. \" As for happiness to be found in married life, and all the romance of love and passion, I have long outlived those dreams. But by marrying a woman who is an object of indif ference to me, I shall have the best chance of securing what I most value \u2014 peace and tran quillity of mind \u2014 which I will never willingly put it in the power of any human being to disturb. The stockbroker's widow may be a myth, but in this I am quite serious \u2014 that if"], [74, "66 THE CARYLLS. ever 1 do marry, it will be without love ; a mere mariage de convenance ; and what is more, if ever I had reason to suspect that I was be coming attached to any woman, I would never see her more.\" He spoke so earnestly there could be no doubt of his sincerity. Lady Mary was silent for a minute or so, when, probably thinking that topic of conver sation exhausted, she asked, rather abruptly \u2014 \" What are you thinkiug of doing this autumn ?\" \" I shall stay with Savage till Doncaster is over, and the rest of my leave I shall pass at home.\" \" We shall be near neighbours then, for Lord Isleworth has asked me to pass some months at the Chase ; in short, till Easter if I like.\" \" I am indeed delighted to hear it, and so will my father be, for you know you were always a great favourite of his, and he never speaks of you but in terms of regard and, I may say, affection.\" \" Which I cordially return, I assure you."], [75, "THE CARYLLS. 67 It will be a real pleasure to me to see him and your sisters again, but in many respects my visit will be a painful one. I have never been there since my poor father's death.\" \" Do you mean to say you have never re ceived an invitation ?\" \" Never. Lord Isleworth was not on good terms with my father, who wished him to make some arrangement about the property, which he refused to do. And while I was living with my aunt all intercourse between us was out of the question, for she always spoke of him as an interloper and usurper, who had no right to either title or estate. She used to call him Perkin Warbeck, and as she is not particularly careful before whom she speaks, no doubt it came to his ears.\" \" I should think,\" said Edward, laughing, \" as he made his claims good, which is more than poor Perkin Warbeck ever could do, he can afford to forgive her. At all events, he could not make you responsible for your aunt's scandalum magnatum, and you have been long enough out of her leading-strings."], [76, "68 THE CARYLLS. He ought to have remembered that he is your nearest relation in the male line.\" \" Yes, but there was another side to the question. Brentford and I have always been on terms of intimacy, and I suspect his father was afraid that I was setting my cap at him.\" \" Ah, I remember now. He proposed to you and you refused him ?\" \" Yes ; but how do you know that ?\" \" Oh, Brentford made no secret of it. He is not a bad fellow, though not over wise, and he went all over London telling the story of his love and his despair to anyone whom he could find to listen to him.\" \" Poor Brentford ! But he has quite for given me, even to the extent of making me the confidant of a new passion.\" \" And who may this new flame be ?' \" Ah, that you must not ask ; I am upon honour. But to go on with my story : Lord Isleworth found out somehow or other what had passed between us, very likely from Brentford himself, and the consequence is that he has taken me iuto favour. He called on"], [77, "THE CARYLLS. 69 me two or three times when he was in town i and really seemed interested about me. He said that he hoped in future 1 should always look upon the Chase as a home whenever it suited me, and even went the length of kiss ing my forehead in a paternal sort of way, when he took leave of me at his last visit. I am not sorry to be on good terms with the head of my family, for as regards near rela tions I stand nearly alone in the world. But good gracious!\" she exclaimed, looking at the clock, \"it is nearly two o'clock. I must turn you out, for my aunt will be coming down to luncheon. As soon as she has left London I shall expect to see you again.\" \" You must send me or Walter a line, to announce that auspicious event, for she may take it into her head to stay a day or two longer than she originally intended.\" \"Very well, I will let you know, and you and Walter must come and dine with me.\" \" Most certainly not. I will do nothing to encourage your extravagance.\" \" You forget,\" she replied, \" all the money"], [78, "70 THE CARYLLS. I shall save while I am in the country. But come,\" she continued, pushing over the ink stand to him, \"you shall order your own dinner, so that if there is any extravagance, the fault will be yours.'' He complied, and, as his bill of fare, wrote down \u2014 \" Fried soles, a leg of mutton, and an apple pie.'' \" Do you think,\" she said, when it was pre sented to her, \" I could venture to lay such a carte as this before my cook, when I have company to dinner, for in her eyes you would be company. She would discharge me on the spot.\" \"And a good thing too, I have no doubt,\" he replied. \" But we will make a compromise. I have promised my sister and her husband, the Shorehams, a white-bait dinner at Green wich. Why should not you join the party ? You will be able to renew your acquaintance with Lucy.\" \" I have a good mind to say, \u2022 Most cer tainly not, I will do nothingto encourage your extravagance ;' but that would be punishing"], [79, "THE CARYLLS. 71 myself, for I shall really be glad to meet your sister again, so I accept ; and now you must positively take your departure.\" Edward Caryll had strong family affec- tions ; but, in his relations with Lucy Shore- ham, there was something more. She was the eldest of the family, one year older than himself, and since the days of their childhood the most unreserved confidence had existed between them. When he was quartered in London, few were the days on which he did not contrive to see her, though Mr. Shore- ham, from motives of economy, had estab- lished his domicile at Kensington, which was rather out of his beat. For his brother-in-law Edward had a great regard. With nothing but his profession to depend upon, Mr. Shore- ham was already in possession of a good in- come; but he had a large and increasing family, and felt that for many years to come he must work hard for their sakes. Edward, at the suggestion of his sister, sometimes urged upon him the necessity of some relaxa tion, but was not often successful. \" My dear Edward,\" he said, upon one of these occasions,"], [80, "72 THE CARYLLS. \"Hike work, and I hate idleness ; besides, if, notwithstanding all ray remonstrances, Lucy will persist in presenting me with a new child every year, of course I must pro vide for it somehow.\" A lax style of argu ment, for which his wife very properly re proved him with great severity. Of course Lucy had been cognizant of all the early love-passages between her brother and Lady Mary Oakley, and great had been her indignation when informed of the lady's en gagement to Colonel Segrave. It was, there fore, with no little surprise and disapproba tion, that she heard of Edward's having renewed his intimacy with her. She con sidered it as a proof of weakness on the part of one whom she had hitherto looked up to as a model of something near perfection ; but by degrees this feeling subsided, especially when she became convinced that no fresh entanglement was likely to ensue, and she listened more patiently to Edward's expostu lations on behalf of his faithless love. At last, to clinch the matter, he told her the story of the diamond necklace, and all her"], [81, "THE CARYLLS. 73 good-will for the friend of her childhood returned in full force. Hitherto the inter course between the two ladies had been limited to a yearly interchange of cards, for Lucy had naturally recoiled from cultivating the intimacy of one whose early conduct had excited her contempt, and whose subsequent career had apparently been devoted entirely to the world and its pleasures, while Lady Mary had refrained from obtruding her visits where she instinctively felt they would not be welcome. Belonging to two such very different sets, chance-meetings were almost totally out of the question, nor were they less effectually separated by the habits and routine of their daily lives. Mrs. Shoreham lived for her husband and children, and it was upon very rare occasions indeed that she could be prevailed upon to accept an invitation ; Lady Mary, on the other hand, if not absolutely devoted to the world, was, at all events, generally surrounded by its devotees. In short, it would have been difficult to find a greater contrast than that which existed VOL. I. e"], [82, "74 THE CARYLLS. between these two women, once meeting almost daily, but who had not seen each other now for many years. Now, however, Lucy, under the influence of her brother's revelations, felt a sort of eagerness to renew her acquaintance with her early friend, whom at one time she loved like a sister, and to whom, being the eldest of the two, she had more than once acted the part of a mentor. When they had last met, Lady Mary was just emerging from the school-room, and, under the auspices of her aunt, was pre- paring for her introduction to society, with all the advantages which rank, and youth, and beauty could give her ; and, perhaps, Mrs. Shoreham had the very natural curiosity to ascertain by personal inspection which is most detrimental to female attractions \u2014 the racket and dissipation of ten London seasons, or brooding over a nursery of young children for the same length of time, and adding bien nially to their number. Be this as it may, she not only offered no opposition to Lady Mary's joining their party to Greenwich, but accepted Edward's pro-"], [83, "75 THE CARYLLS. posal to walk with him across the park, ancl call on her for the purpose of settling the details of their expedition. \" I know she will like it,\" said Captain Caryll to his sister one morning ; \"and as I received a line from her yesterday, announc ing Lady Barbara's departure, there is nothing in onr way; so put on your bonnet, and come.\" \" Do you think she would like to see the children ? Shall I take Ned with us ? It is such a lovely day, and he would like the walk. If he is tired we could come back in a Hansom. His great ambition is to be a cabman.\" \" And a very laudable ambition too. Sunt guos curriculo. Do you remember learning Latin to be able to help your stupid brother? But to return to Ned. I think I would not take him on a first visit. She has no children of her own \u2014 if she had her posi tion would be very different \u2014 and the sight of yours might give her unpleasant thoughts.\" \" True ; yet I should have liked \u2014 but that e 2"], [84, "76 THE CARYLLS. will do for another time. And you think she will be glad to see me ?\" \" Sure ; in fact she would have called on you long ago, but she did not quite know how you would take it after so long a cessation of all intercourse. I suspect she is a little afraid of you ?\" \" Well,\" said Lucy, \" I cannot say I am exactly afraid of her, but I confess 1 do feel a little nervous.\" But when they did meet, all feeling of nervousness, or even of embarrassment, speedily vanished. Lady Mary was so cordial, so unaffectedly delighted to see her old friend, that it must have been a colder heart than Mrs. Shoreham's to resist her influence. \" How good \u2014 how very good of you, Lucy,\" she said, \" to come and see me in this way. I feel now that I shall be a wel come visitor at your own house. And I am dying to see your children ; I hear so much of them from their uncle. According to him, there are no such children in the world.\" \" Oh ! you must not believe him,\" Lucy"], [85, "THE CARYLLS. 77 replied, colouring with pleasure ; \" but they are not bad children on the whole. I wanted to bring my eldest boy with me to-day, but Edward\u2014\" \" I thought the walk would be too much for him,\" said Edward, hastily ; \" but now let us settle about Greenwich.\" At that moment Walter made his appear ance, and seemed to be not a little astonished at seeing his sister. After his first greeting to the lady of the house, he exclaimed \u2014 \" You here, Lucy ! This is, indeed, an unexpected pleasure.\" \" That is a very free and easy way of ad dressing me, sir,\" she replied, \" I seem to know your face ; but if ever I knew you per sonally, it is so long ago \u2014 \" \" Now, Lady Mary, is not that a great deal too bad ? The last time I was at Kensington we were discussing subjects of intense interest to both of us \u2014 I believe it was my name sake's second tooth \u2014 when there came a squeal and a squall from the nursery, and Lucy bolted out of the room, saying she would be back in a minute ; and there I sat"], [86, "78 THE CARYLLS. waiting for her in vain for a good half-hour, when I naturally thought I had enough of it, and took my departure. Thank Heaven there are no children in this house. One can enjoy a little rational conversation without fear of interruption.\" \" Poor little Edith had knocked her face against the corner of the table, and she had a black eye for two or three days in conse quence,\" said Mrs. Shoreham, who could not refrain from casting a glance at Lady Mary, to see how she took Walter's thoughtless speech. But, if she felt any annoyance, that lady had served too long an apprenticeship in the ways of the world to show it. She only laughed, and told Walter that he was the most ungrateful of uncles, and that he ought to feel extremely obliged to his sister for the care and attention she bestowed on his nephews and nieces. \" I hope to make their acquaintance myself before long,\" she said ; \" and why should not you bring some of them to Greenwich ? \"We will make Walter look after them ; he can"], [87, "THE CARYLLS. 79 take them to see the park and the hospital, while we are eating our dinners.\" \"Well, Lady Mary,\" said Captain Caryll, \" Lucy has a great wish to take her eldest boy and girl, and I think one of the objects of her visit to day was to ask if they would bore you.\" \" No, indeed, I shall be delighted, and still more so if I can be of any use.\" \" You can be of the greatest, Lady Mary,\" said Walter; \" you can take me.\" \" No, indeed, Walter,\" said Lucy. \" You must go with George ; he cannot get away till the afternoon, and he says he will not go at all, unless he can get a companion. That will just suit you, as you have always so much to do at the Foreign Office, according to your own showing. Edward and I mean to go early, by water, with the children, to show them all that is to be seen, and if you will join us, Mary, you have only to say what time will suit you best.\" Perhaps Lady Mary thought that this would be rather too much of a good thing, for she replied \u2014"], [88, "80 THE CARYLLS. \" I am afraid in this hot weather the river and sight-seeing afterwards would be a little too much for me. But I can conciliate all interests ; my carriage holds four, and I will bring down Walter and Mr. Shoreham.\" \" The very thing,\" exclaimed Edward and Walter, simultaneously, and Lucy acquiesced, half regretting that her friend should be de prived for so many hours of the society of Master and Miss Shoreham, half rejoicing that she had secured for her husband so plea sant a mode of conveyance."], [89, "THE CARYLLS. 81 CHAPTER V. The white-bait dinner went off very well. The weather was delightful, the guests in high good humour and pleased with each other, and the children extremely well-be haved. To this, perhaps, the presence of their father slightly contributed, for, though very fond of his children, he knew how to main tain his authority, a quality in which Lucy was rather deficient. If she sometimes plucked up courage to resist their turbulence, their wheedling she could not withstand; but on Mr. Shoreham both turbulence and wheed ling were thrown away. On great occasions, when called upon to hold a bed of justice, he was in the habit of arming himself with all the majesty of the law by putting on his legal paraphernalia, and the boldest and most rebellious spirit in the nursery would quail, e 5"], [90, "82 THE CARYLLS. if it was whispered that papa had gone for his wig. But for all that they loved him well, for, if strict, they knew that he was just and impartial, a virtue which children, as well as men, soon learn to appreciate. But in addition to his virtues as father of a family, he was a delightful companion, full of fun, boyish as a boy of fourteen with the solid good sense of a man of thirty, abound ing in anecdote, but carefully avoiding all professional allusions. When the awkward ness of their first meeting had a little sub sided \u2014 for he was decidedly shy with strangers \u2014 he and Lady Mary got on very well together, and they were both surprised on arriving to find how quickly the time had passed. Now that the ice was broken, all parties seemed determined to make up for lost time by seeing as much of each other as possible. For the first time since she had left Oakfield Chase on her father's death, Lady Mary found herself the intimate of a family circle, by all of whom she seemed to be recognised as a member, and it gave her an indescribable"], [91, "THE CARYLLS. 83 feeling not only of pleasure, but of confidence and repose. She felt that if in her need she should require assistance, it would be given her, not because she was Lady Mary Segrave, one of the leaders in the world of fashion, but for her own sake, as a tribute to the re gard and friendship which she had recon quered from her earliest companions. And she knew in her heart that she owed it all to Edward Caryll. A word from him had turned the balance in her favour, for she felt that the long estrangement which had existed between her and Lucy was owing solely to her seemingly heartless conduct to Lucy's brother. How could she ever show her re pentance for the past and her present grati tude! How could she ever make him amends ! It was not a problem easy of solution, and as regarded amends, Edward appeared neither to expect them nor to wish for them. They were living on the most friendly footing, and with that he was evidently content. Of any return to the feelings he had once entertained for her, there was not the slightest trace. He"], [92, "84 THE CARYLLS. showed his regard for her openly and without scruple. He had even more than once spoken of the affection he felt for her, but it had been avowed so simply and naturally in the course of conversation, that it was impossible to at tribute to him any meaning beyond that which he had expressed. He had offered himself to her as a brother; she had accepted him as such, and it was clear that as such, and such only, he intended her to look upon him. Whatever her own feelings or wishes may have been, she was never for a moment be trayed into giving expression to them by word or deed \u2014 hardly in thought. If the position in which she was placed was a trying one, she knew that it was in a great measure of her own making ; her pride, or perhaps it would be fairer to say, an innate sense of delicacy, revolted from the idea of bestowing her affections on one who would never make them a return. She summoned all her courage and mental energies to her aid, and if she could not eradicate the feelings which threatened to take possession of her heart, at least she would keep them under control. Her weakness, for"], [93, "85 THE CARYLLS. such she felt it was, should never be sus pected by human being, least of all by him who was the object of it. It was not so very difficult ; it would have been more so perhaps, had they met less frequently ; but seeing each other almost daily, there was no danger of her being sur prised into any sudden expression of feeling. She occasionally met bim in the morning at his sister's, and sometimes the Shorehams walked across the park in the fine August evenings to drink tea with her, for Lucy was hardly ever to be lured out of her house till the children were in bed ; and on these oc casions she carefully studied and successfully imitated Mrs. Shoreham's demeanour to her brother, till at last art became a second nature. The time, however, was fast ap proaching when these artifices would no longer be needed. A general break-up was at hand. One by one almost all Lady Mary's habitues had left town ; the Shorehams, with all their children, were going to the inevit able sea-side ; Captain Caryll was on the eve of departure ; Lady Mary herself was going"], [94, "86 THE CARYLLS. on a round of visits, to wind up at Lord Isle worth's ; and Walter alone was left behind to keep watch and ward over the deserted city. \" And to tell you the truth,\" she said to Captain Caryll, on occasion of his calling to take leave of her, \" I shall not be sorry to get out of London for a few months. I am not sure that I have many rural tastes, but I want rest. And now that your sister is go ing, there will be no one left I shall care to see.'' \" Thank you,\" said Edward ; \" I think you might have had the charity to say ' your sister and her brother.' \" \" Oh, cela va sans dire,\" she replied, with a laugh, but colouring a little. \" I thought you would have supplied the omission your self; I had no idea your were so modest, but at all events, I say it now in all truth and sincerity, after all the proofs of interest you have given me, you cannot doubt that I shall always look upon you as a dear and valued friend.\" \" I am sure of it. And when do you think of going?\""], [95, "87 THE CARYLLS. \" On Monday. The only one I am sorry to leave is poor Walter. He will find it dull when we are all gone. I know it made a great difference to me when Beatrice Leycester left me. Even Aunt Bab's arrival could not console me.\" \" That is being very ungrateful,\" said Edward, laughing. \" But I can quite under stand Miss Leycester's being a loss to you. She seemed such a good-humoured, cheerful girl that I took a great liking to her, though she is not exactly the style of young lady I admire in general, nor you either, I imagine.\" \" You are right, she is a little fast, and I am not fond of fast young ladies in general. But it sits so differently npon her from what it does upon others. There is no affectation in it; it is merely the exuberance of youthful spirits, downright gaiete de c\u0153ur. But I regret it, for others will not judge her as leniently as I do, and I love her, for with all her eccen tric sayings and doings she is a high-prin cipled, noble-hearted girl. Perhaps I have a fellow-feeling for her, for, like me, she lost"], [96, "88 THE CARYLLS. both her parents when she was a child. Old Dean Leycester, her uncle and John's, was her guardian ; but he was a confirmed invalid, and thought he did his duty by sending her to school, and when she was too old for that by taking her to live with him, and allowing her to do just as she pleased ; at his death of course she was obliged to leave the Deanery.\" \" And where does she live now?\" \"At a small place her father left her in Hertfordshire. One of her old teachers lives with her as companion or chaperon, and keeps house for her, but she is not much at home. She has many friends and relations who are always glad to have her, for she is never in the way, and always ready to amuse and be amused. She is quite a treasure in a country house.\" \"I wonder,\" said Edward, \"you do not persuade her to live ,with you. You would do her good, and wean her from her evil ways, and would be none the worse for a cheerful companion always with you. You said you missed her much when she left you.\""], [97, "THE CARYLLS. 89 \" I should like it well enough,\" Lady Mary replied, \" and perhaps it may come to that. But she has not yet sown her wild oats, if one may apply such a phrase to a woman. I cer tainly did miss her, and found the house quite dull without her; but I suspect there was one who missed her more than I did.\" \" Do you allude to Mr. Leycester ?\" \" John ! no. They are always at daggers drawn. What do you think of one Mr. Walter Caryll?\" \" Walter ! Impossible.\" \" And why ?\" \" Well, that is a difficult question to an swer, so I will merely say that it appears to me in the highest degree improbable.\" \" And why ?\" she persisted. \" I will only refer you,' ' he replied, \" to his own declaration, that he would never marry a woman with money, and Miss Leycester is an heiress, I believe, though not in a large way.\" \" Beatrice,\" said Lady Mary, \" has about eight hundred a year in land, and twenty thousand pounds left her by her uncle the dean.\""], [98, "90 THE CARYLLS. \" That makes her a greater heiress than I thought. But I should say that Miss Ley cester would be the very woman to confirm the truth of Walter's assertion that a poor man marrying a rich wife would be none the better for it. I do not for a moment suppose that she would taunt him with her wealth, but with her tastes I suspect he would find himself a poorer man than he is at present with his two hundred a year. After all, I rather incline to his theory, that for a poor man the best wife is a woman inured to privations.\" \" My dear Captain Caryll, the most specious theory will yield when brought into the pre sence of an all-absorbing influence. And I do not think you quite do Beatrice justice. If she loved her husband, and she would marry no one she did not love, she would make every sacrifice for him. I do not say that is the case here. I believe her heart to be untouched, but I doubt its being so with your brother.\" \" Then all I can say is that I am very sorry to hear it. But what grounds have you for your belief?''"], [99, "THE CARYLLS. 91 \" If by grounds you mean facts, I have none. My conviction is founded upon many little circumstances too minute to be detailed ; a look, a gesture, a word, his general de meanour in her presence.

She likes him, and likes his society ; but my belief is she has no more thought of marrying him than I have. She has never given him the slightest encouragement.\" \" Poor Wat ! Poor, dear Wat !

I was in hopes that he at least \u2014 \" He stopped abruptly. \" Yes,\" said Lady Mary, after a moment of embarrassed silence; \"he will no doubt feel"], [100, "92 THE CARYLLS. it acutely at first, but his nature is too elastic to yield to despondency for long.\" \" God grant you may be right. And now I must say adieu. I suppose we shall meet again before very long ?\" \" I shall not be at Lord Isleworth's till the beginning of December, for I have many visits to pay, and mean to make that my last.

Your influence might have some effect in checking his passion before it goes too far.\" \" My dear Lady Mary, did you ever hear of a person in love being talked or argued out of it ? I never did. But I will think it over. My first step must be to ascertain how far your suspicions are founded. No doubt what you have said has given me pain, but I do full justice to your motives, and thank you for the confidence you have reposed in me. And now good-bye, and God bless you.\" Lady Mary was partly right in her sur mises. Walter was greatly attracted by Miss"], [101, "93 THE CARYLLS. Leycester, and was not without hopes that this attraction was mutual. The very open ness and familiarity with which she had treated him, the unscrupulous manner in which she had put his services in requisition on every occasion, and invoked his assistance in all her little difficulties, and which would have been a warning to one of greater ex perience, only served to confirm him in his error. He looked upon every fresh exertion as a proof of increasing favour, and as giving him something like a claim upon her affec tions. She, on the other hand, saw in him only a schoolboy of a larger growth, a good humoured and obliging companion, a sort of playfellow, executing her behests, complying with her caprices without a murmur, and deeming himself amply paid for his pains by the smile with which she rewarded his obe dience. But for all this it would be too much to say that he was in love, as yet at all events. His passion was of the head, not of the heart. Had he been a poet, which fortunately for him he was not, he would have composed"], [102, "94 THE CARYLLS. sonnets to his mistress's eyebrows, and the other charms of her person. As it was, he contented himself with soliloquizing in private over Miss Beatrice's perfections and the un speakable happiness of the man who should be fortunate enough to win her love. But he was in a fair way of converting this ideal passion into a real one, for he was just at the age when the yearning of the heart for sympathy and affection makes itself most sen sibly felt. The doctrine that nature abhors a vacuum is now, I believe, exploded amongst philosophers, but it undoubtedly still holds good as regards the youthful breast. It so happened that on that particular day the two brothers were engaged to a farewell dinner at the Shorehams, and the conversa tion, as might be expected, turned principally upon the events of the season that was just over, and the actors and actresses who had appeared upon the scene. Of course Lady Mary Segrave occupied a very prominent place amongst them, and she would have had no reason to be dissatisfied had she heard the terms in which she was mentioned by them"], [103, "THE CARYLLS. 95 all. Walter and Mr. Shoreham were particu larly energetic in their expressions of admira tion, and the latter gentleman went so far as to declare that she was the most agreeable and conversable woman he had met with since his wife had thought proper to devote all her mental energies to her nursery, to which de claration Lucy's only reply was \u2014 \" Ah, poor Mary, she is much to be pitied, she is so fond of children.\" \" And what sort of a person is her friend, Miss Leycester ?\" continued Mr. Shoreham. \" I go so little into the world that I have never yet fallen in with the genus of fast young ladies, and I confess I have rather a curiosity to see one.\" \"You won't see one in Miss Leycester, then,\" said Walter. \" I do not call her fast ; do you, Edward?\" \" Yes, decidedly ; but not obnoxiously so.

She does not in the least give me the idea of a marrying woman. She likes her liberty and independence too well.\" \" Is she rich ? \" Lucy asked. \" Yes. That is to say she has about fifteen or sixteen hundred a year.\" \" Just the wife for you, \"Walter,\" observed Lucy. \" Why did you not try your luck while you had a chance? \""], [105, "THE CARYLLS. 97 \" Thank you,\" replied Walter, gulping something down ; \" but if, as Edward says, Miss Leycester likes liberty and independence so do I.\" \" Besides, Walter has an objection to heiresses,\" said his brother. \" That is to say, I should have a great objection to marrying a woman merely for her money, but, if I really liked her, I should not let that stand in the way. A girl may make a very good wife though she is an heiress.\" This declaration was not exactly in accord ance with one he had made on a former occasion, as Edward felt greatly inclined to remind him. But he thought better of it. He felt that what he had already said must have been unpalatable to his brother, to say the least of it, and he had no wish to add to his annoyance. Enough had been done to open his eyes, the rest must be left to himself. Moreover, he had no wish to take the rest of the company into his confidence, and if he had it did net seem likely that he would be able to enlist them as allies. As soon as Walter F VOL.

It is rather hard upon her that she cannot be left in peace to enjoy her dogs and her horses. But Lucy thinks no woman can be happy without a husband and half-a-dozen children, and I have no doubt Miss Leycester wonders how any body can be happy with them.\" Walter puffed away vigorously at his cigar. At last he said, \" I do not know how it may"], [113, "105 THE CARYLLS. be with Miss Leycester, but I could name more than one exceedingly fast girl who has settled down into a very quiet wife.\" \" So have I,\" replied his brother, \"but then it was assumed for a purpose. It was the means for an end, for some girls think that men are attracted by boldness and inde licacy, in which I presume to differ with them. Of course it answers occasionally, and when the end is attained the lady throws off her masquerade dress and comes out in her na tural character. But this is not the case with Miss Leycester. There is no affectation or masquerading in her proceedings ; she is fol lowing her natural bent. No doubt, as she grows older she will quiet down, but as yet she has not sown her wild oats, to use Lady Mary's expression, and till she has she will not think of marrying.\" \" Is that Lady Mary's opinion?\" asked Walter. \" I should say so from different remarks she has made about her cousin. It would not surprise me if, some day or other, the two P 5"], [114, "106 THE CARYLLS. were to live together, and then, if Miss Bea trice is inclined to take a husband, with her fortune and good looks and animation she can pick and choose.\" Walter puffed away more vigorously than ever, but if he wished to comment upon what he had just heard, he did not find the appro priate words. He reverted to his sister. \" After all,\" he said, \" there may be too much of a good thing, and I wish Lucy was not so completely absorbed by those children of hers.\" \" Everyone has his or her vocation, and rearing a family seems to be Lucy's. And yet, if you had known her as well as I did in the days of her girlhood, you would have said that she was born, if not for better, for greater things. During the ten or twelve years I have been knocking about the world I have met with no one to compare to her in head or heart. No one, to see her now, would guess that she is mistress of half-a-dozen lan guages, with a thorough knowledge of music, and having gone deeper into mathematics than"], [115, "107 THE CARYLLS. half the senior wranglers in Cambridge. And almost entirely self-taught.\" \" When she has settled her family to her satisfaction,\" said Walter, \" perhaps she will return to her former occupations.\" \" No ; after her children will come her grandchildren. Lucy has no ambition to shine, and never had. She has a powerful intellect and cultivated it to the best of her ability, but she never made a display of it ; I do not believe even my father knows, to their full extent at least, the powers of her mind. I do, for, till she married, we were inseparable, and I really believe the little I do know I owe to her.\" \" By your acoount,\" said Walter, \" Shore ham and the children will have much to answer for.\" \" They are her happiness and pride. No worldly triumphs could replace them; and she is most fortunate in both. Her husband is one in ten thousand, and the children are good children, not troublesome and mis chievous, as some one I could name used to be. As for little Gualdrada, she is out and"], [116, "108 THE CARYLLS. out the prettiest and most attractive child I ever saw; she quite won Lady Mary's heart at Greenwich.\" \" What on earth had the poor girl done to have such a barbarous name inflicted on her.\" \" All my doing, Wat. In the days of my youth Gualdrada dei Bellincioni was one of my favourite heroines, and I remember as well as if it was yesterday, though it must be fifteen years ago, sitting under the great oak opposite the island with Lucy and telling her the story. How she was the most beau tiful girl in Florence, how the Emperor Otho admired her, and how her father told him that, if it so pleased him, he was at liberty to kiss her. But Gualdrada refused, and said no man should kiss her except her husband ; an answer which was not only commended by the Emperor, but procured for her the hand of Count Guido, one of the most powerful Tuscan nobles. Lucy vowed then and there that if ever she had a daughter she would call her Gualdrada, and she kept her word, rather, I suspect, to Shoreham's annoyance.\" \" I suppose,\" said Walter, \" the winding up"], [117, "109 THE CARYLLS. with a great marriage had something to do with it.\" \" Perhaps. Ah, Wat, what happy days those were ! When our dear mother was still alive. It seems at times as if I could recall every incident of my boyhood, all my dreams of ambition and happiness, my aspirations for love and fame ; and it gives me a pang of regret when I reflect that, at thirty-two years of age, not one of them has been realized, or is ever likely to be.\" He spoke in a tone of despondency that seemed to be catching, for Walter walked on by his side in silence. They arrived at the Knightsbridge Barracks, where Captain Caryll was then domiciled. \" Will you come in, Wat? it is not too late,\" he said. But Walter refused. He felt that it was not in his power to give a more cheerful tone to the conversation, and he wished to be alone. He had plenty to reflect upon. \" Then we must say good-bye now, for I go down by the early train to-morrow,\" said his brother. \" I wish you had accepted Savage's"], [118, "110 THE CARYLLS. invitation, and we could have gone down together.\" \" And I am beginning to wish it too,\" Walter replied, \" now that it is too late. But we shall all meet at Christmas.\" \" As far as you and I are concerned, we shall meet sooner, for my leave will be out at the end of October. But I hope to have a fortnight at home in January. God bless you, dear Walter, and keep up a brave heart.\" They shook hands warmly and Walter walked on, deeply moved by the affectionate interest with which Captain Caryll had taken leave of him. In his present frame of mind he could not forbear from looking upon it as a word of warning against impending ill. And then, too, the exhortation to keep up a brave heart. Had Edward guessed his secret ? If he had it was clear that he anticipated no satisfactory result, and every word he had uttered in reference to Miss Leycester must have been intended to prepare his brother for probable disappointment."], [119, "111 THE CARYLLS. The next day was Lady Mary's last in London, and naturally Walter made a point of calling on her. But though he more than once, with what he considered to be the very perfection of art, contrived to turn the con versation on Miss Leycester, he failed in ob taining any elucidation of his doubts. It was a subject which Lady Mary had made up her mind not to discuss with him, and she confined herself to the vaguest of generalities. Nor did she even seem to know where her cousin was at that moment. \" We are not in regular correspondence,\" she said. \" When we have anything to say to each other we write, but months often pass without the interchange of a letter between us, and then her friend, Miss Browne, is gene rally the amanuensis. Beatrice professes to dislike writing, and certainly she acts up to her professions. I have no doubt that if she received a written proposal of marriage, to Miss Browne would be confided the delicate task of refusing it.\" \" Or of accepting it,\" suggested Walter. \" Well; I suppose in case of acceptance she"], [120, "112 THE CARYLLS. would so far break through her habits as to signify it herself. I said refusing, because at present, at all events, that is by far the most probable alternative of the two.\" \" That is to say,\" rejoined Walter, \" as yet the right man has not made his appearance.'' \" I conclude so. And now tell me about yourself, and how you mean to get through the next four months, when we are gone.\" Another day passed, and Walter found himself alone in his glory. He was on the best possible terms with his fellow-clerks, but when the day's work was done they saw but little of each other, and it so happened that the two or three with whom he was most in timate were absent. He was thus left in a great measure to the companionship of his own thoughts, which were of anything but a rosy hue. But, as Lady Mary had said, his disposition was of too elastic a nature to give way to depression for any length of time. He began to look upon his brother's observa tions as uttered in total ignorance of the state of the case. \" Edward does not know,\" he argued, \" the"], [121, "113 THE CARYLLS. terms on which I am with Beatrice. How should he ? If I were her brother she could not treat me in a more familiar and uncere monious manner. She even called me Walter several times, without thinking it necessary to apologise for it, as Lady Mary did to Edward, and I never heard her call any other man by his Christian name, except her cousin, John Leycester. I am sure she likes me, and I am only sorry I did not speak a little more plainly when she was in London.\" In short, he succeeded in convincing him self that he had no cause for despair, and, notwithstanding all her cousin had said about Miss Beatrice's aversion to letter-writing, he began casting about for some means of in veigling or forcing her into a correspondence ; even a missive from Miss Browne would be better than nothing. Unfortunately he neither knew where Miss Leycester was to be heard of at that time, nor had he any means of finding out. Intense therefore was his delight \u2014 indeed he looked upon it almost as a miraculous in tervention of Providence in his favour \u2014 when"], [122, "114 THE CARYLLS. one morning he received a note from Lord Isleworth to the following effect \u2014 \u25a0 Dear Walter, \" I am passing through town, and only remain a couple of days.

Excuse the shortness of the invita tion. \" Yours truly, \" Isleworth.\" It is needless to say that an answer was dispatched at once, accepting the invitation, and rather before the hour named Walter was knocking at Lord Isleworth's door in Portman Square.

At that moment dinner was announced, and it was not till"], [124, "116 THE CARYLLS. they were seated that the noble host resumed the conversation. \" I am sorry I could not get anybody to meet you, but London seems quite deserted.

But I am not sorry he shows himself in the county.

And how is Lady Florence and the son and heir ?'' \" All of them, husband, wife, and child, are as well and as happy as possible. There was a time, Walter, when I hoped Flo and your brother might take a fancy to each other. But that was not to be, and I am now quite reconciled to the disappointment. The more I see of my son-in-law the more I like him. And perhaps Edward was a little too old for her. There is something like a difference of twelve years.\" \" And where are they now ?' ' asked Walter, determined, as soon as these family investiga tions were completed, to bring Miss Beatrice and her message on the tapis, but Lord Isle worth saved him the trouble. \" They are at their chateau in Perthshire, where I have been passing the last month, and where, by-the-bye, I left Beatrice Leycester.

Not with much success, however, though during the short time that elapsed between Dean Leycester's death and her coming of age I was ber guardian, in name at least, and I have a real affection for her, and she for me, I am convinced. Though rather distantly connected, I was on intimate terms with her father, who did me many a good turn when I was a captain on half pay, with a wife and two children, and a very small income.

Only you must be quick about it, for in a fortnight I am going south. The grouse-shooting is excellent.

He knew he was telling a lie, but it was in exculpation of his Love ; and however much theologians may condemn it, or divines preach against it, lovers always have acted, and, it is much to be feared, always will act upon the principle, that the end justifies the means. \"Rather enjoy it than otherwise, I suppose,\" rejoined his lordship. \" A very convenient theory for the angler, no [doubt, but I should like to hear what the fish have to say on the subject.

The amatory rhapsodies in which Walter Caryll indulged during his walk home that night would not have disgraced the lips of a Romeo. And certainly to a man in love the letter he had received contained ample food for his passion. It was late before he had finished reading it and re-reading it, weighing every phrase, every word, till his sanguine nature discovered in them hidden meanings, which they neither had nor were intended to have. Having carefully deposited his trea sure beneath his pillow, he retired to rest in the fond expectation of having his dreams enlivened by the incorporeal agency of Beatrice Leycester. Nor was he altogether disappointed, though when on awaking he endeavoured to reduce the chaotic jumble to something like order, all he could recollect was that on one occasion she had dragged"], [133, "THE CARYLLS. 125 him by the hair of his head from a hole in the ice, into which he had fallen, and rewarded him then and there by the offer of her hand for having allowed himself to be saved. He was inclined to reject this reversal of their respective duties as unnatural and ignominious, but a violent crick in the neck seemed to give consistency to the vision. Early the next morning the grouse arrived from Lord Isleworth, and were immediately forwarded to the Shorehams at Ramsgate. Then, having swallowed his breakfast with as much dispatch as if he expected it to be torn from him, Mr. Walter Caryll sallied forth to execute the commission with which Miss Leycester had honoured him. It was not till he had ransacked half-a-dozen shops and wasted half as many hours, that he could secure an article which to his critical taste appeared faultless. The price, it is true, was something more than five pounds, but as the balance, amounting to two pounds ten, came from his own private resources Miss Leyces ter would remain in ignorance that her maxi mum had been exceeded. The rest of the"], [134, "126 THE CARYLLS. morning was spent at the Foreign Office in concocting an answer to the letter with which he had been favoured, a task which, judging from the number of sheets of paper scribbled over and torn up in despair, seemed by no means easy of accomplishment. At length he succeeded in inditing an epistle not alto gether unworthy of the divinity to whom it was addressed, and so artfully con structed as to render an answer almost absolutely necessary. This and the whip were dispatched to Scotland the same evening, and then Walter sat down to calculate the number of hours which must elapse before he could bear of their safe arrival. Miss Beatrice did not keep him waiting. She wrote to him by return of post, but not exactly such a letter as he had hoped for. \" My dear Mr. Caryll,\" she said, \"the whip is this moment arrived ; I am charmed with it, and thank you most sincerely for having paid such immediate attention to my request. But I do not thank you at all for having at tempted to deceive me.

As soon as I reach a town where a post-office order is to be had I shall send you one for what I still owe you. When I give a commission I choose to pay for it, and when I make a present I choose it to be entirely my own. I am very angry with you, and believe you have played me this trick to prevent my ever troubling you again. \" Yours sincerely, \"Beatrice L.\" But then came a postcript. \" I was really angry when I began the letter, but I am beginning to calm down, and perhaps by the time we meet it will have blown over altogether. But never attempt anything of the sort again ; if you do we shall quarrel in earnest. I have changed my plans, and mean to leave this the day after to-morrow. \"B. L.\""], [136, "128 THE CARYLLS. If this postscript served a little to mitigate the anguish caused by the letter itself, Walter still remained a prey to the bitterest humilia tion. Though alone, he blushed to the roots of his hair when he thought of his careless ness and its consequences. He almost ima gined that Miss Leycester must suspect that he had left the accusing ticket there on pur pose that she might be aware of his munifi cence. In his desperation he might have laid violent hands upon himself, had he not fortunately recollected that the shopman was quite as much to blame as himself, and on him he determined to vent his wrath, a reso lution which was, however, abandoned in his cooler moments. W7hat added to his vexa tion was that Beatrice had given him no ad dress, and consequently he could send her no explanation, nor even implore her forgiveness. There was nothing for it but to submit to his fate, and patiently chew the cud of his discontent. The days passed away very slowly. Walter took to early rising ; he rode every morning or indulged in a sharp pull on the river for an hour or so before breakfast."], [137, "THE CARYLLS. 129 For want of something to do during the day he attended with great assiduity to his official duties ; the nights were spent in one or other of the theatres. His greatest pleasure was derived from his brother's letters, who, pity ing his loneliness, made a point of writing to him at least once a week, and always contrived to find something to say which amused or in terested him. At length came Doncaster races, and Sir Henry Savage was again triumphant. \" Congratulate me, dear Walter,\" wrote Edward. \" I have won a large stake, which will enable me to carry out a plan I have long set my heart on, and which I will tell you when we meet. It was a near thing, however, and only won by a head. On Satur day I go to the Holt, and as soon as Brent ford's election is over I shall return to town. I wish you would engage a lodging for me in a fortnight, somewhere near yours if possible. We shall have plenty to talk over. \" Yours affectionately, \"E. C.\" G 5"], [138, "130 THE CARYLLS. There was even more to be talked over than Captain Caryll had anticipated, for the last fortnight of his absence from London had been prolific of events. The first part of his leave had been passed very pleasantly at Sir Henry Savage's, who, being unmarried, de legated the task of doing the honours of his house to his mother, in which she was ably assisted by two unmarried daughters. The rest of the guests consisted of persons with all of whom Edward Caryll was well ac quainted, and with some on habits of inti macy. Here he remained till Doncaster races gave the signal for the breaking up of the party, and as soon as they were over he went to the Holt, as he had announced to Walter, and where he was anxiously expected by all its inmates. Between Sir Edward Caryll and his eldest son reigned not only affection, but a confi dence not always seen in such near relations. From their earliest youth the younger genera tion of Carylls had been accustomed to look for their best friends in their father and mother. Of the latter they were now de-"], [139, "131 THE CARYLLS. prived, but their father, still unbroken by in creasing age or infirmity, though subdued in spirits, remained unchanged in love for his children and solicitude for their welfare. But of all Edward was undoubtedly the favourite, or perhaps it would be fairer to say, the one on whom his father placed the most reliance, the one who would be the stay and support of his family when he should be no more. As a boy, Edward had been his constant com panion in all his pursuits, and now he began to lean upon him as the staff which was to prop his declining years. His other children were addressed as John or Walter, Lucy or Maud, but Edward was emphatically \" my son.\" This partiality, however, was never displayed in an offensive manner, and the supremacy with which their eldest brother was thus tacitly invested was not only sub mitted to by the others, but acknowledged by them all to be justly his due. Even Louisa, the most self-willed and refractory of the sisterhood, took his admonitions in good part ; and John himself, the self-eonstituted censor of the community, seldom ventured upon"], [140, "132 THE CARYLLS. direct opposition. On the present occasion, all the unmarried members of the family were present with the exception of Walter. Edward arrived at the Holt in the after noon of a fine September day, and found his father and sisters clustered round the old porch to greet his arrival. Maud had been the first to descry the approach of the pony chaise which had been sent to meet him. \" Papa, papa,\" she cried, as she rushed into her father's room, \" ' my son' is coming ; make haste, or you will be too late.\" As soon as the first greetings were over, Edward prepared to follow his father to his study, but Louisa laid violent hands on him. \" This way, Edward,\" she said; \"you are to come to Caroline's room and have some tea. Papa may come too, if he likes; but we mean to have thc first of you, if only to thank you for the beautiful things you sent us from your winnings. Papa must wait ; he is sure to monopolize ' my son' before long.'' \" And where is John ?\" asked the Captain, as he followed his sisters upstairs. \" He said he should be home before this,\""], [141, "THE CARYLLS. 133 replied Caroline ; or, to give her her proper appellation, Miss Caryll. \" I suppose he found more to do than he expected.\" \" I am not easy about John,\" said his father. \" He complains of loss of sleep and appetite, has a nasty cough, and is worn to a shadow. I wrote you word of his ordination last month.\" \" You did, and that Dr. Cox had promised him the curacy. Has he entered on its duties?'' \" Yes ; Cox was only too glad to get him, and in point of fact, has given up the whole care of the parish to him. Between ourselves, I do not think John will have to wait long for the living, for Cox is ten years older than me, and very infirm ; but in the meantime, almost all the work falls upon his curate.\" By this time they had reached the room which was called Miss Caryll's, but was in reality the sitting-room of the three girls ; it was strewn with blue ribbon and favours of every dimension and in every stage of manu facture. \" What on earth is all this?\" said Edward."], [142, "134 THE CARYLLS. \" Ah, you may well ask,\" his father re plied. \"These are to do honour to Lord Brentford ; my good-for-nothing girls are all turned Tories, and what do you think of Maud's making me drive her over to X myself, to buy all this blue trash. If I had stood, it would have been long enough, I am afraid, before they would have made up any orange favours for me.\" \"Now, papa,\" said Maud, \"that is a great deal too bad. You know you told Caroline to make you a large blue favour to wear at Lord Brentford's ball.\" \" Oh, there is to be a ball, is there ?\" asked Edward; \"that accounts for the enthusiasm of these young ladies.\" \" Yes, there is to be a ball ; and, as I promised to take the girls, I shall put on some blue ribbon. One ought always to do honour to a man in his own house in his own way, but I should not be surprised if the blue turned to orange before the end of the even ing. However, as you are here, I think I shall send the girls under your chaperonage, and stay quietly at home.\""], [143, "THE CARYLLS. 135 \" No \u2014 no, papa, you will do nothing of the sort,\" was the unanimous exclamation. \" You promised Lord Brentford, and if you don't go we won't.\" \" Did you ever hear of such tyranny ?\" exclaimed Sir Edward. \" I am regularly chicken-pecked, the worst of all pecking.\" \"And, Edward,\" said Miss Caryll, \"we have kept the dresses you sent us on pur pose; they were too magnificent for anything else. What a fortune you must bave spent on them !\" * I am glad you like them ; as you may guess, I got a lady to choose them. But has this ball been so long in contemplation ?\" \" Ever since Lord Brentford announced his intention of standing,\" said Louisa. \" When he first told us of it, we threatened to send everybody we knew to vote against him, if he would not promise us a ball.\" \" In fact,\" said Sir Edward, \" you will find it darkly hinted at in his address. And mind you find no fault with the address itself, for it was concocted in this very room, and written out at this very table, with the assist-"], [144, "136 THE CARYLLS. ance of the right honourable Caroline and Louisa Caryll, privy councillors, and Miss Maud Caryll, clerk of the council.\" \"And Sir Edward Caryll, Baronet, who looked it over and corrected it,\" exclaimed his daughters. \" That is to say, it was thrust into my hands to read, and I found it so full of bad English and grammatical errors that, in compassion, I pointed them out.\" \" Well, at all events,\" said Edward, \" it does not look as if this election would be the source of much strife or contention. To morrow I will ride over to the Chase, and see how it is all getting on \" John Caryll now walked into the room, and, though somewhat prepared for it, his brother was startled by the change which a few months had made in his appearance. His manner was sufficiently affectionate, if it had not all the warmth which had marked Ed ward's reception by the other members of his family ; but John was one who thought it his duty to repress as much as possible all show of attachment to things of this world."], [145, "THE CARYLLS. 137 He even seemed annoyed when his brother said something to him about his haggard looks. \" My dear Edward,\" he said, \" I am well enough in body, though just now a little tired. Caroline, give me a cup of tea. Pray do not allow my father and sisters to persuade you that I am ill.\" \" I need no persuasion but that of my own eyes ; it is evident that you are overworked, and if you do not take care, you will be laid up altogether. We all need relaxation at times.\" \" We have all of us our work to do,\" John replied, \" and woe to him who does it negli gently.\" \" Have you been a long round to-day ?\" Miss Caryll asked. \"No, not far; but the state of heathenism in which this parish is plunged is enough to dishearten an apostle. Owing to Dr. Cox's culpable indifference and negligence, and what I must consider my father's ill-judged indulgence, there are more dissenters than churchmen amongst the labouring class.\""], [146, "138 THE CARYLLS. \" What would you have me do, John ?\" said his father. \" I would have you tell every man you employ that you insist upon his attending the service of the established church with his family, and discharge him if he refused. I would have you limit your charities to those that do, and above all, I would turn all the refractory out of their cottages, and compel them to seek homes elsewhere. Our task is a hopeless one, if we are not supported by those in authority.\" \" No, thank you, John ; I have never at tempted coercion in religious matters, and I never will. I follow my own rule of faith as well as I can, and leave others to follow theirs. Setting aside its injustice, the history of the world shows that persecution always fails in its object. You must adopt other means of conversion, if you wish to succeed.\" \" But how can dissenters be heathens ? \" asked Miss Louisa. \" I always thought they were Protestants like ourselves.\" \" Better far for them if they were heathens \u2014 they might listen to the voice of truth ; at"], [147, "139 THE CARYLLS. present they are the most obstinate, conceited race on the face of the earth. What do you think of Sally Bacon saying that she would not bring her child to the church to be christened, and actually arguing with me on the necessity of baptism by immersion ?\" \" I suspect, from John's indignation,\" whispered Louisa to Edward, \" that she had the best of the argument.\" \" Did she say,\" asked Miss Caryll, \" if she had received the port wine I told the house keeper to send her ?\" \" If you will encourage \u2014 \" John began ; but his father interposed. \" Come,\" he said, \" we have had theology enough for one sitting. Tell us, Edward, all you have been about.\" The rest of the day passed away peaceably enough. John calmed down, and thanked his brother for the surplice and gown he had sent him, though he could not refrain from a passing remark on the sinfulness of gambling, which was repeated with greater emphasis when Maud produced the cards after tea, and insisted upon a game of vingt et un. His pro-"], [148, "140 THE CARYLLS. test, as might be expected, passed unheeded, and he left the room ; but the door had scarcely closed on him, when it opened again to admit Lord Brentford. He said he was on his return from some canvassing expedition, and had just looked in to see if Edward had arrived, and could only stay a few minutes. But this decision was overruled. His horses were sent to the stable, his groom to the servant's hall, and he himself, nothing loth, was speedily installed at the card table between Miss Caryll and Maud, in whose favour, not withstanding her remonstrances, he instituted a system of cheating on a most gigantic scale. It was past eleven before his lordship ordered his phaeton, after having made arrangements with Edward for coming over to Oakfield on the following day. \" I suppose,\" he said, on taking leave, \" you will not consent to propose me, Sir Edward ?\" \" No, my dear Brentford, I cannot go quite as far as that; but I think I can promise you that I will never propose anyone else.\" \" But you have no objection to Edward's seconding my nomination ?\""], [149, "THE CARYLLS. 141 \" None whatever. He may say, if he likes, that he does it with my full approbation ; and that if we are to be represented by a Tory, I am glad the choice of the County falls on Lord Brentford, the son of my old friend. Your Whig colleague will prevent your doing anything very outrageous, I hope.\" The next few days were passed in all the bustle and turmoil inseparable from an elec- tion, even when uncontested. On the present occasion there were vague rumours of intended opposition up to the last moment, so that it behoved those interested to be on their guard. These reports, however, proved to be without foundation ; and William Oakley, Esquire, commonly called Viscount Brentford, and Robert Sturgess, Esquire, were duly elected as Knights of the Shire for the county of X . Captain Caryll had hitherto hardly done justice to Lord Brentford. That noble lord certainly could lay no claim to genius ; but he was far from deficient in sound, common sense, though, even for this, few gave him credit. As his father had said, he was very"], [150, "142 THE CARYLLS. shy \u2014 painfully so ; and, being quite conscious of this defect \u2014 for with him it amounted to a defect \u2014 he frequently tried to cover it by an assumption of audacity and a flux of words that gave him an appearance of silliness. Now, however, notwithstanding these imper fections, Edward found much to like in him. Thrown together every day in the closest intimacy, he noticed many traits indicative of high principle and a generous disposition, which, under other circumstances, would have escaped observation \u2014 for, after all, it is by the small and seemingly insignificant inci dents of daily life that character is best judged. Perhaps, too, the profound venera tion which Lord Brentford not only professed but evidently felt for Sir Edward Caryll, was not without its effect on his son's judgment, Altogether, he was very agreeably surprised by the discoveries he made ; and warm and sincere were his congratulations to the new made legislator on his triumph, as the latter drove him home from the hustings, where the great event had just been decided. \" Yes,\" said Lord Brentford, \"it is a great"], [151, "143 THE CARYLLS. honour, a great triumph ; but there is yet a greater honour and a greater triumph to which I aspire. Edward, I love Maud, and my most ardent desire is to make her my wife. You will speak a good word for me, won't you ?\" \" Maud ! Do you mean my sister Maud ?\" \" Of course I do. There is no other Maud that I know of. You will not refuse your consent?\" \" My dear Brentford, my consent is very little to the purpose. You had better first secure Lord Isleworth's.\" \" My father's ! Oh ! I told him all about it long ago, and he said I could not do a wiser thing, or one more agreeable to himself than to choose a wife from Caryll Holt. Only he advised me to wait till all this electioneer ing bustle was over before taking any further steps.\" \" And Maud ; is she aware of your attach ment?\" \" Well, I think, I hope she must be ; but I have never yet spoken out. However, now that I am M.P., I mean to lose no more time."], [152, "144 THE CARYLLS. What do you think would be a good oppor tunity ? I was thinking of the ball.\" \" Oh ! that is a point you must settle for yourself,\" said Edward, laughing. \" I can only wish you success, which I do most heartily. What your chances are you probably know better than I do. I can only say that I should be delighted to have you for a brother-in-law.\" \" Thank you, old fellow ; I was in hopes I might reckon on you. Between ourselves, I feel uncommonly nervous about it ; and I almost wish now I had sounded Maud a little more when I had so many chances. It's no joke being refused by a girl one is in love with. If she does, I feel I shall make a fool of myself. I suppose you have no idea how the land lies?\" \" None whatsoever. All I know is that they all seem to consider you as one of the family.\" \" Ah ! that is the worst of it. Perhaps I have lived too much with her on the footino of a brother, for her to look upon me in any other light.\""], [153, "145 THE CARYLLS. \" That does not necessarily follow,\" said Edward. \" And if she does marry you, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that it is with her eyes open, with a thorough know ledge of your good qualities, and of your defects, if you have any.\" \" That's true ; still, I wish it was all settled. By Jove ! here we are. I never noticed that we had passed the lodge.\" VOL. I. n"], [154, "146 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER VIII. Captain Caryll had promised to dine and sleep at Oakfield that night, and assist his friend in doing the honours of their triumph to the numerous party who had been invited for the occasion. No ladies were present, and before the evening was very far advanced, the mirth and clamour grew so boisterous, that he was not sorry to avail himself of Lord Isleworth's suggestion to leave the revellers to themselves, and take a quiet cup of coffee in his lordship's sanctum. Edward guessed pretty well the object of this proposal, and, though not doubting in the least Lord Brent ford's veracity, was not sorry to hear his father's sentiments from his own lips. \" And how did Brentford acquit himself to day in returning thanks ?\" were Lord Isle worth's first words, as soon as they were"], [155, "147 THE CARYLLS. comfortably established on each side of the chimney. \"Remarkably well. There were no attempts at oratorical flourishes or declamation ; but everything he said was to the purpose, and couched in language well adapted to his audience. At times he was really eloquent without an effort, and one or two poetical quotations with which he favoured us seemed to be much admired by the ladies. I need not say that he was well received, and en thusiastically cheered.\" \" Tour sisters and Sir Edward were there, I believe ?\" \" Yes, just opposite the hustings, and my father cheered as lustily as any one.\" \"It is not difficult to guess then whence Brentford derived his inspiration.\" \" Dear Lord Isleworth, I never was more surprised in my life than when Brentford told me of his attachment to Maud. I had no idea of anything of the sort.\" \" Well, it took me rather by surprise, too, when he informed me of it a month or six H 2"], [156, "148 THE CARYLLS. weeks ago, though why it should I cannot tell, for now it seems to me the most natural thing in the world.\" \" And I understand he has your lordship's approbation and consent.\" \" Entirely. I am delighted at the choice he has made. We are rich enough not to look for money, and what we do require, good birth and good principles, he will find united in .A; aud Caryll, if he is fortunate enough to win her.\" \" He has my best wishes for his success,'' said Edward. \" And yet I will honestly confess that I much doubt if I should have said as much a fortnight ago, notwithstanding the great advantages such a marriage would confer upon my sister. I did not do justice to him till lately, in short till we were forced into such familiar intercourse, but now I can fully appreciate his many sterling qualities, above all his uncompromising honesty of purpose. I feel certain that he would not be guilty of a dirty or dishonourable action to save his life.\""], [157, "THE CARYLLS. 149 Lord Isleworth's cheeks glowed with pleasure at this eulogium on his son. \" You are right,\" he said. \" Nothing would tempt him to act in a way his con science disapproved. I do not believe he was ever guilty of a falsehood in his life, even in the most trifling matter. Add to this real goodness of heart, thoughtful and active. That you may know him as he is I will give you one instance. I do not know if you are aware that, when he was little more than a boy, he fell in love with his cousin, Lady Mary Segrave, and proposed to her.\" \" I remember hearing of it at the time,\" Edward replied. \" Well, she refused him, much to my relief, I confess, for I could not have given my consent; she was some years older than him, and altogether I did not think her exactly fitted to be the wife of a very young man. However, Brentford naturally did not view it in the same light ; for a time he felt his dis appointment acutely. Many men would have been piqued, and resented Lady Mary's re fusal, however unjustly ; Brentford, on the"], [158, "150 THE CARYLLS. contrary, not only never uttered a word to her disparagement, but took her defence on all occasions, and never rested till he had persuaded me to call on her and invite her here.\" \" It is indeed very much to his credit,\" said Edward. \" She told me she was coming here, and expressed herself as much pleased at your taking her into favour, to use her own expression, but I do not think she has an idea that she owes it to Brentford.\" \" I forgot that you knew her,\" rejoined Lord Isleworth, \" but I have more to tell you. The other day, when we were talking over various arrangements to be made in case of his marriage, he said that before anything else was done, I ought to make a proper pro vision for Lady Mary Segrave. ' Remember,' he said, ' she is the only child and heiress of the late Earl of Isleworth. Had she been a boy she would have had the title and thirty thousand a year you now enjoy ; as it is, she inherited nothing. This is not right.' To tell you the truth, Edward, I had always had the same sort of feeling, and intended to do"], [159, "151 THE CARYLLS. something, sooner or later, but you know what becomes of good intentions. Well, when Brentford broached the subject, I as sented at once, and asked him what, in his opinion, we ought to offer her, and suggested ten thousand pounds. But he thought it in sufficient. ' Tou ought to treat her like a daughter,' he said. ' You gave Florence twenty-five thousand pounds ; do the same for Lady Mary. You can do it without incon venience, but even if you could not afford it, I had rather be pinched myself for the rest of my days than not do what my heai*t tells me is right.' It was a noble answer, Edward, and made me feel a little ashamed of myself.\" \" It was indeed. And what did Lady Mary say ?'' \" As yet she knows nothing about it. We expect her here before Christmas, and mean to break it to her then.\" \"I wish Maud knew it,\" said Edward. \" She is just the girl to appreciate such an act of chivalrous generosity.\" '.' I cannot allow you to tell it even to her. In fact, I do not think Brentford would like"], [160, "152 THE CARYLLS. ray having mentioned it to you, but I know it will go no further. And now I shall say good night, for I am fairly worn out.\" \" Then my lord, I will say good-bye, for I am off early. I promised to be at home to breakfast to-morrow.\" \" Good-bye then. The day after to-morrow is our ball night, and we depend upon your party for coming early.\" \" You may depend upon our coming early, and some of us staying late.\" \" And, Edward, I wish you would look into the dining-room, and promote a move if you can, for it is nearly twelve.\" \" I will do better; I will insure it. If you will allow me I will ring the bell, and order the carriages and horses to come round.\" \" Do, a capital idea ; only do not let them suppose I had any hand in it. They will be thinking I want to save my wine.\" The bell was rung, and the order given, with strict injunctions to the servant not to say from whom it came ; and then Edward returned to the rest of the guests. The party was not quite as numerous as"], [161, "153 THE CARYLLS. when he and Lord Isleworth had quitted them , for some of the older visitors had taken their departure; but the noise had suffered nothing from their absence ; from boisterous it had become uproarious. When Edward opened the door he found Mr. Morley, a stout, elderly gentleman in top boots and leather breeches, the master of the X hounds, and well known far and near for his devotion through a long life to the sports of the field and his unbounded hospitality, in the act of proposing a health in a speech which appeared to meet with universal approbation. \"He maybe a whig and liberal and what not,\" were the first words that greeted Edward's ears, \"and I am a tory, true blue to the back-bone ; always was, and always shall be. But what of that? D politics say I, when it's a question between gentlemen, and Sir Elward Caryll is a gentleman if ever there was one.\" Here his voice was drowned by vociferous cheering from all parts of the room. When silence was pretty well re-established the orator continued. \" Yes, a real old English H 5"], [162, "154 THE CARYLLS. country gentleman, and by G \u2014 d, if he had stood he should have had one of my votes and my Lord Brentford the other. I have hunted this country these forty year and more, and never knew the Caryll coverts drawn blank yet.\" And exhausted with his eloquence, he sunk back into his chair, till recollecting tbat he had forgotten the motion with which he had intended to conclude, he bounced up again, upsetting a decanter as he did so, and said, \" Mr. Chairman, tbat is my lord, I beg propose good health.\" The toast was drunk with hearty goodwill, and while Edward was returning thanks in terms a little too recherche and sober perhaps for the occasion, the butler came in and announced, to the surprise of the guests, that their carriages were in waiting. Numerous were the enquiries as to who had ordered them at so early an hour, but Mr. Strange, the official in question, who was quite as anxious as his master to see the revel brought to an end, found no difficulty in persuading them that their servants were only obeying orders previously given by themselves. When"], [163, "155 THE CARYLLS. once a move was made the room was soon cleared of all, except those who had been offered beds. It is true, one or two unfor tunate individuals, whose legs failed them just when they were most needed, petitioned hard for a blanket and bolster beneath the dinner table, but they were assured that every article of the sort was already engaged, and being eventually taken up by Strange ancl one or two of the sootmen, they were safely deposited iu their respective vehicles. Extraordinary as it may seem, they all reached home with out any serious accident, although in most instances the drivers were a shade more in the wind than their lords. The master of the hounds, indeed, who insisted on driving him self home in his buggy, by a trifling error in j udgment, missed the bridge in the park, and took the river instead. Fortunately the banks were not steep, nor the water deep, and the good horse, which had not been drinking toasts all night, dragged him in safety to the other side, with no worse result than a thorough wetting to master and man, which,"], [164, "156 THE CARYLLS. however, under the circumstances, they found rather refreshing than otherwise. Mr. Morley, on arriving at home, after divesting himself of his apparel, no easy matter, anxious to avoid disturbing Mrs. M.'s slumbers, sneaked into bed as quietly as possible, but he only put off the evil hour. At breakfast on the following day he was called upon to give a strict account of his actions. His explanations not being deemed satisfactory, the court ordered him to be severely reprimanded, a sentence which was carried out to its full extent on that and many succeeding days. Captain Caryll, on arriving at home, was rather curious to know what sort of effect had been produced on his sisters, or rather on one of them, by the events of the preceding day. The opening was giveu him by his father, who congratulated him on the very favourable impression his new member seemed to have made. \" Your new member, as well as mine, sir. For I think I saw you with a blue favour on your coat.\""], [165, "157 THE CARYLLS. \" All that rogue Maud's doing. I never found it out till I got home, and took my coat off.\" \" And then I hope you did not repent it. Confess now that, for a tory, Brentford made a very creditable appearance.\" \" Very much so. There is more in him than I gave him credit for. I was very much pleased with him, and with you too, master Ned. You both did your work well.\" When Edward was Ned, it was a mark of high approbation. \" Only you were too short, Edward,\" said Louisa. \" Lord Brentford had much better have asked one of us to second him ; we should have found much more to say in his favour.\" \" I will tell him so, that he may know whom to apply to next time. But you must recollect we are very secondary personages on these occasions, and I knew you were all dying to hear what Brentford had to say for himself. I hope you honoured him with your appro bation, as well as my father.\" \"I was delighted with him, and every-"], [166, "158 THE CARYLLS. thing he said. And then he looked so well. I really thought him quite handsome yesterday? which I never did before. He wants strong excitement to give expression to his features.\" \" Oh, I always thought him good-looking,\" said Miss Caryll, \" though, as Louisa says, there is perhaps generally a want of animation. But he was animated enough yesterday ; and what I liked particularly was, that all he said seemed to come straight from his heart, with out premeditation. He spoke as if he was himself convinced of the truth of every word he uttered-\" \"Mydear,\" said Sir Edward, \"you are now describing a great orator. The secret of convincing others is to be convinced yourself.\" \" And you, Miss Maud,\"said Captain Caryll, turning to his youngest sister ; \" have you nothing to say of your old playfellows's per formance ? I will not ask your opinion of his looks, but of his oratory.\" \" That is fortunate,\" Maud replied, blush ing a little, but with an unembarrassed laugh, \" for I could not have answered you. I have never thought more of Lord Brentford's looks"], [167, "159 THE CARYLLS. than of yours or Walter's. I suppose when one sees a person so constantly, personal ap pearance is the last thing one thinks of. And, indeed, I cannot say much more of his speech, for, to tell you the truth, I felt so nervous altogether, that I only caught a sentence here and there.'' \" I should be very sorry to be present at a contested election,\" observed Miss Caryll. \" And I should like it,\" said Louisa. \" If I were well supported by my friends, I should like to be the successful candidate, and triumph over my enemies.\" \" Well done, Loo,\" exclaimed Edward. \" Whenever there is a riot in London I shall send for you to take command of my troop.\" Louisa laughed, and then, breakfast being over, Sir Edward carried off his son to his own room to discuss various matters of business, for he never took any important step in the management of his property without consult ing his heir. At length the important night arrived, on which the promised ball at Oakfield was to celebrate Lord Brentford's triumph. The in-"], [168, "160 THE CARYLLS. vitations had been most numerous, for Lord Isleworth, who was Lord-Lieutenant of the County, had asked every one entitled to that distinction, without reference to political creed. According to promise, the Carylls came early, Sir Edward and his two youngest daughters in his own carriage, followed by Edward and Miss Caryll in a fly which had been hired for the occasion. John was the only absentee, it having been found impossible to beguile him into such vanities. To their great delight they were welcomed by Lady Florence Stuart, who, with her husband, had arrived the night before. \" Papa made such a point of my being here to do the honours,\" she said, \" that it was impossible to refuse, though it was rather in convenient, for we did not intend moving mucli before Christmas. Now we are here, I suppose we sball remain.\" Lord Brentford lost no time in securing the hand of Miss Maud Caryll for the third waltz, lamenting that he was obliged to devote him self in the early part of the evening to per sonages of higher social standing."], [169, "THE CARYLLS. 161 \" In one particular, however, I am very fortunate,\" he said. \" We thought it a proper compliment to my whig colleague, who has so long represented the county, to ask him to open the ball, and Lady Alicia de Bohun, who is my special aversion, will consequently fall to his lot. Never say that virtue is not its own reward.\" \" You will have to dance with her after wards,\" said Maud. \" Not if I can help it. I trust to her being engaged scores deep before I ask her, or what is the use of being a duke's daughter ! You will put up a little prayer on my behalf?\" \" What, that you may be guilty of an in civility ! No, indeed. Besides, it is all very well to talk now as you do of Lady Alicia, but I can recollect the time when you thought otherwise. At least I remember on one occasion, at the last county ball, when you were engaged to me, you threw me over to dance with her.\" \" Oh, Maud, how can you say so ! You know when they found Tonbridge could not come, everybody, and you yourself, said I"], [170, "162 THE CARYLLS. must open the ball with her. I have hated her ever since, and hope never to dance with her again.\" \" My dear Brentford,\" said Lord Isleworth, coming up to them, \" I am sony to interrupt your flirtation, but you are wanted. We have settled that Burgess is to open the ball with Flo, and I have just engaged Lady Alicia for you. They are only waiting for you to begin.\" The dismay depicted on Lord Brentford's countenance at this announcement was so ludicrous that Maud could not refrain from laughing. \" But, my dear father,\" said his lordship, \" Flo cannot take precedence of a duke's daughter.\" \" Yes, but the duke has decided that, as I am father of the member in whose honour the ball is given, my daughter is to have pre cedence to-night. In short, it is all settled, so be off with you.\" \" What amused you so much, Maud?\" said Lord Isleworth, drawing the young lady's arm within his own."], [171, "163 THE CARYLLS. \" Lord Brentford had just been confiding to me his dislike to Lady Alicia, and his hopes that he should never dance with her again.\" \" Poor Brentford !\" said his father, \" I only hope he will be more fortunate in his other aspirations.\" He said it so meaningly that Maud felt there was more intended than met the ear, though she had not the slightest suspicion of what that more was. Still it gave her matter for reflection, and, if the truth must be told, not of the most agreeable nature. She made no answer to Lord Isleworth's observation ; in the next minute her hand was claimed, and her pre-occupation speedily vanished under the influence of the scene in which she was engaged, and her partner's animated remarks. At last Lord Brentford's official duties were concluded, and he was at liberty to prosecute his designs upon Maud Caryll's hand. In general he was rather a loquacious com panion, full of spirits, talking and laughing without ceasing, but on the present occasion he was not only taciturn himself, but, appa-"], [172, "164 THE CARYLLS. rently, the cause of taciturnity in his partner. They whirled round the ball-room once or twice without a word passing between them, when the gentleman suddenly made the dis covery that the room was so crowded, and the heat so intense, that there was no such thing as dancing with any degree of comfort. \" Let us finish our dance later,\" he said, \" when some of our guests have taken their departure. I want to take you into the conservatory. We have had it lighted with variegated lamps, and I should like you to see the effect.\" In the innocence of her heart and unsus picious of evil, Maud assented. She fancied that something had occurred to disturb Lord Brentford's equanimity, and was ready to do her best to soothe his perturbed spirit. To open the way for any disclosures he might wish to make, she said, \" How did you get on with Lady Alicia ? I hope you made her the amende honorable.\" \"Oh, we got on very well. In fact, if I must dance with people I don't care for, it might just as well be with her as with anybody else. Besides, she contrived to soften"], [173, "165 THE CARYLLS. my heart a little, by saying that you and your sisters were the best dressed women in the room.\" \" Oh, how glad I am ! Mind you tell Edward, for our dresses are presents from him.\" \" And she particularly admired the way in which you have contrived to twist that blue ribbon into your hair.\" \" Well, there I do not agree with her. I did not like myself in it at all, but of course, on such an occasion, I had no hesitation in sacrificing my amour propre, and decking myself out in your colours.\" \" Dearest Maud, if I could but persuade you to wear them always !\" \" Wear blue always ! I might as well be vouee au blanc.\" He was in for it now. She either did not, or would not, understand him, and now or never was the time to speak out plainly. They were alone in the conservatory, and it was not likely that he would find a better oppor tunity. \" I was not thinking of ribbons,\" he said,"], [174, "THE CARYLLS. 166 I was thinking of myself. Maud, dearest Maud, I love you, have long loved you. Will you not give me some little hope that I am not quite indifferent to you ?\" \" Oh, Lord Brentford,\" she replied, \" what can you mean? Indeed, I was not prepared for this. What would Lord Isleworth think?\" \" My father ! he knows all, and his most ardent wish is that I may prevail upon you to be my wife. May I not tell him that his wish is heard.\" \" No, no. You must give me time to think. It is so sudden, so unexpected.\" \" Maud,\" he said, taking her unresisting hand, \" you have known me so long; since we were .children together. You used then to say you loved rae; tell me what have I done since to lose your affection, or to make you doubt me.\" \" Oh no, it is not that, but I cannot collect my ideas.

I have asked her to marry me, and she means to be guided by you.\" \" No, no, I did not say that,\" murmured Miss Maud. \" My dear Maud,\" said her brother, \" I can give you no advice one way or the other ; your own feelings must decide on a matter of so much importance to your future welfare. I can only say that, from what I have seen and heard of Brentford, if you like him well enough to marry him, I am convinced you"], [176, "168 THE CARYLLS. will never have cause to repent your decision, and you will give me a brother of whom I shall be proud.\" \" Thank you, thank you a thousand times, dear Edward,\" said his brother-in-law expec tant. \" You are a friend indeed, and I feel that 1 stand sorely in need of one.\" At this hypocritical insinuation Maud could not refrain from casting on him a reproachful look. \" Maud, dearest Maud,\" he continued, \" after what your brother has said, will not your own heart say one little word in my favour?'' And now, bolder grown, he put his arm round her waist. She raised her eyes to his, but, though the word he asked for may have been framed in her heart, her lips refused to utter it. Appa rently it was not needed, for Lord Brentford exclaimed \u2014 \" Oh ! thank you, my own love; how can I ever sufficiently prove my gratitude !\" and then took possession of his prize in a very orthodox manner, without much resistance. Captain Caryll had discreetly turned his"], [177, "169 THE CARYLLS. head the other way, but, seeing some stragglers preparing to invade the conservatory, gave the alarm. \"Now, Maud,\" he said, \"if you do not wish to be the subject of comment and specu lation, take my arm, and you, Brentford, try to slip into the house without being seen. Of course, you will come over to the Holt to morrow, and talk matters over with my father.\" \" Of course. But I must have one dance with Maud after supper.\" f VOL. I."], [178, "170 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER IX. Such was the important information which Captain Caryll had to communicate to Walter on his arrival in London, which took place late in the evening after the ball. His brother had engaged for him the first floor of the house in which he himself was lodging, and there Edward found him installed, waiting his advent. Walter's surprise, on hearing the news, was quite equal to the pleasure he felt at the happy and brilliant prospects opening to his sister. \" For, said he, \" I think I can take upon myself to assert that she is not one to give her hand without her heart. Indeed, I think I may say that of them all.\" \" Of Maud and Caroline, most certainly,\" Edward replied. \" I am not quite so sure about Louisa. She has a strong spice of am bition about her.\""], [179, "171 THE CARYLLS. \"How did she take it?\" \" Oh, very well. But I will finish my tale, for I have not half done. When we were preparing for our return home, Maud asked me, if possible, to take Louisa with me, and tell her ofthe great event. This was managed easily enough. I think, at first, Loo did not quite like the idea of her younger sister being married before her, but, if so, it com pletely passed off before we reached home. We went straight to my father's study, where the others were waiting for us, and Louisa threw herself into Maud's arms, kissing her and wishing her joy with quite as much vehe mence of feeling and language as she used to indulge in, when reprimanding you for your shortcomings in days of yore.\" \" And my father ; what did he say ?\" \" He did not say much. Maud had made her revelation during the drive home, and when we arrived we found the three sitting ou the sofa, holding each other's hands, and I think I could see tbe traces of tears on the faces of all.\" i 2"], [180, "172 THE CARYLLS. \" How surprised he must have been !\" said Walter. \" Not more than all of us, for, strange as it may seem, I do not believe that any one, from my father down to Maud herself, had the slightest idea that Brentford had a preference for one more than the other.\" \" It must have been a very sudden idea on his part.\" \" Not at all, and that is the most curious part of it. Months ago Lady Mary Segrave told me that Brentford had confided to her the fact of his being in love, but she would not tell me with whom. It never entered into my head that it could be with Maud, not even after he had told me of his intentions. I supposed it must have been some other girl with whom he had been flirting, but when I taxed him with fickleness, it came out that Maud, and no other, was the heroine of Lady Mary's tale, and the object of his devotion.\" \" Well, I must say he and his bride are well matched for closeness. Who would ever have suspected Miss Maud of being such a little hypocrite ?\""], [181, "173 THE CARYLLS. \"No, no, not hypocrite. If she kept us in the dark, poor child, she was quite as much in the dark herself. She told Caroline that she had long thought him the most agreeable man she knew, but that till he actually pro posed to her, she had no idea of the state ot her own feelings ; it was only then that she knew how dear he was to her.\" \" Dear little Maud ! And Lord Isleworth approves?\" \" Most cordially. This morning he and Brentford came over to the Holt. The first words he said were, ' Caryll, if we were in the days of Sir Charles Grandison I suppose I should have made my appearance in my coach and six, with outriders, and my servants in state liveries, to make a formal request ot the hand of Miss Maud Caryll for the Lord Viscount Brentford. As it is, I have just cantered over with my son to ask my old friend if he will trust him with the happiness of his daughter.' To which my father replied, ' Willingly, most willingly.

Soon after the two lovers were sent after their own devices, and we remained to discuss the busi ness details. Lord Isleworth went away soon after luncheon, leaving Brentford behind him, and there, for aught I know, he may be still.\" \" It is a great marriage for her,\" said Walter. \" A man she loves, a countess's coronet to look forward to, and fifty thousand a year !\" \" No, not so much as that. Thirty thou sand a year; but Lord Isleworth has always lived within his income, and there are large accumulations. He has behaved most liberally in every respect. Six thousand a year dower, six hundred pin-money, and the absolute dis posal of her own little fortune. He offered Brentford the choice of Oakfield with twenty"], [183, "175 THE CARYLLS. thousand a year, or the house in London with ten thousand, and told him to consult Maud, but they could neither of them hear of it. So it is settled that they are to have five thousand a year, and live with Lord Isleworth in town and country. A much better arrangement, I think, for all parties. Maud even plucked up courage to ask Lord Isleworth what would become of the protection he had promised her, if they were to live separate.\" \" What a comfort my father must find it to have Maud settled so near him,\" remarked Walter. \" I should say that, next to ' my son,' she is the favourite.\" \" Who knows ? I suppose it is contrary to human nature not to feel a preference, but no one ever showed it less than my father.'' \" No one ; and I was wrong to make such an observation, even in joke. And when is it to be?\" \" That is not quite fixed yet, but some time in January, I fancy; when we are all at home. Mind you write to Maud to-mor- \u00bb> row. \" That I will, the very first thing, although"], [184, "176 THE CARYLLS. this time she is in my debt. And now tell me about yourself. What is this plan you want to carry out?\" \" To purchase my majority, Wat, which I have never had the means of doing till now. 1 shall be sorry to leave the Life Guards, though.\" \" But why have you put it off so long? My father would have found the money for you, had you applied to him; and who has a better right to his assistance than his eldest son and heir?\" \" I have no doubt he would, but not with out great inconvenience. I know it cramped him a good deal to purchase my troop for me, and I made up my mind that I never would apply to him again. You know we cannot raise a shilling on the property with out your consent and John's.\" \" No, I did not know it ; but why did you not ask us ? Of my consent you were sure, or ought to have been ; and for such a pur pose John would not have refused his.\" \" I am sure he would not ; but you were in your teens, and consequently it was no use"], [185, "THE CARYLLS. 177 saying anything about it to anyone. Now, I have it in my power to help myself, but I am not the less grateful to you, old fellow, for your offer.\" \" Is my father so very poor ? 1 have no idea of what his property is, or what our future prospects are.\" \" The Caryll property is about three thou- sand two hundred a year. Out of that he gives me four hundred a year, and to you and John two hundred, to the girls sixty. When John gets the living, his allowance will cease, and he will be considered as provided for, with no further claim whatsoever.

But my father has never touched a penny of the interest of this money ; he has allowed it to accumulate for the benefit of his daughters at his death.

Maud, no doubt, is well provided for; but Marlowe is a poor man, and probably will remain so for some years to come; Shoreham is doing well, but he has a large and increasing family ; Caroline and Louisa may never marry, or marry poor men. I do not think it, under the circumstances, an unfair ar- rangement.\" \" I quite agree with you,\" said Walter, \" and, as far as I am concerned, am perfectly satisfied; but I wonder what John will say?\" \" My dear Wat, you are not fair to John ; I grant you he is overbearing and bigotted in some of his ideas, but I believe him to be thoroughly conscientious and convinced of the excellence of his own opinions, and I do not believe him to be rapacious or fond of money. And never let us forget his noble conduct in saving, at the risk of his own life, those two children who fell through the ice last winter. I attribute his present illness to the chill he got on that occasion ; he looks wretchedly, and coughs incessantly.\" \" Yes,\" said Walter, \" it was a brave and"], [187, "179 THE CARYLLS. noble action ; but you would have done the same.\" \" I hope we should both have done the same, but what we would do he has done, and one cannot but reverence a man who has risked his own life to save that of others. If I have not got on with him quite as well as with the rest of you, it is because he never gave me any encouragement, but rather repulsed my attempts to gain his confidence. Perhaps we should have been better friends had he been the eldest, and I the second son.\" \" I am sure I should be sorry for the change,\" said Walter.\" \" But to go back to what I was saying,\" continued the Captain ; \" believe me, John will not take it into his head for a moment to think himself ill-used. He has no reason ; in all probability he will not have long to wait for the living, and that is fifteen hundred a year, with a capital house.

Captain Caryll's stay in London did not exceed a fortnight. His regiment was at Windsor, and he was obliged to rejoin them, but he found time to run down for a couple of days to Rarnsgate, and enchanted the chil dren by giving them each day a sail of some hours. It is true, he met with violent oppo sition from Mrs. Shoreham \u2014 she was sure they would be all drowned, she was sure they would catch cold, or come home sea sick \u2014 but her objections were overruled by her husband. He suffered too much himself to venture out in a boat, but he was delighted at the opportunity of giving his children a new pleasure under so efficient a protector. Lucy was obliged to console herself with watching them through a telescope, as long as they were in sight, and when they were beyond her ken, watching for their return. Unfortunately, on their first voyage she looked the wrong way, and was just beginning to give way to the direst forebodings, when they rushed into the sitting-room, frantic with"], [191, "183 THB CARYLLS. pleasure.

He was personally known to the Commander in-Chief, and Lord Isleworth had given him a letter of introduction, couched in the most pressing terms, to the military secretary, a connection of his own, and with whom he was on habits of great intimacy. Thus sup ported, Edward had no reason to complain of his reception. He received a distinct promise of a cavalry majority, though he was given to understand that, in all probability, a few months must elapse before it would be pos sible to comply with his wishes.

But in this world everything, sooner or later, changes or comes to an end. The week preceding Christmas saw Walter established in his father's house. Of late years he had been there so little, that he felt almost like a stranger in the midst of the sisters who were so glad to have him once more amongst them; but he soon found himself quite at home. Sir Edward received him as fathers are wont to receive their youngest born, the children of their old age, and John pressed his hand with unusual warmth. Altogether Walter felt very happy, happier than he had done for many weeks, and for some time he forgot that such a person as Miss Beatrice Leycester was in existence. He was recalled to his allegiance by Louisa, who, at dessert, told him that she was going to pass a week or two at the Chase. \" In fact,\" she said, \" I was to have gone yesterday, but I would not be the only one of the family absent on the day of your ar rival. And I depend upon you for escorting me there to-morrow ; you will find an old friend to greet you.\""], [193, "185 THE CARYLLS. For the life of him, Walter could not help colouring, as he replied \u2014 \" Is Lady Florence still there ? I shall indeed, be delighted to see her.\" \" Flo is still there ; but I ought to have said two old friends, for I was not thinking of her.

Yes, I used to see a good deal of her when she was staying at her cousin's, Lady Mary Segrave. I thought her a very agreeable girl, but I should hardly venture to call her an old friend.\" \" What a cold-blooded speech !\" said Maud. \" If you are not charmed with her as we are, all I can say is that you are very ungrateful, for she did nothing but talk of Mr. Caryll's good looks and distingui air, his good humour and cleverness. She made quite a conquest of papa, either by singing your praises, or his own.\" \" A little of both, I believe,\" said Sir Ed ward. \" I certainly thought her a very plea sant and well-bred young lady.\""], [194, "186 THE CARYLLS. \" Yes, but I confess she is a little too bois terous for my taste,\" observed Mrs. Shoreham. \" I should be very sorry if Gualdrada were to grow up like her.

He is so shy in general society that few do him justice, but there is more in him than he obtains credit for. In short, dearest Maud, I think him worthy of you ; I could not say that of every one, but in him you may put your trust without fear of being deceived.\" \" Of that I feel quite sure,\" Maud replied, \" for he confessed to me what I suppose few men would have liked to allude to ; I mean"], [198, "190 THE CARYLLS. his proposal to Lady Mary Segrave and her rejection of him.\" \" I am glad he told you of it, for it was a proof of his wish to be quite open and candid with you ; though it was but a youthful fancy, soon forgotten, and which might have been passed over in silence.

Beauty she has no doubt, but it is chiefly of expression ; it does not strike au premier abord, and takes time to make itself felt. And then her manner is so calm and composed ; I might almost say subdued. Perhaps it was from contrast with Miss Ley cester, who came with her.\" \" I certainly should not recognise her from your description,\" observed Walter. \" But no doubt, it must have been a great trial to her, returning to the scenes of her childhood after so long an absence. What painful recollections must have crowded upon her even in this house ! As for Miss Leycester, there is certainly nothing subdued about her. I never saw such high spirits so persistently kept up.\" \" And without an effort,\" rejoined Maud. \" We delight in her ; she is something quite new to us rustics, and took our hearts by"], [201, "193 THE CARYLLS. storm. I wonder you could allow John to attack her as he did without saying a word in her defence.\" \" A quoi bon ? John was only labouring in his vocation, and to defend a person attacked, particularly if the defence is successful, gene rally only serves to increase the violence of the attacking party.\" \" Poor Miss Leycester ! I pity her if she has no warmer champion than you. But tell me something about yourself. How do you like your office and a London life ?\" \" Well, I like them both, I think. I am not overworked, and have just enough to do to make my hours of liberty agreeable. I wish, however, they would give us longer holidays. I should like to see more of you all.\" \" You will see as much of me as you please, when I am \u2014 \" she stopped. \" Come, out with it \u2014 when you are married.

Or at least, have you had no youthful fancies, as you called it in speaking of Lord Brent ford ?\" \" I ! no, indeed,\" he replied, colouring, and with an embarrassed laugh. \" I am not rich enough to indulge in such luxuries.\" Notwithstanding this disclaimer, his manner was such that his sister was convinced that there was more in the background than he chose to avow. The only mistake she made was as to the object. The idea that it could be Beatrice Leycester never entered her head. She fancied that her brother, treading in Lord Brentford's footsteps, had fallen a victim to Lady Mary Segrave's attractions, and her good-will to that lady suffered some slight diminution in consequence. What business had she to cast her spells on men so much younger than herself ; mere boys with out any experience of the wiles of woman kind !"], [203, "THE CARYLLS. 195 CHAPTER X. The following day was good old Christmas weather, with a bright sun and a sharp frost. Louisa Caryll declared her intention of walk ing over to the Chase in time for luncheon, and warned Walter to be ready to accompany her. \" Walk !\" exclaimed her brother, who was not fond of walking, and in London made more use of Hansoms than of his own legs. \" Why, it is a hundred miles, more or less, and how are your things to go; your flounces and furbelows? I dare say my father will let you have the brougham.\" \" Nonsense, Walter,\" said Louisa. \" You don't mean to say that you are afraid of a walk of three miles in this lovely day ! I will tell Beatrice Leycester of you. She thinks nothing of walking over here and back. k 2"], [204, "196 THE CARYLLS. Besides the horse is not roughed, and as for my flounces and furbelows, they will go in the donkey cart.\" There was nothing more to be said. Bea trice's name and example had not been in voked in vain, and Walter yielded with a very good grace. \" Any messages, Maud, for Brentford ?\" he asked. \" None, thank you. He said he should come over in the course of the morning.\" \" What changes you find at the Holt,\" observed Louisa, when they were fairly under way. \" Were you not surprised at Maud's engagement?\" \" Surprised and delighted. I know Brent ford well, and like him. I feel certain that her happiness is in good hands. It is a great thing for her, and indeed for all of us.\" \" Yes,\" said Louisa, \" it is gaining another brother, and I may say another father. Lord Isleworth has given her carte blanche to ask us to London for the season.\" \"And you, I suppose, will be the one to"], [205, "197 THE CARYLLS. profit by it; for Caroline will not like to leave my father.\" \" Oh, Caroline is quite out of the question ; she said so herself when it was proposed to her. And as for me, I have not made up my mind. I dare say you will laugh at me ; but I do not quite like the idea of going out in London under the wing of my younger sister.\" \" Well, Loo, without laughing at you, I think you see it in a wrong light. It is one of the usages of society to which other girls submit, and I should advise you to do the same. It would be of great advantage to you in many respects. However, in this your own feelings must be your guide ; only do not reject such a proposal hastily.\" \" Yes, I know it is foolish on my part, but I will take time before I decide. And how do you think papa is looking ?\" \" I never saw him looking better, or indeed so well ; he is ten years younger than when I was here last. But I cannot say the same of John. He seems to have added as many years to his age as my father has shaken off.\""], [206, "198 THE CARYLLS. \" We are not at all easy about John,\" said Louisa. \" My father wants him to go to London for advice, but he persists in saying there is nothing the matter with him, and gets impatient if we notice his pale looks and his cough.\" \" But his manner is so different from what it used to be,\" replied Walter, \" and in this, at all events, to his advantage. I think I can recollect the time when he would not have taken your assault upon him so good humouredly.\" \" And I can recollect the time,\" rejoined Louisa, \"when I should not have ventured to make it. But the truth is he is much gentler and more forbearing of late than he used to be.\" All further conversation was cut short by their suddenly meeting at a turn of the road another couple who were coming in their direction. \"Brentford and Miss Leycester!\" exclaimed Walter, when his eyes fell upon them. \" In person,\" said the lady. \" Brentford was going to the Holt for some mysterious"], [207, "199 THE CARYLLS. purpose, and I volunteered to accompany him to keep him in order, and for the pleasure of walking back with Miss Louisa Caryll. But as we have met half-way I shall leave him to his own devices, and turn back with you. \" I call that using me very ill,\" said Lord Brentford. \" Why can't you go on, now that you are so far, and pay Maud a visit, and then walk back with me?'' \" Thank you. I suspect Miss Maud had rather have my room than my company while you are there. And to tell you the truth, I think I shall find Miss Louisa a more agree able companion than your lordship. I expected to hear my own praises sung, instead of having to listen to those of another person. I hope, Mr Caryll, you have brought a new and perfectly original set of compli ments with you from London.\" \" If I have not, your presence will inspire me. Miss Leycester made him a very low curt sey, to the great admiration of a donkey and two labourers who chanced to be passing."], [208, "200 THE CARYLLS. \" And now,\" said she, \" let us be moving, for it is no joke standing still in this frost.'' \" And talking of frost,\" she continued, as soon as they were again in motion, \" the gardener thinks it will last some time. Can you skate, Mr. Caryll ?\" \" Yes, I believe I am a pretty good hand at it.\" \" That's delightful. I mean to learn my self, and shall put myself under your tuition. When do you think the ice will be strong enough to begin ?\" With this sort of talk they arrived at their destination, where Walter received as warm a welcome as he had done in his own home. Lady Florence even carried her attentions so far as to insist upon taking him up to the nursery, to be introduced in form to her son, who was enjoying his siesta. She detained him there so long, detailing to him all the various accomplishments which the young gentleman had acquired in the course of the few months of his existence, that Miss Beatrice, on their return down stairs, thouo-ht proper to affect violent indignation."], [209, "201 THE CARYLLS. \" Now, Florence,\" said she, \" you have no right to monopolize Mr. Caryll. He is my sworn knight, and I do not mean to give him up to anyone. If you must have a cavalier servente, take your husband ; it will be much more respectable.\" \" Capital advice,\" said Mr. Stuart, \" I hope she will profit by it.\" \" Not at all,\" Lady Florence replied. \" Those two high offices cannot be held by the same person. Now we have got Walter amongst us, I mean to have my share of him.\" \" Poor Walter !\" said Lord Isleworth. \" If you go on pulling caps for him, he will be left to sing \u2014 How happy could I be with either, Were t'other dear charmer away.\" To give you both a fair chance, he had better stay and dine here.\" But this invitation Walter refused ; they would be expecting him at home, and he thought his father would not quite like his dining out so soon after his arrival. Christmas K 5"], [210, "202 THE CARYLLS. Day fell on the following Monday, and Sir Edward always made a point of keeping it at home, but on the Tuesday the whole Caryll family were to dine at Oakfield, and in this engagement he very willingly included him self. \" You will meet your friend, Lady Mary Segrave,\" said Lord Isleworth ; \" she returns here on Saturday ; and do tell your brother John that I expect him also. I will take no excuse. He might as well be a monk of La Trappe, as lead the life he does.\" Under present circumstances the inter course between the two families, which had always been frequent, was redoubled, and not a day passed without the young people meet ing at one house or the other. Again Walter fell completely into a state of thraldom be neath the influence of Miss Leycester. He was her constant companion, the willing minister of her caprices, which were neither few in number, nor remarkable for their moderation. She had naturally heard much of John Caryll, and what the profane called his eccentricities, but as yet she only knew him"], [211, "THE CARYLLS. 203 by name, and one great object of her ambition was to make his acquaintance, with a view to converting him to the ways of the world. \" It is really absurd,\" she said, \" that I should be so intimate with you all, and not know your brother, even by sight. Positively, Mr. Caryll, you must devise some expedient for bringing it about. I have set my heart upon making him a rational being before I leave these parts.\" But Walter could not, or would not, de vise expedients for bringing them together, or in any way facilitate her plans. Perhaps he wished to spare her the humiliation ot defeat ; perhaps he wished to save his brother from the pain of victory over so fair an antagonist ; or perhaps he had no wish to see another rival near the throne. Be that as it may, for the first time he was contu macious, covering his disloyalty with all sorts of specious pretexts. But Miss Beatrice was not to be so turned from her purpose. Having ascertained that the Revd. John Caryll would preach on Christmas-day in his own parish, and after-"], [212, "204 THE CARYLLS. wards lunch at the Holt, she made her ap pearance in Sir Edward's pew on that day, accompanied by Lord Brentford and Lady Mary Segrave, whom she had beguiled into the service. It so happened that John, having probably in view his sister's approaching marriage, had selected for the subject of his discourse the duty of woman in all its branches, and then, having told them all they ought to do, by an easy and natural transition he passed to all they ought not to do, touch ing with wholesome severity upon some of the practices and habits of the rising genera tion of young ladies. It was not a bad sermon, but rather misplaced, and would have been of more service, probably, if preached in a fashionable London chapel, than in a re tired country church. The party in the manor pew were variously affected by John's eloquence and denuncia tions. Miss Caryll and Maud, recollecting all that had so recently passed on the subject of Miss Leycester's masculine propensities, felt exceedingly uncomfortable ; Walter was in a state of the highest indignation ; Lord Brent-"], [213, "205 THE CARYLLS. ford was entirely lost in contemplation of the charms of his fiance\" e; while Lady Mary could hardly refrain from a smile, as she cast a very meaning look on her friend. The only two who seemed perfectly at their ease were Sir Edward and the young lady herself. The former, to judge by the frequency with which he consulted his watch, appeared to be more occupied with the length than the quality of the discourse, and Beatrice, without manifest ing the slightest discomposure, continued to listen with attention and reverence. \" There, Maud,\" she exclaimed, while tra versing the short distance which separated the house from the church, \"if you are not a paragon of wives, it will not be your brother's fault. I hope he will take Brentford in hand next.\" \" I hate sermons,\" said Walter, with great emphasis. \" The preacher has it all to him self, and there is so much one could say in answer, if one had the chance.\" They were soon assembled in the dining room, and John himself came in ere long. To Miss Leycester he was presented in due"], [214, "206 THE CARYLLS. form, and Lady Mary, to whom he was already known, said \u2014 \"You gave us a most excellent sermon, Mr. Caryll, and I hope we shall all be the better for it.\" \"A very good sermon indeed,\" echoed Bea trice. \" And it is most generous in me to say so, for Mary, and I dare say your brother, will tell you I have all the faults which you so ener getically denounce. If you could have known we were coming, I should have thought that it had been composed for my special benefit.\" John was rather taken aback by this address, and the bright eyes and good humoured smile by which it was enforced added to his embarrassment. He would have greatly preferred being roughly taken to task for his assumption of authority. In that case he would have been at no loss for an answer; now he found himself at fault, but he got out \u2022of the difficulty very creditably. \" I trust, Miss Leycester,\" he said, \" that I should never be guilty of an act so unbecom ing a gentleman and a clergyman as to make any personal allusions from the pulpit. At the"], [215, "THE CARYLLS. 207 same time, if you think any of my observa tions apply to your case, I cannot regret that you have heard them.\" \" It was a capital sermon,\" said Lord Brentford, who had not heard a word of it. \" I have no doubt we shall all be the better for it.\" \" Too long, John,\" observed his father. \"Five and thirty minutes is too much in this weather. Poor old Dr. Cox never exceeded a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes at the outside.\" \" I suppose, sir, you were all better Christians in those days, and did not require so much lecturing as the present generation.\" The conversation continued to roll for some time on social ethics, in which the clergyman naturally took the leading part, speaking his mind very freely. When the visitors rose to take their leave, Lady Mary reminded him that Lord Isleworth folly expected him on the following day, and Miss Leycester told him that, in case he failed to make his appearance, she should apply to Lord Brentford for some of his yeomanry, and come herself at their"], [216, "208 THE CARYLLS. head to carry him off by force of arms. \" Re member\" she said, \" my conversion is only begun.\" \"Well, what do you think of her now, John ?\" asked Maud, as soon as they had left the house. \"As far as I am able to judge, I should say that she is not wanting in candour and good-feeling. That she is good tempered there can be no doubt ; she took all my rebukes in such good part. Pity if so fair a form should be matched with a frivolous mind. She spoke in jest of my having begun her conver sion ; would that I could turn her jest into earnest. Hers indeed would be a soul worth saving. \" I should have thought all souls are worth saving,\" growled out Walter. He quite agreed in the encomium pronounced by his brother upon Miss Beatrice, hut somehow there was an unpleasant sound in the fervour with which it had been uttered. John took no notice of Walter's observa tion, but looked at his watch and left the room. Either he had no reply ready, or he"], [217, "209 THE CARYLLS. did not condescend to discuss such subjects with a layman. \" Upon my word,\" said Maud, \" I really think John is half inclined to fall in love with Miss Leycester. I only hope he may ; I should like her for a sister-in-law of all things. He could carry out his plan of conversion at his leisure, if indeed she did not begin by con verting him to her own views.\" \" Nonsense, Maud,\" said Walter rather sharply. \"You seem to think John irresistible ; that he has only to ask and to have ; but, depend upon it, when Beatrice Leycester does marry, it will not be with a country parson.\" Maud looked at him in some surprise. \" My dear Wat,\" she said, \" I was only in joke, but confess he might go further, and fare worse.\" A new ingredient was thus poured into Walter's cup. He had been quite right when on a former occasion he had denounced himself as being of a jealous disposition, but strange to say, he had hitherto escaped all attacks of that disease. He had seen Miss Leycester laughing,"], [218, "210 THE CARYLLS. talking, and flirting, en tout bien, tout honneur, with all sorts and conditions of men with out an uneasy thought, and now, when it was least to be expected, the grim monster met him in his path. True, no two dispositions could well be more dissimilar than those of his brother and his ladye-love, but how often do extremes meet ! To all he had said, and he had not been sparing in his censure or very fastidious in his phraseology, she had listened with marked attention and respect, without a trace of levity. She seemed to recognize in John Caryll one speaking with authority, and to bow her head in submission before him. How many women there are who reject the timid devotion of the lover to place themselves beneath the yoke of a master ! But on one point he was determined. No further time must be lost. He had shilly shallied long enough. Miss Leycester had had ample time to study him thoroughly, and if she did not like him well enough now to take him for a husband, it was not likely that he would be better off six months hence. To his immense relief John announced that day"], [219, "211 THE CARYLLS. at dinner that he meant to pass the next fort night at Oxford. He considered himself as engaged to dine at Oak field on the following day, but should start the morning after, and only return for his sister's marriage. During his absence Walter made up his mind to try his own fate, on the very first opening that offered. But this opening it might not be so easy to find. There never had been the slightest tinge of tenderness in Beatrice's manner towards him. She was perfectly open and above-board with him as with everybody else. She really preferred him as a companion to all her acquaintance. She was on terms of the most friendly intimacy with him, taking and avowing the greatest interest in all that affected his welfare, and if she had had any secrets to confide would, very likely, have made him her confidant. But in all this there was not a symptom of love, not a par ticle of coquetry ; nothing which could have authorized him to squeeze her hand or pass his arm round her waist. It resembled rather"], [220, "212 THE CARYLLS. the brotherly feeling which may exist between two friends of the same sex. Walter rose the next day, after having passed the night in imagining opportunities for disclosing his passion which were not likely to occur, and framing speeches, which he might never find a proper season for deli vering. It had been settled that he was to go over to Oakfield that morning for the purpose of giving Beatrice her first lesson in skating, and, to save time and trouble, he was to dress there for dinner. Surely in a tete-a t6te on the ice it would be possible to find some propitious moment for opening his heart. He even went the length of contemplating, as one means of extricating himself from his difficulties, the perpetration of the most in fernal piece of treachery which perhaps the mind of man ever conceived. He half re solved to give his pupil a slight push, and, breaking her fall as gently as he could, to fling himself on his knees beside her, and force her to understand by his frantic exclam ations of grief how very dear she was to him."], [221, "THE CARYLLS. 213 It is needless to say that everything turned out differently from what he had hoped and expected. In the first place there was no tgte-a-tete. The whole party went to the lake together. Lord Isleworth and Lady Mary Segrave remained on the banks as spectators, while Lady Florence, excited by Miss Ley- cester's example, put herself under the tuition of her husband. Beatrice herself was in the highest spirits, dressed in the most becoming costume, and looked charming. For a first attempt she did exceedingly well, and after a short time cast off her companion's hand, and insisted upon trying what she could do alone and unaided. In another minute she was lying sprawling on the ice, with Walter beside her, for in the attempt to save herself she had caught at his arm, and brought him down with her. But it was no time for tender speeches or amatory effusions. She went off into such a violent fit of laughter at their joint mishap and the ridiculous figure they both made, that he could not help joining in it, and after a few struggles he succeeded in placing her again on her feet."], [222, "214 THE CARYLLS. \"Are you hurt, Bee?\" asked Lady Florence, who, assisted by her husband, had made her way up to her. \" Oh, I am never hurt, as I was just telling Mr. Caryll. But I think for to-day I have had enough of it, for I am frozen. I am sure 1 shall delight in it when I can skate well enough to keep myself warm. I must have another lesson to-morrow.\" \" Then I will take off my skates too,\" said Lady Florence, \" and we will leave Walter and Alick to get a little warmth into their bodies before they go home. For my part I do not think I shall try it again. It would take so long to skate well, and we have so little frost in the course of the year.\" \" You will not complain of want of frost, Flo,\" said Mr. Stuart, \" if we pass the next winter in Scotland. It is true, the snow generally spoils the skating.\" But if Walter had no particular reason for congratulating himself upon the result of his morning adventures, the events of the even ing were still more unsatisfactory. At dinner he had the pleasure of seeing Miss Leyoester"], [223, "THE CARYLLS. 215 pair off with his brother John, while, he, with Miss Caryll and Louisa, brought up the rear; nor did he find it a sufficient indemnification that chance favoured him with a seat directly opposite to them. They seemed to be com pletely engrossed by their own conversation, and when Beatrice was obliged to answer some observation of her other neighbour, it was done in the shortest possible form of words, and she returned with increased avid ity to the more interesting topics with which her reverend companion was regaling her. Nor was Walter the only one to remark the intense interest with which Miss Leycester listened to every word that fell upon her ear. Maud found time in the midst of her own colloquy with Lord Brentford to throw her brother a very meaning glance, as much as to say, \" You see I was not so far wrong, after alL\" \" By the end of the week,\" said Lord Isle worth, when the cloth was removed, \" we shall be au grand complet, John Leycester comes on Friday, and Edward the day after."], [224, "216 THE CARYLLS.

Have you heard from them lately?\" \" I heard yesterday,\" said Miss Caryll ; \" they expect to be sent to India, but if Cap tain Marlowe cannot get leave in the course of the next two or three years, Fanny means to come over by herself with her three chil dren.\" \" You beat me in grandchildren, Caryll,\" said Lord Isleworth. \" I have but one yet, but he is a splendid fellow for a beginning,"], [225, "217 THE CARYLLS. is he not, Flo ? But to leave grandchildren to turn to something more ancient, I want your advice. I much wish to ask Lady Barbara Oakley here for the wedding, and hardly know how to set about it.

CHAPTER XL The Caryll family were to sleep and pass a couple of days at Oakfield, with the exception of John, who intended to depart early next day for Oxford, and Mrs. Shoreham, whom nothing would have persuaded to pass a night away from her children ; indeed, she had already reproached herself more than once for having been so long absent from them. Tn consequence, the carriage was ordered at a very early hour to carry her and her brother home, and when it was announced the whole party adjourned to the drawing-room. The parting words did not take long, and as soon as the door had closed upon the seceders, Walter made his way to the sofa on which Miss Leycester was seated in pensive silence. \" That is a really good man. Your brother I mean,\" were her first words. Conscience would not allow him to contra-"], [229, "THE CARYLLS. 221 diet her, but to echo her praises was still more impossible. \" He seems to have made a great impression on you,\" was all he said. \" He has ; he has put so many things in quite a new light. And then, though it is easy to see how thoroughly in earnest he is, his manner is so gentle, his words so courteous ; nothing abrupt or overbearing about him. I could hardly believe I was speaking to the same man whom I heard so vehement in the pulpit yesterday.\" \" John has too much good taste to continue professional lectures in the drawing-room,\" observed Walter, who thought he ought to say something. He might have spared himself the trouble, for Beatrice was too much absorbed in her own thoughts to attend to him. After a short silence, she said \u2014 \" I mean to give up hunting after this }3 season. \" Good Heavens !'' thought Walter, \" is it already come to this ! \" \" Is this the fruit of John's exhortations ?\" he asked."], [230, "222 THE CARYLLS. \" It is. He talked of its being unladylike and unwomanly, but that I did not mind ; I have heard the same thing said so often, and always answered it to my perfect satisfaction. But he asked me if I thought my mother would approve of it, if she were still alive, and that opened my eyes at once. Poor mother ! I have not even the comfort of recollecting her, but I have heard so much of her from those who do. She was only three and-twenty when she died ; just my age. My father was shot in a duel at Paris, and that killed her, they say. Had she lived, no doubt I should have been a very different being from what I am.\" She spoke with so much real feeling that it was infectious. \" I, too, have known what it is to lose a mother,\" Walter began, but their further con versation was interrupted by a summons to the tea table, and then Lord Brentford pro. posed a round game. What should it be? \" Oh, vingt-et-un, by all means,\" exclaimed Miss Leycester, who had recovered from her"], [231, "223 THE CARYLLS. momentary fit of depression. \" I adore vingt et-un.\" The cards were produced, and everybody prepared to take their seats round the table. \"Now, Mr. Walter Caryll,\" she continued, \" come and sit by me. And I give notice that for the future I mean to call you Walter tout court. I do not see why I should be the only one present to call you Mr. Walter.

But at breakfast things wore a totally dif ferent aspect from what they had done on the preceding day. There had been a very heavy fall of snow in the night, and it now covered the country to the depth of some inches. \" How provoking,\" exclaimed Miss Bea trice. \" I suppose skating is quite out of the question now.\" \" Quite,\" said the chorus of gentlemen. \" How tiresome ! Just when I was getting on so well.\" But then her thoughts took another direction. \" Oh, uncle,\" she cried, \" have you got a sledge ?\" Unfortunately nothing of the sort existed at Oakfield, but Lord Brentford thought that, with the assistance of the carpenters and blacksmith something might be knocked up as a substitute. Walter undertook to make a sketch of one, and to superintend its construc tion."], [233, "225 THE CARYLLS. \" Oh that is delightful. How long will it take to make ?\" \" I should say it might be ready in the course of the day,\" Lord Brentford replied. \" We will send for the men as soon as break fast is over.\" Walter's was over first, and he at once took paper and pencil to draw his plan. \" What a bitter cold day Mr. John Caryll has for his journey!\" observed Lady Mary Segrave. \" He has indeed, poor fellow !\" rejoined Miss Leycester, in a tone of compassion which made Walter's ears tingle. \" He looks so delicate that I quite feel for him,\" she conti nued. \" Now I will tell you what I will do. I will knit him a comforter against his return, if only to show you all that I can work when I like.\" Something like a shout of derision greeted this speech. \" Yes, a good warm comforter,\" was Bea trice's response to this insult. \" I made one last winter for my old gardener. And, Walter, L 5"], [234, "226 THE CARYLLS. if you are diligent, and get the sledge com pleted in time, we will drive over to X \u2014 \u2014 \u25a0 to-morrow, and you shall help me to choose the lamb's wool.\" This was a little too much. It was insult added to injury, with a vengeance. For a moment Walter felt inclined to throw pencil and paper into the fire, and declare that he would have nothing further to do with it, but a more Christian spirit prevailed, and he went on with his work in dogged silence. And well was it for him that he did. Ere long he met his reward. \" Upon my word, Bee,\" said Lady Flo rence, \" you seem to take so much interest in my old friend John, that I suppose, after providing a comforter for his throat, you will be thinking of his domestic comfort, and provide him with a wife.\" \" A wise !\" exclaimed Miss Beatrice, who was of the highest possible church. \" For Heaven's sake do not put that into his head. I cannot bear the idea of clergymen marrying. They are so much more respectable without"], [235, "THE CARYLLS. 227 wives and families. So much more like the real thing.\" \" The real thing, Beatrice !\" said Lord Isleworth. \" Surely you are not thinking of Catholic priests when you talk of the real thing.\" \" No ; I was not thinking of Catholic priests in particular. I mean any class of men set apart for a particular purpose, to which they devote all their energies, and for which they sacrifice all hope of temporal advantage and comfort.\" \" By Jove, Beatrice,\" said Mr. Stuart, \" you had better not preach such doctrines in public. You would bring about your ears the fifty thousand young ladies who are expecting to marry the twenty thousand young men, who expect to be bishops and deans.\" Walter felt his feelings wonderfully soothed by this discussion. He cast one look at Maud, who did not chance to notice it, and then went on diligently with his drawing; it was soon completed. \"Is that the sort of thing you wish for?\" he said, laying the sketch before her."], [236, "228 THE CARYLLS. \" The very thing ; and so neatly done. Let us set about it directly.\" But before two hours were over, the wind veered to the south, a thick drizzle and rapid thaw set in, and all hopes of sledging or skating vanished. Beatrice's inventive genius was quite at fault. \" Oh, how I wish our romping days were not over, and that we were none of us more than twelve years old !\" she exclaimed. \" What fun we should have !\" There was no help for it, however, and after her grumble, she accepted her destiny with tolerable resignation. The assistance of billiards, battledoor and shuttlecock, and the usual resources of a country house for killing time were invoked, not without success ; while, to her great satisfaction and his sister's inexpressible astonishment, Walter volun teered to walk over to X , a distance of five miles, after luncheon, and procure for her the materials she required for her intended work. She certainly did make some show of remonstrance against his taking so much trouble in such weather on her account, but"], [237, "229 THE CARYLLS. that was easily disposed of. More serious objections came from other quarters ; it would be dark before he could even arrive at X ; he knew his way but imperfectly ; a ten mile walk on such a day as that would be equal to twenty in fine weather; and lastly, he would be drenched to the skin. From the worst of these difficulties he was rescued by Lord Brentford, who proclaimed his intention of accompanying him, and who knew every inch of the way blindfold. Maud, indeed, ventured upon some slight murmurs against this plan, but his lordship was peremptory. \" Some exercise I must have,\" he said; \"it is bad for body and mind, at least for mine, to pass a whole day in the house, and Nep tune wants a walk, tied up in his kennel from morning to night, poor fellow. Besides, it is but right that I should go to take care of my future brother-in-law.\" \" You had better go too, Alick,\" said Lady Florence ; \"you know you will go to sleep after dinner, if yon do not.\" \" What a calumny !\" exclaimed Mr. Stuart,"], [238, "230 THE CARYLLS. rising from his chair and going to the win dow. \" I think the clouds are breaking ; but what will you all do without us?\" \" Upon my word ! What next, I wonder ! Mary, did you ever hear such vanity ? Do you think six women cannot pass a couple of hours without male assistance? But, how ever, we shall have Sir Edward and papa, and with them to amuse us do not flatter your selves that you will be even missed.\" \" I do think your brother the most good natured man I know,\" said Miss Leycester to Maud, as soon as the trio had left the room. \" Most men would have tried to shuffle out of such a job, even if I asked them to undertake it. I should like to see my cousin John's face, if I proposed to him to walk ten miles in the dark and rain to fetch me some worsted. He would think I had a design on his life.\" They were none of them the worse for the expedition. The lamb's wool was approved of, and after dinner Walter was further honoured by being allowed to hold it, while Mis3 Beatrice wound it off, after which the young"], [239, "THE CARYLLS. 231 lady sat down to her work with an assiduity \u25a0which even her adored vingt-et-un was power less to disturb. The next day the task was resumed with equal ardour, and as she threw herself body and soul into every occupation by which she was for the time engrossed, her share in the general conversation was almost limited to monosyllables. \" I never can work and talk at the same time,\" she said. In the afternoon all the Carylls, with the exception of Louisa, returned home, and Walter, with a heavy sigh, was obliged to confess that he was no nearer the goal now than he had been a week ago. It is true that, on taking leave of her, Miss Leycester had been graciously pleased to say that she ex pected him to come over every day to see how she was getting on, but what would that avail him, if all their days were to be spent like the last! The party at Oakfield was soon increased by the arrival of Mr. Leycester. \" Well, old fellow, hooked at last,\" was his first greeting to Lord Brentford. Lord Brentford coloured, and feeling exces-"], [240, "232 THE CARYLLS. si veiy angry at this irreverent way of alluding to his engagement, sought for appropriate terms in which to express his indignation, but Lord Isleworth was beforehand with him. \" If you are speaking of my son's approaching marriage with Miss Maud Caryll,\" he said, \" I am happy to say that he has succeeded in gaining the affections ofthe woman, whom of all others I should wish to see his wife; and in this house, the house of which she will so soon be the mistress, I expect her not only to be treated, but to be spoken of, with the respect that is her due.\" Mr. Leycester, whose object it had always been to get a secure hold on Oakfield, and to stand well with its masters, present and future, was profuse in his apologies. \"I am sure,\" he said, \" Brentford will acquit me of any intention of saying anything that could by possibility be annoying to him, or contain the slightest reflection on his fiancie , whom from all I have heard, I am prepared to admire as much as he could desire. I trust, therefore, he will forgive my unlucky phrase, which I confess was not in the best taste.\""], [241, "THE CARYLLS. 233 His apologies were accepted, and peace was completely re-established. He had always made himself very agreeable to the son, and, till this mishap, had kept strict watch over himself in the presence of the father. Lord Isleworth was quite aware that he was a man of the world, but without attaching any in vidious meaning to the expression ; he had never seen anything reprehensible in his con duct; and he thought that his son, on his first entrance into society, might find a useful guide and councillor in one who was connected with him by blood, and was two or three years older than himself. In consequence, Mr. Leycester had always been a welcome guest in Lord Isleworth's house in London, where he was received on the footing of a cousin; although it so chanced that this was his first visit to the Chase. But there had been another auditor, whom he had hitherto completely overlooked. Miss Leycester was established in a bay-window, making the most of the fading daylight, and working diligently at her comforter. She had heard every word that passed, and, if Lord"], [242, "234 THE CARYLLS. Brentford was angry, she was furious, not only on account of her friend Maud, but ou that of her sex in general. \"Good morning, cousin John,\" she said. \" I hope before you again take upon yourself to lecture me for talking slang, you will endeavour to get rid of a little of your own vulgarity. The idea of a woman hooking a man ! \" I should think a dustman wonld be ashamed of using such an expres sion.\" \"Ah, Bee, are you there?\" said Mr. Ley cester, approaching her. I never saw you. What are you about here ? Working a com forter, I verily believe. For me, of course.\" \" For you ! That you may be able to say I want to hook you, I suppose. No, thank you.\" \" Come Bee, forgive him,\" said Lord Brent ford good naturedly. \" It was a slip of the tongue, for which you see he is truly peni tent.\" \" Eh,je ne my fie pas trop. However, John, there's ny hand. And now give us some news. We are quite starved for want of it.\" Before he could comply with her request,"], [243, "235 THE CARYLLS. Lady Mary Segrave and Louisa Caryll entered the room. \" Mary !\" said Mr. Leycester, while he looked at Louisa with great curiosity, \" This is really a most agreeable surprise. I had no idea I should find you here ; when did you arrive?\" \" Two or three days ago. I have finished my round of visits, I am happy to say.\" \" Will you not introduce me to your com panion ?'' he said. \" Certainly. Mr. Leycester, Miss Caryll.\" \" I did not expect to have the pleasure of meeting you so soon, Miss Caryll. I hope you will allow me to offer you my most sincere congratulations and my warmest wishes for your future happiness.\" \" I suspect, Mr. Leycester, you mistake me for my sister Maud. And though Lady Mary introduced me as Miss Caryll I have no right to that denomination. I am Louisa Caryll.\" \" At all events,\" rejoined Mr. Leycester, \" although congratulations are out of place, I cannot retract my good wishes for your welfare.\""], [244, "236 THE CARYLLS. Louisa and Lady Mary went up stairs to take off their things. \" By Jove, Brentford,\" said Leycester, \" if your bride has half the beauty of her sister, your lines have fallen in pleasant places.\" \" Oh, Louisa,\" said his lordship, \" cannot hold a candle to Maud.\" \" My dear Leycester,\" said Lord Isleworth, \" that is the assertion of a lover, which you will take for what it is worth. But in point of beauty, regularity of feature, and what I may call majesty of expression, Louisa is the handsomest of them all, except, perhaps, Mrs. Shoreham when she was her sister's age. I used to call Lucy my Minerva and Louisa my Juno.\" \" And yet, uncle,\" observed Beatrice, \" there is, to me at least, and I suppose to Brentford, something more attractive in Maud. Something that seems to invite confidence and affection.\" \" Yes; in that she resembles Miss Caryll. Caroline is too quiet and retired to attract observation, but no one has a more pleasing expression. And she has a right to it, for"], [245, "THE CARYLLS. 237 she is the most unselfish person I know. She might have married well, as far as rank and wealth go, but she would not leave her father in his old age.\" Lord Brentford and Beatrice glanced at each other. \" I suppose the gentleman was not to her taste,\" said Mr. Leycester with a laugh. \"Well, upon that point I can offer no opinion, for I was the individual in question.\" \" You, my Lord ! \" exclaimed Leycester, rather taken aback by this candid avowal. \"Yes ; I proposed to her three years ago, with the knowledge and full approbation of my children, and she refused me for the reason I have mentioned. However, I am happy to say it has made no alteration in our friend ship.\" \" Well, all I can say,\" rejoined Leycester, \" is that, be the others what they may, Louisa Caryll is by far the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\" \" Take care, John,\" said Beatrice ; \" you too will be hooked, as you call it.\" \" And if I am to be hooked, to use your"], [246, "238 THE CARYLLS. expression, not mine, for I repented and re nounced it an hour ago, I had rather the line should be thrown by her than by anybody else.\" And certainly to judge by his actions he was perfectly sincere, for he devoted himself completely to Louisa through the evening. \" John,\" said Beatrice, after tea, \" I asked you for news hours ago, and you have never yet condescended to gratify my curiosity. Suppose you begin now.\" \" I don't think I have much news to tell, except what regards myself. I have let Lynburn.\" \" Let Lynburn ! \" they all exclaimed ; \"and why ? \" \" I am sick of the neighbourhood. They are running up mills in every direction, and in another year or two we shall be smothered with smoke. One impudent fellow even pre tends that there is coal in the park, within two hundred yards of the house, and wants to work it. Moreover they have taken a piece of the home-farm for a railway.\" \" Oh, John, you will never consent to such a desecration,\" said Beatrice."], [247, "239 THE CARYLLS. \" They won't ask me, even. They have got their bill, and all I can do is to get as much money out of them as possible. As for the coal, there is already a company formed to take that off my hands. So I have let the house and grounds to a wealthy manufacturer, who is used to smoke, I suppose, and will not mind a coal-pit under his nose.\" \" Poor old Lynburn ! \" murmured Miss Leycester. \" I passed some very happy hours there, when my uncle took me there as a child.\" \" So have I ; but that is passed, and after all it will add altogether something like three thousand a year to my income. II y a de quoi se consoler.\" \" What do you want more money for, John ? You never expend what you have already,\" exclaimed Miss Leycester, indignant at this matter-of-fact way of looking at things. \" Eh ; money is money. One can never have too much of a good thing. Can one, Miss Louisa?\" \" Money is more than money,'' responded"], [248, "240 THE CARYLLS. that young lady. \" Money is power, and in that sense one cannot have too much of it.\" \" Well done, Louisa ! \" said Lady Florence, \" All the aspirations of ambition are concen trated in that one sentence.\" \" Louisa means the power of doing good,\" observed Lady Mary. \" But what do you mean to do with yourself now, John ? Where do you mean to live ? \" \" I want to hire some place in a good sport ing country for the present. Is there is any thing of the sort to be had in this neighbour hood?\" \"Not that I am aware of,\" said Lord Brentford. \" I think,\" interposed Louisa, blushing a little, \" Mr. Birch wishes to let Tuftons. At least, he told my father that if he could find a tenant for it, he should like to go abroad for a few years, till his daughters were grown up.\" \" Where is Tuftons ?\" asked Mr. Leycester. \" Tuftons ! \" exclaimed Lord Brentford. \" It is the very place for you, if it is to be"], [249, "241 THE CARYLLS. had. It joins Sir Edward Caryll's and my father's property, about five miles from here, two from the Holt, and close to a railway station. The house is a charming cottage, standing in charming grounds, with several hundred acres belonging to it. There is capital stabling, and out of the Shires you will nowhere get better hunting. You ought to see about it at once. If poor old Birch does let it, it will be everything to us to have a pleasant neighbour there.\" \"It sounds well,\" replied Mr. Leycester, \" and to-morrow you must put me in the way of making enquiries about it. If I do set up my household gods at Tuftons, I shall not forget that I owe my good fortune to Miss Louisa's suggestion.\" The result of this conversation was that, after some little negotiation, Mr. Leycester took a lease of Tuftons for seven years. VOL. I. M"], [250, "242 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XII. If Mr. Leycester's arrival at Oakfield did not give unmitigated pleasure to all its inmates, the same cannot be said of Captain Caryll, when he made his appearance at the Holt. Walter and his sisters walked to the station to meet him, in which pious pilgrimage they were accompanied by Lord Brentford and Beatrice Leycester, who drove up to the door in that lady's pony carriage just as they were on the point of starting. Sir Edward had declined joining the expedition, but when Miss Beatrice offered to drive him over, he accepted at once. Mrs. Shoreham alone re mained behind to keep watch and ward over her treasures, who eyed the departure of the mission with wistful and envious eyes. It was so long, poor things, since they had had a good splash in the mud ! It is true that Beatrice good-naturedly offered to take"], [251, "THE CARYLLS. 243 Gualdrada between her and her grandfather, but the proposal was declined with a shudder. Had she been asked to let her children pass through the fire to Moloch, Lucy could scarcely have manifested greater conster nation. Captain Caryll had hardly set foot on the platform, when he found himself surrounded by those who were most dear to him, all equally anxious for a recognition. He em braced them all round, and in the hurry and confusion included Beatrice in his salutation, who received it without any seeming dis composure, while the others smiled. \" My dear Edward,\" said Miss Caryll, rather distressed by his inadvertence, \" this is Miss Leycester.\" \" Miss Leycester 1 Good heavens, I am really shocked at my seeming impertinence, but it is so dark here that I took you for one of my sisters.\" u Oh, there is no great harm done,\" Beatrice replied. \"I suppose I ought to have kept more in the back-ground.\" M 2"], [252, "244 THE CARYLLS. \" If you don't like it, Bee, you can give it him back, you know,\" said Lord Brentford. \" Now, Brentford, you had better hold your tongue, or I shall animadvert upon some of your proceedings. I have seen more of them than you suspect.\" Lord Brentford took her advice, and changed the subject. \" What an immensity of luggage you have, Edward!\" he said, as he saw case after case deposited in a van which had been procured for that purpose. \" Luggage, of which I have the charge. Maud will tell you all about it, if you ask her.\" \" You don't mean to say it is the trous seau,\" said Beatrice. \" Something of that sort, I believe.\" \" Then I vow I will not go home till I have seen it unpacked. Sir Edward, will you take compassion on me and give me some dinner ?\" \" With pleasure, my dear. But I think you had better make up your mind to sleep at the Holt. The night will be dark, and you can go home after breakfast, to-morrow.\""], [253, "THE CARYLLS. 245 \" I shall like it of all things. I will send a note by Brentford to my maid, and tell her to send me all I am likely to want. I suppose some one can be found who will bring it, for a consideration.\" \" Thank you, Miss Bee, but I like to see pretty things as well as yourself,\" said Lord Brentford. \" If Sir Edward will give me my dinner, too, we will send a note to the Chase by your groom, and order the brougham to be sent for me, and bring your things at the same time.\" This was the plan adopted, and certainly no one had a better right to see the \"pretty things\" than his lordship, as he had insisted upon providing the bridesmaids with their dresses at his own proper charge. \" And now, my dear,\" said Sir Edward, addressing Miss Leycester, \" we had better think about returning. We have not much daylight left.\" The two started, and the others set out on their homeward walk, Maud aud her lover leading, while Miss Caryll and her two"], [254, "246 THE CARYLLS. brothers brought up the rear. Strange to say, Walter had not taken the slightest umbrage at his brother's aggression upon Miss Leycester. On the contrary, he had been as much amused by it as any one. Had it been John, indeed, who had made such a mistake, his wrath would have known no bounds ; but with Edward it was different. Though a much more formidable rival than John, he could never for a moment feel jealous of his eldest brother, say or do what he pleased. On reaching the Holt Edward went straight up to the nursery, where, at that hour, he was sure of finding Mrs. Shoreham. Their meet ing was as affectionate as ever, though Lucy had a vague uneasy feeling that the children were much more difficult to manage, more rebellious and self-willed, when their uncle was there to aid and abet them than in his absence. She met him at tlie door, and whis pered with anxious earnestness, \" The chil dren are always clamouring to go out. Let me entreat of you not to encourage them. In this weather it would kill them.\""], [255, "247 THE CARYLLS. \" My dear Lucy, set your mind at ease ; but that is not the way in which we were all brought up.\" \" That is what George is always saying ; but you know neither of you are as strong as you ought to be.\" Edward, who was the picture of health, though slightly made, and had never been confined to his bed by illness for an hour, could not refrain from a smile. However, he did his best to quiet her fears. \" Very well,\" he said, \" I acknowledge you as my com manding officer, and will obey orders. And now let me have a look at them.\" His reception by the captives was most uproarious. \" Uncle Edward, uncle Edward!\" they shouted. \" Now we shall have some fun.\" And in fact it was no wonder if they did sigh for a little change.

They had been living, ever since the bad weather set in, in a state of unnatural repression, and hailed the advent of uncle Edward as the harbinger of emancipation. \" What have you brought for me, uncle?\" asked Master Roger, a young gentleman, who had lately entered his fifth year. Miss Gualdrada was shocked. \" You ought not to ask such questions, Roger. Uncle has nothing for little boys who ask for presents.\" Roger began to weep, when to comfort him his uncle said, \" We will see to-morrow what I have got ; but I believe I have something for all good little boys and girls who love their uncle.\" \" Oh uncle, I love you so very much,\" burst from two or three of the smaller fry, who came clustering round him. Captain Caryll laughed. \" After all,\" he said, \" there is no place like a nursery for the study of unsophisticated human nature.\" Lucy was inclined to dispute this assertion"], [257, "249 THE CARYLLS. which, with maternal sensitiveness, she con strued into a reflection upon her progeny, but the dressing-bell put an end to all further discussion. After dinner they all adjourned, with the exception of Sir Edward, to Miss Caryll's sitting-room, to superintend the open ing of the various cases, which had arrived in the van under the care of Edward's servant. Great was the admiration expressed, as each successive article of apparel was displayed to view. Learned and profound were the dis quisitions on the make and material of each by all the ladies present. Innumerable the measurements over the knuckles, for it appears that, by a special dispensation of Providence, every lady's fingers, be they long and taper, or short and dumpy, when it comes to the measuring of silks and satins, are precisely of the same length as her neighbour's. That the articles exhibited met with very general ap probation is certain, but as all the ladies talked at once, and that without intermission, it would be hazardous to attempt to record the individual opinions of each. So overpowering M 5"], [258, "250 THE CARYLLS. was the infection, that even Lord Brentford ventured to hint an opinion upon some par ticular point, but he only succeeded in making manifest his own ignorance and want of taste. He was speedily silenced by a concert of vitu peration, in which I am grieved to say his Maud, his promised bride, bore no undistin guished part. Walter, too, did not fare much better. He had placed himself near Miss Leycester, and, undeterred by Lord Brent ford's ignominious fate, made her some whispered observation, which only elicited a sharp, \" Nonsense, Walter. What can a man know about the matter ! \" In short, the lords of creation were made unmistakably to feel that they were a good deal in the way, and if they were present at all it was merely by sufferance. The Captain alone maintained a discreet silence, listening to Gualdrada's murmured expressions of delight He had forced from her mother a reluctant consent to her sitting up so much beyond her usual hour, and to mark her gratitude the young lady had"], [259, "THE CARYLLS. 251 squeezed herself into the arm-chair occupied by her uncle. \" And what are these three cases ? \" asked Beatrice, when every article of the bride's trousseau had been examined and verified. \"How are they numbered?'' said Maud, looking at them, ancl then referring to a paper a foot and a half long, which she held in her hand. \" Oh, I see ; 21, 22, and 23. These are the dresses for the twelve bridesmaids. It will be better not to open them till to-morrow, as they must be sent off in every direction.\" \" Oh, Maud, one peep, one little peep, if you love me,\" exclaimed Beatrice. \" We need not unpack them to night, but I must see one, just to judge, and I will take mine home with me to-morrow. It is sure to want some alter- ation, and we have not much time to lose.\" Her sisters joined their voices to Miss Ley cester's. \" Please do, Aunt Maud,\" whispered Gualdrada, who was also enlisted in the sacred band, and thus adjured, Maud yielded. The key was produced, the first dress that ca me to hand was taken out, criticized, and finally returned to its resting-place with a favourable"], [260, "252 THE CARYLLS. verdict, and then Gualdrada was despatched to bed, and Miss Caryll summoned the others to follow her down to tea. \" My father must think we are all lost,\" she said. \" Poor dear Sir Edward ! \" observed Bea trice. \" It is a great shame to have left him so long alone. But then one does not get a sight of a trousseau every night.\" They found him very contentedly sitting by the fire, and reading the \"Edinburgh Review.\" \" Well, my dears ; did you find it all right?\" he said, as they gathered round him. \"Perfectly so,\" replied Maud. \"There was hardly a fault to be found with it.\" \" I think, Sir Edward,\" said Beatrice, \" when you see Maud in her bridal attire you will feel quite proud of her.\" \"Do you?\" he rejoined, drawing his daughter to him and kissing her. \" I think I do feel a little proud of her even now.\" The evening passed away rapidly enough. Vingt-et-un, adored vingt-et-un was again had recourse to, but even a natural did not seem to possess its usual attractions. The conversation was rather desultory. \" Vingt-"], [261, "253 THE CARYLLS. et-un, Walter; pay me double. After all, Beatrice, I am not quite sure about that skirt.\" \" You will be bes ter able to judge \u2014 over drawn ! how tiresome !

His last words to Edward on parting were, \" We expect you on Monday to pass the week with us, which you promised us, when you were here before.\" Captain Caryll expressed his perfect acqui escence in this arrangement, which was of long standing. No one offered any objection, and accordingly on the day named he took up his abode at Oakfield, where he soon found matter for reflection in the evident attraction which Mr. Leycester seemed to"], [262, "254 THE CARYLLS. find in his sister Louisa. Somehow, the in habitants of the Chase were broken up into couples. Lord Brentford, it is true, was never at home much before dinner) but Lady Florence devoted herself to her father, Ley cester paired off with Louisa Caryll, Mr. Stuart generally fell to the lot of Beatrice, and Lady Mary Segrave was left, no un willing victim, to the companionship of Captain Caryll. To her he confided his un easiness. \" How exceedingly attentive Leycester seems to be to Louisa,\" he said to her one afternoon during a tete-&-tete ramble; \"and she seems to have no objection to it. What is the meaning of it ?\" \" I suppose it means that they like each other's society better than that of anybody else. I never thought John a marrying man, but I am beginning to change my opinion.\" \"I sincerely hope you may be mistaken, at least as far as Louisa is concerned. I should be very sorry to see her attach herself to Mr. Leycester.\" \" There can be nothing very serious in it"], [263, "255 THE CARYLLS. as yet,\" replied Lady Mary. \" And I think you a little prejudiced against John, for I know Walter dislikes him. I have no wish to uphold him in many of his sayings and doings, and I admit that his manner is at times very disagreeable. But in all respects he seems greatly improved, and there is no saying what the influence of a woman like your sister might effect. I repeat that I do not believe there is anything serious in it at present, but in your place I would let things take their course. Interference in such matters generally makes them worse.\" \" My dear Lady Mary, my conviction is that such a marriage would make my sister miserable. I believe, from what I have heard from many quarters, that Mr. Leycester is a man without heart, or a grain of principle. I am sorry to speak so of your cousin, but I cannot believe in the sincerity, or at least in the durability, of a change effected under sueh circumstances, when the best of us are hypo crites, unconsciously perhaps. With his temper and love of self, and Louisa's pride and high spirit, they would quarrel before the"], [264, "256 THE CARYLLS. month was out. I must speak to her. Tt is my duty.\" \" If that is your feeling I have nothing to say, though I regret your determination, for I still think it injudicious.\" And speak he did. He told his sister how sorry he was to see her giving up her time so exclusively to a man so universally unpopular as Mr. Leycester ; a man who had been guilty of many heartless and tyrannical actions to his dependents, and of whom no one could record one single act of kindness, or gene rosity; whose overbearing disposition and insolent language made him enemies wherever he went. He could conceive no worse fate for a woman than to be the wife of such a man. He spoke very earnestly, and some of his expressions grated on Louisa's ears. But though self-willed and quick of temper, she was an affectionate and higdi-niinded gdrl, and she did full justice to her brother's motives. Suppressing every movement of impatience, she answered with rather an embarrassed laugh, \" In short, you fancy that I and Mr."], [265, "257 THE CARYLLS. Leycester are in love with each other. Pray set your mind quite at ease. Mr. Leycester has never made the most remote allusion to such a feeling, and of myself it is of course needless to speak.

It does look odd, and people will talk.\" \" My dear Edward, who is there to talk, and what can I do ? I walk and talk with Mr. Leycester, because the others are all engaged with their own occupations, and I have no one else to walk and talk with. After all, Mr. Leycester cannot be quite such a vampire as you make him out to be ; he is Brentford's friend, and Lord Isleworth treats him with regard.\" \" Lord Isleworth lives out of the world, and Brentford is still a boy. But if he should propose to you ? \" \" I really cannot suppose anything so utterly improbable.\" \" But probable or not, if he should ? \" persisted Edward."], [266, "258 THE CARYLLS. \" If he should \u2014 La reine s'avisera.\" And she looked like a queen as she said it. Edward could not repress a sigh. \" You forgive me, Loo, if I have annoyed you,\" he said. \"Oh, Edward, can you ask it? I am not demonstrative by nature, but believe me, not one of us loves you better, or appreciates your affection more than I do. As for what we have been talking of I have never thought of marrying, and if Maud were to remain with us, I should never wish for any other home than the Holt.\" Edward left her half reassured, and he thought he could perceive that his warning had uot been totally without effect. Louisa certainly did infuse a little more reserve into her intercourse with Mr. Leycester. In the meantime Walter saw with dismay the hours and days passing away without offering him any opportunity of opening his heart to the lady of his love. In the early part of the next week his sister's marriage was to be celebrated, and would be followed by a general break up of the party. Day"], [267, "259 THE CARYLLS. after day he made his appearance at Oakfield, but never found Beatrice alone. At length, one morning he woke in a state of despera tion, and throwing himself out of bed, knelt down, and made a solemn vow that his fate should be decided that very day. If fortune, ludum insolentem ludere pertinax, still refused to stand his friend, he would make himself independent of her caprices, and boldly request a private audience. Nothing could be worse than this state of suspense ! In accordance with this resolution, he started for the Chase, as soon as he had swallowed his breakfast. Halfway he met Lord Brentford, on his way to the Holt. \" You are well inspired, Walter,\" said his lordship. \" I was desired to send you over with all possible dis patch, for all our men are gone out shooting, and the women, in consequence, are in a state of the greatest possible dejection, for which Bee suggested that you were the natural remedy. I suppose she means to monopolize you herself.\" These words rather tended to raise Walter's spirits, for during his walk his thoughts had"], [268, "260 THE CARYLLS. assumed a very sombre hue, his hopes offering but a very slight and inefficient resistence to his fears. On arriving at the end of his jour ney another inspiring incident occurred, which he was tempted to accept as an omen of suc cess. On the steps of the door he met Miss Leycester herself, alone, and fully equipped for a walk. \" Walter!\" she exclaimed, \" this is a piece of good fortune. I did not expect you these two hours, and meant to get my walk over first. If you do not want to rest, you may have the honour of accompanying me, pro vided you promise to be very amusing.\" Walter assured her that he stood in no need of rest, and explained that he was already half way on his road before he met Lord Brentford. \" Well then, let us start at once. I think the morning so much the best time for exer cise at this time of year.\" Walter quite agreed with her. \" But the others are so lazy, I could not persuade them to come with me. Flo and Mary say they are busy, and Louisa is"], [269, "261 THE CARYLLS. writing to Mrs. Marlowe. I was in despair, for I hate sitting in the house all day, and I am not very fond of fetching a walk by myself.\" \" It is a bore,\" said her companion. \" So there is nothing to flatter your vanity in my saying that I was really glad for once to see you so much earlier than I expected. I was telling my uncle at breakfast that he ought to lose no time in establishing an elec tric telegraph between Oakfield and the Holt. When Maud is married and living here, it will almost be a matter of necessity.\" \" It would be a capital plan,\" Walter ob served. Miss Leycester was at last struck by his taciturnity and monosyllabic replies. \" How silent you are grown,\" she said. \" A penny for your thoughts.\" \" Are you so sure, Beatrice, you would like to know them 1\" She was a little startled by this question, and the tone in which it was asked. How ever she answered boldly, \" Like to know them ! Of course I should; you do not think"], [270, "262 THE CARYLLS. I should have made such an extravagant bid as a penny for them if I did not ?\" He felt that the time was come. \" I was thinking how I could best tell you how very dearly, how devotedly I love you. I was thinking in what words I could ask you to be my wife.\" \" You are not in earnest, Walter ! Dear Walter, tell me you are not in earnest.\" \" As much in earnest as a man can be, whose every hope of happiness depends upon the next words you may utter.\" \" Ah, what have I done ! Forgive me, dear Walter, if by any act or word of mine I have encouraged you in these false hopes, for I can never look upon you in any other light than I do at present, that of a dear and valued friend.\" \" Is there no hope for me, Beatrice ? Can you hold out no hope that in time \u2014 \" \" None, none. If my manner has deceived }-ou hitherto, it would be worse than cruel to continue the deception. But believe me, I had no idea of this. I shall not easily forgive myself.\""], [271, "THE CARYLLS. 263 \" No, no. Yon must not speak in this way. It is entirely my own fault. Not a shadow of blame can attach to you. I should have no one to accuse but myself, even if my vanity and presumption had led me to misconstrue the intimate familiarity of our intercourse. But they never did. If I dared to hope, it was from nothing you have said or done ; but I thought that in time perhaps you might be able to make some little return for the love I feel for you. It was a dream. It is past.\" He spoke so humbly and sorrowfully that she must have been more or less than woman not to have felt some compassion for him. \" My dear Walter,\" she said, \" I do not think I shall ever marry ; at least I have never yet seen the man I would aceept for a husband, and I am three and twenty. I have been my own mistress too long and too com pletely to risk giving myself a master, who might interfere \u2014 \" \" Oh, Beatrice,\" interrupted Walter, \" with me, you must know, you would have nothing of that sort to fear.'' \" Hear me out, Walter. I know I do many"], [272, "264 THE CAEYLLS. things which a husband could not, or at least ought not, to permit. If he opposed or con tradicted me, very likely I should hate him; if he did not, I am sure I should despise him.\" It was not easy to make a satisfactory answer to such reasoning as this, and Walter remained silent. Beatrice continued, \"I know what pain I must have given you, but I thought it best to speak plainly, and the time will come when you will thank me for it, for indeed, I am not fit to be a wife.\" \" Oh, yes, I do thank you for it now, though not for the reason you assign. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the friendly interest you have shown me since I first knew you, but most of all for the kindness with which you have endeavoured to break this blow. It was needed, for I feel very unhappy.\" The tears stood in his eyes as he said it, and his broken voice proved how deeply he felt his disappointment. \" Kiss me, Walter,\" said Beatrice, turning towards him. \" If I cannot love you well enough to marry you, at least believe that, as a friend, no one stands higher in my affection"], [273, "265 THE CARYLLS. and regard. And, dear Walter, for my sake you must strive to overcome your depression, and regain your peace of mind. I feel as if every sigh that escapes from you contains an accusation against myself. And now let us turn homewards.\" They walked on some time in silence. At length, as they approached the house, Miss Leycester said, \" There can be no necessity for letting our friends into the secret of what has this day passed between us, and, if we wish to ward off suspicion, we must endea vour to behave to each other exactly as we have done hitherto. Perhaps you may find it a little difficult at first, but every hour will make it easier. Now come in to luncheon, and begin at once.\" VOL. I. N"], [274, "266 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XIII. If left to himself, Walter Caryll would have gone straight home, without entering the house, but he was still too much stunned to be capable of forming a resolution. He obeyed Miss Leycester's commands mechanically, and before he had time for reflection found himself in the dining-room, where the ladies of the family were just sitting down to luncheon. \" We thought you were lost, Bee,\" said Lady Florence, as the young lady entered the room. \" And there is Walter, I declare. We have been expecting you this last hour, and now it seems Beatrice pounced upon you, and carried you off. Upon my word, I think we ought to enquire into such improper proceed- ings.\" \" How pale and tired you look, Walter,\" observed his sister. \" My fault, I am afraid,\" said Miss Ley-"], [275, "267 THE CARYLLS. cester, coming to the rescue. \" I seized upon him at the hall-door, and never thinking of his walk here, forced him to accompany me on mine. But I will send him home in the pony carriage ; he shall have the honour of driving Gog and Magog, an honour accorded to few.\" \" Oh, I shall do very well after luncheon,\" said Walter, with an attempt at a smile, and filling up a tumbler with sherry, which he took off at a draught. \" I shall do very well, but I am more hungry than tired just now.\" \" Well, sit down then,\" said Lady Florence, good-naturedly, \" and we will all wait on you. What will you have ?\" And then, by one of those inexplicable inconsistencies of human nature a reaction set in : Walter's spirits rose to an extravagant height, and if he had not obeyed Miss Ley cester's commands on starting, to make him self amusing during the walk, he amply atoned now for his previous neglect. But as his spirits rose Beatrice's fell. She could not join in the mirth his jokes and observations excited. She felt almost as if she were wit- N 2"], [276, "268 THE CARYLLS. nessing the efforts of some heart-broken actor to amuse his audience with his quips and jests, while his little child lay dying at home. She noticed, too, with something like alarm, that he, usually so temperate, drank glass after glass without seeming to be aware of it. Lady Mary Segrave was struck by her anxious looks, and partly divined the cause. She rose from the table, and the others followed her ex ample. \" And now I must be off,\" said Walter. \" Wait for the ponies. I will order them in a moment,\" said Beatrice, preparing to leave the room. \"No, thank you, I had much rather walk,\" he exclaimed, following her to the door, and adding in a whisper, \" Let me go now, I implore you ; I can bear it no longer.'' She turned back with him. \" When shall we see you again ? shall you be here to-morrow ?\" asked Louisa. \" Well, yes, perhaps, but not for long. Shoreham comes to-morrow, and of course Lucy will expect us all to go to the station to meet him. John, too, returns to-morrow."], [277, "269 THE CARYLLS. The next day is Sunday. Monday we all dine here. Tuesday you all dine with us, and on Wednesday the great event comes off. Plenty to do in the next few days.\" He departed. Louisa went with Lady Florence, by special invitation, to the nur sery, while Beatrice followed Lady Mary to her own room ; she could not bear to be alone. \" What extraordinary spirits Walter was in,\" Lady Mary observed, when they were comfortably seated over the fire. \" Was he ? He is always in good spirits, but I did not remark anything extraordinary.\" \" Yes, they were extravagantly high ; higher than I ever saw them ; too high to be natural. Beatrice, what passed between you and Walter during your walk ?\" \" What do you mean?\" said Miss Leyces ter, blushing deeply. \" I mean that Walter loves you. I suspect he has told you so, and that you can make him no return. Am I right?\" \" You are, you are,\" she cried ; and then giving way to all the warm-hearted impetu-"], [278, "270 THE CARYLLS. osity of her nature, she flung herself on her knees before her cousin. \" I will tell you all,\" she said, \" but it must go no further, for we agreed to keep it secret, but I am sure he will not mind your knowing it. Only let me tell him myself that I have done so.\" \" Poor Walter !\" said Lady Mary, when the tale was concluded. \" You must be gentle and tender with him, Bee, while the wound is yet green. \" Ah, you need not tell me that. I cannot tell you how grieved I am at having been the means of inflicting so much unhappiness on him. Poor Walter, indeed ! But you may say poor Beatrice, too, for I feel more wretched than I can describe. I had not the slightest idea of such a result of our intimacy. I should have thought that the very openness with which I showed him how much I liked his society must have proved to him that I had no thought beyond. It will be a lesson to me for the future.\" And the tears began to flow, with her an event of very rare occurrence. Lady Mary comforted her as well as she could. \" From what you have told me,\" she"], [279, "271 THE CARYLLS. said, \" Walter absolves you of all blame, and attributes his error entirely to his own blind ness. There need be no diminution of friend ship between you, when he has got over the first shock.\" \" Yes, that is my great comfort, for I really think I like him better than any other man of my acquaintance. Do you know, notwith standing my repugnance to marriage in any shape, I really believe I could accept him, if I thought I could make him happy ; but my conviction is that we should both be miserable before the end of the first year ; and that I will not risk. Do you not think me right?\" \" Quite right, my love. And now dry your tears, and let us look after Flo and Louisa. We must not let them suppose we have any secrets to discuss.\" In the meantime the subject of this conver sation, \" melancholy, slow,\" was wending his way homewards, chewing the cud of bitter disappointment. All the factitious excite ment of the last hour had completely vanished. His only feeling was that all his hopes of happiness, hopes which he had been cherish-"], [280, "272 THE CARYLLS. ing and encouraging for the last six months, were crushed out of his heart for ever; that the life, which he had hoped to pass in the companionship of the only being he could ever love, must now drag its slow length along without an object, without a ray of sunshine to cheer him on his way. And then he recalled with minute precision every word that had passed between Beatrice and himself. It never entered into his head for a moment to blame her, or accuse her of caprice. He even called to mind the words which his brother had made use of when speaking of her months before, and which now he was convinced were intended as words of warning; and he was obliged to admit that his only right to expect a successful issue to his suit was to be found in his own wishes and imagination. In short, he was now brought to the convic - tion, not only that Miss Leycester's feelings for him had never passed the bounds of friend ship, but that she had never given him any reason to suppose that they did. And then with this belief staring him in the face, he would suddenly veer round, and accuse him-"], [281, "273 THE CARYLLS. self of having pleaded his cause with apathy and the coldness of indifferenc e ; with having too easily accepted a first repulse. In her presence he had been tongue-tied, but had he been able to find words in which to express all the ardour and devotion of his passionate love ; could he have persuaded her to listen to all those dreams and plans of mutual happi ness which filled his mind, night and day, perchance she might have relented. And then he acknowledged with a sigh that it was too late now to occupy himself with what might have been ; his only business was with the reality of the present. That he was unhappy, most unhappy, is certain. lie had lost all hope of uniting his fate to that of the woman he loved best upon earth, and he felt in his heart a dreary void which family affections were incapable ot filling. If so derogatory a comparison may be allowed, his state, in this respect, resembled that of one who has lost a valuable tenant, with no prospect of replacing him. Thus, he had every reason to feel unhappy. N 5"], [282, "274 THE CARYLLS. And yet, with all this, before he had entered the park of Caryll Holt, there had arisen, without his being exactly conscious of it, a sensation of relief. In the first place, he knew his fate, and, bad as it was, the uncertainty in which he had been living for some time past was, if anything, worse. Then, though re jected, it had been in favour of no rival. Beatrice had told him that, though she could not marry him, her regard for him was un abated, and he believed her. Every word she had uttered, the kiss she had allowed him to take, were proofs of the affectionate friendship which she still felt for him, and he would endeavour to show himself worthy of it. By the time he had reached his own room his ideas expanded still further. Beatrice had avowed her conviction that she should never marry, and the reasons which she alleged were certainly such as to prove her sincerity. Why should he not follow her example ! It was not so long since he had denounced matrimony on his own account, and, though he had been beguiled into a temporary forget fulness of his principles, that was no reason"], [283, "275 THE CARYLLS. why he should not resume them, now that he was once more his own master. Then in a quiet, unobtrusive manner, he could devote the rest of his days to Beatrice's service, watch over her welfare, comfort her in her afflictions. She would tolerate his attentions, when she found that she had no further annoyance to fear from them, and accept them in the same spirit in which they were offered. It would be a spiritual union, purged of all coarse and sensual passion, such as may be supposed to exist amongst the angelic host. For a brief space he was charmed with the idea. But this state of enchantment did not last long ; it vanished before all the questions put to him at dinner as to the manner in which he had passed the morning. Lord Brentford dined at the Holt, and thought proper to be exceedingly jocose on the state of servitude to which Walter had evidently been reduced by Miss Leycester, and the resignation with which he bore the yoke. \" It is my belief, Walter,\" said his lordship, \" that sbe has selected you for a husband, and is breaking you in beforehand.\""], [284, "276 THE CARYLLS. Maud laughed, as in duty bound, and Mrs. Shoreham said, with something like a sigh \u2014 \" Ah, how I wish what you say in jest may come to pass in earnest. I told Walter in London that Miss Leycester is just the wife for him, but I could not persuade him even to listen to me.\" \" And you will not find it more easy now, I promise you,\" Walter replied. \" And there pray let the matter rest. I like Miss Ley cester's society too well to risk being deprived of it, which would infallibly be the case if your aspirations, Lucy, and Brentford's broader insinuations were to come to her ears. I am convinced that the tenure by which I hold her favour is that I shall abstain from falling in love with her.\" He spoke warmly, and Lord Brentford, who was the most good-natured of men, though somewhat deficient in tact, hastened rather needlessly to explain that he had only been joking. \" In fact,\" he said. \" it is so well understood amongst us that Beatrice has not the slightest intention of marrying for the next twenty years at least, that we are always"], [285, "277 THE CARYLLS. attacking her about her coldness and indiffer ence. I suspect if any man were to make her a proposal of marriage, he would get his ears boxed for his pains.\" \" You must make one exception,'' said Lucy. \" When she drove my father to the station, she made him promise before us all that he would not propose to her en route, as she was afraid she could not find it in her heart to reject him. You should have seen Gualdrada's look of astonishment. Is it not true, papa ?\" \" Quite true, my love. I promised to be upon my best behaviour, and she allowed me to seal the compact by kissing her hand.\" \" Then, Sir Edward,\" said Lord Brentford, \" the least you can do is to drink her health, in which I am sure we shall be delighted to join. For my part, I really love her, though she is about the last woman I should ever dream of falling in love with.\" \" Rather a nice distinction,\" observed Walter, forcing himself to say something. \"I hope Maud understands it.\" After dinner, he took down a book of prints"], [286, "278 THE CARYLLS. and invited Gualdrada and her brother, rather to their astonishment it must be confessed, to place themselves on each side of him and look them over with him. Though good-natured to his nephews and nieces when they came in his way, they rather bored him, and he never encouraged their advances ; but this evening showed him in a totally different light. He devoted himself to their amusement, and when they were talking matters over in the nursery they agreed, nem. con., that uncle Walter ex plained pictures better than papa. The waking in the morning was the worst part of the business. When first Walter opened his eyes, it was with his heart beating violently and a consciousness of ill, which for a few minutes he could not realize. When he did, he felt powerless to struggle against the blow which fate had inflicted on him ; as if his only chance of relief lay in immediate flight from scenes which recalled but too vividly his lost hopes. But this state of depression did not last long. A plunge into his cold bath, on which there was a slight coating of ice, while it set his teeth chattering, acted with"], [287, "THE CARYLLS. 279 most beneficial effect on his mind. He re called Beatrice's appeal to him, and he deter mined to do his best to comply with her in junctions. At breakfast he assumed a cheer ful mien, and, as soon as it was over, invited Miss Caryll to accompany him to Oakfield. \" I do not ask you, Maud,\" he said, \" as I suppose it would hardly be decorous for you to pay Lord Brentford a visit, for of course you would speak to no one else.\" \" Not at all,\" she replied. \" I should like it of all things. I owe Flo, and Lady Mary, and Beatrice a dozen visits, and will pay them now. Besides,\" she added, blushing a little* \" Lord Brentford will not be at home. He pro mised to drive Mr. Leycester over to Tuftons, and they were to start directly after break fast.\" \" All right,\" exclaimed Walter. \" As long as the decencies are preserved I am at your orders. So get your things on as soon as you please.\" \" And mind you are back in time to go with me to the station,\" said Lucy. It was not a bad move on the pait of Mr."], [288, "280 THE CARYLLS. Walter Caryll getting his sisters to accom pany him on this first visit. It certainly took off a great deal of embarrassment from both parties, for though she did put a bold face on it, Beatrice could not help feeling a little conscious. The person who profited most by late events was Lady Mary Segrave, whom Walter had rather neglected during the last week or ten days, but to whom he now re newed his allegiance, though without any appearance of neglecting Miss Leycester. While Louisa possessed herself of Maud, and carried her off to her own room, Miss Caryll followed Lady Florence to inspect the pro gress in size, strength, grace, and beauty made by Master Stuart in the course of the last eight and forty hours. Lord Isleworth, Edward, and Mr. Stuart were out shooting, Lady Mary was busy at the writing-table, and, as soon as she saw the coast clear, Beatrice made a sign to Walter to come to her. \" I have told Mary,\" she said, \" our con versation of yesterday. Indeed, she taxed me with it, and I could not tell a lie. We may trust her.\""], [289, "281 THE CARYLLS. \" Oh, Miss Leycester,\" Walter began. \" My dear Walter, there is no Miss Ley cester in the house but me; and I am Beatrice for my friends. I hope you do not mean to renounce me ?\" \" Better for me, perhaps, if I could.\" \" Now Walter, you have been so good, so forbearing hitherto, that I will not listen to you if you talk in this way. I am going to see what mischief Maud and Louisa are at, and when I come back 1 expect to find you quite reasonable.\" He almost dreaded being left alone with Lady Mary, lest he should have to go over yesterday's scene once more. But on that score he had nothing to fear. She had too much tact, too much good feeling to touch so recent a wound. She saw it was not so much consolation that he required as encouragement and support, and to this she directed all her care and attention. They had no lack of topics for conversation, even when setting aside that which most occupied the thoughts of both, and before their companions rejoined"], [290, "282 THE CARYLLS. them, Walter was talking cheerfully and with interest on the various subjects started by Lady Mary. Beatrice rewarded him with a look of approbation. The shooting party joined them at luncheon. They had left off their sport thus early, as Edward was to return to the Holt in the course of the afternoon. One of the Oakfield car riages had been ordered for the conveyance of himself and his luggage, and the others determined to avail themselves of it and return with him. But before they took their departure there was much to be settled for the programme of the next few days, and Miss Caryll had to remind them more than once that they must never expect to be forgiven if they kept Lucy waiting. \" How tiresome you are, Caroline,\" said Miss Leycester. \" I had so much to say, and now it is quite gone out of my head. Oh, I remember. I had a letter from Brownie,\" thus irreverently did she term her companion, Miss Browne, \" and she says, Maud, that every thing will be in perfect readiness to"], [291, "283 THE CARYLLS. receive you at May Bank, on Wednesday. She herself is going to pass a week or ten days at her brother's in London.\" May Bank was the name of Miss Leycester's abode in Hertfordshire, where Lord Brentford and his bride were to pass the first few days of their honeymoon previous to a visit to Paris. \" And remember, Maud,\" she continued, \" that you are under a solemn engagement to pass Easter with me there, and you must persuade Walter to accompany you, provided he promises to be bien sage. He must have mei-cy upon poor Brownie's weak nerves.\" Walter accepted the condition very readily, and he really felt that he should be able to fulfil it. Beatrice seemed bent upon proving by every means in her power, that, when she offered him her friendship it was no empty form, and in his present frame of mind he determined to do his best to show himself not unworthy of it. He left the Chase with a lighter heart than he had had on entering it. Everything combined to make his present position more easy and tolerable to him than"], [292, "284 THE CARYLLS. he could have supposed possible. The bustle inseparable from such an event as a wedding engrossed a great part of his time, and although thrown perpetually into Beatrice's society, it was almost always in the presence of others; even had he wished it, be would have found no opportunity of recurring to the forbidden topic. As for the young lady her self, to judge by her manner, one might almost have supposed that she had altogether forgotten what had passed between them. She treated him with the same familiarity as ever, putting his services in requisition upon every occasion, entrusting him with all her commis sions, and what he valued more than all, scolding him without ceremony if they were not executed to her entire satisfaction. She contrived to give him so much occupation in one way or another that he had not even time for sighs or lamentations. He was compelled to accept his destiny, as she. had made it for him, without a murmur of discontent.

It was one"], [293, "THE CARYLLS. 285 continued scene of rejoicing and satisfaction loudly expressed, from the Lord Lieutenant of the county and Sir Edward Caryll down to their humblest dependents. Mr. Leycester ceased to be sarcastic or overbearing, and John Caryll, who had returned, joined cheer fully in the festivities which marked the last days of his sister's unmarried life. Peace and good will seemed to have established their reign at Oakfield and the Holt."], [294, "286 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XIV. At length the eventful day arrived which was to unite the fate of Viscount Brentford to that of Miss Maud Caryll. The parish church, in which the ceremony was to be performed, was so close to the Holt, and a January sun shone so brightly, that no car riage was required. Louisa Caryll had returned home the evening before, accompa nied by Beatrice Leycester, who slept at the Holt, to be in readiness to take her place amongst the bridesmaids, twelve in number; for, in addition to herself, the bride's two sisters, and her niece Gualdrada, eight young ladies had been culled from the neighbouring families with whom the Carylls were on the habits of greatest intimacy. The procession, headed by the bride leaning on her father's arm, passed through a double row of tenants and retainers of both families, and on arriv-"], [295, "THE CARYLLS. 287 ing at the church found Lord Brentford and his party already in waiting. The service was read by the Rev. John Caryll in the most conscientious way without skipping a word, while Dr. Cox, who, though unable to stand, was anxious to do honour to his old friend and patron, all of whose children he had baptised, was seated in an arm-chair in full clerical costume, within the chancel. All went on smoothly till the proper time arrived for pro ducing the ring, when Lord Brentford dis covered, to his indescribable dismay and confusion, that though his presents to his bride had been on a scale of lavish magnifi cence and generosity, that diminutive but indispensable article had been totally forgotten. \" My Lord,\" said Mr. Caryll, half closing the book, \" I regret to say it is absolutely impossible for me to proceed without a ring.\" What was to be done? The bridesmaids eyed the bridegroom with scorn and indigna tion ; the unhappy delinquent himself looked the picture of hopeless misery ; the bride turned red and pale by turns, while good* natured lady Mary began tugging at her own"], [296, "288 THE CARYLLS. wedding ring, which of course offered as much resistance as possible. In this dilemma Sir Edward stepped in to the rescue. Drawing a plain gold ring from his finger, he said to his daughter, \" Take this, my love. Eight and thirty years ago I placed it on your mother's finger. May it be to you an omen of happi ness, as it was to us.\" The relief was instantaneous. Every coun tenance brightened, and the ceremony was brought to a successful conclusion without further interruption. But though the new viscountess was quitte pour la peur, her lord did not fare quite so well. The whole party returned to breakfast at the Holt, and there, while waiting till it was announced, Miss Beatrice opened upon him the floodgates of her wit, concluding by a declaration that, if she had the slightest thoughts of marrying, her first act on returning to London should be to make the acquisition of a wedding ring, which she would always carry in readiness, as she found that men were never to be depended on, even under the most critical circumstances. \" Come, Bee,\" said Lord Isleworth, \" Maud"], [297, "289 THE CARYLLS. has forgiven him, so I think you may take him into favour again.\" \" Maud ! I have no patience with her. If she had had a grain of spirit, she would have walked straight out of church, aud left him to be tossed in a blanket by her bridesmaids. I, for one, would have liked no better fun.\" However, having said her say, Miss Ley cester relapsed into a more placable frame of mind, and peace was concluded, on terms honourable to both parties. Lord Brentford, while returning thanks for the healths of him self and Lady Brentford, slipped in a very neatly turned apology for his negligence, which, however, he said, he could scarcely regret, as it had furnished another proof of the amiable disposition of her who had that day blest him with her hand. At length breakfast was over, and the car riage was announced that was to take the new married couple to the station. It was no easy matter for the bride to tear herself away from the embraces of the family who loved her so well, and the friends in the midst of whom VOL. i. o"], [298, "290 THE CARYLLS. her life had been passed ; and when the door closed upon them, and the carriage drove off, a transient feeling of depression seemed to take possession of all present. Mr. Morley, indeed, making a sign to one or two choice spirits of his own standing, sauntered away in the direction of the breakfast-room ; but, to his great consternation, he was intercepted by his wife before he could reach the door, who, whispering certain cabalistic words in his ear, compelled him to retrace his steps with a singularly craven and crest-fallen look. The most effectual proposal for relief came from Beatrice Leycester, who asked Sir Edward if he had any objection to their dancing for an hour or two till their carriages arrived to carry them home \u2014 a proposal most thankfully ac- cepted by the worthy baronet, who insisted upon opening their improvise ball in person with Lady Mary Segrave. The matrons placed themselves by turns at the piano, and it was seven o'clock before the house was cleared of its last visitor. Maud's marriage was the signal for the dispersiou of the family party at the Holt."], [299, "291 THE CARYLLS. The Shorehams departed on the following day with all their belongings. Edward and Walter were to return together to London at the end of the week, and their stay being so short, the greatest part of their time was naturally devoted to their own family. Still, they both contrived to find time for flying visits to the Chase, and almost every day saw one or other of Lord Isleworth's guests at the Holt. Mr. Leycester came once to take leave. He had concluded his arrangements for taking Tuf tons, and was now going to Lynburn to set his house in order there, previous to taking possession of his new abode. During the last fortnight he had certainly come out in a new character, and had shown an anxious desire to be on friendly terms with every member of the Caryll family. Even to Walter he had more than once behaved with great forbear ance, when that young gentleman, yielding to his old feelings of dislike, had made him some petulant reply, or sarcastic remark. Still, the habits of years are not to be overcome, or at all events their traces are not to be obliterated o 2"], [300, "292 THE CARYLLS. in the course of a couple of weeks, and his departure was felt as a relief by more than one of the party. On this particular point, at all events, Walter Caryll and Beatrice Leycester were perfectly agreed. On the last day of Captain Caryll's stay at the Holt, Lady Mary and Beatrice had walked over there soon after their breakfast, to pay a visit, so they said, at least, to Sir Edward and his daughters. Beatrice fancied that the pro posal had originated with her, but I have a strong suspicion that the stone was first set in motion by her companion. They did not stay long, and when they rose to depart, Beatrice said \u2014 \" Now, Walter, if you are disposed to be very gallant, you will accompany us home. We will promise, Sir Edward, to send him back to you directly after luncheon.\" They had not gone far, when Miss Leycester began \u2014 \" My dear Walter, now that we are alone \u2014 for Mary does not count \u2014 I must tell you how deeply I feel indebted to you, and how greatly you have risen in my opinion by the"], [301, "THE CARYLLS. 293 self-control you have exercised during the last few days. I know how difficult it must have been to you ; and believing that it is in a great measure out of consideration to me that you have struggled with your feelings, I thank you for it from the bottom of my heart.\" \" Yes,\" he replied, \" it has been a struggle, and at times a hard one. If I have been suc cessful so far, it is to you, to your kindness, your promise of unchanging friendship, your encouragement, that I owe it. Believe me, I had rather be your friend than the favoured lover of any woman under heaven ; I aspire to no more. And, dear Lady Mary,\" he continued, turning to her, \" you must not suppose that I am ungrateful to you either. Though you have never mentioned the subject, I knew that I was secure of your sympathy, and that also contributed to strengthen me.\" \" I felt that in such a case words could be of no use,\" Lady Mary replied. \" I trusted to your good sense and courage, and I was not deceived. We are proud of him, Bee, are we not ?\""], [302, "294 THE CARYLLS. \"Yes, indeed.\" \" And what are both your plans ?\" he asked, rather abruptly. \" As for me,\" said Miss Leycester, \" I only wait here till my own coast is clear. As soon as I hear the Brentfords have left May Bank I mean to return there, and Mary has pro mised to accompany me. She will stay with me as long as she likes, and the longer the better I shall be pleased. I expect to find my house turned upside down, and inside out, for I suspect a honeymoon is a monstrous dull affair, and that if the bride and bridegroom do not quarrel, they must have recourse to mischief, to while away the time. I only hope Brentford will leave my poor monkey, Hoo doodooana, in peace.\" \" A monkey !\" exclaimed Lady Mary and Walter at the same moment. \" How on earth could you become possessed of a monkey ?\" \" I saw it in a travelling menagerie at Hertford, and it had a little wee baby monkey. They both looked so cold and miserable that I could not help buying them. But the wretch made me pay fifty pounds for them. You"], [303, "THE CARYLLS. 295 should have seen Brownie when I took them back ; I thought she would have gone into fits. Now, however, she is as fond of it as I am.\" \" And what became of the baby ?\" asked Lady Mary. \" Poor little thing, it died in less than a month. I assure you I never saw anything so affecting as the poor mother's patient agony of grief during the last few days of her child's life. Brownie, and I, and my maid used to sit look ing at them, and cry by the hour together for sympathy.\" \" What did it die of?\" said Walter. \" Consumption. Of course I had the best advice I could get for it. Dr. Trevor used to come every day from Hertford to see it. He said from the first there was no hope, but he took great interest in it, and, strange to say, he was the only person its mother would allow to touch it, or take it from her.\" \" I hope she is reconciled to her loss by this time,\" said Walter. \" Pretty well. The first day after baby's death I gave her one of my old dolls, think-"], [304, "296 THE CARYLLS. ing it would amuse her and turn her thoughts, but you never saw such a furious passion as she flew into. She tore it to pieces in a mo ment, and flung the bits at our heads. Now she has a kitten, and they get on very well together. She even seems to take great in terest in Kelpie's education, for she boxes her ears with the utmost gravity whenever the kitten does anything to shock her ideas of propriety. I have sometimes thought of of fering her to cousin John for a wife. She would keep him in order if anyone could ; only he would want too large a dot with her.\" Beatrice Leycester kept her word, and sent Walter back to the Holt as soon as luncheon was over, though the visitor seemed well in clined to linger on a little longer. The next day he and Captain Caryll returned to London. Though they had been living together for the last fortnight, each had been so much occu pied with his own pursuits that they had not seen much of each other, and but little com munication had taken place between them ; now their conversation took a more confiden tial turn. It naturally turned in the first"], [305, "THE CARYLLS. 297 instance upon those from whom they had so recently parted. The inmates of the Holt were first passed in review, and Edward could not forbear from expressing his uneasiness lest Louisa should be tempted to encourage Mr. John Leycester's advances, which in his opinion were sufficiently evident. This was altogether new to Walter, who had been too much engrossed by his own love-adventures to pay much attention to what was going on around him. He endeavoured to controvert his brother's impressions, boldly declaring that it was impossible that a girl, so fastidious as Louisa in her likings, could ever bring herself to tolerate, much less to love such a man as John Leycester. \" My dear Walter,\" his brother replied, \" we all look at others with different eyes, and I do not suppose that Louisa views Mr. Leycester through the same medium that you do. As for toleration, if that is the first step, it is already made. During the week I passed at Oakfield they were inseparable. It is not so much Louisa's falling in love with o 5"], [306, "298 THE CARYLLS. Leycester that I dread, as her being induced to marry him without love, in which case I much fear she would find herself a very miserable woman before the year was out.\" \" Louisa has plenty of spirit and determina tion,\" observed Walter. \" I know no one more capable of fighting her own battles.\" \" What can a woman's spirit and determina tion avail against dogged and heartless sel fishness combined with a domineering and tyrannical disposition ! Mind, I am only speaking of Leycester as I have heard him described ; personally, I have met with nothing but the most courteous civility from him.\" \" Oh,\" said Walter, \" you have heard nothing more than the bare truth about him.\" \"And after all,\" continued his brother, \" even if Louisa were successful in these domestic struggles, would you wish your sister to pass her life in perpetually quarrel ling with her husband ? It would break her heart at last.\" \" Why did not you speak to her, Edward ? You have great influence with all of them.\""], [307, "299 THE CARYLLS. \" I did, but not with much effect. The fact is Louisa is tired of home, and Maud's marriage, besides depriving her of a com panion, has, I suspect, awakened her ambi tion. Leycester is a man of good family, and, Lady Alary says, has at least ten thou sand a year, which he is more likely to in crease than diminish. Therefore, as far as mere wordly prospects are concerned, it would be a good marriage for her.\" \" Has he proposed to her ?\" \" No ; I am sure it has not gone as far as that yet. But he admires her greatly, and when he enters upon Tuftons he will be able to see her every day if he likes. As for Louisa, I do not think she has quite made up her mind whether to accept him or not, if ever it comes to a proposal, but of her ultimate deci sion in his favour I have no doubt. And much as I should regret it, I could hardly blame her, for it must be confessed that those poor girls have not had a merry life of it as yet. I have sometimes wished my father would bring them to London for a few weeks every year, but when I talked to him on the subject he"], [308, "300 THE CARYLLS. said he could not afford it, and as whatever he can lay by will go to them, I felt I had no right to press it. I have my doubts, however, as to the wisdom of his proceedings. I think a little money would have been well spent in giving them the run of society in London for a few >> seasons. \" Maud has no reason to repent it, at all events,\" said Walter. \" No. I consider Maud's happiness secure, as far as that can be said of anyone. But, dear Walter, if I may slightly paraphrase the parable, tlie well-being ofthe ninety and nine sheep w-ill not assuage the grief felt for the one lost.\" They were silent for a short time. At length Walter said \u2014 \" Edward, I have never had a secret from you, and I do not like to begin now. I pro posed to Beatrice, and she refused me.\" \" Ah, has it come to this ! My dear Walter, I need not tell you how truly, how deeply I feel for you. I thought you were attached to her, but I had no idea it had gone so far as a proposal. What courage and self-"], [309, "301 THE CARYLLS. command you have shown to have put so brave a spirit on it. When was it ? Yester day, when you accompanied her home, I suppose, for when you left the Holt together you were as good friends as ever with her.\" \" And so I am still, I am happy to say ; it is some days since I proposed to her, and then she told me that she had no thoughts of marrying, but that I might always depend upon her friendship and regard. It is this conviction and the cordial sympathy of her words and manner which have enabled me to bear the overthrow of all my hopes, for the disappointment was a bitter one. It was not till I had failed that I knew how securely I had reckoned on success. But the worst is over; I know my fate, and submit to it. Beatrice will never marry, nor shall I ; no third person will stand between us, and with that I am content. I am now only reverting to my former determination of living and dying a bachelor. She made me forget it for a moment, and now, as is but just, she has confirmed me in it more strongly than ever.\" Edward could hardly refrain from a smile"], [310, "302 THE CARYLLS. at his brother's vehemence, for he was grow ing rather sceptical as to the value to be attached to declarations of this nature. His reply, however, betrayed no doubt of Walter's firmness. \" I am very sorry to hear it,\" he said, gravely. \" I do not think John likely to marry \u2014 I am out of the question ; and it would grieve me to think that we are to be the last Carylls of the elder branch.\" \" Oh, John will marry as soon as he finds himself in a position to do so,\" Walter re plied, though he did not feel quite easy at the thought which had been suggested to him. The Carylls of the Holt had lived there for centuries, and the idea that it might pass away from them to another branch of the family was distasteful in the extreme. To turn the conversation, he said, \" How much my father seemed to feel losing Maud, which after all, can hardly be called a loss at all. No doubt the Brentfords will pass at least six months out of the twelve at the Chase.'' \"I suppose,\" said Edward, \"he sees in it a further sign of the gradual breaking up and"], [311, "THE CARYLLS. 303 dispersal of the family. The fewer there are of his daughters still left at home, the more he feels parting with each. But I am afraid I am more accountable for his present depres sion than Maud.\" \" You, Edward ! How so ?\" \"I have got the promise of a majority in the 30th Hussars, who have still three years of service in India. Of course, I must join them, and my father has got all sorts of melancholy fancies into his head. I con sulted him before I accepted, and offered to withdraw my application if he had any seri ous objection, but he would not hear of it for a moment. And, as far as I can see, there is no real cause for apprehension. He is sixty-eight, it is true, but he has never had a day's illness. If he would but take more exercise, and interest himself in the manage ment of his property as he used to do, there is no reason why he should not live to be a hundred. After all, I believe my absence will be advantageous to him. He has been so much in the habit of leaving everything to my decision, and now he will be obliged to"], [312, "304 THE CARYLLS. exert himself, and look after his own affairs. He must take example from Lord Isleworth, who is only a few years younger, and who manages everything himself.\" \" Poor father !\" said Walter ; \" I can now understand his low spirits. Put it as you will, Edward, it will be a great loss to him and to all of us. You know we all look upon you as a sort of deputy-father, and what we shall do without you, I know not.\" \" Nonsense, Walter ! To hear you, one might think you were all a brood of unfledged sparrows, dependent on your parents for your daily supply of flies and worms. If such are your feelings, it is high time for me to be off, that you may learn to fly alone.\" \" And when do you expect to be sent off?\" \" Oh ! not these two months ; not before Easter, probably ; and if you require anything to reconcile you to it, remember that for me it is everything. But for my good fortune at Doncaster, I should in all probability have gone on vegetating between London and Windsor to the end of the chapter. Now, I have as good a chance of distinguishing my-"], [313, "305 THE CARYLLS. self as my neighbours. There have been generals in our family before now. Why should there not be another ?\" \" Why not, indeed !\" replied Walter, catch ing something of his brother's enthusiasm. \" If prayers and good wishes are of any avail your success will be certain.\" \"You will see that the Carylls will be something in the history of the nineteenth century,\" said Edward, laughing. \" General Sir Edward Caryll, G.C.B., the most reverend John Caryll, Archbishop of Canterbury, and his Excellency Sir Walter Caryll, Ambas sador to the Emperor of Australia.\" \" I had rather be charge d'affaires a little nearer home. But, talking of John, do you not think when you are gone my father may commit the management of his affairs to him ? I hope it is not disrespectful to say so, but my father is decidedly indolent, and it seems to me to grow on him. He has been so much in the habit of leaning on you that when you are removed he will be looking out for another staff.\" \" No ; in the first place John would not"], [314, "306 THE CARYLLS. undertake it. He told me as much when I hinted at the possibility of my leaving Eng land for some time, saying that his time was more than occupied with his clerical duties, and that to them he was determined to devote himself exclusively. You must try to like John, Walter ; he is thoroughly conscientious, though perhaps not always judicious.\" \" Je ne demande pas mieux\" Walter re plied, \" and indeed his manner now is so dif ferent from what it used to be that I do like him better than I ever thought I should. Every feeling of ill-will to him has long since passed away, and if I occasionally say disagreeable things of him it is the effect of habit rather than the real expression of my thoughts. Flip pancy, in short, of which I will try to correct myself, and I dare say in time I shall feel for him the affection of a brother. Beatrice Leycester, I know, has a very high opinion of him.\" \" Has she ? That shows her sense, at all events. Well, to continue. John, as you see, will not come forward. I took Lucy and her husband into my confidence, and between us"], [315, "307 THE CARYLLS. we have extorted a promise from my father that he will undertake the management of the property himself. If he will but exert him self there is no one who can do it better. Till my mother's death he was his own steward and bailiff, and there is no reason why he should not return to his old habits. It will be good for body and mind.\" \" He is some twelve years older than he was then,\" observed Walter. \" No doubt ; but he means now to promote Baily to be a sort of overseer, and take the hardest part of the work off his hands ; and Shoreham has promised to look into leases and that sort of thing. Altogether he will do very well.\" Before they were aware of it they found themselves in London. The train stopped. Walter returned to his lodgings in Mount Street, and Captain Caryll again took refuge at an hotel."], [316, "308 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XV. Captain Caryll, while talking to his brother, had put as cheerful a complexion on the aspect of affairs as they were capable of bear ing ; but in truth it wras not without a pang that he had made up his mind to so long a separation from all those he loved, and who had twined themselves into his existence. Had he been ten years younger he would have seen nothing but the bright side of things; the monotonous sameness of parades and field-days exchanged for a career of profes sional activity, the chance of distinguishing himself, and the hopes of rapid promotion. But at thirty-two years of age his habits had taken too firm a root to be displaced without a struggle ; his affections were bound up in the home which he was now called upon to abandon for three long years, and he could not but acknowledge to himself that it was"], [317, "IHE CARYLLS. 309 more than probable that of those who would bid him farewell he would not find all alive to greet his return. Still, when once he found he had no opposition to fear from his father, he did not hesitate for a moment. Dreams of professional ambition, which had long since been laid aside, now returned with double force, and he determined to seize the opportunity now offered, and which he might never again find within his grasp. Once a field officer, promotion, however slow, must come at last. But though professional aspirations had much to do with Captain Caryll's resolutions, there was yet another motive which induced him to look upon his absence from England, for a time at least, as desirable. Notwith standing his boasted command over his passions, he had not renewed his intimacy with Lady Mary Segrave with impunity, and the close companionship with her, into which he had been thrown during his week's sojourn at Oakfield, had gone far to revive his youthful attachment. There had been moments in which he was obliged to call all his philosophy"], [318, "310 THE CARYLLS. to his aid, to enable him to refrain from dis closing to her the secret of his heart. Per haps, had there been the slightest encourage ment, or display of sympathy on her part, he would have implored the renewal of those ties which had been so rudely severed ten years ago ; but there never had been the slightest variation in Lady Mary's behaviour. He had himself laid down the boundary of fraternal affection as that to which their mutual regard was to be restricted, and beyond this it was evident she had no thoughts of allowing her fancy to stray. More than once, in his calmer moments, he had shuddered at the thought that he had been on the brink of betraying his feelings, and exposing himself to the well-merited repulse with which his weakness would undoubtedly be met and chastised. Now was the time, if ever, to act upon the principle he had laid down for his own guidance, by renouncing the society of one to whom he felt he was becoming attached. It was a little late in the day, it is true, to have recourse to such a remedy, if tbe object"], [319, "311 THE CARYLLS. was prevention, but if under one system the malady went on increasing, it behoved the patient to have recourse to another. With the best will in the world, and in the present case it was more than doubtful if the good will existed at all, it would be impossible for him to drop all intimacy with Lady Mary as long as he remained in England, without laying himself open to an accusation, not only of rudeness and caprice, but of downright ingratitude. His only safety lay in flight ; an unexceptionable opportunity offered, and even if it were not desirable on other grounds it would be worse than madness not to avail himself of it. If three years spent in India, out of sight of all home recollections, could not cure him, his case must be hopeless indeed. In all probability he would return to find Lady Mary married. Thanks to Lord Isleworth's generosity, she was now rich, and no rich widow or wealthy heiress need remain un- married longer than they desire. During the remainder of his stay in England, he would visit her as he had done heretofore, but with increased caution. Temptation, in whatever"], [320, "312 THE CARYLLS. guise it might be co ncealed, he would sedu lously avoid. He had already made a begin ning, by refusing Miss Leycester's invitation to accompany her and Lady Mary Segrave to May Bank. Nor was Mr. Walter Caryll in a much pleasanter position than his elder brother. As long as he was in Beatrice Leycester's presence, or buoyed up by the hope of seeing her in the course of the day, he had fancied that the private protocol he had drawn up for the regulation of his own feelings would prove perfectly satisfactory, but this was far from being the case when put to the test of absence. Edward left town for Windsor, where his regiment then was, two days after their arrival, and Walter was left pretty much to his own resources, which were of no great depth. None of those with whom he was on habits of intimacy happened to be in town. Lady Mary Segrave, who would have been a host in herself, with whom he could have talked about Beatrice by the hour together, secure of a patient listener, was absent, and the time of her return uncertain."], [321, "313 THE CARYLLS. He was on good terms with his fellow em ployes, but he had no friends amongst them, and even if he had, they would not have been of much use, for he would have felt it like desecration to make them the confidants of his feelings. He belonged to no club ; in the first place, because he could not afford it; and in the next, because he was not particularly fond of the exclusive society of the male sex. In short, he found himself in a state of com plete isolation. A feeling of despondency took possession of him, and at times he doubted whether the Platonic attachment to which he had devoted himself would ever satisfy the cravings of his heart. It might do for angels, but he was obliged to confess that the angelical element was, as yet, but very slightly deve loped in his own organization. Even a dinner at the Brentfords' on their way through London to Paris gave him more pain than pleasure. He rejoiced at the perfect happiness which had evidently fallen to the lot of both ; the happiness engendered by love founded on mutual confidence and esteem ; but p VOL. I."], [322, "314 THE CARYLLS. even while contemplating it, he said to him self with a sigh \u2014 \" This is happiness which I can never hope to enjoy.\" In their presence, however, these melan choly thoughts had no time to expand. There was something so catching in Lord Brent ford's animation that Walter threw off all his cares, and gave himself up to the spirit ofthe moment, as if no Beatrice Leycester existed, or rather as if she had ceased to have any in fluence over his fate, for her name was recur ring at every moment. \" I hope you respected her monkey, Brent ford,\" he said. \" She was rather in a state of trepidation about it.\" \" Of course I did. Miss Hoodoodooana was the only one left to do the honours to us, and I treated her like the mistress of the house. I cannot tell you all the civil things she said to us, and how sorry she was to lose us.\" \" Now, Brentford,\" said Maud, \" you know you were a great deal too bad, and I declare I will tell of you. What do you think, Walter, of his having the monkey brought in"], [323, "315 THE CARYLLS. every day to dessert, and giving it cakes and a glass of wine. One night it was regularly tipsy, and the poor little thing sat all the next day holding its head with its hand.\" \" People generally do get a headache, when they have been drunk the night before,\" Lord Brentford replied, unabashed. \" But I hope, Maud, you do not mean to lay that to my charge. How could I suppose, for a moment, that a monkey, brought up and educated by so decorous and proper a young lady as Miss Beatrice Leycester, would not stop, when it felt it had had as much as was good for it.\" \" I only hope, for your sake, that the very decorous and proper young lady will never hear of it,\" retorted Walter. \"Oh, she knows all about it. I felt cer tain that Mrs Fry, her housekeeper, would send off an express to tell her what had hap pened, so I thought the best thing I could do was to make a clean breast of it in a humble and penitential spirit. I endeavoured to im press upon her that I had only done to monkey what I should wish monkey would do to me, if our cases were reversed.\""], [324, "316 THE CARYLLS. \" You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Brentford,\" said Maud, in what she flattered herself was a tone of stern reproof. \" And what answer did Beatrice make?\" asked Walter. \" She did not even condescend to answer me, but she wrote a furious letter to Maud. Amongst other things she said that it was solely out of consideration to her that she refrained from coming over and horse-whip ping me on the spot. And then she continued, ' How could Brentford be so cruel to my poor little innocent pet ?' If it had been a human being she could not have vented her indignation in stronger language. Bee is cut out for a regular old maid, and no mistake. But, however, I suppose her heart relented to me a little, at least there was a sort of con ciliatory sop at the end of her denunciations, in the shape of a postscript \u2014 ' Tell Brentford, with my love, that his conduct is abominable. I hate him and always shall hate him for it.' The worst of it was that it put an end to Miss Hoodoodooana's pleasuring. I suspect Bea trice sent very stringent orders to Mrs. Fry."], [325, "317 THE CARYLLS. At least monkey was confined to the house keeper's room during the rest of our stay, and all applications for the pleasure of its company were made in vain.\" When Walter was taking leave his brother in-law said to him \u2014 \" Come with us to Paris, Wat; as Maud's guest, of course. It will do you good.\" \" Oh, how I wish I could ! But I am sorry to say it is quite out ofthe question.\" \" Sorry for it, old fellow. Well, good-bye ; better luck next time. At all events, we shall meet again before long; I do not sup pose our stay will exceed a month. I must take my seat, and I mean to set Maud to work to compose my maiden speech.\" As he walked home, Walter's thoughts naturally dwelt upon the scene he had just left, which strengthened his growing convic tion that happiness, if ever attainable by man, is only to be found in the married state. It was in such a scene that, till the spell had been broken, he had for months fondly hoped that, sooner or later, he would play a part. p 3"], [326, "318 THE CARYLLS. Now he felt that he had to begin life over again, but life bereft of all its brightest hopes and dreams. His thoughts reverted to Ed ward ; he thought he could discern something similar in their fates, and from this fancied similarity he derived a sort of negative com fort. Edward, deserted by the woman he loved, had nevertheless struggled, and, to all appearance, struggled successfully, against his disappointment. Should he show less courage, and break down under a trial infi nitely less severe ! Active occupation of mind or body was what he required. He felt it, but how to obtain it he knew not. Could he but have accepted Lord Brentford's offer, and accom panied them to Paris, in his present frame of mind, it would have been everything to him. It would have given a totally different direc tion to his thoughts, and perhaps the chain, once broken, would no longer gall. Beatrice would ever be the object of his dearest affec tions, his friend, his sister, but the feelings with which he regarded her would be chas tened and purified, and need no longer mar"], [327, "319 THE CARYLLS. his existence. But to leave London at pre sent was impossible ; he was chained to the oar, and would be so for some time to come. At one moment he thought of applying for the place of Queen's messenger. That, at all events, would give him active employ ment enough; but, in the first place, he was by no means sure how Sir Edward would approve of such a career for his son ; and, in the next, he felt that once a messenger, a messenger he must remain, till incapacitated by age or infirmity. To rush about from one capital to another would form the Be-all and the End-all of his existence, and he was still too young to relinquish all hopes of rising in the world. To get rid of the wearisome thoughts which sometimes pressed upon him with a persist ency which was almost intolerable, he favoured the Shorehams with more of his company than he had hitherto been in the habit of do ing. He dined with them frequently, and occasionally dropped in at rather a later hour in the evening than was quite agreeable to Lucy's orderly habits. But, with his newly"], [328, "320 THE CARYLLS. acquired predilections for married life, he began to take an interest in his sister's nu merous progeny, and in favour of this dis position, she overlooked the irregularity of his proceedings. His eldest niece found special favour in his eyes, aud in truth, Gualdrada was a most attractive child, not only for her beauty and endearing manners, but for her intelligence, which was far beyond her years. Nor was she backward in culti vating her uncle's good-will. Whenever he made his appearance, she was the first to greet him with loud expressions of joy, and eagerly accepted his invitation to share the arm-chair in which he installed himself, tak ing possession of his hand, and responding to all his caresses. These were the happiest moments of his life, ancl he thought that, if be had such a being to tend and cherish, he should require nothing more ; with such an auxiliary he could dispense with the more doubtful blessing of a wife. Once this hallucination went so far that, half in jest, half in earnest, he proposed to adopt his niece, and take complete charge of"], [329, "321 THE CARYLLS. her future existence. Mr. Shoreham treated it as a capital joke. \" An excellent idea,\" he said ; \" I only wish we could find an uncle to take charge of all the others. I think, however, we shall be entitled to a handsome premium.\" But Lucy could not take a jocose view of the proposal; she treated it with the utmost gravity as a most audacious attempt to de prive her of her eldest born. \" Nonsense, George,\" she exclaimed ; \"how can you suppose for a moment that I would consent to anything of the sort. It would be like selling my own flesh and blood !\" \"My dear,\" said Mr. Shoreham, \"you ap pear to me to be in a strange state of ignor ance as to the extent of my marital and paternal rights. Your consent would not be needed ; I have absolute and uncontrolled power over the disposal of my offspring, short of putting them to death. Perhaps I have not a legal right to sell them as slaves, but this is easily evaded by calling them appren tices.\" \" If that is the law, which I don't believe,"], [330, "322 THE CARYLLS. more shame for those who made it. I, for one, should set it at defiance. And to give her up to Walter ! How would he be able to maintain her, when he has hardly enough to maintain himself, poor fellow ?\" \" Ah true, I forgot that part ofthe business, and if he cannot maintain her, he would be still less able to pay a premium ; so there is an end of it. I am sorry for it, Walter, but till you are Under-Secretary of State at least, we cannot give up Gualdrada to you. Perhaps one of the smaller ones \u2014 \" \" Now, George,\" said his wife, \" say no more about it. Walter will not have any of them. If he wants to have children about him, let him marry. He. ought to have taken my advice about Beatrice Leycester.\" The pecuniary difficulty started by Lucy Shoreham, strange to say, had uever presented itself to Walter's mind, but now he was com pelled to acknowledge its justice, and another insuperable bar to domestic happiness raised its head. What right had he to expect any parents to give up their child to poverty and destitution. All hope of Beatrice being at an"], [331, "323 THE CARYLLS. end, marriage, of course, was out of the ques- tion. If he had not actually taken a vow of celibacy, his mind was irrevocably made up on the subject ; and yet it gave him a pang of humiliation to feel that, were he reduced to the necessity of taking a wife, he was not in a position to make an independent choice. He must necessarily select her from amongst those who were sufficiently well-endowed by fortune to make good his own deficiencies in that respect. \" If I had but some one to love ; some one whom I could call my own ! \" he muttered to himself as he was crossing the park on his return from Kensington. \" But that is denied me. Ah, Beatrice, why would you not give me a chance ! My love, my devotion must ere long have forced you to make me some return.\" He had already passed the head of the Serpen tine, and was gesticulating with considerable vehemence, when he overtook a young woman going in the same direction, who quickened her pace as he passed her, as if desirous of accosting him. \" Did you wish to speak to me? \" he asked,"], [332, "324 THE CARYLLS. stopping for a moment to allow her to come up to him. \" No, sir. But it is so dark, and the Park is so lonely, that I thought I would try to keep near you, as far as our ways lie together towards Oxford-street.\" \" And I was going a little too fast for you,\" he said good-naturedly. \" But I am in no hurry, and shall have great pleasure in escort ing you as far as the Marble Arch ; for it is rather too late for a young lady to cross the Park without a protector.\" \"It is ; but my mother was not able to come with me this evening. I made sure of getting home by the omnibus, but they were all full.\" \" Oh, that is always the case when one wants them.\" They walked on side by side, and by degrees the conversation became more confidential. Walter learnt that his companion's mother kept a school for young, very young, ladies in Seymour-place, near the Edgeware-road, in which she was assisted by her daughter, and that the said daughter, three times a"], [333, "325 THE CARYLLS. week, attended an evening drawing class at the South Kensington Museum, from which she was now returning. After a time, how ever, the young lady lapsed into silence, or contented herself with monosyllabic replies to her companion's questions, a change of manner which he attributed to fatigue. On arriving at the Marble Arch, she assured her escort that she was now perfectly competent to take care of herself, and was resolute in declining his company any further. She could not refuse, however, to shake hands with him, and Walter, who had a very natural curiosity to see her features, contrived during the operation to bring her directly under a lamp. \" Annie ! \" he exclaimed, in the utmost astonishment. \" I beg your pardon, Miss Wood, but, though at times I thought your voice familiar to me, I had no idea it was you. What is the meaning of what you have just told me of your mother's keeping a school ? Where is Mr. Wood?\" And then she told him their story, which Q VOL. I."], [334, "326 THE CARYLLS. was simple enough. Soon after Walter Caryll left them Mr. Wood died suddenly, his death having been probably accelerated by the failure of a bank in which all his savings had been invested, and, in consequence, his widow and daughter found themselves totally unprovided for ; by the assistance of friends they had been established in their present occupation, which at all events gave them bread to eat, and Miss Annie employed all her leisure hours in en deavouring to qualify herself for a higher situation. Walter was warm in his expressions of sorrow for Mr. Wood's death, and the reduced circumstances in which he had left his family. He recollected the invariable kindness which he had experienced during his residence be neath the vicar's roof; and the sudden death of one, who, when last seen, was in the ap parent enjoyment of health and strength, has always something appalling about it, especially to the young. But the predominant feeling was one of satisfaction at the chance which had enabled him to renew his acquaintance with his old friend. During the year and a"], [335, "327 THE CARYLLS. half which he had passed at her father's he had naturally lived on terms of the most familiar intimacy with her. They had walked together, they had danced, fished, and even attempted duets together, and, had he met with any special encouragement, he would, no doubt, have tumbled over head and ears in love with her, for she had not only more than a common share of beauty, but her manner, which, perhaps, had the slightest possible tinge of natural coquetry in it, was particu larly winning. As it was, his feelings never passed the bounds of admiration and regard, for her smiles were distributed with the most praiseworthy impartiality to himself and two other young men, partners of his studies. Moreover, as has already been hinted, a rumour was prevalent that some sort of engagement, or, at least, of attachment, existed between her and John Leycester, who had been a pupil of her father's, but had left him soon after Walter's arrival at Lynburn. Be that as it might, Annie Wood seemed to be perfectly aware of the difficulties of her posi tion, and determined to avoid, as much as"], [336, "328 THE CARYLLS. possible, giving country-gossip an opportu nity of making her an object of its insinua tions. And it was fortunate for her that she had sufficient firmness and decision to act up to the resolutions she had formed; for her father's time was fully occupied with his clerical and scholastic duties; and her mother, who was rather a frivolous woman and fond of junketing herself, was no efficient guide for a young girl exposed to more than ordi nary temptations. But to return from this digession \u2014 \" How singular,\" said Walter, \" that we should meet again in this way, and not recog nize each other till we were on the point of parting !\" Annie was silent. \" For you did not know me, did you ?\" he continued. \" Not at first, but before we reached Oxford Street.\" \" What, would you have allowed me to leave you without a word, without my know ing who had beenjny companion !'' \"Circumstances are so altered \u2014 \" she began."], [337, "329 THE CARYLLS. \"Oh, Miss Wood,\" he exclaimed, \"how little you know me, if you suppose that any change of circumstances could ever make me forget the happy days I passed at Lynburn ; your father's attention ; your mother's kind ness. What a bad opinion you have of me ! How ungrateful you must think me !\" \" No, no ; indeed, Mr. Caryll, you must not think that. It was rather a feeling of false pride.\" \" Well, then, as your penance you must allow me to accompany you home, and renew my acquaintance with Mrs. Wood.\" But this Annie would not hear of. It was too late ; with many other reasons, valid and invalid. At length, as a sort of compromise, he received permission to call on them the following day. \" I must prepare my mother for it,\" said Miss Wood ; \" for we have no visitors, and never go out ourselves. I am afraid she will not half like it. Since my poor father's death she shrinks from all society, but I am sure the monotonous life she now leads is very"], [338, "330 THE CARYLLS. bad for her ; it is so different from what she has been used to.\" \" Of course it is,\" Walter replied, \" and though it may seem like vanity, I am sure the sight of me will do her good. I used to flatter myself that I was rather a favourite of hers.\" \" Yes, you were. But it will seem so odd our having met in this way. She did not wish me to go alone this evening.\" \" I see nothing odd in it; I call it provi dential. Just tell her the truth; say that, before you recognized me, you had told me that your mother kept a school in Seymour Place, and that, when I found out who you were, I vowed that I would knock at every door in the street till I discovered your house. The only difference is, that now I shall present myself as an old friend ; in the other case, it would have been as sl young lady seeking instruction. A . \u2022 < \\ end^^s^^; 1. T. C.
