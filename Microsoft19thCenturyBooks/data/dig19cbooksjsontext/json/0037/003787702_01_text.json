TRUTH IN HELL. Truth is the occult essence of all things \u2014 The pre-existent strength that underlies All sentient form. The clairvoyant descries The secret flowing of its silent springs. The little half-facts that men's knowledge brings Are but the bubbles that, unconquered, rise From out Truth's depths (poor, evanescent prize To lose themselves in mundane comminglings ! But e'en the devils rolling in dark hell Are ruled by Truth ! Each devil true must be Unto the others ; else their policy Were futile, and their plottings idly fell ! If Beelzebub with Satan disagree, Then Pandemonium cannot safely be !"], [16, "4 THE SOLITUDE OF GOD. ' Great God, I pine for sympathy,' said one Who found throughout the dreary world no heart That throbbed in joy-dispensing counterpart With his \u2014 alone since thought-life had begun. ' You seek for sympathy, son of man's son !' Replied Great God ; ' and in the mundane mart You'll find that sympathy ere you depart For Eden \u2014 if untired you seek its sun. ' Man can find sympathy ; but He who made The world cannot ; for, sympathy that could Appease the craving of the God-One should Be offered by a god of equal might \u2014 A being reciprocally infinite ; Eternal only can eternal aid !'"], [17, "5 i BEING\u2014 PRAYER. My lips, O God, do never move in prayer ; My faltering tongue is dumb to give Thee praise ; But if in prayer my voice I ne'er upraise, 'Tis not that I forget that Thou art There. Forgetting thus would lead me to despair ; But not by lip, nor tongue, nor voice I pray ; While on I struggle through each fleeting day Beneath the burden of each carking care. Ah no, but every fibre of my being In mute orisons trembles forth Thy name, Whose sound doth stir anew my spirit's flame, Which Thou dost see, Thou Mighty and All seeing 'Tis not, O Lord, because no prayer I speak That Thou wilt scorn me when Thy face I seek."], [18, "6 \u25a0j TIME. Time is a strange, a wild, elusive thing : Betimes 'tis all too slow, betimes too fast ; 'Tis Now, 'twill be the Future, 'twas the Past A nameless space on the eternal ring. The waiting lover thinks Time's paces slow ; The soul in joy would hold it to the last, Nor let the present e'er be overcast ; The opium-dreamer thinks 'twill never flow ! If in a moment we could conscious be \u2014 By some development of human mind \u2014 That limitless ideas did pervade The mystic dwelling where brief thoughts invade. By that one moment circled and confined \u2014 Then would a moment be eternity !"], [19, "7 WHAT ARE TEARS? Say, what are tears ? Come, tell me what they mean : Go, ask the Alchemist, and he, most bland, Will tell of certain salty moistures seen Secreted by the eye's lachrymal gland. Good Alchemist, in truth you're right, I ween, So far as chemistry can understand The mystic workings of the Will unseen ; But nobler answer must my soul demand. Say, what are tears ? The answer floats from God \u2014 When human hearts are warped and seared by pain, Then tears are heaven's gift to break the strain That else must break the hearts by sorrow trod. Ah, weary me ! I have not wept for years, But oft I sigh for God's true grace of tears."], [20, "8 THE MYSTERY. [Composed August 26, 1894, on the Silver Strand, beyond the ' Fairy Arches,' BundoranT] You, little sand-flower, with four petals blue, A-growing on Bundoran's silvern beach, I pluck, and seek to read your wordless speech \u2014 The speech that's hidden in this ocean, too. I scan your leaves and yellow stamens. Few Look on you as I look ; and you do preach To me ; but, ah ! your silence does not teach The mystery that this sea and you keep true. If I the quintessential sust'nance knew Of this perturbed and snowy-crested sea \u2014 That sustenance the sea doth share with you \u2014 I would know all that makes perplexity ; I would know all God's secrets, and then He Would not be God, for God is mystery !"], [21, "9 . LOVE CAN GUESS. The eye of Heaven, alas ! 1 must confess, Is finer far than thy soft beaming eyes ; And it is true \u2014 no fact will I disguise \u2014 I hear a sweeter voice than you possess A-trembling through the leaves in love's distress. 'Twere vain to hide that when Zephyrus sighs A thousand rarer flower-born perfumes rise, Than you could breathe forth in your guilelessness But through the hollowness of fleshly charms Your soul gleams forth my dreary life to bless ; And love's not sure, but love may safely guess, That when you've done with all this world's alarms. When avid worms have battened on thine arms, Your soul shall live in Nature's loveliness."], [22, "10 i LURID EVERLASTINGNESS : A VISION OF REMORSE. Lulled by a dream-begetting draught I slept ; Methought my spirit's white incarnadined By crime \u2014 erubescent as lip of fiend ; And all that I beheld was red, and wept Red oozing tears. A million reeking fingers kept A-pointing to my reddened soul ; and eyes \u2014 Red reeking eyes, astray through reddened skies Looked through my soul, for \u00e6ons now unslept ! All Time was lost ; I felt Eternity, And through its chasmed voids, all measureless, Red-dropping tongues, to scourge this soul of me, Wagged with a might their fury could not spend ' On sin,' they cried me, ' these your pains depend Thus live you lurid everlastingness.'"], [23, "11 MY FLOWER'S THE HEMP. Faust. ' Deem this language of the flower the answer of an oracle ?' \u2014 Goethe. Methought I held a daisy in my hand, Love's oracle \u2014 the simple moon-daisy ; ' She loves thee,' said it till this soul of me \u2014 This slumbrous soul \u2014 to hopeful glow was fanned. But still I tried ; and still could understand The dream-creating of the flower's decree ! Alas ! it came \u2014 ' She loves thee not !' O, fickle she, And fickle bloom by tear-dimmed eyes so scanned. I turned my head aweary from the flower ; And when I looked again, O, plagued sight ! 'Twas hemp I held, and not the daisy bright : Sad mystic change, and thrice embittered hour ! To me all nature's uncompassionate \u2014 My flower's the hemp, and all its answer \u2014 ' Fate /'"], [24, "12 roof. FAITH'S HAPPINESS. I str_\\yed, and 'neath a church's portal came ; And while I stood in contemplation there I heard the deep-toned murmur of a prayer Breathed by a thousand voices in God's name. I joined not in that prayer \u2014 I held aloof \u2014 I felt like one who shivers on the brink Of some deep gulf, all-fearful lest he sink ;\u2014 While prayer and incense wreathed towards the Yet I was fascinated where I stood ; I tried in vain to tear myself away ; While, over all the voices' magnitude, I heard a louder voice within me say : \u2014 ' Oh, happy, happy blind believing throng, Whose brain is little, and whose faith is strong !"], [25, "13 A SHATTERED HARP. Once, deep within mine inmost self there lay Hushed, nay unwakened, one great harp of love. Awaiting some sweet player who could move That music prisoned in my body's clay. Night after night, and day beyond each day, As moon or sun held monarchy above, This harp lay, silent as a sleeping dove, Unstirred by any fine emotion's fray. At last a player came ! She brought no skill Beyond the power my music's power to kill : With cruel, destructive effort, bold and sharp, She rent the strings, in one discordant strain ! And now my love is but a shattered harp Whose chords can never, never sound again."], [26, "14 SORROW'S ECSTASY. There is a sweetness mingled with my woe ; And as, in some secluded calm retreat, The poisonous nightshade twines with woodbine sweet, So do my grief and soul together grow. Nay, there is ecstasy in all my grief ; It is all-healing to my wounds to know That spotless purity from pain doth flow ! Soul growing towards the God-soul brings relief. With comfortable grief I would not part, Since joy so sweet doth stay the flow of tears, Allaying many a doubt and many fears, And strengthening anew my wearied heart. Leave me my grief while clay my soul doth case : Take not my sorrow till I see God's face."], [27, "15 LOVE'S SOLICITUDE. I fear the wimpling stream where lilies lie ; I fear all forms in interstellar space ; I fear the rain that beats upon thy face ; The leafy boughs that rock and sway on high ! I fear \u00c6olus' breath \u2014 his softest sigh, When he goes wooing in some sacred place : I fear when unseen Hands do interlace The forke'd fire that flashes down the sky ! Why do I fear the brook with blooms besprent ? Why fear the stars, the rain, the boughs, the wind The gracious suspiration Heaven-sent ? And why the lurid light'ning unconfined ? Because these things \u2014 around, beneath, above \u2014 All threaten Thee, the being whom I love !"], [28, "16 TO ONE WHO SINGS. ' My spirit like a charmed bark doth swim Upon the liquid waves of thy sweet singing, Far away, into the regions dim Of rapture.' All through the day I work on wearily ; But when calm Twilight lowers the lamp of Day Ah, then I know thy voice's alchemy : Then, like a night-closed lily when the ray Of Morning bids it blossom charmingly, My soul, grief-closed, unfolds and floats away Upon th' ethereal wings of Harmony, Where God's fair visions float in vast array. If I could linger on in such sweet bliss, In bowers all decked with aerial anadems, Where every flower a glist'ning light begems, I would henceforth forego lov'd Nature's Kiss. Thy song sweeps o'er my soul a flashing light, And lifts it to Imagination's flight !"], [29, "17 TO NORMAN GALE. Blithe Singer ! while I read thy soothing lines I do forget that at a desk I sit Within a gloomy city's black confines ; I am transported, and these dark scenes flit, Replaced by lanes and meads where Nature shines ; With you I read sweet Nature's scroll, God-writ, While ling'ring long in fairest woodland shrines, By lucent, laughing, restless sunbeams lit ! And in cool shades I hear dead Shakespeare's voice In bird-songs sweet, but inarticulate ; And all-forgetful of my bitter fate, I list to Blake's soul-echoes, and rejoice ! When I am weary, give me songs of thine, Then at my desk I never can repine ! 2"], [30, "18 THE GIFT OF SONG A GIFT OF SORROW, ' Most wretched men Are cradled into poetry by wrong, They learn in suffering what they teach in song. Am I a poet ? So 'twould seem, indeed, If I may measure my most mournful fate By what the records of dead poets state ; For I, for singing (world-accursed deed !), Must at gaunt Sorrow's table sit and feed, And sup, 'till Sorrow's draughts intoxicate My being ! Then I, to rot, am hurled prostrate Upon Earth's dung-heap, like some no.xious weed. While there painstricken on that heap I pine, I hear the fiendish shrieks of those who pass, And, mocking, cry : ' Poor bard, alas ! alas !' They spurn me like some sight-offending swine. And stigmatized by all Earth's passing throng, I learn in sorrow what I breathe in song."], [31, "19 THE CRACK OF DOOM. On Heaven's jewelled battlements I stood ; Mine eyes surveyed a cataclysm whose might, Atlantean, should end all things finite \u2014 One universe-annihilating flood ! Then, looking towards the sun-god's neighbourhood, I saw the sun yield up its golden light, And, crumbling, fall into the realms of Night ; The stars were quenched by Doom's breath quick and rude. All objects that mine eyes could dimly scan (Each in its haste the others tried to pass) Consumed and died in thin illusive gas ; All mankind sank to dreamy Devechan, But I \u2014 I stood upon the topmost reach Of Heaven, and laughed into the swamp-world breach."], [32, "20 IMPEDITIVE VIRILITY. Hence ! soul-impeding, sex-bestowing flesh, And let mine inward quintessential I Rejoice in glories that are held on High For souls that burst mortality's curs'd mesh. Or stay ! but tell me why are you so nesh ? Why not a lightless cell, that my soul-eye Might ne'er view flashes of eternity, Whose visions do but make me crave afresh ? Reticulated cell, Virility ! I would that I might cast thee, and so sail Where vast Elysian glories never fail ; Or else relucent God-light never see. Oh ! let me sink in hells of ebon night, Or wrap me round with Heaven's eternal light,"], [33, "21 AN IGDRASIL: THE POET'S SOUL. An Igdrasil the poet's soul should be ! Its sempiternal roots should all be spent Where sable Satan dwells, ignipotent, Amid Hell's fiery waves eternally. Thence should it raise its lucid entity Into the ether-ways of space, unpent, And growing through the wandering world God- sent, Outstretch its arms around stars drifting free. Then, crowning triumph of the poet's soul \u2014 It should grow through the Eden paths above, Where angel-souls weave everness of Love \u2014 The end-all of man's living, and his goal ! An Igdrasil the poet's soul should be ; Then might he sound from Hell to Ecstasy !"], [34, "22 BEFORE THE PORTRAIT OF ONE DEAD : blanche mingins. Most loving face, and face most lovable ! O wondrous eyes, where, shadowed, play and rise The cymophanous founts of Paradise ; Yet face and eyes that lachrymation spell ! To see you were to love, to love you were to dwell In radiance-weeping shadows ; for there lies Within your mystic dream-face that which cries With soundless voice (an intuition's knell) : \u2014 ' The past has wrought me nothing worth its pain ;. To-day I blankly live ; to-morrow, I Beneath the grave-sod, daisy-strewn, must lie ! How do I know that death will yield me gain ?' Ah, beautiful, but most deject ! I ween To-day you sun you in the God-fount's sheen."], [35, "23 I LOVE : a miraculous harp. As Amphion's mystic harp, in days of old, With wavy Music's mystical delight, Charmed forth, from God-lost Inanition's night, The walls of Thebes, e'en so with might untold \u2014 Beyond all thought in sensuous enfold \u2014 Love hath full power, within its God-given right, To tremble music-mansions, Iris-bright, From earth to heav'n \u2014 more dazzling than sun's gold We hearken to the Love-harp's winning tone, And then we see from Chaos start and rise A golden city stretching to the skies, Wherein we overhear Heaven's antiphon ; Love's gift a man may make of Caliban ; A god may make of mid-conditioned man."], [36, "24 PRAYING FOR TEARS. I walk the world in thought-engendered grief : I grieve for all the pain that taints the years ; I grieve for wrongs that rend the soul of seers Who find no power to bring the world relief. I grieve for kings whose golden-sorrowed leaf Of life's brief book is filled with kingly fears ; I grieve for beggars starving through their years, Whose consolation dwells in sweet Belief. If I could weep for all the wrongs I see I would be blest with some relief from woe, But my dim eyes will never yield the flow My wearied heart one moment to set free. And as I wander down the path of years, I pray to God for His good gift of tears."], [37, "MISCELLANEOUS POEMS."], [38, ""], [39, "27 TO THE ROBIN. Sweet robin redbreast, while I hand thee bread I marvel why thy silky breast is red ; And then I ask myself if true it be, The story that I heard of Christ and thee For it is said that while to Calvary The Saviour bore the crucifixion tree, A robin paused upon His sacred head And picked a thorn from out His crown, stained red, When, lo ! the blood that oozed forth, blood most blest. Dropped down and stained the robin's stainless breast ; And ever since that fateful hallowed day Thy breast, sweet bird, is red, the legends say ! Thrice blessed bird, thrice welcome to my bread, Since on thy breast is blood from Jesus' head."], [40, "28 THE SOUL OF JUDAS. A DREAM OF PUNISHMENT. When Judas died, his sin-empurpled soul Sped \u2014 quickly as a God-thought speeds to earth \u2014 On high into the ether 'tween the stars, And fluttered towards the transcendental gates That, in their blinding brilliancy, enfold From view of all things unbeatified The sempiternal glories of high Heaven ! The soul of Judas, guilty with Christ's blood, Sought entrance through those sun-bright gates of Heaven ; But from the dazzling brightness flashed a soul \u2014 An angel-soul of wondrous loveliness \u2014 And hurled the God- man's murderer back from Heaven To wander \u2014 like an outcast from the realms Of God and man \u2014 throughout the dim abyss Of interstellar space. Then fled it down The trackless ether, where no waves of light E'er cross the Stygian gloom, unsearchable."], [41, "A Thc Soul of Judas. But there no rest the soul of Judas found. Then hied it, in a hopeless agony, Unto the fcetid entrance-gates of hell, And craved admittance there. But lo ! at once A phalanx of discordant sounds arose From out the seething sulphur of dark hell : A million million damned souls cried out \u2014 ' Avaunt ! thou murderer of the Son of God !' And then a million million devils came All hissing\u2014' Hence, you scarlet-tainted shape ! By crucifying Jesus you withheld From us some myriad souls that else were ours ! Begone ! not e'en such rest as hell affords Shall ever now be yours !' And speaking thus, The devils drove the soul of Judas far, In dim remoteness, from their black abyss. Writhing in agony, beyond all pains Of earth or hell, the wandering soul pursued Its unrewarded, nay, accursed search For some soul-habitation where to dwell. It fled from star to star, from sphere to sphere ; But everywhere it was denied a home, Till, weary of its interstellar flight, It fell pain-fluttering to the earth again. It wandered, like some ghost, into a wood, Amid whose sombrous boughs the trancing notes"], [42, "The Sold of Judas. 30 l> Of one lone nightingale made musical The erstwhile pulseless peace that reigned there. ' Ah ! let me dwell enfeathered in your form !' The soul of Judas craved in language known But inarticulate. And straight the bird, Affrighted, ceased to sing, and winged its flight To some unknown retreat. The wandering soul Then sought a snail that crawled along the ground : ' You meanest thing that grovels on this earth, Will you afford a dwelling for this soul That vainly seeks for any kind of home ?' The lowly snail shrank far within its shell In mute denial of the outcast's quest ! And now, from out the darkness of the wood The astral form appeared of Him who died In torture on the Cross of Calvary ! The soul of Judas shuddered at the sight. ' I pray Thee, God, in Mercy's sacred name, Send me to blackest hell, or to some place More horrible than hell. But do not come With those sad eyes of Thine, with bleeding hands And side and feet, and with that crown-pierced head. To torture me. All other agony I'll bear unmurmuring, but save me this f So pleaded Judas in the forest depths ; But since that moment, now long decades gone,"], [43, "The Soul of Judas. 31 The soul of Judas wanders peacelessly Throughout the baseless realms of boundless space, All vainly seeking to evade the Christ Whose blood-stained astral haunts him evermore ! From star to star, from sphere to sphere it hies, But everywhere it sees the haunting form Of Jesus crucified. It vainly asks For mercy. When its piteous wail is heard, The spheres yield back one answer, \u2014 only one \u2014 ' This is the punishment of that red soul That crucified the Son of the APost High P"], [44, "32 THE DYING BEGGAR TO HIS GOD ' Good God, I die !' a beggar cried, A-lying all a-cold ; And with his weak, departing breath To God his grief he told : \u2014 ' In poverty I was brought forth ; And, poor, I worked to live ; But age, alas ! can bear no toil For fruits that labours give ! ' And so for years I begged and begged For life-sustaining bread : Forgive me, God ! that I have failed To keep life nourished !' Ah ! ere that beggar's soul passed forth, His face grew bright ! He said \u2014 ' No crime, thank God, in poverty : 'Tis good to die for bread !'"], [45, "33 OF A CHILD. A RONDEL. Such joy it was to sit me down And listen to her baby-talk, Or take her when I went to walk With Innocence mine hours to crown I recked not how the world might frown, Or whither Fate's dark form might stalk Such joy it was to sit me down And listen to her baby-talk ! These moments all my griefs did drown ; Alas ! that some avenging hawk Should swoop and all my purpose balk ! Such joy it was to sit me down And listen to her baby-talk ! 3"], [46, "34 THE LILY. Night brooded over lone Gethsemane ; And 'neath the shade of one tall sobbing tree The Son of God knelt down and wept and prayed ; He writhed and groaned beneath the burden laid Upon His spirit by the sins of men, Until His soul was overwrought, and then Great beads of blood burst from His sacred brow. He cried : ' My Father, if it may be now, Oh, take away this bitter load from Me ! But if, by Thy wise will, this may not be \u2014 If this dread chalice may not pass away \u2014 Great God, Thy will be done, I humbly pray !' Then Jesus staggered weakly to His feet, And doing so He heard the woods repeat The words that He had sent on high to God When His rent form lay stretched upon the sod. But lo ! while yet His heart was torn with sighs, A touching vision swam before His eyes :"], [47, "The Lily. 35 He saw, through all the terrors of His grief, That every blade of grass and every leaf Bent down and wept great glistening, pearly tears, While God's hot wrath was ringing through the spheres ! Then every flower, save one, bowed down its head \u2014 The snow-white Lily stayed erect, and said : ' Great God, Thou know'st that I am white and pure ; Why, then, should I humility endure ?' Then calmly to the stately flower Christ turned, \u2014 While in His heart the fire of love fast burned, \u2014 .\\nd in unangered tones He softly said, With lips now stained unnaturally red : ' The purest thing that in the ivorld could be Alight well be sad and weep at sight of A fe?

Soft snow is on the ground, And 'neath the snow the cherished buds sleep sound ; But when the snow-wreaths go \u2014 When summer fountains play and flow, Iris-hued beneath the sun, \u2014 Sleeping buds, their sleep now done, Rejoice in life new-found, And peep triumphant o'er the ground.

The Dublin Figaro says : ' That a real poet has arisen for Ireland in the person of Mr. Louis H. Victory, this little book of his \"Collected Verses\" gives the most ample and convincing proof. . . . We can say that we have never, even in the works of our greatest poets, come upon so many pretty fancies and high and noble sentiments as are expressed in clear and meaningful words in this slender volume. ...\" Ophelia,\" although it marks the most ambitious flight our author has taken, and is grandly worded, is, we fancy, too vague in meaning to be fully appreciated by the majority of people.' The Weekly Irish Times says : ' His pen seems to be untiring in the production of poetry of a nature likely to render his name a household word in many homes in Ireland. Such subjects as the mystery of evil, the essential beauty and sublimity of Nature, the evanescence of human life, and the happy immortality of the soul \u2014 these, and like high themes, occupy the pen of Mr. Victory.' The Kilkenny Moderator says : ' These verses proclaim a real poet.' The Cork Examiner says : ' This is quite a dainty collection of poems, evincing feeling and imagination, as well as the technical ability to give them melodious expression. We cannot deny the author of these verses thoughtfulness, keen sympathy, and consider able deftness in expression.' The IVelcotne Hour says : ' The pieces are marked by much grace and sweetness ; and a pure and lofty tone of thought veins not a few of these lyrical effusions.'"], [84, "2 The Freeman's Journal says : ' Mr. Victory's verses are full of true and tender sympathy with human nature and the external world, expressed in choice language.' The Belfast Morning News says : ' We cannot but say that this little volume of \"Collected Verses\" is rich in a strange melody, and contains many beautiful thoughts, expressed in beautiful and musical verse.' Poetry and Prose says : ' A portrait and sketch of Mr. Louis H. Victory appear in this number, and it is therefore opportune that we should be able to notice his \" Collected Verses.\" Several of the poems are remarkable for the depth of thought contained in them, and not a few for the sweetness and purity of the diction. . . . He remarks the varied wonders of Nature, and sings of them.' The Muses says : ' Mr. Victory's poems are delicately beautiful, and finished in style. They are also full of moral truths.' Extract from Biographical .Sketch in ' Modern Irish Poets ': ' This work contains many choice flowers of thought.' The Cornish Post says : ' Many pretty conceits are to be found in this little book. . . . Here is a bit that suits human life and Nature \u2014 \" The Swallow and the Bee.\" ' Ihe Catholic Times says : ' Mr. Louis H. Victory's book is a charming one, and to lovers of the Muse it will need no recom mendation. Over forty poems appear in the present work, and all of them possess an originality and depth of character rarely to be met with. A good deal of what is printed and designated as poetry nowadays makes one inclined to think that the age of true poetry has passed away, and this is perhaps one of the many reasons why poetical works are avoided by the masses. Mr. Victory's collection of poems ought to awaken enthusiasm in the art. It would be rather difficult to enumerate the choice pieces in the book ; one and all are excellent, and a pleasant hour may be spent in perusing \" Collected Verses.\" ' ELLIOT STOCK, PATERNOSTER ROW, LONDON."], [85, ""], [86, ""], [87, ""], [88, ""]]
