I have snatched the hours which were necessary to compose the following Recollections from the cares and anxieties of business. I have somewhere read that when the mind is over-burdened with one set of thoughts which by constant recurrence become oppressive, the best and most certain cure is to force it to occupy itself with another class of ideas. With this intention I began the following papers. I found the plan eminently successful. My mind was relieved, and sometimes exhilarated, 'by the thoughts and fancies it had raised. To the public I submit the following sketches, in the hope they will see in the circumstances an excuse for whatever rugged ness and want of finish there may be. I cannot do this with indifference, but I confidently believe they will censure with judgment where censure is deserved, and forgive where there has been too much presumption. The scenes have been laid in Birmingham, but the characters have been culled in many parts of the kingdom. It appeared to me when I began my task, that the locality must be somewhere either in Fancidale, Imagehill, Bonville, or in some other part of Airshire, or in a real land. Birmingham, I thought, would appear to give an air of fact to the fictions, therefore was it"], [8, "IV PBEFACE. chosen. There was another reason ; part of these Recollections appeared in a local paper \u2014 to the Editor of which I here express my hearty acknowledgments. I have striven throughout the work to expose abuses, which I hope I shall see corrected, either by their own excesses, or by the strong hand of power. Whatever profit such abuses may yield to one side, there is a large crop of wrong and misery, and too often ruin, on the other. I have also endeavoured to inculcate such lessons as I believe the world will be none the worse for practising. I now submit the work to the approbation or censure of the public. If I were to say I am indifferent to the one, I should not express the genuine sentiments of my mind, and I hope I shall be corrected rather than offended by the other. At any rate, I adopt the language of Old Joe, \" Trust in the Lord, Master John, trust in the Lord ; if your deeds be right, He will not see you always in trouble.\" Birmingham, 1864,"], [9, "of a fabcsmau. CHAPTER I. MY FIRST ORDER. My first journey to London. Aye, that was a journey, one that I never shall forget, until my nose and my toes are turned to the turf, and a stone at the head of a little mound of earth says, \" Sacred to the memory of .\" No matter who; I am an unknown nobody, and perhaps there will be no stone to give such immortality as stones can give to one who, I am ashamed to say, has not done much good in the world. Sitting by my father's fire-side, hearing him continually com plaining about the badness of trade, how his customers were for ever docking his prices, and lowering and lowering them continually, until it was as much as ever he could do, by thrift and scheming, to get anything at all for himself. Something he was really obliged to sell at a loss. How others in his trade managed to live was more than he could tell, for they undersold him everywhere. \" Father,\" said I, \" why don't you go to London, and sell your goods there ? \" The suggestion chimed in with my mother's thought, who, though very iond of my father, was always lamenting his want of ambition. \" Because he has no spirit,\" said she. \" I have wanted him to do it many a time but he will not ; he lets everybody pass him in trade \u2014 he will remain a poor drudge all his life ; I wish I had been a man, we should then have lived at the sign of the case is altered.\" I must confess that my father had always been an authority with me. I had thought his judgment superior to any man's judg-"], [10, "2 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. ment, and with me it was always sufficient to close any question in dispute, by saying, \" My father says so, and there is an end of it.\" But I bad begun to suspect his opinion was not unfailing, and from the manner in which my mother spoke, to think that he was a spiritless being, contented to vegetate, and let the world go wag its own way. So I determined to spring in for mylelf. Besides, the attraction for a young man to see London ; a place where the streets were paved with apple dumplings, the houses tiled in with pancakes, and pigs and poultry ready roasted ran about the streets with knives and forks in their backs, and crying out, \" Come and eat me, come and eat me.\" And the King lived there in a great gilded palace, and rode in a golden coach. And the Lord Mayor dressed in fine robes, and rode in a golden coach like the kings. To go to such a fine place was my highest ambition. fc>o I determined to see it. \" Father, let me go,\" said I. \" Let you go,\" said he, \" a boy like you.\" At this speech I began to feel a little indignant, and putting my fingers to my cheeks to pull away at the down which was to be my whiskers when properly grown, I shook my head, and com pressed my lips. I felt the rebel rising within me, and thought, though I don't think I said it, \" You dare uot say that again.\" \" Yes, let him go,\" said my mother. \" Why ? \" said my father, \"he will be robbed before he has been there five minutes.\" \"Then I will go wiih him,\" replied my mother, \" and take care of him.\" I thought I might be trusted myself ; but then you see as my mother was with me no one could jeer me by saying, \" Does your mother know you're out ? \" So it was arranged that mother and I were to go up to London to get orders. I felt so proud. I do believe I was three inches taller. I found that my trousers did not cover my ankles, and that my coat sleeves did not reach my wrists, and that it was not be coming in me to go to London in that over-grown toggery. So I was to have a new suit, it being very important that I should make a good impression upon those respectable firms who were about to become customers of our bouse. I was an altered man. Yes, man ; for though I was but a boy, full grown though, yet my new dignity had elevated me to the full dimensions of a man. I began to think of a wife and family, so set up a sweetheart at once. One of the workpeople called me \" John,\" as he had"], [11, "3 MK FIRST ORDER. been used to do. I checked him, and said, \" I beg your pardon, but when you address me in future you will please to say Mister John.\" So I snuffed him out for his impudence. I felt that I ought to look wise, so I Irowned upon everybody, and never by any chance let a smile creep over my face. My mother and I made up some patterns, and a small stock of brooches, and charms, and earrings, and finger rings, and shirt studs, and bosom pins, for we were jewellers, and started from the Nelson Inn in the Bull King, by the London Tally Ho, the guard playing on the bugle horn, \" See the rosy morn appearing.\" I must confess that, though it was the first time I had ever left Birmingham, I felt no regret. After a long and weary ride, London \u2014 the great London, the renowned London, the London of my youthful imagination \u2014 was reached, the guard playing upon his bugle horn, \" See the conquering hero comes ; \" the coachman leaning to his four \" tits,\" giving them their heads, and flourishing his whip fancifully over his \" bits of blood,\" and making them gallop along as freshly as though they had just begun, rather than just finished the journey. In London we were We had some names given to us, who were said to be large buyers in our way. I must now confess that when we were put to it, my mother and I, we had not the amount of courage we ought to have had, and that we had persuaded ourselves we bad. We agreed not to make any enquiries at the inn at which we stopped ; we said it was better not. But I am afraid this was the way we excused our cowardice. We called our want of pluck, policy. So we went out into the street ; there were such crowds of people moving along in one continual stream, all in a hurry, as if life and death depended upon what they were doing. They knocked us and jostled us about shamefully. At length my mother, a little vexed, cried, \" Dang the folks, where are they coming to ? Ask some of them if they know Ketterman and Stims ? \" I must confess, to my shame, that I said, \" I don't like.\" My mother was afraid too, and let hundreds upon hundreds pass before she asked anyone ; at last she did. \" What part do they live ? \" was the reply. \" They are wholesale jewellers,\" said my molher, rather bewildered by such a question. \" But what part of London do they live in ? \" We looked at our list ; we"], [12, "4 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. had got the names and nothing more. \" Where do you come from ? \" said the man. \" From Birmingham,\" said I ; but not in a proud tone. \" Then do you go back to Birmingham, and get to know where the people live,\" and he went on his way laughing. My mother did not speak, and I did not speak. We walked about in silence \u2014 in dead beat silence. Afraid to go out of sight of the inn, for fear we should lose ourselves ; afraid to ask any more questions, for fear we should let any more people know what a pair of fools we were ; so we walked about. We had not a word to throw at a dog. I carried the goods about until T was downright tired. My mother would say, \" We would go into that shop,\" only we were not to call on the shopkeepers, or we should never be able to sell to any wholesale houses at any time after, for we should be marked. Dinner time came. We went into an eating-house to dine ; there, at the table at which we sat, was a Birmingham man, a silversmith, in London on the same hop. He very kindly gave us the directions we wanted. Instantly our tongues began to wag ; the depres- sion which had so unaccountably come over us gave way to jollity. At the very first place we went to we sold all our stock, and took a large order for more \u2014 so large that we dare not ask for any more, for fear we should not be able to get them up. So we passed the remainder of our time in seeing the sights of London. Success had crowned our journey, and we felt very proud of ourselves. We were quite as good as any Londoner ; so when they jostled we jostled again, and threatened to let them know. We returned to Birmingham in no meek spirit, I can assure you. We had sold all our stock, taken a large order \u2014 a larger one than our house had ever had. We felt rather crowish, and looked down upon my father as a poor spiritless fellow, who would never rise in the world. The goods were got up. I saw to the packing of them myself, made out the invoice myself, went to the coach office myself, and when I returned and put the carriage-book upon tbe desk I felt very big, I can assure you. I looked down upon my father, thought him au old duffer, and assumed the direction of the business, taking all control out of his bands ; for I was not going to let my fortune and my trade be marred by him. My mother rather encouraged me. I had more"], [13, "MY FIRST ORDER. 5 goods made for my next journey. I was very choice in the style and the patterns ; was above taking any advice from my father, whom I had completely put behind me. When the time came I went in flying colours by myself \u2014 I was not going to have my mother with me again \u2014 to London, to receive the money for my first London order. I arose early the following morning, intending to pay the money into a bank, to our credit in Birmingham. When I got there the place was shut up. The men had run away. They were a set of sharpers, and had swindled everybody. My crowing spirit left me. I buried my face in my hands, and cried like a spoilt child. I came home again wiser if not richer, and ever after was willing to admit that the spirit of youth should be restrained by the experience of age."], [14, "6 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER II MY RETURN As soon as I discovered that we had been swindled out of our money I felt almost broken-hearted ; I had not spirit for ar.ything. London, that I had thought so highly of, seemed to me a den of thieves. All the stories which I had heard of the wickedness of that great place shot through my mind, and made me wonder, if there were a good God presiding over the ways and doings of men, why he let his vengeance sleep ? why did he not destroy that sink of iniquity, as formerly, for less cause, he did the cities of the plain ? In my youthful judgment, my calamity required the direct interposition of an angry God. Had the fire and the thunder been at my disposal I should have used them blindly and revengefully. 1 smarted under the sense of wrong, and like, I am afraid, too many of us would do, had I had the power, I should have committed a much greater wrong in revenge for the one I had sustained. I left London with a savage and scowling frown. It had no charms for me. I thought it the resort of the scum of the three kingdoms, and tbe world to boot. A place filled with abomina tions and every iniquity. Could I have given such a description as could have gained and kept the ear of the world, I should, like Peter the Hermit, bave roused all mankind to go on a crusade of mercy and destroy that city until one stone should not have been left upon another ; nay, there should not have been a broken arch upon which the New Zealander could stand while he contemplated the unmeaning ruins. The horses which dragged the coach on which I returned seemed but sorry cattle ; the harness was shabby and worn out. The guard's bugle was out of tune. The coachman's attempt to"], [15, "MY KETURN. 7 show off filled me with disgust. The trees threw up naked branches above the leaves, and seemed dying at the top. Every thing was going to decay. There was a shade even in the very sunshine. All things understood my calamity, and decayed because I suffered wrong. Even Birmingham \u2014 good old Birmingham, the darling of my heart, the place which saw my birth, where I spent my boyhood, where, if it shall please Providence to grant my most fervent wish, I desire these bones of mine to be laid, by the side of those I have loved so well \u2014 even Birmingham, the jewel of my soul, the day star of all my aspirations, the \" god of my idolitary,\" had no charms for me. As I entered it tears came into my eyes, and I wept. But I found there nature's balm, and my deep grief was relieved. My errand had been oue of disappointment. For that night I determined to keep my secret. There should be but one head tossing about on the bed of rest to whom slumber refused to administer relief. When morning came, I knew I should feel like the poor bankrupt when he knows that his ruin is no longer a secret, relieved and comforted, though perhaps he may be happy no more, for my secret would also be known. As soon as I arrived in Birmingham, I engaged one of Pugh's coaches, or rather, as they were somewhat irreverently called, one of \" Pugh's barges,\" to take me and my boxes home. Tbe coachman gave his rat. tat, tat, at the door. Our servant, Mary, came out at once. My mother, having heard the wheels of the coach, was soon at the door too. \" It is Master John,\" said Mary. \" It is my own boy come home again,\" said my mother, \" all safe and sound. Take his boxes into the house.\" \" Put them in the warehouse, Mary,\" said I, very gloomily. *' Give me his benjamin and hat boxes,\" said my mother, and she went panting into the house with my great coat on one arm and a hat box in each hand. I discharged the coachman, and went in home too. As soon as I got there my mother almost smothered me with kisses. \" Motber,\" said I, \" do not do so.\" \" Not kiss my own child,\" said she, \" not kiss my own child ! What has come to you? Because you have been to London, and done that as your father could not do, you have become ashamed of your poor old mother, who suckled you and gave you milk.\" \"And fed me with pap,\" said I, for I was in the"], [16, "8 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. humour for none of this. \" Not kiss my own boy ! what, do you want to break my old heart ? \" \" No, mother,\" said I, some what touched. \" You my kiss me again. I like it.\" \" And were the good dear gentlemen as kind to you as they were to us ? Oh, they were nice gentlemen. How did you do with them ? Have you got plenty of orders? \" \" Mother, we will talk about busi ness in tin morning,\" said I. \" Where's my father? \" \" Gone to bis club,\" said she. \" For my part, 1 cannot tell what men want to be always at their clubs for. I hope it is not an excuse for something else. He is not as he used to be ; there must be some causp for it. He had better not let me find him out ; if he does, I'll club him. If he does not mind, some of these times, I'll watch; and if I do find him out, I'll club him ! \" \" Mother,\" said I, \" what have you got to eat ? I am hungry.\" \"Mary is cooking you a nice chop,\" said she, \"and I have tapped one of those three-year-old barrels df ale on purpose for you \" \" Mother,\" said I, I would rather have coffee.\" \" Coffee ! \" said she, in astonishment. \" What, coffee, after so long a journey ? Coffee has got no strength in it ; you must have something better than coffee.\" \" No, mother, I prefer coffee.\" \" Why, what has come over my child, to want coffee ; but coffee it shall be. Whatever is the matter with him that such alterations have come over him. I suppose it is the way with all boys just as they are becoming men. Men are strange creatures, and bave many little ways with them that we women are obliged to submit to. When I was a young woman I thought man a mystery, and now I am grown old, and know more about him, I think him a mystery still ; he is so fond of a cigar and whiskey punch. Now, Mary, make haste with the chop and coffee ! \" My mother set about preparing the supper table with her own hands. I must confess that I loved my mother. It is true she was a fussy woman ; but nature had blessed her with a kind heart, in which smiles and tears followed each other like an April day. Now sunshine, which fills all with joy, then rain, at which none are discomforted. There was no one sick but she was ready with herb teas, or some all-powerful medicine suitable to the ailment. There was no one in distress but she had for them a word of comfort and a helping hand. WThen I was in health I used to"], [17, "9 MY RETURN. laugh at her eccentricities, but when I was sick I would let none other nurse me. Blessings on her memory. She will live in my remembrance until it shall please God to call me home. \" There,\" said she, \" there is your chop, and there is your coffee. Now set to and eat it. I have been thinking, John, while you have been away, what a blessed thing it is to have a good son like you ; so sensible as you are, too. There is many a poor mother with a child, but half-witted. She is fond of it, though, very fond of it. How much more should I be with mine.\" \" Mother, mother,\" said I, \" don't be foolish.\" \" It is the truth,\" said she, \"and if you call truth foolishness, I am foolish ; but I do not. To think that my boy is able to go to London by himself, and come back again all safe and sound ; can do business like a man, and take his place with men. Has courage enough for anything ; a spirit to improve himself and his condition in the world far above whatever his father had. He is an ambitious boy, and I should not at all wonder but, when he gets older, he will not be satisfied with nasty smoky Birmingham, but like a gentleman, as he will be, will go to live at Edgbaston, and be respectable. I am sure there is no lady who lives there but will be but too glad to fall in love with him and marry him. I shall be so happy to be at the wedding, and at the christening. I will be godmother to my own grandchild. Bless its little heart. Ah, you need not hold up your hand ; I know what I am talking about. I have been thinking of it for a long whUe, and I will tell it now. I should not be at all surprised, whoever lives to see it, but my boy will be Lord Mayor of Birmingham. There will be an honour for you. Then our family will be understood, and take its proper place in the town. Oh, how happy I am in having such a son ! If I did not know, for the very best of all reasons, that your father as is your father, was your father, I could not believe him to be your father. You are nothing like him, nothing. You are more of me.\""], [18, "10 RECOLLF.CTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER III. FORGIVEN It was a weary, weary night ! Trouble made the heart sick. I tossed about my bed to seek a position in wbich I could rest, but all in vain. The few short snatches of sleep tbe night gave were passed in troubled dreams. I dreamed that 1 bad fallen into a pit ; as I sought to get out, every place upon which I put my foot gave way. When I so far succeeded as to put my hand upon the top, the support to which I clung became treacherous, and down I fell deep, deeper and deeper ; until the sun, which seemed as by miracle to stand over that pit, appeared no larger than a star, so far did I fall. I dreamed that I had left the land of men, and fallen into one which was in habited by animals of a totally different form and disposition. As I fell among them they gave a loud cry\u2014 a. horrible ex pression of pleasure \u2014 and rushed upon me as do hounds upon the weeping stag when they have brought him to bay. They tried to tear me to pieces. I contended with them for life \u2014 for dear life. I cried for help, but no help came. Death was upon me in great and revolting horrors. I made one strong, last, and determined effort to escape. As I did so, I awoke from that scene of horrors. I found myself all wet with a copious per spiration, and blessed my God that it was only a dream. If poor wretches, whom all the world blames, upon whom fortune frowns, who wander houseless and friendless, feel half the misery I felt, their punishment is great indeed ! Be merciful, O man ! Censure not with too severe a judgment, until you have suffered as poor wretches suffer. It is well to have a home filled with all the comforts and all the luxuries this world can give; it is well never to have known, except in fiction, the"], [19, "FORGIVEN. 11 miseries which want and poverty bring ; it is well to be so wealthy that you have never been friendless ; it is well to be one of the great ones of the earth ; but, oh I it is better to have a feeling heart ; to be imbued with that mercy which makes man akin to the angels of God ! As soon as we commenced business in the morning I told my story. I thought I saw a slight smile of satisfaction creep over my father's face. His time of triumph had arrived. \" And so,\" he said, \" you have made a fine thing of it, your mother and you. You are like a great many more; you can stand and blame and find fault ; but when you are called upon to act and do, you fail as often as any one else. Your father is a poor spiritless old duffer, is he ? \u2014 a king whose throne ought to be declared vacant ? New blood should be infused, and a younger king should reign ! A very fine thing indeed the young king has made of it. Young men now-a-days have a notion that, if any good is to be done in the world, it is they who are to do it. Yes, I dare say they are of that opinion ; but who else is ? I should like to know. It will be a long time before the world is much improved by billycock hats and hairy chins. If beards could brush away the cobwebs of time, it would not be long before all things were whitewashed. Poor weak things as they are, they think that if they wear a beard, look fierce, hold up their heads, and take a proud and stately step, they are grandly wise and outrageously useful. Conceit, self-conceit, is the only quality young men have now-a-days. They can do nothing but please themselves and the silly girls. When I was a young man, business was the order of the day ; and there will be no good done until it is so again, and every one minds his own business, and does not trouble himself about other people's. So you have lost all your money and the goods to boot, have you, and the expenses of the two journeys to London into the bargain ? Now, just tell me, you and your mother, will you, how it is to be made up. What answer am I to give to my creditors when they ask for their money ? I cannot pay them. Do you think they will be satis- fied when I tell them that you and your mother went to London with a large stock of goods, that you let some swindlers have them who did you out of the money, and therefore I cannot pay ? Do you think that will satisfy them ? Come, tell me.\""], [20, "12 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. My mother, you see, knew my father's ways a great deal better than I did, so I let ber speak. She could see by the result who was to blame. So she thought tbe best way to meet the storm was to coax a bit. \" Well,\" said she, \" if anybody had told me those gentlemanly people were swindlers, I should not bave believed them. They spoke so kindly. They aspirated their h's so well. They wore gold chains on their waistcoats, and gold rings on their fingers ; their linen was well got up \u2014 it was as white as a curd, and as stiff as a board. Their whiskers and hair were well brushed, well curled, and as glossy as polished jet. Their rings had got diamonds in them, and they flashed like a sunbeam. Well, thought I, if these are not gentlemen, I should like to know what gentlemen are. If a saint from heaven had been called upon to give his opinion of them, he would have said they were gentlemen.\" \" Then,\" said my father, \" the saint would have been a fool for coming so long a journey to give such an opinion. Anybody with half an eye would have seen what they were. I get my living by jewellery, and it is my interest to bring it into fashion ; but I never saw a fellow all bedizened with jewellery, but he was either a fool or a knave. A fool if he thought that made him somebody, and a knave if he did it with the intention of making people believe he was somebody. There was our neighbour Piper, a shallow-pated fellow as ever lived. They made him an overseer, and what did he do? Why, he bought himself a diamond ring, a gold chain, and watch, the same day. He had the front of his warehouse altered ; a window knocked in here, another built up there, and all cemented and painted afresh. He had ' Philip Piper, ginger bread baker to the King,' in great staring letters, painted all along the front. It took him all the first week to read in the papers : ' At a meeting of magistrates, held on Monday, Philip Piper, Esq., was appointed overseer.' I wonder he did not have it framed and glazed. It took him all the first month to look at himself in the glass, and see what a gentleman office and jewellery made him. He dates all the after events of his life from that time. ' When I was overseer,' he says, or ' a year after I was overseer.' He was so proud of the honour, it made him strut and straddle, suck his teeth with a smack, and hum tunes to himself all day long. He was the biggest fool that ever was"], [21, "13 FORGIVEN. invented. You know it. and bave laughed at him many a time. Yet, because men bedizen themselves with jewellery you think that a sufficient reason to trust them \" '' That is all very true,\" said my mother, \u2022' but how are we to judge? We go to London to look for orders. The gentlemen look to us all right. All the appearances are in their favour. We could only tell from what we saw, and from what we did sec, they were all we could expect. Never mind, that is all gone. There is no use crying over shed milk ; it is lost, and we bad better try to get some more. 1 am sure Johu and I did the best we could, and what could we do more ? \" My father turned to me and said, \" Did vou tell any one that you had made a bad debt?\" \" I did, father; 1 told Mr. Mincher, from whom we have our gold \" \" And what did he say ? \" \" He asked me how much we had lost, and 1 told him. I thought, perhaps, you might want to ask him for an extension of credit, aud so I told him.\" \" And how did he seem to like it?\" said my father. \" He did not seem to like it at all. He kept biting bis nails, and spitting, and jerking his head ; he frowned upon me, he fidgeted upon his seat, he buttoned his coat, then unbuttoned it, then blew his nose, then did not seem to know what he was doing.\" \" That man will give me trouble,\" said father ; \" there is no greater coward than a money coward . he takes fright at the very slightest appearance of loss. Like a coward who fills his house with revolvers, swords, and pikes, and hangs bells everywhere \u2014 making his house into a fortress \u2014 all the time crying out, ' What are the police doing that they do not afford us the protection we pay them for ? ' when perhaps they have never been visited by a thief during the whole course of their lives. So the money coward is so frightened that he loses all discretion, and frequemly by his own fears and want of forbearance brings on the loss, about which he has been so much afraid. That Mincher will be coming blustering here, and wanting me to pay him what I owe him ; and if I do not, as I cannot, by way of helping me to do what this loss has made impossible, he will set the law upon me, and perhaps ruin me.\" \" No, no,\" said mother, \" I am sure Mr. Mincher has always been a nice gentleman ; he has always asked in the kindest manner how I have been ; he always shakes hands with me when he"], [22, "14 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. comes here, and he always smiles in tbe roost agreeable manner. I am sure he will not press us because of our loss. Besides, in former years, you have many a time assisted him, I know ; and have let him have his money before it was due without taking any discount. Don't be afraid ; he will not injure you. It is a great many years now since these things happened, but I remember, as if it were but yesterday, with what strong and deliberate emphasis my father said, \" You mark my words, and remember them well. When sorrow comes into our house she will be introduced by him. He is too oily, 'there is a selfish- ness at the bottom of that man's character which his sleekness, his humility, and his unbounded civility is only intended to hide. I believe he would ruin his dearest friend to save himself a shilling; and treat with the greatest harshness those who have in former years laid him under a debt of gratitude.\" The severity with which my father said this frightened my mother, and she began to cry. She said, \" I am sure, when John and 1 went to London we did it for the best. We thought we should help vou in your business ; we had no other motive than that. We did not intend to bring you into trouble.\" My father took us both by the hand. He looked kindly upon us, and said with a tear starting in his eye, for he had a feeling heart, \" I believe it, and I must say that no man has had a better wife, or a better son, than I now hold by the hand. With them true, I can bear the worst.\" My mother let her head fall upon my father's left shoulder ; she then put her hand to his right cheek, and said, \" I knew he would not always chide.\" My father turned his head to look at my mother \u2014 their lips gently met ; there was nothing which you could call a kiss, but yet the eyes of both were lighted up with love. I remember well that I thought, if, when 1 appeared before the Great Judge at the last day, I met with a father as good as mine, my sins would be blotted out."], [23, "15 BEGINNING OF TROUBLE.

He had a very heavy payment to make up, and would be obliged to my father if he would pay him the amount owing, as he found things very difficult, and money hard to be got. He was sure he did not know where the money was gone to; it was as if it had all left the country. It was strange how those foreigners were enabled to fetch the gold from us, just as they wanted. How it was the Government allowed them he could not tell ; but he supposed they were all leagued together in a sort of Holy Alliance, and did what they liked, setting up an excuse to please the people. It did not matter if the country was ruined, those foreigners must have the money they wanted, all as one. It would be a good thing for us if there were no foreigners. 1 hey made a point of coming for our money when trade was bad, and they were not satisfied unless they had it in millions ; they did it for the very purpose of embarrassing us. They hope thus to bring about our ruin ; but as soon as they see it does not ruin us they bring it all back again ; they know it is safer here than in their own scurvy countries. My father told him he was sorry he could not pay him then, and he was afraid he should be obliged to ask him for some indulgence when the time of credit had expired. He then said, \"I believe my son told you be had made a bad debt in London ; that loss will embarrass me for a short time, and I am sorry I shall be obliged to claim your indulgence until I have recovered myself.\" Mr. Mincher pinched his thin lips together with a peculiar nervous twitching ; his fingers were moved quickly, and by jerks, like as the spider moves his legs when"], [24, "16 RECOLLECTION'S OF A TRADESMAN. pulling at his web to feel if his prey be fairly caught. He looked at my father firmly, and paused a little before he replied, as if he were collecting himself for the encounter. Before he spoke he seemed to swallow something which had risen in his throat. He then said, with his head slightly on one side, and looking upon the ground, \" I must have my money. Let there be no mistake ; I say again, I must have my money. I see how it is with you \u2014 first come, first served ; and I am determined not to be last.\" \"But, Mr. Mincher,\" said my father, \"you and I have traded together for many years ; you have never lost a penny by me, and I hope you never will ; on tbe contrary, I have frequently paid you money when you have said money was of service to you. If you give me indulgence I shall pay you interest for it. With a little forbearance I shall soon recover. If one trades man cannot ask another tradesman, with whom he has dealt for years, for a little time, from whom is he to expect mercy ? Besides, you are here before the time of credit has expired.\" \" No matter,\" was tbe replv, \" 1 have already said I must have my money, and you must find it before the day is out, or expect to be arrested to-morrow.\" When I heard this a feeling which I had never experienced before arose within me. I did my best to control it, for I had already done mischief by interfering in my father's affairs. I felt as if I should like to fight ; as if I should like to crush the hard-hearted and selfish fellow. At the moment I did not care what might after befall me if I could but punish him as he deserved; I have been told that such a feeling was but the promptings of the devil ; but surely if there is a Being who bas implanted in our hearts, for wise purposes, a just sense of right and wrong, it is his promptings which make us execrate cruelty and revolt at injustice. He will not look with censure, when by one of his own laws we are filled with indignation. Mr. Mincher left the warehouse, and it might or might not have been a christian feeling ; but I am not ashamed to confess that I slammed the door to after him, and wished him under the protection of that gentleman who superin tends the great fire. It is a long, long time since, and I have had time to cool ; but whenever I recall the conduct of that man my blood boils with indignation. He was cringing and fawning while getting money, but an unfeeling tyrant when there was a chance of losing it."], [25, "17 BEGINNING OF TROUBLE. \" Father,\" said I, \" can he have you arrested to-morrow ?\" \" If,\" said my father, \" by to-morrow he means the next time the sun rises, no ; but if by to-morrow he means a short time, yes. He can give instructions to-morrow to have me arrested, and when arrested, I must put in bail.* The law considers a debtor a criminal, just like a thief, only that the thief is considered innocent until he is found guilty, and a debtor is considered guilty until he is proved innocent. I am afraid very few alter their opinion even after he has obtained a verdict of acquittal.\" '' Father.\" said I, \" is there no way of avoiding this trouble ? Canuot we raise this money upon the stock we have. Can I do something ? Can I help you ? If not I am afraid I shall have to go and break his windows before my mind is at rest.\" \" No, no, my son, leave the matter to me. If I sell my stock to meet this claim, I must make a large sacrifice. This will but increase my embarrassment, and my customers will always want my goods at the same price. If I suffer myself to be arrested, my credit is gone, ruin will overtake me like a hungry wolf, lawyers will come upon me like so many beasts of prey. As when in a desert a traveller falls, vultures gather together from afar off and hover over him to devour him, so will these men come and take my property to themselves.\" I felt very sorry for my father. When in my boyish days I had seen him handle so much money and be so careful with it, I thought him but a skinflint, one who devoted his whole soul to gain, and would deny himself many of the comforts of life that he might become rich. As a boy, I thought life consisted of enjoyments, of the song and the dance, to keep on the sunny side of the way, to shut my eyes to its thorns, and to pluck only its flowers. To live was to live, and not to drone away the hours in a sleepy existence ; but time, and disappointment, and suffering have taugbt another creed. Many of the aspirations of youth I have found but fancies, fairy scenes which have passed away like the visions of night. \" Well,\" said my mother, \" I have always said man was a mystery, and the more I know of him the more mysterious he becomes. To think that Mr. Mincher should have turned upon us in this way. He who has always been so civil, so obliging, *Arreat on MeBne process is now abolished."], [26, "18 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. so very agreeable. He never passed me without shaking my hand ; when in his carriage he has kissed his hand to me witb a ' 'do, 'do,' ami the most fascinating smile. He takes our minister by the arm every Sunday, goes into the vestry with him, and seems such a kind, feeling, good religious man, I am sure I adored him. I thought if there was a saint upon earth, Mr. Mincher was the man. But he must have fallen away from grace, and uses religion as a cloak for covetousness. Who would believe me if I said how he served us. I should not have believed any one who told me this of him. How can I expect others to believe me? Well, well, I begin to think there is nothing but deceit in human nature. I hope something will turn up to restore my faith, else I shall think the original sin our minister talks about has never been atoned for. Who could have thought that so slight a thing as my son desiring to go to London should have brought so much trouble upon us. I know that when a man falls in love, it is a little thing that does it, and that little thing is the cause of much happiness or misery. Perhaps drawing on the glove with a downcast modest look. Perhaps a glance when noboby else is looking. Perhaps reading out of the same prayer book and accidentally bringing each other's heads together. Perhaps taking refuge from a shower of rain under tbe same shelter. Perhaps walking under the same umbrella. Perhaps standing at the garden gate. Perhaps singing a song. Perhaps receiving a pair of slippers. Perhaps a valentine Perhaps crushing at the theatre door. Perhaps touching each other's hands at a prayer mseting. There are many ways by which people fall in love, if they happen at the right time, that is when they both feel lovisb. I have often laughed at how your father fell in love with me. I was making some apple dumplings. I gave him the rolling pin, and asked him to roll out the dough for me. He began to do it. I laughed at him to see how awkward he was when trying to do women's work. He untied my apron string for laughing at him I dusted him all over with flour. He became wicked, and ran me up in a corner and kissed me. I said, ' Go away, you fellow,' and seemed angry ; but you know, John, girls are not angry, they only seem so ; they like it. It was the rolling pin that made your father fall in love. Now you know it was, and you need uot"], [27, "BEGINNING OF TROURLE. 19 contradict me. I have blest the rolling pin ever since, for it was the beginning of my happiness. But to think so slight a thing as my son desiring to go to London should be the beginning of trouble. If he arrests you, speak up to the Judge in your own defence. Tell him it was not any sin or wickedness of yours which caused you to be brought before him, but that of others. Tell him you have been punished enough by swindlers, and that it is not just that the law should punish you as well. Tell him that Mr. Mincher has got a great deal of money out of you, and that he is a deceitful scoundrel. Give it him well ; and if the Judge be a righteous Judge, as he ought to be, he will acquit you.\" \" Yes,\" said I, as innocently as my mother, \" tell him how it was, then he will not let Mr. Mincher use the law lo oppress you.\" My father looked at me and my mother with such an expres sion of loving pity as made me feel ashamed. \" My son,\" said he, \" there is much injustice practised by legal men, by means of legal forms, which never comes before the Judge, but the Judge does not look at the origin of the matter he is called upon to decide, nor at how it has been conducted. A knave may by skill make use of the forms of justice to entrap an innocent being ; he may surround him with snares from which it is impossible for him to escape ; he will try to break through, but the Judge will hold him to his engagements, however obtained. He looks but at the matter before him ; he heeds not whether it had its origin in heaven or whether its every feature proclaims it a child of hell ; no matter whether it be just or wicked, he will not travel out of the record.\""], [28, "20 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER V WANT OF MONEY Of all the powers which hold sway in this world, there is none so omnipotent as gold. It rules the court, the camp, the forum, the courts of justice, and the shrines before wbich men bow down to worship the great and awful Majesty of Heaven. That great leveller, love, to whose magical fascinations all yield, surrendeis to gold the palm. Beauty may contend for empire, but gold gains the victory. In the market-place it holds undivided sway. It triumphs over all the dangers those men suffer who go down to the sea in ships. On the exchange, where merchants congregate, no other power sets its foot. With it at his command, the tiny, deformed, and ugly dwarf is more than a match for the handsome athlete, whose vigour and whose form is the triumph and the master-piece of (iod. Before it genius quails, aud surrenders to it like a timid thing, its wit, its wisdom, and its ethereal fires. To it is made subservient the wind which wafts the rich argosies freighted with the wealth of both worlds from one hemisphere to the other. For it the mountain is pierced, and the mighty power of steam, the child of genius, hurries ou with ceaseless stroke. For it man plies at the sickly loom, sweats at the sweltering forge, bores in the danger ous mine, plods at the noxious trade, and nervously works by the midnight lamp. For it he leaves father and mother, sisters and brothers, and all the social blessings with which kind nature has surrounded him, and traverses distant seas, threads tbe primeval forests, braves the barren deserts, and treads the solitary wilds in which no human foot has trod since God said \" Let there be light, and there was light.\" Yes, gold is omnipotent ; and can we wonder? For who would be king, if the civil"], [29, "WANT OF MONEY. 21 list were no greater than a peasant's pay ? Who would sit in judgment to decide the quarrels of men, if there were no salary but thanks, and no fee but gratitude ? Who would conduct a gorgeous and ceremonious ritual, or be shepherd in the fold whose sheep are the souls of men, for the wage which satisfied the fishermen of Galilee ? The martyr's crown is a crown of thorns, and looking down tbe vista of the past, we see tbat here and there it has been worn by noble heads, before whom all mankind should bow in homage- But who does so ? At long intervals a pilgrim with his staff and his scrip bends at their shrine with awe and regret, but the world turns away with cool indifference, and worships with the abject meanness of eastern slaves the god who sits upon the throne of gold. It was fabled of old, and the states of Greece contended for the honour of the fiction, that in the search for the Golden Fleece, Jason sowed the ground with teeth which produced a crop of armed men ; but gold will now produce a crop of armed men without ploughing the ground with bulls with brazen feet and nostrils of fire, and sowing it with the teeth of the serpent which Cadmus slew. It was fabled of old that in the golden age the nymphs and swains were pure and fond, tending their flocks during the day, and at evening, when golden suns lighted up with lustrous light the extensive landscape, the birds languishing in song, and the lion submitting to be led as a lamb by a little child ; the nymphs and swains danced by the hill side with the most unmoved simplicity to the rude but luscious strains of the pipe and the tabor. All were happy. Labour brought health, and health brought enjoyment. Sin had not entered the world then. It was the golden age. But avarice was born. Then came the age of gold, and all the fictions are embellished with a garniture of gold. Golden eagles fraternise with golden peacocks. Golden suns shine in golden hemi spheres. Golden palaces are surmounted with golden canopies. Golden halls are fitted with golden furniture, lighted with golden candlesticks and golden lamps. The kings rest their feet upon golden footstools, and sit upon golden thrones, sur rounded by princes oppressed with the weight of golden jewels. Gold was then the god, gold is now the god, and will be so although time should prove it to be like the golden apples"], [30, "22 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. the poets sing of, all glory and brightness to the sight, but ashes and disappointment to the touch. Oh, would the great God would come down from heaven, and with the all-creating power he has, restore the golden age again. We lament that the golden age is past, but what do we mortals do ? We indoctrinate our children in the creed whose chief article is gold. As soon as their little hands can clutch and toss a plaything, we fill them with golden baubles. The first lesson we give them is the use of gold. '1 he first game they play is \" Here I am, oa Tom Tinker's ground, Picking up gold and silver.\" We feed them, if we can, with a golden spoon. We pierce their ears and fill them with golden rings. We teach them to read out of a golden primer, and even gild their gingerbread. They write their names with golden pens. They court with golden presents, and wed with golden rings. They put up signs, and on them write the trade they follow in letters of gold. They seek their amusements at a theatre which is all gilt with gold. They pay their devotions at a church whose mouldings are all gold. When ill, they pay the doctor with a golden fee. When they quarrel the law drains away heaps of gold, until they quarrel no more. Wrhen they die we put them in a coffin on which we write their names in letters of gold ; and we pray, devoutly pray, that they may pass through golden skies into a heaven whose pavement is pure gold. If we give them examples we desire them to follow it is not the virtuous and the noble, but the wealthy, the men who have been successful and become rich. We tell them how by plodding industry, rising with the lark and lying down with the lamb, adding guinea to guinea, and gold to gold, living upon scanty fare, and sleeping upon a hard couch, a man died worth a million of gold. If there be a man who devotes himself to ameliorate the miseries which ever accom pany sin we call him au enthusiast, and think him a little cracked. If there be a man who, hearing the wail of slavery coming from afar, calling upon free Britain to help the slaves, if he answer that call we say he was a good man, but rather touched. If there be a man who devotes himself heart and soul to the improvement of his fellows, we wonder if there be any"], [31, "23 WANT OF MONEY. insanity in his family. But if we see a man striving with heart and soul through a long life with one aim and one thought to store up a heap of gold until it amounts to a million, we praise him with unbounded praises, we admire him with ceaseless admiration, we honour him with the highest honours, and we worship him with a worship which it is blasphemy to offer to any but tbe Divinity himself. And doing all this, we rail at the age in which we live, and lament that it pays its highest honours to filthy lucre. Oh, man, hew inconsistent thou art ! Call not upon the powers that be to enact sumptuary laws to prevent thy fellows strutting about in silk attire with all the gaudy pride of a peacock, because thou art condemned to toddle through the world in fustian. \" John,\" said my father, \" mind the warehouse, and I will go and see if I can make any arrangement to meet Mr. Mincher's claim. It is true tbat it is not yet due, according to the terms of credit ; but he is not the sort of man to be stopped by trifles. He thinks the game is up, and he will get what he can before tbe scramble comes. Men like him care not what amount of trouble they take into a household, nor how many hearts they make desolate. They care for nothing but to save their money. They will boast of their shrewd- ness, cleverness, and skill, while those to whom bitter expe- rience has given a true knowledge of the world, its ways, and its difficulties, too well know that the shrewdness is but covetous- ness, the cleverness but fear, and the skill the cruelty which is hardened by avarice. The only punishment I can desire such persons to receive is to be thrown into the midst of difficulties, and let them see of what use is their shrewdness, cleverness, and skill. If any one comes, you say I have gone out on business, and shall be home again in about two hours ; and let me enjoin on you and your mother never to say I am not at home when I am anywhere about tbe premises or in the house. If I am denied that is an act of bankruptcy. Mr. Mincher will not say anything about my affairs until he has got his claim settled. He may then boast a little about his shrewdness \u2014 his boasting will alarm others of his kind \u2014 for he is but an individual of his class, a class which is much too numerous. They will come upon me with the same fears he has, and perhaps treat me with as much"], [32, "24 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. harshness. We must be very watchful, for all our actions will be narrowly scanned. People will look upon us witb the theory that we shall fail, and the most innocent of looks, of words, and of actions will be construed into convincing evidences of the theory they have formed. Some men are like the surgeons who have no way to cure a diseased leg but to cut it off ; then boast of the cleverness of the operation. That operation is a disgrace to them, for they ought to have cured the leg \u2014 nature is ever ready to assist \u2014 and not hide their own ignorance by their am putating skill. So some clumsy tradesmen and lawyers have no way of curing a sickly estate but by sending the tradesman to prison and putting the estate into bankruptcy. They call that skill. Poor souls it may be so to them, for they know no better. What is consummate skill to the little mind is awkwardness and blundering to the one of large experience.\" With these reflections my father left. My father was in general a man of few words. He was said to be taciturn, and so he was upon most occasions ; but when roused no man could pour forth words with greater volubility ; his ideas seemed to grow upon him as he discoursed, and as he was a man of great observation, he poured forth such stores of knowledge, sparkling in such various lights, as was truly astonishing. A stranger would think that the subject of conversation was his especial study, but those who knew him were aware that it was but one of the many kinds of information he possessed. \" Well,\" said my mother, \" it seems as if people had become short of money all at once. One wants his money because he is so short, and another wants his money because he is so short. I never saw the like. It's money, money, money, nothing but money ; I wish money had never been invented. The man who did invent it must have been of a malicious temper ; for it is the cause of more evils in the world than anything else. It seems the only study of some men how they can get money from their fellows. It's money for this, and money for that, and money for everything. Here's your father, he is threatened to be arrested for money. Mr. Biteum, the lawyer, will arrest him at Mr. Mincher's suit. It is not the love of justice which makes Mr. Biteum take this office, but the money which he gets by it. The bailiff who will take your father to prison has no malicious feeling"], [33, "WANT OF MONEY. 25 against him, I'll be bound ; but he wants the money. The gaoler who keeps the prison has no pleasure in seeing men grieve in confinement ; at least, I should think not ; he wauts the money it brings. You cannot have justice done you without money. How very true is the prcverb that ' It is money makes the mare go.' \" At the time about which I am writing there existed in Birmingham streets Galled King Street, Colmore Street, Queen Street, and Peck Lane. These have all been swept away, and upon their sites has been erected the London and North-Western Railway Station. Numerous Jewish pedlars lived there. I hey were supplied by the shops kept by persons of their own nation. Many a time have I stood looking at the glittering wares dis played in their windows. The rows upon rows of beads, the rings, the brooches, the charms, the bosom pins, the studs, the bracelets, and all the gauds of which ladies are so fond. Boy as I was, I thought if my father could have the order to make all the jewellery they sold, how busy he would be. I have many a time looked at those merchants, as we now call them, as they stood round a public house near the Parsonage, in Smallbrook Street, with their grey eyes, their hooked noses, their short upper lips, and their long beards, with something of the feeling of veneration ; for I knew that they had the power lo give my father very large orders. I bave stood among them listening to their Hebrew gibberish as they were chaffering and changing with much warmth, and, as I thought, want of temper. To me the comparison, \" as rich as a Jew,\" was an expression of superlative wealth, and \" to be jewed,\" of superlatively wicked sharpness. I remember well a saying of Mr. Aaron, an ancient Hebrew of those days, who was full of bitter humour, when asked which he thought the greatest jew, meaning a trading cheat, said, \" Do you mean a Jewish jew or a Christian jew.\" \" Well, but,\" said the querist, \" there can only be Hebrew Jews.\" \" I beg your pardon. The Jew is a Jew according to the manner of his creed and his natiou. He is taught and commanded to spoil the Egyptians. But the Christian jew is a jew against his creed ; he is taught to do as he would be done by ; but a Jew is taught to do all people that on earth do dwell. The palm I give to the Christian jew, and there is no jew in all this world who"], [34, "26 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. is so worthy to wear it.\" If it were not that I might be considered as bitter as Mr. Aaron, I should write my endorse ment on the back of this with a steady hand. Many of the shops in those streets were called \" Slaughter Shops.\" Did you ever have the misfortune to know the meaning of that adjective from your own experience ? If so, give me your hand, and let me shake it in sorrow. Ah, Sir, it is a sad experience ; and if troubles are sent for our purification we must be as pure as thrice-refined gold. Many a time have I seen a young man commence business with a small capital, and hopes and expectations, which, were they capital, his resources would be as great as the Bank of England. Flattering himself with the thought that if ever he should be unable to sell his goods in the right market \u2014 but he never would be unable \u2014 he could always sell them at the ready money shops. I have seen them go into one for the first time with all a young man's hopes \u2014 which for an old man to dash is the extreme of cruelty \u2014 and offer their goods for what they thought a large reduction for cash, but ultimately been obliged to sell them for one half of what they have cost. Such cases are called \" the slaughter of the innocents.\" When they have gone again there was no buoyant step, the elasticity of youth was gone, and care, with its furrows, had aged them many a year. If they once go, the necessity of meeting their engagements compels them to go again, and soon. But let us throw a veil over the sorrows of the young tradesman ; let us not tread among the ruins of broken hopes and broken hearts, but give him this advice instead : Lodge humbly, live upon scanty fare, spend not a farthing you can by any means save, keep up the price for your goods, make no article for less than it costs to entice the sale of others, let the quality of your goods be the best, treat your workpeople as if they were your children, not too indulgently, nor too severely ; never neglect your business to attend to that which is only suitable to men of leisure. Then your difficulties will in time surrender, and the light heart, the independent bearing, and the firm step of the successful tradesman will tell the world the difficulties incidental to trade are conquered. The situation I have described was full of Hebrews, indeed it was called the Old Jewry of Birmingham. There was"], [35, "27 WANT OF MONEY. Moses Aaron, maker of cedar pencils, sealing wax, and wafers ; there was David Solomon, dealer in quills and pens j there was Barney Isaacs, maker of spectacles and barnacles j there was Micah Myers, dealer in watches ; there was Mordecai Benjamin, importer of Turkey rhubarb ; there was Emanuel Nathan, importer of beads, cameos, and precious stones ; there was Moses Joel, who did little else than wet his clay, smoke his pipe, and stagger through Old Jewry ; there was the Turkish Jew, with the red and white turban and flowing robes j there was the Armenian Jew, with his peaked hat, his long serge cloak, his shoes held together with brass latchets, and his two small eyes peeping over the top of his face, which was as well covered with hair as a broom is with bristles. But they are all gone now. In those days there was a Jewish representative of all nations constantly fluctuating in and out of Old Jewry, with their varied and many-coloured costumes, which told me as a boy that there were other lands people lived in besides England, and other languages besides my own. I thought them all learned Rabbis, who knew their own Hebrew tongue, spoken by Jews in whatever part of the world they may have been scattered, and the languages of all those lands through which it was their calling to travel. I thought that if they were scattered as a nation, in punishment for sins committed by their forefathers ages upon ages ago, their sufferings had been severe and long enough for their sins to be forgiven ; that the vengeance that scattered them should now relent and forgive. But I was a boy, and was told not to judge with my judgment things that were too mysterious for men. I have often wondered why we do not now see the variety of costume we saw then. Do the Jews conform to the fashions of the age, or have the foreign Jews left off travelling? It were a speculation worthy to be examined, but not now. In Queen Street there was a house which looked like a private house. It had three stone steps to the door ; on the door was a brass knocker, a brass knob, and a brass plate ; upon the brass plate was engraved \" Emanuel Levy.\" The door and the window shutters were painted a bright emerald green. It was the finest-looking house there, and seemed like a dandy in dirt. The young Jewesses, and they were many, with their black eyes,"], [36, "28 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. their bright raven hair, their cheeks covered with a bloom like that of the peach, were dressed in rich clothing, and at the full of the fashion. They seemed to me the handsomest ladies in Birmingham, and have left an impression which no other beauty has ever effaced, no production of the painter's art has ever equalled, and no form upon which tbe poet has exercised his gorgeous imagination, and around which he has thrown his enchantments, has ever excelled. They moved along those streets with a grace and a charm beyond compare. I have not seen them for many, many years now, and I should not like to see the changes which time must have made in their beauty, for they might efface the matchless picture which my young imagination formed. To me it seems that beauty should ever be young ; should ever flourish in pristine loveliness, like the stars of heaven, which have the same glory now as when Jacob laid his head upon the pillow of stone, or Abraham climbed the mountain to offer sacrifice, or David listened to their language in rapt silence or sang their praises in witching song. When I afterwards knew the greedy and avaricious character of their father, I thought them much too good to be children of his. It was a false inference, for I have many times since seen worthy beings whom I have held in the highest estimation, the children of unworthy parents, and I have seen children unworthy of the mother who bore them \u2014 which ought never to be. The mother should be loved with a love which knows no abatement. She sorrowed in travail for us ; she guarded us in infancy, with a jealous fondness ; she watched over us in sickness, and stilled every little noise that we might sleep. From her hand we take medicine in preference to any other hand in the world. If we are waked from sleep by fearful dreams, \"Mother, mother!\" is the first cry we make for help. In trouble she is the first in counsel and in comfort. A mother's love is more ardent than any other love with which man is ever blessed. The child may forget her, but she never forgets her child. If fortune takes him afar, she welcomes the ship with tears which brings intelligence of her absent one. If her child turns upon her with ingratitude, she grieves, but her love never fails. '1 he father's love may be stern and just, but the mother's is often blind, and always forgiving. The sickly one she doats upon ; the wicked one, who"], [37, "WANT OF MONEY. 29 almost breaks her heart, she prays for in secret, grieves for in tears. and loves with a fondness which no sin and no ingratitude can abate. Nay, she has more love for us than the great and good God, fcr he will punish us for sins \u2014 she would wipe them all out. Emanuel Levi was about the middle height, spare in make ; his body formed au angle with his legs, so that his figure slightly partook of the back lines of the letter K ; his hair was a glossy black ; his eyebrows were bright and full, meeting together with a dipping curve ; he had thin lips ; his whiskers appeared to be curled with irons ; his manner was agreeable and soliciting ; his temper was firm, yielding only when there was nothing to be gained by firmness ; never passionate, but a close observer could see that, although his language was suave and agreeable, sometimes his frame would tremble as under the influence of suppressed passion. When trading he was acute, penetrating, aud persevering \u2014 looking his customers firmly in the face, watching keenly for the least sign which could betray the effect of his language. He frequently, rather than abate his price or lose his customer, con cluded the bargain standing upon the stone steps which stood before his door. He was unscrupulous in getting money ; pity never infused one drop of sympathy into his composition; he did not know its meaning, and treated with indifference or con tempt its exhibition in others. No doubt he had his place in the designs of nature, just as have the hemlock, the adder, and the stealthy fox. It was to him my father went for assistance. He had seen but one side of his character, had he seen both, as he afterwards declared, he never would have gone to him for help. To be deceived did not reflect upon my father's judgment, for the true character of man is not known until poverty supplicates his aid, and those who have been wealthy are chilled by the cold shade of misfortune The crowd will shout in triumph around the victor's car, but they are kind hearts indeed who seek the retirement of the vanquished, and help him in his defeat."], [38, "30 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER VI. HELP. Emanuel Levy received my father in his usual urbane manner; but as the visit was altogether unexpected on his part, he was cautious and reserved, careful not to commit himself in any way until my father's object in calling upon him was obvious ; and as that was a very disagreeable one, my father talked about many things that were altogether irrelevant. Mr. Levy made several attempts to fish out his intention, but as he had not divined what that was, he was completely at fault. He seemed about to treat the visit as one of mere general gossip, to which he had devoted all the time he could spare. My father picked up a brooch, and turned it over and over in a listless and uueasy manner. His thoughts were not upon that ; pride, and the fear that the hope he had formed might be blighted, made him silent. The mental pain which for the moment he endured was punish- ment euough for sin, and no righteous judge who ever sat upou the seat of justice would have made it the penalty for misfortune. There are robust minds who would have gone through the trial and not have felt the pain \u2014 who would have asked the question without fear, and have received an unfavourable answer with a curse ; it would then have passed through their minds like a meteor's flight, without leaving a trace behind. But my father's feelings were most sensitive. Things which upon other minds would leave no mark would sear his ; clouds which to others would hide no sunshine would chill aud depress him ; words which others would treat as idle sounds would carry to him all, and perhaps more meaning than was intended. I have often heard him say that he would not exchange his quick sensibilities, with all the increase of feeling they brought him, for the"], [39, "HELP, 31 dullard's soul, from which sorrow could draw no tear, aud mirth never rouse the exhilarating laugh. As he turned the brooch over and over iu his haud, his eyes were upon it. Mr. Levy stood looking at. him, and spoke no word. His knowledge of human nature told him something was coming from which he might hope to gain ; and as my father said he had some stock which he was anxious to turn into money, aud was ready to make a sacrifice for that purpose, the tension under which Mr. Levi's mind had been, relaxed. While my father was talking to him he looked out of the window, up and down the street, then at the drawers which contained his stock, then left the warehouse (for the parlour was his warehouse), returned again apparently pre-occupied and busy. He did not answer the question my father put to him, but called to his daughter for some frivolous thing or other. When my father repealed his request he turned round suddenly and stared at him as if struck with the greatest astonishment. Without making any reply he agaiu looked through the window, up and down the street, thea turning his back upon my father, re-examined his drawers, and looked about as if he had lost something. It was not to look for any thing he made this fidgety display, for he opened no drawers excepting those which contained stock, but to exhibit his stock and to appear perfectly indifferent to the offer my father was about to make. When he did speak, he thought he had played with the fish, and fairly hooked his sport. He said he had serious thoughts of giving up business altogether ; it was a trouble to him and so little was got by jewellery that it was not worth his while to trouble himself for so small a return. A time was he could now and then make a good sale which made it worth his while, but people had become so well skilled in the value of jewellery, that there was no chance to get anything. Besides, fashion might change ; what was in request one day people would not look at another. He was already encumbered with old-fashioned stock, and he could not think of increasing it under any temptation. My father said that with ninety pounds he could meet his present wants ; that he had over four hundred pounds worth of stock, all modern patterns, and that if he chose to select one hundred pounds' worth, he might have"], [40, "32 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. it for ninety pounds in cash. He turned round upon my father and said with the greatest contempt, \" Puff.\" As it was uncertain whether this contemptuous expression was given because so small a sum was required, my father explained why he had become embarrassed to that amount. My father was what some people call a simple man in business. He always told the truth. He was not given to braggadocio. He would not live beyond his means on purpose to give a false idea of wealth, that credit might be given him. He would not practise any of those arts by which men become splendid bankrupts \u2014 failing for thirty thousand or more \u2014 and therefore are respected by all those who get large sums out of such estates, and are patted and encouraged, and flattered and complimented, by men who are appointed to see justice done. The great villain wins admiration, but tbe little scoundrel may go and be \u2014 no matter what \u2014 for it is right little can be got out of him. My father had for his motto \u2014 \" It is better to be poor and honest than to win by pretensions and brag that to wliich he had no just claim.\" That is not the way of the world, nor is it the highway to high places among men. The world is so made that external show and unbounded pretension obtain high honour while modest merit frets in obtcurity. \" I do not want your stock, nor any of it,\" said Mr. Levy ; \" I would not give you fifty pounds for the pick of one hundred pounds' worth. It might lie by me several years, until it became old fashioned. Some of it I might never sell. Of what use would ten pounds be to me ? the common interest of money where there is no risk would yield me more than that paltry sum. Ten pounds ! W hy, Sir, do you think I pick my money up in the street, or that I have got so much that I do not know what to do with it, and am ready to make a present of it to any Christian fellow who asks me for it? You will allow me ten pounds, will you? Ten pounds! That is a very large temptation, indeed ! I suppose you think my nation are so wealthy and so greedy that you have only to offer them just a little temptation, and they will obey your beck and call at all times. Ten pounds ! that is a mighty sum \u2014 so large that I really wonder at your liberality. Sir, I can get jewellery for less than half what you can sell it at. Look here, Sir,\" continued he, at the same time pulling out a drawer,"], [41, "33 HELP \" you know something about these things. What would be your price for all that lot \u2014 garnets, rubies, diamonds, and all. Come, now, you know something about such things. How much ? What do you say now? What would you give me for that lot ?\" \" 1 am not a buyer, ' said my father, made rather meek by Mr. Levy's manner. \" I do not say you are a buyer. I merely say if you were a buyer what would you be willing to give ? What do you think they are worth, now ? There are a hundred rings, fifty of them diamonds ; eighty brooches, half of them with diamonds ; three dozen pairs of ear-rings, one dozen set with brilliants ; and one dozen cameos. There they are now \u2014 the jewels of the first water, and every article assayed and marked. Tell me what you think they are worth.\" My father looked at them very carefully, and then said he could not make them for less than two hundred pounds. \" Two huudred pounds,\" said Mr. Levy, in his blandest manner, spreading out both his hands, and politely bowing ; well, if you choose to buy them, you shall have them for one hundred, and I shall then clear thirty pounds by them. There, now, you see I am not anxious to have all the good things to myself. I shall be satisfied with thirty pounds ; you can sell them and get a hundred.\" He waved his hand as if he had said something grand and conclusive, replaced the drawer, then thrusting his hands into his pockets, turned round, and looked at my father most triumphantly. \" Now,\" said he, \"what sort of a tempta tion do you think your ten pounds is?\" \" Why,\" said my father, \"though I am very much pressed for the money, I cannot sacrifice my property in the way you indicate.\" \" In the way I indicate, my good man ! I indicate nothing. I bought those this morning If you have any desire to sell your stock you must make a larger abatement than you propose. Why, Sir, old as you are, you know nothing of the way of the world. It is one thing to make goods to order, and another thing to sell goods for which you have no order.\" My father turned away to leave, the hopes be had formed were blighted and gone. He felt, as he had often said, least fit of men to play the part of man. \"Now,\" said Mr. Levy, to my father, \" I will tell you what I will do. I have often dealt with you and have sound you honest as the world goes. I do not think you would impose upon me ; and as you B"], [42, "34 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. are not likely to sell your goods at such a price as I can afford to give \u2014 for you see I could not afford to give any more than I can get them at \u2014 these things I have to keep and sell when I can. When 1 order from you I order for an order.\" \" Do those people who sell you goods at such large sacrifices as that pay their way, or do they fail?\" said my father. \"I really do not know, and what is more, I do not care ; I have my business to attend to, and it is my business to mind my business, and not trouble about other people's business. We must all live, my good Sir, somehow. If they cannot live upon the profits they make, they must live upon the debts they contract. They must either live upon their debtors or upon their creditors. It is all one to you and me, my good Sir \u2014 they live. We are men of business ; and it would not do for us to set about correcting all the siu we see in the world. It is too large a job. Leave such things to the bishops and the priests, and those others who are paid for it. You and I must mind our business. Now, I will tell you what I will do. You appear to be pressed for niuety pounds, and are willing to give ten pounds for the accommoda tion. I will let you have ninety pounds for four months upon yourj giving me your own bond for one hundred. You know there will be two hundred put in the bond ; but that is a mere matter of form, you know, and does not mean anything. Your lawyers, you see, are so buried in forms that they keep up the names of John Doe and Richard Roe as if they were eutities, whereas they have been nonentities for ages. It is very silly. Yet it is the wisdom of ages, you know ; and there is no one who can tell now when that wisdom was folly \u2014 the mere witticism of some wag of a conveyancer who could laugh in wardly and not smile outwardly. You know, Sir, the wit of one man is often the creed of another. Perhaps you may not be able to pay me just to a day. I shall not be hard with you. And we may as well have a little fun in our law as any one else. Suppose we put in the deed that if the money be not paid at the time it shall be chargeable with an interest of sixteen per cent. Ha ! ha ! ha ! a merry thought \u2014 a very merry thought ! \u2014 the lawyer will charge the same for drawing up the bond, and we will make him work for it. Ha ! ha 1 ha ! we will steal a march upon him. If he charges high we will make him do"], [43, "35 HELP some work for it. I will give instructions at once, and you can have the money this afternoon. You could not have been served better if you had gone to a Christian for it, instead of coming to a Jew.\" My father did not like the form the negotiation had taken ; but he felt so confident of being able to meet the engagement that he did not attach as much import ance to it as he ought to have done. As he left for home Mr. Levy thrust both hands deep into his pockets, sunk his head into his shoulders, and said, \" I have you now, my man, and you will have to lose many a feather before I let you go again.\" At that time my father was all to me \u2014 I knew his every thought and his every action \u2014 and I thought that angel who enters into the Book of Life the deeds of men, whether they have been good or evil, would look down upon the trans action, and record it faithfully."], [44, "36 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER VII. MY FATHER'S BECIPE. \" John,\" said my father, when he returned from Mr. Levy's, \" make out Mr. Mineher's account, and let me see how it stands.'' It was my father's practice to have his accounts added up in pencil marks, unless it was bis intention to settle them \u2014 then he had them added up in ink and ruled off. I did not like to ask him directly if he had got the money which had been so peiemptorily demanded, but, knowing the meaning of his prac tice, I said, \" Shall I add it up in ink ?\" \" Yes,\" said he, \" rule it, and prepare it for a balance.\" \" That is right,\" said my mother ; \" and I hope we shall never have anything more to do with him.\" When my father returned she had looked into his face quite as anxiously as did any prisoner into the face of the jury when about to deliver their verdict, the thought when my father said \" rule it,\" that the game was won. She threw her head back in a self-satisfied attitude of proud triumph, which said, better than any words could possibly say, \"we are quite as good as him yet.\" \"Ah,\" said she, \" Mr. Mincher is a very nice sort of a man, I dare say, but I have found him out if other people have not, and I mean to tell our minister what sort of a sanctimonious hypocrite he is ; and I mean to say this that if he does not take him to task, and preach a sermon for his especial benefit, on sanctimonious hypocrisy, we will give up our sittings. I never did like to travel in a coach which was removing felons from one prison to another, and I never shall. Burn me if I should like to go to heaven by the same conveyance as Mr. Mincher. He is a favourite with our minister, and sits on the box with him, and I should be 6orely afraid that under his direc tion the coach would be driven to the wrong place. That might"], [45, "MY FATHER'S RECIPE. 37 be right for him, but it would not do for me. It is all very well for a coachman to have some one to give him a good dinner now and then, and a glass of something good at every stage ; it is very pleasaut, I have no doubt, but a coachman as is a coachman has got a kind heart, and will think of the poor woman who is sitting behind almost perishing with the cold, and will have a good word for her now and then. I do not like a minister who has a great pleasure in attending the rich, who give good dinners now and then, and only waits on the poor because it is his duty, or that be may have examples of great condescension and goodness on his part to lay before a tea meeting \u2014 a minister who when the rich are ill is all attention, but when the poor are ill sends his curate. I will say this that a minister is with me as he is with every woman, a dear good man ; but he must be a minister in truth, and not one because it is a gentlemanly calling with nothing to do. There are those who have as much as ever they can do to keep up the respectable appearance which is expected of them, I knew, and I say it is a shame that some should almost starve while others roll about in carriages, only that they may keep up the dignity of religion, as they say ; but I say where there is so much dignity, religion loses all utility. What sympathy can carriage people have with those who are lowly of spirit ? They stand upon a pinnacle so lofty that they can only look down upon tbe broken and contrite heart. They may patronise it or scold it, but that feeling which would not bruise a broken reed must be all unknown to them. I hope our minister is not afraid of Mr. Mincher or any one else, but when he knows he has sin to correct, will correct it whether it is in high places or low places. I hope he knows better than to flatter the rich, and do all his scolding upon the poor. If he be not independent, I hope he will confine himself to praising Jesus Christ, and scolding the devil \u2014 then he can offend nobody.\" I began to feel relieved by my father's success as well as my mother, and to devise all sorts of schemes to punish Mr. Mincher for bis selfishness. I proposed to tell all with whom he had any dealings what a griping and grasping fellow he was. I supposed that I had only to go forth and publish his misdeeds, and all people would scorn and execrate him as I did. I had not then dis-"], [46, "38 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. covered that the desire of gain is so omnipotent that neither sin nor virtue can oppose any check to its power, or withdraw any one of its votaries fiom its pursuit. My father said he hoped to be able to master the difficulty, and therefore let it pass. There are many things in life that we must endure as best we may, and forget them as soon as possible. We must treat them as we do wet, uncomfortable days, or as the be chilling east wind, which we must endure and forget. \" Ah, that is always the way of you,\" said my mother ; \" take it easy is your faith ; keep out of trouble is your motto. Sip your brandy and water, and smoke your cigar, and let every thing that is wrong wriggle itself right, is what you say ; but I should like to know where the world would be if everybody held that doctrine. Just nowhere. There would be no new patterns ; no new fashions ; no new bonnets ; no new dresses ; no new anything It would go on in rags, or patch, patch, patch, for ever. The old house might tumble down, you would never build a new one. It is old days, old things, old songs, old everything with you.\" \" No,\" said my father, \" you are wrong there ; it is young women for me.\" \" There,\" replied my mother, giving my father a playful box on the ears, \" take that ! you had better not let me catch you with any of your young minxes. I will let them know, and you, too, if I catch you at any of your gaieties. I am getting old, am I ? you are tired of me, are you ? I have found you out, have I ? It is the young minxes, is it, why you are so altered a man ? When I was young I was your duck and your darling. There were no endearing words too sweet for me. You have many a time told me in a whisper, as if you did not wish the canary bird to hear, how much you loved me ; but young minxes are taking my place, are they ? I know that when young the man follows the woman, but when they are married the woman follows the man. But you are not content with that, you have your young minxes. Oh, you men, you men ! what plagues you are to us women ! You break our hearts when young, and despise us when we get old. The happiest days of all a woman's life are the courting days. She is petted, flattered, and admired then. She is called by all the endearing names a loving heart can invent. She is taken out to balls, and theatres, and parties."], [47, "MY FATHER'S RECIPE. 39 If she drop her fan, the gentleman is too happy to present it to her with a witching grace; if she mislay her glove, it is anxiously sought for, and given to her with the blandest smiles ; if she intimate a wish, it is fulfilled ; if she express a desire, it is gratified ; if she move from the ball room to the dressing room, a shawl is carefully placed across her shoulders, for fear what the gentleman calls ' his dear b'ttle fairy ' should be chilled. AVhen she leaves she is handed to her carriage with the most devoted attention. Iu summer the gayest flowers are laid at her feet, and when the evening sun goes down the western sky, which is all bemottled with myriads of gold and silver clouds, an arm embraces her waist, and the most delicious vows are breathed in her ear. Heigho ! I wish the courting days lasted for ever. If my time has to be gone over again when I get to the next world, I will take care not to be married so soon. When she is married how tbe case is altered ! It is Polly do this, Polly do that. It is Polly here, and Polly there, and Polly everywhere. Polly, bring my slippers. Polly, brew me a glass of brandy and water, and light my pipe aud bring a spittoon. Polly, I am going to my club. If they should happen to go to a party together, when they leave, it is Polly, tie my comforter round my neck. Before marriage the man is all devoted to the woman ; after, the woman is all devoted to the man. Before, she is his angel ; after, she is his drudge and slave. She sits at home all the day, and late at night. She must put up with his humours ; she must hear all the vexations he has had to endure all the day ; and must console and comfort when, poor thing, she wants to be consoled and comforted herself. O man, man, you do not know what we poor women endure for you ! \" \" Come, come,\" said my father, \" now let us attend to business.\" \" That is always the way with you,\" replied my mother, \"when I begin to talk to you for your own good, you are always so full of business you cannot awhile to listen. I am sure I am always striving for your benefit, and this is the way I get rewarded. I believe it is quite true that this world is very queerly governed.

II you will oblige me by accepting it I will order it home for you. I enquired the price; they want a guinea for it.\" My mother's eyes sparkled when my father said this, she put her left hand upon his right shoulder, and looked up in his face beaming with delight. Love filled her heart, and she was happy. The bonnet was ordered home. It was tried on. It suited perfectly. She said my father's taste so became her that she could not wish for any one but he to buy ber bonnets and her dresses. She was so proud she felt as if she were being courted again. When we had done business at night and went into the parlour, there was such a bright cheerful fire. My mother went down upon her knees to put my father's slippers on his feet. She filled his pipe, placed everything ready to his hand, brewed him a glass of brandy and water \" hot witb,\" gave him a lighted spill, put her hands upon his knees, and sat looking over the top of ber spectacles at my father, full of happiness and joy. As my father sipped bis toddy, he said, \" My dear, did you put more spirit than usual into this glass ? \" \" No, love,\" said she ; but it was said with such a rougish leer that you could see that she had committed a sin when she said \" No \" \" 1 hen,\" said my father, \" the brandy gets stronger as it gets older,\" and they looked over their spectacles at each other just as if they had fell in love, and were beginning courting again. Now this, you see, was my father's way. He knew that my mother was a really good woman, however much she at times seemed desirous of giving advice, and though he would some times taunt her in a joking and humorous way, he was really in love with her, which some people call very foolish. But his conduct was peculiar. Whenever he saw a little misunder standing about to arise he did not go into a huff, or put as much acid as possible into his words, or slam the door, or sulk, or scold, or use any of the weapons which are in repute in matrimonial wars. He never used a defiant tone, nor held up"], [49, "MY FATHER'S RECIPE. 41 his fist to threaten on purpose to frighten the other belligerent, but he bought a new dress, or a new shawl, or a new bonnet, and he always came off the victor. Tbe lowering storm gave way to sunshine and smiles, and that domestic affection which ought a'ways to preside in a man's home blest him with its blessing. Now, Sir, if you are not happy in your home, let me advise you to practise my father's recipe. At least, try it, Sir ; one trial can do no harm. If you find it succeed, as I am sure you will, try it again, and you will soon discover that there is not only poetry but fact in the expression tbat you have an angel in the house."], [50, "42 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER VIII THE BOND. Mr. Goader was the attorney employed to draw up the bond by which the money Mr. Levy advanced my father was secured. He was a native of Wednesbury. He commenced bis career in the law at Birmingham, but having no interest there, he took up with the lowest kind of practice. Although time gave station and wealth, the habits he had contracted clung around him ; the character be won never left him. Many were the anecdotes told by the elders of dark deeds, of reckless acts, of broken homes, and ruined fortunes, which marked his road to wealth. He was accused, and no doubt justly, of appropriating to his own use moneys wliich were due to witnesses attending the county Assizes ; of hunting his victims to death with the keen scent of the blood hound ; of grasping the Tyburn Tickets, and selling them with a relish. He worked hard to make a fortune, and he accomplished his object. But he was always a lonely and separate man; the blood-avenger was on his track, and there was no city in which he could take refuge ; no tear was shed when he departed this life; but when the grave closed upon him, all men felt that an evil spirit was gene. Even his fellow lawyers, men not remarkably squeamish about the means they used, often condemned his deeds. Aud what was it to gain that, in the estimation of all men, be turned his back upon a good name, and became infamous ? Yes, what was it to gain? A fortune \u2014 and where is it? His son died of a surfeit ; his daughter went to the grave childless ; his seed is no more on the earth ; and that wealth which tempted his soul to sin is in the hands of a stranger in blood. So let it always be \u2014 there is a Providence now, as of old, that will not let the wicked flourish. When a boy, sitting by my father's fireside,"], [51, "THE BOND. 43 and constantly hearing of the snares he was laying to entrap the innocent, and how, by little and little, he entwined himself around the wealthy \u2014 wheedling, encouraging, flattering with most refined flattery, agreeing with them in every whim, every opinion, and every thought, appearing to make their resentments his resent ments, their likes bis likes, frowning when they frowned, smiling when they smiled, laughing with convulsive merriment when they attempted a joke, and retailing the wit to all ears he thought would take it home again \u2014 I thought him a most consummate man. Many a time have I peeped into his office, with the same feeling one peers into the cave which contains the tiger's lair, to look at the weapons used, and the fascinations which enabled him to make other men's property his own \u2014 according to law, and both judge and jury to defend and protect the robber, and punish the poor man who had been stripped of his worldly goods, because, with feelings only too natural, he had expressed his resentment in unmeasured terms. Oh, when will the time come when they who preside in our courts of justice will not permit its purity to be stained ; when they will look at the motives, and not be so overridden by the forms ; when they will consider unscrupulous means as more than venial sins ; when tbe clever knave shall not be permitted to victimise open and confiding honesty ? When shall it be that the habits of the advocate shall not hang about the judge and permit him to wink at things which have been done by the instrumentality of his court, and upon which all honest men cry shame ? I have said I looked into Mr. Goader's office to see what weapons he used. I saw only pens, and ink, and paper, and parchment, and a few seals. I had read in stories of romance that when the wicked magician desired to enchant his victim he used a wand, and an altar upon which he burned incense ; that he drew cabalistic figures, and muttered incantations to evil spirits, and sold his soul to the Prince of Darkness ; that he played with the higher feelings which bind man to his kind ; that he surrounded beauty with enchantments from which the noblest souls \u2014 the chivalry of our race \u2014 attempted relief in vain, but at last innocence was triumphant, and the wicked was carried away to the regions of punishment. He enjoyed a few days of success, but suffered in return an eternity of torment. In my simplicity I expected to find like things in"], [52, "44 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. his office, and was surprised to see none of them ; but time has taught me that a man may sell his soul to the Wicked One with out romantic forms or incantations ; that he may enjoy the fruits of wickedness for a season, but that, as sure as tbe morrow's sun will rise, so sure will punishment overtake him ; that the old stories of romance, divested of their symbols and their allegories, contain eternal truths, which the wisdom of the past has bequeathed to the present ; and that paper and parchment are as powerful, have all the magic of the enchanter's wand, and can enclose the victim in all the horrors of the demon's cave. The clerk's office, which was also the waiting room, was fur nished with three old-fashioned chairs, having very capacious seats, and one form, upon which five or six persons could sit. The desk at which the clerks sat was divided from the other part of the office by two doors, one on each side, and the tops of the doors were surmounted by short curtains, hung by rings to a curtain rod which opened with the doors. When the doors were shut they and the curtains perfectly screened the clerks and their work from the other part of the office. When my father and Mr. Levy went to sign the bond, the clerks were busily engaged with a bet one had made the other, which was this \u2014 they had each of them cut a piece about an inch long off the top of their quill pens, and had slit each end thereof so as to make four short legs to each. They placed both of them on their legs ; under them they put the point of the penknife, about a quarter way open, and by pressing gently upou tbe blade, it flirted the piece of quill up, and the bet was, which, in the best of three, could flirt them up the highest. This trifling pastime afforded them much amusement and fun. Before them were several copies of writs to be served on the morrow. To my father these were signals of sorrow , and he felt a cold chill pass over him as he witnessed this frivolity. How many homes would be invaded by trouble and grief before the morrow's sun would set ! and there, by the missives which were to carry that trouble, those young men were betting and laughing. It seemed to my father as much out of place as if they had played a game of cards upon the coffin in which bad been just enclosed the corpse for which a family grieved and wept. \" Is Mr. Goader in ? \" said Mr. Levy, at the same time"], [53, "45 THE BOND. opeuing one of the doors, and going inside picked up the copies of writs, and looked them over. \" A good crop,\" said he, as he put them down again. Both clerks grinned at him sniggeringly. \"Mind,\" said he, \"you do not get a broken head when you serve them. I see there is one among them who is very likely to do it.\" \" He dare not,\" said the elder clerk, \" we served him out before.\" \" How was that ? \" said Mr. Levy. \" Why, you see, I had to serve him about this time last year, at the same suit. I had a deal of trouble to get at him ; I got at him by a ruse. I had to go up three pairs of stairs, aud as you looked over the handrail at the top, you could see the stone floor in the hall at the bottom. I represented that I had come to pay him some money, on account of a gentleman in London, as I had done once'before. I met him on the top landing, and served him there. When he found he had been trapped, he went white with rage. He caught hold of me by the neck, lifted me over the handrail, and swore he would drop me, if I did not eat the copy. My cries brought assistance, and I was heaved back again.\" \"Did you fight him?\" said Mr. Levy. \"Fight! No,\" said the clerk ; \" we lawyers know better than that ; we should get nothing but bumps and bruises. No, we stood on our dignity,\" continued he, drawing himself up like a mighty man \" We took proceedings for the insult ; I got a new suit of clothes, and our governor got swingeing costs. He won't do it again ; I should like him, for I want another suit ; \" and all three laughed at the adventure. \" You are a deep dog,\" said Mr. Levy, at the same time poking him in the ribs. \" Do you attend that debating club now?\" \"Yes, yes.\" \"And shine as usual ? \" \"I fancy so.\" \" I wonder you do not aspire to the bar ; I think you would soon take the lead. A man of your abilities would get his deserts there.\" \" I fancy myself that I should not be a muff ; but penury, Sir, penury has kept many a great man down besides me.\" \" Aye,\" said Mr. Levy, \" there is many a genius in rags. Take my name into the governor, and say I am waiting.\" His name was taken in, and the reply was, \" He will see you directly, Sir. He wanted an excuse to get rid of the poor devil who is with him. He has sucked him dry, and it will not be long before he is in limbo ; \" and he seemed to enjoy the misery that used-up client endured."], [54, "46 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. Poor man, he found himself face to face with ruin. He lingered in the office even after all hope was gone, and had to be harshly dismissed by the man who, he thought, could avert the calamity which was about to fall upon himself and family. Fear not, there is a God above who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb ; if that round in the battle of life be lost, bear up manfully, and the victory may yet be won. Fly not to Bacchus, the god of the heathens, for comfort, but to the Christian's God, before whom, in better and happier days, a kind mother taught you to kneel and pray. As my father and Mr. Levy entered the office, Mr. Goader rose, shook hands with Mr. Levy, and nodded to my father ; he then busied himself looking about his table for something he had lost. The table was covered with drafts and instructions, and copies tied round with red tape ; some of them reechy with age. Only a few of them seemed to be recently added, if you were to judge by the freshness of the paper and the cleanness of the tape. Besides, the quantity spread upon the table was more than the most expeditious workman could write in several years ; they seemed to be placed there for ready reference, but in reality for show, to give the visitors an idea of the vast amount of business transacted in that office ; for if there were so much upon that table which he had not so far done with that he could not yet safely put them away, what must there be in those cupboards and those japanned boxes, and that large iron safe up in the corner ! and what a vast amount of business must be transacted in that office ! Behind his seat were book-shelves filled with books of a very ancient and dusty appearance ; indeed, darkness and dustiness were the characteristics of the office. He did not seem to find what he was looking for, so he made an action with his hands which seemed to say, \" .Never mind; I will look for it by-and-by.\" He then searched over the desk and drew out the bond my father was to sign from a bundle of other papers, and asked him to peruse it. He then drew out a drawer from the side of the desk at which he sat, and made an entry in a book, and replaced it. He then took the bond out of my father's hand, and read it over in a rapid but very monotonous tone. \" Please sign it there,\" said he. While my father was signing it he put his hand over his back, and"], [55, "47 THE BOND. received the money from Mr. Levy. He counted it over, paid it to my father, first stopping his costs. My father recounted the money, found it short, and said so. \" They are my costs, my man \" \" But,\" said my father, \"I want the whole money ; and I will pay your costs in one month.\" \"O dear no,\" said Mr. Goader, \" we always have our costs ; \" and he walked awav to the large iron sale and placed the money he had stopped therein. He knew why my father wanted the money. He knew my father gave a large premium, and he knew that my father had asked for no more than he wanted ; and one would have thought that common humanity would have indulged him in the credit he wanted; but Mr. Goader's was an office in which common humanity had been so long absent \u2014 was so entire a stranger \u2014 that her features and her characteristics were totally unknown. \" In this office, Sir,\" said Mr. Goader, \" we make a practice of first paying our costs, and then handing the balance, if any, to our clients.\" Yes, and humanity may look on and grieve \u2014 may shed bitter tears \u2014 may bend the knee in sup plication \u2014 may implore with ardent earnestness \u2014 but the practice was never altered."], [56, "48 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER IX. PAYMENT. Our warehouse had a counter across it, to divide it, so tbat strangers coming in were made to wait there until the business they had come about could be transacted. The part thus divided made a waiting room. At one end of the counter was a flap, which, lifting up and down, made a passage from this part of the warehouse to the other ; tbe flap shut with a spring, which could only be opened from the underside. There was one chair, upon which the person waiting could sit. It was Mr. Mincher's habit whenever he called upon us, to pass this barrier, and walk about the inner part of the warehouse, as if it were his own. We were rather pleased than otherwise with this familiarity, and all of us were cheered a little by his presence. My mother heard his carriage come to the door ; she ran im mediately and shut down the flap, so as to bar him out. Wben he entered the warehouse, he tried to lift it, but as he did not know how it was fastened he was unsuccessful. This little rebuff seemed to disconcert him ; he sat down upon the chair, and you could not tell whether the good spirit or the bad was working within. There was no greeting either friendly or unfriendly. My mother was looking out some orders, mv father was attending to one of the workmen, and I was writing at the desk. I had often heard people say that there was and is, with some persons, a pleasant and cheering presence \u2014 that a halo or atmosphere appears to surround them, under whose influence we experience a quiet delight ; and with others, a cold and chilling sensation, as if you were in the immediate vicinity of an iceberg. I felt the latter sensation as soon as he put his hand upon the latch to open the warehouse door. There might not be any"], [57, "PAYMENT. 49 emanation from bis person to cause this chilliness ; it might arise in myself, from the knowledge I had of his errand, and his ttmper. No matter how philosophy may explain it, I felt it, and I could not, though I tried, master it. My father was occupied w;th one of the workmen ; the workman was going to leave as soon as he saw Mr. Mincher enter, as he had been used to do, bu\". my father detained him, and as I thought and believed, puiposely prolonged his business to annoy Mr. Mincher. He sat down upon the chair. My Mother said, \"John, get the chair, and reach me some rings off the upper shelf.\" I, nothing loth, sprang over the couuter, took the chair from Mr. Mincher, and, by this man\u0153uvre, made him stand. Then I saw the dark spirit rise within him. The spitting propensity and the fidgety look took possession of him. He cast his eye rapidly all round the warehouse, to see, as I thought, if any of the stock had been removed or secreted. I took a delight to take an under look at him \u2014 to watch the working of his angry spirit. His black scowl looked blacker, his thin lips looked thinner, and I thought there was a slight squint in his eyes, as if from suppressed passion, which I had never noticed before. His whole features had an ugly and haggard expression. His pride was offended, his avarice was alarmed, and his dark soul struggled to master his feelintrs. My father bade me ask him what was the balance he considered due to him. He answered '' One hundred and seventy-five pounds.\" My father told me to take off the allowance for cash, and pay him. As soon as he heard this, bis bearing, and the expression of his features suddenly changed from one of ill-concealed rage and disappointment to a craven sycophancy ; and he began, with the most finished finesse of which he was master, to try to worm out the source from which my father had obtained assistance. He hoped my father had not disposed of any of his stock at a large sacrifice on his account. \" O dear, no,\" said he ; \"I am happy to say I have not sold anything to pay you, either at a sacrifice or without a sacrifice.\" \" I should be very sorry,\" said he, \" to have forced you to borrow money at a ruinous interest.\" \" No,\" said my father, with off-hand carelessness. \" Or of allowing a large premium to any customer for a payment before due.\" \" Not at all,\" said my father. He received the money, gave a receipt, and wrapped it up in his"], [58, "50 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. pocket-book. My mother, with true womanly feeling, believing that what was grand and high in her estimation, was grand and high in the estimation of others ; that what excited her envy excited the envy of others ; that what seemed superlatively respectable to her was superlatively respectable to all people ; that those who were loaded with the signs of wealth were wealthy; \u2014 my mother, I say, during the time the account was being settled, had gone and dressed herself with the richest dress and shawl she had got. She wore the new bonnet my father had bought. She walked into the warehouse with the full bloom and dignity of a queen ; her face was flushed with pride, and her silk dress rustled as does the breeze when summer's evening fades into night. I must say that I felt something of her spirit, and was proud that I was the son of such a woman. Her mien and bearing said, more plainly than words, \" You thought we were going to fail, did you ? Look at me ! Can one who has such dresses, and shawls, and bonnets fail ? I am not going to be trampled upon by a man whose wife has not got such gay and costly clothing as I have ! \" Mr. Mincher, with humble humility, I say, with the humblest humility, began to apologise for pressing for payment. He hoped he had not disarranged my father's business. It must not be thought that he doubted our solvency, but he had* been so pressed himself, and had met with so many losses, that he must be excused for being so very peremptory. Anything that he had got was at my father's service, and he might pay for it whenever he liked. Nothing could be in greater contrast than his sycophancy when he had got his account paid, and his severe harshness when he thought that account in danger. It was not contrition nor repentance that wrought this change, but the fear that he had lost a good and safe customer. To touch my mother in the weakest point, and through her to remove the wrong im pression he saw he had made, he offered her the use of his carriage. I was afraid the bribe would succeed, for she dearly loved a ride in a carriage ; but her purity was beyond tempta tion, and she declined it with a lofty and scornful air. She clung closer to my father than usual, as if she thought she would never accept a favour from the man who sought to ruin him. She then walked across the warehouse with a stately pride,"], [59, "PAYMENT 51 displaying her rich attire to the very best advantage. I wa3 young then, and I liked her spirit. \" That is it, mother, encore,\" thought I, \"do it again.\" Mr. Mincher did not like to be defeated, so, to win back the favour he had lost, began to talk about his greenhouse, and how beautifully the flowers were in bloom. He regretted very much that tbe atmosphere of Bir mingham was so smoky, that the innocent and ladylike enjoy. ment ot floriculture could not be carried on in town, and how much pleasure it would give him to send a bouquet of cut flowers, if he might hope to have it accepted. I was afraid this bribe would certainly succeed, for she was a most passionate lover of flowers. She would admire them, arrange them, place them in tbe best part of her parlour, and I never saw any one exhibit so excellent a taste in displaying their relative beauties \u2014 but this bribe failed also. Mr. Mincher then desired to take an order, but my father said that when he wanted anything in his way he would send, and he went away almost as much chagrined when he had got his money as he was angry when he was afraid he had lost it. \" There,\" said my mother, \" he is gone and done with, and I am glad of it. Some people may be trod under foot by any body \u2014 they should have some spirit like me. If he did find me looking out an order, what then. I consider it no disgrace to a tradesman's wife to assist her husband in his business. I knew how to serve him ; a proud, frightened fellow like him. A s soon as he saw my eight-guinea dress and my four-guinea shawl, and my new bonnet, he was humbled directly. I watched his eye, and as soon as he saw me he quailed like a guilty thing as he is. I say if a tradesman wishes to be respected among tradesmen, he should dress his wife in the very top of the fashion. I shall go out and walk up and down New Street before I undress. Mrs; A \u2014 will say to Mr. A \u2014 when she goes home, ' I should think Mr. is getting money very fast, for I met his wife dressed in the most costly style, and she carried her head so proudly as if the street was not good enough to walk upon.' You may depend upon it as being quite true, that the very first sign that a tradesman is saving money is to be found in the gayer and more costly dres3 of his wife. What do people say ? ' I should think Mr. B is getting very poor, for his wife goes about"], [60, "52 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. ragged and slipshod, and looks haggard and careworn.' I f.m not going to act in that way. I hope when I am out that I shall meet Mrs. Mincher, won't I give her a scirnful look, that's all. I am not going to be trampled under foot. She will be as much humbled as Mr. Mincher. Lord bless me, what an altered man he was as soon as he saw me walk into the ware house full dressed.\" My father suggested that it was probably caused bv having unexpectedly received his account ; but my mother would not admit any reason but the one suitable to her view of things. \" Receive his account,\" said sbe, \" no such thing, he thought we were poor ; but I soon convinced him that he was wrong. When we take our walk on Sunday afternoon, I should like to walk by his house. Won't I do it proudly, that's all. I will show you the way to live. Keep up appear ances, and never let your wife be mean and shabby.\" This was my mother's way. She had a theory of life, and however much it may have been modified by the strong common sense of my father, upon that theory she acted. She did so without the least idea of perverseness or that it was at all eccentric. She often told my father that he had but half learned his lesson, and if he wanted to learn the other half, he should take pattern by her. This was the language she always used whenever my father was too much for her in argument. And was my mother a sample of the world, or was she a paragon among women ? Are there not those who believe that their view of things is the only truth, and all others false ? Are there not those who think that it is a sufficient answer to unanswerable arguments, that the propounder has learned but half his lesson ? and is it not the case tbat a well-turned phrase is sufficient to demolish a golden chain of finished logic, or the wisdom of the wise ? There was once a little rill, even a runnel among rills, whose waters every summer's day dried up and only left its pebbly channel, but the rill had as high an opinion of its own power as if it had been the broad river into which it dribbled its waters. One day the clouds heaped up in the sky like a mountain land, looming in Alpine cliffs and beetling head lands, the lightning darted from its bosom, and flashed like the sword of Gideon ; the thunder rolled and re-echoed from cloud to cloud ; the waters came down in one drenching torrent, as if the"], [61, "PAYMENT. 53 deluge had come upon the earth agaiu ; the river overflowed its banks, and the works of man were carried away by the wild flood. God's own bow bestrode the saturating storm ; the birds, which had been hushed into silence by its majesty, burst into joy ful song again ; the waters retired. Then the little rill spoke and said, \" See what mighty things I have done.\" And as the grand march of matter and of mind moves on with mighty motion, controlled only by an Almighty Providence, does not man stand bv like the little rill, and sav, \" See what mighty things I do ? \""], [62, "54 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER X A PANIC. \" Father, there's a run upon the banks. The people are all frightened, and are taking their one pound notes and demanding gold for them.\" \" I am sorry, my son, to hear it. These periodical panics bode good for no one. All taking up the senseless alarm produces the very evil of which they are afraid ; the people press the bankers, and the bankers press the people. It is, save me, and let all the rest perish. It is more like a scramble than the sane conduct of sensible men. Failures will produce failures, and trade will for a time be almost suspended. Many a one, who by wild and foolish conduct is adding to the panic, when its consequences come to press upon the shoulders which must in reality bear the loss, will rail at the law, or other people, or anything, and will not admit they are only feeling the legitimate results of their own folly. Men say that the one pound note is of the value of a sovereign, but their conduct shows they are not believers in the doctrine. They are perfectly conscious that no signs nor ornamentation can make the piece of paper of the value it purports to be ; then, when any trifle, it may be, causes alarm, they run in wild panic to get the pound the paper promises, for fear the till should be emptied before their turn should be served.\" \" But, father, I thought it was the law that the one pound note was worth a pound.\" \" My son, if it were the law it is not the fact, and there is no power that ever existed on this earth which can make the people believe, where money is concerned, th-it a fiction is a fact; they may say they believe it, but put them to the test, and they will run to the bank as wildly as any one \" The premises in which the bank that particularly attracted my attention was held had been a superior private residence. There"], [63, "A PANIC. 55 were palisades surmounting a dwarf wall along the front. A wall had been built across the hall, so that there was no entrance into the house excepting by passing through the room in which the banking business was conducted j at least I never saw any. Yet I suppose there must have been some back way used by the chief clerk and his family, who lived on the premises. I say the bank which particularly attracted my attention, because it was there my father did business, and we had used to call it \" our bank,\" but there was a run upon all the bauks as well as upon tbat. Standing upon the dwarf wall, holding by the palisades, and stretching their necks to look over the blinds, were as many idlers as could find footing. 1 hey at first seemed as eager and as excited as if it were their money in jeopardy rather than that of the senseless crowd who were almost fighting to be first at the counter, until a very fat man came puffing and p-mting along, with beads of sweat standing all over his face as if he had just come from the washing tub. He was so winded by exertion, fat, and fear, that he could only utter one word at a breath, \"are \u2014 they \u2014 broke; \u2014 are \u2014 they \u2014 broke?\" \"Not yet,\" said one of tbe idlers, \" but they soon will be if \\ ou do not make haste.\" Most of the people who stood upon the dwarf wall began chaffing him. The doorway was already thronged and choked by those who wanted to get in, as well as by those who wanted to get out. Tbe new comer seemed as if he alone would fill the doorway. He pressed up the steps, and acted as if he thought every other alarm should give way to his special alarm. His purse might have been as fat as his body ; when in his own home, sitting in his own chair, his wealth may have made him king of the corner ; but there, crushing at that bank door, he was but a man among men, and all his words of command and airs of superiority were subjects of mirth, and not of obedience. Even ladies, to whom the rougher men would give the way on ordinary occasions, were crushed, and hustled, and pushed back. The one great fear that their money would be lost levelled all distinctions \u2014 wealth, station, sex, and weakness, were all un cared for. \" Gold for my notes ; gold for my notes,\" was the panic-stricken cry. If any one more sane than the rest asked, \" What they were frightened at,\" the answer was, \" I am frightened at nothing ; but I want gold for my notes, and will"], [64, "56 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN have it. They promised to pay on demand, and why do they not ? They ought to open the back door, and put on more hands, and not let us be crushing in this way. They should bring the gold out into the streets, and pay us here, if there is not room enough in the bank. What are they doing, paying in sixpences ? \" Such was the reckless alarm of the moneyed classes, that the run upon the bank threatened to end in a riot, when others besides those who had a legitimate claim would bave shared in the treasures of the bank. But it was not only those who had notes who were struck with this panic fear. 'I hose also who had balances at call, desired, and did cheque out all that belonged to them. They appeared to believe that the money they had deposited there was locked up in a strong safe and that the pleasure derived from being the custodians of so much wealth was a sufficient return for the interest they gave. \" Gold, give me my gold,\" was the panic cry of one and all. It is said that when the volcano poured forth the flood of liquid fire, which overwhelmed the cities of old, some of the inhabitants were arrested in their flight by the molten flood and buried therein, while in the act of running. Their household gods were aban doned to their fate, but the gold was firmly clutched and held with a death gripe. Life was risked and life was lost to save their gold. So at this bank door they crowded and crushed, and screamed and fought. Yet, above the din was heard the panic cry, \" Give us our gold ! \" The old, the lame, the decrepid, contended with vigorous youth for priority. 'I he fashionable lady, in her dainty dress, contended vigorously with the greasy mechanic. The palsied old man lifted his withered limbs and crushed with a power as if his pristine strength had returned. One and all, high and low, gentle and simple, learned and un learned, contended with each other in wild panic for gold. The crowd watched the clock, and as it neared upon four, the hubbub, the crush and the cry became wilder. All politeness and respect was tossed on one side. The strong stooped a little, and forced their way to the front with their elbows. Talk of a mob urged on by want to riot and destroy, it is nothing to a wealthy mob urged on by the fear that their wealth will be lost. Women pushed, cried, hustled, and screamed ; men fought, and struggled, and swore ; and, as the clock struck four, the principals in the"], [65, "57 A PANIC. bank introduced the police from a back room in which they had been concealed, to clear the offices and close the doors. Then the cry of shame was loud and fierce, the door was kicked and thumped. Men jumped up and down to look in at the windows and grin defiance \u2014 threats, wild threats, were uttered. Men and women, gentle and simple, stood about in groups discussing the law of the case, on whom the loss would fall if the bank should be broken \u2014 upon the actual holder of the notes or upon those from whom the holder had received them. And many a prin ciple was then laid down as law wbich would receive no sanction in any court of justice. It was late at night before the crowd dwindhd down to a small group, still intent upon the law, as if the law was sufficiently omnipotent to produce the gold, when gold there was none. I knew those bankers were men of honour, and would do their best to ride out the storm, but the utterance of that opinion merely called upon my head the execration of the mob. The next day the same scenes were enacted, and on the following, which was Saturday, at the close of that day I heard one of the bankers say, as he lifted his hat and wiped the beaded perspiration from the top of his bald head, \" Tbank God, to morrow is Sunday.\" This was the scene among the mob. What was it among the bankers ? At first tbe notes were paid as of course, and excited no surprise. As they became gradually aware that the people were in panic they ran to each other for help, but as the run was not upon one, but upon all the banks, no assistance could be derived from each other. Then the panic seized the bankers as well as the people. Staid men of the world as they were, they became alarmed. They flitted in and out of the bank, looking as un concerned as men in fright can, thrown upon their wit's ends to mett their calls, hoping against hope that the panic might abate; at night holding close and anxious counsel with each other. On Friday night, a deputation started by the night coach for London, to implore the Government for assistance. They could meet with only one Minister, and with him they went to the Bank of England, that depository of all the wealth of the world, where they shovel up the sovereigns as we shovel up gravel, for assist ance. But the Bank had so many calls upon them, that all its boasted power was paralysed. They could not assist to the"], [66, "58 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. extent they were wanted, for throughout the length and breadth of the land the money panic had spread. Deputation upon deputation arrived, urged by the one fear \u2014 the panic. There was a panic among tbe people \u2014 a run upon the banks every where. Gold for our notes was no longer a local, but a national cry. In twenty-four hours all would be bankrupt, and every thing in barter. The Bank directors, summoned hastily together, were overwhelmed with the greatness of the calamity, and, with all their boasted wisdom, stood at bay. If it were to be bankruptcy, they could only bold up their hands at the folly which caused the general ruin. At length it was asked, \" What have become of the \u00a3 1 Bank of England notes which have been withdrawn from circulation ? \" The question was hailed as the saviour of the hour. Search was made, and they were found bundled up in parcels of hundreds each, ready to be destroyed, but not yet done. That one neglect saved the fortunes of millions. It was proposed to advance those, notes to the bankers, with as much gold as could be spared, and with them to stem and stay the panic ; tbe Minister taking upon himself the responsibility of this illegal act. Deputations posted east, west, north, and south, with the assistance thus afforded, with some doubt, but with more hope, that it would be successful. It was on a Sunday they went flying through the country, leaving behind at every post town rumours of the marvellous amount of money they were conveying home ; and, as they all were under a joyous excitement, as men relieved from sudden fear, their manner added to the fabulous stories the imagination of the people created. As the baste, post haste news of victory won by the army over national enemies is carried by breathless messengers from man to man, from house to house, from town to town, from village to village, and along in secluded places where none but the most momentous intelligence ever reaches, so, at the firesides of the people on that Sunday evening, were marvellous stories told of the endless wealth which had come down from London to check the wild panic for gold. As men retired from their weekly devotions, their minds were fided with the stories of gold. The old told the young many a memory of former runs for gold, which had spread rain over the land, when our armies were fighting the battles of Europe ;"], [67, "A PANIC. 59 how the Bank of England itself was obliged to suspend cash payments, or the country would have been ruined ; how a law was passed that a \u00a3 1 note and a shilling were equal to a guinea, but yet guineas sold for twenty-seven shillings each ; how the time was there was not such a thirst for gold \u2014 old England was happy and merry then, with simple wants, simple desires, and simple thoughts \u2014 when there was no hurry to be rich \u2014 when homespun garments, simple fare, and country stories, made all men happy. I have sometimes heard young men treat the olden times with contempt, and huff at the stories of happy innocence which prevailed. I have made allowance for their youth and in experience ; have looked upon them with pity ; have thrown back my imagination into the days of old, when labour was cheered by song ; when the peasant was happy, and never wished to leave his native valleys, where his forefathers had lived and loved, and laid their old bones in the old churchyard amid the hdls and vales which had so often re-echoed to their songs and the wild laughter of their unchecked merriment ; and I would not thank the learned for the knowledge which taught that the happy scenes I saw were but fond fancies."], [68, "60 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XI. PANIC. 'When the banks opened ou Monday morning-, as great a display was made as possible of the treasures which had been obtained from London. The gold was strewn over the counter in heaps, and the notes were piled one upon another in square stacks. As the people entered they were astonished at the piles of monev, apparently inexhaustible, which were lest after a three C3vs' run. It was bruited abroad that the Bank of England had come to the rescue, and was prepared to assist them in fabulous amounts. The panic was arrested, aud that silent consideration which always precedes a change in the conduct of men, fell upou the people. The prophets broke it first. Those who are for ever exclaiming aster the event, \" I told you so ! You would not be ruled by me. What need was there for you to be alarmed ? I knew as well as could be it was all right. Nothing of this sort would have happened if you had not been so .frightened.\" \" Then why did you run the bank as well as others ? \" \" When I found the people would not be persuaded I rau because they did.\" This answer is a sufficient explanation for many of the follies of the multitude. It is done because ethers do it. Men act in crowds, and th* sane and the sensible look on with regret at conduct they know it is all in vain to attempt to control. There is no class, no station, and no condition exempt. Kings act as kings act ; it one by stratagem or force extends the bounds of his dominions, another tries on the same game. If one, having respect to nothing but what he thinks conduces to his own dignity, enlarges his prerogatives, another trenches upon the liberties of the people, and rules them as if they were his property, making the word \"subject,\" which"], [69, "PANIC 61 ought to be no more than a term of flattery to a king \u2014 for man is a man, no matter by what nickname he may be called \u2014 a sufficient reason why he should oppress. If one reviews the force which is to do his behests, another calls forth his armies in battle at ray and plays defiance, though his words are the words of peace. If one in his pride, looking at the mighty mass of men extending before him far over the distant plain, even to where tbe heavens kiss the earth, flatters himself those heavens are supported upon the glittering spears of his host, another gathers his men in serried batallions, and as they move before him in mimic battle believes the earth quakes under their tread, as if struck with sudden fear. If one calls upon philosophy and science to lay their treasures at his feet, that his armies may be invincible, the other neglects no weapon the cunning of man can invent, and all his thoughts and his engines are of destruction and death. So it is with Ue people. At one time it is \" Hosanna ! blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord ; \" at another it is \" away with him \" and they prefer a robber instead. It is impulse and not judgment which rules. The capital of a bank consists of two kinds, one is that which the several partners have placed there, the other is the deposits received from their customers and the general public, and the way in which they get profits is by using the money \u2014 either by the way of discounts or advances to their customers. When trade is healthy this can safely be done, having in the till such an amount \u2014 depending upon the business they do \u2014 as experience tells them is sufficient. But when a panic oomes the deposits are suddenly drawn out, and as the advances to customers are not always immediately available, the banker, in self-defence, has to withdraw accommodation and peremptorily demand re-payment of advances, and at all risks and at all hazards to gather up his treasures. Ihe run was over, and without allowing breathing time the sequel followed. \" Messrs. Pekaj, Leek, and Co. inform Mr. D. E-, that the balance owing by him is \u00a3. \u2014 8. \u2014 d.

Dekay, Leek, and Co., \" Fbf.j>eric_\u00a3 Faithful.\" The public had distressed the bank, and now came the bank's turn to distress the public. One would have supposed that a com munity of suffering would have made them considerate ; but the fear that all men would be pressed to pay all they owed made them determined to be first while there was comparatively plenty in the cash box. If they went when there was a famine how could they expect a supply. \" John,\" said my father, \" take this advice note to the bank ; and if you can make up the amount without taking in any of their notes do so, for I would not have them suppose that we have done anything to increase the difficulties they must have to contend with.\" I went to the bank with the advice note and the money, and found it deserted ; the piles of money were still upon the counter, and everything was arranged so as to give an idea of boundless wealth. The olerks were busy among the books \u2014 so busy that I could scarcely be attended to. They were all eager and deep in tbe mysteries of double entry. My business was done, and not a word was said. The clerk who attended to me quickly returned to his books, at the same time chewing a biscuit, as if he had so much to do that he had not time to eat a regular meal. W hen I passed by the bank late at night they were still at work and eagerly busy. I stood upon the dwarf wall as I had seen the people do, and looked over the blind to see who were working so late. They were all intent upon their work. There was the chief clerk, with his thick neck, his pouting under-lip, his bald head, and his chubby face ; his head, neck, and face all of a pinky-white, without any variety in the shade of pinky-white, but as clean and as bright as if it had been just washed and polished. There was Mr. Faithful, who had been clerk there all his life, but he was thin and spare, his body was not round, but flat, as if he were in the habit of sleeping between two boards and had become as flat as a whiskey"], [71, "63 PANIC bottle ; his dress was a black coat and waistcoat, black smalls, white stockings, aud black gaiters; his calves may once have occupied that part of his legs enclosed in the white stockings, but it was before my time, if ever ; he wore a white neckcloth all round his neck, and tied behind ; his hair and whiskers were of a silver white, and in plenty for an old man, and brushed and combed so well that there was not a single hair out of place ; he bent at the knees, leant forward, and had a mincingly quick walk ; he carried a cane with a silver mount and tassel ; always put on his gloves as he came out of the bank ; he was never known to go anywhere but to the bank and home, which he did twice a day during the week, and to church twice every Sunday ; his shoes had steel buckles almost as large as your hand, and on Sunday silver buckles about the same size; but they were never known to have a spot of rust, or tarnish, or dirt upon them. Whenever he passed a person he knew he did not bow, but slowly turned his chin on one side and looked proudly solemn. I for a long time thought him no more than an animated machine, doing the work required of him, then resting until he was required to work agaiu. A little dainty, clean, and methodical body, with not enough soul to teel as human beings feel, not having had any of the vicissitudes of life to show of what stuff he was made \u2014 contented with his duty, contented with his salary \u2014 contented with himself, and at enmity with no one ; while the run was on the bank he was all bustle, anxiety, and surprise \u2014 bustle to get the extra work thrown upon his hands done by the usual time, and with the usual neatness \u2014 anxiety for fear anything should go wrong \u2014 and surprise that the solvency of \" our bank \" was doubted ; but after observing him for some years I unexpectedly found that his heart was as kind as a woman's, and that adown that seemingly soulless face tears could roll in copious streams ; that whenever he could say a kindly word for a struggling and deserving man he said it. He never spoke in censure of any man excepting to the man himself, and then it was so quietly and kindly done that there were but few upon whom it did not work a change. Sitting opposite to Mr. Faithful was \" Soapy Sam,\" as my mother called him. She looked with dislike upon the over oily aud smooth man \u2014 therefore had sbe given him this sobriquet. He was extraordinarily civil. He always put his hand out over"], [72, "64 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. the counter when a customer entered, to shake hands, and with a smile and a strong aspirate said, \" Ha! how do? Glad to see you this morning. Fine day. How are your family ? Good news, I hear \u2014 large orders have arrived in your way. No doubt you will have your share How do you want this? Oh, I see; ha ! to go to account. The drawer of this cheque is very rich \u2014 very rich indeed \u2014 been buying property almost daily. This bill is \u2014 ha, \u2014 is \u2014 ha\u2014 Oh, I see; I could not make out the writing at first. It is difficult, you see. A little more pains with the signature would be better.

You were here yesterday. Have the other side made up. Next time \u2014 ha, next time. Good morning. Ha, ha, ha, ha, \u2014 good morning.\" So he would go on to all customers, smiling and making a noise like a laugh all the time. He had a springing and quick step, aud got over much ground in a short time. Always saw any one he knew a long way off. Met them with a giggling laugh, and a wave of the hand ; not bowing at the same time, but rather scraping with his feet. I was struck with what I thought a strange fancy of his. The front teeth were large and well made. I thought nature had been very kind to him in that respect ; and be was very fond of showing tbe bounty with which she bad blest him. Now, the strange fancy was this : several of those teeth bad wire wrapt round them, close up to the gums. I have many a time speculated what that could be for. I used to think he was fond of singing, and that this gave a metallic ring to his voice, which he thought improved it ; for be was just the man for a party, being full of the small change of society. He was what some call a lady's man, but my mother called him \" a gentlemanly mollycot,\" and she always spoke contemptuously of all sorts of mollycots. Poor man ! he has been dead some years. I have"], [73, "65 PANIC since known that those teeth were not his own, but had been the teeth of some former inhabitant of this earth, whose bones were then rotting in the grave. As I looked through the window there was opposite a half glass door, I could see into the room from where I stood. Mv lather used to call it the sweating room, and has often said that many a tradesman had been cured of a cold by a little conversation there ; it was like a hot bath to all who entered, but as I looked in I saw no one but the principals ; they were anxiously engaged looking over a large number of circulars, which were being compared with a list which lay before them. The sweating a tradesman might have had there could not have been much greater than theirs, for each of them frequently applied a handkerchief to mop up the perspiration which stood in beaus upon the head and neck. \" Ah,\" said my father when I told him this, \" there will be many an aching heart to-morrow. They are circulars to tradesmen to pay the balances they owe. Some will swear and fume, others will groan and grieve ; some will become fidgety and snarling, others will let them do their worst ; but the right way is to consider it an incident in business, and meet it Uke a man.\" That is a chapter in life most difficult to learn. c"], [74, "66 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XII. TOUTING. Have you in wandering along the green lanes, or across the daisy-bespangled meadows, observed how faithfully the wild flowers, the merry birds, and the dancing insects reflect the influences of the hour. If the day be bright the flowers expand their petals and woo the kisses of the passing breeze, the groves re-echo to merry songs, and the insects people the sunbeams with a mazy dance, the branchlets expand their forked arms with firm vigour, and the leaves seem happy in the sunshine. When all is bright, nature is gay, and there seems to be a soul full of intelli gence in the lowest forms of organised life ; the edge-rows are covered with bloom, tbe banks are bespangled with beauty, and the meadows have scattered over them nature's gems in prodigal profusion ; all seem in life and animated with joy. But if the day be overcast with gloom all nature is sad; the birds are silent, and if the merriest indulge in a song there is melancholy in his music ; the flowers close their petals and keep their beauty for sunnier hours ; the insects seek repose in some sheltered nook ; the trees stand chilly and the leaves half sold themselves ; the daisy retires into its calyx as into a cloak ; lambs do not chase each other in play, nor do young foals gallop over the meads ; the gloom of the sky suffuses itself over everything which has life, and melancholy broods over all ; the work which nature designed them to do may proceed, they may live, but they do not live with joy. Has nature spoken to you ? Have you heard her voice? Have the brawling brooks been to you monitors? Have you heard a song as it were of sadness when night creeps upon the day, and silence and solitude are the spirits of the hour ? Or are you so made that these things seem to you but"], [75, "luU'll.Nd. 67 as the disordered visions of a morbid mind ? If you can intone your mind to the music of nature, can be happy when she is gay, or mournsol when she sings as it were a song of sorrow, you have communed with her, and know that there is a soul which animates all organised beings, and that that soul is sad when there is gloom, and merry when all is bright. When the excitement of the panic was over, a gloom, similar to that which falls upou all things, most depressing and most sad, fell upon tbe people. Man in his pride believes that all his actions are the results of logical deductions, that it is intellect which guides and directs him ; but the mandates of instinct are more frequently obeyed than those of sound reason. At this time an apprehension of coming trouble filled each heart with fear, and as tbe morning postman delivered the peremptory messages from the different banking firms, rumour threw suspicion upon the credit of tradesmen with greater freedom than she had upon that of the bankers. If one had a sad and perplexed expression of countenance it was evidence of a perplexed condition of affairs ; extra bustle was thought a sign of extra difficulty ; tradesmen watched the doings of tradesmen, and suspected every one. The mere suspicion brought about the evils it imagined. But there was a class of men whose steps were light and jaunty, expecting gain when others expected loss \u2014 the lawyers were glad in the expectation of a rich harvest, and smelt the prey and prepared for the carnage. These men are idle when trade flourishes, but when difficulties press, and bankruptcy makes havoc of msiny a fortune, they are in the ascendant \u2014 the storm birds who make most prey when the tempest drives rich argosies against a rocky coast, and sometimes the wreckers who lure the vessel to destruction that they may become fat on the cargo. Mr. Goader was walking up New Street, looking in the distance as if he expected to meet somebody and was anxious to see them as soon as they hove in sight. When he was opposite the Post Office, he stood looking up the street. At this time tbe office was near to Bennett's Hill. It was a rough-cast building; had a small porch inside a door, over which a lamp hung, and inside of which porch there was a window at which to make enquiries, and a box into which letters were deposited. It was in its infancy then, aud before the street called Bennett's Hill"], [76, "68 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. was made. Mr. Goader stood by the door still looking up the street in expectation of seeing some one. Mr. Faithful turned the corner of Christ Church from Congreve or Friday Street into New Street. As soon as he did so Mr. Goader took a bundle of letters out of his pocket, theu turning himself round with his face towards the theatre, began examining the directions upon the letters. Just as Mr. Faithful came abreast of him, he turned to put them into the box, thus making the interview he bad sought appear an accidental meeting. \" Good morning, Mr. Faithful,\" said he, \" a fine morning after the busy time you have had. By the way, did you ever get the blood-money whieh arose out of that forgery case of Leathers ? \" \"I did not,\" was the reply. \" Well, if you will look into my office I will pay it to you.\" Now it was his desire and plan to get him into his office, therefore did he propose to pay him the blood-money arising from this long delayed and almost forgotten case. He had re ceived it, and should have paid it long ago ; but as Mr. Faithful had made no application for it, he had mixed it with his own cash, and would not then have proposed to pay it, bub that he had an object of his own to serve, to accomplish which he thought the forty pounds blood-money would do. He knew how powerful money was with him, and how omnipotent it was in his practice. He had seen men whom the world called humane and honourable have no qualms of conscience where it came from, nor how it was obtained, so that they got it. Therefore he had no suspicion that any one would be \" so foolish,\" as he called it, to reject it, because it arose from an impure source. \" Thank you,\" said Mr. Faithful, \" when I want it I will call for it.\" \" No time like the present,\" was the answer. \" Mr. Goader, if I were to take that money it would haunt me day and night. I should think that the poor man's ghost would meet me in every lonely place ; would visit me at every midnight hour ; would dog my footsteps wherever I went ; and when I came to lie down for the last time in this life, would wait until my soul took her flight to anolher world, and give evidence against me at that awful tribunal before which you and I, Mr. Goader, are destined to appear to give an account of the deeds done in the body. No, Mr. Goader, such money I cannot touch.\" \" Ha ! ha ! ha ! why, Mr. Faithful, are you a sentimental man"], [77, "69 TOUTING. of that sort ! I took you for a man of the world ; one who bad seen so much of its ways that you had become practical, and was not overawed by likes or dislikes. Leave,\" continued he, at the same time touching Mr. Faithful on the shoulder, \" leave such sentiments as those to the parsons and the silly girls ; it is the business of one to teach such things, and tne profession of the others to believe it. You and I, you know. are men of the world. Call in and I will pay you the money.\" He shook hands, and was about to leave ; he returned, and said, by way of afterthought, \" Your house has fallen upon troublous times, and I shall be happy to assist in any way ; please offer my services.\" \" It does not matter, I suppose,\" said Mr. Faithful, \" whether it is the action or tbe defence to the action.\" '* Ha ! ha ! ha ! you are disposed to be a little severe upon me,\" said he ; \" but remember, Sir, I am a man of honour, with an income of thirteen hundred a year. Had I been only a man of honour your sarcasm might have been just ; but you say true \u2014 but you say true \u2014 it does not matter ; and am I therefore different to the rest of the world ? Does not the draper sell wedding gear as well as mourning weeds \u2014 the jeweller the jewels which sparkle in the ball room, as well as the jet ornaments which signify passing sorrow? Do our gunmakers care though they know that the weapons of destruction they make fill our hospitals with the maimed and dying, our country with widows and orphans, and a pit with the uncoffined and uushrouded dead ? Do not you, Sir, hand money over tbe counter which will be spent in vice, as well as that which will be spent in virtue ? If you and I were to stand contemplating the consequences of what we do, I fear we should do but little. Let the soldier's maxim be ours,\" continued he, at the same time shaking his hand, \" do your duty and slaughter the enemy ; they would do the same by you if they had the chance.\" They parted. Mr. Faithful had not had the same experience of the world as Mr. Goader had, nor did he wish to bave it ; therefore such doctrines sounded very harshly to him. He felt that he would not exchange his keen sensibilities, bis love of virtue and hatred of vice, for all the wealth which had passed through his hands during the time he had been at the bank. He thus soliloquised : \" He said he was a man of honour, with an income of thirteen hundred per"], [78, "70 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. annum, and his wealth is the cause that many things which he does pass without challenge, which, if done by a poor man, he would be the first to prosecute, imprison, or transport. If with that income he be guilty of such things as are charged against him, how can we wonder that the poor man is sometimes driven by poverty and want into crime? Tbe poor man who passes through life with his integrity unstained, deserves the highest honour. If thirteen hundred a year will not keep a man from crime, ought we to expect poverty to do it ? \" Opposite the bank was a pastry-cook's shop, which., in military language, \" commanded the entrance \" to the bank. Mr. Goader went there and bought a biscuit. He sat down to eat it, at the same time watching who went into the bank, and drawing inferences from the expression of countenance as to whether his services might be required. He had not been long there before Mr. Mincher's carriage came to the bank door. The coachman was directed to drive down New Street. \\\\ hen Mr. Mincher was gone into the bank, Mr Goader came to the shop door, still chewing his biscuit, to watch which way the carriage would turn, -binding that it went up High Street, he inferred that it was going home, and that Mr. Mincher would walk from the bank to his warehouse. He therefore walked up New Street and along Friday Mreet, turning back when he was nearly at the warehouse, intending to meet him as he came from the bank. In this intention he was successful. He met Mr. Mincher with a frank and hearty greeting. \" I am glad,\" said he, \" your bank has got over the run upon them so easily. I hope they will not be too pressing with their customers, for trade will take some time to recover from this violent disturbance. T am happy to say that I have been very successful with my clients in arranging their little difficulties. I had one, now, whose credit is undoubted, and whose property is very great indeed \u2014 his credit quite as good as yours, Mr. Mincher. He was pressed for a matter of a few thousands, in consequence of a slight irregularity on the part of his stupid cashier. You know we are all the victims of our servants, and our fortunes are too much in their hands ; but, as I was saying, he was pressed for a slight matter of a few thousands. He was a foolish fellow to be alarmed at such a mere bagatelle. I put him"], [79, "71 TOUTING. right directly. I do not know that anything ever gave me more pleasure. It was a great indignity to have any suspicion thrown upon him, but you know the best characters are not exempt, and men of large fortunes have at some time or other some difficulty. I hear they are very pressing.\" As this was a sounding expression, he turned and looked firmly in his face. He knew enough of Mr. Miucher's temper to see its effect, for he began spitting, as was his wont, and was very fidgety. He had said enough for his purpose, and it was not his habit of saying any more when he saw that the effect he desired was produced. The twig had been properly limed, and all in good time the bird would be caught."], [80, "72 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XIII. OLD JOE. The next post following that which brought the bankers' circulars brought a circular from the merchants and factors requesting that all orders on hand might be omitted until further directions. So that the violent disturbance in the money market produced the first of its natural results \u2014 a stoppage of trade ; workmen were discharged in shoals. A child when it falls or stumbles, beats the obstacle wbich was the apparent cause of stumbling : so, and with about as much sense, did the workmen blame the employers of labour that they did not still find them full employment. \" Why do they not let us work for stock ? \" said they ; \" there is plenty of room in the warehouse. They have been getting money out of us long enough ; they ought to spend some of that money to keep us at work. It is us that suffer; as soon as bad times come we are discharged, and left to live anyhow, or else to starve. They will give us advice, but no means to get a living. Are not we the bees who bring all the honey to the hive ? and it is a poor thing that we cannot have some of that honey, when the winter comes. We say they ought to be made to support us, if they do not think proper to find us work. See how we slave for them, and see how we are served.\" Many a tradesman, whose heart was full of kindness, was blamed aud abused, when, if the whole truth had been known, he would have been pitied with a sorrowing pity. To them, day after day brought trouble ; and night \u2014 the lonely hours of night \u2014 refused that balm which slumber gives the weary. The heart \u2014 the poor heart \u2014 ached almost to breaking. Their hopes destroyed, their prospects ruined, their wives struck down from the station in which they had hoped to"], [81, "OLD JOE. 73 place them, and their chddren, for whose welfare it was a happiness to live and a pleasure to toil \u2014 their children \u2014 but I will not dwell upon grief ; it is depressing enough when it comes. My father, like the rest, had to discharge some of his workmen, and to put the others on short time. I must here make a confession of one of the errors I committed at that time. Then I thought I acted rightly, but now I see I did wrong, and unnecessarily gave a fellow man pain. If he were alive I would ask his forgiveness ; but he has been dead long ago. Poor old Joe ! I feel that I embittered the last years of his life, and beclouded the evening of his days. He was faithful to his duty. I ought not to have expected from an old man the active labour of a young man ; I ought not to have expected a tool which, by reason of its old age, had lost all its steel, to cut as well as a new one. Poor old man ! I am sorry tbat I ever made him grieve. Old Joe, as we used to call him, had been a servant of my grandfather. From a boy he had had but one situation ; he was apprenticed to my grandfather, he worked for my father, and did not leave the service until death called him to a better and a happier place. Altogether he was sixty years and three months with us. In his younger days he was the best workman in the trade, and he took a pride in his work. No man was so ready to labour ; no man was so proud of his labour ; no man could sing so merrily at his labour ; no man could so readily make new patterns as he \u2014 patterns, too, which always commanded a good sale. In consequence of his skill, he had a good opinion of himself, and was a little, but a very little conceited ; he was an authority in the trade, and both my grandfather and my father deferred to his judgment. But age gradually stole upon his skill, and that cunning of hand which had been his characteristic insensibly failed. As it did so, he became a boaster, but only such a one as a kindly old man usually is, boasting with so much innocence of the agility of his younger days, and laughing at the tricks he used to play then. I never knew an old man yet but, according to his own description of himself, was always too much for his compeers ; how he could jump, how he could run, how be won at all athletic sports, and what a smart man he was when dressed up in his Sunday clothes,"], [82, "74 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. with his hair powdered and his pigtail tied round with black galloon. Many a time, when I was a boy, has my grandfather told me of his victories and his deeds, and I thought there never was such a grandfather as mine. When I got older I thought he slightly exaggerated his good qualities, and I would say, \" Grandfather, there is no one but you who knows what a clever man you were then ; you know and you can tell me anything.\" \" Ask your grandmother,\" he would say ; \" she knows it is all true. Do you not my dear ? \" But she would say, \" I know you say so, love, and I never contradict you. \" I have many a time teased him until my grandmother got out of humour with me, and would say that \" all he said was true, and that I was a young scapegrace for trying to tease the poor old man.\" I must confess it was very wicked of me, and that I now am receiving a righteous punishment, for my grandchildren tease me in the same way I teased my grandfather. To return to old Joe. He had gradually fallen from a piece-worker to a day man, and from being the best workman on the ground to being a jobbing man, doing anything there was for him to do ; indeed, his fellow workmen would sometimes call him \" Old Strike-a-light.\" But Joe had some respect for himself, even when weakness and old age grew upon him. Now, more as a matter of charity he was kept at full employment, when the other men were put upon short time. As there was not much for him to do, I said, \"Joe, I will have these windows cleaned.\" \" Very well, master,\" said he. My fault was this, he had some dignity left. Though the old dog had lost his teeth, he thought it beneath him to hunt anything. \" Joe,\" said T again, '\u25a0 I will have these windows cleaned.\" \" Very well, master,\" said he. \" Then why do you not clean them.\" \" Me, master ! me clean windows ! my head would turn giddy, and I should fall, and perhaps kill myself.\" \" I tell you what, Joe, it has come to this, you are getting an idle lazy fellow ; we keep you about the place, and pay you your wages when there is nothing at all for you to do. You have been here too long, Joe, and think you can do as you like, but I will let you know. If those windows are not cleaned directly, and without any grumbling, you get yourself another place.\" \" Me ? \" said he. \"Yes, you.\" \"I am old, master, now ; you do not mean me ? \" \" Old or young, I mean you, '"], [83, "75 OLD JOE. said I, \" and I will have them done.\" \" Me leave this place, master ! a service that I have been in all my life ; what should I do ?\" \" That is your look out, and not mine.\" \" I am old, master ; I have served you, your father, and your grand father. You do not mean that I should leave you in my old age, and seek a new service ! \" \" But I do, though.\" \" Then I shall not,\" said he firmly. \" I was here before you were born, and I am not going to leave for such a young upstart as you are. Me going to leave ! No. If anybody is to leave it must be you, master. You have not been alive half the time I have been in this service, and I shall not leave. Leave, why where should I go to, an old man like me ? Leave this place, that I have been in man and boy for more than fifty-six years. No, I will not. I have speut my best years in the service, and I will not. No, I will never leave until I am carried from here to the grave. I am an old man, and poor. It seems the few years I have to spend in this world are to be spent in misery. I wish I had been dead before any one had told me I must leave. Oh, my poor heart, my poor heart, be still! Master, is it because times are bad you want to pick a quarrel with me ? tell me. Do you feel that my poor wages are pressing upon you, and that it is necessary to save even them ? If so, tell me, and I will leave you till better times come again.\" \" No, Joe, no ; I am master here, and I will be obeyed. Now, it is come to this, you clean those windows, or leave.\" \" Then I shall not, since it is come to that ; I am as proud as you are and as stomachful as you are. I shall not clean the windows, and I will not leave for such a young upstart as you. There now.\" The poor old man began to cry like a child. I must confess I felt moved by his grief. But then, you see I was young, and thought myself somebody. It was a contest between my dignity and old Joe's pride. He was our servant, and I thought the obedience which the employed owed to the employer made it imperative that my dignity should win. It was wrong of me, I must confess, but I have seen many a proud heart compelled to bend with the humility of a slave before an inferior in intellect, and every way an inferior as a man, because fortune had placed the lesser man in a station to command. Yes, I have seen the proud soul bend and break and bow his head to a yoke imposed by a mean hand."], [84, "76 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. Old Joe was not going to leave without an \" appeal to Cresar.\" He went down into the parlour and told his story. Our scivant Mary came up for me. Both I aud Old Joe were favourites with her. She seemed ready to cry. She said, \"Master John, let him stop, and I will clean the windows. Poor old man, bis heart is almost broken.\" But my pride, you see, my dignity, my position as a master had been insulted. My honour was attacked, and what will not man do to prevent even a stain upon such spiritual ghost-like immaterial things? Fight unto the death. Stand by a rag of a flag until every man is struck down ; endure imprisonment for an age in a loathsome dungeon. It is tbe stuff of which heroes and martyrs arc made ; the father of all those good deeds which shine with so much glory, and should therefore be defended with a manlike fortitude. When I got into the parlour there was my mother \u2014 good woman as she wns \u2014 placing a basin of warm soup before old Joe. She was of opinion that the right and proper way to remove grief and sorrow from the hearts of the poor was to feed them well with soup, or gruel, or cordials. She said they had such \"comforting influences when poor souls were breakingdown.\" As soon as I entered she looked at me as she stood on the other side of old Joe, and said, \" John, how could you do it ? Poor old man, he shall stop here until he dies.\" As she said so he fairly blubbered with a laughing hysterical grief. My mother put l\\pr arm round him, and com forted him as if he was a child. She stirred tbe soup with the spoon, and said, \" Do not take on so, eat it ; it will do you good, and warm you. Cheer up, cheer up ! he did not mean what he said, did you, John ?\" I did not speak, but I twisted myself about, and with a dignified frown thought tbat \" I did though.\" \" Joe,\" said my father, \" when you have eaten that soup, I want you to take a message for me to Handsworth. And John,\" said he turning to me, \" I expect your orders to be obeyed as if they were mine ; but on this occasion leave old Joe to me, and take this account in to Mr. Levy's.\" I did so ; and on my return found that my mother and Mary had cleaned tbe windows. It was a trifle about which to quarrel, as I have many a time since thought ; but are they not trifles all about which men of honour contend and quarrel. I have seen the war-horse, proud of his rider, and of the"], [85, "77 OLD JOE. gaudy trappings by which he was adorned, toss his bead to display his proud plume, and caper and caracole iu the cavalcade, enjoying the pomp and glory of war, champing the bit which in foam restrained him, eager to join in the mad charge of the horse and his rider, as if the trumpet of fame roused him to glory more than it did the hero he carried, the martial music moving him as a being endowed with the highest intelligence, the very personifica tion of courage, pride, pomp, and glory ; and I have seen him hanging his head in tbe weakness of age, yoked to the meanest use to which so noble a being can be applied, a thing of humility and ill-usage \u2014 the slave of the veriest slave ; and I have thought of poor old Joe."], [86, "78 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XIV. A SWEATING. I have said that I took an advice note to our bankers, and that they received the money and made no reply; judge then what was my father's surprise when he received their circular declining to advise as requested. \" John,\" said he, \" did they ssy anything to you when you took that advice note to the bank.\" \"Not a word, father.\" \"Not a single word ? recollect your self,\" said my father, with surprise and indignation. \" Surely they have not become dishonest as well as alarmed. Not advise the bill when the money was sent them for the express purpose of doing it. Receive the money, and not perform the duty for which they received the money ! it is not merely dishonest, but dishonourable. The high feeling of honour which some people profess with so much dignity to be their guide, seems to be such only because it has endured no trials. There is a meanness at the bottom of these proud characters which always comes upper most when they think it can be of service to them. The high souled honour which would scorn to do a wrong thing seems as timid as a bird, and flies away at the least alarm when money or even its apparition throws a sickly and death-like glare across the scene. JNot say a word ! Well, I will go and see them. I suppose they think that in times like these, when an universal suspicion keeps watch over all tradesmen, tbat they cau do just as they list, and as all credit is shaken, those they treat thus will keep as dark, as close, as silent as sin, that let the wrong be ever so great, it dare not be resented. It is not native honour which restrains such men but cowardice, the fear of public opinion. They are only brave enough to commit sin when they feel assured the sinned against dare not speak.\" My father said this"], [87, "79 A SWEATING. with an iudignant and passionate emphasis which I had not before heard him use ; he was usually very considerate, seeing both sides of a question and ready to find arguments in favour of any line of conduct which others had taken, willing to excuse aud be forbearing, but on this occasion, he was overcome with a sense of injustice. He went to the bank and was ushered into the sweating room. Mr. Dekay was there, and he received him with a cold politeness. \" Take a chair,\" said he to my father. \" I have called for an explanation to the note I have received from you.\" \" Allow me to look at it,\" was the stiff reply, with an inexpressive official look \u2014 a look which is intended for solemn wisdom until the note has been read which is the cause of the interview. \" Well, Sir, the note explains itself, we have put the money to account. You must meet your bill in some other way.\" \"But that bill will be dishonoured.\" \" We regret that.\" \" What am I to understand by this conduct,\" said my father. \" What it says : you must pay the balance and shift the account.\" \" Pay the balance and shift the account !\" said my father ; \" pay the balance and shift the account ; what does that mean ?\" \" I regret,\" said Mr. Dekay, \" that you affect not to under stand me. Mv time is precious, and I must wish you good morning.\" \" But,\" said my father, \" I cannot be dismissed in this way ; I must know in what way I have drawn upon myself this visitation.\" Mr. Dekay stood with the door in his hand, bowing with the same cold politeness as before for my father to go. Whenever my father had been to the bank he had been received in the most generous and urbane manner ; but now there was a studied coldness and distant civility ; before there was a reception as inviting as the shopkeeper gives to his customer, but now a dismissal as severe as tbe shopkeeper gives the assistant who has robbed him, but whom he declines to punish. \" Before I go,\" said my father, \" let me ask, do I owe you any thing ?\" At this question Mr. Dekay left the door, and crossed to the other side the room, opposite to where my father sat ; as my father had been invited to sit when he entered, he kept his sitting during the interview. The banker consulted a list which lay upon the table, then called for Mr. Butter. Soapy Sam answered the call. His manner was usually over polite. On this occasion he did not look at my father. He was in that"], [88, "80 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. state when one knows that there is something he ought to see, but at the same time does not want to see. He therefore, looking at nothing, took three long strides across the room, dipped his nose down to the sheet Mr. Dekay had been consulting, and pointed out the sum opposite my father's name ; he then held up his chin, and kept scratching it with his forefinger. Before an answer could be given, Mr. Faithful entered, bringing with him a large ledger. He gave my father the usual turn of his chin, and said, \" Good morning.\" He laid the ledger before Mr. Dekay. There was this wide difference between Mr. Faithful and Soapy Sam : the one had a cold and formal exterior, an almost repulsiveness in his manner, but he always improved under diffi- culties. He was short, correct, and decisive in his judgment ; saw the truth instantly, and as it were by instinct. Under no circumstances did he lose the meagre amount of what is called a polite manner he possessed ; on the contrary, when he met with a person under difficulties, it mellowed and improved, and a quick ear could detect, after a little practice, an increased tone of kind- ness in the sound of his words. Soapy Sam was all polite- ness, yea, the very pink of politeness, but when difficulties pressed he seemed to distrust his own judgment. Not knowing what to do he did nothing and saw nothing, and if persons he knew ever fell from the pedestal upon which his imagination had placed them, they fell for ever with him into utter oblivion. He bowed like a sycophant before success, but turned his back upon failure and forgot it for ever. Mr. Dekay and Mr. Faithful looked over the ledger and held a conversation with each other in whispers. They then called Soapy Sam's attention to tbe account. They all three then examined the ledger, Soapy Sam being in the middle, turning from one account to another ; then leaving the room for another part of the bank, brought in another book and and a file of cheques. The account was compared with the book thus brought, and the cheques were ticked off in a straightforward, business-like manner, until they came to one at which all three paused and passed from hand to hand ; they cast up the account in pencil. Mr. Faithful and Mr. Dekay held a further conversa tion in whispers, and Soapy Sam left the sweating room for the bank ; but he did not look at my father as he passed. Mr. Faithful turned to my father and said, \" This circular should"], [89, "A SWEATING. 81 not have been sent to you at all. A cheque was sent in by one of our customers, during the run, for the sum of one hundred pounds. He is of the same surname as vou, and it has become wrongly posted, making the account appear against you. When you receive the returned bill refer them to us, and it will be all right. We have no other apology to make for this except the hurry and flurry of the last few davs.\" \" I must confess,\" said Mr. Dekay, \" that I felt a little resentment at the thought that you should have sent in a cheque, during the panic, which overdrew your account. It was a mistake, and I am sorry for it. You are at liberty to over- draw your account to a moderate amount. Instructions will be given for your cheques to be honoured. Of course we have, in consequence of our superior means of information, a greater knowledge of affairs than you have ; and let me advise you to be very cautious for the next three months at least. If you can afford to be idle, you will find it much cheaper to you than by risking your property in tbe hands of persons who iu that time may be nowhere.\" Mr. Faithful left the sweating room, and Mr. Dekay, to remove the impression this mistake had made, told my father some of the particulars of the panic, and the secret history of the assistance the bankers had obtained. He was more civil and more obliging than he had ever been. Instead of dismissing my father with a stiff unbending body, and the door shut to with a slam (the mere conventional way of doing such things), he was dis- missed with great cordiality. As he left, Soapy Sam, all smiles and politeness, held out his hand to shake my father's. \" A mistake, you see ; a slight mistake. Great hurry, great bustle ; we cannot help them sometimes. Very sorry, very sorry indeed. All right, you know ; all right. Hope your wife is well, aud your son \u2014 a fine young man ; steady, quick, thoughtful ; a credit to you. You should be proud of him ; full of business qualities \u2014 if the thing is to be done, he will do it. Good morning, good morning \u2014 he, he, he ! \u2014 good morning.\" As my father came out of the bank, he saw Mr. Goader standing at the door of the Plume of Feathers, as if waiting for some one. My father came up New Street, full of thought. Though calmed by the explanation given, the feeling of indigna tion the affair bad caused was not entirely removed. There was therefore a dark and thoughtful expression upon his features,"], [90, "82 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. which might be readily misunderstood. He had not gone far before Mr. Goader overtook him, and looked him up and down with a scrutinising glance. He walked on faster than my fi'ther ; when he was about thirty yards before him he paused, as if recollecting something he had forgotten ; then returned, and again took a searching look at my father, who felt as if a spirit were passing, having all the fascinating power of the basilisk. As the little bird instinctively trembles when the hawk stoops to its quarry, so did my father feel a dread, a shiver pass through him while under the searching look of Mr. Goader. As the seaman sees far away in the offing the looming signs of the coming storm, which will toss his vessel upon the wild waters as if it were a thing of naught against which it scowled and roared iu anger, so did my father feel as if trouble were coming upon him \u2014 a sentiment of great trouble, wliich almost paralysed him with dismay. If nature has given to some of her favourites a keen sensibility, a quick discernment, and a prophet's prescience, she has also mingled with their strong passions and wisdom, smiles and tears, and submitted them to the influences of every passing cloud. But she never neglects her children : if she gives them the power to feel sorrow as deep as Rachael's, she also gives them the gladness and the joy of the archangels. There is not a breath that breathes but to them is a silent comfort ; there is not a flower that blooms but to them is a child of beauty ; there is not a drop of dew wliich blesses the summer's morn, or sparkles in the rising sunlight with all the colours of the dove's neck, mingled with the fiery flash of the sapphire, but to them is an overwhelming joy. To them day after day brings its lesson ; and the night, with its many lights hung in the deep blue sky, is a volume whose first page was written in the eternity of the past, and whose last shall be written at that awful day when all these things sball be folded as a robe, aud time shall be no more. If there be not music in the spheres, as of old was fabled, to them there is a song of glory more bewitching than much music. God spoke to his favourites of old in audible language, and communed with them as man communes with man ; but now, in that silence in which he works all his wonders, the sterility of winter is changed to the beauty of spring, and there is not a sound heard except by those whose ears are attuned to celestial harmonies. The spring"], [91, "A SWEATING. 83 mellows into summer, the summer ripens into all the bounty and profusion of autumn, and all goes on in silence. The birds may carol forth their song of joy, but nature does her work in silence, even in still silence ; and so does God now speak to man. But I must reserve such thoughts for a nobler theme. It is always difficult to meet wrong inferences from admitted facts, but it is more difficult to meet those cautious insinuations, which pass from mouth to mouth, when half is told, and the rest hinted ; when also the person who is their object is not aware of their existence. The bold and open adversary may be met, respected, and answered ; but the sly, sneaking knave, who cautiously inocu lates with his venom the generous minds who do not suspect the craft, because thev have no craft themselves, deserves and ought to obtain universal execration. Insinuations may be necessary for some people to get their bread, but how much better it would be if they would follow an honest calling. My father felt that the next trouble which would fall upon him would be caused by in sinuations, and he was the more grieved because he knew he should be charged with things of which he was guiltless, and he felt that he should not be able to stand up in fair fight, for he would have to contend with the consequences of those charges, and not the charges themselves. His knowledge of human nature told him that friends would fall away, perhaps be his bitterest enemies, and that the battle of life would have to be fought alone. It was so ; but he stood up bravely and endured to the end."], [92, "84 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XV. THE EAGLE AND HALL. There was. at the time at which our history has arrived, a celebrated hostelry named the Eagle and Bail. It was known as a house in which the leading spirits in Birmingham met to discuss the affairs of the town and of the nation ; and sometimes with high ambitious thoughts they took the affairs of the world under their patronage, and settled them with the profoundest wisdom. Many an argument has been held there with the most searching logic, and with the firm belief that if those magnates had been the world's magnates, events would have been guided to better issues. Many a one has retired from those discussions when the Old Church was striking tbe sraa'l hours of the night, self-satisfied with the part he had taken in the debates, and with the firm con viction that if he had been placed upon better vantage ground he could have made himself a niche in the history of his country. The company at the Eagle aud Ball had admired, cheered, aud applauded his sentiments and his eloquence ; but could he have had the world for an audience, he should have had the world's' plaudits. Ah me, it is a pity we cannot all be great ! And after all, is not the applause of a man's friends, those with whom he daily associates, sweeter, and better, and more sincere than those of the multitude, who set up Dagon to-day, and break him to pieces and trample on him to-morrow. For my own part I would rather receive the praises and live in the memory of my bosom friend than those of an united world. I was once happy in those of my bosom dear ; but, alas ! there I have been bereaved ; and when in the fairy hours of night, visions of the past come to bless me with the wonted applause, I weep to think they are but like the story on the wall, a record of times which cannot return."], [93, "THE EAGLE AND BALL. 85 Properly to understand the course of this narrative, it will be necessary to fix the attention chiefly upon one of the usual visitors to the Eagle and Ball. Let me say in passing, and I consider it my duty to do so, that by the gentlemen meeting there, many of the improvements in my native town were broached, and that they have not failed to leave their mark upon the times iu which they lived. 1 was, as I believe, unknown to them. If they were anything to me, they were foemen ; but, foemen or friends, they deserve to be remembered when the deeds that have been done in this town are recorded. When one passes by the temple of which one's country is proud, we join in the general admiration, but think not of the mind which conceived it, and by whose direction it was reared. We enter into the inheritance our fathers have left, and take no thought of the toil and the sorrow by which it was won. It should be otherwise. If it were not for the soldier, the general could win no honours ; in every victory the humble combatant should be remembered. Let honour be given to whom honour is due. Upon the graves of many who met there might be written the noblest epitaph, \" They deserved well of their native town.\" The person upon whom our attention has now to be fixed was a short fat man, shuffling about in slippers, clothed even in winter in thin summer clothing, his waistcoat open, and his neck unbound by a necktie. He was always hot, naturally hot. When he entered the parlour he blew, as heaving a deep and long sigh. Almost suffocated by the closeness of the room, he would go to the window and open it. Even in the coldest of weather he would sit in draughts which would give any other man his mittimus to the grave. He thought the chilly winter refreshing coolness, and the genial warmth of spring insufferable heat. His hair was prematurely gray, and the company often joked him by saying that he was an older man than his father. He had married the daughter of a marine store dealer, whose only child she was, and with her he had enough money, as he used to say, \" to find him in grub, and beer, and 'bacca ; two trips a year, one to Lunnun and one to the sea ; and three goes at the play, one on our wedding night, one on my birthday, and one ou hers ; and if a man cannot be happy with that sort of thing, I say he ought to be miserble all his days, and go grumbling to the grave.\" He was a button holder. He"], [94, "86 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. hail the habit of giving emphasis to his language by moving the forefinger of his right hand from himself to his hearer, and when he thought he bad made a point in his discourse, he would tap him on tbe chest with the back of his hand, leaning a little as he did so, then throwing himself backwards, at the same time screwing up his left eye, as much as to say, \" I flatter myself that is not bad.\" When he had to address the company in a formal speech he was slow and deliberate, and by his manner said, \" No one is wiser than I am.\" If any ventured to express a different opinion than his, he would take up a spill and light it, and say, \" Well, that is your opinion, and tbe other is mine.\" He would then light his pipe, looking at the bond at the same time. Having taken two or three strong puffs, he would raise his head and look at the company, from man to man, with an expression which said, \" And I will leave it to the company whether your opinion is good for anything.\" His time was bis own, and he had a great contempt for those who went home early. He thought them poor sneaks, and afraid of their wives. \" If my wife,\" he would say, \" grumbled at me because I went home at twelve o'clock, the next night I should go home at one, and if that did not do, tbe next I should go home at two, and if that did not do, why, the next time I should go home with the milk, and I should keep going home with the milk until she was satis fied. I should never quarrel ; I should only go in with the milk. That would do it,\" he would say, waving his finger and screwing up his eye. \" That would do it ; persevere and be patient, and it would cure any woman.\" Having nothing to do, and being desirous of keeping up his reputation at the Eagle and Ball for wisdom and early information, there could nothing happen but he was always enquiring into the particulars. if a fire took place he went to see it, and enquired what was the amount of damage, where it was insured, whether the proprietor \" could stand it; or was it to be a regular smasher?\" It was his delight to watch the \" bums,\" to see into whose house they went. He revelled in the knowledge of the bad debts people made. He would wink, and whisper, and chuckle at scandal. When it was necessary to seem wise he would frown and screw up his eye and toss his head. Many a man has had the reputation of wisdom for years with no other capital. Once open tbe mouth and the"], [95, "87 THE EAGLE AND BALL. reputation is gone. He would listen to any and everybody to gain information, and having built up what he thought a consis tent story, he would save it until the company was fully assembled at the Eagle and Ball He used to say \"a man ought to take his sleep after dinner, and reserve his nights for enjoyment with his friend, and a pipe, and a song, and a social glass. It was in the power of every man to make his life happy, and he was a fool if he did not. What was the use of going grieving and growling and grumbling about troubles ; shake them off as I do. What the better are you after you have fretted your internals to fiddle-strings? Keep your tails curled ! \" \" Keep your tails curled ; what does that mean ?\" \" Why, do you not know what keeping your tails curled means ; then I will tell you. You remember that countryman of Mr. Levy's that was to have the speckled and spotted among the goats, and the brown among the sheep, and the dodge by which they were got. A sharp fellow was that ; his blood runs through all the Jews ; and be tween you and me,\" he would say in a sort of stage whisper, at the same time screwing up his eye, \"they do not try to work it out ; his example animates them to the present day. But you want to know about keeping your tails curled. 'I here was a farmer once had two sons, but they were not like Mr. Levy's countrymen, Esau and Jacob. His sow had a farry of pigs, eleven at a litter. So he says, says he, ' Wrhen those pigs are ready to leave the sow, you shall have them between you for pocket money.' So the time came ; they were ready. ' Now,' says he to the two lads, \u25a0 the oldest shall have the first choice, and I shall divide them into the curly-tailed pigs, and the straight-tailed pigs.' You see the old chap had just fed them, and had put a handful or two of flour in the wash. They had well-filled their bellies, and were lying beside the old sow, all snug, warm and comfortable. ' Now,' said he to the oldest, 'go and look at them, and tell me which you will have.' He came back and said he would have the curly tailed ones. ' Very well,' says he, ' go aud get the stye doors open, one on each side, and I will bring the whip and drive them in for you.' They got all ready ; he took the whip and he put it among them very freely. There was noise enough in the pig market, I can assure you; but there was not a curly-taded pig among them ; they were all as straight as my finger. You see, when they had got"], [96, "88 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. their bellies full, and lay snug, and warm, and comfortable, they all had a curly tail, but when the whip was among them every one of their tails was straight. Now, that is what I say ; keep your tails curled ; be snug, and warm, and comfortable, and do not let anybody get the whip-hand of you. That is tbe way to live ; keep your tails curled.\" He had by nature a great deal of quiet humour ; so quiet that you would for some time be uucertain what to make of him ; whether what he said arose from a strange and perverted view of things, or whether it was intended for the purpose of giving pungency to his language. Whenever he chose he could give an epigrammatic turn to his thoughts, which added materially to their force and precision, though they might be un couth and rugged. Mo man was so fond of what he called \"selling a pennyworth.\" He was quick in finding a customer and \"giving him the article that would do.\" Like all men of his class, he did not intend to introduce trouble into a man's mind or house hold from any malicious disposition, or any perversity of temper ; he merely wanted the fun and enjoyment another's perplexity gave him. Perhaps he of Malmesbury would say his pleasure was truly selfish, and arose from the evident superiority he had over his victim in these encounters. But there was no deep reasoning of the kind with him ; he wanted fun, and he was determined to have fun. It might bave been his love of fun which made him fat ; or his fat might have been the cause that he was so fond of lun ; but no matter, he allowed no opportunity to pass without improvement. He was humorous ; not comic. There was no ill-nature with him. Frequently, when he saw he had \" carried it on too far,\" as he would say, he did his best to remove the consequences, which were altogether unexpected, and would redeem his fault with much kindness of heart. Of course the panic afforded him an oppor tunity he could not allow to pass unimproved. He was walking about from one bank to another, picking up little scenes and anecdotes, which he intended to use in the evening at the Eagle and Ball, interchanging opinions with all he knew, and collating the information he obtained from different authorities with each other, and eliminating what in his judgment was the truth. He waited about Grubbins' bank, the only one which had to bend to the storm, until the principals went home, and formed one of a"], [97, "THE EAGLE AND BALL. 89 little mob which followed them. \" How many notes have you got ?\" said he to one of the disappointed holders of the notes. \" Ten of them ; and I have been hoarding them up to pay my rent.\" \" Let us look,\" said he. \" Well how prettily it is engraved ; how nicely they have flourished, and ciphered, and curled ' I promise,' making it all with one stroke, twists and curls and flourishes and all. I have no doubt they prided them selves upon the skill with which it was done. When the banker was writing his name at the bottom of that note, I have no doubt he felt comfortable. I should do so, I know, if I could get a pound for every time I put my name to a bit of paper like that. You seeit is all numbered 21,605, and entered '21,605. If they be gan No. 1, why here, you see, they have got at least 21,605 pounds; and I will be bound that is not the highest number out. A very fine thing, to make all that money. The paper and printing did not cost them a ten-pound note. I think I shall set up banker ; I shall be a rich man in no time.\" \" What will you do when there comes a run on your bank ?\" \" What will I do ? why, break, the same as they do. That's the way to do it. Make money to-day, break to-morrow, and be a rich man the next. Now let me give you a bit of advice. When you want to hoard up notes again, let them be those which say, ' I promise to pay Mr. Marshall or bearer ;' that is safe ; because, you see, the banker does not get the money then, it is Mr. Marshall who is the rich man, aud he keeps it locked up all safe ; and you may depend upon this, that no matter how good-natured the banker is, he will not promise to pay him too much ; and that is a safe check that all will be right.\" \" I do not believe in such a man as Mr. Marshall,\" said one of the bystanders ; \" it is all a juggle. Who is Mr. Marshall, I should like to know, that they should always be promising him money ? He must be some man whom they want to have all the money when they break. None of your Mr. Marshalls for me; I can see through it; Mr. Marshall means their iron chest.\" \" No, no ; his name is Gammon,\" said the man of fat, screwing up his left eye, at the same time putting the forefinger of his right hand to one side of his nose, \" Hookey Gammon.\""], [98, "90 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XVI. THE EAGLE AND BALL. In the evening our fat friend was one of the first to arrive at the Eagle and Ball, and as usual he was very hot. The first thing done bv him was to put down the window to ventilate the room. \" It surprises me,\" he said, \" why people like to stive themselves up so ; they get themselves so u^ed to live in an oven that they canuot exist without. Learn to clothe yourselves light, as I do ; then vou can stand all weathers ; and not be cradling yourselves up in corners, and roasting yourselves over the fire as if you were but half baked.\" \" Why, you are so fat, Mr. Blunt \u2014 hot and fat ; and you make no allowance for us thin people, who have neither your contentment nor fat. To give us the same chance as you, we thin people should have half-a-dozen flannel shirts on. Your fat does for you what flannel has to do for us.\" \" I am none so fat,\" said Mr. Blunt, or Billy Blunt, as he was more familiarly called, at the same time putting both hands upon his ribs, and drawing himself up for inspection ; \" I am only jolly. Now, let me give you a bit of advice. Take things as they are ; be con tented ; leave off fretting ; things will be as things are ; fretting will not alter them ; it will only make you as thin as a herring ; be contented. Here, youngster, light me a spill \u2014 do something for cheese, if you have your bread for nothing.\" The youngster thus addressed, lighted the spill ; at the same time drew a pipe case, inlaid with pearl, from his pocket, inside of which was a meerschaum pipe, with a handsome mouth-piece. \" Allow me to look at that,\" said Mr. Blunt. The youngster handed it over to him with great alacrity, and stood by his side during the examination ; indeed he appeared to want his opinion upon its merits. If he praised it, it rose in his estimation, and became"], [99, "THE EAGLE AND BALL 91 a greater treasure. It was his own choice, therefore praise was a tribute to his judgment. If he found fault with it, or merely praised it with a faint praise, he would shut it up and go to the tobacconist for another. ALr. Blunt examined the outside of the case with great deliberation, turning it over and over, and flirting his thumb nail to try whatever he thought a defect. He then tried to open it, but was at fault. The youngster said, \" Allow me,\" and touched the secret and opened it with the greatest ease. 1 his trifle seemed a pleasure to the younster, and he looked round the room to receive the approving glances of the company. The inside of the case was fined with a very soft crimson silk plush. The pipe, which had not been used, lay there as carefully protected as if it had been a gem of the first water. After a close and deliberate examination, Mr. Blunt said, looking up at the youngster as he did so, \"three guineas I suppose ?\" \" No,\" said the youngster, highly pleased. \" More ?\" \" No.\" \" Then you have got a bargain,\" said Mr. Blunt. \" If you colour it well it will be a gem and a treasure. It will colour half way up almost a rosewood, and without a spot.\" \" Will you colour it for me ?\" \" You get it covered as high as you want it coloured with a jacket of wash leather, lined with scarlet cloth, and bring me a pound and a half of tobacco, and I will do it for you ; but mind, you must colour your nose yourself; it will take you a keg and a half of brandy, and when it is once coloured you must never let the fire go out.\" This he said with quaint humour, and with his left eye screwed up more than once. The youngster kept admiring bis pipe. The little examination raised it wonderfully in his estimation. It had already got a good anecdote associated with it, which he would not fail to tell his friends. I have seen a gentleman with a \" gem of a picture,\" which he had picked up in a broker's shop for a few shillings ; had it cleaned ; and, to his inexpressible delight, discovered that what he suspected was true \u2014 that it was a very rare work of au old master. \" Pray, Sir, what are its merits ?\" \" I perceive you know but little of the fine arts. I picked it up in a broker's shop. It is a gem, Sir.\" Another has a piece of red hematite, \" which, Sir, you perceive is amorphous. I picked it up in the Jura mountains.\" \" Pray, Sir, what are its geological conditions? Has it any pal\u00e6ontological adherents, or is it purely mineralogical ?"], [100, "92 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. What do you suppose its place to be?\" \" Sir, it is amorphous, and I picked it up in the Jura mountains.\" One has a book in fine old binding, which he bought at a book stall for a few shillings. \" I saw its merits as soon as I opened it.\" \" Pray, Sir, what does it discourse upon ?\" \" It is a Baskerville, Sir, in good condition, and I bought it at a book stall.\" Thus it is, whether it be a pipe or a picture, a stone or a book, its value is found in its reflex properties, rather than in its own merits. When a little story is associated with any rarity, it adds wonder fully to its value. When the owner is praising it it is like praising himself, and is exquisitely delightful. \" I am happy, Sir, in having such a treasure. Will you take a glass of wine ?\" \" Any news, Mr. Blunt ?\" \" Yes ; I am told that although Grubbins' Bank only failed yesterday, there are people who will give ten shillings each for their notes.\" \" I will,\" said Grocer Mewis ; \" whoever comes to my shop to buy grocery, I will take their notes in payment at ten shillings each.\" \" Will you give twelve shillings and sixpence ?\" \" I will give ten shillings.\" The company became thoughtful and silent, looking from Mr. Mewis to Mr. Blunt, as if waiting for further intelligence. \" Ah, you are a knowing cove,\" said Mr. Blunt, as he rose to light his pipe. Having lighted it \u2014 \" Guaranteed, I suppose ?\" \u2014 he put the question, and sat down. \" I will give that money for them,\" said Mr. Mewis, evading the question as to the guarantee, \" That Grubbins,\" said another of the company, a metal dealer, \" is a sharp, shrewd, long-headed fellow \u2014 he is lucky in his undertakings. I mean to stick close to him and follow him in everything ; he shall have no luck but I will have a share of it.\" \" You mind,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" if he sees you watching him, he will perhaps give you a false lead, and then where shall you be? \" \" Trust me for that.\" \" Such things have been, you know, and may be again.\" \" What a pity,\" said Mr. Lowell, a brass founder, \" that this panic has come just now. I had an order to estimate for this morning, which would have kept me going for the next three months. I calculated the price of every article as close as I possibly could, leaving myself nothing. I merely wanted to keep my men going. But I lost it. Somebody cut in under me. All I can say is I wish it may do them good.\" \" So did I,\" said another in the same trade. \" Was it for Scotch"], [101, "93 THE EAGLE AND BALL. goods ?\" \" Yes.\" \" Is it fair to ask was it for Maccrush and Co.\" \" It was, and I was told that I was 25 per cent, too high. But I know this, that I might have had my money again, and that is all. Whoever has got it I wish them joy.\" \" Do you think there was any order,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" or was it a factor's dodge to get the lowest possible price at which goods could be made in times like these. You know there is many a fool of a fellow who will take work because it is work, and the more he gets for his money the more he likes it. The factor may have thought that he would send round to all in the trade and find one out, fix his prices now in the presence of bad times, and when times get better make him stick to them. Now, there are ' spoil-trades' in every trade. If every tradesman would set his face against them, the thing would be cured ; but you do not. A man comes to you, and for any reason, no matter what, offers you an article much cheaper than you can buy anywhere else. You know, upon the very face of things, he is a spoil-trade. What do you care, you buy of him. When he fails, as you know he must, you say ' I do not care ; I did very well by him, as long as it lasted.' If he be not iu your trade you encourage him ; but if he be in your trade you have no wishes and no language too severe for him. You desire him to be in misery in this world, and to be frizzled up like a broiled herring in the next. If every tradesman would do the best he could to discourage a spoil-trade, the thing might be done. There was old Sam Lea \u2014 what did he do? He went from one trade to another, spoiled every one of them, at last spoiled himself. When he died he left such a tangled web that his affairs had to go into Chancery to be unravelled. And there they are ; his creditors may as well balance up the account, and write ' settled,' for they will get nothing. He began life with a carriage and pair, aud ended it on shanks's ponies. He went in at the big end of the horn of plenty, and came out at the little end. Do not encourage a spoil-trade and then there may be some hopes.\" \" Ah, Mr. Levy, how do you do, how does your wife do, and how do you do other people ? Piping times come for you ; goods at your own price, and as many as you like.\" \" Ab, Mr. Blunt, you are facetious. I have not my money in the bank, I have it in safe places. I see your banks tvould have trouble. I draw my"], [102, "94 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. money out in time. Ha ! ha ! I keep my money. You trades men will want my money ; thus bring their goods to me. I want interest for my money. \" Your goods may lie by me several years ; may want cleaning, may want polishing. You will not do that for nothing. You will make me pay. If goods come to hand and away again to my customer, I will give more. But lie in my warehouse one, three, five years ; money all idle ; interest come to much ; price must be much when sold, or little when bought. I do not want your goods ; you want my money. I do not come for your goods; you must have my money. You pay for it, that is all. If you do not like my price, why you come to my shop for ? Keep your goods, and do not bring them to me. I do not come to you, you come to me ; if you do not like my price, you stop away.\" \"'Ihat is a harsh doctrine, Mr. Levy,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" without one drop of the milk of human kindness to smooth it. There is no more humanity there than there is in the heart of a hawk. It is catch him, eat him up, and nothing else.\" \" Humanity ! Mr. Billy Blunt,\" said Mr. Levy, with apparent bewilderment, \" what is that? Do you wrap it up in paper, or do you pack it in a box? Is it a little bit of something displayed with a deal of tinsel, more valuable for the wrapper than for itself? What is it, Mr. Billy? I do not deal in it, do you ?\" \" Humanity,\" said Mr. Blunt, roused by the occasion and the company to an eloquent turn of thought, \" humanity, Sir, is not to be wrapped up in paper nor folded in tinsel. There is a counterfeit humanity, which is decorated with much tinsel. It is paraded before tbe world with many flourishes, and its great desire and intention is to be seen of men. It takes so many shapes that we do not always know it from the virtue it counterfeits. It will speak in a gentle tone like it, it will shed tears like it, it will seem merciful like it, and show as if it were charitable like it ; it will engage in works for the public good like it ; but, in whatever it undertakes there is gain to itself, and that is its only incentive to action. But there is a genuine humanity of a retiring and modest disposition, which claims no admiration, and desires no fame It has its pleasure in deeds and not in the sound of trumpets ; it helps poverty and keeps the secrets of both ; it moves by the sick man's bed with a light and gentle tread ; it looks upon sin with a tear, and advocates"], [103, "THE EAGLE AND RALL. 95 its return to virtue in tones trembling with emotion ; it taketh the lost one by the hand with much tenderness, and recalls the gentle love of the mother for her child. It is like an angel in the mansions of men, and is one of those traits of heaven and happy innocence which our first parents did not lose when they were banished from the blessed abodes of Paradise.\" \"Very well, Mr. Blunt, that is all very pretty, I dare say, but my nation has never heard of it ; and if it had I do not think we should give it any entertainment. We have left off hospitality to angels, they are not of our nation \" \" Some of the people,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" will require a little humanity in these times, I am sure, whether you know anything about it or not. There is the jeweller over yonder, I saw him come out of the bank to-day with looks black enough for ruin.\" \" What jeweller do you mean ? \" \" What jeweller oo I mean, why him over yonder.\" \" Mine God, you do not mean that ? \" \" But I do though, and if he owes you anything get goods from him as fast as you can, or get your money. You would not like to lose it, would you, even though it might save him, his wife, and son from ruin \" \" Buin, ruin, Mr. Blunt ! it is not come to that surely?\" \" Well, and if it had, you would not press a struggling man unduly, would you now ? \" \"I want to press nobody, I want to ruin nobody, I want my money.\" \" Why, money is your God, Mr. Levy.\" \" W ell, and what if it be my God \u2014 does it not bring me meat ? does it not bring me clothes, and shelter, and comfort, and enjoyment, and friends, and respect ? What if I had not money, could I get meat ? No. What if I had not money, could I be clothed ? No, I must go naked. What if I had not money, could I live in your house ? No. Could I have wine ? No. Could I have friends ? No. Could I have respect ? No. I should be a dog \u2014 a Jewish dog, for every Christian child to spit upon and mock. I have meat, I have clothes, I have shelter, I have comfort, I have enjoyment, I bave friends, I have respect. My money brings me that. Shall I turn my back on my money ? No. You say money is my God. Can your God do any more for you than mine does for me? Shall I turn my back on my God ? No, Mr. Blunt, no.

Let whoever will suffer in these times he will gain.\""], [105, "DEVIL AND ANGEL. 97 CHAPTER XVII. DEVIL AND ANGEL. Have you noticed how differently the inhabitants of a town and those of the country commence their daily labour ? Those of the town come tired from tbeir slumber, and begin the day as if during the first few hours they were not quite awake. Stretching out the arms and gaping, rather soured in temper, ready to quarrel upon trifles, and showing a heavy and half sleepy appear ance. Whde those of the country take their team afield, whistling a country tune or singing a country song, or calling to each other across the headlands or adown the foredraught, or standing upon the bank parting the nut bushes with each hand, and shouting jocund as the morn to their companions who are far afield at their toil. They go singing to their labour about villagers' loves and couutry joys, warbling forth their souls in simple music and unpolished verse, refreshed by sleep, and dull and heavy only when their day's work is done. Such is the course of nature. Wherefore did the poets of old, taught by her teachings, represent the morn as young nymphs coming laughing up the horizon with a dance and a song, all blushes and joy. It may be that these Arcadian scenes were more in their imaginations than in the vales which roused them to rapture ; that the purity aud the beauty which the painter limned and the poet sang were more the refine ments of Attic art than representations of reality. Still tbe country has a joy and a rapture which tbe town cannot give. The clown may be clownish ; but the dells and the dingles, the glens and the glades, the hills and the vales, bedecked with nature's garniture, are everlastingly beautiful. It wa3 with a heavy and sleepy gait that Mr. Goader's clerks entered the office. The woman, whose duly it was to dust and clean it, peeped in at the door with the broom in her haud, and D"], [106, "98 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. then retired for the day. They stood with their backs at the desks brushing their hats or adjusting their coats as they hung against the wall ; then leaning upon their elbows, with their faces in their hands, gaping with a long-drawn sigh, and a \" Oh, dear, oh ! I wish the hours of night were longer, that we might have more for enjoyment and sleep.\" \" 1 went to our free and easy last night ; the poet was there, and he expressed that thought in verse. Lord, how we did encore it ! We had it over three times, and all of us begged copies. He was so proud of the applause. We had him up to make a speech, and he told us all about it. You know his way \u2014 a poor, shy thing, always re quiring to be spoken to first ; a heavy, timid fellow. But we roused him last night, and he was full of flashes of wit and of merri ment ; his eyes sparkled like two bright diamonds ; his face told the thought his mind conceived, even before his tongue uttered it. The poet, under excitement, is something to look at ; but without it he is a dull, heavy fellow.\" \" Ah, I know \u2014 I have seen him before ; but I think you free and easy folks spoil him. Applause intoxicates him as much as wine does others, and will wear him out as fast Unless he alters he will receive the applause of his club only, when, by working in his study, and doing what we know he can, he might leave something behind we should all be proud of. He seems afraid of those dull, cynical fellows, who can do nothing themselves but find fault, and are always trying to pull better people down to their own level. Let him serve a few copies of writs as we have done ; then his fine sensibilities will leave him for more practical feelings, and he will care for nobody. But how did he express that thought ?\" \"'You should have heard him sing it ; such fire and such energy. These things are never so good in the morning as they are at night. We want to hunger for them, and then we enjoy them. But this was that part of his song which expressed his thought : \u2014 ' 0 when the great Architect formed this earth. And planets created to roll through the sky, And beauty and order primeval in birth, Shone steady below and twinkled on high ; 0 would he had never created slumber, But given a deathless, tireless soul, And nectar been gushing from founts without number, That we for ever might swig at the bowl ! '"], [107, "DEVIL AND ANGEL. 99 \" Did we not applaud the sentiment round after round ! You see we could go at it day and night then, and the stuff would cost nothing.\" \" Aye, aye, those would be giddy times. I feel very heavy this morning: turn out, and let us have a box.\" So the two clerks turned out into that part of the office which was used for the waiting room, and began sparring at each other as scientifically as Cribb and Molyneux. There was more sparring and dancing round each other, then feints at blows. After they had been at this play a short time, and got themselves a little warmed, Mr. Goader entered. They each flew to their places, but not before he saw some of the game they were at. He looked at each of them for marks of the combat, then at their work, giving them directions thereon. He tried to ascertain whether they were in earnest or play, without directly asking the question, and having satisfied himself there was no malice, he went into his own room. \" We were as near as a toucher of being caught,\" said one of them ; \" but I feel warmed, and now am ready for work.\" \" It has done me as much good,\" said the other, \" as a glass of something short does the man who has been drunk on the over night.\" The bell was rung, and the string which hung dangling between the clerks, and by which the latch of the office was opened, was pulled. \" Is the governor in ?\" said Mr. Levy, he having been the person who pulled the bell. \" He is in his room.\" \" Any one with him ? \" \" No ; he has but just come.\" Mr. Levy knocked at the door with his knuckles. \" Come in,\" was called from the inside. When Mr. Levy entered, Mr. Goader seemed engaged among his papers. When he lifted his head up to look at his visitor, his face had an expression of surprise ; transient, though, for he was a man of too much experience to allow it to remain there long. Yet his face was as much one of the tools he used as pens and ink, and paper and parchment, a writ of summons, or an execution. If blandness and smiles were required, it expressed blaudness and smiles ; if an expression of wisdom was required, it had an expression as wise as an owl's ; if an expression of severity was required for any one who did not comply with his desires, there was an expression of the sternest severity. It was in truth one of the tools of the office, and was used as such. \"I want to consult you,\" said Mr. Levy, \" about the bond you drew up for"], [108, "100 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. me, securing the money I advanced the jeweller. I want my money.\" \" How want your money ;\" said Mr. Goader, \" are you pressed?\" \"No,\" said Mr. Levy, \"I am not pressed. I want my money.\" \" Because,\" continued Mr. Goader, with out uoticing the answer he had received, \" the law permits many things to be done under pressure wbich it will punish if done without pressure. For instance, you may sell your stock for one fourth of its price when under pressure ; it would call it reckless trading if you were not. Also, you may sell your stock at the same or greater sacrifice to pay your legal expenses; for the law, with the most profound wisdom, takes especial care of itself and all its officers. The law, Sir, is a great machine, a wonderful invention . the wisdom of the wisest heads which have adorned and illustrated our race. It is expensive to move, but then it moves with such impartiality. The plaintiff in the first instance pays down the ready cash, and if the defendant lose he repays just as much as tbe law in its wisdom thinks proper. If the plaintiff lose, why then it allows the defendant what in its wisdom it thinks proper. It is just, Sir, in all its dealings ; sternly just. It is a matter of indifference who wins or who loses. Pity aud mercy give way to justice. A man with a county for an estate may be reduced by litigation to poverty; the law is wise and sheds no tear, A pedigree which can reach in one unbroken line to the Conquest may end in beggary ; the law does not grieve. Homes may be made desolate ; families that have been respected may become wandering paupers ; the law has no qualms. Sir, it is a wonderful invention, and a mighty palladium.\" \" Yes,\" said Mr. Levy, \" it is like my nation, all head, and not heart enough for a mouse ; you could not see its heart with one microscope. It has great wisdom, Mr. Goader, very ; and it is very, very, very greedy. It has a stomach that would swallow up all and be hungry still. It is nothing in the world but bead and stomach. It is, as you say, a wonderful invention ; but I sometimes think it would have been just as well if it had never been invented. We settle our disputes in my nation very much better ; but as you say, it is a wonderful invention, with one very large stomach. A stomach that is never satisfied; hungry, hungry, always hungry,\" and the Jew and the lawyer laughed at the description they each gave \u2014"], [109, "101 DEVIL AND ANGEL. half true and half sarcastic. \"But what about the jeweller; what about him ?\" said Mr. Goader. \" I have been very credibly informed,\" replied Mr. Levy, \" that he has met with a difficulty at the bank, and we know that he has had to borrow money, and I want it back.\" \" Met with a difficulty at the bank, has he. What is the difficulty ?\" \" My informant did not say,\" said Mr. Levy ; \" but we can guess, there is but one difficulty there. He owes them money, and they want it. He owes me money, and I want it. I must be there before them.\" \"But how?\" said Mr Goader; \"your money is not due; you can take no step yet.\" \" Arrest him,\" said Mr. Levy, \" and make him pay, or give me so much of his stock as will help out mv securitv.\" \" I cannot arrest him upon the bund yet. Have you anything else upon wbich I can do it. ' \"You can arrest him whether it be right or wrong, and then we wid make him pay.\" \" What if he turn restive, Mr. Levy, and defy you ? It will be very expensive. He may come upon you for damages. If we could frighten him into compliance, something might be done; but I think he is one of those sort of men it is mischievous to frighten. We shall arouse a spirit within him I shouid not care about, if we were right. I should be able to make a very res pectable bill out of his aroused spirit and sense of injustice ; but you see it might be a bill wbich you would have to pay, and then what do you say? You perhaps would not like that. We must not arrest him. Cannot you get in his debt in some way, and keep in his debt until your bond is due. You would then have the ac count as security for the bond, and would not at least lose so much.\" \" He wants full price for his goods. I cannot give him full price. I should lose money by giving him full price. I can get goods at my own price, and Dot at his price. I have him not yet under my thumb ; but when my bond is due, then if be do not pay I have him under my thumb, and I will have his goods at my own price ; but if I wait for that the bank will be first, and there will be nothing at all for me.\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Goader, \" perhaps we can do something for you. I will write him to call upon me. You want more security, and must have it. Now this is not a case in which we can hope to win by the terror of the law. We must not show its sternness ; we must cajole, and be supple. I shall, if necessary, represent you as a"], [110, "102 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. demon of rapacity. I shall know of cases in which you have ruined a man who resisted your desires, and imprisoned him, and kept him in prison until be was not only ruined, but broken hearted, and life, which ought to have been his happiness, was his bane and his sorrow ; and I shall know of cases in which a man temporarily pressed, complied with your wishes, and you helped him, and served him, and became his fast friend, treating him with the humanity of a true Christian, not with the selfish rapacity of a Jew. I shall advise him to comply with your desires. I shall desire to serve him. I shall be his friend. I shall give him the same advice as if I had been his own legal adviser, and as a man in whose welfare I had taken a deep interest. Now you must not be offended if I represent you as the spirit of evil, and myself as the angel who is trying to keep the good man out of the power of the evil one.\" \" Ha, ha, ha ! Mr. Goader, you are a devil of an angel. Ha, ha, ha ! You make me laugh. Ha, ha, ha ! \" And they both laughed with a loud ha, ha, ha ! \" Mind,\" said Mr. Goader, \" you are to be the devil, and I am to be the angel. Ha, ha, ha !

Jacob's well. Has it ever been your good fortune to sit in a picture gallery alone, surrounded by the works of the best artists of ancient and modern times, who have almost made the canvass speak and breathe, the soul shine in the face of beauty, and mantle into a smile ; the gem sparkle with a fiery flash, and the jewel, set in elaborate and gorgeous workmanship, blaze like reality ? Have you admired the glowing landscape, with its far-away lights and shadows, and marked its tone as it were the voice of a living thing, and the rising glories of the morn ; the splendour of the day, and the melancholy which mellows the evening hour ? Have you read the story wbich has been told, and drunk in the thoughts by which the master mind had made his canvass live ? Has the storm seemed to roar, and bend and break the giants of the forest ? Has the sea seemed in a mighty rage, and the bark of proud man its plaything ? Has the winter piece seemed to freeze you, and the summer piece to glow with a genial warmth ? Have you turned from the painting to the painter ? Have you wondered at the skill with which geuius had expressed its burn- ing thoughts ? Have you, in admiration of the great men by whose works you were surrounded, almost worshipped them ? Have you thought what fame those pictures gave \u2014 how those works stood forth and boldly spoke the praises of tbe artists, and were monuments which should praise them as long as the canvass should last, and soul should drink in the emanations of soul ? and has the thought ever come across your mind that these works which had aroused your enthusiasm were but tbe representation of things more wonderful still ?

Have you stood upon the beetling cliff, against which the storms of oc-an beat in vain ; and as you looked across those mighty waters, thought that far away there were lands as blessed and happy as your own, to whom the sun went down in unrivalled glory ? Have you thought that on the land, in the earth, iu the air, and in the sea, tbat where there was room to live there was life ; and that where there was life there was enjoyment ; and when this thought came upon you, with all its burning power, have you asked yourself who was the maker of all ? who gave genius to the artist, and who gave life to every living thing? And as the heavens, all bespangled with lights which shone from distant worlds larger than yours, moved on in one mighty march, have tbe words of the Psalmist leaped into your mind with an irresistible power, \"All Thy works praise Thee, O God ; yea, all Thy works praise Thee ? \" And have you thought how little and perverted are those who look at the storm and see nothing but its ravages ? who look at the pestilence and see nothing but the sickness and death it scatters around ? who look abroad upon the summer landscape and see nothing but the dead leaf, the withered branch, tbe abortive flower, or the drowned insect ? who rise in the morning aud see nothing but the worm which has lost its way and loses its life as a consequence of its errors ? who hear nothing but moaning in the wind, sighing in the breeze, and the cry of grief and of death in everything ? who look in tbe human heart and see nothing but blackness and in gratitude ; and in the countenance of man and see nothing but furrows and frowns ? who look upon God himself and see nothing in his character but the tyranny of an Eastern despot \u2014 men who think there is nothing in any one's heart to love \u2014 nothing in any one's faith to admire \u2014 nothing in the face of nature to in duce them to bow down and worship its author ? If you have done so, you know that there is more success than failure in the world \u2014 more of happiness than of misery. More mercy in the heart of man than in his creed ; and that all nature is but one great poem, whose subject is the love, the kindness, and the sleepless care of its Almighty author. As my father, mother, and I were sitting in the parlour, Mary came in with a message, and said, \" If you please, Sir, Old Joe"], [113, "JACOBS WELL. 105 wants to speak to you.\" \" Tell him to come in,\" said my father. He came in, my mother put a chair up to the table, which I thought wrong, for it was like making him one of us, and told him to sit down. He put his hat upon the mat and sat dowD, at the same time looking at me as a spaniel does at his master after he has received a beating. My mother picked up his hat and hung it upon the hat rail. As she did so Old Joe looked at me full in the face, and I thought his eyes looked moist, as if the simple act of giving him a chair and hanging his hat upon the nail had aroused a feeling in his heart which rushed into his eyes to weep. My mother ordered Mary to draw him a glass of beer, and gave her the key of the barrel to do so. I saw Mary look at the key and hesitate. She then went into the cellar, and brought him a glass of ale. My mother looked at the key and at the glass, then put the key iuto her pocket. Now Mary was told to tiraw him beer she knew, or why did she hesitate that my mother had given her the key of the ale ? She looked at me, too, when she went to draw it, and when she came with the ale in her hand she also looked at me. She knew there was a mistake in Old Joe's favour, and was determined to let him have the benefit of it. Old Joe took up the glass, and said to my father, \" Here's to your health, Sir ; \" and to my mother, \" Here's to your health, Ma'am ; \" and to me he said, \" Here's my service to you.\" Now there was a difference in the tone of all three wishes. That to my father was in the tone of familiar respect ; in that to my mother there was a little trembling, and the \" timbre,\" as the musicians say, was that of gratitude; that to me w7as as the servant to his master, in which a quick ear could detect a little defiance \u2014 but only a little. As he finished drinking our healths, he turned round with the glass in his hand to drink Mary's ; but she was gone. Now he drank our three healths in one draught, and he meant to have drunk Mary's by itself. At the time I could not. un derstand this, but I know now that he did it on principle : he thought it not respectful to drink the health of the master and servant at the same draught; so he had determined to drink Mary's separately in a draught by itself. At that time I did not know Old Joe's character ; aud yet I had grown up from childhood before him. I put a version and a gloss upon his"], [114, "106 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. actions I know was wrong ; I was therefore not guided by the facts in my conduct towards him, but by the version of those facts which I had formed \u2014 a proceeding which I have often observed in the conduct of others. \" Master,\" said Old Joe, \" I want to ask you for a day's holiday to-morrow. I thought perhaps as trade is not very good, you could spare me for one day. I want to go home, Master \u2014 to see the old home once again.\" \"But Joe,\" said my mother, \"I thought you went home every night.\" \" I mean where I was born ; where my father and mother lived, and all of us. There is no other place a home to me, Ma'am, until I get to that final home at which we shall all at last arrive.\" How long is it since you left your home ?\" said my father. \" It will be fifty-seven years next birthday,\" said old Joe. \" I came to be apprenticed to your father ; and though there were but fourteen years of my life spent there and fifty-seven in this town, still that is my home ; it was the home of my father and mother and all of us, and all through life I have not been able to feel that any other place was a home to me/' \"Did your wife and you live happily?\" said my mother. \" Yes, Ma'am,\" said Joe, shortly and sharply, with a slight jerk of his head, and holding his hand across the table as if he were about to make a speech. The question had roused the old man. \"Yes, Ma'am, nobody lived happier; and if I had to go through life again with the knowledge I now have to guide me, and had all the women in the world to choose from, I should choose none but her ; she was always kind to me. Yes, Ma'am, she was a good woman \u2014 a good wife, and a good companion.\" This answer touched my mother, and she said, \" Do you smoke, Joe ?\" \" Not now, Ma'am, if you please. Sbe was a treasure to me, and I know now how a woman can be a crown of glory to her husband. Why Ma'am, if 1 had been so placed in the world among the great folks that I could have had a crown of the greatest glory put upon my old head, it could not have made me so proud and so happy as my old wench made me ;\" and the old man wiped a tear from off his eye. \" Yet,\" said my father, \" you could not feel that where you lived so happily together was your home?\" \"It is our children's home. AVhenever they come to see me they say they are coming home. Where their father and mother lived is their home ; and where"], [115, "Jacob's avell. 107 my father and mother lived is my home.\" \" Well, Joe,\" said my father, \" you shall have to-morrow ; and if you find anything particularly attractive, I shall not feel offended if you stop the next day.\" \" Joe,\" said my mother, \" I have observed that whenever you can get a flower or a bit of a leaf to put in your button-hole, you do it, and I like to see it. Whoever is fond of flowers has got a kind heart. I think it is a mark of playful kindness in nature to have made flowers of so many forms and of such beautiful colours ; to have made the season of love among plants also the season of beauty. I like to see an old man fond of flowers. Now, here is one here, Joe, that will just do for you to wear when you go home ;\" and she took from the posy of flowers which stood upon the sideboard one of the most graceful and put it in his button-hole. She stood back a little way to look at it. Then she put a small sprig of green al the back ; at the same time I distinctly saw her slip a half-crown into bis hand, and heard her whisper, \" Your expenses.\" Now I thought that too bad, for Old Joe had defied me, and my mother was rewarding him for the defiance. I did not say anything, but \u2014 \" Never mind,\" thought I, \" every dog has his day ; it will be mine some time.\" My mother and Old Joe looked at me with an apologetic look as if she had done a weak thing, and he afraid that I should see it. They both treated me as a spoiled child ; and I am afraid they were right. Old Joe went home and returned on the following evening bringing my mother a posy of as fine flowers as I have ever seen. \" Well, Joe,\" said my father, \" did you find your home all you expected ?\" \" Master, you see it was this : when my father and mother were alive \u2014 God help them, I hope they are in heaven now \u2014 there was no man worked harder than he, and there was no woman more careful than she. She was a good wife to him. Master, it is a blessed thing to have a good wife, is it not ?\" \" I have no experience, Joe, and do not know.\" \" Now,\" said my mother, \" if you say that again I will box your ears ; you know I have been a good wife to you.\" \" Never mind, let that pass,\" said my father, \" she has been fairish, and I suppose I ought to be thankful.\" \" Ah, Master, you are joking ; I have not watched you all your married life without seeing what I have seen.\""], [116, "108 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" Well, well, Joe,\" said my father, \" I do not complain, I have learnt to bear all my afflictions with Christian fortitude.\" \" There,\" said my mother, giving my father a playful box on the ear, \" you take that.\" \" Of course you see, Joe,\" said my father, \"when a woman uses the argumentuin knock-um-dowu-um, a man is bound to be convinced, so I say yes.\" \" Well, Master, well, you see my father by diligence saved himself some money, and built himself a house and a small shopping, in which he carried on his trade. Master, you see my father's name was Jacob, and he bought 8 parcel of a field, and spread his tent there, aud he dug a well in that field, and we used to call it Jacob's well. Now there was not such water in all England as iu that well, it was so sweet and so cool. There were a many of us, Master, aud when my father died the property had to be sold, and the money was divided amongst us, but we always called it our freehold. Wheu I got home I found the property iu the hands of the Koman Catholics, and they had built a chapel on it, but Jacob's well was there still, and there was a young woman at the well drawing water. So I said to her : ' Young woman, will you give me a glass of water out of that well. My father dug it, aud there is not such water in the world as that.' So the young woman went into the house, and brought me a glass, and I drank a glass of that water. Master, it was as nice and as sweet as it was fifty-seven years ago ; and as I was talking to the young woman a priest came out to know what I wanted, for you know, Master, these unmarried priests cannot think that even an old man like me can talk to a young woman in sinless innocence. So I told him that it was my father's well, and the sweetest water in all the world. Then he told me to drink what I wanted, and come into the house when I had done. So I went iuto the house, and he gave me a glass of wine, for he said that water alone was too cold for the stomach of an old man, and I told him all about it \u2014 how my father bought a parcel of a field, and pitched his tent there, and how we always called the well Jacob's well ; and he told me whenever I came that way to call to drink thereat, and that he would always give me a glass of wine with it. Now I have heard people say that those Catholics are not Christians, but I do not believe it, Master; do you ?\" \" Why, Joe,\" said my father, \" I think a man is the greatest Christian who does good"], [117, "Jacob's well. 109 deeds, and not he who has nothing but a creed for his merits.\" \" That is what I say, Master, and when we come to be judged at the last day, 'what good did we do in the world?' will be the question we shall have to answer, and not what we believed. Master, there will be many a man saved then whom people, who pretend to know so much, say will be damned. I do not think that the Judge will be a Judge you can flatter, but I do believe there will be mercy and kindness in all His judgments.\" \"And so do I, Joe,\" said my father ; \" the helping hand, the kind heart, the good man, will not be condemned because he could not believe every man's creed.\" \" Amen,\" said Old Joe , \" Amen,\" said my mother."], [118, "110 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTEK XIX. TEMPTATION. In Mr. Goader's offices, or at least that part of them which formed the clerks' offices and the waiting room, there were three bells \u2014 one the door bell, and the other two in communication with Mr. Goader's room, that is a bell for each of the clerks. I have often speculated why he did not make one bell do ; one ring upon the bell would have done for one clerk and two rings for the other. If they were there for show it would have looked more respectable to have had a row of bells, and more in character with the man. The clerks were busy writing when one of the bells rung. \"Your bell, Mr. Twittles,\" and Mr. Twittles went into Mr. Goader's room. \" Did vou take that note to the jeweller?\" \"I did, Sir.\" \"Who did you see?\" \" He himself.\" \" What did he say ?\" \" He said he would call directly.\" Just at this time the door bell rang, and Mr. Twittles looked out at the door, and saw it was my father who had come. He again entered Mr. Goader's room aud shut the door. \" Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr. Goader, \" put these drafts in that drawer and bring me those deeds here, and hand me Gilbert's Law of Uses, and in three minutes send the jeweller in.\" This was done. This changing about of deeds and documents had been done so frequently in cases like my father's that Mr. Twittles well understood what it meant. At one time they were brought out of the drawers and placed upon the table ; at another put into the drawers, and this so frequently, that Mr. Twittles knew that time and the appearance of business was all it meant, he therefore fell iuto the humour and assisted"], [119, "111 TEMPTATION. Mr. Goader in the scheme. Having done this he left Mr. Goader's room, and went to his own desk, looked over the copy upon which he had been engaged, and having occupied himself about the time he thought was required, he went into Mr. Goader's room again, and said, \" Shall I tell him to come in. Sir? \" \" Let me see,\" said Mr. Goader, looking about his f esk, and picking up one paper and putting it down, then another, like a man so full of business that he was bewildered ; \" yes, send him in.\" Mr. Twittles went out and said to my father, \" Walk in, Sir.\" \" Good morning,\" said Mr. Goader. \" Good morning,\" was my father's reply. Mr. Goader kept moving about his papers in the same bewildered way as before. \" I want to speak to you,\" said he in a very absent manner; \"I want to speak to you. Excuse me one moment, I want to speak to you. W'here can it be,\" continued he in the same absent disjointed manner. \" Just one moment. Take a seat. Aye, yes,\" and he put some deeds by themselves, and some copies and some drafts, until he had made a little pile of them. \" Sometimes,\" said he, in the same inanimate manner, \" we have a deal of trouble with these titles ; my business, you see, is mostly conveyancing. I should prefer it to be all such, but to oblige my clients I take other business \u2014 other business. I take other business. Yes ; aye, other business, not always agreeable ; but you see \u2014 yes, to oblige my clients.\" Now this was said in a slow, bewildered, absent, and disjointed manner. In two or three minutes he threw off his bewildered manner, and said to my father, as if he had just seen him, \" Oh, here, take this chair,\" at the same time handing my father a well-cushioned arm-chair, of which there were two in the office, and occupying the other himself, he sat down to have a bit of comfortable chat. Now this sort of conduct might have imposed upon some men, and they would have said, \"Mr. Goader is a very nice man ; when I went into his office he was very civd and obliging, and made me sit in his best arm-chair ;\" but upon my father it produced the opposite effect ; he knew the man, and this conduct made him very watchful. \" We have had a severe run upon the banks, and we must not wonder at the bankers being very pressing in return ; but these are things that want management, Sir, management \u2014 time and management. By the way, how is your wife, and your son ? I see he is a"], [120, "112 recollections of a tradesman. young man of great observation. Sees as much of a subject at a glance as another would take days and years to see ; by nature quick, and of intuitive perception.\" My father saw that all this was but patting the horse upon the neck and falsing a bit before he jumped upon his back and put him to his paces. He there fore received it very coldly, and Mr. Goader saw it had not produced the impiession he had intended. Yet not to be defeated, he tried another plan. With him all the best feelings of the human heart were but tools, with which he worked out his ends. His clients had reposed in him with open confidence the difficulties they endured, and the feelings and resentments those difficulties aroused. It was his profession and his practice to take up either side of a question, therefore had he learned the effect these tools produced, and the best mode of using them. \" I am told,\" said he, \" that you have taken one of the wisest ways of conducting business, that of making a good article and having your price. It takes a little longer time, perhaps, to get into the market, but when there you keep there. On the contrary, when you make a cheap article you have no hold upon the market ; every fellow whose necessities press can take your customers away from you with the greatest ease : undersell you, and your customer is gone. All the men my clients have difficulties with are those cheap John fellows ; they make for the ready money and whistle for the profit, and as a natural consequence they cannot pay their way. Then you see I have nothing to do but to pull them to pieces \u2014 to skin them for my clients, and ruin them for the benefit of trade. But there are always plenty of simpletons in the world ; as soon as one is brought to grief another steps into his place, and is brought here for me to do execution upon. I have a continued succession of such fools in my office. I always do my best for them, aud when I see a man striving to live and be honest in all his dealings, I use my influence with my clients to give him the opportunity he wants. If you break a man up you can write settled to the account, but you seldom do much else. Though I have had much experience in life, I cannot tell when a man ought to be broken up. I have had clients who appeared irretrievably insolvent. By my advice they have kept to the business, and are now the leading men of the town, and very"], [121, "113 TEMPTATION. wealthy. I never advise that a man, who meets me in a fair and honourable way, should be broken up; rather I would assist him. I feel a great pleasure in doing an act of kindness to such a man. W e all have our difficulties sometime or other in life ; and if we had not a fellow-feeling, what would become of us ? AA'ithout each other's assistance we might be left to meet our death even deserted and alone. The profession which it has been my mis fortune to follow is often charged with cold-hearted severity ; but it has a kindly as well as a repulsive side. Witness the care it takes of the poor and the infirm, and those who have to endure the greatest affliction to which the human mind is subject : I mean the insane. And even those who bid defiance to all the laws which govern society \u2014 I mean our criminal popu lation \u2014 the law cares for them with the kindness of a mother ; it feeds them with the best of food ; it lodges them in comfortable cells; it provides a doctor for them when ill, aud a spiritual ad viser to show them the way they ought to go, if it be a little abrupt with poverty, and will have its due even though povertv have not wherewithal to pay \u2014 and the law is not contented until it has stripped it of all it has, and sometimes not even then; yet that is not the fault of the law, but of the hardness of the man who invokes the law ; for the law has always a leaning on the side of mercy. I can say this safely, tbat if a man meets me honestly and openly to the best of his ability, I always advise a merciful proceeding.\" \" What does all this mean ? \" thought my father ; \" I have heard that the devil will sometimes set up as a teacher of morality and religion, and even pray like a godly man, when he thinks that godliness is a profitable profession.\" W hen my father $old me of this conversation, he said that the genuine man was to be known by his actions \u2014 the counterfeit by his professions ; and that I might depend upon it as being a truth, without exception, that the man who, on every favourable opportunity, bragged of hi3 good deeds, had in truth no good deed* to brag about ; that the man who put himself where what little good he did could be observed, had but little good in him. The silent worker was the most useful and the most deserving of praise. \" I need not tell you,\" continued Mr. Goader, \" that in times like these there are some people who become foolishly alarmed ; but all you have to do with such people is not to"], [122, "114 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. oppose them, for by so doing you increase that alarm, but to yield in some little trifling matter by which this alarm will be appeased, and they will sink into their usual quietude as suddenly and completely as they were suddenly and completely alarmed. The quiet and the yielding pass through the world easy, while the high-spirited aud the stubborn are always in trouble. I think it the best wisdom and the best practice to advise my clients to yield \u2014 to be governed or guided by any feeling arising from a sense of injustice is all bosh. Do not oppose an act because you think it unjust, but meet it in some simple, quiet way, and put the injustice quietly in your pocket. Now, of all foolish men to be alarmed, is our friend Mr. Levy.\" \" 0 I \" thought my father, \" you are there, are you.\" \" He, of all men, has the least cause for alarm ; but it is the temperament of the man \u2014 he cannot help it. When he meets with opposition he is the most outrageous of all my clients. He will follow a man with the most diabolical pertinacity to his utter ruin. He has a special delight in bringing his opponent to the ground and placing his foot upon his neck ; but if his opponent be reasonable, there is no man so willing to assist him \u2014 indeed he is then a prodigal in benevolence, and affords help with the greatest profusion. Now you see the character of the man.\" \" Oh yes ! \" said my father, \" I perfectly understand him.\" \" And,\" continued Mr. Goader, \" such is the impartiality of the law, that it places the same weapons in the hands of a wilful, inconsiderate, and passionate man \u2014 aye, of the hardest and most devilish temper \u2014 as in the hands of him who is overflowing with humanity. That I think wrong, for there are some men so inconsiderate and inhuman that they ought not to be entrusted with anv weapons ; and others whose native kindness is so great that they might be safely entrusted with the keenest weapons,, for they woultl never be abused. But you and I have lived long enough in the world to know that we must take men as we find them, and submit to the course of events. Indeed I say it is better to suffer some in justice than to invoke the spirit of the law. I am sorry to say that there are some evil spirits who have to move it, who, when once invoked, will never be laid to rest again, as long as a piece of gold glitters within their reach. Now, these times have alarmed Mr. Levy, and he thinks the money he advanced"], [123, "TEMPTATION. 115 you is not secure, a fear that I have tried to laugh him out of ; but, as I have told you, he is a man that any sort of opposition only makes worse. He has instructed me to obtain from you further security. Can you give it ? \" \" I do not see,\" said my father, \"that further security is required. The money, you know, is not yet due, and it will be time enough to talk about that when my inability to discharge the obligation is ascertained.\" \" I suppose your stock is large and valuable ?\" said Mr. Goader. \" It is,\" said my father. \" If I were you I would convert some of it into monev , and your furniture, no doubt, is expensive.\" This last question was put as much with the intention of creating alarm as to ascertain the value of the property upon wliich he might be called upon to operate. He had found it the strongest of the weapons in all a lawyer's vocabulary, for what can be more humbling to tbe proudest heart than the thought that he is about to be stripped of all his property, and his household goods, and to be turned into the streets to bide the ingratitude of man and the inclemency of heaven ? It has reduced many an one so low that they have done and promised anything to avert the dire calamity. When these tyrannical weapons are used by a tyrant, in what distant or dark land, or in what middle passage where slaves are lashed and trodden down, is there oppression so oppressive ? \" I hope and believe, Mr. Goader, that I shall be able to meet my engagement when the time arrives,\" said my father. \" Well, well, I hope so too,\" was the reply ; \" but it is much better to have a friend to deal with than an enemy, and I advise you, as your friend, to be compliant. A pound or two to you, in times like these, is nothing. If you arouse his temper I would not undertake the contest for several hundreds. Unless your purse is a much deeper one than circumstances assure me it is, you will have cause to rue the day you neglected to follow my advice. Now, look you here : legally the property in your possession is yours, and legally, so many persons may have claims upon that property that noue ol it may be yours. Suppose, now, they become alarmed, as Mr. levy is, and they refuse to receive payment as your money comes to hand, but will all of them be paid at the same time \u2014 in fact, that the day of scrambling comes, led on by as many lawyers as you have creditors. Why,"], [124, "116 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. we shall very soon see that what property you have will be lost in expenses and forced sales. What will have to be contended for then will be the property of your creditors. They will have to bear all the expenses of the contention. We lawyers shall gain, and, if we nurse it awhile, we shall gain greatly. There will no longer be inhumanity to you. We shall be punishing your creditors for their want of forbearance. It will be their property we shall divide among us. There will be the cold shoulder, and an outcry against you for nine days, then you will be received into sociely again, a wiser if not a better man. Now, I will make a confession to you. Whenever we lawyers can get a large property into bankruptcy, we all try to be in it ; if we can get in it, we keep there, imagining all sorts of difficulties, and raisiug all sorts of objections, procuring ad journment after adjournment upon any frivolous pretence. We have a fee for everything ; therefore, all these things are to our gain. The creditors, poor simple fellows, think we are animated by their feelings of resentment and revenge. No, we are only animated by a desire to increase the size of our bills ; and, while there is any money left, we part with the estate with regret. I think you see what I mean. If you should be asked to sacrifice some of your property by reducing your price, you will avoid trouble, aud find it cheaper in the end.\" \" I understand you,\" said my father. \" It has hitherto been my practice not to get into oue difficulty to relieve myself of another, but to meet them to the best of my ability, to do right as far as I am able, and that shall still be my guide.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Goader, \" I have advised you as I should advise one of my own clients. I can say no more. A wilful man must have a wilful man's fate. I wish you good morning.\" As my father left Mr. Goader's room, Mr. Mincher was in the waiting room. A cold recognition took place between them, and they were surprised at each other's presence. My father observed that Mr. Mincher was desirous of concealing something he carried under hi3 cloak, and, being quick in observation, he saw it was a fiddle box. But why should that need to be concealed ? Surely there is nothing in the delicious art of music of which any one should be ashamed. Certainly a fiddle is altogether out of place in a lawyer's office ; but why should he be afraid my father should see his fiddle box ? On"], [125, "TEMPTATION. 117 looking at it again he saw about half an inch of red tape near one of the hooks. \" That is a strange fashion,\" thought my father, \" to tie up a fiddle with red tape, and just the same coloured tape, too, that is used to tie up deeds. O I see, it is not a fiddle. How very odd.\" It was very odd.

You shall at the same time make out a list and enter our price against each article \u2014 enter all the rings together, as also the brooches, and the pins and studs and bracelets, and all the finished stock ; so arranging it that we can tell at once what we have got, and its value.\" So I got the book into which we usually entered the stock, and began my work. Wre kept the different articles in drawers which we called trays. I said, \" Father, suppose I number the trays and enter in my book what is on each tray. It will help to correct any mistakes that may be made.\" \" So it will, John,\" said my father ; \" do so.\" Now, I had got two or three of these trays before me, sorting out and classifying their contents, when Mr. Levy came into the warehouse. There was such an expression of fear and surprise upon his countenance that I felt greatly pained. He had heard of my father being at the bank. He saw me taking stock, and his fears threw him into a panic. He took his theory to the facts, and compelled the facts to support his theory. My father had been to the bank, looked troubled and distressed when he came out ; that meant that he was asked by the banker to pay up his account, and could not. He was taking stock now ; that meant that the banker wanted to know the state of his affairs. He looked all around the warehouse, expect ing to find an accountant at work in some retired and concealed place ; and though he could not see him, he yet believed him to be there, and that we had completely concealed him. He thought and felt that because he had advanced my father a little money he had a right to walk over the place to see what we had got and"], [127, "119 HARSHNESS. what we were doing, aud his manner made me afraid that he would pick up the trays and appropriate the contents to his own use by way of security. As my father had gone down into the house when I began to enter the stock, I was in the warehouse by myself when Mr. Levy entered. I dared not leave him while I went to call my father, for I thought him too frightened to be honest. I was afraid he would take possession of as much jewellery as he could, and then say \u2014 \" Pay me the money you owe ; then you shall have the goods again.\" He was so frightened that no sense of what was right would restrain him, and no law which he was so ready to invoke against others would control him. \" Mine God!\" said he, \"is it come to that? Where is your father ?\" \" He has just gone out,\" I said. \" I must see him ; I want my money. I must see him before I go. I will wait \u2014 I must have my money. Oh what a fool I was to let my money go! Mine God ! but I will make your father rue.\" I was surprised at this outburst of passion. \" No workpeople ! Your father away. You taking stock ! \" I was going to say, \" It was a misfortune that we had no work for the people to do ;\" but he stopped me as soon as I had said \" It was a mis- fortune \u2014 .\" \"Misfortune,\" said he; \" what has misfortune to do with me ? I want my money. If you were all crushed and broken, and utterly ruined, what would that be to me ? I do not care about your misfortunes. I want my money, and I will have it before I leave this place \u2014 or else, mine God ! I will makeyour father rue. I wdl put him in prison, and there he shall lie and rot. Your country laws will let me do that, and I will do it.\" I was alarmed at this sudden and unexpected outburst of passion, and said, \" Surely you will have mercy.\" \" Mercy,\" said he; \" what has mercy to do with me ; will mercy bring me my money ? No. The only mercy I will show will be to ruin him, if I am not paid. Mercy ! what has mercy to do with it? I must see your father, and I shall wait here until he comes.

And why should I do otherwise ?\" \" Then,\" said I, \"you have pleasure in your money?\" \"I have pleasure in my money,\" he repeated. \"As you see it grow, your pleasure grows?\" \"As I see it grow, my pleasure grows,\" he responded. \" If it wanes, a gloom, almost despair overcomes y ou ?\" \" Young man, I do not let it wane ; I would crush the man who made the attempt.\" \"You live for money?\" said I. \" I live for money,\" he repeated ; \"you say right, I live for money; and for what else should I live ? Without it, I am a beggar ; without it, I am despised ; without it, every little fellow wags his jaw at me, and preaches folly at me as if it were wisdom. If I have not money, I must take their folly for wisdom ; but if I have money, my folly is wisdom. O blessed be our father Jacob that he did put the skin of the kids upon his hands, and place peeled hazel wands in the hollows of the field ! it was a lesson the God of our Israel gave us, and it hath blessed my nation.\" \" Then,\" said I, \" you love your money for the pleasure it gives you.\" \" You say right ; I love my money for the pleasure it gives me, and for the com manding place in the world it gives me.\" \" But,\" said I, \" may there not be other things than money which give most exquisite pleasure, unalloyed with harshness or deceit, which, to those who have the capacity to feel, is most overwhelming?'' When I said this, he turned round sharply, and said con temptuously, \" Bah ! you are a boy.\" \" Boy as I am,\" quoth I, *' I liave had enough experience to know that there are pleasures in the world far, far greater than money-getting ; and though it is right to get money, and that every man should have his due, yet I would not be the sordid thing whose only joy is in the glitter of gold, whose soul is so cribbed and confined by selfishness that all the joys for which it is a joy to live are neither felt nor understood.\" \" O what fools these Christians are ! \" said he, raising both hands and shaking his head ; \" what lessons they teach their children \u2014 no wonder they become poor; my nation know better, and are rich \" \" I have read, somewhere,\" said I, \" that an old man's heart is in his pocket ; the zest for novelty has long been gone ; nature, with her ever-varying hues, has no joys for him; the face of man gives him no delight; woman's"], [130, "122 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. smiles are as the wiles of the wanton ; the friend would have no friendship if he thought he was not named in the will ; youth fawns upon him but for expectant favours ; all are waiting until he dies \u2014 then will they have a Saturnalia with his wealth, or those who were once friends will quarrel over it and be friends no more. 1 he old man, therefore, turns his back upon the world ; its joys he calls follies ; he bows down before his gold as the joy of joys.\" \" Ah, very true,\" said Mr. Levy, \" wisdom comes to him at last. The only lesson a long life teaches is that there are no enduring charms but the charms of the guinea. Young man, do you begin life with the old man's wisdom, and it will garner up treasures for your old age, and you will be as rich as a Jew. There, now, you cannot preach a more sensible sermon than that ; you cannot begin life with a more sensible lesson. My nation know no other; and they do not wish to learn any other. We have been taught that by our fathers. Young mau, do you expect your father at home soon?\" At this time old Joe came up in the warehouse, and I told him to go and see if my father were in the parlour, and say that Mr. Levy wanted to speak with him. Now, during the time this conversation was taking place, the first fear he had was gradually removed, or rather strongly shaken, so that as soon as old Joe was gone for my father, he said, \" Are you compelled to take stock ?\" \" Compelled to take stock, no,\" said I ; \" it is an act of our own.\" \" Where are your books ?\" said he. \" Where are our books?\" said I, \" why, here they are,\" and I opened the iron safe and showed them to him ; for I thought it better to remove all the false impressions 1 could. Upon this he was very much more calm ; so that when my father came up, he was prepared to do business as quietly as a man of business should, and I was glad of it, for I knew my father's temper well \u2014 violence and injustice always filled him with indignation ; and although he knew and would often say that everything, no matter how bad, should be met calmly and quietly, yet would he meet violence and injustice passionately. When he came up, Mr. Levy was the first to speak ; he went at once, without the least apology, into the business upon which he had called. \" Can you,\" said he, \" pay me the money you borrowed ?\" \" It is not yet due,\" was the reply. \" Due or not due,\" said Mr. Levy, \" I want it, and must have it. The times are not fitted for money lending. I"], [131, "123 HARSHNESS. make a rule of lending my money when times are good, and at no other. Wrhen times are bad I must call it all home again.\" \" Just the time when the debtor is the least able to answer the call,\" replied my father. \" Your money is not yet due ; when it it is will be time enough to think about paying. Every day has its tioubles, and let the troubles of the day be met on the day to which they belong.\" It was evident that both ray father and Mr. Levy were but smothering a feeling which the least look, or tone of speech, or evil word or manner would fire into rage, and I felt very uncomfortable. \" Sir,\" said Mr. Levy, \" this treat ment is very unsuited to your position. I can deal with a man better who meets me ; I have some feeling for him. But the man who defies me, I think it my duty to teach a lesson.\" \" I do not see,\" said my father, \" that there is any defiance in the case. I owe you money, but that money is not yet due. You want it before the time. I tell you that I cannot pay it before the time ; that I think a fair answer to the question, and not a defiant one. You think these times will introduce such confusion and difficulty into my affairs that you intend to save yourself at ail risks. You would snatch a security out of your own brother's hands to make yourself more secure. You would forget all that has been done in the past for your benefit, and think only of the way to relieve your preseut fears. You would harass and harry a friend with as little reluctance as a foe, and run up a bill against a poor man with a zest. Such couduct will receive no assistance from me ; indeed, I should like to punish it, even though I suffered in my own person ; but Mr. Levy, be it how it will, I pay you no money until it is due. It will save the time of both of us if you take that for your answer.\" \" Ah, well,\" said Mr. Levy, \" we shall see.\" As he said so I observed that he trembled with suppressed rage, and that he frequently had to swallow something which arose in his throat, which almost choked him. I thought I saw a settled determination to be savage when the right time should arrive. I knew by my father's firmness that it would be a death struggle when it came, if ever it did. When thoroughly roused, he had a spirit within him that never was conquered, and a perseverance which nothing could turn aside. \" I have a customer,\" said Mr. Levy, \" who wants some of your goods. Shall I look them out ?\" \" You are at liberty to look"], [132, "124 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. out as much as you want,\" said my father, in the same distinct and stately manner. \" John, attend to him.\" My father left him with me to select such stock as he might want. Old Joe followed my father into another part of the premises, and said, \"Master, I want to ask you a favour. I told you, Master, that when my father and mother died we sold the freehold, and divided the money among us. I have got one hundred pounds left \u2014 it is in the bank. I saved it against the time of old age : when my limbs should be weary, my hands should have lost their cunning, when memory should begin to totter in my old head, forgetting all but my early days \u2014 when the lights wliich had been my guide through life should begin to go out, leaving me in my evening in second childhood \u2014 when I should go creeping with tottering steps to an old man's grave, to be transferred from thence to the Great Father of us all who is in heaven. Master, it is in the bank ; I want you to save it for me. Have it, Master ; pay the Jew, and let him go.\" This offer on the part of Old Joe produced a reaction in my father's mind. He had been soured by what he had undergone at Mr. Goader's, and at the treatment from Mr. Levy, and a darkness \u2014 a thick darkness \u2014 had settled upon him. But this offer suddenly broke through the gloom, like the ever blessed sunshine which follows the pitiless storm, and displayed the image of God again in the face of man ; it made the love of his kind, which had been sorely tried, gush to his heait \u2014 as when the lone traveller far away in the desert, sinking under his fatigues in weakness and despair, sees at his feet the flower he had so often plucked in his childhood at home, in his own happy valley \u2014 the thought of lone liness flies away, and that sign is to him a proof that there is a God in the desert, and that if He cares for the lily He cares also for him whom He hath made in His own image. Mv father had been so much among lawyers and money lenders that he had begun to doubt that God had made all men in His own image, for surely the devil made some of them, and in the likeness of himself; but this offer of Old Joe's, Uke a sudden illumination, restored his faith in the old truth that men would not all fall away from the in nocence in which they were made, but, even in the latter days \u2014 when all thiugs for the wickedness of man should melt away in a consuming fire \u2014 there should be some of the blessed one3 left."], [133, "125 TRY IT CHAPTER XXI. TRY IT. As I have said, my father received Old Joe's offer with great delight \u2014 not that he meant to avail himself of it, but because it restored the faith in human nature he had almost lost. There are barren tracks upon the earth, wbich the ever-blessed sun covers with a painful glare ; where the primitive rocks throw up their rugged angles, cutting the traveller's feet until they are sore and bleeding. All around is a dreary, a cheerless, a com fortless scene ; no shieling in which man can rest, no green spot which the most wretched outcast would consent to call his home. Tracks over which the storm-bird screams, and which God hath not yet covered with His creative power. So are there tracks in the human heart, barren and cheerless, stony and flinty, over which a sullen gloom broods, without one green spot to show that the Angel of God, as he flew across that barren waste, ever rested one moment. It is said that in the early ages of the world, when God sent His messengers through the vast eternity of space to see that all His laws worked well, wherever the celestial visitor rested in his flight \u2014 for even an archangel's wing tires as he sweeps over the immense universe \u2014 there was an everlasting verdure, a per petual spring, as if a piece of heaven had come down to embellish and decorate the earth. Yes, there are hearts all rugged and cheerless, all barren and dead ; no flower blossoms there, no ver dure relieves the endless waste, and in which no angel's feet have ever trod. Such hearts have power among men \u2014 power to throw the withering influence of their own nature over better spirits, and becloud with trouble this world of ours, which would otherwise be so happy a one that we should not desire a better among the stars."], [134, "126 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" Joe,\" said my father, \" Mr. Levy thinks I am broken and ruined. Now, if I were to take your money to save for you, it might be lost \u2014 I could not repay you ; what would become of you then? \" \"No fear, Master; do not let that thought disturb you. I have trusted in a good Providence all my days, and He will not desert me now I am old and calmly awaiting His sum mons. No, Master, I have learned one good lesson, that there is a refuge from all trouble, and, if it be sought, it never fails. Try it, Master, try it, and its blessing will comfort you.\" The old man said this with so much solemn earnestness that my father was greatly moved. \" Master, affliction is a blessing to a right mind ; its tears are like the gentle rain on a summer's day ; it makes heaven's loveliest gifts look more lovely. Master, I never felt its power until my old wench died ; then, when I was almost broken-hearted, and used to creep into lonely places to grieve \u2014 I was ashamed to grieve in compf.ny, for my feelings might have made them think me a hypocrite \u2014 I tried it. I found it, Master, a very present comfort ; and, Master, if you will take poor Old Joe's advice, you will try it, and seek comfort before that throne where the supplicant is never denied.\" This was said by Old Joe with a sincerity and a depth of seeling that went straight to my father's heart. \" Who was it, Master, do you think, who sup ported me when I was in great trouble \u2014 when I felt my old heart almost breaking ? Was it me, Master? No. Wrho was it that enabled me to stand up among my fellow-men again, when I thought I had been so stricken that I never could live ? Was it me, Master ? No, it was not me. It was Him, Master, who takes care of all of us.\" As the old man said so, he stretched out his arms and turned his face to heaven, and his countenance had an expression worthy of a saint. \" Joe,\" said my father, \" I thank you for your good advice; but I am afraid, Joe, if I were to give way to such sentiments they would unman me, and make me incapable of contending with the devilries of life. It is a stern firmness I want now, and I feel it is that only will enable me to stand to my duty.\" \" Try a bit of the other feeling, Master ; you will not flag in your duty, but you will be relieved with a blessed comfort. It will lighten your darkest hour, and ease your deepest sorrow. WTe do not know what it is, Master, until grief will not be denied. Before, we laugh at it, and think it whining hypocrisy; but"], [135, "127 TRY IT when overwhelming misfortunes come to our door, we know that it is a blessed truth. Try it, Master, try it.\" \" Well, Joe,\" said my father, \" I will think of it.\" Old Joe looked at my father most imploringly, and said, \" I wish, Master, you would try what 1 have tried.\" \" Joe,\" said my father, \" If I were to have your money, and become a poor bankrupt, I should feel deeply grieved that I had ruined an old servant, because he had been devoted to me, and lent me his all.\" \" Well, Master, well, do not let that make you refuse. I am old now. I have lived close all my life. I have never known what it is to be tended for as gentlefolks are; to be boxed up in a warm house, with carpets on the floor ; to live on best food, and pies, and such like ; to have no ache but a doctor comes, and no want but it is supplied. Poor things ! when poverty comes to them it is heart-breaking work ; it almost makes me cry, Master, when I think of the poor weak things, so proud once, believing they were made of better stuff than us, turned out to buffet with the frowns of that world which once flattered and caded them. Master, how they bear it I cannot tell ; to think on it makes my heart bleed. But me, Master, to whom bread and cheese and beer have been luxuries ; if I have had aches, I have let them ache ; if the wind has blown upon me, I have let it blow ; poverty has no fears for me. W hen the world frowns, I let it frown If folks think themselves better than I am, I let them think so \u2014 it does me no harm, and it pleases them. I do my duty, Master, and it hath hitherto pleased God when one door bus been shut, to open another ; and I do believe, Master, that if Old Joe, or any one else, Master, put their trust in Him, that He will not let every door be shut against them. Never mind about breaking, Master. Set up again. I have been broke many a time.\" \"Yes, Joe, I suppose so; but it does not take so much to set you up as it does me. Breaking is to me a most serious matter ; and, Joe, it is my determination to leave my name unstained to my son. Dark days may come upon me, and friends may break away, but as long as I do my duty, as far as I have ability, I do not see why I should grieve, or care even.\" \" No, Master, no; do your duty, and there is no need to care ; but, Master, if you would try what I have tried, you would have a blessing as well as no need to care.\" By this time Mr. Levy had made his selections from our stock,"], [136, "128 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and on adding them up I found them to amount to one hundred and thirty-five pounds six shillings and fourpeuce. As soon as I had totted up the total he took the invoice from me, holding it in his left hand, smoothing and pulling his beard with his right. He added up the invoice with a whispering noise, then said, \" Young man, give me a pen.\" He ticked off the invoice with the goods. Having done so, he again stroked aud pulled his beard ; then rubbed the end of his pen among it, and acted as if taking counsel with himself. He then laid the invoice upon the counter, spreading both hands upon it to flatten it, and said, \" Young man, call your father.\" T did so ; when my father came, he said, \" 1 have looked out these goods ; now, what will you take for them? \" \"What are they? \" said my father, at the same time opening the daybook, and looking at the entry I had made therein, and comparing the goods therewith. He then said, \" Make out the invoice, and let Mr. Levy have it.\" \" He has one,\" said I. '\u2022 It is a copy of this entry, is it ? \" \" Yes.\" \" Then these,\" said my father, \" are the prices, and the total of your invoice is the price of the whole.\" \" But,\" said Mr. Levy, \" how do you think I can sell them at these prices ? It is impossible. My customer will not give me these prices. I can get goods as good as these at one half the money. I must send them, and you will lose the order. One hundred and thirty-five pounds six shillings and fourpence ! Do you think me a boy, and that I do not know the value of jewellery better than that ? Phew ! \" continued he, with a contemptuous blowing sound ; \" do you hope to sell these at that price ? \" \"I iutend to sell them at no other,\" said my father; \"they cost me the money. I am contented with a small profit, aud do not intend to carry on my business without some profit. 1 had better be an idle fool than a busy fool.\" Mr. Levy saw now that his best course was to try the wheedling way of business. Sunshine will some times accomplish what the storm cannot. \" My customer is a very extensive merchant \u2014 very extensive indeed,\" said he, throw ing out both arms to aid the idea his words expressed, and giving to my father and to me the image of a man whose body would cover an acre at least \u2014 a monster of a man ; but it was his husiness that was extensive, and not the man. \" My customer is a very extensive merchant ; he buys two and three thousand"], [137, "TRY IT 129 pounds worth of jewellery at one time, cash down ; none of your bills. He likes your goods. I do not care what I sell him ; all alike to me ; but he prefers your goods \u2014 that is he prefers vour goods at the same price he can get them for from other people. They are not for his own use ; they are for him to sell, to get money by. Same as me, he does not care for the goods, and I do not care for the goods. He cares for the money, though, and so do I care for the money. Business is nothicg to me but to get money by ; business is nothing to him but to get money by ; and it is nothing to anybody but to get money by. I do not want the business, I want the money. Now, I can do this. He likes your goods ; I can tell him nobody makes such goods as vou ; vou can have the order for the thousands. You let me have these at my price, then when the order of the thousands comes you can make the gold a little poorer. Make yourself right in that way. You sell these I have chosen cheap ; ycu get the customer and the order ; you make the profit out of that \u2014 cne very large profit. I will bring him to you. He can choose his own patterns, you can get your own price.

Now, you see, you get your profit out of the order lor the thousands. I will give you the bond I have for these goods.\" \" What ! \" exclaimed my father, \" give you goods invoiced for one hundred and thirty-five pounds six shillings and fourpence for eighty-one pounds five shillings ?\" \" No, no,\" said Mr. Levy, in his blandest manner, leaning upon the table, and waving his hand, the palm being uppermost. \" No, no, not for that sum ; see the large orders you will get, and the great profit those orders will give ; reckon that as well. W hen you go to sell in the shop you will make the shopman a large present ; you have him to your inn, and you give him wine, and a supper of all the dainties of the season ; you sit up with him all the night; you have the headache the next day. This is a small order. Think of the order my customer will give you. The two or three thousand pounds, cash down ; none of your bills ; none of your long credits.

We let off the guns as soon as he appears in sight, and run the risk of his being at us before we can charge again ; yet we keep swaggering how much more courage we have got than he has, and that one English soldier can beat ten of France. Well, we beat him at Waterloo, but it was a tough job, and between you and I we had to get a great many to help us. Well, peace has come, and public opinion is all against war \u2014 the fighting blood is killed out of us ; but let the young ones grow up, and no matter what has been suffered in our day, they will want to be at it again, and will never think they will have to go through the same suffering. You cannot spend your money in letting off gunpowder and killing and destroying and still have the money in trade. You must suffer until time and trade have given you as much money as you have squandered in war. But public opinion does not say that. It says, the more money you spend, the better for trade; but if that were true, you spend every shilling you have got, and then you will be rich ; and let us all sDend every shilling we have got, and then we shall all be rich. It stands to sense, does it not, if you want to be rich, you must save your money, and not spend it ? And if you want to make trade good, you must spend it in something which will come back again in money or goods, not in powder, which, when it is blown off, is done with. Spending money in war is like spending money in law ; very few indeed become rich by the operation, and those very few are not always the most deserving. But what is public opinion ? There is Mr. Mincher ; he is rich and rides in his carriage ; and because he is rich aud rides in his carriage, we think all his sayings are wise. Those who circulate round him are continually re-echoing his opinions; he hearing no others, naturally thinks his opinion is public opinion. Then there is Mr. Wrongham ; he talks loud and fast, and positively. He will let no one speak but himself; he has all the talk to himself; to give him any answer at all you must be uncivil; he thinks, because he will not give any one lime to contradict him, that every one is of his opinion, and his opinion is public opinion. Then there is our friend Tutin ; lie swears by his newspaper; he says it is his newspaper which is public opinion ; that it creates public opinion, makes public opinion, and is public opinion."], [143, "coachee. 135 But let me tell you this in strictest confidence, I do not want to make trouble either for you or me. It is almost as dangerous to offend a newspaper as it is to offend a parson, they are so very thin skinned. They are sure to snub you ; sure to put you back ; sure to prevent your light appearing before the public, for fear it should make theirs seem like a farthing candle in the sunshine. It is all very well while you flatter and worship them, but if t ou take an independent course you are snubbed ; they will not allow a brighter star than them to shine in their hemisphere. Let me tell you this, to think that a newspaper is public opinion, is all bosh. It would be a good thing if it were ; we might then hope to have some sense in public opinion, and know how to coutrol it. -Now let me tell you this, that whenever a man says public opinion will not stand this or that, or will not allow the other to be done, tnat he is hard up for an argument, and means no more than that his opinion is public opinion \" \" After all that,\" said Jack Sprat, \" I suppose we are to take Billy Blunt's opinion for public opinion.' \" My opinion is my opinion,\" said Mr. Blunt ; \" at any rate 1 have got an opinion. I do not think some folks have ; at least, if they have, it is not good for much. Here is to your health, Tom.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Blunt ; drink it up. Here is to your health in return,\" replied Tom, the individual thus addressed. Now Tom was the driver of a hackney coach. It is a fact, which, if I were a philosopher, I should attempt to explain, that there is not a hackney coachman in the three kingdoms, nor in any part of the world where hackney coachmen ply, but is always trying to impose upon that part of the community who employ hackney coachmen ; at least, they say so, but Tom always said the \" t'other.\" \" You see,\" says he, \"it is the fare as makes the regulations ; they says what it must be ; they says where we must plv; they says we must wear a badge ; they says the number ; they says we must stand at our bosses' heads ; they says we must not laugh, nor joke, nor chaff ; they says we must not whip a dog when he has got a tin kettle tied to his tail ; they says when we sees a green un on a hossback for the first time, sticking his spurs in his lioss for fear he should tumble off, and his hoss a wisking his tail about because he does not like it, that we sh.uld neither jibe nor laugh, but a coachman as is a coachman cannot help it ; they"], [144, "136 RECCI LECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. says we should stand by our bosses' heads as solemn as if it was a funeral. Now, Mr Blunt, what do you think happened this morn ing? I was at a funeral ; there was three mourning coaches and a hearse ; my coach went next the hearse. ' Ah ! who is this going to be buried ? ' said some dandy chap with spectacles. 1 knowed what sort of a cove he was as soon as I seed his spectacles. They are all alike, tho-e spectacles are ; never think small beer of them selves. ' Who is going to be buried ?' says he. \u25a0 I don't know,' says I. ' Is it a man or a woman ?' says he. ' That I don't know,' says I. ' You are a very pretty fellow,' says he ' wearing those 'ere hat bands, and scarfs, and gloves, and a driving those 'ere black bosses, and black harness, and black coaches, all the signs of grief, and not know who you are grieving for.' So I laughs at him outright at his ignorance to think as how I was a grieving. ' I don't know anything about it,' says I ; ' it's a job. It's beef and beer in the kitchen ; hat bands, and scarf, and gloves, and summut for your pocket ; that's all I knows about it, and I should like to have a job like it every day.' There is always such ignorance in these spectacle chaps. They know nothing.\" \" Well, Tom,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" I suppose you are always happy ; happy at a wedding, happy at a christening, aud happy at a funeral.\" \" O, ay ; a coachman is always happy. He has got enough to make him happy, ain't he ? He is as happy as a pig on horseback \u2014 all song and sorrow. He has got his bosses to see to, and his coach. He has got to stand out in all weathers, and has the most to do when there is most rain, and always got to dispute with his fare before he can have what he ought to have ; sometimes he don't take his expenses. Did you ever know a coachee die rich ? No ; but I have known many a one die in the workhus. I don't think a coachee is treated fairly. See what a lot of regulations and taxes you hamper him with ; and you don't let him fix his price, but you fix it for him. Why don't you make the same regulations for the baker, or the butcher, or the grocer ? \" \" Because you are such a set of rogues, and impose upon the public so, Tom.\" \" 0, ay, we impose upon the public, don't we ? they won't let us.

A fare comes to me, and says, ' Tom, I will take you by the hour.' ' Very well,' says I ; ' but you have said that too loud. Did not you see how that bit of blood turned his ears when you said I will take you by the hour ? Well, he did then. Now, when he knows I am engaged by the hour, he won't go above three miles au hour, he won't ; and if I was to flog him to make him go faster, I should have to flog him so much that my arm would ache, and they would be having me up before the beaks for cruelty to animals. So you had better say you will take me by the job loud enough for him to hear ; then I can get him_to go.' And that is true, he knows as well as I do.\" \" Why don't you whip him, and make him? \" said Jack Sprat. \" O, ay, I should whip him : a merciful man is merciful to his beast, he is ; leastwise so says the parson.\" \" He should have been a parson's horse,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" he seems so fond of saying his prayers.\" \" Those knees of his,\" said Tom, \" were broke before I had anything to do with him ; but I can hold him up, I can, and he has got some go in him for all that, he has. I took a party of four to Silhill yesterday ; he did it easy in five minutes under the hour.

When they was a-giviug of parties, they was everybody ; they was very tip top people. Folks used to be offended because they did not get the invite. When they had a feast they was full of friends : but now they are down, they are down ; there is nobody will give them an invite. They say we coachees are selfish and like a stiff glass now and then.

They won't look at him when they see him in the streets even. When he had plenty of wine to give away he had plenty of friends ; when he has got none, he has no friends.

This attention so opened Tom's heart, he got up to make a speech. He stood with his whip in his left hand as a soldier holds his firelock when under inspection, and he waved his mug of fours in his right hand as he addressed the companv. \u25a0 Mr. Blunt, and gentlemen all, I ain't a-ffoing to say as how a ecaehee is perfect, as who on us is r but J am a-going to say this, that he is as good as any one else, and though he be no scollard and can't argify as well as some, he's up to a thing or two, he is ; and knows what he knows in his way, he does. If he ain't had a good schooling in the schools, be has had a good schooling in the world, and I don't see why he should be put upon bv anybody. Now a coachee's customers are, many on um, I should not be wrong if I said most on am, just between being poor and jnst between beiug rich ; they can't afford to keep a coach cf their own, and yet are proud enough to keep two coaches. Well, they want us to ply for nothing, they do. I hey think as how a hoss, and a stab'.e, and a coach, and us, and taxes, and all can be kept for nothing, they do, and that we ought to work for them for nothing, and be satisfied with the honour. They are always disputing with us about the fare ; and then they say it is us who are disputingwith them about the fare: and then they are so sarcastic and so sneerirg. and treat us as somebody as is nobody. Suppose then we don't like it, for a coachee's got pride as wed as the fare, though the fare does think himself somebody, and the coachee don't, that's ail. Why, it's just this 'ere, Mr. Blunt, and gentlemen all, he is se: down for being saucy, when he is only defending himself as a man, and I say a coachee's a man, and has got feelings, he ha3. Yon be civil to a coachee, and a coachee will be chil to vou ; but then if you are so high, and think yourself so nobby, you can't help the coachee saving, ; Lawk, how grand ! ' He will think it if he don't say it. He will think, if he don't say, ' Lawk, how nobby !

Suppose now the coachee smells it, and says, ' What's that, Mum.' They hold it as if it was something as did not smell sweet, and it has got a sort of a musky sort of stink about it. But, if a coachee smells it, and says, * What's that. Mum :' they say, * Ton saucy, impudent fellow, it's your fare.' Juvp.-sed now he gets riled a hit at being thought nobody, and says, * No. Mum ; it looks like a sixpence, and if it's all the money you have got about you too had better keep it ; you may want it to give the fiddler*' That's what it is.

He is one of those bosses as dou't sweat for patronage, he is. I never see such a hoss as him : he is just like a Christian j he only sweats for money, he don't. Then they says I am an uncivil brute, because I won't do the grand for nothing; when all the while it ain't me, it's my hoss. Now if I was to go and ask for such a thing as a ha'porth of finnigig to sweeten my hesse's feed, they wouldn't give it me for nothing.

So old Charley got tipped three bob for that job. Now he was always up to these 'ere tricks, but somehow it did him no good. When he had done a do of this sort, he lost a day iu swaggering about it.

They would laugh at them, but they would not hail him. They would laugh at his do's, but then they would not like to be done, so kept away from him. One day he was hailed to take a party from Busby's to a ball. As he stood at the door waiting, he seed in the hall Miss Charlotte. You know, Mr. Blunt, that her's rather oldish for a Miss. Charley could not rest without being up to some of his gammon, so he says says he, 'Betty, Miss Charlotte is one of the handsomest women in Birmingham, she is.

I thought it hard for a man like him, who had been brought up a gentleman, with an estate of his own, to be reduced to be a coachee. But it was women and wine, and hounds and bosses, that did it. He was brought up well, he was. He did the regular, he did. He lived a fast life ; a short and a merry un. AU verv well while the merry days are on, but not so well when all the money is gone. W hen poverty overtakes a wasted body, aud a ruined constitution ; when there ain't strength enough to work, and life has been spent among rogues and demireps, harpies who never become friends, who never look upon a poor man that thev have ruined but to laugh at him, or if they see him lying in a ditch, as too many of them do, kick him. Mr. Blunt, it is a hard thiDg for a man that is one, that is a born squire too, to know that he has beeu a fool, and spent all he had before he knowed what he was doing. He has got that in his bosom as is always on upbraiding on him, he has. He can't look up, like. He thinks everybody knows what he knows. If he takes a fare he is always melancholy like, and so quiet, sometimes the humblest of the humble. Sometimes a dash of his old pride comes across him, but he can't. Like as the old hunter, when he hears the view hallo, feels the old spirit come again, and starts at the old pace to join in the run, but soon gives it up, he can't, he ain't what he was, it's aU gone out on him.

The moon in all her glory sails through the blue sky, which is undefiled by any cloud or spot of vapour \u2014 a crystal arch \u2014 in which she seems hung, not by clnins visible to human eye, but by that unseen Power which never faints nor tires ; which holds up all the earth on which so many now repose, and the moon which rides in cloudless majesty ; and those lesser lights far away, almost at the boundary of eternity wliich poets say are the pavement of heaven. No breath moves the still air, and the moonlight falls upon the earth \u2014 as it were, to sleep. It was a fancy of the olden times, that in nights like thio there were ears enraptured by the harmony of the spheres : so gifted were they that the celestial music to wliich all created things move was audible to them as the song of angels, who for ever sing their hallelujahs far, far away in yon distant sky ; so far away that all animated things have to sink in repose, the winds retire, and stillness, serene stillness, falls everywhere around; then come those sweet sounds, like the harmony of far-away bells, to which vou have to listen before you can hear ; and those sweet sounds, in tbe fancy of the past, were called the music of the spheres. But it is not all fancy. Listen to the voice with which nature speaks to you, and read her teachings, and there is no music which ever rolled from the pealing organ, or the midnight song of many voices, so witching as that. If man ever gets a foretaste of heaven, it is in nights like this, when he drinks in its loveliness and beauty, and bows his head before its everlasting glory. There are dullards who hear not the song, but it is not for them there is harmony in heaven. How sweet is the night ! It is in nights like this that th ughts are gen-"], [156, "148 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. dered in the soul of man which live through all ages ; it is in nights like this that man communes best with his Maker, and better understands the everlasting truths he is taught. It was in a night like this that Homer looked down upon the hosts of Troy, and, fired with the beauty of the scene, sang that song of Helen and of Troy, which is for us and for all time. It was in nights like this that the poets of the past imagined each glade filled with elfin people, dancing to a merry roundelay. If these fond fancies were the personification of thoughts \u2014 for the old world made every idea into a person or a tangible figure \u2014 the glade, and all the scene on which the moon now streams in pats of pattering light, are full of fairies. To the vulgar herd they are moon struck fancies ; for to them nature doth not show ber secrets, but to those who have an understanding to comprehend them she doth unfold her charms like the veriest wanton. See in tbe vale, as the rippling stream runs over its pebbly bed, how the moonbeams dance like a shower of pattering silver light ; the elms throw their sharp shadows on the grass ; the dewdrops sparkle like precious gems ; and the distant woods repose in solemn grandeur. The heavens seem to have retired, while the earth is pensive with this unmatched beauty. Oh ! how happy is the man who can understand the language of the hour, and commune freely with the sp'rit of the night. It is as if celestial beings came to him to tell him of heavenly glory. Passing along beneath the shadow of the houses were two men, all unconscious of the beauty of the night. They had sat in the Eagle and BaU until they were jolly ; arm-in-arm they waddled, leaning upon each other for support. \" I say,\" said one of them, \" he is a jolly fellow ; and we have had a jolly night. He can do it, he can. There is not such a jolly fellow as him in the kingdom. Ha, ha, ha ! what funny tales he told. Now I say it is a pleasure to be in his company ; a treat it is. A man forgets his troubles. He is a jolly fellow, he is. Such a man for business too. He is a deep die, he is. He knows a thing or two, he does. I have heard him argify with a parson, and he is deep enough to do a lawyer, he is.

I would scorn the action. \u25a0 shall be a gt-nius, or I will never be such a fool as to get one. There are some men so foolish as to think that good strong common sense is tbe best guide and counsellor. That's very foolish ; very foolish indeed ; it's law. Some men think that to tell the truth is all that should be done in a court of justice : ttat's more fooiisher still. It is not what's true, it's \u25a0hat's evidence. What's evidence, Mr. Twittles, what's it natter about its being true, it it is not evidence ! It does not matter if it is not common sense if it's evidence.

Ton want to iTtrwi 4 him, and what is more, you want to knock hir and you might not be able to do that by telling the truth, but you can by evidence. It's a noble thing to know some law. When I first went into a court of justice, I saw a man with a little book in Us band, saying his prayers to a lot of men in a box. Oh ! says L, we shall base justice done here ; they say their prayers to begin with, aad Til be bound that man with a big wig will preach them a sermon. He did preach them a and a very good one too, only I thought there was a bit of the old woman in it. Then they called a man in aad put him in a box higher than the others, and began to say prayers to him. I put my face into my bat and looked at the lion and unicorn, and said my prayers to them, as I do every Sunday when I go into the bouse of the Lord. But what a fool I was ; they was not saying prayers ; :__.- zr-r-z -.-z \"\";-'- \"- m :-.-.-- _ _ \u2014 _. v -_--_ \u25a0 -- ::- tend, they don't. They are lawyers and counsellors, and judges aad policemen. They never say prayers \u2014 what's the use ? they know whose they are and what will become of them, and it is not prayers as wid alter their destiny. Well, they wasn't saying prarers : they was onlv swearing in the jury and the witness, teflmg him he must tell' the truth \"and the whole truth- When he began to teU the truth they would not let him ; they said it was not evidence. There the poor fellow stood, and did not know what to do. He had sworn to tell the truth, and they would not let him ; be had put his soul into jeopardy, and they would not let him get it out. ' Come,' said the big wig, ' you must answer that gentleman.' But the witness began to talk about his oath and his soul, but the big wig said, 'Pooh, pooh!

When you find him out you get the money off him, and make the poor devil almost break his heart. Serve him right \u2014 damn him ; why is he poor ? What h ive you got under your arm ?\" \" They are some drafts that are wanted in a hurry, and I have been working at them late ; they have to be engrossed, signed, sealed, and delivered the day after to-morrow,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" What are they, Mr. Twittles?\" said Mr. Blunt. \" Secrets of the office,\" replied Mr. Twittles. \" Let us look at them, then ; let us see what sort of writing yours is. I never had the pleasure of looking at your writing ; you write a nice round hand, you do, I dare say. Mr. Twittles, do all the lawyers' clerks go to the same school to learn to write ? \" \" Go to the same school to learn to write ! \u2014 No. Why, Mr. Blunt, do you ask that question ?\" \" Because, you see, they all write alike, just as if they had been taught iu the same school. Lord bless you, Mr. Twittles, if you get a postman's wallet and sort all the letters out, you can tell every lawyer's letter in it, and not miss one ; they are all of them of the same family \u2014 a bold round hand, and all of them blue paper. I know what the paper is ; it's blue ruin \u2014 but why do they all write alike ?\" Mr. Twittles was posed at the question, so Mr. Blunt explained it in his own way. \" I know,\" said he, \"it's precedent; there is nothing in law without a precedent, and there is no roguery in life but stops the law if it can find a precedent.

Finding that he could not do it, he screwed up his eye with a Knowing wink to Jack Sprat, and pointed at the papers. He then spread out his arms and brought them together again, as if he were embracing some one.

The slightest alarm creates a panic, and men iu panic are always un reasonable.

If every one would set his face against men like him, the race would soon go out ; but as men will let everything give way to the desire of gain, they do but encourage each other in this selfishness.\" \" Yes, yes,\" said my father, \" we must look at life as it is, and not as we would desire it to be.

Shall we therefore say that the sun is a sycophant, passing his time, hypocrite-like, in reflecting the tone of whatever he shines upon, and never the brilliancy of his own light. The way of the world we must submit to as long as we are in the world. The conduct you complain of is not pe culiar to tradesmen ; to think so is to take a very narrow view of life. Kings, whom you would suppose to be the least influenced by motives which influence other men, do the same thing : they associate with, as far as kings associate at all, kings whom in their hearts they utterly despise. 1 hey send flattering presents to each other, and address to each other honeyed phrases, which one uses because he thinks the other expects to hear them, and which the other aliects to believe because he thinks he is expected to believe them Men high in the world, who seem so sensitive of their honour that they resent even the shadow of a stain, associate and deal with men wdiom in their hearts they despise. The politician will follow any crooked course which leads to where his ambition aspires ; the divine is not called to a sphere of usefulness where the pay is less than that which he already obtains ; the conduct of the tradesman is not peculiar, but is like that of all other men. What the world calls the meanness and the littleness of life grovels in the palace, perhaps more abjectly even than in the mart. The worm will eat its way into the splendour of the wealthy as well as the tressel of the poor ; the poison that embitters and envenoms life, treads in gilded halls with the same crouching step as it creeps into the homes of the lowly. It is a false inference which says that there is more of what is called high-suuled honour in one rank of life than another ; it may seem so, where wealth hides the ridicule of unbounded pretension, but it is only seeming : the peacock with all its gorgeous plumage, has a mean and unsatisfied maw. Quarrels and low desires are found in the aerie of the eaiile as well as in the nest of the sparrow ; aud the patrician's home, or rather his palace, shelters as much, if not more, meanness as does the clay biggin upon the wild moor.\" \"Ah ! \" said my mother, '\u25a0 that is all very well, I dare say, to those who understand it ; but I have no patience"], [164, "156 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. with such nonsense.

It has been said that God made the blue-bell, and man has given it the gorgeous splendour of the hyacinth. It has been said that God made the crab and man the apple. It is a proud doctrine to preach, and no doubt the preacher, swelling with the importance of this discovery, thinks himself as much superior to God as the plum is to the sloe, the apple to the crab, the hyacinth to the blue-bell, and the Ge'ant de Bataille to the wild rose which blooms on the moor. But as well might he say that God made the sprat, and man the whale; that God made the pony and man the horse ; tbat God made the hawk, and man the eagle ; that God made the little star, whose twinkling we can just discern, and man that planet which shines with such splendour when the old man says his vesper prayers, aud thinks of that blessed world to which he may soon be called, and young hearts stroll where the hawthorn blooms in scented sweetness, to dream of the happiness and felicity which are to be theirs in the world in which we live.

W7hat are the powers of omnipotence, whose potency he can wield better than Omnipotence can ? It is but the vanity of a poor inexperienced worm, who is permitted to stand before the temple in which are mighty mysteries, having seen the shadow of some, believes himself master of all. Let him reduce his boasted knowledge to practice, and put his power to the test of experiment; let him take the material wliich nature uses, and do her work ; let him go to the dung-heap, and make a blade of grass ; if he should so far succeed as to make the deadly night shade, even his failure will show his knowledge ; but if of tbe dung-heap he makes nothing but the dung-heap, let him surrender his pretensions, and yield before mysteries over which, in his pride, he thought he had obtained the mastery. Mr. Mincher came into the warehouse with a posy of such beautiful flowers, which, if the theory of cultivation were true, the gardener might present with pride as his masterpiece. They were not only fine in themselves, but were selected and arranged with the greatest skill. It was a bribe for my mother. As soon as she saw them it was quite obvious the bribe was successful. What ever she might think of Mr. Mincher, she thought highly of them, and was proud in having them to ornament her parlour. My mother was as an April day. When the sun shone, she was all brightness and joy ; when the clouds lowered, she was all gloom and sadness. Mr. Mincher gave them to my mother, aud she received them with many thanks ; but I could see there was a little of the leaven of her old dislikes to the giver, which would not require much to work it up into the old fermentation. Mr. Mincher apologised for being later than he expected by saying that he had heard of a large pro perty which was about to be sold, and he had been to look at it. He had been detained much longer than he had expected, for he had serious thoughts of buying it. Had it been on sale by private contract he would have made an offer for it. He would willingly give eight thousands ; but it was to be sold by public auction, and upon second thoughts he intended to invest his money in ground rents. If the interest were not so good, the security was better. If my father knew of any improving ground rents for sale, he would be glad to be informed of them. \" All"], [171, "163 LECTURING. kinds of property,\" continued he, \" give trouble, but ground rents the least, at any rate in the income. It is true you cannot always realise, and you may have great trouble if you want to do so suddenly, or your executor may have ; but then they are so secure. If the interest be small, the security is great and undeniable.\" Upon my youthful simplicity this had the effect inteuded by Mr. Mincher it should have upon all of us; but my experience of life has told me that it is one of the arts men like him use to counteract what they know to be sus picious in their own fortunes. They are always about to buy property or invest in ground rents ; always trying to give people a notion of great wealth. If they cannot pay their accounts as freely as is consistent with such a reputation, the answer is, \" I have just been investing a few thousands in ground rents, and it has made me rather tight iu the till. I must give you a bill this time. I ought not to have done it to the extent I have ; but the temptation, Sir, the temptation was too much for me. People who have ground rents to sell know my weakness, and they are continually tempting me. It is wrong of me to be so tempted ; but I cannot always resist.\" These are the men who, when bankruptcy comes upon them, fail for large amounts, and whose creditors are savagely bitter against them. They have trusted them on the representation of great wealth, and they find they have not only lost their money, but have been overreached in the game of life \u2014 have been the victims of the commonest arts \u2014 and that shrewdness of which they had been proud has received a shock. Their bitterness is caused quite as much by the consciousness that their own deep game has been lost by their own depth, as by the amount of which they have been, as they say, \" cheated ;\" but such it i3, has been, and ever will be. The boaster will find some one to believe his boastings, and thereby obtain some measure of success, and will seem to leap into the seat of fortune with a sudden bound. Mr. Mincher made his selection from our stock, and then desired my father to draw upon him for the amount. \" Suppose,\" said my father, \" I send for gold to the amount you have selected ; it will suit my purpose as well, or better, than a bill, and will be as one to you \" \" Very well,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" do so.\" During the whole of this time my mother kept fidgeting in and"], [172, "164 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN out of the warehouse without any apparent object. As a horse, full of youth and the pasture, when mounted by his rider is with difficulty restrained from bounding off in his own wild way, bidding defiance to time aud space, and tearing along the road, a being of courage and of pride, so my mother had to curb the inclination she felt to give a few words upon the view she took of things, for Mr. Mincher's especial edification ; but, after caracoling awhile, proudly as the high-mettled racer, she did restrain herself so far as to give no outward cause for offence. Nevertheless, Mr. Mincher's quick eye saw it all, and, with what some people call gentlemanly and high-bred con sideration, but really with craft and subtilty, he did his best to remove the impression he saw was against him. As he left, he shook hands with my father in the old hearty manner, and with my mother with the same respectful familiarity he formerly did. With me he was kind, and apparently confiding, as if, there being no craft in youth, it was unnecessary to use it towards him, unless it were the craft of seeming open and generous. As he left the warehouse, he raised his hat to my mother, and made a profound bow, as I thought, too profound for sincerity or respect. Some men can judge by the tone of words, better than by the words themselves, whether the sentiments those words convey are genuine, or are but like the false lights of the wreckers, intended to lure and betray. Nature and truth will break through the blandest manner, and show, even among the most subtle refinements of the knave, a signal of themselves. As he shook hands with me, I thought his hand left mine too soon, and that it was straightened too much, as if he had gone through a form which was intended to deceive, and not as an expression of hearty companionship. \" Well,\" said my mother, \" he has gone, and good shut, I say. I cannot get rid of the dislike I have formed. It will be a long time before I shall be right with that man. He brought me a nice posy of flowers. They are a nice posy of flowers as ever I saw. I say it is a blessing ; and yet it is what I cannot understand, that flowers should bloom as well, and sometimes better, for a rogue than for an honest man.\" \" My dear,\" said my father, \" do you think flowers have any idea for whom they bloom ? They unfold their own sweet colours and their own sweet forms"], [173, "165 LECTURING. under the influence of the seasons, and of the genial heat of the sun, without a thought as to who sees them bloom. They are heedless whether any human eye witness their beauty or not. Like genuine goodness, they bloom and shed abroad the influence of their beautv, not that they may receive the admiration, but that they may administer to the comfort and enjoyment of man.\" \" Ah ! \" said my mother, \" you have always something very fine to preach about. You find a reason for everything, and an old fashioned conceit as well. I did not like Mr. Mincher coming here, and now he has been, I do not like it. I have a sort of seeling, which I cannot explain, that all is not right. I hope he will not be coming here, as he had used to come. I shall have to ease my mind, I am sure. I feel I shall be no better to that man until I have eased it. There is something wrong about him, I am sure there is. I should like to know why it is, that when a woman takes a thorough dislike to a man, that she is always right ; for let me say this, that it is a woman's place and nature to be fond of a man, just as much as it is a man's place and nature to be fond of a woman. Man may dislike man, and woman may dislike woman, and be nothing particularly wrong in it either way ; but if man dislikes woman, or woman dislikes man, there must be something wrong \u2014 something deficient in their natures, or some instinctive feeling, I think you call it, wbich says they must be avoided. Just see what a poor creature woman is ; she is sent helpless into the world, a weaker vessel than man, having nature's sorrows to bear. She cannot mix with the world with the same robustness that man can ; yet the burden and pain of the future generation is thrown upon her. Her temperament is so excitable, that the game of life cannot be played by her with that coolness which is necessary to success. The wide world is not as much open for her to choose in as it is for man. She must on all occasions look to man for support and protection. If then she takes a dislike to a man, it is against nature, against her instincts, and against her interest. Therefore if she conceive a dislike to a man, she must, ought, and should avoid him.\" \" Well,\" said my father, \" there may be truth in what you say. There is a secret voice in all God's creatures, which men call instinct, and which is sometimes in opposition to that reason which is given to man for his especial guide.

CHAPTER XXVII. SHOPPING. Have you stood upon the railway platform when the express train went roaring by, and thought what destruction and havoc would crash around should any one attempt to stop its onward course ? Have you seen the avalanche rush down the eternal Alps and carry away the works of man in utter ruin, and thought of its mighty power ? Have you stood upon the rocks which boldly rear their heads and frown upon the ocean as it lashes their base, and thought how irresistible must be the power which lifts the ocean tides and hurls their waves upon the land, or dashes them iu anger against the rocks on which you stood ? Have you stood upon the battle-field, in reality or in fancy, where man meets his brother man in rage, and heard the roar of his cannon or the thrilling of his gun as it leaps from his serried ranks like the lightning's flash from the bosom of the scowling cloud, and thought what power men, when combined and in anger, can wield ? Have you heard the storm roar among the mountains, or seen the wild torrent tumble from crag to crag as if in sullen rage, or rush and roll along the lowlands in one raging flood, carrying away the works of man as if they were nought, and thought of the omnipotence of the flood ? All these mighty manifestations of power you think irresistible, and will accomplish anything. But how is it accomplished ? By ruin and destruction. The railway train is hurled in havoc, and is crushed amid groans and death. The avalanche rushes down the Alps with a mighty roar ; there is one despairing shriek from the shieling of man, then all returns to the silence of solitude. The ocean comes rolling on with a sullen roar, and if the bark of man rides in defiance it is dashed against the rocks and scattered in many fragments. On the"], [177, "SHOPPING. 169 battle-field there are shrieks and groans and the cry of victory ; death grapples in rage on that field of murder- \u2014 yes, of murder ; though man with high-sounding phrases calls it the field of glory. In the mountain storm the lightning strikes, and the stricken is dead ; the flood rolls along, and the works of man are in ruins. W hen nature or man is in rage the result is ruin, and nothing more. But there is a power which blesses man with its mild and gentle sway, which fills his meads with plenty, and stores his garners with profusion ; which falls upon the earth with au angel's tread, so still and so genial, the thoughtless are insensible of being in its presence It streams with one full flood, and fills the valleys with fatness. The swain rejoices with his shepherd's pipe, and sings his sylvan song of joy and gladness. The mai den decorates her hair with garlands and dances with all the happiness of innocence and youth. Man and his flocks are glad, and the earth is clothed with beauty. It is the light and heat of the ever-blessed sun. It comes with a velocity so great that that of the railway train and the cannon ball is as nothing. Yet it does not bruise the butterfly's wing. Its power is greater than that of the surge of all the oceans ; yet it does not make the thread of the gossamer tremble. The speed of the lightning which darts from the thunder-cloud, and strikes the earth ere we can point out its place, is absolutely nothing in comparison. Yet the little child, which plays upon the flowery bank, laughs and crows in the full glare of its power. The rush of the avalanche is less than nothing, yet the pearly drop of dew wliich hangs trembling on the harebell is undisturbed ; the faintest zephyr's breath will dislodge that dew-drop, yet this power which comes with the mighty rush of millions of miles in a minute \u2014 a speed which man has not the faculty to conceive \u2014 strikes the dew-drop and lets it hang pendent still. Whenever it comes there is beauty and song ; the flowers are gay ; the birds are happy ; the tiny insects dance with joy ; the meads are full of plenty ; man rejoices, and everything which lives, lives with delight, its power is so gentle and genial ; its voice is the voice of a seraph, and its spirit the spirit of cheerfulness and love. Man would not commit the sin of idolatry if he said its spirit was the spirit of God. Descending from great to less, these two classes of power have their representatives in the conduct of man, and with the same"], [178, "170 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. effect. Some men attempt to accomplish their ends by force and violence. They know no other way ; there is resistance, and the usual consequence ; their home is turbulent and unhappy \u2014 a place of bickerings, of strife, and of storms. Others take the sun as their model, and there is contentment and love ; a silent joy, as happy as the happiest summer's day ; a home which man is ever loth to leave, and to which he is ever fond to return. Now, this was my father's way. He did by kindness what others attempted by force and failed. \" My dear,\" said my father, \" I have got a few hours to spare, and I will take you a walk down the town.\" Now, all that I ever understood the expression \" down the town\" to mean, was down New Street, along High Street, and up Bull Street ; and though I have enquired from all the antiquarians with whom I have ever come in contact why those streets were called \" the town,\" I have never been able to receive a satisfactory reply. Those learned men could not tell. They supposed that tradition has dubbed them the \" town\" from a very high antiquity, when those streets were \"the town;\" but I must confess that the old maps and records of Birmingham which I have had the pleasure of consulting do not confirm the supposi tion. When I was a very young man I consulted one of those lovers of the olden times upon this very question. He said that in his time there was a gateway at the end of New Street where it joins High Street, and that the entrances from Spiceal Street and Digbeth were very narrow ; that at the Welsh Cross and Bull Lane were also narrow entrances \u2014 all capable of defence against an enemy ; and that he had no doubt they were the military outworks of Birmingham, and that Birmingham was once confined to those streets. I regret to say that my enquiries, though they confirm some of these statements, ignore the notion that those streets were once all of Birmingham. I remember on one occasion recalling a gentleman's recollection who had \" got up in the world \" to the character of a man who was once his in timate companion and friend before wealth made him proud. His answer was, \" I had used to know him, but I do not now.\" So, if Birmingham was ever confined to the narrow limits which we call \" the town,\" we should say, \" We used to know it ; we have got up in the world now, and do not want to be told from what we sprang, nor for our memory to be recalled to the poor"], [179, "171 SHOPPING. people who were once our peers.\" Be this how it may, my father told my mother he had a few hours to spare, and he would take her down the town. My mother did not require to be told twice. She bad no paius neither in her back nor her side, nor her legs ; no headache ; if she had, a walk down the town with my father would have cured it better than the best medicine the druggist's shop contains. It is wonderful how much it will cure ; there is no medicine that can do what that can \u2014 especially if you should buy your wife a new dress when there. Try it, and there is no knowing what will happen. I have known people who looked as if they would go to the grave childless ; I have seen them take their wives down \" the town,\" and after that there was no need for them to utter any lamentations at not having families. It is wonderful what it will do. Let me advise you to try it ; you will never regret it. When you buy the dress, be sure you are not stingy. My mother dressed herself up in the richest apparel she had. She came trotting down stairs full dressed, her face flushed and blooming with delight, and wearing an expression which said plainer than words, \" John, don't I look handsome? \" I, seeing my mother's humour, said, \" Where are you going, mother ? \" She threw her head back with a proud toss, aud said quite loftily, \" Down the town with your father, to be sure.\" She pulled on her gloves, smoothing out every wrinkle from the fingers. She took my father's arm, and marched by his side quite proudly. When he put down his right foot she put down hers, and though he, seeing her spirit, made his stride more manly, she faltered not ; it was tread for tread. She did it so proudly. She nodded her head aud waggled her petticoats, and looked scornfully at the poor as they brushed by. When thev got into New street, my mother said to my father, \" Is that Mrs. Mincher on the other side ? Don't seem to look ; but is it?\" \" Yes, it is,\" said my father; \"we will speak \" \" No, no,\" said she ; \" let us march by,\" and she walked as majestically as does Queen Catherine in the play. She did do it. Mrs. Mincher saw her and moved to my mother. She returned the salute with such a profound courtesy, just as if she were a duchess saluting a countess. She felt that she must not speak in her ordinary manner, but that there must be an affectation and a foppery in her language which, as she said,"], [180, "172 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" is so ladylike and becoming.\" \" Oh,\" said my father, \" speak in your ordinary way. It is not affectation which makes a lady, It may be foppish, but not ladylike. Minds that are fribblish may thiuk so, but womanly minds have more sense.\" \" Have I not heard you say many a time,\" she replied, \" that it is manners which make the lady? I would like to know if my manners, now I am walking beside you, are not ladylike ? \" Aa she said so, she gave such a strutting swagger. \" I would also like to know if the manner of my speech is not ladylike. If not, I will take some lessons of a dancing master in manners and deportment, then nobody can say but that I am ladylike.\" \" And be the manufactured article such men turn out \u2014 artificial and unreal,\" said my father. \" I would rather see a woman act and speak according to the dictates of her own heart. Then she will never be wrong. It is when she becomes unnatural that she is unreal. 'Ihe manners which make a lady are the outward mani- festations of a kind and womanly heart, and not the set forms and affectations which some believe. They are the mere fashions of the hour, but those thoughts and actions which make the lady are above all fashions. If they are not in the heart, no fashion can ever place them there.\" \" Ah,\" said my mother, \" I dare say that is all very well in its place \u2014 that is on a Sunday, when we are at church ; but we are in the town now. Look here, what a love of a bonnet there is here ; how very beautifully and tastily it is got up. How very handsomely it is trimmed. You cannot say but that is a ladylike article of dress. Do look at it ; is it not beautiful ? I declare it is suitable for a queen. If I were to go to church next Sunday in that bonnel all the ladie3 in Birmingham would he jealous, and envy me the possession of such a duck. Now, do look at it.\" \" Yes,\" said my father, \" it is beautiful ; but if you were to go to church in that bonnet next Sunday you would be a great sinner.\" \" A great sinner,\" said my mother, with surprise ; \" why ?\" \" The ladies go to church to worship their God,\" said my father ; \" instead of which they would be worshipping your bonnet, and you know it is a great sin to bow down to idols.\" \" V\\ ell,\" said my mother, \" I would not mind them being sinners if I had the bonnet.\" When she was satisfied with looking at it, they walked on until they came to the \" first draper's shop in"], [181, "173 SUOPIMNO the town.\" \" My dear,\" said my lather, \" will you walk iuto this shop.\" My molher did not object to be \" my denied\" when she had to go into a draper's shea She said there was some- Iking delightful iu shopping. 11 there were one ladylike ueeoni plishnient she more delighted in limn another, it was going a shopping.

Into the shop they went, aud my father desired the shopman, or, as he called him, the \"couutcrskippcr,\" lo bring him a silk dress lor my mother to look at The eounterskipper leaned with one <slbovv upon the counter, rubbing his hands together quietly, and holding his head ou one side in n manner he thought the acme of civility, and with the greatest volubility ran through a number of names of ditl'en ut kinds of silk, ill both dead and glace, plain aud brocaded, iu train and organ/due, and of so many names and colours, that both my father aud mother were bewildered. My father afterwards said, \" lli.it fellow told us of more kinds aud colours and names of silk than I believe he had iu the shop.\" \"Oh dear.no'\" said my mother. \u2022\u2022Gentlemen are satisfied with a few kinds oi cloth for their clothing . they have not the taste that l.iou-s have.

He selected one of them, nnd showed it to my mother. lie said, \" It was the most lady like robe they had iu the shop . .in entirely new colour, anil au entirely new material.

' Seeing my mother bewildered by the riches she had before her, and more than once asking my father s opinion without receiving n satisfactory reply, he went to the further end of the shop ; he called the principal to unlock n glass case, and he brought from there a very handsome brocaded silk, and unrolled it before my mother. \" Now,\" said he, in a confidential whisper, \" we do not show this article to ladies in general ; we are exceedingly choice with it. There has been but one dress sold, nnd that, Ma'am, was sold to the Countess of Bradford. She is a lady of the most exquisite taste, and those we sell to the aristocracy we are very careful to whom we offer ; very careful indeed, 1 can assure you.\" My mother put the others on one side, and devoted the whole of her attention to \"the Countess of Bradford's pattern, \" as my father always called it. That was the dress my father bought my mother. I was surprised at her choice, because I had often heard her speak slightingly of the aristocracy ; but there are worse people than my mother was. I have heard some speak with bitterness of the aristocracy, who would be proud to ride in an aristocratic carriage, dine in an aristocratic hall, and dress themselves in aristocratic clothing. Indeed, I have known some people pride themselves because they knew the butler to nn aristo crat, and some who have even prided themselves upon having once patted his dog, and read the name engraved upon his brass collar. The dress was sent home. As my mother walked home again with my father, she took a lurching and a sweeping step. She batted her eyes with dignity and pride. Her face wore an expression of superlative greatness and happiness ; she was so lofty; she kept looking at the tops of the houses; she noddled her head and waggled her petticoats more than ever ; in her estimation my father was the greatest man in the world, nnd was it not an honour and a happiness to have him for a husband ?

Some women, when they have a new dress, stow it away in their drawers, and when a lady friend drops in to take a cup of tea with them \u2014 and it is astonishing how many ladies do drop in when there is a new dress in the drawers \u2014 take their opinion as to how, \" if you were me, you would have it made up ? In what way do you think it would most become me?\" In taking various opinions \u2014 for no two minds agree in the fashion of a dress or any other matter \" where a superior and refined taste is re quired \" \u2014 they get to know a many ways of doing the same thing, and have time to make a deliberate and certain choice, and have not afterwards to regret \" I wish I had seen your dress before I had mine made up.

This arises even from an ordinary dress ; but how much more delicious must have been my mother's delight the first time she went to church in the Countess of Bradford's pattern. 0, Ma'am, it was a heavenly sensation ! But though other ladies may play with their happiness in this way, my mother"], [185, "DRKSSMAKlNi, 177 had her dress made up at once. She worried my father to know in what style he would like to see her dressed. \" O,\" said he, \" please yoursell. and you will please me.\" \" I never saw such a man as vou arc,\" she replied. \" As you have been so kind as to make me a present of that dress, surely you will tell me how you would like it made up.

I have been trying to get my foolish husband to say how he would like my dress made up ; but he wants to leave it all to me, the foolish man. ' O, you need not seem shocked at me calling my husband foolish ; he has a great deal of learning, and knows a great deal of the world, and he is never offended at me for telling the truth. Are you now ? She put her hand to my father's chin and looked at him with her most enticing smile. \" Ah,\" said she, wiih a sigh, \"you would have been a poor creature if you had not met with me. It was the rolling pin that made a man of you, and I am bound to confess a happy woman of me. Now, you know it was the rolling pin.\" \" After that,\" said my father, I will go up into the warehouse.\" \" Won't you say before you go, how I shall have this made?\" \" Have it made your own way.\" \" There now,\" said my mother, \" that is always your way. I should like to please you, but you won't let me. Do you know, Miss Stichem, there never was such a kind good husband as mine. I have heard people say that there is but one good woman in the world, and every fool thinks he has her ; but I am sure there is but one good man in the world, and that is mine, I think I should also say. And my John ! Do you know, he is a most sensible boy ; he can do business like his father, if not better ; he is a credit to us ; so steady, so good, so kind, aud so very clever. Do you know, there is nothing he undertakes to do but he does it so well. It is one of the greatest pleasures I have to know that I have got such a son. He is just like me. When he gets older, I am sure of this \u2014 he will be a great man. I should not be at all surprised, but that not only Birmingham will proclaim his fame, but all the world too. Ah ! dear me ; I feel that I shall not live to see it. The dear good boy, he is so fond of his mother. What a blessing it would be to me if I could live long enough to see the full blaze of his fame ; I could then die happy. When I was a young woman, Miss Stichem, I was very handsome ; everybody said so. I had used to c'ress with very great care, and very great taste. You know, if you be ever so handsome, dress adds very much toyour beauty. As a rule, I think it very silly in young unmarried ladies to allow the gentle men to see them undressed.

Did you ever see my portrait as I was when I was a young woman ?\" \" I have not,\" said Miss Stichem. \" Dear me,\" said my mother, \"then I will show it you,\" and she went to her casket and brought out the miniature, as she was when she was young. \" It is very handsome, and pretty too,\" said Miss Stichem ; \" you are very much like it now.\" \" Do you think so ?\" said my mother. \" I am in my dishabille now, and dress makes such a difference.\" \" Yes, it does,\" said Miss Stichem ; \" but still you can see this is a likeness of what, you were once \u2014 any one could tell this was you ; it is so very pretty, and so very handsome.\" \"Yes, Miss Stichem, when I was young the gentle- men used to admire me very much. I could not go anywhere but they yvere always staring at me and following me. But they do not appear to be so gallant now. I do not see them have that admiration for any woman as they had for me. There were several young men left the town because I frowned upou them. I was not like the young women are now \u2014 glad lo say yes to any man. I said no to a great many before I said yes to one, and I am very happy that I did. Young women should not make themselves so cheap. Did I ever show you my wedding dress?\" \"You did not,\" said Miss Stichem. \" Oh, then you will be delighted to see it; I have kept it very carefully.\" \"In hopes,\" said Miss Stichem, \"that you may want it again.\" \"O, fie, Miss Stichem, how could you think of such a thing ? I do flatter myself, though, that if I were a widow I should have another offer; yet it is very cruel in you to suggest such a thing. 'I hat was my wedding dress. The fashions have changed since then ; but was not it handsome ? I had always a fine head of hair. I had orange blossom in my hair, and I had this lace veil fastened to my back comb and hanging down my back.

I was so happy because I looked so charming, surrounded by my six bridesmaids. *' Had you six bridesmaids, Ma'am?\" \"O yes, six bridesmaids, all dressed alike. It looks so elegant to have six bridesmaids, all beauties. I can assure you it was a great pleasure, Miss Stichem. Let me advise you, when your turn comes Ah ! there now, you need not blush.

When is my John mistaken ! But never mind, Miss Stichem, I shall not blame you ; it is what all young women like. I should not like to be blamed myself. Blame ! there is uo blame about it ; it is natural. But let me advise you, when your turn comes, to have six bridesmaids as I did. It makes such a beautiful procession. It is a delight to you, and a plea sure to all spectators. Now we women are together we can speak our own minds, and I can assure you, Miss Stichem, that there is no sight in this world so charming as a splendid yvedding. A coronation ! Pshaw ! a coronation indeed ; why only one woman can hope to indulge iu that, and a wedding we all have in our turns. 0 it is a delightful sensation to be married ! The gentlemen do not seem to care so much about it ; and indeed, between you and I, if it were not the fashion to have gentlemen at a wedding, I think we could do very well without them, for if yve give the rein to our feelings as we ought to do to thoroughly enjoy it, the gentlemen laugh at us so.\" \" A wedding without a gentleman 1\" exclaimed Miss Stichem, \"I never heard tell of such a thing; how could it be?\" \" Oh,\" said my mother, \" it would be easy enough ; they could come in afterwards and do all they have to do in the vestry \u2014 sign the book, that is all they are wauted for. How delightf'ut it would be to have a wedding without the gentlemen. I wish I were high enough in the world to give it the fashion, I would do it. I would be married two or three times over, for it is such a heavenly sensation. Now, Miss Stichem, my husband has made me a present of this dress ; is it not handsome ?\" \" Indeed it is, and expensive too. I have not seen so rich a dress for many years.

Do you know, I was standing in St. Philip's Churchyard, seeing the ladies come out of the church from the musical festival. I was in the walk which leads from the church to the hotel, and I saw the Countess of Bradford in that very dress. Oh, it was splendid ! She is a charming ladv, and a very great beauty. As she walked down the walk, with a grace all her own, she looked most elegant. What for beauty and dress, she was the belle of the festival. She is a most handsome lady, and dressed as she was in that most beautiful dress, she looked like \u2014 hke, what shall T say : \u2014 bke an angel ; bnt instead of having a trumpet in her hand she had a bouquet of flowers, with a bouquet-holder shaped like a trumpet. She stepped with such a grace ; and the tout ensemble was delightful.\" \" lhe what, Miss Stichem?\" \" The tout ensemble.\" \"And pray what may that mean?\" \"The altogether, Ma'am.\" \"Oh, she was altogether, was she?\" Well, I do not like to see tbe ladies altogether, except iu private. I like to see them in public when they are not in that way ; but I suppose she could not help it, and if there was any one to blame, it must have been the earl.\" \" Oh, dear !\" said Miss Stichem, \"you mistake me; I mean the dress, the trimmings, and the et ceteras were charming, perfectly charming.\" \" Do you think you could make mine up in the same style.\" \"I do; and the countess, being something of your figure, I am sure it will be the most suitable way you can have it made up ; it will be most elegant. The countess is just your figure.\" My mother walked across the parlour with her proud walk, and drawing herself up to her full height, viewed herself in the glass. \" You say the countess is a very handsome lady,\" said my mother, \" and some thing of my figure.\" \" Very much indeed of your figure.\" \" I think,\" said my mother, \" the aristocracy are not so bad as they are represented, especially if they are like me. You shall make my dress up in that style.\" bo it was arranged to have her dress made up like the Countess of Bradford's. She was so charming and so good a lady, that all ought to take pattern by her. On the following Sunday my mother dressed herself in the Countess of Bradford's dress, and came into the parlour prepared for church. I must confess that I was struck by my mother's ele gance. She marched with a stately grace across the parlour ; and I am sure, though I never saw that proud patrician assembly,"], [190, "182 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. that no lady at the Queen's drawing room, where all try to outvie each other in dignity and grace, and are exceedingly jealous of the precedency of each other, could carry herself with a more dignified carriage than my mother did. She had been very par ticular in her enquiries as to the deportment of the countess, and she did the imitation to perfection. She put her right arm through my left, and her left through my father's right, and thus we three went to church, taking up the whole of the fjotpath, and giving way to nobody. My mother did not speak ; but she was so happy. She looked from one lady to another, and saw them burning with envy and jealousy, or thought she did, which to her was just as well as if they did, it was equally delightful. To talk of patrician pride and grace \u2014 it was nothing to my mother's. She had my father on one side, and me on the other. She had on her new silk dress, yvhich all the ladies envied, and she was happy. 0, Ma'am, it was a heavenly sensation ! She was so proud of her dress, she wanted the whole pew to herself, so that she might spread it out without a crease or wrinkle. Tt was the happiest day of her life, not excepting her wedding day. And do not say it was a slight thing that made my mother happy, for if we examine the sources of our happiness or misery with a searching and curious eye they are all slight and trifling. If you are a philosopher, it is very foolish of you to sit down and reason yourself into melancholy and sadness because of the light and airy character of those things which make up human happiness. What is the evening sky which was yesterday covered with such splendid robes of silver and gold ? a scene that is past, and nothing more. What are the happiest hours you ever had, when you were as much untrammelled by troubles as is a little child, and as merry as dawning innocence? only a memory of things past and gone. You have been in a theatre when it was filled by a laughing and a happy crowd, where beauty displays her charms and rich ornaments, where the painter placed his mimic scene before you as naturally as nature's self, where music warbled forth the thoughts of men who had been blessed with geniu=, where words which shadow forth thoughts yvhich are as immortal as man were uttered with the poet's own fervour, and have been happy; but have you been there when the music was silent, when the stage was empty, and the audience gone, and"], [191, "183 DRESSMAKING. thought of the mere tinsel and poor fragility which made up your happiness ? Yet such is life ! If the philosopher dwells too long upon such things he is not wise, but foolish. Yes, such is life. Those who now strut about in tinsel greatness shall pass away, and the scenes in which they were so proud and great be like yesterday's sunset \u2014 a splendour which is gone, a departed memory, or a thing which hath no existence \u2014 a theatre which has lost its audience, and from which the soul which gave it life hath flown.

CHAPTER XXIX. TAKING A WALK. Pray, Sir, have you ever made a speech at a parish meeting, or in the ward to which you belong, or at a town's meeting, or at an election for Members of Parliament? Or if you be one of the great ones of the land, in the senate house, have you delivered your opinions with all the wisdom with which nature has so richly endowed you, as to how your parish, your ward, your town, your nation, or, taking a scope worthy of your abilities, how the world at large ought to be governed ? Have you convinced the several audiences hovv little were the men who at present governed those establishments ? As applause ringing cheer on cheer re-echoed your sentiments when you have sat down, having convinced those assemblies that you were somebody, and indicated something of what you could do if you were permitted, have you felt how little were those who rose to answer you ? Have you wished the laws of debate were not so stringent, so that you could do it again and smash your opponent ; but as it was, have not you turned your back upon them and thought, \" I have done enough ;\" and in stead of waiting to listen to the reply, have gone to take an ice ? Have you seen your speech in the papers and burned to correct the many mistakes the reporters had made, and felt indignant that they had not done you more justice? Have you felt that you yvere, or ought to have been, the one man of your day ? As you passed along the streets of your city and knew that every one was looking at you and saying to themselves, \" That is the great man who made that splendid speech,\" did you not experience an exquisite pleasure ? I do not want you to make the confession to me, you might make the confession to your wife ; that is usual \u2014 you can strut, cock your tail, and swell there, and the world"], [193, "185 taking a walk. not know of your little weakness. That is usual, we will say uothing about that. But now, did you not feel as if you would like to do it again ? \u2014 honestly, noyv, did you not ? Ah, now, there is a good soul, you may depend upon it there is uo sin in telling the truth. You may be weak, but uot sinful. Now, feeling as you felt, can you wonder that my mother wanted to do it again, and that she should have said to my father aud me in the afternoon of the Sunday she had been to church in her new dress, \" I should like to go for a walk this afternoon if you will take me ?\" Now, what would you think and say, if, after you had made that splendid speech we have been talking about, and while the applause was yet ringing in your ears, you rose again for the purpose of making some additions which in the excitement you had forgotten, the chairman, or the speaker, as the case may have been, had refused to hear you upon the plea that you had already spoken? Would you not feel and say that be was jealous and envious, and that was why he would not permit you to add another laurel to the wreath of immortality with which your genius had crowned you? Perhaps you have never forgiven him for his want of respect and courtesy, or friendship even, which did not permit you to add the thoughts aud the deeds which would have astonished the world, and carried your name to far distant times. Alas, that your name is all that it would carry. Even Homer is but the combination of the five letters, of Milton of the six letters, and of Shakespear of the ten letters of the alphabet by which we know them. The thoughts they uttered are ours and all mankind's ; it is but the combination of letters which is their peculiar. Now tell me, did you feel a resentment at the want of courtesy of the chairman or speaker? A passing one, if you please, but still you felt it. Then how much more do you think my mother, who was not so wise as you, would resent my father and me refusing to take a walk with her in the afternoon of the Sunday as she requested ? My father, who understood my mother's temper, as I now know, much better than I did, said, \" But, my dear, you must be very fatigued after this morning's exertion, and will be much better if you rest yourself the remainder of the day.\" \" 0 dear no,\" said she, \" I was not fatigued at all, I do not know when I went through so much exertion with so little distress. On the contrary, I felt"], [194, "186 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. refreshed, and everything was delightful.\" As she said so, she gave one of her stately movements before the glass ; she swung her dress with such a graceful sweep, and said, \" I was not tired at all.\" She went to the window, looked up and down the street and said, \" I will go and put my things on.\" My father looked up at the sky, and said, \"It threatens for rain.\" \"No such thing,\" said my mother; \" there will be no rain to-day, I am sure there will not ; and it is very ill-natured of you to suggest such an idea ; it is like as if you wanted it.\" \" Very well,\" said my father, \" go and get ready, and John and I will take you.\" \" My dear,\" said my mother to my father in her kindest tones, \" you and John take a glass of wine whilst I am dressing;\" putting her hand iu her pocket, she said, \" there is the key.\" She tripped up stairs so nimbly, that I really thought she was getting young agaiu. Heretofore, when she had to go up stairs, it was a work of labour, and many sighs and many groans were uttered before the feat yvas accomplished ; but now she was going to display her new dress to the admiring people, she was up in a jiffy. Now, if you are a young lady, you need not smile at my mother ; you must remember well that when you were suffering with a dreadful sick headache and could scarcely stir, that when you were told that nice young man was passing who danced with you at the ball, how you sprung off the sofa, and was at the window in a twink. Now you were, you know you were. I am an old man now, and you need not be afraid to make the confes sion ; I shall not tell. I am sure you were, I can see by your blushing. When my mother came down stairs dressed, she really looked more handsome and blooming than when she had prepared for church. She was perfectly upright ; indeed she threw out her chest and bent in the small of her back just as a dandy guards man does, and there was an expression on her face which said as plain as plain, \" Look at me ; don't I look handsome in my new dress?\" She came moving her hands to get her fingers to the very bottom of her gloves, and marched with such majesty to the pier glass in the parlour to take a full length view, that I was really proud of my mother, and thought her the very queen of women. \" My dear,\" said she, turning to my father, \" I propose that we leave off calling this the parlour, and in future call it the"], [195, "TAKING A WALK. 187 withdrawing room. Don't you think it will be better \u2014 more ladylike and genteel ? \" \" Well,\" said my father, \" it will have a fuller sound with it.\" \"And is not everything,\" said my mother, with a slight touch of indignant pride, \" made better by fuller sounds? Is it anything but a fuller sound when you call a house a mansion, or a cottage the larches, or a woman my lady, or a man my lord ? they are but fuller sounds. I shall call my parlour my withdrawing room.\" \" Very well,\" said my father, \" how you like ; some people do think that a full sound carries dignity, and that a high sounding title alters human nature to something which transcends human nature.\" \"That is always the way with you,\" said my mother, \" always ; you want to reduce everything to what it was before it was dressed, and dressing adds so much ; look at me. Some people are nothing at all but the dressing ; take the dressing away, and they would be contemptible indeed, if not positive frights. Y'ou may do as you like, I shall call it the withdrawing room. I feel that as people get up in the world their ideas change, they get up too ; our ideas become lofty ; we call a brass pot a maslin kettle ; a parlour a with drawing room, and a man a lord ; our ideas become patrician, and we alter the names of everything accordingly.\" \" Yes,\" said my father, \"but the things remain the same.\" \" I beg your pardon,\" said my mother, with a slight frown of great superiority. \" Is not a maslin kettle scrubbed brighter and taken more care of when it is called a maslin kettle than it was when it was called a brass pot? Is not a withdrawing room dusted out more, taken more care of, and less used than if it were only a parlour ? and is not a man more conceited when he is called a lord ? Don't tell me ; though I do sit at home I know something of the world.\" \"Had you not better become great,\" said my father, \" by giving fuller names to everything ? \" \"I know what you mean,\" sard my mother ; \" you want to sneer, but I am too old for that ; it is not sneering which will take the truth out of me ; while I know that all people like full sounding names, and believe that full sounding names confer dignity, I don't see why I should not use them. Haven't I heard you say that there is many a jackass in life, and many a silly thing in the world get into posts of honour only because they have full names. Don't tell me ; I shall use them. Who knows what my John would have been if"], [196, "188 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. he had had a fuller name ? Doesn't every one know that the King of England is a greater man than the President of America, if one has been born to it, and the other the pick out of many millions ; and why is it ? Only because one has a fuller name than the other. Don't tell me ; I shall call my parlour the with drawing room.\" \" Very well,\" said my father, \" call it the withdrawing room. Now, are you ready ?\" \" Yes,\" said my mother, \" I am quite ready,\" and she drew up one side of her new dress, and held it with her elbow while she prepared to take my father's arm upon one side, and mine upon the other. \" My dear,\" said my father, \" if you hold up your dress so high you will show your petticoat.\" \" I want to show my petticoat,\" said she; \" what do you think I have put this rioh needlework and lace round the bottom for, and yvhat I have taken the trouble to run those beautiful tucks all round for?\" \" I thought it was to please me,\" said my father. \" To please you, indeed,\" said my mother; \"what do you care about beautiful petticoats upon yvhich weeks and weeks of labour have been spent? \u2014 nothing at all. You have not a refined taste; it is only ladies who are so gifted, and I heave up my dress that they may see them. What is the use of me being dressed, if I do not excite their jealousy ?\" \" None whatever,\" said my father. \" The gentlemen would prefer to see you undressed.\" My mother gave my father a playful smack on the face, and said, \" He knew nothing about it. He had better speak for himself, and not for gentlemen in general. Let the gentlemen in general deliver their own opinions.\" \" Well,\" said my father, \"are you ready?\" \"Yes,\" said she, \"lam quite ready.\" So both of us went into the hall ready to go, but my mother said to my father, \" My dear, when I went up stairs to dress I desired you and John to take a glass of wine; did you do it ?\" \" O yes,\" said my father. \" Then 1 think it very ill natured of you indeed, not to have the same forethought and kindness for me I had for you ; but you bave no thought, no thought whatever. If I did not know how thoughtless you were I should think it positive unkindness.\" She held out the keys at arm's length with such majesty, and said, \" Give me a glass of wine.\" My father gave her the glass of yvine.

She said, \" It yvas exceedingly vulgar to put our gloves on in the street ; it was mean and low, and altogether unbecoming the dignity of gentle- men.\" \" Pshaw !\" said my father. \" Pshaw !\" said my mother. \" Ah, you may pshaw; but let me tell you this, it is little things which make the gentleman, lou know a gentleman by his atteution to trifles\" \"Yes,\" said my father, \"trifling minds are occupied with trifles, great men are usually slovens.\" \" The more shame for them,\" said my mother; \"if they would attend more to trifles and less to things which don't concern them, it would be better for them. O dear me, I have quite forgotten \u2014 open the door again.\" My father opened the door again, and said, \" What is the matter now ? There is so much trouble to start a woman on a journey of pleasure or even a walk of pleasure, that you never know when you have done. What is it?\" \" I had forgotten my handkerchief; you could not want me to go out without my handkerchief; whatever should I do with my nose ? \" My mother took each of us by the arm, first lifting her gown so as to show her petticoat, as I have before described, and we three marched along with such majesty and grace, as if all our side of the street belonged to us, and we wished to frown down by indignant pride all intruders. When we came to a crossing my mother let go both our arms, and lifted dress and petticoat so high that my father said in haste, \" My dear, my dear, vou are showing your legs !\" \" What does that matter,\" said mv mother; \" you would not have me drag my lace petticoat and my new dress in the dirt ; better show my legs than do that.\" On we marched again. \" What are those fellows looking and laughing at?\" said my mother. \" What fellows,\" said my father. \" I hose three counterskipping fellows over the way,\" said my mother. \" They are no gentlemen, or they would not laugh so vulgarly as they do.\" \" Look at those two ladies on the other side,\" said my father, \" how serious they look ; I do believe they have some designs upon John.\" \" 1 see them, I see them,\" said my mother ; \" it is not my John who excites their attention ; they are ladies of taste, and are admiring my new dress. 0 it is"], [198, "190 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. heavenly to walk anaong ladies of taste !\" \"But, my dear,'' said my father, who was always wicked enough to throiv in some moral reflection, even in the midst of enjoyment, where moral reflections are altogether out of place ; the more foolish people are then, the better is the fun \u2014 \" My dear, suppose you were dressed in rags and in poverty ; would it be delightful ? You might be as good a woman as you are now, though borne down by poverty and rags.\" \" But I am not in rags; I have on a new dress and a laced petticoat ; I hate a man who introduces deaths' heads and marrow bones on festive occasions ; leave them for the church or gravestones ; they are in place there, among the rest of the heavy and serious things. That is the proper place for them, and not when you are walking out as we are. A wise person will never let such things interfere with their pleasures.\" So we went on walking and talking, my mother appropriating every look and every smile the ladies gave to herself, and sincerely believing that the thoughts and conversations of all she met were about herself and her dress, and whether they were or not securing as much delight and pleasure therefrom as if they were. Pray, Sir, did you ever believe yourself to be the man the world wanted ? We will say when you were young and inexperienced, did you ever engage in public business and dictate your lessous of wisdom? Did you ever wonder what would become of the world when you were dead? How would it be kept right then ? Ah, Sir, the matter which aroused your vanity may not have been a silk dress, but the weakness of my mother was with you. The sun's light plays upon the ripples and dazzles with its dancing sheen. It gilds the mountain tops and makes their rugged sterility a scene of great beauty ; it plays upon the lily in virgin whiteness, and gives the blush to the rose ; it gives the landscape its many shades, and the rainbow its many colours. Various as are its manifestations, it is the one blessed light of the sun ; and so is vanity. It is a protean passion, and takes as many shapes as there are human beings; and yvretched, indeed, is he in whom it finds no place. The beggar who sits upon the bridge and moans for charity ; the esquire who rides to the hunt and chucks him a copper as he passes ; the statesman who plots in his cabinet ; the hero who tells of the enemies he has slain ; the orator to whom a world will listen ; the poet who sings his"], [199, "191 TAKING A WALK. sweet song in solitude, or is crowned in Olympian halls ; the paiuter who limns scenes of beauty which put nature to the blush; the traveller who wanders among the solitudes of the wilderness ; the king at whose throne millions bend the knee ; he who records these wild fancies, aud every mother's son this world holds or has held, have my mother's weakness. Smile at it, be pleased by it ; but depend upon it there is some one who is pleased by yours. Oh, how we all laugh at each other ! We had gone to the length of our walk, and the big clouds became piled upon each other, like mountain upon mountain. Things which were far away were distinctly seen, so clear was the under atmosphere. The upper sky became suddenly filled with storm ; cloud met cloud, and rolled about in majestic grandeur ; the giant mountains were in rage, for there was war in the heavens. Jove's own bolt shot from the dark cloud, and Jove's own thunder bellowed with a mighty roar and shook the earth ; the big drops of rain came patting down, then burst forth in pelting showers, as if the floods of heaven had broken loose. My mother screamed, gathered up her dress anyhow, and ran beneath an elm tree for shelter. \" My dear,\" said my father, \" the lightning may strike that tree and shiver it ; come here, let us take shelter in this cottage.\" My mother screamed again and ran to the cottage, with her dress in all manner of forms. She was quick ; I did not think she had such a pace iu her. She sat upon a chair as soon as she entered ; her wind was gone. \" O dear ! O dear ! O dear !\" said she puffing and panting. \" My dear,\" said my father, \" it has winded you; it is almost too much for you.\" \" Yes,\" said she, \"yes, but \u2014 I \u2014 do \u2014 not \u2014 think \u2014 it \u2014 has hurt my dress.\" \" I don't think it has,\" said my father; \" you held everything up so I could see nothing but your legs and a balloon.\" \"Never mind,\" said she; \"I have not spoiled my dress, that is one blessing.\" We sat in the cottage until the storm was over, then we went home in a bustle. It was haste, baste, haste; there was no time for vain glorious swagger; the state of heaven had stopped all that. Look well to yourself; may your boasting vanity have no worse a finish ! If you are as harmless as my mother with it, I do not care how much, peacock like, you spread your tail, and sun yourself before what you think is an admiring world."], [200, "192 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTEK XXX. MORALISING. In one corner of the smoke-room at the Eagle and Ball sat Mr. Twittles and Mr. Blunt, taking a quiet pipe, and between the whiffs they were enjoying a broken and confidential chat as usual. Mr. Blunt was gaining information on this occasion upon the manner in which business was conducted iu Mr. Goader's office. \" You see,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" the different way in which people receive service of copies of writs is very amusing. The old hands receive them, put them in their pockets, and say 'very well ;' but some yvho have never been served before, stamp and swear, and threaten all manner of kinds of vengeance. Ay, ay, thinks I, never mind, you will not do that when you are broke in. They are just like unbroken colts, they toss their heads about, try to shake off the bridle and the bit, whisk their tails, rear before and plunge out behind. But Lord bless you, Mr. Blunt, it is all of no use 1 the law is a bridle no one can shake off until the lawyer lets them: that he never does while he thinks there is anything to be got out of them. Now, our governor comes to me and he says, ' Mr. Ttvittles, this man that is in the office, how is he ?' I know what ' how is he?' means, it means this, ' can he pay ?' If I say he can, he advises him to go on with his action ; to be firm and unyielding ; give them the law ; let them know what it is to fall out with you. If I say it is doubtful, he says it is usual to have our costs as we go on \u2014 merely the stamps and agent's charges ; but if I say he cannot pay, he says now I will advise you to settle this matter, the law is very expensive, and you may soon be ruined ; but if our client is indignant, and will not settle, he says very well, the law is doubtful. I may get my expenses out of the other side, or I"], [201, "193 MORALISING. may not. At any rate, I want some money before I go any further. So you see we never trust when we see there is nothintr to be got by trusting. Some of the greenhorns who come to us think our object is justice ; that we carry on our profession because we are in love with righteousness. Lord bless you, they are jolly green ! we are in love with nothing but the money it brings.\" \" I have always thought,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" that life is a sort of scramble, in which every one strives to get the most for himself, but that every man sets up some pretence, under cover of which he scrambles. You follow the law, men come to you full of resentment for some real or imagined wrong ; or they are poor, and their creditor will not wait, but will make them pay when they have not the means of paying. You administer to their resentment, or you obtain delay ; that is your pretence, under cover of which you scramble, getting all you can. There is the jeweller, he makes his jewellery to suit the vanity of the vain, under that pretence he scrambles. There is the doctor, he gets on the blind side of his patients, finds out their foibles and weaknesses, and by judiciously working them does more than by medicine, that is his pretence. There is the barrister, whose theory it is that he pleads for justice and truth, whose soul is so pure that he disdains rewards. Yet before he takes up a case he looks at the fee upon the brief, he will not plead if that be not up to his expectation : under an honourable pretence he scrambles, getting all he can. So you may go on. Life is but a scramble for gain, and there are as many pretences almost as there are men.\" \"You are right, Mr. Blunt,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" If you were to be in our office for a few days you would see a side of human nature which is unknown to you now, and think very meanly of mankind ; so meanly that you would not wonder at our governor feeling a natural disgust at such a display, and being determined to make the most he can out of it. The selfish side of human nature is very uninviting, and in our office we see nothing but selfishness. The son against the mother, if he thinks his mother stands in the way of his receiving money j the mother against her children ; friend against friend ; brother against brother ; man against woman ; and woman against man ; selfish ness from beginning to end.\" \" Am I right,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" that poverty is a more fruitful field for the law to work in than B"], [202, "194 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. any other ? that there are more people in trouble in consequence of poverty than from all the other causes put together? that in fact the service of the law, from the lord chief justice to the policeman, are more frequently required by it than by crime ? \" \" That,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" is an observation I have frequently made myself. You know how a barrister plumes himself upon his honour, and the etiquette of hi3 profession ; you would sup pose from his manner it was all honour with him, and no money. Yet they will come to our governor aud solicit his orders for opinions, allowing him a percentage upon all he gives them, just like a common tradesman, and with as much perseverance as the bum baly solicits executions, or Jack Ketch to perform the last offices of the law. Those are offices a poor unsophisticated man would think none but the most vile would fill, and that with reluctance ; but let me tell you they are solicited for by men who have a high opinion of themselves, and pray to God as devoutly as if they never soiled their fingers with men's dirty work. I am now hardened to these things, Mr. Blunt ; yet when I see a poor man stripped of all he has got, his home broken up, and his children scattered to fight the fight of life because of man's inhumanity to man, or the unrelenting grasp of avarice, the old feelings I had before I wa3 hardened rise up hke rebels, and make it a painful task to perform my duty ; but then it is poverty is the cause of all this : the barrister is poor, and he solicits employment that the fees he receives may remove his poverty ; the judge sits on the bench deciding man's disputes to remove his poverty ; the bum baly and Jack Ketch perform their menial and unthank ful offices to remove their poverty ; and upon poverty they all do execution. There is less of crime produced by the mere love of criminality \u2014 infinitely less than there is by the goadings and the gnawing of hunger and poverty. I have seen men come into our office and fall foul upon their fellows with curses and hard language, using every epithet of opprobium their tongues could muster, calling them scoundrels, rouges, bars, thieves ; there was nothing too foul and nothing too fierce for them to utter, when I have been as certain as you sit there, Mr. Blunt, that they who had aroused all this ire were poor and not criminal. Never mind, I have said, we shall nab you before we have done with you, and"], [203, "MORALISING. 195 give \\ ou a lesson in life you have not yet learned. 1 am a lawyer's clerk, Mr. Blnut, and hardened. I am ready for any rascality ; yet I must confess there is many a man a good Christian, though a bad tradesman, and there has been many a one condemned as a villain who was only an unfortunate ; but, as our governor says, we have no business with feelings in our office, either of pity or revenge ; we have only to get money for our clients, but above all, money for ourselves ; it is our duty to see justice and execution done upon both plaintiff and defendant, and by all that is evil our governor does it.\" \"Ay, ay,\" said Mr. Blunt, \"all men throw stones at a distempered dog, flog a sprained horse, avoid a man afflicted with a contagious fever, or fall foul upon the unfortunate. The little child who can but just toddle will shout after the simpleton with as much gusto as the full-grown baby who enjoys the fun derived from jeering the poor imbecile. It is the way of the world, Mr. Twittles, to trample on and oppress the poor and unfortunate, and bow down low, as doth the Indian devotee, and worship success. Tell a man another is a rogue, and a scoundrel, and the charge passes without challenge, and is believed upon the mere assertion ; say that another is a good and honest man, and you will be required to bring much proof, and support it by many instances \u2014 even then the probability is you only silence, not convince, your adversary. A man who believes all mankind are rogues, is either a great one himself, or is like Tommy Allen, who rode through King's Norton in bis gig, and saw but two men, they were marked with pickled cabbage on tbe cheek, then came home and bet a wager tbat all the men at King's Norton were marked with pickled cabbage.\" At this time a coach drove up to the door, and Tom, or as he was better known by his other name, \"the Coachee,\" came into the room to look for Mr. Twittle3. \" I have had a pretty chase after you,\" said the Coachee. \" I have been driving all over the town for you.\" \" What is it, Tom ? \" \" Here, your governor sent me with this note for you, and I am to drive you were you want to go. I have got a brown paper parcel in my coach, which I was to give you when you had read the note.\" Mr. Twittles opened the note and read it. \"Mr. Twittles, upon receipt of this, will go to Mr. Mincher's, and see the conveyance properly signed and delivered. He need"], [204, "196 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. not put in the dates ; I will attend to that. Secrecy and despatch are required. When executed you will bring the deeds to tbe office and this note. It is necessary they should be signed to-day, so you must follow and find. Tom must be charged to the office.\" \"Mr. Blunt,\" said Tom, \"you know Old Charley ; well, he was taken badish on the stand, very badish, so we took him into the Plume of Feathers, we did, and we wanted him to have the doctor; but Old Charley said, 'No, I'll have no doctors' stuff, I won't. I don't know what it's made on. All sorts of messes I'll be bound. Perhaps dead hosses. I know they have some sometimes. They say it's to study from ; but what's dead hosses to do with study I should like to know ? More likely to make doctors' stuff. I have seen too much, I have, to be gammoned in that way. A dead hoss may be as good physic as anything else, when you know what he has died on ; but when you don't, what sort of physic is he ? \u2014 give me a quartern of gin, net.' So we give him a quartern of gin ; but Coventry Ben said as how there was nothing like Cayenne pepper, and ginger, and nutmeg, about three spoonfuls, it always cured him, it was so warming and comforting ; so as the gin did him no good we gave him that, but he was no better. The Grecian said, ' Shure and there was nothing like whiskey for the gripes, the regular good clane Irish whiskey; shure, and what was there in pepper but jumgeny, unless it was the roughness ? You had better soak some sawdust in whiskey and swallow that, there would be some sense in it then ; you would have the roughness of the one and the warmth of the other. Whiskey is the genuine physic ; it will cure anything, especially sorrow. It's the real thing is whiskey. Give it to a fighting man, and see what courage it puts in him ; he will fight with any man. Give it to the hungry, and it's as good as meat and drink to him. That's the stuff; give him some of that, and he will be cured in a jiffy.' So we gave him half-a-pint ; for the Grecian said it yvas not a fair trial\u2014 one quartern was not enough. So we give him another, but he was no better. So, says I, give him some brandy, that's the top liquor of all ; if he is to be cured by spirits that is it will do it. It is neither your giu, your rum, nor your whiskey that is to do it, but your brandy. So I shouldered my way through them as"], [205, "MORALISING. 197 they stood round him, almost ready to smother him, aud I give him two good stiff glasses hot. It soon cured him of the gripes ; but then his head was mithered, aud poor fellow he kept wandering in his wits. He called for his mother. It is a strange thing, ain't it, Mr Blunt, that if a fellow is taken ill dangerously, aud thinks he shall die, he always keeps on a wandering iu his mind for his mother, and thinks as how it is her as is to save him. If he has got a wife he thinks as how it is her as is to comfort him, but his mother as is to save him. It is a very strange thing. When a man is a man he should be strong euough to do without so much mothering. So he does, till he thinks as how he is dying, then be he as big as he will, he wants his mother. So old Charley kept on mitheriug about his mother and his wife, so we put him in his coach, aud the Grecian drove him home. Well, Mr. Twittles, how are the orders, what's the route ?\" \" Whet your whistle before you go, Tom,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" And put it down to the office, Tom,\" said Mr. Blunt. \" What, as brandy ? \" said Tom, winking at Mr. Blunt, in imitation of his humour, when he was inclined to be humourous. \" Leave it to Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" he knows how to charge it to the office ; you charge it in the fare ; you have been driving all over the town, a-sweating and a-blowing of your horse in the service of Mr. Goader. You don't know how many miles you have been a-driving \u2014 charge it in the fare. They don't pay, you know, Tom ; it is put down to their client for coach hire. There is many a thing besides brandy put down to the clients. No longer since than yesterday there was Mr. Biteum, Mr. Doublebee, and Mr. Fireby, sitting iu the httle parlour, arranging a reference ; they had three bottles of wine, cigars, and biscuits. When they had almost finished the wine they began to look merry. I went in aud said, ' I hope you are enjoying it, gentlemen.' ' Take a glass, Mr. Blunt,' said Mr. Fireby. ' Who's the victim,' said I, ' you are offering up on the altars of your country ?' ' Never you mind,' said Mr. Biteum ; ' drink the wine aud ask no questions.' ' A verv good direction,' says I. * If I am committing a sin by drinking wine of which a poor man is being robbed, and I do not know it is a sin, it cannot be a sin, can it ? For there to be a sin, there must be a sinner, and if that sinner have no guilty"], [206, "198 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. kuoyvledge, that can be no sin ; for the intention, gentlemen, ex pressed or to be reasonably inferred is essential to crime. For if I throw a missile, say a quoit, and it strikes one of the players, and kills him, it is an accident, there being no intention to kill ; but if 1 have expressed an intention to murder the player I had killed by accident, though that expression had been made in the heat of blood, and I had killed him when the blood wa3 cool, yet that expression had in the eye of the law made that which was but an accident wilful murder. For, gentlemen, it is not in the mind of man to tell what is in the heart of man, and as the intentions of a man are kept secretly in a man's own breast, we can only know what those intentions are by some visible sign or outward manifestation ; and as it would be very illogical and wrong to suppose any sane individual to act with out intentions, we must take those to be the intentions of yvhich we see some reasonable sign. Therefore, if I have no knowledge that I am committing a sin, I am no sinnei.' ' Ha, ha, ha; why Mr. Blunt, you are a special pleader.' ' Well, gentlemen,' said I, ' here is a safe deliverance to the victim, and may you all make a good bill of costs.' ' Bravo, bravo I Mr. Blunt.' Now Mr. Biteum paid for the entertainment, but it will not appear in his bill of costs as wine, biscuits, and cigars, but as a more law-like item, eh, Mr. Twittles ; \" and Mr. Blunt winked at Mr. Twittles, and Mr. Twittles winked at Mr. Blunt, and Tom winked at his brandy and water several times. \" Lord ! \" said he, \" what a funny thing life is. You must live until you are a very old man to be up to all the dodges and down to all the games, and perhaps when you are a very old man you will not know half of them. If I was to have another glass, Mr. Twittles, would that be coach hire as well? \" \"We will try it on,\" said Mr. Twittles. Tom slapped his hand upon his thigh with an expression as if he had just made a discovery, \" That is it, Mr. Blunt, I see it all, I have often puzzled my brains to find out why it i3 that all the officers of law, from the highest to the lowest, all look sleek, and fat, and well, and contented, and happy, while all the debtors and prisoners look full of trouble and full of sorrow. That is it ; the one can have wine, and biscuits, and cigars at the other's expense, and the other cannot have any at their own or any body else's. That is it.

Why he should be sent to the knackers like a used-up hoss ; he cannot do more work, to get a shilling or two for his old carcass.\" \" What shall become of his soul ?\" said Mr. Twittles, joining in the humour. \" You are a fine fellow to talk about souls,\" said Mr. Blunt ; \" under the form of one writ and another you do what you like with his body, and if you could serve a copy of a writ upon his soul and stay its flight to another world you would do it.

When we peruse the recital of man's deeds, we are attracted only by the more promineut and passionate, and think not of the quiet and the still of which, after all, our lives consist. Mr. Fireby was an instance of an attorney passing through life without a stain, or, at any rate, without intending to do anything which should leave a stain upon his name. He was at one time a partner of Mr. Goader. Why they separated I did not know ; but it was obvious to a person of moderate observation that the two men were unequally yoked. The one was all intellect and self, allowing nothing to interrupt him in the pursuit of riches ; the other was, perhaps, not so intellectual, but certainly more of a gentleman, and desirous of doing what was right iu a straightforward way, never leaving the path of rectitude and probity, even though it miaht diverge into that of wealth. The one has passed away, and left none, either directly or collaterally, to continue his name ; tradition has surrounded his memory with dark deeds, aud the elders tell their children of his wickedness. In a lonely churchyard, amid docks and nettles, his remains lie, and no man cares for him. The other has left a name which good men turn to with pride ; his opiuion was sought with confidence by the younger members of his profession, and it was freely and truly given ; when called upon to settle a quarrel, he never embittered it that he might enlarge his bill, but always advised it to be met with gentleness aud peace. If friends disagreed \u2014 and friends will sometimes disagree \u2014 he endeavoured to re-unite the bioken friendship. He was a Christian and a man, although an attorney, and he has left behind him a worthy representative. Let his name be honoured. Whenever my father had auy business to do which required legal assistance, it was placed in the hands of Mr. Fireby. Since the days whose deeds I am recalling many improvements and reforms have been made in the law, which have made it less an instrument of oppression than formerly, so much less that those who were not close observers yvhen youug can form no idea of the hardships of those who came under its power. There are yet forms which a needy or bad man can use to obtain his own selfish ends. The"], [211, "203 TROUBLE AGAIN. forms may be in themselves just and reasonable, but in the hands of a needy and avaricious man they are made the instruments of injustice. But they are now merciful and kiud in comparison to those formerly existing. No picture the most imaginative can depict will ever convey truly the sorrows and ruins, and hatreds and oppressions, and broken homes aud broken hearts, which once tracked their course. \" Good morning,\" said Mr. Levy, as he entered our warehouse with a grin that was intended for a laugh \u2014 one of those grins with which a bad man attempts to be polite or sarcastic, you cannot at first tell which, and you must have some other indi cations of temper before you are able to decide \u2014 \" Good morn ing ; I have called upon you to redeem this bond,\" said Mr. Levy, at the same time holding it in his left hand, and beating a rapid tattoo upon it wdth the forefinger of his right, and repeating the words, \" This bond ! this bond ! \" \"1 hat bond I \" said my father, with some surprise ; for you see Mr. Levy owed my father much more money for jewellery than the amount of the bond, and which money had not been called for, as it was in tended that it should be placed as a set-off; therefore was my father much surprised at the demand made for its payment. \" That bond ! \" repeated by father. \" Ye3,\" reiterated Mr. Levy, at the same time unfolding it, and holding it up to my father's face, \" this bond ; you know it asjain ; you are not going to deny it is yours ? \" \" No,\" said my father, \" I am not going to deny it.\" \" I thought not,\" grinned Mr. Levy, \" and it would not matter if you did ; it would be all the same \u2014 there is your signature, there is your seal, and that is the witness ; come, Sir, pay it.\" \" Very well,\" said my father, \" there need not be this display of feeling ; I am not going to run away.

But, Sir, are you not ashamed of yourself to attempt to use the advantage your position gives you, to attempt to ruin me as you threaten, or to obtain more money than is your due, as I suppose is your intention ? What has been my conduct to you that I should merit this treatment? It has been throughout our connection honourable and straightforward ; why should you act in this way ? Is it the nature of you ? Are you naturally dishonest? Would you be a rogue for sixpence, or violate all the feelings which bind man to his kind for a shilling ? Is there nothing but law which keeps you honest ? Nay, will you use the forms of law for dishonest purposes? Is it that you will say nothing without you nave money, and that you will do nothing without you have money ? Is it to be gain with you in every thing \u2014 nothing but gain? Sir, let me tell you this \u2014 and I do not use the language as a threat, or as the mere vent for feelings which have been pent up in my mind, but as the sober deductions of experience \u2014 that such conduct will neither redound to your reputation nor your wealth ; and let me tell you, further, that if you have some lawyer who has suggested to you some quirk by which he can assist you to be dishonest, and is willing to do so, like you, for gain, that some of those judges who watch over the administration of justice to see that its purity is unstained should drive the rascal from the profession he would dishonour, strip him of his ill-gotten gains, and turn him upon the world, lo live upon the gratitude of those he has served. It is a little mind which thinks of nothing but gain ; a dishonest mind which cares not how gain comes, so it comes.

A NEGOCIATION. \" John,\" said my father, \" my experience of life is at fault here ; I thought that matter of Mr. Levy's was arranged by the account I had against him, but his manner is sufficient to tell me I am deceived. It is probable that he has frequently lent money to people, and is therefore aware of some plan by which he can make a further gain out of the transaction than the one agreed upon. His passion may be real, or assumed ; but be it how it may, it will vanish when all is arranged to his satisfaction. If stolen waters were sweet to his countrymen of old, money obtained by craft or cunning is sweeter to him ; yea, as sweet as a honey pot of virgin honey. With him sin gives relish to enjoyment, and money obtained from the folly or fears of another is with him wealth indeed. I must go to Mr. Fireby and enquire what my position is at once, for I shoidd not be surprised to find myself arrested ; he is in that humour and temper that nothing will stay him in the course upon which he has entered. If he were a man purely of passion, I might hope that, when his passion was abated, milder and more generous counsels would prevail ; but as passion is with him only a weapon which he uses to obtain his ends, I must not neglect anything, or I may be ruined before I am aware.\" \" Father,\" said I, \" surely matters are not so serious as that ; I have heard you say that the law is the perfection of human reason, and it never can be the perfection of human reason to allow one man to use its forms for the oppression of another.\" \"No, my son,\" said my father, \"neither a judge, a jury, nor the law-makers would make the laws for oppressive purposes ; we have, most fortunately, past the time the law was intended for tyrant kings, or for subjects more tyrannical than"], [217, "209 A NEGOCIaTIOS. tyrant kings ever were : and if those who use it for oppressive purposes were b__4dly to proclaim the object intended, the judge aad tbe jury would not assist them.

Mr. Fireby wished him good morning, and shook hands with him ; then pointing my father to a seat, sat down himself in his arm chair, putting his spectacles at the same time up his bald forehead, and placing the palms of his hands on the ends of the chair elbows ; he sat, upright, with his chest firmly forward, and looked my father full in the face, while he told his grievance. \" Ah,\" said he. \" you must pay that bond.\" \" But,\" said my father. \" you have forgotten that he owes me more than I owe to him.\" \" No, I have not,\" was the answer ; \" you cannot plead a set-off against a bond ; a bond is a deed, and a deed is one of the most solemn instruments known to the law. If he owed you a thousand times the value which is secured to him by the bond, the bond must be paid. You can make no set-off against it. There is nothing but pay ment will satisfy it, and nothing but fraud upon the face of it, or an immoral or illegal consideration will set it aside. You must pay it ; there is nothing for you, you must pay it.\" \" This,\" said my father, \" is a very unjust state of things ; he owes me more money than I owe him, yet I must pay him without being allowed the right, I call it, of setting off part of what he owes me against what I owe him.\" \" You see,\" said Mr. Fireby, \"your debt is one of simple contract, and his is secured by deed.

You must pay if.\" \" I must confess,\" said my father, \" I cannot.\" \" Have you had any quarrel with him since the deed was executed ?\" My father told him what had taken place, and all that had taken place. \" I see,\" said he, \" he wants more money from you than the bond entitles him to, and it will be your best policy to give it him. How much does he want ?\" \" But,\" said my father, \" is the law of that kind that it will allow him thus to rob me? for I can call it by no other name.\" \"Well, you had better not call it by that name ; it does no good, it will not assist you at all.

Tnis was repeated dav after day until my client said, ' I wish you would leave off grumbling ; ease your mind, call me a d fool, and adone with it.'

He can commence proceedings against you on the bond, and you can commence proceedings against him on the debt. You can have as much law for a guinea as he can have for one pound one. Your debt may be swallowed up in eosts, your feelings may be gratified, but your money will be gone ; and I cannot advise von to go to law at all to gratify your indignation. Your sufferings wid not change the law; it will remain just the same after you are ruined, ready enough to ruin any oue else. I will see Mr. Goader, and try to settle it for you. Now be advised, I will take vour case, and carry it on ; but if yon will be ruled by me, you will settle. I will get to know what is wanted, and then vou can make up your mind what you will do.\" The earnest and kind manner of Mr. Fireby prevailed. My father permitted him to ascertain what was wanted, and was to see him again in the afternoon. Mr. Fireby, believing the business to be urgent, went to Mr. Goader at once. As soon as he entered the clerks' cffice thev were all obsequiousness, ready to do anything for Mr. Fireoy. \" Shall I take a message in, Sir,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" I think he is likely to be engaged some time, and perhaps he will see you in the little room.\" Now the httle room was adjoining Mr. Goader's room, having an opening upon the back stairs from his"], [220, "212 KKCOl.l.KCTIONS OI' A TH A I> K.SM A N. room nnd the Imll, so Mint if Mr, (loader had to retire for any purpose, or to go out, for a short walk, lie could do so without being seen by Ihc client* ivho were wailing ; he could even Icuvii the client who was consulting him in his room, giving the idea of a long consultation 10 the Others.

He may be charged with cruelty, when he is only executing his duty. He may be called ungrateful, because the law commands him to act. No ; an attorney should give up friends and companions, and should walk through the world without a desire for any of what are called its social blessings. He should be a very Ishmaelite \u2014 his hand against every man, and every man's hand against him. That is his only safety.\" \" The old opinions,\" said Mr. Fireby, \" in which I cannot coincide.

You want to make a set off which you know you cannot do, and you must pay for the accommodation.\" \"I think the terms very hard.\" \"And I"], [223, "215 A NEG0CIATI0N. think they are only lawyer-like, and what is more, you can have no better; so I wish you good morning\" \"Good morning,\" was the reply. \" Mr. Fireby,\" said Mr. Goader, by way of postscript, '\" you will tell your client we shall not wait, it must be paid before post time.\" Thus did the lawyer and the Jew use the law ; not, I believe, for the purpose of oppressing my father in any revengeful spirit, but to get money out of his necessities. Mr. Goader came to the office door, and recalled Mr. Fireby to tell him that my father had been very free in expressing his opinion respecting Mr. Goader's conduct, and requested him to say that it was a very dangerous thing to express any opinions respecting him, and that if he were not careful, he would find himself the defendant in an action for slander. So that my father had to suffer wrong, and dare not bring public opinion to bear upon it, for fear of an action for slander.

When my father was told the result of the interview betwee the two attorneys his indignation was great. \" What,\" said he, \" will, and does the law give to a man the power of oppression which is being used against me ? I had fondly believed the law was based upon justice; but where is the justice which applies in my case. It is and can be no more than a robbery according to law. If my feelings naturally revolt against such conduct, and I give expression to those feelings, I am to be threatened with an action for slander, and I suppose the law will support them in that action.\" \" It will,\" said Mr. Fireby ; \" my advice to you, therefore, is to give no occasion for such an action. No expressions of yours will alter the law. It has a remedy for every wrong, and will not permit one wrong to be set off against another, and the balance. struck in satisfaction thereof.\" \" But what remedy is there for this wrong which is attempted to be imposed upon me ?\" \" It is not a wrong iu the eye of the law, and the law will not look at it as a wrong ; everything is looked at by itself ; its consequences are thrown out of considera tion, the stern decisions of justice are followed, and the consequences which arise from those decisions are treated, not as defects of the judgment, but as the sins of the sufferer. My good man, the law and your want of means united have put you in a fix, the result of which is injustice. Sharp practitioners do their best to put the opposite party in a fix, and make the wrong or whatever else it may be, issue in a dilemma ; wliich issue the Court decides, irrespective of its consequences.

He was like a man who"], [226, "218 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. sits down contemplating the difficulties he imagines he will have to contend against, until an overwhelming feeling of depression comes upon him, and he is ready to surrender life for freedom, and leave all its troubles for bolder hearts to meet. That dull insensibility, that want, of foreknowledge of consequences, that absence of thought which some mistake for bravery, might have served him on occasions like this, for there are times when a man is best served by negations ; when he should patiently wait and leave events to themselves ; but my father tried on all occasions to guide events ; if he sometimes surrendered the reins to others, he was very assiduous in watching the way they were going. His anxiety brought him trouble when there would have been none had he been less anxious His state of mind was caused quite as much by the knowledge that he was iu the hands of a selfish knave, who had been scheming to gain money from him unjustly, and was successful so far, as by any real difficulty he might have in meeting the case. He was honest and upright in all his dealings, and he felt a sense of great humiliation in the presence of successful knavery. When my father came home he was very silent. He walked about the warehouse full of thought ; first he would go to the books, as if he intended to work at them, but he could not. Then he would examine the jewellery, turning it over and over in his hands ; but his mind was not upon that, and I doubt very much if he saw what was in his hands. Then he would tie up some parcels, then untie them, and draw the string through his fingers. He then went to the desk, put his elbows upon it, and buried his face in his hands. When my father was under the influence of sorrow, there was neither sigh nor tear, but an utter prostration, as if his mental faculties were subdued by an all consuming grief. A stranger seeing him at such times would think him a dull, heavy, and glumpish man, but those who knew him, also knew how deeply he felt. Could he have called upon nature, as woman does, to give him relief in tears, the heavy trouble that was upon him might more easily have passed away. His was the grief which could not weep, the sorrow which has no vent. He would go into lonely places to grieve, and in the depth of his soul there would be great trouble. Some would say it is not manly to feel thus deeply, that the head should be carried"], [227, "219 ASSISTANCE. high, and the heart should toss the world aside and face its worst, doing battle with life in a spirit that means to conquer ; and that it is to be manly. But is it so ? Is it not rather a want of penetration which sees not the danger, a thoughtless ness which has not the power to foresee the consequences ? The youth may leave his home and pass into foreign lands with a light heart and a song ; may treat with a flippant laugh the fears which older heads express ; he is for life and life he will see. He will part the billows before him, and go into lands whose skies are cloudless, and whose mighty waters roll in a broad flood to the sea. The chase, the wild chase, shall call him to exercise, and his jocund cry shall ring through the forest. The world is before him, and through the world he wdl go. Is this courage, or want of thought ? When in the lonely forest, weary, and worn, the home he has left comes before him in the solitude ; and when he reposes in dreamland, and his soul gets to the old home again, with the fairy scenes of former happiness, and all the social feelings which bind him to his kin rush to his heart, he knows it was not courage which took him to the forest \u2014 he knew not the dangers which he would have to face \u2014 but want of thought. What he imagined he should find in the world tempted him ; had he known what he did find, no blandishments wculd have tempted him to roam. So it is often. A want of thought, a dull insensibility, is mistaken for courage. But to a man like mv father, who could usually see the end from the beginning, the fortitude which enabled him to face danger must be great, and before he enters upon a new phase of trouble, it is not cowardice to feel deeply, or to let the clouds which throw a cold shadow over life chill him. Let him feel as a man ought to feel, and then he will act as a man ought to act. When I saw that his feelings had somewhat subsided, and that I might venture to talk upon the matter which troubled him, I asked him what had taken place, and he told me ; but what surprised me was the quiet way in wh'.ch he told me ; though I knew how deeply he felt, he narrated it as if it were a simple matter of business \u2014 as if he did not feel the indignation a man should feel. I felt as if I should bike to meet the Jew, or the lawyer, or both of them together, and have it out in fighting \u2014 as if I would not mind paying the money if I could take a receipt in battle ; and I believe if I"], [228, "220 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. had met them, when the first burst of passion was upon me, I should have done so, regardless of the consequences. Time has fully convinced me now, that however indignant one may fed when suffering wrong, it is wiser to smother the feeling, or let it pass like a momentary pang, and think of it no more. But I bad other thoughts then ; it seemed to me right that a man should revenge his own wrongs, and not go troubling men about them who cared nothing for you ; use the means nature provided \u2014 your own strong arms and your own stout hearts ; be a man and fight out your own fight. 1 know now this would give the battle to the strong, the physically strong, and leave the weak to suffer. The athlete, right or wrong, would be master. \" Father,\" said I, \" shall I go and see Mr. Levy ? Perhaps the first burst of passion has gone, and he may be more merciful now. He must know that there is no likelihood that he will lose anything, because he has the means of payment in his own hands. Therefore, I may find him open to reason, or ready to yield to supplication.\" \" No, no, my son ; leave it to me. You have not seen enough of the world's ways to settle a matter of this sort. Besides, there can be no other settlement but payment.\" I saw that the depressing feelings under which my father laboured were passing away, and that he was preparing to look at the matter as a matter of business, and not as a fraud which he should struggle against and resent. Whenever my father got into trouble it at first had a very depressing effect upon him ; but he soon got over that, and began to see how he should get out of it in the best way ; and as soon as out of it, he tried to forget all but the lesson it taught ; thai he treasured up for his future guidance. To a man of ordinary thought it was very evident that the lessons of experience cannot always be followed, for there are times \u2014 as in times of monetary storms whose events I am recalling \u2014 when circumstances over-ride the best calculations, and difficulties appal the stoutest hearts. Man may plough the ground, and sow the seed, in the hope of the reward which the harvest will give ; but the spring may be cold and wet, the summer ungenial, and there may be no harvest. An empty garner may make the heart sad. So the tradesman may labour, and send the produce of that labour to the merchant, and the merchant may send it to the"], [229, "221 ASSISTANCE. market ; a panic may come, like a devastating storm ; suspicion, like a destroying angel, may fly through the land ; and losses, like a pestilence, may blight his hopes, aud all his exertions fail. The thought less will blame him, as if the devastating storm were raised by him, the destroying angel were his servant, or the pesti lence the work of his hands; but they are no more under his control than is the rain or the sunshine, the blight wliich withers and destroys the bloom, the pestilence which kills the cattle, or that which strikes his food with disease and rottenness. As a good tradesman he will not lie and die, but, like a true soldier, will up again to the fight, and if it were \" well bobet, will bobet again.\" The feelings which had overpowered my father were gone. He put on his hat firmly, and went out to see how he could meet the difficulty. I must confess that I had not much hope that he would succeed when I knew where he intended to apply. There is nothing so true as the adage that \" he who goes borrowing, goes sorrowing.\" The heart is heavy then, and if there be no success it is heavier still. When he was gone, I thought I would try a scheme of my own, by which the bond might be discharged. I have said that I had used to look with something like contempt upon Old Joe; that I thought him an old codger, one who was kept about the premises out of a foolish feeling, after he had become useless \u2014 a tool that had lost its steel, a dog who had lost his teeth, a horse whose mettle was gone, a thing done with, and to be thrown aside ; but, when he made my father the offer of all the money he had saved, I began to think there was some thing good in the old man. -Now my father was so much pressed I sought him out, and told him the position my father was in. I have said that after the quarrel I had with him he always treated me with a respectful deference ; there was in his manner towards me a loving regret, as if it had ahvays hurt the old man to think that the \"young master,\" as he called me, was his enemy; he who had gone through life without intending to offend any one, had given offence to me ; I, whom he had many a time carried about and played with, and held me on the back of our yard dog, Keeper, while I had a ride ; me whom he was fond of when 1 was a child, and had never forgotten to be proud of me as I grew up to manhood ; but the old man had offended me, and"], [230, "222 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. he kuew not how. When I told him of my father's difficulty, the old man said, \" He shall have the money ; he shall have the money, Master John ; he shall have the money.\" And the old man blubbered and cried like a child. \" Master, I did not mean to offend you when I refused to clean the window. I was proud and foolish, Master;\" and the old man held out his hand, and shook mine with a palsied shake. \" Forgive me, Master; forgive me.\" \" I do forgive you,\" said I, overcome by his earnestness and devotion. \" I see you possess the virtues of the olden times, and from henceforth you shall be one of us, Old Joe.\" And the old man bent his head upon my shoulder, and cried like a child."], [231, "ANGLING. 223 CHAPIEK XXXIV ANGLING. In the afternoon of the day in which the even's I have just nar rated occurred, Mr. i_.evy went into Mr. Goader's office ; his step was agile and nimble, like a man who has just accomplished an object of which he is proud. \" Mr. Twittles,\" said he,\" \" has the jeweller been here r\" \" He has not,\" was the reply, \" but Mr. Fireby has on his behalf.\" \" Mr. Fireby has, has he ?\" \" Yes ; and I heard our governor say thit the jeweller must mind what he was about, and not be so free in expressing his opinions, or he would fiud himself in a Court of Justice when he least expected. Leave our governor alone for that, he knows how to silence them ; he is the man for that. I never knew any one but you who did it so well.\" Mr. Levy here took up a pen, dipped it into the ink, and spotted Mr. Twittles's face all over ; he, nothing loth, en deavoured to return the compliment, and the two men struggled which would ink the other's face the most. \" Hang that,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" ycu are trying to make my face as black as your own.\" Mr. Levy dipped the feather end of the quill into the ink, and smeared the left side of his face, and they laughed like children at the success of this man\u0153uvre. It was not so much plav, as the conduct of men whose minds were relieved from the tension under which they had for some time been. After well laughing at each other, they went to a closet in which there was a wash-hand bowl, and removed the signs of their play. \" Mr. Levy,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" you have got the jeweller this time ; you will make him bleed ; for all he is so very careful, he is caught; that was a deep aodge of yours.\" \"Mine,\" said he, \" mine ! It was not mine ; it was the governor's.\" As he said so, he kept jerking his thumb towards Mr. Goader's room. \" I"], [232, "224 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. wish I was as clever as the governor ; I would get the guineas ; I would be the rich man soon. He is the clever man ; mine God ! he is clever.\" It was Mr. Levy's opinion that the man of most ability was he who made most money, and that the test of merit was money. Frequently had he debated the question at the Eagle and Ball. When it was argued that those men who devoted their lives to the investigation of the laws of nature, discovered their modes of action, and made them subservient to the wants or the luxuries of men, were the men the world should be proud of, he would pooh pooh them as persons not in their right mind, simple ami foolish; men fond of applause, always poor; well enough to pass an idle hour with ; all they wanted was to be pitied and patted ; and all that should be done for them was to patronise and forget them. But to the man who made a fortune he would erect a monument, if the fortune were not, in the eye of the world, monument enough. When he heard of Mr. Goader buying property after property, he would look at him just as does an old toper, who has lost his all in tippling except his love of it, look at the bacchant who spreads himself out recumbently be- hind his wine, and smokes his cigar with luxurious pleasure, and thinks it the very enjoyment of enjoyments. So did he think Mr. Goader the very man of men ; the example for himself, the example for his children, and the one great example for the world. There is no accounting for the heroes some men place in their Pantheon. To some Palmer the poisoner was the great man among great men ; Tom Crib the hero of heroes ; Dick Turpin the god of gods ; and he who \" makes a solitude and calls it peace\" the Jupiter of their Olympus. It is not always the creed the worshipper has been taught which dictates the wor- ship ; but there is something in the congeniality of temperament ; therefore did the wise men of old place many gods in heaven, that each devotee might have one he could wholly adore. To ask the miser to worship a god who is all bountiful, is to bring him to a shrine whose spirit he cannot understand ; to ask a tyrant to worship a god who is all mercy, is vain ; he doth not under stand the creed ; its language to him is gibberish, and its spirit a spirit lie knoweth not. There is not a flower wliich decorates the day, kisses the summer breeze, or sends its perfume through the air, but, before it was a flower, was a thought in the mind of God."], [233, "225 ANGLING. It may be but a fragile thing ; but how great its beauty ! how exquisite its mechanism! There is not an animai which treads the earth, cleaves the mighty waters, or visits the caves where the dolphins dwell, but was first a thought in the mind of God ; and how wonderfully is it made ! There is not a planet which rolls through space, or those far distant suns which are the stars ; there is not a comet which visits us, then wings its rapid flight to systems greater than ours, so far off that they seem but a speck in the eternity of space, but were once a thought in the mind of God. How grand they are ! The simplest zoo phyte which just stirs with bfe, and man, who is the image of his Maker, were once thoughts in the mind of God. The dia mond which flashes in the circlet of beauty, and the meteor which shoots like a falling star ; the lark which sings its matin song with joy, and the bird of night which pours forth its matchless melody when all things else sleep ; the moss which covers the abbey ruins with venerable antiquity, and the many-shaded verduie which fills the forest, and all things by which man is surrounded, were once thoughts in the mind of God ; and they are permanent and eternal. As they were when first those thoughts became realities, so are they now. The butterfly is a gay being in the summer sunshine, or a chrysalis in the cheerless winter. It is a caterpillar while there is caterpillar's food, a chrysalis during the winter months, when food there is none ; and the gay being which flits about from flower to flower, as long as they distil the nectar, which is its food. Such was the thought of God, and he made its faculties to serve the hours of light and the hours of darkness, and the periods of metamorphosis to correspond with the seasons. So it is with all He has made ; the intervals of sleep and wakefulness correspond with the intervals of day and night. The stages of life are as the stages of the year ; the seasons of life and the times of the year fit each other as the Great Master mind determined. The mind which conceived the spider's habits and character, and gave him the power to entrap his prey, which gave the feline race their stealthy tread and match less agility, the shark and the falcon the patience to watch and the power to strike the quarry with unerring aim, gave also these characters to some human minds. In the human mind is the type of all the animals He has made. The poor idiot has no ti"], [234, "226 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. more mind than the zoophyte has life; the character of the serpent, of the falcon, and the shark can be found in the mind of man as can also the godlike qualities which distinguish the celestial beings who for ever surround the throne of the Most High. No wonder, then, that the characters of the spider and the shark were to be found in the lawyer and the Jew. Mr. Mincher had been in consultation with Mr. Goader ; as he came out he made a faint and quiet bow to Mr. Levy, in which there was an expression of surprise, then left the office without any further recognition. Mr. Levy threw himself back as soon as he saw him, as if there was astonishment mixed up with surprise. He followed him with a scrutinising glance, and as he left, said to Mr. Twittles, \" What does he want ?\" Mr. Twittles expressed his inability to say, and Mr. Levy went into Mr. Goader's room. As he entered Mr. Goader was at the iron safe, putting money into his cash-box. He, therefore, had his back to Mr. Levy. He turned his head and looked at him over his shoulder. \" I am glad you are come,\" said he ; \"I wanted to see you ;\" and knowing how much Mr. Levy relished the sound of money, he chinked the gold in his hands again, and spread out the notes once more in his cash-box. He was not the man to let any opportunity pass which was likely to add to his reputation, and he knew well before what god the Jew bowed his head ; he knew it was the golden calf; and not to the Holy One of Israel. What he was placing in the cash-box was the guerdeon which won admiration. Had Mr. Levy known the services for which that guerdon was given another feeling would have been paramount with him. Mr. Goader never allowed any thing to pass which would please his client ; he therefore said, \" I wanted to see you. Mr. Fireby has been here on behalf of the jeweller, and wanted to make his account against you a set-off against your bond ; but I told him the request was preposterous ; that you would not do it ; and that I would not let you do it. He then wanted to know what you wanted to settle. I told him you must be paid your bond. Mr. Fireby said he had taken an interest in his client, and would take it as a personal favour if I would say the terms upon which you would settle. I told him you must have a receipt on your account and all your expenses paid, and that you would only do this as a favour to him, and to"], [235, "ANGLING. 227 gratify the interest he had taken in his client. He said he had taken an interest, and it may be that he had ; strange as it may appear, we do sometimes take a liking to a client, and serve him as much for friendship as for reward ; for instance now, I have taken a liking to you, and would serve you in every way I am able.\" \"Ay, ay,\" said Mr. Levy, \"you are a clever man; and I am bound to believe you will serve me when it is not against your own interests ; and I will serve you, and we will serve everybody else ; those we cannot serve as they deserve we will serve out,\" and the Jew laughed at this small wit, and Mr. Goader laughed because the Jew laughed, and said it was a smart and immensely clever thing. \" I told Mr. Fireby you would not wait, and that all must be settled this day ; for, you see, if we are to win, we must frighten the jeweller. We must throw him as much as possible into a panic ; we must be on him as fast and as heavily as the law will allow. It will be a poor thing if you and I cannot use the weapons the law puts in our hands with advantage. What does the world say of us ? They say lama lawyer, as if that were a tning to be rejected and hated ; and they say you are a Jew, as if that were a thing to be loathed. The world puts its ban upon both of us, and should we bless the world in return for its curse F -No, let us rather make it the mint by which we coin wealth. If we cannot be honoured, let us be feared. If he comes to ycu, you must be firm, and refer him to me. If I do not hear of him before post time, I shall proceed. I shall not allow him one single moment's respite. The terms upon which I have offered to settle shall only stand for the day, and if he do not submit, as I know he cannot, we shall get more out of him. This is the way to move ; we shall get more in a day than you will get in a year.\" Yes, they will get more in a day than can be got by honest means in a year. But how much sorrow will depress their victims, and how many hearts will retire into solitude to break ? \" Ha, ha,\" said Mr. Levy, \"you are the man to get the money. You will proceed ; you will show no lenity. We will have the money, or mine God I we will do what we will do.\" \" There is nothing like money lending to get money by,\" said Mr. Goader. \" Let a man have your money, and it gives you such a hold over him ; in trade you have to watch everything as it happens, or you lose halfpennies"], [236, "228 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and pennies every moment, and they soon make a large sum ; or your workman is watching you, and making himself acquainted with your habits, that he may take opportunities to skulk and waste the time you pay for ; or if he be a piece-worker, that he may scamp his work ; or if you deal as you do, Mr. Levy, every opportunity is taken to put inferior goods upon you ; and, in self-defence, you must treat everybody as a rogue until you find them out ; and when you find them out you must not alter your treatment, but lend money, and you may go to sleep until the time comes when your interest or your principal is to be paid. You have then to wake up and receive it, and then you may go to sleep again, and thus enjoy life.\" \" Ha 1\" said Mr. Levy, \" and may be as happy as a dormouse ; wake up to eat, then go to sleep agaiu.\" \" No trouble,\" continued Mr. Goader, \"no anxiety; you have nothing to do but to eat and sleep. Lend your money out, Mr. Levy ; lend your money out. If you have any trouble, or apprehension even, come to me; throw them upon me, as if you were casting your burdens upon the Lord. Never mind the expenses, the borrower must pay them. You go to sleep and be happy : that is the life to lead. Your fortune will grow then like a crop of wheat, whether you sleep or wake.\" \" You say right, Mr. Goader, it is the way to get money ; it breeds fast, like mites in a cheese, and becomes the fattest where there is tbe most rottenness.\" \" Yes,\" said Mr. Goader, following out the same image ; \"but you must shift your quarter ou to a new cheese before the other is all consumed, or you will go to the board and be done for.\" \" Ha, ha, ha ! \" laughed Mr. Levy, \" as soon as it becomes waxy and sticky, leave it for a better.\" \" That is the way,\" said Mr. Goader, \" tbe only wise way. Undermine the house, but before it falls take away your money bags and undermine another.\" During this conversation the lawyer was carefully playing out his next game ; he knew the Jew had money to lend ; he also knew that he himself had a client by whom, if he could get the Jew to lend him some money, he would be able to make great gain, and he was cautiously preparing the way for the loan he desired ; if he made but one slip he knew that all which he had done would go for nothing ; therefore was he cautiously working his way. He expected that Mr. Levy would be so won by his reasoning as to propose to him to seek"], [237, "ANGLING. 229 an opportunity of investment, that, he might seem to be serving him ; but as Mr. Levy did not offer, he said, \" I have got a client, a very worthy fellow, a very worthy fellow indeed, as honest as the day ; he has a trade by which he has been getting money fast ; he is a clever fellow ; everything to which he puts his hand seems to succeed, he is so lucky. It is the way with some men, they seem to have the power of turning every thing they touch into gold. It is upon men like them upon which the prosperity of the country depends. Lock up your gold in your safe, and what does it do ? Nothing, absolutely nothing ; unless it be gradually and imperceptibly wasted. But lend it to these clever, speculative, plucky fellows, and they make it breed as fast as rabbits. I really do not know what the moneyed classes would do if it were not for these men. There would be no em ployment for money ; it would therefore soon waste. But let some of these men have it, and they soon make it more. It is from them our wealthy classes are recruited ; they are the very bone and sinew of the land \u2014 nature's gentlemen, the creators of all the wealth with which this country and other countries are endowed. Indeed I may say it is upon the assistance such men obtain whether the nation is prosperous or not. Now my client is extending his trade ; he is an immensely clever and plucky fellow ; he will let no opportunity of getting money pass him ; and his judgment is so sound that he never fails. Ou the con trary, he succeeds with everything. To give you an idea of his tact and management, the panic through which we are passing has not interrupted his trade at all. He is not the man to put large ventures in one place. But what do you think he has done ? It is just like him \u2014 just.

This is the way he does it : he hears of good bargains, or of people in difficulties ; he takes the money in his hand, and he buys the articles at his own price.

CHAPTER XXXV. A TENDER. Did you ever listen when twilight had just died away into night to the strains of distant music, and experience the delight that a succession of sweet sounds can give? \u2014 a delight which is not a spirit stirred with exhilaration, but a spirit lifted above the world and its ways. Have you felt a pleasure in the contemplative melancholy which the hour and the ebbing and the flowing melody produced? Have you observed that even those merry notes which lead the young and the innocent through the enchantments of the dance seem to leave their joy there, and carry away to the distant ear, which is listening in contemplation, all and the only sadness they contain ? Have you asked yourself the question, did the musician, when he poured forth those witching strains, feel the pensiveness their sweet melody excites? Did he, in the merry moods in which he created the joyous music of the dance, feel that tenderness and sorrow which falls upon the ear of the distant listener ? Or is it but the taint of sadness, without which great deeds are neither conceived nor done \u2014 the sorrows and the travail which accompany the birth of all things ? Have you ever listened to the \" Requiem\" of Mozart, and thought not of its solemn and grand harmonies, but of its deep and overpowering emotions of sorrow, and asked yourself, did the musician pour out the sorrows of his soul in those sounds? or was it but the skill of an artist who never felt the grief which wails in his song? Have you ever tried those sweet airs which are the peasant's delight ; which pleased our forefathers when they were alive in the flesh, and treading the earth which now we tread, which come down to them and to us from a long distant past, the legacies of minds which are gone to that Being who blessed them with genius?"], [240, "232 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. Have you ever tried if, in the joyous boundings of those immortal melodies, there were the sad tones of weeping and wailing, the tenderness and the sadness, which are the nurses of true genius ? Have you thought that, though you may feel its spirit and under stand its sorrow, yet your feelings were but the faint echoings of the mind which conceived the song ? There are no words which can truly tell, no sounds which can fully utter, and no pencil which can limn the thoughts and the feelings which are the true fires of genius ; and there are none which can depict the sorrows of a broken heart. Unless the heart be broken to whom the grief is depicted, none feel the pangs of bereavement but those who are bereaved. When my father returned he was unsuccessful, as I thought he would be, and was very sad. He bad gone to see an old friend, one who had attained an independent position, and had retired that he might enjoy life. He had been the whole of his life in business, with a mind fully occupied. When in the struggle for independency he had frequently been assisted by my father, and upon all occasions had expressed his deep gratitude for that assistance ; but as he became rich, and was enabled to do without assistance, his visits were less frequent, and at last entirely ceased. My father thought, now he was pressed, that he would ask him for help, in return for help formerly given. He felt very humiliated when he had to ask the question, but much more so when he was refused with many excuses. It was degrading enough to be compelled to ask a return for former favours, but very degrading when he saw the patronising airs his former friend assumed, and heard the many and copious expres sions of regret he was so profuse in making, as if he felt a pleasure in my father's distress, and delighted to linger upon the sorrows of the \" poor man,\" as he repeatedly called my father. Now, my father was a man who would rather have another's envy than his pity, and when friendship degenerated into com miseration he would turn his back upon it, and try and forget the degeneration. I have said that my father's friend had retired from business for the purpose of enjoying the remainder of life. It is not in the current of my narrative to describe how he enjoyed life, but per haps the digression will be forgiven."], [241, "A TENDER. 233 At first the leisure which Mr. Kufhall enjoyed charmed him by its novelty. The little occupation in arranging his nick-nacks, and his tools, aud attending his garden, so amused him as to prevent his new-found leisure being tedious. The opulent idle ness of an industrious man soon became tiresome. The little work the hands had to do ceased to please, and as the mind was entirely vacant, a fidgety querulousness stole upon him, and there was no dignity in his enjoyment. When these little pleasures were pleasures no longer, as was soon the case, he would get up from his seat and kick the cat, which lay upon the hearth-rug, from one side to the other. He would sigh and grieve, lie in bed late in the morning, and would apologise for so doing by saying that he had nothing to do, and might as well lie in bed as get up to sit moping in his chair ; he could not sleep in the night, and therefore slept in the morning, being the only time he could get a wink, then it was only a doze \u2014 a good, sound, forgetful sleep he had none. He ought not to expect it ; he dozed in the day, in fact was continually dozing, or sighing with a heigho. He tried to obtain amusement from scandal, but all the scandal in the neighbourhood was not sufficient to keep his attention alive, so that he became very querulous, and was continually kicking the cat ; so much so that the cat had a very wretched life of it. One day his son-in-law said, \" How our old chap does kick that cat about ; it is shameful. I wonder she does not tun away; if cats were not so fond of home, she would have done so long ago.\" \" He does ill-use her very much indeed,\" said his son; \" but there is no use speaking about it, he only the more ill-uses her. I wish some one would take her away, for it is painful to see her so ill-used.\" \" So do I ; but you had better not cross him, for if you do you will have no place in his will.\" \" But,\" said his son-in-law, \" could we not quietly take her away, and not let him know anything at all about it ? Perhaps he would be in better temper if the cat were not there to annoy him.\" So it was arranged that the cat should be taken away without his knowledge. When she was gone she was soon missed. He rang the bell. \"Mary,\" said he, \"have you seen anything of the cat ?\" \" I have not, Sir.\" He began calling \" Puss, puss, puss,\" down stairs, and \" Puss, puss, puss,\" up stairs, and \" Puss, puss, puss,\" in the yard, and in the garden ; and he"], [242, "234 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. called \" Puss, puss, puss,\" everywhere. He called in his neigh bour's garden, \" Puss, puss, puss.\" He asked the milkman, had he seen his \" Puss, puss, puss?\" the butcher, did he know any thing of Pussy? Was she shut up in any of the drawers ; had she been heard to mew; what could have become of her? Had she been sent to the wash with the dirty linen, and was she scalded in the boiling suds ? You must know something about her. Who had got a tom-cat in the neighbourhood ? Had she gone a-courting ? So he sent to the owner of every tom-cat within a quarter of a mile of his house, to know if they had heard any cats making declarations of love, and was his one of them ? and though Mary learned that there had been many cats making, as she said, \"demonstrations\" of love, yet they were in the night, and it could not be told whose they were. A reward was offered for the cat, and every one was asked about the cat, but all in vain. Miss Pussy was lost. The sleep ing companion who could doze as well as himself was gone. But what was the consequence? He became ill-tempered with every one. Nothing that was done or said was right. It seemed that if he bad not got the cat to kick he would kick some one else. Mary said she could not live with the old master, he had be come so very ill-tempered ; the place was miserable, and she would leave it ; she would not stop any longer to have her life worried out of her by such a crusty old man. The son, seeing that a rebellion had sprung up in the household, thought at first of reading the Riot Act, and give Mary notice to go at once ; but she knew the old man's ways so well, it was thought better, at a family consultation, to exhibit articles of peace in the shape of wages ; but this would not satisfy her. So it was proposed to bring the cat back again, and let him vent his ill-humour in kick ing her ; for if they did not he would kick somebody else who was less willing to receive it. Thus did my father's friend enjoy his wealth, by getting up now and then from his arm chair to kick the cat off the hearth rug. Pray, Sir, do you know any re tired tradesman who is enjoying his money by grumbling from morning to night\u2014 cannot eat, cannot sleep, cannot take wine, the wine merchants doctor it so, and it goes sour on the stomach ; nothing is right, and he is uneasy and miserable?

It is better to kick a cat than a Christian. But if you are an old \u2014 I beg your pardon, I have no intention to offend \u2014 an elderly gentleman, and been iu the habit of kicking the cat, leave it off, and do learn to be better tempered ; you will be much happier, I assure you. \" Ugh ! you mind your own business, and let other people mind theirs. Preach to those who like your preaching, not to me.\" \"There, now, do not quarrel because I give you this advice. Nobody can be so wise but there may be additions made to their wisdom. My son, my elderly son, consider thy ways and be wise. Leave off kicking the cat.\" My father was pleased that I had arranged with Old Joe for the loan of the money required to pay off Mr. Levy's bond. Old Joe had been to the bank for it, and had taken the precaution to have it all in guineas. \" You see, Master,\" he said, \" I have been told that he can refuse to receive payment in notes, because it is not legal to pay in paper money, so I brought all in gold, Master. I dare say, Master, the Jew knows the law ; and, as he wants to ruin you, Master, he would refuse any payment but gold. What a many odd things and ways the law has in it, Master ! It is like as if they did it on purpose. 'I hey tell me it is all made in London, and those men, Master, that they send up at election times, make it.

If bad times come, Master, we suffer first : it takes a long while before it reaches them. We, Master, have to be starved to death, while they have plenty, Master. I say, Master, the men who have to make laws which are to govern man should sometimes be hungry themselves ; then they would know how to put some mercy in the laws. When they have felt, as many a poor man has to feel, Master, how hard it is to be hungry, and have hungry children about you that are your own flesh and blood, Master, and that you are fond on, Master, and do not like"], [244, "236 UKCOI.I.K.'TIONS OF V Tli.V PK.SM A N . to see them starving, they would not be so hind hearted as ninny a one is, Muster ; but there would bfl I fooling heart in the bins.

They have cooks to make their food nice, and spiers to give it. a relish; but. Master, I question whether, with il, all, if it is as sweet us a crust and cheese is to a poor \u00bbm\\ hungry num. Master, there is one thing that always cheers me, and that is tho thought. Master, flint God blesses nil of us in His own way.

He looked at the money with a sigh ; he made no sign ; so we took the money home again."], [247, "239 AN IDEA. CHAPTER XXXVI. AN IDEA. The events I have just recorded threw a sombre and thoughtful feeling across my mind. I turned my back upon the haunts of man, and strolled through the meadows to look upon the face of nature, and read her story by the congenial melancholy with which the conduct of man had filled me. She was beautiful, surpassingly beautiful. The evening was closing around me. The kine were lying in fat pastures, lowing to each other in the minor key, as if they too felt the influence of the hour. The lambs were browsing by the side of their dams, or waiting for the stars to come out, that they might lay them down to sleep. As the dews fell upon the flowers they gave out a luscious per fume, as if it were their way of singing a vesper song, then closed up their petals for the night. The summer moths flew abroad, and the blind beetle hummed in blundering flight. The throstle sang his evening song; the horse \u2014 man's slave \u2014 cropped the grass in silence ; and the brawling stream kept brawling on, with an ebbing and flowing cadence. The poets say that as the day dies nature mourns, and that the dewdrops are the tears she sheds; but to me it seems like the maternal love of our great mother, who hushes all with silence that her children may sleep. When I went out, black clouds, edged with a fringe of glory, were heaped upon each other like mountains in the sky. In my wild fancy I thought them like the troubles of man, all black and dark towards the world, but on that side next heaven glow ing like burnished gold. They faded away, as do the troubles of man, and broke up into myriads upon myriads of little gold and silver clouds, as if they were a multitude of hosts surround ing the setting sun with grandeur. How everlastingly beautiful"], [248, "240 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. is nature ! Such scenes had been when the ground on which I stood was a wilderness \u2014 when those old inhabitants of the world, now only known by their fossil remains, were masters of the land. It was so when our ancestors, the lordly savages held sway. It was so when C\u00e6sar and his hordes did the work of civilisation by conquest. It was so when internal dissension harried these lands, and brother contended with brother in deadly strife ; and it will be so when all who now live and love or harry and hate each other are resolved into the elements of which they are made. For nature is eternal. Her subtle operations, which the philosopher by a refined analysis discovers, and by daring reasoning traces to the laws by which they are governed, have gone on through the long eternity of the past, though the men who then lived got no glimpse of the glory. Nature doth not display her grandeur that man, her high priest, may burst forth in praise, for now and then we get indications of effects of sur passing beauty, which man has always had the eye to see and the ear to hear, but by which until these days he had no suspicion of being surrounded. No, she carries on her operations for the benefit of her creatures, and asks not man for praise. As I returned, the moon had risen in full glory, shedding her silver light over the landscape, and pattering the stately elms and straggling oaks with pats of silver. Her light hid from view, as doth the sun those lesser lights which at other times bespangle the heavens, and she rode right royally through the sky, the mistress of the hour. The nightingale's song rang clearly, and from the chimes of Saint Martin's there came swelling through the still night that witching air, in all the harmony of sweet bells \u2014 \" My chra-ma-chree, my colleen bawn, My Aiolly ashtore.\" It was the hour for love and song, for sadness and sweet thoughts \u2014 the love which is to man a blessing, the song which is wedded to witching airs, the sadness which is not grief but an overwhelm ing joy, and the thoughts which hold communion with the works of God, as if they were living spirits conversing with man. Such scenes as these have been in the past, and will be in the future, for nature's ways are permanent and eternal. The harebell has"], [249, "241 AN IDEA. bloomed every year, never having missed a season, since God made his thought into a flower. The bird hath lived, and loved, and sung, built its nest, and laid its spotted eggs there, during a long aud eternal past, and hath not forgotten its ways. I have seen a little child taken by its nurse into the meadows, when they have been covered with tbe wild flowers which nature scatters there in such profusion; and I have seen the young enthusiast gather a flower and call to its nurse, with infantine wonder, to see what a treasure it had got; and the nurse has said, \" Yes, my dear, it is a daisy \" I have seen it run further, and gather another flower, with greater expression of wonder, and call agaiu to its nurse, and the nurse has said with cold indifference, \" Yes, my dear, it is a buttercup.\" The young enthusiast thought it had made a dis- covery, and in its simplicity believed the flower it had just plucked had never before bloomed, had never before spread its beauty to the sun. The nurse received the intelligence with indifference, for she had seen the daisy yearly, and thought there was nothing wonderful in that. Yes, and if the nurse's life had stretched back into the infancy of time, she could have borne testimony that it came yearly, and never missed its season ; for nature's laws are eternal. I have seen a child of larger growth, whom the world calls a philosopher, go into nature's field and discover a law, as the child did a daisy, and make as much cackling as did the child, as if he had been watching God, and had discovered his secret as soon as He dropped it ; and I have thought that that law had lain there for countless ages, and that man had passed by it all that time, and had not seen it. Though a book sealed to him, it was no new thing. We are surrounded on every hand by nature's secrets, and do not know it. Secrets! no, not secrets; nature hath no secrets. Man is a bad observer, and does not see that which lies before him like an open book. God layeth his ways before man, and waits until he is understood. .Returning by Mr. Mincher's house, I saw him carrying into his carriage several green baize bags, all of which were filled cut in bony angles. I thought it strange that he should be doing menial work, and that Mrs. Mincher should be the only person assisting him. So I stood in the shadow of a tree watching them, and wondering what they could be carrying. The mouth of one bag was partially open ; a moonbeam played upon its contents,"], [250, "242 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and I saw that they were silver goods, like family plate, which they were so secretly carrying away. I saw no coachman or other servant about, but all was being done by Mr. and Mrs. Mincher, a thing at which I was very much surprised ; for I knew that they stood so much upon their dignity that they would not put their hands to anything \u2014 it was \"beneath their position\" they would say. Their language on all occasions was interlarded with expressions of superiority, as \"this fellow,\" or \"that man.\" It was but seldom they knew the names of persons, but would address them with a \"here, you, Sir;\" or in describing them to others would call them, \" that man with a scar on his cheek ; \" or \" he who has a squint ; \" or \" that person with the pink bonnet ; \" or some other expression which seemed to say, \" we do not trouble ourselves about inferior people ; we are great, and it is beneath our dignity\" \u2014 a manner wliich I have thought a mark of au inferior aud vulgar mind, as meanness aspiring to greatness ; and, haying taken their dimensions, I have been more inclined to watch the comic side of their character than to acknowledge any superiority which their airs and manners were demanding. I must confess that such pretensions have at all times seemed to me the very perfection of the ridiculous, have given me more genuine delight, have more administered to my quiet feelings of fun, than airy other of the follies of men. It has been as delight ful as to see an exquisite on horseback thrown into the mud. I watched them carrying bags in until the coach was full. Then Mr. Mincher mounted the box and drove the coach away himself. Mrs. Mincher looked up and down the road, and then went into the house. There was no one about ; the moon rode high in the sky ; the sound of the carriage died away in the distance ; the watch dog ceased his troubled bark, and all was still. Alarashid, the historian, hath written that when Abilemah, the Caliph of Bagdad, saw that the children of the desert waxed mighty, mightier than the hosts of the Caliph, he loaded his chariots with vessels of silver and gold, and the golden utensils which the Caliphs of Bagdad had left in the palace, and all the precious things which he had \u2014 for bitter is the exile of a Caliph \u2014 and carried them to a place of safety, telling no man thereof. Alarashid saith that Abilemah was a wise Prince."], [251, "AN IDEA. 243 When I got home there was waiting in the house a man with an idea. He was quite unknown to me, and also to my father, but as he had brought a letter of introduction to my father, my father had him into the parlour to see what his idea was. As I entered he had taken a seat, and was about to introduce his idea to my father's attention. The first thing he did was to take from his side pocket a bundle of papers, all tattered and very yellow. He placed them upon the table and put his hands upon them, as if he were afraid that his idea would somehow or other escape if he were not very careful. I observed that he was not by any means overfed, either because he was so intellectual that he despised such gross entertainment as eating and drinking \u2014 as if he did not live to eat and drink, but lived for his idea ; or that poverty resided with the man of ideas, and he could not shake her off. His clothes were well brushed, but very threadbare ; and his feet were too small for his shoes ; yet he was not slip-shod. There were two round patches, about as large as a crown piece, upon the seat of his smails ; his shoulders seemed to stand away from his body ; and I thought that if his naked form could be seen he would not be far removed from a skeleton. But he was a man with an idea- Poor man, thought I, it would perhaps have been better for you if you never bad an idea ; you might then have devoted yourself to labour Uke a machine, and have been well fed. Instead of an idea being a blessing to you it has been a curse, for it hath kept you poor. I felt sorry for him, but he did not feel sorry for himself. As he introduced his idea to my father's noti\u0153 he was pleased. His eyes shone with delight. An enthusiasm would now and then break out in his speech, but he would check himself with a sigh, as if those bright visions had been so frequently disappointed that he was afraid to be happy, for fear that happiness should be as of old, the introduction to grief. Poor man, I was sorry for him ; but he was sorry for the world. He was a great man, and the world did not appreciate him. He was full of examples of great men who lived and died in poverty, but whom the world now holds in high honour. It seemed to me that he thought himself one of them. In introducing his idea he was full of digressions. A look, or a word, would cause him to digress, as if in endeavouring to bring his idea before the world many objections had been started, the"], [252, "244 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. effects of which he was desirous of removing before his idea was broached. Poor man, thought I, every mind to which he has unfolded his idea has started objections. It will be so to the end of the chapter ; some because they do not understand him, others because they do not like to refuse, some because they have not the means to assist him, and have not the honesty to say so, others because they like to show their own superiority, by discovering something he has overlooked. \" How much,\" said I, rather prematurely, \" would it cost to carry your idea out ?\" That was a question further in a negotiation than he had for some time been asked ; but he turned to address me, and after much preliminary and digressive matter said, that at one time, and that before he had so well studied the matter as he had now done, he thought it would require twenty thousand pounds, but from the great improvements now made in machinery he thought a few hundreds would do it. If he were as young as me he could hope to make a fortune by it. \" Have you,\" said my father, \" had the opinion of any scientific men on your idea ?\" At this question he turned over his papers, picked one out, and held it between his finger and thumb, and gaye a long digressive introduction to that paper. I did not see any mark or writing on his papers, but he had used them so long, and so frequently, that although they seemed alike, he knew the identity of every one of them. My father attempted to take the paper to look at it, but with a gentle bend of the wrist he drew it to himself ; he had not removed all the objections he had heard against that paper which he thought my father would raise, as others had ; he carefully and tenderly unfolded the letter. I was afraid it would tumble to pieces as he did so. He held it so that my father could not see the writing, for he was afraid my father should see its contents before he had sufficiently introduced them. \" Whose letter is that ?\" said my father. He bent it back so that the signature only would be seen, and showed that to my father. \" I knew him well,\" said my father, \" he was the leading chemist at the Lady Well Aqua Fortis Works, and has been dead twenty years.\" Then thought I, this man has been trying to bring out his idea for more than twenty years. No doubt when it first struck him, and he asked the princely sum of twenty thousand pounds, that he was wild with the wealth his imagination gave him ; now he only asks a few"], [253, "245 AN IDEA. hundreds. How are the mighty fallen ! He was once, no doubt, chary to whom he unfolded his idea ; but alas ! he was now willing to do so to any one who would listen. It was a charity to let his imagination revel in the wealth the world so unaccountably neg lected. After very numerous digressions he read the opinion to my father. I thought the chemist had not committed himself at all upon his project, for the opinion was very short, and contained four \"ifs.\" It seemed to me more like a kindly waj of dismissing the man and his idea than of giving any opinion at all upon it ; but he thought the opinion was of value, and being anxious to believe it favoured his plan, he did not see the cautious and guarded manner in which it was expressed, nor had he during the whole twenty years in which it had been in his possession. Poor man, thought I, he is self-deceived ; he is like all of us in things concerning ourselves, we like to be self-deceived. \"Have you ever,\" said my father, \"reduced your idea to practice ?\" \"ltrequires no practice,\" said he, \" it is self-evident.\" \" Then,\" said my father, \" what is your idea ?\" Upon this question being put to him he went into a long digression upon the different values of articles of commerce, in which digression there were many true and valuable reflections, as that the articles which had been used by the mass of people had always a large market, and as things became cheaper you brought them within the means of people whose means would not allow them to buy them when they were dear, and thus you were a benefactor to your race ; that by increasing the market you increased your own trade, and had the pleasure of knowing that you were doing good at the same time. Many remarks of this kind he made, and I thought that his heart was overflowing with goodness as he made them. \" But what is your idea? \" said my father again. Upon this he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and rubbed something between his finger and thumb, and again went off in another digression. My father's manner I saw was becoming impatient, so I said, \" Tell us what your idea is for it is getting late, or we shall have o adjourn the consideration of it to some more favourable time.\" He then put a piece of slatily looking stone into my hand, and said, \" Kub it between your finger and thumb. What does it feel like ?\" \" It feels greasy,\" said I, \" like soap.\" \" Do you know what it is?\" said he. \"I do not,\" said I. \" Then,\" said"], [254, "246 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. he, \" it is soapstone, and I propose to erect machinery for the purpose of extracting brown Windsor soap from that.\" Then he went into a long discourse upon the wealth which lay hid in that idea, and displayed several worn out papers, which contained numerous calculations showing the probable cost of extracting the soap. \" But,\" said my father, \" are you sure there is any soap there ? Have you ever extracted any ?\" \" No,\" said he, \" but it is self-evident, both from its name and its unction.\" \" If you will extract some and bring it to me I will see what I can do for you.\" And my father rose from his chair to end the interview ; but he still kept lingering on, and appeared likely to keep us out of bed the remainder of the night, so my father rang for the chamber candles, told Mary to let him out, and wished him good night. Poor man, he died with his idea, and the soap remains iu the soapstone. Will nobody form a company ?"], [255, "IS THE MONEY LOST: 247 CHAPTEK XXXVII. IS THE MONET LOST ? As soon as Mr. Goader's office was opened in the morning Mr. Levy was there. The clerks had not come. The woman whose duty it was to clean out the office had not quite finished her work. There was a quick and nervous fidgetiness in his step and manner, partaking of none of the buoyancy which characterised it when he was successful, or thought himself successful. He kept walking in and out of the office, looking over the curtains which divided the clerks' desk to see if they were come, and popping his head in and out of Mr. Goader's office, to be sure that he was not there. \" Your people are late this morning,\" said he to the woman. \" What time do you expect them ?\" She looked at the clock, and said, \" They will be here directly, Sir.\" He walked backwards and forwards, and looked at the clock at every turn. He seemed to think that looking at the clock would hasten Mr. Goader's arrival. He became impatient in his manner, and made a rapid noise with his tongue, like a \"Tut, tut, tut; how late they are! I wonder what can keep them. Mr. Goader has not gone out of town, has he ?\" \" Not that I know of,\" said she. \" Indeed, I am almost sure he has not, Sir ; for whenever he is going out of town he gives me some directions on the over night ; something for me to do for him in the morning, as if he would sure to be here. You see, Sir, he thinks that throws us off our guard, and he does it to prevent us having a bit of a run out. If we knew that he would not come, you know, Sir, our time would be our own, and we could do an errand or two for ourselves. The master knows that, so he always gives us some directions, like as if he was not going out ; then you see we know he is. He ha\u00bb not given any"], [256, "248 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. directions now, Sir, so I know that he is not.\" As she said so, Mr. Levy gave a look of surprise, as if the practice reminded him of a habit of his own, and the reasoning convinced him that he must alter his habit. It had not presented itself to him in that light before. He had no idea that the plan he had adopted to deceive, as he thought, his servants understood as fully as if he had said to them, \" I am going out to-morrow ; have a Saturnalia ; do not tell me, and I shall know nothing of your games.\" This remark of the woman determined him to alter his practice. At this time Mr. Twittles came, quite heated with ex ertion, and puffing away as one out of breath ; he took his hat off, hung it upon his hook ; he went inside the curtain, and lifted himself with a jump upon his stool. He placed his work before him, then wiped his forehead with his handkerchief. \"You are first, Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr. Levy. \" Yes,\" said he ; \" but I had a run for it. I saw the governor before me, so I ran round the back way, and I am first. I do not think he saw me, but his eyes are so very quick, there is no deceiving him ; he sees your shadow coining round the corner. Here he is. Eyes right,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Good morning, Mr. Levy,\" said Mr. Goader. \" WTalk in and sit down.\" He then went inside the curtains to Mr. Twittles, and said, \" Did you write last night in the case of Levy versus the jeweller?\" \" I did, Sir.\" \"Where is the letter book ?\" Mr. Twittles laid the letter book before him, and he read down the copy of the letter which had been sent. He then shut it up, and went into his own office. \" In your case, Mr. Levy,\" said he, \" I have thought it better not to lose a single point. I know your feelings, and what you want, so I wrote instructions to my agents to proceed immediately. We shall succeed best by striking hard and sharp.\" During the time he was saying this he was opening his letters ; but all that he seemed to do was to look at the headings, as \" Simkins versus Tomkins,\" then place them upon each other as matters of course. They might signify to the parties an immense amount of trouble and grief; but they only signified fees and a bill of costs to him, so that he placed them upon each other with the coolest indifference ; but there was one he read over with a frown. He struck it with his fore finger, then went to his ledger, looked at one of the accounts, apparently that belonging to the writer of the letter he"], [257, "IS THE MONET LOST P 249 had in his band, then said, \" Curse the fellow,\" and shut the ledger with a slap, and put it in its place again ; and he placed the letter by itself, as if it were to have his immediate attention. \" Yes, Mr. Levy, I thought it better to be sharp with the jeweller.\" \" Mine God,\" said Mr. Levy, \" he sent that old worn-out servant of his with the money late yesterday.\" \" Oh, well,\" said Mr. Goader, \" that alters the matter ; the step is useless, and the business ended.\" \" But I did not take the money,\" said Mr. Levy. \"JNor give him the bond, I suppose?\" \"I did not,\" was the reply. \" Then the business is in hand,\" said Mr. Goader ; \" but how was that \u2014 why did you not take the money ?\" \" It was late,\" said Mr. Levy. \" But the day was not out,\" said the lawyer, \" and he is allowed the whole day to make payment. Who was with him ?\" \" The jeweller's son,\" said Mr. Levy. \" Did they count it out, and offer it to you?\" \" They did,\" said the Jew, his anxiety giving way to consternation as these ques tions were being put to him. \" Now tell me,\" said the lawyer, \" as near as you can, how it was done ; there is no use in deceiving yourself by sayiug it was done in the way you wished it to be done, but tell me exactly ; I may be able to save you even now.\" Mr. Levy had suspected he had done wrong by refusing the money tendered, and now he found his suspicions verified by the lawyer's manner he trembled witb suppressed feeling. He was abject in the extreme ; he dropped his head into his shoulders, clasped his hands together, and pressed both hands and arms close to his chest \u2014 then said in a tremulous and hissing whisper, \" Is the money lost ?\" As he said so the pupils of his eyes be came round aud fiery, as are those of a beast of prey when the hunter brings him to bay in his own cave. \" I cannot say that yet,\" said Mr. Goader ; \" tell me how it was, and then \u2014 \" Upon this, Mr. Levy placed both hands flat upon the table, as if for support, and said, all in one tone, without the least modulation or inflection, \" The old man emptied the gold upon the table, counted it, asked the jeweller's son to count it ; he did so, then the old man pushed it across the table, and said it was mine if I would give him the bond. I told him I would not have it.\" \" Tt was a good tender,\" said the lawyer, \" and you did wrong.\" \" But there was no expenses \u2014 there was no expenses, and why should I receive the money when there was no expenses ?\" The"], [258, "250 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. Jew had, like others who have the misfortune to get into lawyers' offices, heard the expenses treated as of more importance than the principal sum. He, therefore, considered the expensesall important, forgetting that the priest teaches that the fatlings of the flock are the most acceptable offerings, because the fatlings of the flock furnish the priest's platter. \" Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Goader, \" the expenses, to be sure, the expenses ; they must be paid by somebody ; there is much valuable time lost, and time is money, and we must neither lose my time nor your money.\" The Jew again threw his head into his shoulders, clasped his hands together, and pressed hands and arms to his chest : he was the very picture of Hebrew misery. \" Is the money lost \u2014 tell me, Mr. Goader, is the mouey lost? \" \" You did wrong,\" said Mr. Goader, \" the tender was good; the expenses might have been left.\" \" But, Mr. Goader, is the money lost ?\" \" Now,\" said Mr. Goader, without answering the question put to him, \" I am about to take a step which is contrary to the etiquette of the profession ; for when an attorney is employed we think it wrong to see each other's clients, but Mr. Fireby is not so eager as he ought to be after his costs ; we lawyers like to keep our clients away from each other, for fear they should settle. If they settled themselves, Mr. Levy, we should have nothing to do. I am about to send for the jeweller ; perhaps we can persuade him into our desires, if not we must bounce him into them ; we cannot afford to be mealy-mouthed ; our case is not good enough ; it will not hold, Mr. Levy \u2014 it will not hold.\" \" Mine God,\" said Mr. Levy, most imploringly, \" is the money lost ? Speak one word of comfort ; tell me, is the money lost ?\" The Jew was very miserable. \" I cannot tell what it is yet,\" said Mr. Goader; \"we shall see more about it when the jeweller comes.\" He rang Mr. Twittles's bell. \" Mr. Twittles, I want you to go to the jeweller's. Tell him that I and Mr. Levy want to see him; you will bring him with you \u2014 we must see him. While Mr. Twittles is gone let me impress upon you the necessity of leaving me to manage the interview, and be sure that you do not display any feeling; for though the jeweller is a plain simple man, believing that he should do unto others as he would have others do unto him, I need not say, Mr. Levy, that is a doctrine unsuitable to a Jew or a lawyer. We should read it, do unto others as we expect others to do unto us, worse if we can. We"], [259, "IS THE MONEY LOST? 251 expect to get by every one we come in contact with. If we were to follow his maxim we should have to give to every one we met, which, Mr. Levy, is rather an exhausting practice; the till! the till, Sir ! would' soon be empty ; but, as I say, that though the jeweller is of another opinion, he may not always profess and act upon it; and this case might be the first iu which he breaks in upon his practice. He may not always think that virtue is triumphant in the end. If his faith should be shaken now, it will be very inconvenient. We shall have shown the teeth of the law, and gained no advantage, which is a fault, Mr. Levy, a great fault. We lawyers and money lenders should never bark. We should lie quietly sleeping in the kennel, until the victim comes within reach of our chain ; then we should pounce upon him, and all he has will be ours. Now, you have made this mistake ; you went to demand the money when he had covenanted to pay you ; it was his duty to seek you, not yours to seek him. Had you left him alone until to-day, he would have made default, and then he would have been in our hands ; our game would have been won, and we should have had nothing to do but to gather up the stakes. Now, I cannot tell you how it will be, Mr. Levy, One slip makes all the difference in law. If you once go wrong, the law does not allow you to repent and amend your ways. It will force you along the path upon which you have entered, even though you have been driven, or beguiled, into that path by your adversary. It will not allow you to return. The only hope for you is to dodge out of it by some bye-way. The law is a most power ful weapon by which to get money; but it must be used by the most skilful hand. It is professed to be made for the public weal ; but there is no law that ever was made that a clever man cannot use for his individual advantage. I must confess that our position is wrong ; but I will see what can be made out of it.\" Now it was Mr. Goader's practice always to magnify the difficulties of all matters he had in hand \u2014 to show his client all the rocks upon which the case might be wrecked ; and the practice had these two advantages \u2014 if he failed, he had prepared his client for failure; if he succeeded, his client thought more highly of his skill ; either way, his reputation as a shrewd and sharp practitioner improved. Mr. Levy was wretched ; he was the picture of despair; he had but the one parrot cry, \"Is the money lost ? \" He sat in a crouch-"], [260, "252 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. ing position, trembling like a coward. To all Mr. Goader's reasoning be could only give the wretched reply, \" Is the money lost ?\" He salt that he had no mercy for others, and he expected none. The mousty being lost, as he thought, crushed the soul out of him. He could have lost his wife and shed no tear ; his children might have been struck with a peslilence and he would have uttered no cry; he might have been left friendless in the world, but the loss of his money crushed and over whelmed him. \" Mine God !\" said he, \" is the money lost? Can not you tell me ? What a fool I was to refuse the money. I will never do so again. No, I will hold the money ; I will put it in my chest. It was you led me into this. You must get me out of it \" \" Me, my dear fellow,\" said Mr. Goader, \" I did nothing of the sort ; I should have told you to receive the money, and not to refuse it. How did I lead you into this difficulty !\" \" Did not you tell me to have goods off him ?\" said Mr. Levy ; \" to get into his debt, to make him pay the bond, so hold the goods as security for the payment of the bond and expenses?\" \" Well, ' said Mr. Goader. \" That these times were bad times,\" continued the Jew, \" that he would not be able to pay my bond ?\" \" Well,\" repeated Mr. Goader. \" That he would think the money I owed him would be a set-off against the bond, and that he would think himself safe, and not take any means to pay it off ; that he would thereby make default, and then he would be in our hands, and we could have stripped him ? Now, mine God, you will not say if my money is lost. Oh I am a wretched fool ! The money I have worked for, which I have schemed for, and which I have sinned for, is gone ! gone ! gone ! O mine God ! Gone, and lost !\" \" What need is there for this abject and cowardly outbreak ? I did say all that you have said, 'she plan was well laid ; we had only to work it out, and it would have been successful. But who was it who spoilt the game ? Did not you go to him yesterday morning, and demand the money \u2014 offensively demand the money? Did not you threaten him with your and my vengeance ? At the very time you should have been quiet, you take the steps which have spoilt the game. And this is not all. When a good and lawful tender of the money is made, you refuse it \u2014 you, a Jew, of all men in the world, refuse the money. You spoil the game, put your money in jeopardy by your own actions. You did not"], [261, "IS THE MONEY LOST? 253 ask me about them ; but, because the game appears lost to you, you turn round upon me, and say it is I who have lost your money.

Let me not be miserable \u2014 is the money lost ?\" \" Not yet,\" said the lawyer; \" do as I direct you, and there may be none of it lost. We shall come out with your money, if we lose the profit I expected to gain for you.\" \" Then it is not lost.\" \" No, it is not ; at least not all of it. Follow my directions, and we may yet win the game.\" \" I will. I will do as you want me I will ohey you. I will believe in you, and I will save my moneys.\" \" Now, Mr. Levy,\" said Mr. Goader, very seriously, \" I cannot consent to have the blame thrown upon me if 1 fail.

I have no patience with people who, if they do not win, say it was their lawyer's fault \u2014 he left a flaw in the indictment on purpose ; but if they win, take all the merit to themselves. It is a lawyer's duty to win, a lawyer's desire to win, a lawyer's interest to win, and a lawyer's intention to wiu, even though the victory is won by sacrificing all tbat other men hold dear. But, my good Sir, there are two lawyer's in every case, and they cannot both win. Failure and defeat sometimes come to my office as well as to others.

You know the reputation I have got ; and how have I obtained it ? By working for my clients without being checked by scruples ; by devoting my days and nights to their interest, and riding rough shod over their adversaries \u2014 ruining them, if necessary, and never blinking, relenting, or feeling remorse. I will do for you as I have done for others \u2014 my best; and I shall fear not what the world will say of me.\" Mr. Goader was not in the habit of speaking in this way unless he had some object to gain \u2014 to make some preparation for some unpleasant matter which it would be his duty to communicate. Had the Jew known this habit of his, his fears would have been further excited, and not allayed ; for during all the time he was making these confessions, he was lifting the letter he had placed on one side, and throwing it down, which the Jew merely thought an action to assist his argument, and not that the letter contained unpleasant matter which he wanted the opportunity to communicate. He saw a side of the Jew's character he had not before seen. He saw that he was a bully when he was getting money, but an abject wretch when he was losing it. He thought his heart was hardened and seared like his own. Tt was so when in prosperity ; but it was a coward's \u2014 a frightened and paltry coward's \u2014 heart upon the least appearance of adversity. When it came he would not meet it, but he would spoil the Egyptians and go into other lands, for he had no country he could call his own. Judea was not in the hands of the Jews; it was under the yoke of the stranger. Where upon God's earth had he a country he could call his own ? If the ancient curse still withered his nation, why should he, who had always been an outcast, fear to become a wanderer? Why should he, who had no native country \u2014 no seeling of nationality \u2014 care where fate called upon him to sojourn? If Zion could not be his, it did not matter in what land he hung his harp upon the willows and wept."], [263, "1AYMKNT. 255 CHAPTER XXXVIII. PAYMENT. Mr.. Twittles knocked at the door, then opened it, and said, \" The jeweller is here, Sir.\" \" Tell him to come in,\" said Mr. Goader. \" Good morning, Sir,\" said he to my father, in his blandest manner. \" How is your wife ? I was glad to see her look so blooming when at church on Sunday. Your son is a fine-looking young man, and promises to be a credit to you. It is a great pleasure and comfort to have a son like him. Take a chair. No, not that,\" said he, seeing my father about to sit upon one near the door; \"there, take this,\" and he gave him one of the easy chairs, and began to make much of my father. Now, my father did not like this sort of treatment; he thought it looked like bamboozling. He liked people to be open and straightforward with him ; to say what they had to say freely, and without reserve. Whenever he saw people making much preparation nnd fuss, he suspected there was something to be gained from him, and he looked upon it as so much craft, used for the purpose of deceiving him. Such conduct usually threw a chill over him. There was nothing he hated so much as craft. With crafty men he had to be crafty in return. He liked those best in whom he could freely confide, who went straight to the business in hand ; and disliked those who made a preparation, or preface, to all they had to say or do. \" Mr. Levy,\" said Mr. Goader, at the same time extending his arm to Mr. Levy to introduce him to my father's notice, \" this little business of yours \u2014 it is very awkward, very awkward indeed. When people take affairs into their owir bands, and when they do ixactly know what should be done, unintentional blunders an committed, ami affairs become awkward, very awkward"], [264, "256 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. indeed. In legal matters things should be done in the mode in which the law says they shall be done. As a man of business, I should say it docs not matter how the business is done, so that it is done; but you see the Government have prescribed certain forms in which the kinds of business we lawyers have to transact shall be done, and we are often thought to be formal and pedantic, because every form and pedantry adds to our bill of costs, and they certainly do add to our costs; but you see the wisdom of the Legislature has devised these forms as the safeguards of society ; and let me say this, that my experience in my profession has fully convinced me that forms are the safeguards of society \u2014 how, it would lead me too far away from the business in hand to describe ; but take that dictum as the truth. Now, Mr. Levy, in his imperfect understanding, hns misapprehended what the law required him to do, and has appeared to you, without the least intention on his part \u2014 as be has assured rue, nnd as I can readily understand \u2014 to be oppressive, when he merely mistook what was required of him.\" As he said this, be bowed his bead to Mr. Levy, as if asking him by his manner if he were truly explaining the case. This appeal by action, lather than by words, Mr. Levy under stood, and in reply said, \" Yes, that is it exactly.\" \" Very well,\" said Mr. Goader, rubbing his hands, at the same time throwing his head back, and taking u long inspiration for another start, \"very well, that being the case, you will make allowance, I am sure, for the misconception, and forgive any little irritation or distress it may have caused you. We are all liable to be misunderstood, and frequently give pain when we have not the slightest intention of doing so. You have heard that Mr. Levy had not the slightest intention to give pain or be offensive.\" At this point, Mr. Levy's admiration of Mr. Goader's tact and management began to revive, and be insensibly showed that it did so by rubbing his hands and bowing, in imitation of Mr. Goader's manner. \" Now, Mr. Levy, in refusing the money which your son and that faithful servant of yours, who has served you and your father for so many many years \u2014 a service which is creditable to both parties, the employer and the employed, and is evidence of the good qualities of both \u2014 I say Mr. Levy, in refusing the money tendered to biro \u2014"], [265, "PAYMENT. 257 and let me say that it was a good and legal tender \u2014 did not intend to be offensive or oppressive, but he merely misunderstood what was his duty under the circumstances.

Your son going to him disturbed his arrange ments, aud he, being possessed by those fears\u2014 Mr. lew will permit me. I am sure, to sav those foolish fears, which all who imperfectly understand the law have when they comr in coi tact with legal forms \u2014 thought that he might do something wrong ; his fears imtatt-d him. and he expressed himself wiih more WTinth than the occasion required, which he regrets \" As be said so, Mr. Goader bowed slowly and gracefully to Mr. Levy, and he gave a sort of an assenting and dissenting bow in return \u2014 assenting, because he thought Mr. Goader's game required him to assent, but dissenting, because he kuew what Mr. Goader was saying was all bosh. My father was watching the two men, and perfectly under stood them. The only one of the three who was deceiveo was Mr. Goader, and he \u00abras deceived, because he flittered himself he was deceiving. \"I have thought that, as this arose out of a mis understanding, the fietter aud the right way was to bring you together, and get the matter mutually settled.

There is much wisdom \u2014 much hidden wisdom \u2014 iu all the forms of law. I do uot wouder that persous of limited experience say that legal forms are made by legal meu for their own profit. There may be some truth in that remark ; but there is not uear so much truth as at first appears. Now. it is one of the forms that all deeds must be settled without any set-offs.

But Mr. Goader saw and knew this was the weak part of his case, aud, as my father was about to speak, he held up both hands for attention, and said, \" Allow me. Now. mis malter can be easily concluded by paying Mr. Levy the hundred pounds. I will uot press you for the expeuses. These are not times to ptess a tradesman, unless that pressure is unavoidable.

I should like to make you mutually friendly to each other, and, perhaps, a word in private may do so. Excuse us one moment.\" Upon this they retired into the small room, which, as I have before said, opened upon the back stairs. As soon as in there, Mr. Goader began talking very fast. What he had been saying to my father was said in a slow and persuasive manner, but when he and the Jew met together his language and manner was fast and more authiritative. \" There, Mr. Levy, we have saved the principal sum ; now I want you to fall into this arrangement. Suppose I can get him to pay tbe expenses by letting the bond and them be placed as a set-off against the ac?ount, will you con sent ? You see, he must have pledged some of his stock for the money he has, or have borrowed it from somewhere at an exorbitant interest. __Now, if we free that money so that he can return it, he may be tempted to pay your expenses. As the matter stands, we cannot get them off him. If we can succeed, you will come out of tbe difficulty first-rate. It will make no difference to you; for, if you take the money, he will be down upon you for his account immediately, and nothing at all will be gained.\" \"You may do so,\" said Mr. Levy, his faith in Mr. Goader returning in its former strength. \" If we should not succeed, you still will have saved the principal sum.\" As they returned from this brief consultation, they each gave a piercing but furtive look at my father, then looked straight down their faces, as men usually do who have just had a fresh infusion of wisdom. \"I have been telling my client how I think this matter may be settled to the advantage of both of yon. I see it merely required a mutual un derstanding of each other's wants, and there would have been no difficulty at all; none whatever. It is a very simple matter.

Now what I have to propose is this \u2014 that Mr. Levy's bond, and so on, should be a set-off against your account, and that he should send you a cheque for the balance. This, you will see, will end the matter, and you can trade with each other again just as if this disagreement had not happened.\" \" What am I to understand by the words, 'and so on?'\" said my father. \" Nothing but the very trifling expenses wliich have been incurred. They are a mere bagatelle, and are not worth a moment's consideration in concluding a business of this sort.\" \" Be they what they may,\" said my father, \" 1 shall pay none. There is Mr. Levy's money, and I demand my bond; and let there be no mistake, nor wasle of time \u2014 I shall pay no expenses.\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Goader to Mr. Levy, \"you see he is firm and stiff, and, I must say, a little wilful. What say you, Mr. Levy? Do you take the money, or what? The tender was a good one, and he answers your demand before you make it. What say you?

Ha ! ha ! But this is not Mr. Levy's count ing-house, and I suppose he only does business there ; so you will make your application at some other time and place. We wish you good morning.\" And he bowed my father out. My father left the office. When in the si reet, he turned to look at the window, and he saw the lawyer and the Jew both at the window laughing at him. The lawyer's laugh seemed a hearty one, but the Jew's was of the kind which usually ends with a \" curse him, we have got nothing out of him.\" \" That business,\" said Mr. Goader, \"is so far ended ; but I have received this very unpleasant letter this morning.

He cried out, \" Arrest him \u2014 crush him \u2014 cast him into prison, and there let him rot ! fut an execution into his house ; sell all that he has, and let him be a beggar.\" \"What,\" said Mr. Goader, \"would you ruin him?\" \" fiuin him ? yes !

It is a serious step, and ODe by which you are stripped of all your property. Creditors are usually very angry with a bankrupt, and say of him many harsh thiugs. The first Lea they have is that they have been cheated and robbed ; but whatever they may lose, the poor bankrupt loses all ; all, every thing \u2014 his property, his character, and his self-esteem ; and for my part I always advise him, when I am consulted, to take care of himself before the control over the property he has goes out of his hands. The world looks upon him n ith aversion ; the law strips him of everything be has : and for all that the world and the law care nothing ; he may die in a ditch, or rot in a prison. If he does not take care of himself, what is to become of him ? If he be an honest fool there is nobody believes in his boaesty; and, therefore, what is he the better for it ? I always advise my clients to take care of themselves : they will have the reputation of doing so, and they may as well do it.\" \" I have done what I can in that way,\" said Mr. Mincher. \"That I suppose,\" said Mr. Goader. \" Now I advise you not to secrete any property ; that the law considers a crime, when found out ; but convert all you can into cash ; make allowances, or any statements you think proper, to induce the people to pay you cash ; and where you cannot get cash get bills, or any kind of security : you will find all useful. The golden rule, when a man finds himself about to become bankrupt, is to take care of himself. 1 he law does not look after the cash, or other security, with the same lynx eyed scrutiny as it does after property. To secrete property is wrong ; to take care of the cash is right. We legal men never ferret out the destiny of a bankrupt's cash ; if we hunt it up too closely we may find it in each other's offices ; and to fad out among ourselves would be foolish ; very foolish indeed. We should be the birds who fcul cur own nests, and should deserve all the odium the proverb heaps upon such dirty things. The law is verv hard upon a bankrupt, very hard indeed ; it strips him in theory, and if the man be honest, in practice, of every halfpenny he has got. Then it requires him to pay stamp duties ; to employ an accountant to make out his accounts ; to pay court"], [280, "272 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. fees; and to employ an attorney to conduct him through the court \u2014 no mean amounts I assure you. Now if the man be as honest as the law theoretically supposes, how can he do it ? But this is only legal wit ; or humbug, if you like the term better. The law is made by men of experience in the profession ; should be by men of superior abilities; but I must confess, oftener by men of superior reputation. The ability, between you and I, the less we say about it the belter. We shall not correct the fault, we shall only bring odium upon ourselves : for let. me tell you there are none so jealous and vindictive as men of great reputations. I say the law is made by men of experience in the profession. Now, it would not do to insert a clause in the Act as follows : 'And, further be it enacted, that as the hereinafter following duties, stamps, taxes, payments, fees, outgoings, and other expenses will have to be made by said bankrupt, after he shall have been shipped of all property, expectations, contingencies, and probabilities whatso ever, the said bankrupt shall take care of himself, so as thereby to be enabled to fulfil the requirements of this Act.' I say it would not do to express this, so it is left to be inferred ; and it is so obvious, that the head must be a very dull oue indeed which does not make the inference. It is one of the unexpressed en actments, so many of which go to make up the law of the land.\" \" I hope,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" I have been sufficiently careful of myself.\" \" Of course,\" said Mr. Goader, \" I am aware, by what has passed through my office, of something which you have done. What dividend do you estimate there will be?\" \"I think you may safely say ten shillings in the pound.\" \" How much have you put the expenses at, which will be incurred in winding-up your affairs iu bankruptcy ? \" \"I have put them down at six hundred pounds,\" said Mr. Mincher, \"which I think will be ample.\" \" Not enough, I can asMire you,\" said Mr Goader; \" I think I shall more correctly estimate the dividend if I say it will not reach two shillings in the pound. You see your property is large, and there are many complications in it. We legal gentlemen shall all try to be in it, and we can make many more complications. We shall be able to bother the Court, and the Court will assist us by making as many adjournments as we may require. I feel we shall be able to keep you in the hands of the Court for nine months at least. You must not feel hurt ; and if"], [281, "273 PREPARATIONS. you have properly taken care of yourself, you need not feel hurt. We shall have no design nor intention to injure you : our designs will be upon the property, which will be in the hands of the Court. \\\\ e shall all require to keep you there to assist us in those designs. The property will not be yours, that we shall contend for ; but tbat of your creditors \u2014 men who will do and say all that lies in their power to revenge themselves. Now, if we legal gen'lemen appear to assist them, it is not to spite you\u2014 we have no feeling in the matter ; it is to establish claims and charges upon the estate. It will be a poor thing, if among your creditors there be not some fiery spirits whose vindictive feelings will afford us the means we want. If we call you all manner of names, censure you freely, speak to you, and of you, loud, storminglv, and use all the epithets and disparaging expressions which are u-ual on such occasions, you must not feel hurt, or offended ; we have no feelings of dislike to you; nay, perhaps we shall be doing you the greatest act of kindness by that apparent severity; our object will be solely to establish claims and charges upon the estate, and nothing more. I have told you this, so that you may not feel yourself offended or hurt. As soon as the commission of bankruptcy is opened against you, the properly is no longer yours, and you need not care what is done with it. You must not look upon it with the natural feelings a father does upon his child, and regret to see it wasted. You will no longer have any right or interest in it; and you must stand silently by, and let us have as much as we can among us. Now, ha>ing given you this advice, which is the re sult of much experience, I will call your attention to the state of my account. Can you pay it me?\" \"Cannot you get it out of the estate?\" said Mr. Mincher. \"I can do it upon this condi tion,\" said Mr. Goader, \"that you do not dispute it, be it what it may.\" \" That is agreed upon,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Very well,\" said Mr. Goader. \"Now, there is the expense of getting you through. Issuing the commission and all charges consequent thereon I can get out of the estate. I shall therefore not con template them; but there will be certain expenses in getting you through, and defending your conduct; that I cannot get out of the estate. I shall therefore require you to pay me them.\" \"How much do you think they will be?\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Well, 1 shall do them as cheaply as possible for you, as you have"], [282, "274 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. been a client of mine for some years. Suppose you give me one hundred pounds on account; if there is any left I can return it. But yours will be a case of great difficulty. We legal men shall be able to protract it, for I can see the means of making large claims. Your creditors, I am sure will be bitter against you, and that will be so much the better for us, our claims will be the more readily made.\" \" Well,\" said Mr. Mincher, in a de sponding tone, \"I will give it to you.\" \"Stop,\" said Mr. Goader; \" how is your credit at the bank ? \" \" They have spoken to me about the account,\" said Mr. Mincher; \"but they have not stopped it.\" \" Suppose,\" said Mr. Goader, you give me a cheque upon them for fifty pounds out of the hundred \u2014 say for fifty-one pounds, eleven shillings, and twopence ; they might suspect a round sum, but not an odd one like that. Mr. Twittles shall take it on to my bankers. Let me see, I think you bank at Dekay, Leek, and Co.'s ?\" \" I do,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Aye, very well, that will just do then. You can make it payable to some fictitious person, then there will be no suspicion ; aud if it be paid it shall be part of tbe hundred ; if dishonoured, you must find me the cash for it, so that will be all right. Now, Mr. Mincher, do you think you have got in all the money you can ? If not, I can put in various dilatory pleas to any actions which have or may be com menced against you, and by that means gain sufficient time.\" \" I think I have done all I can that way,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Very well. Then you are desirous of having the commission opened as soon as you can.\" \" I am,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Very well, it shall be done. Now, do you know any of the barristers on either of the lists ? Because we will not throw a point away.\" \" I have frequently dined with three of them on the first list, both at my own house and that of others,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Then,\" said Mr. Goader, \" I shall instruct my agent to have the commis sion issued to that list, if possible. Talk of purity and incor ruptibility ! W7e know all about it. If we are talking to the Court, we must make much of it ; we must tickle them a bit. But then, you know, we are men of the world, and know all about it. We can talk of purity, and incorruptibility, and all that ; but \u2014 \u25a0 Ah, well ; I am not going to say that if you were to go with money in your hands, and say, ' Decide in my favour, and this is yours,' that they would do it. That would be too barefaced ; but"], [283, "PREPARATIONS. 275 judiciously tickle them, speak highly of them, appear to defer to their judgment, indirectly throw scraps aud advantages in their way, further their family interests and family projects, and iu due season you shall reap the fruits if you faint uot ; the bias will be in your favour. The bias, you know, rolls many an apparently wide ball into game. What is the success arising from famdy influences but the consequences of bias. Let the ball be hurled to the right or the left, its bias will bring it into play. There was Mr. Gardener now, a stranger to Birmingham ; none of the profession knew anything of him, nor where he came from. He took offices, had his name painted on the door, and leaped into practice with a bound. There was no particular merit about the man ; if there were, he had not had time to display it. Yet he passed by older hands, who had been vainly waiting for years, with a run. The profession kept asking of each other, ' Who is he \u25a0 W ho is he ?' Before we had done asking the question, he was in full practice. The Commissioners were observed to give more attention to his pleadings than their merit deserved ; and when the subject matter was so near right and wrong that the bias determined it, he had the judgment. It was discovered he was the nephew of one of the Commissioners, and then the murder was out. Neither I nor any one else in the profession could say the decision was corrupt, or decidedly wrong ; but we all had that instinctive feeling which often leads a man better thau his logical faculties that the verdict was given to the advocate. I would not say any of them are corrupt ; but a man does not put off his human nature when he puts on his wig or wraps himself in his gown, or when he sits upon the bench and adorns himself in ermine. Human nature is of that character that it cannot be put off, any more than the colour of the skin, or the fashion of the countenance. You may attempt to hide it by a thick veil, but it is there for all that. It is one of the duties of our profession to watch these things, to find them out, and then use them for the benefit of our clients. A boy of a lawyer, just out of his apprenticeship, who walks as manly as he can, looks sage and solemn, endeavours to put the wrinkles of age and wisdom upon a face which is filled out by the roundness of youth, may issue writs, take out commissions, or executions, or any mere formal matter ; but this is nothing. The complete and successful lawyer uses the by -play for which"], [284, "276 REC0LLECTI0N9 OF A TRADESMAN. there are no forms or precedents in the books. If he have the genius, which is like instinct, to detect and observe them on the instant, also the skill and the fearlessness to use them, he is first in the game, and wins in the long run. Your mere boys know nothing of this, for all they wrinkle their fore heads and frown so \" At this point he rang Mr. Twittles's bell. \" Mr. Twittles, make out this affidavit, I shall want it sworn, aud be sure you put esquire to his name. Although the law does call every b >dy John, and Thomas, and Richard, and Hen-y, you 'squire them a bit; it cannot possibly do any harm, that bit of surplusage may be useful ; and do you not neglect any of those little touches, they give such an aitistic finish to the case. Well, now, Mr Mincher, there is that little account of Mr. Levy's ; he is a client of mine, one that I very highly respect. I want so lo arrange that he shall not lose.\" \" I do not see,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" that Mr. Levy has any especial claims to consideration in the matter.\" \" Perhaps not,\" said Mr. Goader, \" but it was by my recommendation he advanced you the loan I think, therefore, you should assist him for my sake; cannot you give him some of your household furniture as security.\" \" My household furniture is settled on my wife.\" \" 0, yes, I forgot that. Well, have you any accounts you have not been able to get in, which you can transfer to him?\" \"I have not.\" \"Have you any stock you can let him have?\" \" I have not. I may as well say I do not feel inclined to help him ; he is a grasping, over-reaching, avaricious man, and ot all my creditors I feel the least sorry for him.\" \"I suppose he has been hard upon you. O you must make some allowance for the man, he has a family of daughters, for whom, with a very natural and fatherly feeling, he wishes to provide. He is also a Jew, and for a long, a very long series of years the laws of the land have looked upon Jews as things to punish and illtreat. The child, when it first kneels at its mother's knee to lisp its infant prayer, is taught to loathe a Jew for slaying our Saviour, aud it is late in life before any of us forget the lesson we are then taught. We somehow connect the Jews we live among with the crucifixion, and execrate them as the authors of the punishment. We may as well connect them with the burnings of Smithfield, or any other of the cruel and useless punishments which have"], [285, "277 PREPARATIONS. been inflicted to repress the progress of opinion. Did it ever strilte you that there have been greater cruelties used to check the march of mind, as it is the fashion to call changes in opinion, yet none have produced so great effects as the crucifixion. Let me say this, as a lawyer, I do not see that there was anything illegal in the crucifixion. The evidence was complete and sufficient, and at the time, tbe punishment was that awarded to the crime according to the laws in force. It was impolitic, as all such punishments are, but not illegal. I do not, therefore, think that the Jews of our day should be punished, oi execrated, or shunned even, for what was done ages upon ages ago, and that according to the laws which ruled at the time. To allow this prejudice, this foolish prejudice, to influence us in our treatment of the Jews of our day, is absurd. Let me say this, in all honesty and truth, that many of them are excellent citizens, and excellent people in every respect ; and if you had my experience in life you would confess that the Christian money lender was far more avaricious and grasping than the Jewish money lender. Now I tell you how we will meet Mr. Levy's case You owe him a thousand pounds ; well, we will put it down as two thousands, the dividend upon that will, as you think, bring him out without loss. Now do not object to this arrangement, it cannot possibly do you any harm ; I shall consider it a favour to myself. If he has been harsh with you, show \\our Christian character by for- getting and forgiving.\" Thus did Mr. Goader, by that finished finesse of which he was so great a master, arrange for the benefit of his clients. Of course the creditors, as in all cases of bank- ruptcy, were the losers. It must always be so. The complicated machinery of the law has to be moved at somebody's expense \u2014 the bankrupt has lost all his own and much of other people's before he has the moral courage to become a bankrupt ; then, where in heaven's name can he have the means to do what the law requires him to do, but by appropriating some of his creditors' property to that purpose ? And from where can the Court and its numerous officers and attorneys, who settle upon every case like birds of prey, obtain what they want but from the same fund ? O, ye simple ones, who think otherways, I am sorry for you ; experience and losses are bitter lessons, but they alone can remove your simplicity."], [286, "278 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER XL I. AN APPARITION. \" My dear,\" said my father, as we were coming home from church on Sunday morning, \" we will go and see Old Joe this afternoon. I love to hear his homely thoughts ; they have a charm I vainly look for elsewhere, and there is a deep philosophy in his simplicity which we cannot find in the learned jargon of those the world calls wiser men.\" At the time the events happened I am recalling there was a narrow road between the gardens and fields leading out of Holloway Head to Edgbaston Old Church ; that lane was cahed Speaking Stile Lane. Many are the stories which tradition associated with the stile which gave its name to the lane; some of them are merry, and were created in the lighter moods and rampant fancy of the olden times ; others are shaded with the sombre hues of sorrow, and tell of broken vows and broken hearts. To me every spot had a story, and the moaning of the wind was as the voices of those lorn spirits who there had sinned and son owed. The wise men who then lived said they were all superstitions of the place ; the wild stories of wilder imaginations ; but to me there was and is a joy iu the most sorrowful story I have vainly sought in what the world calls wisdom. To me there is more pleasure in the traditions of the past than in all the maxims of the greatest sages. Begone, I say to the wise scorner, and rob us not of those traditions the old world has left. Is the garden better when all its flowers are gone ? Would Juno's birds be more lovely if stripped of their plumage ? Is the summer's evening grander when it dies away into night without a blush ? Or would the world be more charming if poetry were banished to the wilderness ? Let me beseech you to tread lightly when you tread upon hallowed ground ; life hath not so many charms"], [287, "AN APPARITION. 279 that it should be robbed of its greatest. The stile which gave its name to the lane was situated about the middle of Irving Street; words spoken there were re-echoed from the rising ground which now forms Lee Bank and Elvetham Roads ; Sandy Lane, now called Bell Barn Eoad, passed down the valley which divided the two hills ; on the side of one was the stile, from that of the other the echoes were returned. In those days, from St. Ihomas's Church to Edgbaston Church was all meadow land, garnished with God's garniture, elms and sycamores, and oak trees of ancient growth ; tbe sheep browsed, the kine chewed the cud, the horse grazed when his day's work was done, the hedge rows and the thickets were made vocal with the song of many birds, and the light-hearted milkmaid joined in chorus. Man has built himself houses there, he has covered it with a city, he calls himself great, he has cut down God's garniture, and it is no more ; the song birds have gone further afield, the milkmaid no longer sings love ditties, and the golden tints of evening glow not now as lovely as then. In Yew Tree Road there stand the remains of a yew tree. It was once vigorous and luxuriant with sombre beauty. It is now bald with age, and like a decrepit old man who is tottering home to his father, there are few who look upon the ruin who can believe that he ever was an athlete, proud in his powers and his muscular development. That yew tree stood at the entrance to Old Joe's garden and cottage, on the crown of that hill was Old Joe's home. He had used to say it was lonely, and the winds would howl about it in winter, but when he arose in the morning he could see the sun rise, and the rising sun was a glory to him, and at evening he could sit at his cottage door and watch the sun go down and the stars of heaven come out, the great ones, like the great ones of the earth, fond ot showing them selves first ; then the lesser lights, like the world's common people, not so brilliant as the great ones, but much nearer heaven; for Old Joe thought that heaven was beyond the blue arch and that the stars were the lamps which lighted up its portals. It was a vain fancy, as we all know, but I do not think he would have been a happier man had philosophy stepped into his cottage, and with iconoclastic rage scattered his fancy in ruins. As soon as you entered his garden you could see that poetry was a prevailing feature in his mind \u2014 at least if you are a person of ordinary"], [288, "280 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. observation \u2014 if not, I cannot say what you would have seen; perhaps nothing but a white-headed old man, and might have said, \" What, is that him ?\" The walk up to his cottage door was bordered with flowers, a canary creeper wound about his rustic porch, and others formed a bower over the seat where the old man had used to sit and muse. When we entered the old man rose from his seat. Our visit was unexpected, but none the less welcome on that account. \" Joe,\" said my mother, \" we have called to look at your garden.\" \" You are welcome, Ma'am. Will you sit down upon my seat and rest yourself, Ma'am ? You see I have planted canary creepers round it, Ma'am. I love to sit here in an evening, Ma'am, and hear the birds sing \u2014 the robin and the throstle sing the latest, Ma'am \u2014 they sing while the hen bird sits upon the nest, engaged in her family duties. I think, Ma'am, it is a lesson for us. Bless them, they are as God made them; they cheer each other with song, a\"d they were made to do it. Man should cheer his mate as the bird does. I do not think, Ma'am, that that God who made us all would give that pretty feeling to the bird and deny it to man ; do you, Md'am ?\" \" Well, Joe,\" said rry mother, \" I have not thought of such things; but I should think not.\" \" Master, sit down beside the misses,\" said Old Joe, and he went into the cottage and brought out two chairs ; they were straight backed chairs, with cushions covered with chintz. \" Master John,\" said he, \" sit on this chair, and I will sit on the other.\" \" You sit on the seat by the side of my wile,\" said my father, \" and I will take one chair and John the other.\" I do not think tbat I had any intention in the step I took, but I placed my chair by the side of Old Joe, and left my father to place his by the side of my mother ; as I did SO the old man turned round pud said, \" Muster John, I beg your pardon, but will you shake bands with me?\" I held out my hand to him frankly, and he shook it heartily ; it was a simple request, but I felt, as by instinct, that the old man deeply felt it. \" Master John,\" said he, \" I shall soon leave you ; I am old now, but I feel if I were to be called away this night, that my harvest would have been gathered, my garner filled, and my work done ; I have but to make way for other workmen. Master John, excuse an old man's freedom, but do your duty, Master John ; act"], [289, "281 AN APPARITION. rightly as far as is in your power ; you may sometimes see the wicked flourish, but there is always a canker at the heart, and they do not live to be old, Master John, as I am. It is not wealth that makes a man happy, Master John, but contentment. Isa man is contented he is always happy, although his drink be spring water and his meat a crust of bread and cheese. But if he be not contented, Master John, all the broad meadows which we can see fom the top of this hill,\" as he said so he rose from his seat and stretched out bis arms to assist bis idea, at the same time turning himself round, \" would not make him happy. He may loll in his coach, Master John, and have his house gilded with gold, and have servants at his call, and yet be very wretched, Master John.\" This was said more because he was pleased that I sat by his side, and had forgiven him for former disobedience, as he was now convinced, for the old man looked at actions more than words. Actions he thought the language of the heart, words the language of the head ; the latter might deceive, but the heart never proved a traitor. He did not say this because he thought I needed such advice, at least I hope so, but that my sifting by his side required that something should be said. After we had rested ourselves he took us round the garden. My mother aud he were quite at home together ; she very much ad mired his garden, aud bis flowers ; he pointed out their several beauties, and I must confess that I knew more about them, much more, after the walk round than I did before. 'Ibis book, which had been always open to me, seemed, when be read it, to have meanings I had not seen or suspected. My mother, like all women who are very fond of their husbands, set my father up as a standard and measured everything against him. \"You never saw anything of this,\" said she, addressing my father. \" You would walk through fields, through the gardens, and through a green-house even, and not see these things.\" \" You see, Ma'am,\" said Old Joe, \"we all of us have different hobbies; mine has been my garden, Ma'am, and tbe master's has been his business. When I have done my day's work, Ma'am, my care is over, and I can think of these things ; but when the master has done his day's work, Ma'am, he has still his business to think on.\" When Joe had thoughts to utter wliich were merely sentimental, he addressed my mother. The experience of a long life had taught"], [290, "282 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. him that women were more susceptible of sentiment than men ; when he had anything wliich was purely a matter of thought he addressed my father, but whenever he had any advice to give he turned to me. I was young then, and he thought that advice would be useful. After our walk round the garden, my mother and he sat upon the bench as before, and my father and I upon the chairs. He had a daughter who kept his house, the only child of a large family he had at home. She made tea for us, and we had it in the garden. At first my father refused, but Joe looked so imploringly that my father consented. \"You see, Ma'am,\" said he, \" that is the only child I have left at home; all the others, Ma'am, have, by the fortunes of life, left me. Some are at service, some are married, and some have gone a long way off, Ma'am \u2014 they tell me to places beyond the sea. When they were young, Ma'am, and at home, and my old wench was with me \u2014 God bless her ! \u2014 I used to think this house was like a nest, Ma'am, and that our children were like little birds. I left them in a morning to get their food, and when I returned home at night, you do not know, Ma'am, how happy I was. My old wench always met me with a smile, and our little birds came jumping round me ; but, Ma'am, she has gone to heaven now, all my little birds have flown, and the nest has but one in it and myself; but I have been happy here, Ma'am, and though the evening of my life has come, I cannot say but I am happy yet ; but if it had pleased God to let my poor old wench remain with me until the evening closed, I should have been happier. But His will be done, for I know it is right.\" \" Yes, Joe,\" said my father ; \" we cften repine, when, if we knew all, we should have cause to rejoice.\" \" Yes, Master, yes,' said Old Joe, earnestly ; \"I have not lived a long life with out knowing and feeling that truth. Ma'am when my old wench died she took my hand in hers, and said, ' Joseph, take care of the children.' Ma'am, I never knew a mother die yet, but ber last words were, 'Take care of the children.' Ma'am it is a great blessing that He who made us all has planted so much love and affection in the mother's heart, that her thoughts are always of her children. I have seen, Ma'am, the little bird, the timid little bird, whom the rustle of a dead leaf would frighten, fight for its young ; and, Ma'am, I have thought what a blessing it was that He who made us all had given the little thing the"], [291, "AN APPARITION. 283 courage to fight for its young. Ma'am, it is a hard thing to part with those who are dear to you, and when I think of my old wench I cannot help a tear.\" As he said so, a large one rolled down the old man's cheek. My mother shuffled on her seat ; my father coughed and blew his nose, and I looked at Old Joe in surprise at his depth of feeling. \" Ma'am, do you believe that the spirits of the dead visit the places and the persons whom they loved when in life ?\" \" I do not know,\" said my mother, \"what to say about it, Joe ; people laugh at you so if you say you believe in ghosts.\" \" Yes, Ma'am ; those who think they know so much, Ma'am, and are wise above the world's wisdom ; but, Ma'am, you should let them have the wisdom, and believe what you know for all that. Master, do you believe in it ?\" \" Why, Joe,\" said my father, \" it has been believed by all nations and all times, and I thiuk sometimes there must be something in it, though I do not know what ; either the moodiness of bereaved hearts revives memories of former times, and fancies they are realities, or there must be something in it, for the testimony of all ages must not be despised.\" \" This is the way I look at it, Master ; you know how fond a mother is of her sickly child, and you know what a hard fight it is for a healthy child, Master, to fio-ht the battle of life ; when the mother dies, Master, and her soul goes to heaven, by putting off the human form, Master, she cannot put off the human heart as well. Master, that is a piece of heaven which God gives all of us when we are born, and, if we cultivate it right, Master, we shall have to give it up to heaven again. Master, if the mother loves her sickly child she must come to see it, to help it, and to comfort it ; and, Master, it is sickly and fond-hearted children who always see their mother's spirit. To me, Master, heaven would not be heaven if, as soon as I got there, the memory of the past was lost ; and those affections which had twined themselves round my heart, Master, were torn away. No, Master, 1 could not forget to love my children ; the splendours of heaven might be dazzling and overpowering, Master, but I am sure of this, that they would not make me hard hearted.\" \"No, Joe; no, Joe,\" said my mother, as she wiped her eyes with her handkerchief; \"have some tea, Joe.\" As she poured it out for him her hand trembled so she could scarcely do it ; she put the teapot down, and buried"], [292, "284 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TIIADKSMAN. her face in her handkerchief, lor my mother wbh truly n mother, aud Old Joe's thoughts went straight, lo her houri and received a mother's welcome. \" Master, I have thought of it many \u25a0 time when I have sat on this scat, and have eeen the tun go down, wlieu llie sky was all blushes; and I have thought, Mnsler, of the people who lived in Ibis world, Master, n long, long wllilo ago; and I have been told, Muster, that they believed Unit, I here were islands of tho blest, where the sun went down l,o, nnd that that blushing sky was the margin of their heavens ; and, Master, I have been tohi that their sky wiih for ever covered with that glory ; and, Master, I have wished thai, I had tho wings of a bird, thai I might fly to those blessed islands, but when 1 have thought of ray children and my old wench, Master, I fell, that 1 could not be so scllish M to go there without them.

Human beings are more susceptible to impressions which affect them in classes, or as individuals, than to those which affect the race in general. Whenever a calamity, or an advantage falls upon one man, the whole of the class to which he belongs feel them selves more or less excited, and either rejoice or mourn as the occasion requires. Let a labourer fall from a scaffold, and straightway all the labourers feel for him more strongly than they would for any other man ; perhaps had he not been a labourer, it might for them have been a matter for rejoicing. Let a miner be buried one hundred fathoms deep in the earth, and straight way every miner is affected with a more intense passion (using the word iu its primitive sense) than is any other who hears of the accident. Let a sailor go down to the bottom of the sea where so many brave hearts lie, and over which so many wrecks are strown, and sailors feel more than a landsman. That which affects men in a class is more important to them than that which affects men in general, and the feelings of an individual are of more importance to him than those of all the world beside. The qualm which gives him pain excites in him a greater passion than doth all the horrors of the battle field. The joy which exhilarates him is better than the hilarity of all the world. Antony lolled with fond dalliance in the lap of Cleopatra, and let the empire of all nations pass into other hands. It was for reasons of this sort that the company which had assembled in the evening at the Eagle and Ball was more numerous than usual. There were vague rumours of some large failures which would affect every tradesman more or less, and carry gloom and disappointment into many a household."], [295, "287 RUMOURS. They were there to learn what the sorrowful tidings were ; as when the little bird sees the hawk about to stoop upon him flies screaming into his talons, as if fascinated by the eye of his executioner, so did they go to meet approaching sorrow, and learn what it was; but it was only a vague rumour \u2014 a shadow which foretold the approaching substance. \" Mr. Blunt,\" said one of the company, \" have you heard who this is who has failed ?\" \" Oh,\" said Mr. Blunt, determined to hide his ignor ance by giving a dark answer, \" it will soon be out, and you will all be surprised. I hope you have all done as Jess Watkins did.\" \" How was that, Mr. Blunt?\" \"Why, you see, Tom Allen went to Jess, and said, quite confidentially, 'Jess, I see you have Sam Grower as a customer ; let me caution you, as a friend, how you trust him.' Now, there is many a man fails in consequence of these whisperings one to another, and these kind hearted, confidential communications, as some call them ; but I do not see much kindness in them \u2014 there is none at all to the debtor, and I very much question if there be any to the creditor, seeing how often these confidential communications are no more than fears and falsehoods, the current rumours of the hour. But, howsomever, Jess said, 'Why, what is the matter?' ' Oh,' says Tom, 'there is nothing in particular the matter, at least as yet.' ' What need have I to be afraid then ?' ' Well, there might be. I have thought it right, as a friend, to caution you ; remember that !' ' 0 aye,' says Jess, ' I will remember that. I suppose what you mean is that he is likely to fad.' ' I do,' says Tom. ' How much do you think he will pay in the pound ?' says Jess. ' Well, I do not know,' was the answer. ' Do you think he will pay fifteen shillings ?' ' 1 should think not, or he need not fail.' ' Do you think he will pay ten shillings ?' said Jess. ' He might,' said Tom. ' Do you think he will pay five shillings ?' ' Yes, I do.' ' Then I will trust him. My price will stand that.' Now,\" continued Mr. Blunt, looking at all the company round with one of his roguish and humorous leers, \" I hope all you gentlemen have charged such a price that it does not matter who breaks.\" The company joined in a round laugh, and every one of them, from the grayest beard to the downiest chin, wished they had the power to charge safe prices like that. \" Pooh !\" said Mr. Blunt, \" you are such foolish fellows, you tradesmen are. The principle"], [296, "288 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. upon which you fix your prices is that at which somebody else sells at. You go to Sharp and Keen's warehouse, and old Keen says, when you tell him your price, ' Phuff ! I can sell goods at that price, and get money by it.' And you believe him, and you say, ' I am as good a man as him any day, and I will not be undersold by him.' That is, you say this when he tells you who it is who undersells you ; and he is always ready enough to tell you that, and, what is more, to give you an order at those prices. Now, you ought to have sense enough to know that these are factors' lies. If you sell upon any other principle than that of a fair profit, upon a fair and just calculation of the cost, you should do it upon the principle that old Hayman, the fancy steel toy maker did. He was a clever fellow ; he made a large fortune ; he was a tradesman of the right sort ; he died very rich. When he had made a new pattern he would hold it up to tbe light and look at it, turning it round and round, and over and over, and then say, ' I think some fool in Lunnuri will give me eighteen shillings for that.' That was the way in which he fixed his prices, and if he could not find a fool in Lunnun \u2014 but there are always so many there that you are sure to find them if you look for them \u2014 he made no more of them. '1 hat is the way to fix your prices \u2014 what you can find a fool in Lunnun to give.\" \" That's all very well, but the fools in Lunnun are not so numerous now as they were in those days.\" \" Old Hayman was one of the right sort,\" continued Mr. Blunt, without noticing the incredulous way in which the company received the statement of his manner of fixing the prices, \" old Hayman was one of the right sort. When he came to Birmingham his father gave him ten pounds, and sent him here to try his luck. He soon got money. His way of fixing prices was the right one ; that was why one winter's night, his sister had all her nephews and nieces round her, at the old farm house, where they all were raised. She was a maiden lady, you see \u2014 and old maids, you know, are always so wise ; they know how everything shoul I be done, how husbands should be kept in order, and how children should be reared ; they are always teaching the married people how to rear their children.

All their skill, and all their virtues, and all their transcendent knowledge is lost when they drop into the grave. I wish it were otherways. But, Aunt Beckey had the children round her, giving them good advice : ' You should save your money and go to Birmingham, like your uncle Henry. His father only gave him ten pounds. He was persevering and industrious, and now he is a very rich man \u2014 a very rich man indeed.' 'Aunt, how much do you think he is worth ?' said one of the little boys, in childish wonderment at his aunt's knowledge, and in great astonishment at his uncle's great wealth \u2014 ' How much do you think he is worth ?' ' O he is very rich ! I should not be at all surprised but he is worth \u00a3120.' Tbat was Aunt Beckey's idea of enormous wealth. But, let me tell you this, that he died a very rich man, and, out of gratitude to the town in which he had made so much wealth, left large bequests to our charitable institutions. That is the way it ought to be. When a man who has become very rich looks back on his past career, he will see some dark places in it which he would like to forget \u2014 some occasions in which he had pressed hard upon those who had the misfortune to be in his power ; and before he distributes his property among his relations and friends, he ought to give a handsel to God.\" \" Hear, hear,\" said the company. \" It he cannot make reparation to those ho has been hard upon, he may compound for his harshness by making charitable bequests in such a manner that his bounty may bless the poor for generations to come.\" \" Hear, hear ; that is well said, Mr. Blunt.\" \" Yes,\" continued Mr. Blunt, waxing eloquent with his theme, \" when I go into the halls of our charitable institutions, and read over the terriers upon which are recorded the names of the donors, I feel myself in the presence of the sainted men of the past, who have given those handsels to God, to whom, when the journey of life had led them to the gates of heaven, the angel of mercy pointed to the poor who are to be always in the earth, and said, ' Give to them, and be blessed, before you enter heaven.' \" \u2014 \" Hear, hear, hear.\" \u2014 \" The poets have said that it is the tear of the penitent which opens the gates to Paradise, but I am sure tbat when the man who has been merciful to his kind knocks thereat, the angels will not refuse to open them.\" \" Bravo, bravo, Mr. Blunt ; good sentiments, and well expressed.\" K"], [298, "290 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN.

THE ASSIGNEE Since the time the events occurred I am recalling numerous alterations have been made in the laws affecting bankrupts ; all of them were intended to be improvements, but most of them are merely alterations, others no improvements at all : the mere creation of a formidable and expensive machinery, which has to be supported by the creditors whose losses have already been sufficiently great. The problem to be solved is, how to make that man pay his debts who has not enough to pay them with. To create numerous offices to be filled by men who, like all of us, desire to get an easy, permanent, and good living, does not, at first sight, seem at all a likely way of doing it. There is, and can be, no other way than by gathering the estate together, and distributing it with the least possible expense. To appoint a legal tribunal, filled by legal men whose minds have been occu pied with logical subtleties and mental dilemmas, to settle commercial questions, and gather together a bankrupt's estate, in which there are no legal questions but what the legal men them selves create, does not seem a very rational mode of proceeding. Experience has proved that it is a very vexatious one to the bankrupt, and a very expensive one to the estate ; made more expensive and vexatious by delays and adjournments upon any frivolous pretence. Men who have lost money cannot be expected to be as calm as the summer's ocean when it is un ruffled by the slightest breeze ; and allowance should be made for the natural feelings they express. To permit any one to harass the bankrupt by repeated adjournments upon frivolous pretexts, to force him to mortgage his future exertions, or press upon the bounty of his friends to remove the opposition which oppresses"], [304, "296 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. him, is to introduce him into new difficulties in the future, and is not very becoming in the judge, whose duty it is to see justice done between the parties. If he have not discernment enough to see the truth through the blinds and pretences which the interested advocates raise, he is not the man to preside. If he sacrifice the interest of the litigants to serve or compliment \"my bar,\" he is unworthy of his office. It is but too frequently the case, that the opposition to the bankrupt is merely to make fees, or to squeeze out of him some advantage to his opponent. If he be an honest man, he has lost his all ; and why should the court assist his opponents to make him mortgage his future. That fiendish spirit which disregards every feeling wbich honours human nature, so that it may gain money, should be assisted by no man, and least of all by those who sit upon the seat of justice. If the poor man be honest, loose him and let him go. Poverty hath horrors enough without oppressing and punishing a broken spirit. The problem, as I have said, to be solved is, how to make a man pay twenty shillings in the pound who has not more than five shilling's in the pound to do it with. One would suppose that the mere enunciation of the problem would be enough to prove that its solution is impossible. But it is not so. The time has been when the law attempted t_> solve it by imprison ment, or by selling the debtor into slavery ; and now there are persons who think it can be done by the same means. \" I will punish you ; I will let you know ; I will oppose you at every stage. I will make your life miserable. I will raise every question the law allows me to raise. I will worry you to death with expenses.\" If the bankrupt have not the means of meeting this opposition, he may be heart-broken indeed. Doubts will be excited about his honesty ; and to excite a doubt is, in the esti mation of the world, to prove it, and he will have to run the gauntlet of every mau's censure. If he be silent, or have not the ability to meet the charges, the court will frown upon him, and perhaps preach him a sermon. If he be indignant at the charges, and express that indignation in warm language, the judge is sure to use the office in which the law has placed him, to sup press his indignation, and to give him a choice selection from the moral code. Oh I could pull such a fellow from the seat of"], [305, "THE ASSIGNEE. 297 justice, and say unto him, \" Come down, and do not caricature the law ; remember, it is the seat of mercy on which you sit, as well as the seat of judgment. The man before you is ruined, and it doth not become you to let your tongue wag in censure. Deal justice ; and if it must be so, let it be stern justice, but do not add to the despair of a broken spirit by hollow and inhuman sur plusage.\" If, on the contrary, the man has taken care of himself, has money enough to fight opposition as soon and as long as it appears, can carry his case from court to court, can employ the lawyer and the counsel in most repute, he is petted and accommo dated ; he is listened to with attention. No morality is flung in his face ; he is a clever fellow, to be complimented and discharged. At the time to which these recollections refer there were two lists, consisting of five barristers each, to which all commissions in bankruptcy were issued. They were paid by fees. They bad not, so far as I am aware, any office in which they carried on their duties ; but whatever attorney procured the commission, in his office the proceedings were conducted. I am not learned in such matters, I only speak of them as they came under lny observation, and feel conscious that I may have made some wrong inferences ; but as they presented themselves to me I shall speak of them, at least of so much of them as I or my father came in contact with either directly or indirectly. They then met in the attorney's office who took out the commission. Tables were arranged at one end of the room ; the commissioners sat behind them in the manner in which the disciples are represented in the painting of the Lord's Supper, as a very facetious and profane friend of mine used to say, only he was wicked enough to add, they were disciples of the other gent who lives in the cellar. When they were properly arranged, a young man came out of the office and said to the parties concerned, \" They are all ready, walk in.\" This you see was an undignified dignity, and was like, \"Walk in, gentlemen, and see the show.\" Now when the law was altered this proceeding was altered also ; a proper court is provided, there is a seat higher than the rest in which \" his honour \" squares his elbows, a little lower is a row of seats in which the different offi cers of the court sit, andJbelow is a square table around which the legal gentlemen, \" my bar,\" arrange themselves. Let me in"], [306, "298 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. passing give the devils their due. I have always thought them acuter men than any counsellors I have seen or heard. When all have assembled, instead of as formerly, \" Walk in, gentlemen, and see the show,\" the usher lifteth up his voice and saith, \" Make way for his honour,\" though I have not been able to see by whom his honour's way i3 obstructed, seeing that he hath a private entrance. At the announcement the bar rises; his honour comes in, gathering up his gown in front, like an old lady mincing it over a puddle ; the bar bows, his honour bows and frowns as well, and her majesty's representative looks round at the upper parts of the walls of the court. My first appearance in the new bankruptcy court was some years after it was established, and was one of pure curiosity. A Daniel had come to judgment and a Bogie helped him. Since then I have no experience of the manners and proceedings, and have no desire. I thought it of little real service ; a mere form which the law had provided, and that was all. There was evi dence enough at how much the officials laughed at their office, for the ceiling was stuck all over with steel pens and diolders, as if they had been laying wagers with each other how often they could make the pen and its holder pierce the ceiling and remain there. In the middle of the ceiling was a magnum bonum. That, they told me, was \"his honour's throw.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"that does him a deal of credit as a marksman, if there be none of the dignity of a judge.\" To me it proved more than the most profound logical treatise could possibly prove of the character for utility and for solemnity of the court. The first improvement made in the old bankruptcy laws was a very great improvement, a very great improvement indeed, so great and so profound that I have never been able to see the height or the depth of it, but you know that might easily be. So it might. Formerly the proceeding to which I refer was called \" opening the commis sion,\" but the profound improvement thereon was to call it \" opening the fiat.\" Now it must be conceded by every one that it was a very large stretch of wisdom in the legislature, aud those by whom they were guided, to substitute \" a fiat \" for \" a commission.\" That was a thought for which it was worth stir ring the minds of men, but I do not know in what manner it was expected to increase the dividend to be paid out of the bankrupt's"], [307, "299 THE ASSIGNEE. estate. Ah, you tradesmen, for shame of you j you have no other measure of utility but profit. If any proceeding do not show a good balance sheet you turn your backs upon it with contempt. You know nothing of that high toned mind, that Christian feeling, which sacrifices everything to honour ; which disdains to grovel among gold and silver, but soars to the higher regions of human nature, into which selfishness never pokes its nose. Fiddle-de-dee. The object and intention of a bankruptcy court should be to make as large a dividend as possible ; that end should always be kept steadily in view. It is vain, foolish, and nonsensical to look for, or to expect to find, the poetry of human nature there. It is the court of selfishness, and no other divinity can be expected to preside. No matter in what spirit or intention the laws may be framed, when men have their own interest to serve and no others, some way is found to evade its spirit, or to force it to assist that selfishness. There were not in tbe days when these events hap pened any \" official assignees,\" but to each estate there was a person appointed to perform duties analogous ; but no matter what was the time, there was, and is, human nature, human interests, and human passions to modify, direct, and control every law. That is the all pervading power of gravity, which everything obeys and nothing masters. There it is, has been, and will be in all ages, a superior power to which every other must bow \u2014 the element, the all-prevailing element in every com bination. Now it was the interest and the aim of all parties under the old law to appoint an assignee of the \" right sort.\" The assignee was, and is, the treasurer and the cashier, to whom all parties had to apply. The all important personage who had to collect and disburse the estate ; the one to whom lawyer and bailiff, and debtor, and creditor, and every one, had to apply ; the be-all and the end-all of the case. No matter what high sounding phrases some of them used, it all meant money from his till; no matter how meu might struggle and contend with each other, when his till was empty the contention was over. I remember well the first time this truth broke upon me. At first I thought it very funny, but I afterwards grieved that so deep a shade should pass across my imagination, disclosing scenes as revolting as any which are represented in Dante's"], [308, "300 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" Inferno.\" I have since seen the same thing in all men, no matter what their station or calling, and I have regretted that I ever knew it. In such cases ignorance is bliss. I have seen men whose duty it is to lead the people in the holiest cause, to teach them the highest principles of life, and direct them in ways undefiled by selfishness, contending with the most brazen impu dence and the most unblushing greed for money obtained from the house of mourning ; in some instances from want as well as sorrow \u2014 for duties, too, which they do not perform, and do not want to perform. Would there were some place, some little spot on earth, some islet amid the vast waters of life, to which a pure soul could retreat and forget the hypocrisy of man ! There was a little old man, wearing drab smalls, a waistcoat reaching to his thighs, and a long blue dress coat with gilt basket buttons. He had gray worsted stockings, and large shoes tied with black galloon. His head was bald, round, and small, and might be very properly called a \" nut.\" His eyes were gray, and very piercing; his lips were thin, and, as his teeth were gone, seemed retiring into his mouth, or puckered inwards ; his face had the appearance of a dried apple, a dried red-streaked apple; bis eyebrows were very bushy ; as he spoke he lisped, and whistled in consequence of the loss of his teeth. His laugh was a little, thin, merry laugh, ready for all occasions ; and his hands were always in his breeches pockets, though the lovers of scandal said they were oftener in the breeches pockets of others than his own. The attorneys liked to get him appointed assignee because he gave them no trouble, paid them the money, if he bad it, never divulged their charges, was just intelligent enough for the office, and was \"quite safe;\" that is, had no opinions of his own, and could keep the opinions of other people ; or perhaps it should be said, he was without opinions of his own or other people's. He was just one of those men of small intelligence, having faculties enough to look up money, take care of it, pay it away when it was asked for, and keep the uncalled for scraps, the remnants, and all the balances himself, without being troubled by the requirements of the decalogue, or any of the feelings which usually reside in the human heart. If he were alive now he might suit the office, for all he would have to do would be to take his seat in the Court, walk about his office with a pen in his ear, lose"], [309, "301 THE ASSIGNEE. the books and papers, receive a large salary for doing so, and say how much he was overworked and underpaid. \" Mr. Sticker,\" said Mr. Goader, \" I shall try to get you appointed assignee in the case of Mr. Mincher, who, I am sorry to say, I have been under the necessity of making a bankrupt. There will be two or three poiuts I shall have to work ; does he owe you anything?\" \"He does not.\" \"Well that does not matter ; I will get him to endorse a bill over to you, then, you know, you can come in upon the proof of that. This will be a complicated case, and a very profitable one ; there are sure to be many unclaimed dividends, and it will be a long time before there will be a dividend at all, so that you can put the money out to interest and pocket that.\" Now, Mr. Sticker was troubled with a cough \u2014 a very convenient cough ; he always had a fit of cough ing when he was expected to say something, and yet it was the best policy to be silent. At this poiut he had a violent fit of coughing, but as Mr. Goader knew the man and his affliction, he took but little notice of it. \"In re Darby,\" said Mr. Goader, in that heavy, sleepy tone which is peculiar to legal men when speaking to each other on business \u2014 \" In re Darby. I want some money on this account. Can you give me a check? ' As he said so, he looked down upon his papers as unconcerned as possible . At this question Mr, Sticker had a fit of coughing, between the several paroxysms of which it consisted he interjected, \" What \u2014 is the \u2014 amount \u2014 of your \u2014 account ?\" Mr. Goader turned to his ledger, and said, \" Eighty-one pounds, three shillings, and fourpence ; but give me a check for eighty pounds on account.\" Upon this Mr. Sticker had another fit of coughing. \" How many are there of you in it ? Let me see,\" continued he, count ing the names of the several attorneys upon his fingers, \" your self \u2014 Biteum \u2014 Sparrow \u2014 Fireby \u2014 Copperdale\u2014 Parker--Staines and Wormwood \u2014 and that young man with the red hair \u2014 ' \"Oatland,\" suggested Mr. Goader. \"Yes, Oatland. I shall want to see your bills.\" \" O pay me on account ; you need not defer it for them. I am really pressed for the amount \u2014 in fact I want it.\" At this point Mr. Sticker had another fit of coughing. \" No funds.\" And his face became so red with coughing that he seemed about to break a blood vessel. \" Mr. Sticker,\" said Mr. Goader, \" your cough is worse than usual this morning.\""], [310, "302 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" Hot water,\" said he, \"give me some hot water.\" The bell was rung, the hot water brought in, and he drank it scalding hot. \" Now I shall be better,\" said he ; \" hot water always cures me.\" \"No funds !\" exclaimed Mr. Goader, at the same time raising his head and looking Mr. Sticker searchingly in the face. \"No funds! How is thai?\" \" I have got between eight and nine pounds in hand, and the court fees are not all paid.\" \" Is there any more to collect ? \" \" None that is worth spend ing money about \" \"Let me see,\" said Mr. Goader, \"there are eight of us in it ; and eight at eighty pounds each \u2014 say eighty pounds \u2014 is six hundred and forty pounds.

Now,\" continued Mr. Goader, opening a cupboard door, aud showing a large collection of brassfoundry goods, \" I want your opinion upon the value of these goods. A client of mine, who is done up, could not pay my bill, so I took these goods from him for the sum of one hundred pounds. This is the invoice. Tick them off, and see if they are rightly charged.\" \"You have a receipt on the bill, I see,\" said Mr. Sticker. \" Yes, he would not leave them with out ; and as he had no money, nor likely to have any, I took what I could get.\" The two men ticked oft the goods with the invoice, and found them correct, both in quantity and price. \" Are they saleable goods ?\" said Mr. Goader, \" 0 yes,\" said Mr. Sticker ; \" I will take them off your hands at the prices ;\" and taking the invoice in his hand again, he said, \"what discount did you get ?\" \" Discount !'\" said Mr. Goader, rather bewildered, \" discount !\" \" Y'es, what discount ?\" \" There was nothing said about discount,\" said Mr. Goader. \" O!\" exclaimed Mr. Sticker, \" the discount off these is sixty-five per cent.\" \" Then I am done,\" said Mr. Goader, at the same time striking the desk with his fist ; \" and the fellow will go boasting at every pot-house that he has done the lawyer. I have got but thirty five pounds, and I have given him a receipt for one hundred.\""], [311, "303 COLLECTING. CHAPTER XL IV. COLLECTING. Did you ever observe that the sentiments which reign in the mind of man, like the passions which stir his physical structure, vary with his age. When young, those are paramount which move him to sport and pastime ; his frame is growing, and his mind is occupied by thoughts and desires which assist its devel opment. In the morning of life, when the dews of tenderness fall, and the dawn glows with all the fond promises of a young imagination; when youth is breaking into manhood, and the dulcet notes of love steal upon him with all their witching charms, his soul sighs away by the hedge-row side, when that holy star, which young hearts and dreaming poets worship, kisses the hills where heaven and earth meet. Then he realises the happiness of our first parents ere sin had furrowed their brows, and is like a flower just blown, a heart just opened and bounding with a new existence. Then enthusiasm is a blessing, innocence a joy, and sin a deadly curse. It is then the poets of all nations have poured forth their souls in song, and filled the literature of all times with rapture. It is then imagination throws her magic light upon reality, and makes the dulness of life glow with the grandeur and the glory of an evening sky ; and it is then fancy dresses beauty in more than half her charms. It is cruel to analyse the feelings and point out how much is unreal. Time will throw shades enough upon the brightest picture, and colours, which it is fondly believed will be eternal, will fade away all too soon. It is the season of poetry and love ; and poetry and love are the subjects about which his mind is occupied. But a3 life goes on, thoughts change ; the opinions of youth are called follies, the active duties of life bring another set of ideas, his thoughts are of beeves, of"], [312, "304 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. the loom, of the mine, of the forge, of the workshop, of the ships wbich do battle on the mighty ocean, or of men who set their squadrons on the tented field. It is then he seeks to learn the cause of things, looks back upon the past, and tries to pierce the future. It is then he thinks himself somebody in the world, and that it will be all the better for his advent. It is then he disdains to occupy any positions but those which stand out in prominence. It is then be thinks if fate be kind to him another niche among the world's worthies will be filled. It is then he is all aspiration and ambition ; and shame upon the man who would damp his ardour. As he goes further in life the cold and haggard forms of reality push fancy and ambition on one side. The world becomes chill, friendships lose their glow, ingratitude tears with its hated fangs, life is a fight, a selfish fight, in which each combatant is like he of the old fable, in which it is said a great magician had so studied all human arts, and made a compact with the Prince of Darkness, that he was able to make a man, into whose hands he placed a flail, but when he touched him with the Promethean fire which stirred his machine into life, the creature of his hands slew his maker, and flung his flail among men without stint or stay. For, as the fable says, the magicians and the Prince of Darkness can make all things which the gods have made, but they cannot endow them with mercy, love, or kindness, those are dowers which come only from Jove ; and thus doth man contend wiih man, as if he had never been endowed with tbe dowers of Jove. Then age comes on, the battle of life has been either won or lost, man turns his thoughts to another world, for this, with all its contentions, has been but an unsatisfactory dream \u2014 a vanity of vanities, an oft-repeated story, and a too familiar theme ; death knocks at his door, and to him the theatre is closed. It is true that one stage of life glides into the other insensibly, without any epochs, yet the thoughts which prevail in the middle of each stage are sufficiently obvious to the man of observation, and are seen to be suitable to the periods of his life. Men are but as scouts sent out by an army to gain information ; they who go into a land flowing with milk and honey report it a land of plenty ; they who are sent into the wilderness speak only of wild entanglements ; they who go into the desert return careworn and sad, for everything is"], [313, "COLLECTING. 305 barren ; each man's report is true to him, but not true of life or the world. For there evil commingles with good, and, Uke the cloud which throws a deep shadow in a bright summer day, adds to the beauty of the landscape across which its shade passes. These reflections were caused by contemplating the wide difference which existed between Old Joe's thoughts and mine. I was young and he was old. My thoughts were buoyant and jocund, inclined to seek amusement in the gaieties of life. He was thoughtful and reflective \u2014 ambition never seemed to have stirred him. He was happy with himself and his family, and as he became old he turned his face towards heaven, and all his thoughts were of the city to which he was going. I did not think at the time to ask him how he obtained his ideas of that city, but I have since observed that they were all of an oriental type ; the gates were of pearl bestudded with precious stones ; the courts were of marble, inlaid with gold, and the pavement was gold and diamonds lighted up with a glow as of the setting sun, but the sun never set there. The lord of that city had all the qualities of an oriental king, angels stood around his throne to do his bidding ; if he said to one, go, he went even unto the utter most parts of space ; if he said to another, come, he came and veiled his face before the dazzling splendour of the throne. I have often wondered since the old man has been dead bow he had obtained his ideas. Had I thought of it then I would have asked him ; but perhaps it was as well as I did not, for his ideas of that city were a great comfort to him, and I should have been the last to suggest that his comforts were based upon traditionary fancies. \" Joe,\" said my father, \" you and John shall go to Mr. Levy, for payment of the account I bave against him. If I go, I shall not perhaps be able to keep my temper with him, and to John it may be a lesson in tbe ways of life that may be useful to him, for I fear that men like him will be in the world until the great ledger, in which all the actions of men are entered, shall be balanced.\" \"Ah, Master,\" said Old Joe, \" that will be a grand day, the assize of all the world. Master, if we could stand upon a high hill, or rather upon the summit of a high mountain, whose head presses the clouds, and had the power, Master, to look from where the sun rises, and all round the world to where the sun"], [314, "306 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. sets, Master; and could see all of it filled with a great crowd of people, some of them dressed in scarlet, some of them dressed in blue, like the blue sky, Master ; some of them dressed in tbe colour of gold, and some of them naked, or tattered and torn ; and some of them, Master, with crowns upon their heads and ornaments of gold, laden with jewels, mixing up with the tattered and torn whom they bad trampled on so when they were in the world \u2014 for there will be no distinctions, Master, at that great assize, excepting that the judge, Master, will have more mercy for the poor than the rich \u2014 I say, Master, if we could stand upon the mountain, and see all this, we should not be able to form an idea of tbe vast multitudes of souls who will come, up for trial.\" \"No, Joe, no,\" said my father; \"but to this account of Mr. Levy's.\" My father was afraid Old Joe would indulge in a long discourse of his idea of the day of judgment, and what he wished to attend to was business, therefore, he said, \" But this account of Mr. Levy's, is it made out, John?\" \"I took it to him, when you told me,\" said I. \"Then,\" said my father, \"you had better make out another, and take it with you, for men like him lose the account, purposely lose the accounts and send you back for a copy, and when you return they are gone out on business; they play with you, and deceive you, therefore it will be wise to take a copy wish you.\" I made out a copy, as my father desired. \" John,\" said my father, \" your grandfather was desirous of giving me a lesson in collecting accounts, as I am going to give you, and he gave me one to collect ; it was a small amount, and he told me I should have half of it for my trouble. I went to the gentleman, and was ushered into a room carpeted all over, the furniture was of the most luxurious character, and the win dows draped with crimson curtains, the ornaments of the room were of foreign make, of beautiful forms, but very tinselly ; the gentleman had on a dressing gown of a chintz pattern, a Turkish cap upon his head, and Turkish slippers upon his feet, he sat or rather lay in his chair luxuriously recumbent ; he raised himself up to tap the ashes out of his pipe upon a tray, on which was an empty glass, with a spoon in it. ' Well,' said he, ' what is your will ? ' 'I have called,' said I, ' for the small account you owe us.' ' Who is us ? ' said he, with a foppish drawl in his speech. I told him. ' Oh,' said he, ' you are in a devilish hurry"], [315, "COLLECTING. 307 for it.' ' By the date of the items,' said I, 'you have had them six months.' ' Six months,' said he contemptuously, ' what is six months to a gentleman ? My wine merchant is twelve months be- fore he calls, but you jewellers are such poor fellows, you cannot afford the credit can you ? ' ' My dear,' said he, to his wife, at the same time holding the key of his iron chest by the bow, be- tween his finger and thumb, and waving it gracefully and slowly as I thought that I might receive the full impression it could make \u2014 ' My dear, go to the safe, and if there be enough change pay him ; I hate to be dunned by these petty tradesmen.' As he said so he rose, lifted up his dressing gown, and turned his back to the fire to air himself. ' Well, my dear,' said he, as his wife returned, ' how are the finances ? ' ' There is not enough change,' said she. 'Let me see,' said he, 'I think I shall not change any of those fifties. Let me see, and he thrust out first one slipper and then the other, as if the sight of them helped his cogitations \u2014 ' Let me see, have not I some interest coming in this week. Those people are confoundedly annoying that they do not pay my interest when due. Ah, well, if you are pressed for the money, call again next week, and if the finances are flush enough, I will pay you.' The next week I called as desired. ' What the devil,' said he, 'are you come again?' 'You told me to call next week,' said I, 'and I have called.' 'Next week,' said he contemptuously. ' Yes,' said I, ' next week, and here I am.' ' I see you are,' said he, ' and it is confoundedly annoying to be dunned in this way. Pray, Sir, does any one else owe you money.' 'O yes,' said I. 'Numbers, I suppose,' said he. 'Numbers,' repeated I. 'And pray do you dun them as you are dunning me ' ' They do not require it,' said I. At this he stuck out his chest, pulled up his shirt collar with both hands, and blew several times as if he were very hot. ' That is very fortunate,' said he, ' but I suppose they are common people, and your dealings with gentlemen is very limited.' ' Well,' said I, ' the gentlemen we have to deal with are generally very punctual.' 'Indeed,' said he, 'you are a very sharp fellow, will you take a glass of wine with me.' ' No, thank you,' said I. ' O yes, you shall, it is the wine I take when I go hunting, and I call it my hunting wine. Now as you are upon a hunting expedition, a glass may do you good.' 'No, thank you.

' Well,' said I, ' if I call again when I am going by, I shall call this afternoon, and to-morrow, and to morrow afternoon, and the next day, and the afternoon of the next day. I am always going by when there is money owing, and I never miss a call.' 'The devil you do not; you are a strange fellow, and must be very poor.' ' As for that,' said I, ' I always think those people are very poor who require so much dunning.' ' I see you are a low fellow. I thought when I was dealing with your father I was dealing with a man used to genteel society. Call again in half an hour and I will get change by then.' ' Very well,' said I. Now it would have taken more than half an hour to go home again and back, which I thought he knew, so I walked about until the half hour was up. I rang his bell, and was again introduced into his presence. He held up his head and eyed me from head to foot. He pulled his eye glass out of his bosom, threw it back with what he thought a graceful turn of the wrist, put it to his eye and took another look at me, as if he intended to take a copy of my dress \u2014 an inventory of all my clothing \u2014 and count the number of buttons I had got. ' Well,' said he, ' it is his very own self.' ' You told me to come again in half au hour, and here I am.' ' I see you are the very identical man; and how the devil have you been amusing yourself?' ' O,' said I, 'it did not take much to amuse me. I knew I was to be here in half an hour. I counted the houses on both sides of the street, observed how many had brass knockers, how many had bells, aud how many had neither knockers nor bells ; how many clogs I could see sitting on steps, and how many cats were sitting in the windows. When I have nothing particular to do I love to spend my time in the acquisition of knowledge.' ' Of useful knowledge, I perceive,' said he. ' Well, you are a very singular fellow, and you need not trouble yourself about calling again. I will send your account.' But I had to call months and months about it before I got it. I got it at last. It was a maxim of your grandfather's never to lose your temper when collecting money, but keep going on until you get it. Now, John,\" said my father, \"do not lose yourtemper with Mr. Levy, if you do, he will take some advantage of you ; either defy you, and you will have"], [317, "COLLECTING. 309 to get it at law, when you will be sure to lose some of it, or say you have insulted him and dispute with you about the insult, and so gain time.\" \"Yes, Master,\" said Old Joe, \"these men who think so much of themselves are alwavs in that way, Master ; they think themselves made of different stuff to us. Master, but if they are made of different stuff, Mastar, I wish they would show it in their conduct, and let there be less mean selfishness about them. I do not think, Master, that because a man lives in a better house than us, has tbat house carpeted, Master, and has it ornamented with the choicest ornaments, and lives upon the best kind of food, Master, that he is a better man than us. He is better sheltered and better fed, that is all, Master. But that is not it which makes a better man ; it is what sort of a heart has he got in his bosom, Master. To shelter a man betler, and feed a man better, is what anybody can do, Master, who has the luck ; but for a man to have true goodness and a feeling heart, Master, it must be born with him, and cultivated in ad versity. Prosperity makes a man proud, and keeps his soul at home. It is to know what it is to feel the want of sympathy that makes us feel sympathy for others. It is to know what it is to be iu trouble, that makes us hold out a helping hand to those who are in trouble ; and, Master, it is this which makes the poor so kind to one another. Nobody knows what sympathy is until they want it; and, Master, nobody knows what comfort is until their hearts are almost broken. Until this, Master, they are only words, and not ideas.\" \" No, Joe,\" said my father \u2014 \" No, Joe, they do not, and it is too much the practice of the world to be satisfied with words, to which they attach no ideas. Give the ideas their words are iutended to convey, in other language, and they do not know them ; but, Joe, you and John shall go to Mr. Levy's.\" We went to Mr. Levy's for the account. As soon as we entered his pariour, for, as I have said, his parlour was his place of business, he said, \" Well, what do you want?\" We told him. The reply was, \" I cannot awhile to attend to you, you must come again.'' \"How long do you think it will be,\" said Old Joe, \" before you can awhile to attend to us ?\" \" I cannot awhile to be bothered, come some other time.\" I confess that I felt inclined to show my teeth, which Old Joe saw, and he put his hand upon"], [318, "310 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. my shoulder to check me. \" But,\" said Old Joe, \" we have come for the account, and we shall look very foolish to go back without it.\" \" Wrhat does it matter to me how foolish you look ; I tell you I am busy and cannot awhile to attend to you.\" \" Well,\" said Old Joe, as cool as a cucumber, \" we will wait until you can awhile.\" \" What ?\" exclaimed the Jew. \" We will wait until you can awhile.\" \" Wait until I can awhile ! What do you mean by that ?\" \" What we say,\" said Old Joe, quite calmly. \" Then I shall not pay you,\" shouted Mr. Levy. \" Am I to take that for an answer?\" said Old Joe. \"Do what you like, take it for an answer, or leave it for an answer, just as it pleases you.\" \" Now, if you please, Sir,\" said Old Joe, \"you had better think twice before you give me that as an answer, Sir. Master will not be put off, and he will act upon your answer.\" \" Let him act ; I will never give him another order as long as I live. I shall have it in my power to put hundreds into his hands ; and I intended to put hundreds into his hands, but as he is so proud I will give them to others \u2014 to others \u2014 to others ; and they shall have my trade.\" \" I am sorry, Sir,\" said Old Joe, \" for that. I am sure master would like to work for you.\" \" What discount are you to allow, if I pay you?\" \"None. Master said we were not to allow the odd money even. We must have it all.\" \" Then I shall not pay.\" And he walked backwards and for wards behind the counter, at the same time looking down upon tbe floor. \" I shall not pay you. What, pay you all your account and not get any allowance for cash? I will not. Make me an allowance for cash,\" continued he, \" and I will pay you.\" \" Our instructions, Sir, are to allow no abatement at all ; and if you refuse to pay, to take the affair to Mr. Fireby, to proceed, Sir.\" \" Take it to him \u2014 take it to him ; I do not care that,\" said he, snapping his fingers, \" for him. I can have law as well as you can. I can pay for it as well as you can. Guinea for guinea, and note for note.\" \" Yes, Sir,\" said Old Joe, \"I am told you are rich, Sir ; very rich, Sir. I am an old man, you see, Sir. My hair is white, Sir. I have seen much trouble in my time, Sir, and a many very foolish things, Sir, but I have never seen a Jew go to law yet, or suffer himself to be arrested for debt ; and I know Mr. Levy has more sense.

CHAPTER XLV THE \"BAILEYS.\" Do you happen to know what is meant by the slang term a \" bum bailey ?\" You do not ? O what a happy man you are. Although it is quite right to have all sorts of knowledge, yet on this subject live in blissful ignorance. The law books will tell you that the bailiff was formerly a high and honourable officer ; but they leave you to make your own inference why they cannot speak of him now as formerly. At the same time, they tell you that there are bailiffs of liberties, ground bailiffs, and water bailiffs. There is also what in slang language is called the bum bailey. Those persons who are learned in philological enquiries say that the prefix is put to his name in consequence of the great use of that member in the performance of his duties. Those who have no acquaintance with him receive the mention of his name with a smile or a contemptuous laugh ; but those who have had the misfortune to receive his visits, turn their eyes to the ground with great solemnity, and think him one of the ogres of life. The unfeeling man, who has money to collect about which he has any fears, requires his services instantly, and complains of the dilatori ness of the law which does not permit the immediate use of him. In the old mysteries, wliich in the dark ages the monks had used to enact for the especial amusement of our forefathers, the good spirits and the bad spirits were represented as contending with each other, with passions similar to those which animate man. The good spirits were those which represent all the kindly emotions of the human heart ; their minds were as angelic as their persons ; the Maker of us all gave to them the round outlines and the finished touches of beauty. The bad spirits are represented as deformed persons, and the passions which animate them as"], [321, "THE \" BAILEYS.\" 313 revolting as their personal deformities. They contended with each other through the scenes of the mimic stage, sometimes the good and sometimes the bad prevailing, until at last the good were carried up by the celestials iuto better regions. The bad spirits were driven by old \" Hookey Ben,\" as the Scots say, but as we say, \" Hookey Walker,\" with the cloven foot, long fork, and the fluked tail, iuto the nether regions. There was truth and philo sophy in the fictions, disguised, it is true, in the quaint habili ments of the age. Things which are ugly we fly from as by instinct. We do not think a good spirit can inhabit a house fit ted only for an ogre ; nor can we believe that one which is evil can inhabit a tenement fit for an angel. We not only feel instinctively that this is true, but we know from experience that it is so ; for it is seldom that the jewel is unworthy of the casket, or the casket unworthy of the jewsl. This was especially true of the bailiff and his assistants who distrained upon Mr. Mincher. He was rather stout, wore a rough coat with pearl buttons upon it, and was muffled up with a red worsted comforter. He carried a large asben plant stick ; he walked upright and firm ; when he met a person he wanted to speak to he stopped him full in the face, and put his stick down firmly, with an expression which said, \" Here I am, Sir ; I'm the bum bailey, and you must go with me. Come, no non sense ! i want you !\" He was a firmly-built man ; his left leg was rather shorter than his right, which gave an up-and-down motion to his walk ; the left eye was larger than his right, and looked as if it had au intention to start from its seat ; it always disagreed with his right eye, for, whenever the right eye looked left, the left looked right, and whenever the right eye looked right, the left eye looked left ; and whenever the right eye looked up, the left eye looked down ; and whenever the right eye looked down, the left eye looked up ; they seemed mounted upon different swivels, and had been ali their lives playing at cross purposes. Any one could see that his person was a malformation, and it required but little experience to perceive that his mind was as much deformed as his person. His two assistants were as much deformed as himself. Both of them were half starved. The greater part of their food consisted of beer and tobacco. They were idle, lazy men, whom nobody would employ. Their idle-"], [322, "314 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. ness and love of beer made them take up with the calling of \"men in possession.\" One of them had a long thin face; a nose purple and red, like over-heated copper, which he could never keep clean, but was continually wiping it with a rag of a handkerchief which he gathered up in one hand, and when the handkerchief was too wet to hold, he held it out with both hands before the fire to dry. The perfume it then gave out \u2014 faugh ! \u2014 it made one shiver. His duties were disagreeable ; but the stink he made was sickening. He wore a bird-tailed coat, which years ago had been the property of some dandy, whose hips required, in the estimation of that dandy, a bird-tailed coat for their proper display ; but the hips of the second wearer \u2014 alas ! if he ever had any they had long since disappeared ; his clothes were patched and darned, and that by an unskilled hand ; he might be fairly summed up as a personification of poverty, idleness, tobacco, and beer. The other one's face was much broader from ear to ear than it was from forehead to chin ; his eyes were set wide apart, and of a deep hazel colour ; his nose was short and broad ; his beard was black and strong ; his hair was short and bristly ; his chest and shoulders were broad. He wore ribbed stockings and half boots, a round jacket, with large pockets, a plush waistcoat and corduroy smalls. He had been a prize fighter, but as he had made several crosses he could get nobody to back bim, and was therefore obliged to take up with the mean calling of a bum bailey. Mind he had none \u2014 he was only an animal. The bum bailey went to Mr. Mincher's house to take pos session. His two assistants walked on before him; they had both tried to wash themselves, but had left the hollows of their faces dirty, as if they were afraid that soap and water should do too much ; they had put on what they called clean linen, but alas ! for its cleanliness ; it was of the colour of raw sienna, or of dingy or aged flannel. They walked together until they neared the house, then separated, as if they had no connection with each other. The bailey went up to the door and rang the bell, then watched for the opening of the door, as intently as a terrier watches the hole in which he smells a rat. As soon as it was opened he slipped his foot in with a jerk to prevent it being again closed ; then pushed the door so as to let himself into the hall. As he did so, he held up his ash-plant stick, in the same"], [323, "THE \"BAILEYS.'' 315 manner as a constable shows the staff which represents her Majesty. As soon as he was inside his two assistants came, scraped their feet upon the step, and gave a short cough. He instantly turned round, opened the door, and let them in. The housemaid, who had opened the door, began to scream, the coachman and the footman ran to her assistance, and were about to serve a writ of ejectment upon the three intruders without the formality of any legal process, but the ex-prize fighter stepped to the front, and put himself into an attitude to cover the other two ; the bailey threw out his legs wider, stood more firmly, began to puff aud blow with the dignity of his errand, and frowned down all op position. He with the coppery nose wiped it, stood behind, and was very fidgety. \" We must see the master,\" said the bailey. \"He is not in, fellow,\" said the footman. \"Then we shall wait till he comes.\" \"If you want to see him, call again ;\" at wliich all three of them gave a broad grin, the bailey put his stick between his legs, and from a dirty greasy pocket-book produced the authority for his conduct. \" What !\" said the footman, \"are you the baileys?\" Upon this tbe bailey put down his stick firmly, and said, \" High ham; and these are my men.\" The footman, the coachman, and house maid ran into the kitchen, or as they were in the habit of calling it, the servants' hall, being a more dignified name than the kitchen ; as they did so, they held up their hands above their heads, and said, \"Well, I never!\" Now the servants, when by themselves, had used to call the master \" he,\" and the mistress \"she,\" for they were of opinion that they were quite equal to he and she whom they condescended to serve, and there fore declined to use any term which assumed that any one was superior to themselves ; but, on the contrary, they were in the habit of making sport, when by themselves, of any and every little weakness which he and she displayed. When they had arrived at the servants' hall, the footman held up his nose and bent down his eyes so as to see little else than the floor, and said, \" He ought to have told me that he was in difficulties ; I never was so disgraced in all my life. Have the baileys, indeed, where I am ! What next? I shall ask for an explanation as soon as he comes. He ought to have known better than bring this indignity upon me. This all comes of taking up with an inferior"], [324, "316 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. station ; I ought not to have left the aristocracy. 1 might have expected this, when I bemeaned myself so far as to enter the house of a tradesman. I shall demand my salary, pack up, and go. I will not be contaminated by any low- fellows.\" \" So will I,\" said the coachman. \" I see now why he was dissatisfied with the colour of his horses ; he wanted to get the money iu his hands, and I suppose we shall have to get our salaries how we can.\" \" He had better not refuse to pay me,\" said the footman; \"I shall tell him what he will not like to hear \u2014 disgracing me in this way, the low fellow.\" \" Well,\" said the housemaid, \"I am sorry for her. How she will fret when she knows : she is a kind hearted lady, and I am sorry iu my heart for her, that I am. To think tbat she should have to become a washerwoman ; she who has been brought up to thiuk she was a lady.\" \" Lady, iudeed !\" said Johnny Trot. \" Some people have had so little acquaintance with ladies that they do not know one when they see her.\" \" In- deed,\" said the housemaid, \" I thiuk I am as good a judge of a lady as you are. You know so much, you do : you think that because you lived with the Marchioness Pridewell ; but she was nobody. I very much question whether you ever kuew a lady iu your life. You think because you lived with titled poverty that you are a judge, do you? Before you set up for a judge again, be sure you have enough experience for the office.\" \" I shall uot come to you for a character,\" replied Johnuy Trot. \" When I am in want of a character I shad apply to a purer source.\" \" Hush, hush,\" said the bailey. \" Do not quarrel ; lend me a jug that will hold lialf-a-gallon ; \" and the ex-prize-fighter went out to fetch the first instalment of beer. He returned witb three pipes, two ounces of tobacco, and half-a-gallon of beer ; and the three men sat around a table, and began the duties of office \u2014 to drink and smoke. The bailey had one pipe, and one swig at the half-gallon, then left his two assistants in possession. Now, he was fat and well fed, but his assistants were very badly paid indeed. They had to eke out their pay by persuading tbe man upon whom they had distrained that it was his interest to keep them well supplied with tobacco and beer. A man is usually blind when he is drunk, but a man in possession is alwavs blind when he has a good supply of beer aud tobacco in hand or in prospect. It is astonishing how very acute they are until they"], [325, "THE \" BAILEYS \" 317 have received their supply. They watch everything most keenly. They do not seem to believe tbat the man upon whom they have distrained is poor. They think he has a large store of money somewhere, of which it is their intention to partake. As soon as they have received a supply, they say, \" You must not move any thing after tbe inventory is taken.\" \" When will that be.\" \"That depends; either to-day or to-morrow.\" \"Here is five shillings for you, and when that is gone you shall have some more \" \"The inventory will not be taken before to-morrow; perhaps, the next day.\" \" WeE, I shall be liberal with you.\" \" These are aistressing, these distresses are ; if there are any old family relics, or that.\" \" I suppose there will be nobody about after dark.\" \"We shall be engaged upon our beer.\" No one could say that the office was betrayed, but \" a wink is as good as a nod to a blind horse.\" Did you ever try to discover the reason whv sorrow is always dry. If not, it does not matter, take the proverb to be true. It was certainly true on this occasion ; for the men in possession were boosing and smoking as if they had begun a long job, wbich they meant to get through as well as they could. But, surely, you do not mean to say there was any sorrow with them.' Weil, thsre was no particular sorrow with them, though they sat as silent as sorrow ; but the servants were very sorrowful. They had fdfcnd some wine, and were drowning care with that. He with the coppery nose found his way to the servants, and had not the least objection to take wine with them. Before he did so he wiped his nose, then screwed up the handkerchief in one hand, placed his pipe upon the table, lifted up the glass, and said, \" My service to you. ' \" Hang that,\" said Johnny Trot, \" I do not want your service. Come, drink that ever again.\" \"He did not see,\" as he said, \"any objection to that 'ere.\" So th^y filled his glass again, and he drank \" My respects to you, ladies and gentlemen all, and your very good health.\" \" Bill !\" shouted he to the ex-prize fighter. Bill answered his call, with his pipe in his left hand, then took a chair, and sat among them. He looked at the wine with a side glance for about the space of a minute. He shuffled his feet upon the floor, looked down at them, and then lifted his eyes and looked straight at the wine. \"Is that port or sherry?\" said he. \"Sherry,\" said Johnny Trot, \" but if you would like a glass of port, I will get"], [326, "318 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. you one.\" \"Hand over that,\" said he. He tossed it off with- out any introductory wish whatever, and pushed the empty glass towards the bottle to be refilled. \" Have you got much of that,\" said he. \"The matter of seven dozen.\" \" Where?\" said he. \" Down in the cellar.\" Upon this answer he winked at him with the coppery nose, who shut his eyes and blew several good clouds of smoke. \" I can keep dark,\" said he, \" and if anybody has a rouser I shan't split. I don't see why a gemman shouldn't be a gemman when there's wine in the crib.\" The ex-prize fighter was a low fellow, and saw no difference between one man and another, except as to the house he lodged in, the clothes he wore, the carriage he rode in, and the wine he drank. These were things to be envied. \" But gemmen were gemmen for all that. But the greatest gemman was he who had got most science, like Arthur Matthison or Humphry Jeffries. They could drink, wait on ladies, and put up their mawleys in the prize ring like heroes, they could. I always venture the needful on little Arthur : of the two, the basket maker is the most plucky. Lord bless yer, I've seen them stand up three hours and a half, and not have a dozen knock down blows between um, they'd got so much science.\" He looked at the footman with one of his sinister looks. \"Touchin' this 'ere wine ; is it locked up ?\" \" It is,\" said Johnny Trot; \"this is the key.\" He of the coppery noffe said, \" We have a right to go everywhere about the premises now we are in.\" \" Sink that,\" said the pugilist ; \"you couldn't contrive to leave that key in the door, could yer, or put it down some- where and forget where. Jemmy the cracksman always found keys that was forgot or left in the door by accident. Why then you see, if anybody had a bottle or two a piece for their own cheeks it was Jemmy, the cracksman, as had it all ; but I say's nuffin, I don't.\" A new light broke in upon Johnny Trot, and for a few minutes there was perfect silence ; each one was studying the position, or as it is the fashion to say, the situation. The ex prize fighter was the first to break silence, which he did by opening a discourse upon the noble art of self-defence, a subject which \"young men of spirit,\" as he said, \" all like to hear on.\" \" When you are a trainin',\" said he to Johnny Trot, \" you walk ten miles every day, and run two night and morning up hill ; that'il improve your wind. Eat raw beef for yer breakfast, and"], [327, "THE \"BAILEYS.\" 319 raw beef for your dinner ; that'll gie yer pluck.

When yer in the ring put yer right arm across yer bread basket, in this ways, and up with yer mallet, put yer left leg forward, and watch his eye. Don't look at his mawleys, watch his eye. As soon as there is a chance, pop on his peeper with yer mallet, and fetch him a ringer on the ribs with the right, and keep popping on his peeper whenever you have a chance, and if yer all right, wind and limb, it'll be a good mill. Now mind, yer allays mallet first, if you pop on his peeper fairly he'll go down, and as he is going down fetch him a ringer on his ribs, and down he goes.\" \" What,\" said the coachman, \" made you become a bum bailey ?\" \" I went into the public,\" said he, \" and couldn't do it. Yer see this was it : I had a mill with the ' Throstle ' for fifty pounds a side. When me and my backers went out they was nobby ; my backers was all Corinthians ; we had as many follerd us as the ' Throstle' had follerin him. We fought for hatf an hour, when I threw up the sponge. All my friends follerdT the ' Throstle,' and I went home by myself. All on um was on the wiunin' side, all on um was. I was the loser, so had to go home by myself ; but though I was the loser, I wornt the loser for all that. Y*er see it stood in this way : when I bets I allays bets to win, as all on us does ; we all on us allays bets to win ; we are in the know, yer know, and we allays does that. I made all my bets for myself, for myself to win yer see, as how I couldn't do nuffin else. I couldn't bet again myself, my backers wouldn't stand that, so I got a friend to bet agen me, for me ; for I wanted to win, yer see, whether I won or lost. Well I'd bet so as if I won as I should lose two hundred pounds. So he bet so as if I should win I should lose three hundred pounds. O, says I, that'll never do, says I ; if I'm to win I must lose ; so I did lose and I won three hundred pounds. Now with that I set up in the public line, but yer see my friends was all took in, but I couldn't help it.

I lost it all, so now I've got this here job. Hand over the rosy.\" When the ex-prize fighter had finished, another visit was made to the wine cellar. It was a very singular thing, but the key of the wine cellar was mislaid, and when an inventory had to be taken of its contents, there was nothing but empty bottles. The bailey never made any enquiry, but said to his men, \" You have been in luck, you have ; how did you like it ? \""], [329, "CANVASSING. 321 CHAPTER XLVI. CANVASSING. Mr. Twittles arrived at the office all of a heat, as if he had been making great haste. He sprung round the desk with a twist, hung his hat upon his own peg, and said, \" Has the governor any one with him?\" \" No, he has not,\" said his fellow clerk. Mr. Twittles wiped his forehead, pushed his fingers through his wet hair, and went at once into Mr. Goader's office, and said, \" Mr. Biteum has been to Mr. Mincher's warehouse, and given the clerk a guinea to make out a list of the creditors for his use.\" \" We must have a list instantly,\" said Mr. Goader. \" I gave the clerk half a guinea for the list he had made out for Mr. Biteum,\" said Mr. Twittles, \"and told him to make Mr. Biteum another.\" \" Quite right, quite right ; you did quite right, Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr Goader, as he rose from his seat, and went to his chest to repay Mr. Twittles the half-guinea he had ad vanced. \" Now, Mr. Twittles,\" continued he, \" I shall want you to make some extra exertions in this matter. You get the majo rity of proofs, and I shall give you a guinea for those extra exertions. Take a coach, and charge it to the office. Spare no expense. Biteum must not carry the choice. Now mind Biteum must not carry the choice.\" Mr. Twittles had been to Mr. Mincher's warehouse on business, and he saw the clerk making out a list of the creditors, and from his experience in such matters he knew what was its meaning. He wanted to know what he was doing. The clerk told him that Mr. Biteum had been there on behalf of one of the creditors, and had said to him how sorry he was that Mr. Mincher had failed, and how much he regretted that the clerk should be thrown out of his situation at such a season as this, when trade was so bad, that it l"], [330, "322 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. might be some time before he would get another ; and that if he could get a list of the creditors he might be able to make some arrangement by which the concern might go on, and so save the necessity of throwing him out of employment. He expressed great commiseration for him ; and to show him that his sympathy was real he gave him a guinea, upon the understanding that he made him the list out that night. The clerk had no guile, and did not suspect guile in other people. He thought what a nice kind man Mr. Biteum was ; he had so much feeling about him, and so much consideration ; it was a pleasure to have a friend like him spring up, when the gloomy days of trouble had come. He thought Providence was always kind to her children i she took care of the sparrow through the cheerless winter, and would not neglect Mr. Mincher's clerk, but would carry him through the evil days upon which he had fallen. He further thought that Mr. Biteum was an instrument in the hands of Providence to assist him in coming difficulties ; and it might be so, as Old Joe would have said, for Providence is like a lawyer, and makes use of all kinds of instruments to aocompli-h its ends : the lion which roars and devours, the serpent which poisons and gorges, the pestilence which strikes and destroys, the storm wliich tosses man's bark and dashes it on the rocks a hopeless wreck, as well as the flower which is the precursor of the seed, the wine which makes glad the heart of man, and the ever blessed sunshine, which covers the earth with beauty and fills man's garners with plenty. Old Joe would have further said that you do not always see the instruments which the lawyer uses nor the intention of those which you can see ; and shall we say that Providence is not better than a lawyer, because we cannot always see the instruments she uses, nor understand the intentions of those we can see? Trust in Providence, for the experience of thousands and thousands of years have proved that Providence is kind ; but if you once give way to the roguish tricks of the lawyer, you do not trust in Pro vidence, and you must not be surprised if, like Cain, you are cast out a vagabond and a wanderer on the face of the earth. I have said that Mr. Mincher's clerk was without guile : he had not the least idea what Mr. Biteum really intended. The thought that language could be used to deceive, and such kind language too, did not enter into his head. He did not believe it, when"], [331, "323 CANTASSING. Mr. Twittles told him that all that was wanted with the list of the creditors was to get as many proofs as would carry the appointment of assignee. When he asked why he should want to do that, Mr. Twittles made no reply, but smiled at his simplicity. Mr. Twittles was intent upon playing his cards in such a way as to take the trick out of Mr. Biteum's game. Now this was Mr. Biteum's object, as it is the object of all attorneys in the like cases. He wished to carry the appointment of assignee; then that assignee would make him attorney to the estate, and that would enable him to make a bill of between four and five hundred pounds. Mr. Goader did not intend to lose the opportunity of making the bill himself, and therefore did he instruct Mr. Twittles to spare no expense. Mr. Mincher's clerk was a simple man ; but I have seen tradesmen, experienced tradesmen, act with as much simpli city. They would have an assignee that would not be bamboozled ; one who would look into the case ; one who would ferret out the roguery ; one who would let them see that they should not cheat the trading community. Fudge, if a man has lost all what is there to look into but losses. The assignee would get nothing by the job ; but the lawyer he might appoint would make a large addition to his income, and this was what Mr. Biteum and Mr. Goader fought for.

Twittles went into the stable and found Tom harnessing his horses. \" Now, Tom,\" 6aid Mr. Twittles, \" put a pair of your best horses in your machine.

The voters would not like it. We must show a different colour to every voter. We shall have to tell them all we have come to serve them, and make them believe it.\" \" And at the same time you are serving yourself, eh ?\" said Tom. \"Who's on the other side?\" \"Biteum,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Biteum,\" said Tom ; \" he had me up before the"], [332, "324 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. beaks because 1 would not take him to the Lozells for a mile and a half, and then said he did it for the public good. The public good, says I, he looks as if he did anything for the public, don't he ? He never does nothing for the public but what they pay him for ; and he never does nothing for the public good only when it will save him a bob or two. The public good, eh ; he wants to bilk me out of my fare, that's what he wants ; but I ain't going to be done by him, no I ain't. But I never see such fellows as those are. Let a lawyer or a policeman say what they will they believe them.

' If they say it ain't more than a mile and a half to the Lozells,' says I, ' they have been well trained ; and your worship might know of your own sense, if you have got any, that it is more than that.' ' There is no evidence before the court,' says he, ' as to distance ; and in the absence of such evidence I must dismiss the case. ' Put it off,' says I, ' aud I'll have it measured.' I had it measured, and I beat him. His worship would not believe that it was a mile and a half to Wralsall unless he had got a surveyor to swear that he had measured it \u2014 such a set of fools as they are.

Mr. Twittles 1st himself out at the brassfounder's, and darted up the entry. Now the brassfounder was a young man ; his father was dead, and he managed the business for the family. He had a defect in speech, and stammered badly. His intentions were pure and honourable, but his perceptions were as slow as his speech, and it required time to make him understand the business. \" WTh-wh-wh-what i-i-is it a-a-a-about ?\" \" Mr. Mincher has become bankrupt.\" \" We-we-well ? \" \" Mr. Goader directed me to ask you to give him your proof of your debt.\" \" W h-wh-wh-what for ?\" \" To procure the appointment of assignee.

Give my compliments to Mr. Goader, and say I shall always be happy to give him my patronage when it is in my power.\" \" I am sure he will be much obliged to you.\" As Mr. Twittles went down the gateway he said to himself, \" We shall have him at the office on a borrowing expedition.\" \" Did you get it ?\" said Tom ; \" did you do it downy ?\" \" All right, Tom,\" said he; \"soft soap won.\" \"Nothing like doing it downy,\" said Tom. \" Now to Deritend, to the wire-drawer's.\" \" Where's the opposition?\" says Tom. \"I sees none. I want a jolly good hurrah \u2014 a dead cat or two, and some rotten eggs. I want to take a wheel off, and upset somebody. Blow a 'lection where there's no fighting.\" \"Wre are first, Tom ; we are all be fore them,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Hadn't we better turn round and meet um ? I want some fun in it.\" \" We are winning, Tom; never mind the fun.\" \" Blow that,\" says Tom. \"When a 'lection's all over it's done, and o' no use but to him has is won.

I can see nobody as knows nothing about it.\" \" Never mind, Tom ; we are winning.\" \"O blow wiunin' ; its too quiet for me.\" On they went, down Deritend, to the wire drawer's. \" This is a crusty old cove,\" said Twittles. \" I must try to persuade him we are going to hang the bankrupt. He can see no justice but in hanging all the bankrupts, and shooting all the lawyers and judges and juries.\" \"Ah, he ain't been in trouble himself, or he'd know better,\" said Tom. \" I have some of those 'ere coves as never knowed what trouble is. They have got no hearts, they ain't; they are all whip and no corn, they are. Let them know what I know, then they'll know that a hoss as has no corn can't. Yer may whip yer arm off; if there is no corn there is no spirit ; and if there's no spirit there's no go. He's got too much corn, he has ; he's fat, and that makes him a kicker. Humour him, Mr. Twittles, humour him. The whip's o' no use to him. Give him his head, and let him run till he's tired ; he'll soon gallop himself quiet, he will, or run himself into mis- chief.\" Mr. Twittles went into the counting house. \" I am sorry,\" said Mr. Twittles, to have to come to you upon the business I have. People are all such rogues now, there is no knowing who to trust, nor whom to believe. Such cheating as is going on in these days, a man, as my governor says, may work day and night, and kill himself with the anxieties of business. Now and then some scoundrel, who ought to be transported, fails, and robs you of all you trusted him with. The law is not half severe enough for such fellows. I would send them to Botany Bay, and let the cannibals eat them up. Here is this psalm singing hypocrite of a Mincher, with the parsons dining with him every Sunday, making religion a cloak for his villany.\" \" If I had my way I would shoot him and all such hypocritical scoundrels. Times will be no better until every one of them are shot or hanged \u2014 the sneaking, snivelling hypocrites,\" said the wire drawer. \" He came feeling my governor,\" said Mr. Twittles, \"and got him to lend him several hundreds, and now he has failed ; but my governor says he shall not get through it, he will have every penny he has got. He knows there is a"], [336, "328 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. flaw or two in his settlements, and he is not going to let him ride off with those settlements, and leave nothing for his creditors. My governor knows a thing or two in the law, and he means to let him have all he knows.\" \"I cannot trust any of you Bir mingham lawyers ; you are all of you combined together,\" said the wire-drawer, at the same time spreading out his arms as if he would be glad to be shut of every one of them. \" Rogue assisting rogue. I will have a London lawyer. I am not going to be done. I will lose every penny, and as much again to it, before I will be done. I shall have the sharpest lawyer there is in London. I am not going to be done.\" \" There wants some body to look into it,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" If things go on in this way, we shall be all ruined. Mr. Goader is just of your mind, and he means to punish him. He has sent me down to you. He was sure you would be animated by the same sentiments which animate him. He wants your proof to help him to punish him. the scoundrel.\" \" No, I shall have a lawyer from London,\" said the wire drawer; I shall act for myself. \" \" Mr. Goader does not wish to act for you; he will assist you, and you will assist him,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" He and your lawyer will work together. Your proof will help him to do that. He will punish the scoundrel, I know. Give him your proof, and he will take care that he has all the law will give him.\" The proof was obtained. Mr. Twittles thought this his master-piece, and went out laughing to Tom. \" All right,\" said he ; \"I've got it off the old brute.\" Tom was going to groan and howl at him ; but Mr. Twittles said, \" Hush, we shall beat him by uot opposing him. The expense will cure him. Neither groaning nor howling will do him any good. Let us lawyers administer a little opening medicine ; that will clear his head. If not, we will give him a drastic purge ; we will clear him out, and that will do it.\" \" Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed Tom. Give him the gripes \u2014 the money gripes, eh, Mr. Twittles, then he will want no more o' that 'ere physic. \" Ha, ha, ha ! That is it. You know how to do it downy.

Don't let old Biteum ha' the good uns.\" Mr. Twittles rang at the bell. The door was opened by a pull in tbe warehouse, which communicated with the latch as a pull does with a bell. The contrivance is now common \u2014 it was then a new thing. Mr. Twittles pushed the door open, and looked behind it for the person who had lifted the latch, and was startled at finding no one there. He stood in bewilderment, looking round for the lad who had opened the door, for he supposed some boy in his fun had done it, aud then hid himself. \" W'alk up,\" shouted a voice at tbe top of the stairs; so Mr. Twittles walked up. \" Well,\" said the umbrella maker, \"what is your will?' \"I have called, by direction of Mr. Goader, to ask the favour of your proof against the estate of Mr. Mincher, a bankrupt.\" \" I am sorry to hear he is a bankrupt. Could no other way be found to settle his difficulties except the lough and often inhuman way of bankruptcy ?\" \" It was thought not,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Thought not, was it. Was any trial made ? You lawyers seem to have but one clumsy way of curing a sickly estate, and that is death Cut him up. The skill you boast about is the skill of the butcher, and not of the physician. Kill him and cut him up ; you seem to know no other way.\" \" It is our clients,\" said Mr. Twittles ; \" it is our clients. We are but the instruments iu the hands of our clients. If there were more humanity among our clients, there would be more humanity among the lawyers. We do but our clients' biddings If we did not do the work we were directed to do, our clients would employ other workmen.\" \"Ay, ay, the old story; an inhuman man is always ready with an apology for bis inhumanity. Jack Ketch will tell you the same thing ; but, Sir, I would rather starve than be such an instrument. Who is on the other side?\" \"Biteum,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Biteum,\" said the umbrella maker, \" he is a very inhuman man. There's no discretion whatever with him ; he comes down upon a man as suddenly as a flash of lightning, and with about as much discrimination.

I must tell you frankly I like neither of you, and I think society would sustain no real loss if all you lawyers were swept away ; but of the two evils, Biteum or Goader, I think Goader the least, so I suppose you must have the proof.\""], [339, "331 CANVASSING. CHAPTEE XL VI I. CANVASSING When Mr. Biteum heard that Mr. Mincher was bankrupt, which he did as soon as the bailiffs were in possession, he im mediately went to Mr. Mincher's office, and arranged, as we have seen, with the clerk for a list of the creditors, which the clerk took to him by mid-day, being sooner than the time promised. As soon as he had received it, his mind decided who he would attempt to make assignee. He went to Mr. Sticker, although Mr. Sticker was not one of the creditors, but found that Mr. Goader had spoken to him. He therefore fell back upon Mr. Sticker's opponent, and sought his consent to act if appointed. Now Mr. Sticker's opponent was a young man, very shrewd, of a rapid and decided perception, generally correct in judgment, firm almost to obstinacy in his opinions, and strong in his pas sions. When a man obtained favour with him he was to him a fast friend; when a man fell under his displeasure he pursued him with the spirit of a blood avenger, and tracked him to his ruin. His mind was of the first order, but he had an infirmity of temper which went far to counterbalance all the good qualities of the man. In his level moments he was a gentleman ; when roused to passion, which was easily done, his language was culled from the vocabulary of a blackguard, and, setting aside its character, it expressed his ideas with fulness and precision. His wealth and ability fitted him for any and every station of honour his native town had to give ; and he, in some part of his life, filled most if not all of them, and that with credit to himself and advantage to the town. Whenever \" that temper which his mother gave him\" was not roused, he was a very useful man ; but when it was, it was painful to see how much this infirmity detracted from his use-"], [340, "332 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. fulness. Perhaps there was no man 90 shrewd and clear-headed, and no man who won so bad a reputation. From his ability and his station he might have been respected and honoured, but his excitable temper made him feared and hated. Yet under the whole of his character there was a strong substratum of kindli ness, which now and then would crop to the surface. It was like a sunny land in stormy regions. When the sky was clear it was indeed beautiful ; when the storm raged the flowers were broken, their colours were dashed, aud the beauty of the land was covered with deformity. \" Mr. Carleswood,\" said Mr. Biteum, smirking and smiling in his blandest manner, hoping that the sunshine of his counten ance \u2014 although it was as the sunshine on a rocky land, which serves but to make its sterility more plain \u2014 would communicate its brightness to his mind \u2014 \" Mr. Carleswood, how do you do? I am glad to see you look so cheery this morning.\" But tbat was a 1 \u2014 stop, stop; not so plain \u2014 say a fib. The other word means the same, and is more emphatic ; but then it is vulgar \u2014 the truth in barragan ; and, if it be possible, tell the truth in silk ; it is more respectable. Cover your meaning with fig leaves or drapery, for there are eyes so refined they cannot look at nature as God made it, it is so vulgar. It was not true ; Mr. Carlswood's countenance did not look cheery, but it suited Mr. Biteum's purpose to say it did, for he well knew that very ex citable minus are sometimes like a mirror which reflects every passion which you bring to it \u2014 frowns, if frowns are brought ; smiles, if smiles are brought ; leaden clouds and dulness, if leaden clouds and dulness are in the sky ; or sunshine and bright ness, when its cheering influence is present. But \" Mr. Carles wood,\" said Mr. Biteum, \" I am glad to see you look so cheery this morning.\" \"Are you?\" said Mr. Carleswood. Now Mr. Carleswood was, when a young man, called old Carleswood, but more frequently old Carley ; not because of his age, but because he had all the sagacity which age usually gives to others. \" By the way,\" said Mr. Biteum, \" how are you getting on in re Bissell? \" \" Oh, no how; that Parker has thrown the Summer Hill property into Chancery. I offered him all the costs incurred and half the proceeds of the sale, but he said there was no title, and none could be made but from Chancery. Heaven and the"], [341, "CANVASSING. 333 Lord Chancellor only know when that will be ; not, certainly, until the property is gone. I want to wind up the estate as it is, and abandon that property ; but Sparrow says it will uot be safe, and that no dividend should be made ; it is unsafe. I suppose you must have all among you. It will be as usual ; you lawyers must have all the estate, and I, the poor unfortunate assignee, must have all the blame.\" \" Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed Mr. Biteum; \"Parker's a clever fellow.\" Now cleverness, in the opinion of Mr. Biteum, consisted in keeping the estate as long as possible in hand, by surrounding it with so many doubts that even a Lord Chancellor could not see bis way out of it It was a maxim with him that there was nothing certain in law, and that no property should be parted with until all the uncer tainties were removed \u2014 that was seldom the case until the skins and the parchments which formed the title to the property took up their permanent abode in his own safe. \"In re Mincher,\" said Mr. Biteum ; \" I see you are a creditor ; will you act if I succeed in carrying the appointment? \" \" To serve you I will do it ; but I thiuk of giving up these assigneeships. There is no satisfaction in them ; and the few scraps I get are not a sufficient remuneration.\" \" This will not be an ordinary estate. There is property ; and there will be enough to contend for. We shall all gain.\" \" Well,\" said old Carley, I hope you will succeed.\" Mr. Biteum started on the canvas himself. Pray, Sir, did you know Mr. Biteum ? He was a dapper little man ; dressed all in black, with a white neckcloth rolled round his neck and tied behind ; he wore steel buckles at his knees, and steel buckles in his shoes ; his stockings were black silk, with orna mental clocks in them ; he had a gold watch and chain, with a large bunch of seals dangling from his fob ; his beard and whiskers were closely shaven ; his complexion was florid, and his eyes were small but piercing. You must have known him. His walk was like a trot ; he was very fond of trotting along at the edge of the footpath. He was a great man in his day, and could not believe he would be so soon forgotten. Now just think for a moment ! you must have known him ! He had a small patch, about as large as a shilling, of red cabbage ou his right cheek ; and when speaking to any one he drew a white lawn handkerchief"], [342, "334 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. from his pocket and man\u0153uvred with it, first to his eye, then his cheek, then bis ear and then his chin, as if he were ashamed of his mother's mark, and was trying to hide it. Did not you know him ? Dear me ! he was a frequent visitor to Rag Hall ; his voice was of a counter-tenor pitch. Not know him! How treacherous your memory is There was another peculiarity in the man. When his hat was off there was a round bald place upon his head, about as large as a cheese plate, and in the centre there was a wart. You do not remember him ! Well, I should have thought that he would have lived in the memory of all of that generation, and of the rising generation ; and that tradition would have handed down his name to future generations in consequence of the evil he did. But you say you did not know him, and that it must be a fancy portrait. No it is not. But let him be forgotten; he amassed a large fortune ; he did no good thing while he lived in the world ; when he died he left his property to strangers far away, and gave not a shilling to the charities of the town in which he had amassed his wealth. Let him be forgotten ; and all such. A few days ago I went to look at his tomb. I found it broken and neglected. The virtues which the recipients of his wealth had engrossed upon the stone \u2014 heaven knows they were not to be found in the man \u2014 were all obliterated ; and though they were familiar to me from their falsehoods, I could not decipher them. And so you do not remember him ? Well, let him be forgotten. Had he have left some of his wealth to the charities of his native town he might have blest many generations, and his memory might have been cherished. But he is gone, and let him be forgotten. If I continue to use him as a personage in my story, it is because it would not be complete without him. The story of the rebellion in heaven cannot be told without recounting the deeds of Lucifer ; but it would have been better for Earth had Lucifer never been. Let the names of those who have done good in the world be embalmed in the memories of men, for they are as the sainted ones ; but let the wicked be forgotten ; or if they must have a niche, let it be in Pandemonium. I have said that Mr. Biteum set about the canvas himself. He intended to trot to as many of them a3 he could, and hire a coach to rest himself, and finish the remainder. The first place he called at was the brassfounder's. \"He, he, he; how do you"], [343, "CANVASSING. 335 do?\" said he, with a giggling laugh ; \"lam glad to have the pleasure of shaking hands with you. He, he, he ; how is your mother ? Hope she is well ; very lonely to be left a widow, very ; it is hard for a man to meet the troubles of life and the perplexities of business, but for a widow it is very cheerless ; but she has a good son to bear some of the burdens. I do not wonder at a widow desiring to get married again, the trials of life are so perplexing. She knows what are the comforts and enjoy ments of a married life, a maiden does not ; there is there fore nothing surprising in a widow trying with more persistency to be re-married than a maiden tries to be married.\" \" I-I-I ho-ho-hope mi-mi-my mo-mo-mo-mother won't marry a-a-again.\" \" Well, there is no knowing what may happen ; she is a good woman, and if I were a widow, ha, ha, ha, I mean a widower, I should re-marry as soon as I could meet with a suitable lady.\" \" Bu-bu-but Mr. Bi-Bi-Biteum, yo-yo-you are a-a-a ba-ba-bach elor.\" \"I know, to my misfortune, I have always been so busy, I have not had time to go courting ; and where ladies are con cerned, I am so shy I require to be courted. I can look at them well enough, but I cannot speak to them on the tender passion ; for a lawyer, it looks so simple, and a lawyer should do nothing but what is crafty, deep, and wise ; he loses cast when he becomes foolish.\" \" D-d-d-do you th-th-th-think it fo-fo-fo-foolish to m-m-marry ?\" \" 0 dear no, on the contrary, I think it honour able ; but to business. I see you are so unfortunate as to be creditors of Mincher.\" \" Y-y-yes, and w-w-we ha-ha-ha-have gi-gi-given our p-p-p-proof to Go-Go-Go-Goader.\" \" Indeed, I am sorry to have troubled you.\" From there he went to the japanner's, but found Mr. Goader had that proof also, so he went down to the stand and engaged \" Old Charley.\" He surmised the direction Mr. Twittles had taken ; he did not waste time in following him, but struck out in what he thought a new direction. He drove at once down High Street, into Moor Street ; in turning the corner they saw Old Tom and Mr. Twittles coming up Dig beth. Tom turned round, and said to Mr. Twittles, \" Do you see them, Sir ? Old Charley has got Biteum ; now is your time. Y'ou tackle Biteum, and I'll pitch into Charley.\" \" No, no, Tom, we lawyers never fight.\" \" But you blow one another up, don't yer ? You call one another learned friends, don't yer ? I know"], [344, "336 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. what learned friends means, it's law for blackguards, ain't it ? I know a thing or two ; 1 ain't seen so much when I've been waiting for my fare, but I know what that means. You blow up Biteum, and I'll go it at Charley ; let us have some fun ; blow a 'lection where there is no fun.\" \" Tom,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" we never blow one another up but when we are paid for it, and then it is to amuse the payors for the profit of the payees.\" \" And who be they, Mr. Twittles ?\" said Tom, quite bewildered, by the ors and tbe ees. \" Wby Tom, this is it : whoever does a thing we put an or to the end of tbe name, and whoever receives it we put an ee, and we know who acts and who receives the action by the ors and the ees.\" \" How is that?\" says Tom. \" Here's my hoss ; I act on him, don't I ? Very well then, if I am the hossor and he the hossee, I must be a hoss as well as he. Come, come, you lawyers can make black white, but that won't do, you can't make me into a hoss, I ain't got no tail; if I had somebody would be crupperin' me up more than I am. None o' that gammon, Mr. Twittles, it won't do.\" \"No, no, Tom, that is not it ; if you whip your horse, you are the whippor and he is tbe whippee ; you act and he receives tbe action, that is it, Tom.\" \"That is it, is it?\" said Tom, still bewildered by the explanation, but trying to understand it by another application of the principle. \" Ihen, Mr. Twittles, look here, is it in this way ? if I pitch into Old Charley, I'm the pitchor ajid he's the pitchee. Now, that won't do ; 1 ain't a pitcher; I wish I was, then I should be oftener full o' rum than I am. It might be true of Old Charley, he's pitchy enough. I could never make nuffin o' law, I couldn't, it's such stuff; if it was sense I could understand it, but as it ain't, I can't. Now, look here, Mr. Twittles, 1 don't like to see Biteum and (harley cut along in that way ; I want to pitch into um. If we cross um again I'll take a wheel off, else my name ain't Old Tom.\" \" Now Tom,\" said Mr. Twittles, \" you must not get into trouble ; my governor will not get you out without more money than you will like to pay. We lawyers only blow one another up when tbe public, who are our clients and pay us, are by to listen. We never blow one another up when there are no listeners ; the court let's us do it because they know what it means ; it's gag to feed our clients on, that is all, to let them say, how we did give it them. We"], [345, "CANVASSING. 337 told them what they were, aud no mistake. The Court does not listen to us, it takes that time to look over the notes, aud arrange the judgment ; it knows what it all means, and takes no notice; it's gag. and nothing more, Tom. Our clients think it is all right ; but they do not know gag from evidence. Now, Tom, I have let you iuto the secret.\" \"Ah, Mr. Twittles, you're downy coves, and know how to do it downy. Nothing like doing it downy. I suppose gag, as you call it, is what we call chaffin'. We chaff for fun, and you chaff for money. Ah, you're downy coves ; I w ishes as how I'd been a lawyer, then I should a been a downy cove.\" Mr. Biteum and Mr. Twittles went on their own ways, getting as many proofs as they could. The office which both of them occupied, the one as a lawyer, the other as a lawyer's clerk, had giveu them the opportunity to know the character of most, if not all tbe tradesmen in the town ; those they did not know from experience they knew from reputation ; besides their profession gave them such an iusight into men's miuds, that almost as soon as they saw them they knew the men, and as men were but as counters with which to play out their games, (hey soon ascertained their value ; they neither contradicted nor opposed any man so long as he was of service to them, but fell into his temper and his spirit, adopted his opinions, and appeared to be with him hand and glove ; but when he was used up, or no longer of any use to them, he was thrown aside with the roughest feeling and almost kicked from their presence ; not from any savage or bar- barous feeling, but because they did not any longer want him ; therefore he must either go out of the way or be kicked out of the way. Now, in the canvas, they both used the knowledge they had obtained in the office, they expressed the sentiments and feelings of every man they came to, fell into his feelings at once, and used the language he would use, stating the case even stronger with their artificial feeling than the man with his natural feeling felt himself capable of doing, and although he still had doubts as to the propriety of doing as they desired, he did it, for they spoke fair, and understood the matter as he did. If he after wards discovered they had used him for their own ends he would exclaim, \" O what devils these lawyers are ! ' He would be quite right ; they are wicked and deceitful men, they are so sharp."], [346, "338 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. In the evening, Tom, Mr. Twittles, and the \"hosses,\" returned home fagged and jaded. The \" hosses \" were pulled up before the Plume of Feathers ; Tom jumped down, freed the bearing reins, and drew the driving reins through the terrets, and laid them across the \" hosses' \" backs ; the \" hosses,\" smoking with heat and perspiration, shook themselves, stretched out their necks, lifted their lips, then shook themselves again, until they made the har ness rattle, then looked round for the bucket for a drink of water, for they were thirsty, and so was Tom, and Mr. Twittles. The stable boy gave the \" hosses \" some water, Peggy brought Tom a glass of water with some rum in it, and Mr. Twittles did as Tom did ; all four of them thought that after hard work they should \" wet the whistle.\" Peggy stood waiting for the change. \" It goes down to the office, Peggy,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Have you won, Sir?\" said Peggy. \"I flatter myself,\" said Mr. Twittles, \"that Biteum will not beat us.\" \"No,\" said Tom, \"it'll take a better man than Biteum to beat us ; we did it downy, we did. I took the shine out of Old Charley, I did. I wanted to take a wheel off, but Mr. Twittles wouldn't let me ; if I could a took a wheel off, I could a stopt um for the day, Peggy,\" said Tom, addressing bis pretty little Peggy, lifting his glass, and giving her one of those sly looks, which, with young people, means love. \"Peggy, my luck's towards you.\" \" It was not her bonny blue eye was my ruin ; Fair, though she be, that was not my undoing; But, 0 'twas the witching sweet stolen glance of kindness Which beamed from her eye when nobody did mind us.\" The very sedate people would say it was wicked the way in which Tom looked at Peggy, and Peggy looked at Tom. \" Ah,\" said Mr. Twittles, putting his hand upon his heart, and heaving a deep sigh, \" I wish somebody would look at me, as wicked as that.\" \" You are a naughty man,\" said Peggy, and ran away."], [347, "MEETING OF CREDITORS. 339 CHAPTEK XLVIII MEETING OF CREDITORS From the canvas it was sufficiently obvious to Mr. Biteum that he would lose the appointment of assignee ; but he was one of those men who did not know when he was beaten, whom apparent defeat merely nerves to further effort. During the canvas he had discovered a hot and fiery spirit ; one who would take any and every course to crush the bankrupt ; one whose passion did not permit him to see the truth, nor to discern whether his course of conduct would accomplish the end he had in view. He wanted to do something at once, and not wait for the formal pedantry of the bankruptcy commissioners ; his language was \" Cannot we arrest him ? Cannot we put him iu prison ? Cannot we treat him as we would any other man who robs his fellow man? Why should there be any distinction among thieves? Is not robbery the same whether it be done according to law, or in opposition to law?\" One who set up his own standard of morality as the standard by which the world should be judged. One whose no tion of law was the law which ought to prevail, and all other no tions but the interested jargon of interested parties, of men who wanted to keep the matter in hand as long as they could, so that they might fatten upon poverty and misfortune ; the leeches of society, who irritate the inflammation, which as leeches they subdue ; men who revel in the riches they have drawn from the tattered poverty which stands at the gate and moans; men who are not ashamed of taking the last penny from the miserable outcast, instead of dropping one into his hand in charity. Could not something be done ? \" For my part,\" said he, \" I should be ashamed to roll up to the Court in my carriage, with its splended trappings, and its emblazoned shields, and know that"], [348, "340 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. at the opposite door was the crouching and abject misery from whose poverty I obtained the means to roll up in splendour. But some men care not whom their chariot wheels crush to death if they can but have chariots to ride in.\" Now he was a button maker, and just the man Mr. Biteum wanted; he had a fluent tongue and a hot head ; Mr. Biteum thought he could be judiciously guided in the right path ; he saw not the consequences of his own conduct, the all important present engrossed his thoughts, or perhaps it should be his passions, for his words were more the expressions of passions than of thoughts ; his haste did not permit him to think ; he was a flashy fire which soon burnt out and left but few ashes. To him it was Mr. Biteum went as soon as he found he was defeated, to propose the scheme by which he hoped yet to win. \"Mr. Corkins,\" said he, \"I have been turning Mr. Mincher's matter over in my mind, and I have de vised a plan by which, with your assistance, we may get such an investigation of his doings as may lead to very important results. I propose to call a meeting of his creditors immediately, to see what we can do ; the Court, you see, is so difficult to move, it will not do anything unless we give evidence upon every iota ; that gives the guilty too great a chance ; the guilt may be as notorious as the price of apples in the market-place, but such is the absurd pedantry that the Court will not admit it. Writh it, he who wins the case has not always the best cause, but he who has the skill, the diligence, and the opportunity to collect the best evidence, and the experience to know what we lawyers in courtesy call the mind of the Court considers evidence ; the Court professes to have no mind nor knowledge of its own, and heaven reward them, for on this matter they often tell the truth ; it is frequently mere routine and habit, seldom discrimination. To argue with them is often as useless as whistling jigs to pig3. Now, I propose this : I proposetocalla meeting of creditors immediately to havethebank rupt before us, and examine him ourselves, to give every creditor an opportunity of questioning him; you, Mr. Corkins, may examine him as well as a lawyer, and can put questions to him the Court would not allow. What the creditors want is the truth ; that we cannot expect if the Court is to be continually disallowing the questions put, as if it were their office to assist the bankrupt to conceal the truth. Now I will call a meeting at the Union, with"], [349, "MEETING OF CREDITORS. 341 your permission ; I will use your name in doing it, but I shall not call upon you for any of the expenses.\" It was agreed between them that a meeting should be called. The room at the Union was formerly more used for creditors' meetings than it is now ; yet in many respects it is one of the best rooms in Birmingham for the purpose ; it is central, known to most tradesmen, and the proprietor is very accommodating. It has two defects, it is low and rather too dark. The meeting was called, the room was well filled, the creditors were bad tempered, and unrelenting. There were nine lawyers, who had the interest of nine creditors to attend to. \" I cannot see,\" said the umbrella maker, \" what we are called here for. Without saying a word in disparagement of the legal gentlemen present, it is my opinion it will be impossible to come to any satisfactory decision. One lawyer will be able to excite enough doubts to prevent sufficient unanimity in a meeting like this ; but as there are nine present, with their several crotchets, and their several clients, it, is altogether vain to expect any decision whatever.\" Mr. Corkins, upon this, rose, and said, \" Gentlemen, I propose that we conduct our business properly, and shall therefore move Mr. Carleswood take the chair.\" It was carried that Mr. Carleswood take the chair. So the umbrella maker was extinguished. Mr. Biteum sat by the chairman's side as his legal adviser, Mr. Goader sat near Mr. Sticker ; there was also Fireby, Sparrow, Copperdale, Parker, Wormwood, Kenson, and young Oatland. Let me say in passing, that young Oatland began his career in a very trying and a very tempting profession, with honourable intentions, and so far as I know or could hear from others, those intentions we not departed from. He mixed up a spirit of native kindness with the business of the law. Whenever its most distressing visits had to be made under his direction they were kindly made; he advised inexpen sive arrangements ; he was more inclined to settle a quarrel than to get monev out of it ; he did much that was of sterling advantage to his native town, and to bless generations yet unborn, by whom, if there be any gratitude, his memory will be revered. It was all done without ostentation, or that pride which points to its deeds, and says, \" See what I have done.\" He was held in general estimation. As he advanced in life his golden locks became grey, honours fell upon him, and men mentioned his"], [350, "342 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. name with the silver tones of reverence. Mr. Carleswood opened the business of the meeting by saying, \" I am sorry to have to meet so many of you upon this business, but you are here, of course, to make the best you can of the estate. It is usual for people to consider themselves ill-used by these sort of things, but I need not tell gentlemen of your experience that the case is now before you, that any expression of temper will not further your objects, which must be to make the best you can of things as they are ; the case may deserve all the disapprobation you can possibly feel or express, but that will not increase your dividend, a matter I consider all important to a man of business.\" \" That is a pretty thing indeed,\" said the wire drawer; \"then a man is to rob and plunder us just as he likes, and his creditors are to be called together to let him go. I say, he ought to be punished, and I mean to do my best to punish him ; others may forgive him all he owes them, if they like, I shall take my own course ; I shall have a lawyer from London ; these Birmingham lawyers are all leagued together ; they will rob us, rob the church, and then rob one another if there is nobody else to rob.\" At this all the lawyers laughed, and all the creditors looked serious, as if he had expressed the opinion of the meeting, it might be in coarse terms, but still its opinion. Mr. Copperdale said, \" It is a pity my brethren have had to give you a lesson, for they seem to have offended you so much ; but if you would keep your own secret, we legal gentlemen should not betray it.\" He rose, snapped his fingers at Mr. Copperdale, and said, with violence, \" I do not care tbat for you nor any of your crew.\" \" Well, well, do not be so loud ; the lessons we give people are expensive, and apt to be effective. You remember, your words are actionable, and if you repeat them you may find yourself in trouble.\" All the lawyers looked at him as eagerly as so many dogs who are about to have a bone thrown among them. \" I do not care the snuff of a farthing candle for your actions; I shall tell the truth, if the truth be a libel.\" \" We have had quite enough of that,\" said the chair man. \" We are here to do business, and not to hear any man spit his venom. I have always found the lawyers gentlemen, It is true they make us all smart now and then, but while we are in irade, that we must expect ; there is no medicine the physician gives us which is agreeable ; we cannot expect the visitations of"], [351, "MEETING OF CREDITORS. 343 s lawyer to be more pleasant. I would advise that gentle- man\" \u2014 as he said so, he screwed up his eyes, and moved his body backwards and forwards, as if to take a more scrutin- ising inspection of the wire drawer \u2014 \"to take his castigations in good humour and in silence ; it might injure his credit to let everybody kuow how they have ill-used him.\" The wire drawer was aroused to greater passion, and his attempt to address the meeting created quite a tumult ; he gesticulated, stormed, threw his arms about. All that could be heard was, \" Rogues ! order, order ; thieves ! chair, chair ; a lawyer from London; turn him out; turn him out ! I will not be robbed.\" Tbe creditors jumped upon the chairs as if they thought they could see him better, instead of which he was smothered. \" I will lose all, and double as much, but I will be revenged.\" \" Silence ! silence ! turn him out !\" \" Oh, ay, turn me cut ; but I will leave you, and all such fools as you are.\" Upon this he put his hat upon his head, stuck it on the top, and slammed the door to after him. \" Let them wait until my lawyer comes from London ; he will put them right ; some of them will have to go to perdition.\" During the whole of this tumult the legal men were remarkably silent and cool ; no word nor action seemed to escape them ; but when it was over they grouped themselves together, and talked eagerly, and in whispers to each other. The only words wbich could be heard above a whisper were \"insolence;\" \"ought to be punished;\" \"an ignorant fellow ;\" \" proceedings agaiust him ;\" \" undoubtedly actionable.\" \" Now, gentlemen, quiet is again restored, let us proceed to business. If you have lost your money do not lose your temper as well,\" said the chairman. \" Mr. Biteum, have you anything to say to the meeting. I believe your client has been instrumental in calling it ; perhaps you will proceed.\" \" Mr. Mincher is a client of Mr. Goader's. It will be much better if Mr. Goader will explain why he has thought it best to make Mr. Mincher a bankrupt without consulting the creditors. If the bankrupt has lost all his property, what he may have in his possession is not his, but yours; and it would seem but courteous, as well as right, that you should be consulted before the extreme step of bankruptcy was taken. That is an expensive process \u2014 I may say an extravagantly ex pensive process ; and as it is expenses the creditors will have to"], [352, "344 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. pay, without saying anything against Mr. Goader's great know ledge of business and the law, I do think an explanation is due aud required why the step has been taken.\" The creditors cried, \" Hear, hear.\" The majority of creditors always want to know how the thing has been done, and are generally satisfied when they have learned it, and have had an opportunity of expressing their indignation. This is the reason why the first meeting of creditors is usually numerous. Mr. Biteum knew that the meet ing would support him ; and the more Mr. Goader attempted to shuffle off enquiry, or prevent publicity, the more the creditors would press for explanation. \" Mr. Biteum,\" said Mr. Goader, \" will, I hope give me credit for discretion, and a knowledge of the matter in hand. If 1 have taken the step I have, it was not without due and mature deliberation, with a full view of all the circumstances of the case, and with a thorough conviction that it was the proper step to take. I hope Mr. Biteum wili give me credit for honourable intentions.\" Mr. Corkins, warm and ex citable as usual, cried, \" Honour, indeed! a lawyer cannot do anything which is dark and doubtful without appealing to his honour. Honour, indeed ! all thieves pretend to be honest men ; all wantons, women of virtue ; and all lawyers, men of honour. All of them plight that of which they have the least, well suspect ing that the world knows it.\" \" Will you be in order,\" said the chairman, \" and not make these gratuitous and ill-natured re flections? they cannot do any good, and may do much harm. Your preaching will not alter the habits and opinions of men, nor turn back the current of events. Take things as they are, and not mind how they became as they are. I cannot permit any more of these reflections. Leave the matter in the hands of the legal gentlemen ; there are enough of them here to do it, and it is their business. Mr. Goader, was Mr. Mincher sued by any one?\" \"He was not.\" \"Or threatened to be sued?\" \" He had a notice of bankruptcy served upon him.\" \"Ay, ay, we know that; but it was a friendly affair.\" \"That I do not know,\" said Mr. Goader. \" I received instructions to proceed in bankruptcy, and I did so, of course.\" \" Now Mr. Goader, just answer me one question,\" said the chairman. \" Is not this a friendly affair ? \" \" I am not here under examination, nor to disclose the secrets of my profession, and I decline to answer.\" Upon this there were"], [353, "MEETING OF CREDITORS. 345 hisses and groans among the creditors; and a pleasant smile upon the countenance of Mr. Biteum. \" Allow me,\" said Mr. Goader, with an expression of injured innocence. \" I am here as a profes sional man ; I have the interests of my client to attend to ; and no expressions of disapprobation shall tempt me to forget those interests. Let me put it to every gentleman in this room, if he had confided his secrets to my keeping, what would he say of me, if, under any pressure, I betrayed him ? I should be unworthy of his confidence, and a disreputable member of the honourable profession to which I belong.\" As he said so he bowed to his brethren, and looked to them for applause. They said, \" Hear, hear ; hear, hear,\" and looked majesticallv wise. \" Mr. Chairman,\" said the umbrella maker, \" we are here as creditors of the estate : it is our interest to make the best we can of it. Mr. Mincher has for a long time held a position of respectability and honour in the town. He has acted during that time consistently with that character. No man falls all at once from a good man to a knave. It is against human nature and all experience to think so. I suppose Mr. Mincher is so overwhelmed with difficulties that he has no other way out of them but bankruptcy. I do not think that he has so far be come a knave that he has so arranged that he will make more money out of bankruptcy than by honest trade. I think him too shrewd for that, if I did not also think him too honest. What I propose is this, that a composition shall be made. Men usually offer such a composition as they can afford, and generally more than the estate will yield. I consider it in all cases the best eourse for the creditors to follow. Out of the estate all the ex penses must be paid. A composition has the least expense. In bankruptcy you have a whole host of people to pay. For instance, here are nine lawyers present. Their expenses must be paid by somebody. There are the commissioners, the various officers of their court, the accountants, the bailiffs, the auctioneers, and all the other people too numerous to mention, who settle upon a bankrupt estate. All of them so respectable and talented that they disdain to live excepting upon large incomes. Where does all this come from but out of the estate? So that a man who offers ten shillings in the pound, which he might readily pay ; whereas if the estate be thrown into bankruptcy it scarcely ever yields two"], [354, "346 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. shillings and sixpence in the pound. The people I have men- tioned have to be supported out of such estate, and it cannot be expected to pay as much after their claims are discharged as it would have done if they had no opportunity of making claims upon it. I do not wish to disparage the characters or reputations of any of them. They are human beings, as we are. It is the condition of things which makes them what they are. Trades- men have it in their power to alter the condition of things, and they should do it. To expect that these professional men, when they have an opportunity to make money out of bankrupts, will not do it, is to expect a purity and disinterestedness all very well to talk about, but very great folly to count upon. Of all the estates you have to administer, Mr. Chairman, when a composition has been offered and rejected, how many have realised a dividend equal to the composition offered ?\" \" None whatever.\" \"Mr. Sticker, you have been assignee to many hundreds of estates. How many do you say ?\" Mr. Sticker was suddenly afflicted with a violent fit of coughing, but during the fit his eye was wandering from one attorney to another, as if he expected to receive a lead from them, and had fallen into a fit of coughing to gain time. They com- menced a consultation among themselves, at the close of which Mr. Biteum and Mr. Goader retired for a private consultation. \"Biteum,\" said Mr. Goader, \"it is too bad of you to raise this opposition. How much do you want?\" \" I have been to very considerable expense,\" said Mr. Biteum. \" Yes, I know. But what will you take to withdraw? Will fifty pounds satisfy you?\" \" I do not want to be unreasonable,\" said Mr. Biteum. \" I will take fifty pounds.\" \"Very well. Then, upon with- drawing your opposition, I will pay you that amount. I will explain to the meeting, and you can express yourself satisfied.\" As they re-entered the room, all the faces were turned to them. They took their places one on each side of the chairman. They both sat with their eyes bent upon the ground, as if in thought. A cry of \" Chair, chair !\" was raised. Mr. Goader rose and said, \" Though I could not give this meeting the explanation I have given Mr. Biteum, without a breach of professional etiquette, yet I think Mr. Biteum is now satisfied that bank ruptcy is the proper course to take, and that I have hitherto conducted the case to the best of my ability.\" Mr. Biteum"], [355, "MEETING OF CREDITORS. 347 bowed assent to this statement. \" Then,\" said the chairman, \" we have now nothing to do but go home.\" \" Nothing ! This is a pretty go,\" said the creditors. \" We have all come here for nothing.\" \"But they are not,\" said a surly and ill natured creditor."], [356, "348 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTEK XLIX. STARLIGHT. It is night. All is silent. Man has retired from bis labour. The .winds of heaven are gone to rest and all is still. The stars, the everlasting stars, fill the sky. When life departs from the body so quietly that man cannot say it is gone, he holds a feather before the gate of the soul ; if the feather be moved ever so gently he knows that life has not yet gone to that unknown world into which all spirits go. But if the soft down of the swan were held to the night it would droop its filaments. All is so motionless and still. It is not the stillness of death which reigns ; nor is its sable pall thrown over the departed day. But another scene of glory has come into the sky, bespangled with the jewels of night. All around are scattered those everlasting diamonds which tell of immensity beyond the ken of man, or the utmost reach his soul cau make. If the sage who looks at this glory, and reads some of the stories it tells, were gifted with the celestial powers of an angel, he could see further into immensity, and by seeing further, would see more of its glory. Had he the magic power to wing his flight to yon far distant star, whose twinkle be can just discern, he would see from that heavenly vantage ground, glory upon glory. Yes, an overwhelming immensity of glory. If from tbat vantage ground he could again wing his flight to a new point which had come into view, as far away as was the world upon which he stood from that to which be had flown, there he would be surrounded by an immensity of glory. Yes, glory upon glory. Those who have devoted their days and nights to this study say that every star is a sun, around which worlds like ours circulate. Yet feeble man lifts his head and says, \" All this grandeur was made for me.\" Had he the right spirit he would"], [357, "349 STARLIGHT. bow his head in silence before the awful presence of his God. Yet there are men \u2014 at least so called \u2014 who can watch this scene and say there is no God. They look at this graudeur as do the wolves, and howl. But had they truly the soul of man, and the power to read its story, how would they be humbled within them, and bow with humility and fear before its awful presence. On the marble monuments of Persepolis \u2014 which are the ruins of temples, an ancient civilisation erected in its days of pride, to perpetuate the memory of its heroes \u2014 there are cuniform marks which men have looked upon for ages, and thought them the fantastic ornaments whieh pleased the people ot by-gone times. It was left for our own day to discover that they were not ornaments, but written characters iutended to immortalise the memory of men who once strutted through tbe world in kingly greatness. Look above at the stars of night which bespangle this canopy that bends over all, and say are they but the ornaments of that vast temple ; or does it require the fire of genius and the tongue of an archangel to tell the story they nightly sing to man. There is no land which doth not hear the song, and no language in which it cannot be understood. How still and beautiful is the night. No wonder that tbe rapt poetry of the past called those stars the pavement of heaven. Hark ! It is the sound of distant music sweetly mellowed by the stillness of night. It is a chorus of men, like a chorus of angels, singing a jubilate in the temple of God. How sweet is the strain. How overwhelm ingly beautiful is the hour and the song. Methinks it is now that man should give thanks that he hath the power to look at this scene and understand some of its greatness. Methinks that the wise men of old, who lived before God revealed his ways to man, might have looked upwards when the stars shone out as now, and seen something of bis greatness. Metbinks that when that sage invented the religion, which in further Inde rules the minds of men, he looked upon scenes like this and saw the quality of greatness and mercy which pervades all like a soul, and thought that was the soul of the universe, and God was the soul of tbat soul. There is not a star that shines but sings a song of glory. Nor those far distant myriads \u2014 so far away that their light is but a milky glare \u2014 but join the everlasting song. Methinks it was a scene like this which taught the old world the"], [358, "350 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. belief that the spirits of the blest came to this earth again to look upon its beauty, for surely heaven cannot match the beauty of the night. Methinks it was a scene like this which made the sweet singer of Israel pour forth his raptured song. Methinks it was a scene like this which made the old world teach that night was the lime for wisdom. Methinks that before this earth was made and hurled into space, those stars sang their song of everlasting glory ; and when this world shall be folded as a robe, they shall sing of glory. It was fabled of old that there were stars which would not join the general Hymn of Praise, so they were cast from the plains of bliss. It was fabled of old that there were men who could look abroad upon the earth and hear no voice ; who could stretch their vision across the broad ocean and see nothing but a waste of waters ; who could look up to heaven and hear no song ; so they were transformed into the Simian race. They have the form of man, can chatter like man, but have not his intelligence. There are men who do so now. No voice speaks to them ; they hear no song or heavenly har monies, and see not the soul there is in all things ; they walk the earth and never look to heaven ; they go down to the grave, and the beauties of the temple through which they have passed, for them have shone in vain. O for the tongue of a seraph, to sing the glory of the stars who march through the sky and carry aloft the banners of God. O for the vision of an archangel to penetrate immensity ; and the emotion of a cherub to bow before its everlasting grandeur. Following this train of thought, I wandered to Old Joe's cot tage almost insensibly. I stepped in to see the old man, and enticed him unto his seat where I had heard him say that he sat to contemplate the things around him. 1 had become charmed by his great simplicity, and being full of the beauty of the starry firmament, I called his attention to the magnificent scene which had so stirred my enthusiasm. As we sat down together, he an old man and I a young man, I was struck with the thought, how differently age and youth look at the same thing ; to the young man all is novelty, and his want of understanding excites doubts and speculations ; the incomprehensible phenomena by which he is surrounded he speculates upon in a tone of unbelief, and feels proud of that superiority which he thinks confi-"], [359, "STARLIGHT. 351 deuce gives him over the hesitancy of age and experience. The young profess to believe nothing which they cannot understand, and will pin their faith to that of no man Age is all faith \u2014 superstitions if yon please \u2014 and has no confidence in tbe philo sophical jargon which so pleases the young. These characteristics were very fuliy developed in Old Joe. He spoke of speculative subjects so far as he understood them with diffidence j but of those which had come under his own observation he spot : and with confidence ; and he was always ready to instil the lessons whieh the experience of a long life had taught him into all with whom he came in contact.

When I was a little child, Master John, I thought my father's house a great place, and my sal her's street, a very large street, and my father's town, a very large town. When 1 was a hoy and came here I thought it a very, very great place ; but when I stood upon the beacon atBarr, and looked all round as far as the eye could see, I thought what n large country my nation was ; but I am told, Master John, that no man can see this nation at one view, like we see the land round Burr, it is so large ; but if the world could be spread out bifore us like a map, Master John, what a very, very large plain we should think it to be. We could not see it at once ; we have not the power ; if the atmosphere was as clear as glass, Master John, we could not see it. Master John, look at that star, just beside the North star\u2014 that very little one \u2014 can you see it P\" \" Do you mean that little starchy-looking light P\" said I; \"Is that a star P I do not see it twinkle.\" \" Look again, Master John,\" said Old Joe ; \" My eyes are old now, but when I was young as you I could see it twinkle, and I'll be bound it twinkles now. I can depend upon the stars, they always twinkle, and are always to be found in the place where they were first placed.\" \" Yes,\" said I, \"I can see it twinkle now, some times I cannot see it, and then again it twinkles. How small it is.\" \" Master John, I am told that is a sun as large as ours. What a long way it is off.

When, Master John, I hear some of these young men talking about these things, as if they knew all, and could tell our Father how He should have ordered His house, and where He should hang His pictures, I have been sorry for them, for they have been so foolish, and, I have thought, wicked, Master John.

Now, Master John, what do I see. I take that seed in my hand and pull it to pieces, and I see it divides into halves, and between them is a little point.\" \" Yes,\" said I; \"the germ.\" \" M hat do you call it ?\" said he. \"The germ.\" \"Well, that little point selects what it wauts. I could not select it, and you could not select it, and I suppose there is nobody who evtr lived that could select it. Yet that little point does it, and builds up a plant like its parent. There is a plan in every seed, and every- seed has the same plan. There is nothing, Master John, done at random, and those stars are not tossed about at random. Master John, these two halves of the seed which have the germ between them, con tain the nourishment to support the infant plant until it can strike out its roots to nourish itself. Master John, the egg contains a point, like the germ of the seed, which is the beginning of the young bird, and all the rest of the egg is for nourishment ; and, Master John, when the little lamb is born, it runs straight to its mother's duds for nourishment, and its mother's duds contain milk for its nourishment. It is the same plan, Master John, and the same mind must have made that plan. It cannot be accident ; there are too many things alike, and too many things apparently unlike, which must happen together to produce that likeness for it to be accident. Master John, that field yonder,\" as he said so, he pointed to what was then called the hilly field, \" is covered with a carpet of grass ; if lambs were put upon that field they would grow up to sheep, and become tbe parents of other lambs, which would grow up to other sheep.

Master John, this is not accident ; it happens too regularly, and makes too few mis takes, to be accident. Master John, if you and I were to take that grass, and toss it about for ever, we should never toss it into a lamb, nor even into a grasshopper. No, Master John, there are no accidents in God's works ; they happen too regularly, and are too much alike, to be accident. There is the same plan in everything, and it must have been one mind which made them. Master John, if you or I could, with the file and the lathe, make a little toy of a machine wbich could sing like a bird, all the people would come to see it, and think us great men; but, Master John, here are birds which can sing better than that toy, who can jump about and fly from place to place, can feed them selves, build nests, love each other, feed their little ones, and fight for them ; and we do not think so much of the Maker of them as we do of the maker of the toy which cannot even sing its little song without winding up. We are thoughtless, Master John, and we walk through the world without thinking. Master John, it was the same mind which made those stars which blaze through all the immensity which stretches above and around us, as made the little birds, and gave them the instinct to build themselves nests in which to lay their eggs, and spotted those eggs all alike, Master John. It was the same mind which gave those birds that love of their young, which makes them fight for them ; and, Master John, that mind must have a kind heart, or it never would have filled its children with so much kindness. Instinct, Master John, is the voice of that mind, and all instinct is but another word for kindness. Master John, you may depend upon this, those stars are not thrown about at random ; there is a plan in them, though"], [363, "STARLIGHT. 355 we do not see it.

The old man sat and listened to them \u2014 intently listened to them. There song was not a mere combination of sounds succeeding each other ; but there was a sweet melody in it \u2014 the pouring forth of some master mind who felt the sentiments the song expressed ; it was not the vulgar noise of a musician seeking praise, but the out pourings of a devout soul, so grand and so solemn, as if he felt in awe of the Being in whose presence his song was to be sung. The old man listened with rapt attention. \"Master John,\" said he, as the song ended, \" those young men sit upon the stile and sing tbat hymn in nights which are moonlight or starlight like this, and the echo, like a thing of life, returns the melody. Master John, if they could read my heart, they could tell how fondly it re-echoes that beautiful strain. Music in the night, Master John, to me is heavenly ; it is like the incense of praise, on the wings of which our prayers should ascend to heaven.\" I shook hands with the old man, wished him good night, and went to join the singers, who were making the echo reverberate with the jubilate."], [364, "356 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER L. COMPLAINTS In the morning Mr. Mincher was waiting in Mr. Goader's office ; formerly when he entered the clerks were all deference ; they left their seats and gave him a chair near the fire ; they readily acquiesced in any remark he made ; they laughed at the slightest appearance of a joke, and thought all his sayings uttered with the slightest appearance of solemnity were aphorisms of wisdom. Now thev lifted their heads, then returned to their work, and took no further notice of him. If he spoke to them they did not hear him ; he was left to seat himself or stand as he thought proper. His wit might have been of the brightest lustre, it would attract no attention ; bis wisdom might have been profound \u2014 he was poor, and no man noticed it. He was a bankrupt, and there were none so poor that they would bend the knee to him. He had learned the bitter lesson that men worship wealth, or its appearance, and turn their backs upon poverty with silent con tempt. Doors that were once opened to him wide and with the heartiest welcome, were now closed, with the message that \" the master was not at home.\" Men who would lift their hats to him when he was rolling in his carriage, now passed him, so intent upon looking at the ground, that they did not see him. He had learned of what value was the homage of man. While the statue is on the pedestal all men turn to it with reverence ; when it is overturned every little soul spits upon it. When tbe hero rides in tbe car of victory all men doff their hats and shout their plaudits ; when he 13 defeated he may lean upon his sword and grieve, for no one speaks to him of comfort. If he die in the arms of victory a nation's tears are shed ; if victory deserts his standard he may fret his great soul away, none will shed a tear"], [365, "COMPLAINTS. 357 for him. When Mr. Goader entered he merely looked at Mr. Mincher, then spoke to the clerks ; having finished his con versation with them he turned to Mr. Mincher and said, \" Do you want to see me?\" \"I did,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Tuen walk into my office, and take a chair, aud I will step iu directly,\" said Mr. Goader, at the same time pushing his office door open. This reception was so widely different from what tbe re ceptions had formerly been that Mr. Mincher was greatly vexed, and the spitting propensity which he had, broke out without control. Formerly, whenever he had been to the office, Mr. Gcader always advanced two or three steps to meet him, holding out his hand in the most frank and cordial manner ; now he was barely civil. Mr. Mincher's pride was indeed humbl=d ; his former friends turned their backs upon him ; the few who remained spoke to him and of him with the insulting terms of pity. The men who in tbe days of prosperity doffed tht-ir hats to him, and addressed him in humble voice, now stared at him and laughed a laugh of triumph. So it will alwavs be. W hen the king is dethroned but few courtiers attend has levee, and the spirit of a courtier is as much in the world as it is in a court. When Mr. Mincher entered he went to his desk and read his letters, he made several memorandums in a book in which he entered his fees, and wrote a letter. When he lighted the taper for the purpose of sealing the h-tter, he said, \" W ell, Mr. Minchtr, what is vour business?\" While the business was being stated he went oa melting the wax and sealing the b-tter. \" I have come to complain of the conduct of these bailiffs,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Why, what has happened ?\" \" 1 hey bave taken all my books and papers.\" \" Yes.\" \" Not only the books and papers belonging to the trade, but all my books and papers.\" \" Well,\" said Mr Goader, answering bim without any expressions of surprise, and in monosvdabb-s. \"lhe books wbich contain my private memorandums.\" \"Yes.\" \"And my letters, which have nothing to do with my trade at all.\" \"Well.\" \"Aud they have not only done so, but they have stopped my letters at the post office.\" '\u2022 Yes.\" \" And they will not allow me to see any of them.\" \"Have your letters addressed in some other name, and to some other place.\" \" But what business have taey to inquire into my private affairs ?\" \" A bankrupt has no"], [366, "358 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. private affairs ; he is supposed to disclose everything to his assignees, and his assignees take possession of everything. Your wife's settlements are not yours, but the property of her trustees for her use; all your property that was is the property of your assignees, and, for the time, you are the recipient of your wife's charily. The law will not give you as much as will buy you a mouthful of bread ; you are stripped of everything but the clothing, without which it would not be decent for you to go about. Your creditors may have lost but ten shillings in the pound, you have lost everything. Your creditors seem as though they would be very severe with you, but the law has no pity ; you are stripped of everything. There is no use to complain. You see, now, the wisdom of taking care of yourself. You will be required to pre pare a balance-sheet, which I advise you to attend to as soon as you can. Prepare it, and the opposition will be appeased ; leave it undone, and the opposition will be fierce. The law is utterly absurd to require these things from the bankrupt, and at the same time strip him of the means of meeting its requirements. Now, I advise you to let Mr. Duston prepare the balance-sheet ; he is acquainted with these things, knows what the Court requires, and the Court will admit what he prepares without challenge, except as to items, upon which you will have to answer such questions as shall be put to you. Now, this will be the value of those questions : We all of us advise our clients to take care of them selves \u2014 when I say us, I mean us legal gentlemen ; and there are certain items in a bankrupt's books which we advise to be cooked, and it is by cooking those items that a bankrupt obtains the means of meeting his difficulties. Whenever we are engaged in opposition, we fix upon those items, and endeavour to discover the cooking ; if we make the discovery we do not consider it a triumph over the bankrupt \u2014 for, poor fellow, there is no merit in obtaining a victory over him \u2014 but a triumph over the bankrupt's attorney, and we laugh at his clumsiness, and at the same time gratify our clients. Now, if we were not in the habit of cooking these things we should not know where to look for the cooking. To be plain with you, it is setting a thief to catch a thief. Bear this principle steadily in mind. The property you had has gone from you ; in connection with that property you are nobody ; the Court takes it and administers it ; the Court has no feeling, and will"], [367, "359 COMPLAINTS. not recognise any of your feelings. You are, for the time being, nobody \u2014 at least your opinion will not be taken on anything. You will have to defend your proceedings, and the various theories the opposing attorneys may form of your proceedings, no matter how wide of the truth those theories are, nor how utterly destitute of foundation they may be; your position gives them the power of assailing you, and you must defend yourself from their assaults. If you are not ready in your answers, even to what has nothing whatever to do with your case, the Court will adjourn the hearing for further information. As a rule we want adjournments, they mean extra fees to us ; and the creditors are so blinded by the sense of injury, they do not think, or they would see that every adjournment lessens the fund from which the dividend has to be made. ' What,' you will say, ' will you have the ends of justice set aside because of the expense ? ' Fiddle-de-dee. What are the ends of justice in a bankrupt's estate ? To divide as much as you can, and as soon as you can, among the creditors. If a bankrupt does what is wrong it is oftener from want of experience \u2014 the horrors of poverty, which his imagination conjures up, or bad advice \u2014 than from any really bad faith on his part. He must defend himself from his own actions, no matter who advised them. You have not been in the habit, perhaps, of noticing the results of the various adjourn ments the Court is always so ready to make, as a tradesman should be, or you would see that they very seldom are productive of any benefit to the estate. Indeed, I may safely say this, that if a tabulated statement were made of the gains made by adjournments \u2014 and whenever there are any we always cackle well about them, we let the world know of our discoveries ; we are not given to be modest in such things. We like the merit, or rather I should say, the fees, too well to be modest; \u2014 I siy, if a table were made of the gains, and an opposite one of the expenses, the additional expenses incurred by adjournments, the gains would be but as the miller's sample, and the expenses as the bulk of the bargain. And then, upon a plea of justice, how often is a bankrupt punished, or rather prosecuted ? Not one in ten thousand. There is usually nothing to discover but misfortune or misman agement. When a man is conscious of crime he runs away ; he does not stop to be a poor bankrupt ; he gathers together all the"], [368, "360 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. spoils he has made, and seeks safety in some other land.\" \" What you say,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" now I am entering upon the experience, I see to be true ; I am as it were outlawed. Have I no rights ? \" \" For the time you are outlawed, and until you get your certificate you have no rights except the right to suffer and be badgered.\" '\u2022 What can I do with the fellows in my house; those vulgar bailiffs? \" \" Submit.\" \"They eat up my food ; what am I to do ? \" \" Submit ; they have no right to do so, but submit.\" \" My wine is all gone ; what must I do ? \" \" Have they had your wine?\" \"They have cleared my cellar, and left me nothing but empty bottles.\" \" Then they have done it jolly ; they have no right to do so. They have no right to a bed to sleep upon, or a chair to sit upon; they should find all they want ; but I do not advise you to press this ; there are some rights it is better never to enforce. There are rights for both parties, and there are annoyances for both parties ; and the annoyances often more than balance the rights. I advise you to let them accommodate themselves, and submit. Treat it as a disease you cannot help, but must endure. If you complain to the Court the Court will say, 'I will take care that my officers do not abuse their powers,' and that is all. In these cases I advise my clients to submit ; they get on so much more smoothly. The men, I dare say, are vulgar fellows ; but you cannot expect gentlemen to follow such a calling. If there is nothing very outrageous, submit.\" \" What,\" said Mr. Mincher, in astonish ment, \"are they masters in my house? \" \" I have already said you have no house; your assignees are tenants to the landlord.\" \" Then,\" said Mr. Mincher, with much feeling, \" must I con sider myself homeless and abandoned ; an outcast among the people who once fawned upou me, and as a naked wretch who wanders from parish to parish deprived of all sympathy except that of wretches as destitute and forlorn as himself; a living scarecrow, persecuted by every puffed-up constable, and hunted from tything to tything ; a thing upon which to hang rags, and to charge upon all the petty thefts of the parish \u2014 a very, very wretch?\" \" You put it rather strongly, Mr. Mincher ; but that is just the position in which the law places you. I do not suppose the law makers had that idea in their minds ; indeed, I am pretty certain they had not. They did not suppose that any"], [369, "361 COMPLAINTS. one would be so foolish as not to take care of himself, therefore there was no need to make an enactment directing him to do it.\" \" Then,\" said Mr. Mincher, \"why does tbe law prepare penalties and punishments for doing so, and the Commissioners exp'ess indignant and frowning censures upon those n ho take care of themstlves.\" \"Not for that; but because they have done it so clumsily. Bless the man ! the Commissioners have hearts as tender as any men ; I know some of them whose hearts are overflowing with feeling. 'they are but the mouthideces of the law, and they do but express its language; it is the audience who listen to that language they have to please. Now let me ask you this: have you noticed that at a the-tre the actors address themselves, instinctively address themselves, to such part of the audit-nce from which they expect applause ; and if the audience do not applaud what they say, they will alter what they say until they receive tbe expected plaudits ; if the matter which is put upon the stage is to be improved, it is the audience who are to n ake the im provement. It is no use even for a minister of religion to be continually preaching to his audience that wliich his audience do not approve, for he will soon have no audience to preach to ; it is no use his laying the flattering unction to his soul tbat he will only preach to an instructed audience, as such men are in the habit of doing, and will not use the mountebank tricks which are necessary to popularity ; they must preach to the audience, or they will have no audience. So it is with the law. It is to a very considerable extent made for the audience ; some times by the audience ; but always to the audience. Truth and right are the same in all countries, and the laws should be the expression of what is true and right ; but they vary in every country, that is because they are made to the audience, and for them to be altered or improved. Public opinion must first be improved, for it is upon that they are based, and by that they must be supported.\" \"Then,\" said Mr. Mincher, \"I must 6ubmit. I must stand by and see all wasted by you legal gen tlemen.\" \" Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed Mr. Goader, \"lay it all upon us, but do it truly ; do not say waste it. We do not waste it, we take it to ourselves and use it. Your creditors cannot agree among themselves about it, so we like their disagreements and"], [370, "362 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. take the property to ourselves and use it. I hope there is no one in my profession but has seen too many examples of the con sequences of wasting property ever to waste it when he can put his hands upon it. We take care of it when we get it. Ha, ha, ha, waste it, indeed ! \" \" Well, well,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" I must stand by and see all the property that was mine go into the hands of\" the lawyer, the Court of Bankruptcy, aud of the various persons who are officers of the Court.\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Goader, \" what of tbat? we cau take care of it. Your creditors cannot agree. Your property must not be thrown in the street ; it would be a bad example; the public would scramble for it, and pretty well if we scramble for it \u2014 we are quite enough without introducing low people to join in the spoil. There is that wire-drawer, he seems inclined to give a deal of trouble. Have you offended him at any time ? \" \"I am not aware of it.\" \"You must have done so; just thiuk awhile. His conduct is more like the conduct of a mail who has received a personal slight or offence and seeks the opportunity of revenging himself.\" \" I do not know anything of that kind,\" said Mr. Mincher. \" Then whatever can make the man act in the passionate and unreasonable way he is doing ; his conduct will assist him in no way. Well, well,\" said Mr. Goader, at the same time shaking his head and spreading out his arms, \" he has got to learn a very expensive lesson ; the sooner he learns it the better for him self. I think we must make him assignee to some estate where there are no effects, and then make him pay all the expenses \u2014 it will ba a good lesson to him.\" \" He came as soon as I had determined to become a bankrupt and wanted payment of his account. I declined to pay him. He then wanted goods. I de clined to let him have goods, and he became very violent and expressed himself in unmeasured terms. I did not quarrel with him ; I disdaii ed to be disturbed by the passion of such a man.\" \" I see now,\" said Mr. Goader, \" how it was ; we must not neglect him ; he has now the opportunity to give you much annoyance It is true that his conduct at the meeting of credi tors has put him in the wrong, but yet your position is such that anything which is said of you, no matter how false, will re ceive attention and belief.

It is true the falsehood may last but for a day, but that may be the day upon which you may want to do the business for which it has been invented. The business over, you need not listen to the refutation, but treat it cavalierly and say, ' You did not believe it when you heard it.' Now you must circulate the report that the wire-drawer wanted you to give him property i_s security and that you refused, for you saw no way out of your difficulties but bankruptcy, and you were determined to give no advantages to any creditor, but as misfortunes had overtaken you all should share alike ; it was your duty under the circumstances, and you must take the con sequences.

Do you remember a thin little man who lived in King Street, opposite the chapel? He was very thin ; his clothes seemed to fit him very easy indeed, and yet he was thin. He wore thick woollen black cloth ; his leggings, which he wore winter and summer, were buttoned to his smalls behind with a loop, a strap also passed round the top of them. It seemed as if the natural warmth which keeps up the temperature of the body was deficient with him, and much wool and loose clothing was required to preserve what little vital beat he made. When you shook hands with him his hand felt dry and skinny, like parchment; his chin was sharp, his lips thin, and rather blue; his cheeks sunken; his cheek-bones stood out like two knobs, and were of a deep red \u2014 almost the colour of livrr. His eyes were round and piercing, but deeply sunken in his head ; his forehead was low, round, and overhanging; his head was bald and shiny; there was no hair upon it except a lit tie margin from ihe crest of his ears to his ntek; what little hair he had was a light brown \u2014 his bead being so bare yon could si-e ils shape \u2014 it was shallow, but round and full; upon the top of it, where phienologists say the organ of self eslemi is, there was a flat, wliich you could cover witb the palm of vour hand, showing that in the language of phrenology self esteem was absent. It might be so according to that science; but it was not so in the man, lor he bad much sell-esteem. \" Say, nay, trir, you are wrong there; his self-esteem might be deficient, but his love of appiobation was largely drveloped.\" \" Ay, ay, you phienologists are never at fault, it is always either Scylla or Cbarybdis \u2014 if it is not one thing it is another.\" When he spoke his speech was rapid and his language decisive ; his mind was full of information \u2014 his powers of calculation were immense ; he could tell the distance of the heavenly bodies, and"], [373, "THE ACCOUNTANT. 365 solve any problem in the mathematics \u2014 he found no difficulty in any \"of the propositions of Euclid ;\" he had more than once almost squared the circle, and divided 4 by 3 to its half millionth decimal place ; all the queer questions in arithmetic which float about society he had more than once solved, and decided many wagers thereon ; he was well up in the mysteries of double entry; he said that system was perfect, and that it was impossible for a servant to cheat his principal under it, and if one did cheat, he contended it was not the fault of the system, but because the system was violated ; he would put his finger on the fraud and say, \" Look here, Sir, if those entries had been properly made the fraud would have been detected instantly. Such is tie perfection of the system, Sir, as I keep it, that I could tell if you had only been robbed of the twentieth part of a farthing.\" In former years he was a schoolmaster, and a right good dominie he was. If he had have had a salary of one thousand five hundred pounds a year his fame would have extended all thn ugh the three kingdoms, for he could give the boys such lessons that the sharpest had some difficulty in learning them, and those he could not he used to birch well. His scholars had many fundamental reasons to know that he was a right good school master. Had be had one thousand five hundred pounds a year, and the power to give a good dinner, what a wonderful fame he would have had ! Perhaps there might have been a statue erected to his memory. Who knows ? As it is, I am obliged to give a minute description of the man, or you would not rememlier him. However great his fame might have been in his day, there is very little of it come down to this. At tbe time to which I wish to call your attention he was not a schoolmaster, but an accountant. He had, by gradual means, got into that pro fession. First he had the books of a small tradesman to extricate irom confusion ; then he had to examine those of several master manufacturers, who had risen from workmen, and had not sufficient learning or confidence in themselves to check the clerks they were compelled to employ; but at tbe time at which we are speaking be was in full practice as an accountant, and had been so for several years. Green trees, gravelled walks, and grass plots had not then come into fashion, but professional men had their offices in some part of their residences. They passed the"], [374, "366 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. whole of the day in those offices, and their evenings at Lyndon's, the Eagle and Ball, or at Poet Freeth's, according as they belonged to the high or the low party. In those days, when members of the low party became rich, \" they must be nobby,\" so deserted their colours, and went over to the high party by some logical process peculiar to themselves, changing politics and religion at the same time \u2014 a psychological phenomena the logicians have not sufficiently investigated. Mr. Duston, with whom we are now concerned, had the two front rooms of his dwelling occupied as offices. On the door of that on the right hand of the hall was painted, \" Clerks' office and waiting room,\" on the left, \" Mr. Duston, private.\" Mr. Duston was sufficiently acute to know that a great man was much greater when there was some difficulty to get at him. How much more likely to cure are salts and senna when prescribed by a physician who has a footman at the door with large calves in side white stockings, than by a poor surgeon who compounds the medicine himself. In Mr. Duston's office there was a large square table, with a margin of three inches of mahogany at its edges, the rest covered with black leather. There were shelves all round the office, filled with journals and ledgers ; many of them were labelled for show, like the coloured glasses in a druggist's windows, as \"Polly's Meadow Colliery Co.,\" \"The Patent Hematite Iron Company,\" \" The Universal Cut Nail and Screw Co.,\" \" The Willstone Banking Co.,\" \" The Double Wick Chandlery Co.,\" \" The Pass Yale Lead Mines,\" \" The Patent Milk Co.\" The prospectus of the last concern lay upon the table, from which it appeared the Company was founded on two principles, which had recently been discovered \u2014 one of them in organic chemistry, the other in mechanics. \" It has been discovered,\" said tbe pro spectus, \" tbat milk is a highly compound fluid, and consists of several bodies which are to be found in great plenty, as caseine, legumine, lactine, oleine, albumen, phosphates, salts, lime, and a few other simple materials ; also, that by putting all these bodies together in due proportions, with a sufficient quantity of water ; that cows being placed to this mixture swallow it with great avidity, and give an enormous increase of milk, so much so, that if the patent milking machine be affixed to the udders, and the machine connected with a steam engine, the flow of milk is con-"], [375, "367 THE ACCOUNTANT. tinuous, aud it is astonishing to see how the animals cock their tails and discharge the surplus water in one unbroken stream. The first issue of shares will be at a pound premium. No further issue will be made except at a premium of five pounds. Application to be made to the Secretary, at the offices of the Company.\" Mr. Mincher entered the \"clerks' office and waiting room.\" The first thing he saw was a piece of dirty paper, over the fireplace, of antique appearance, but in a full bold round hand, containing the announcement, \" That all balance-sheets must be paid for before they are filed.\" So, thought Mr. Mincher, here is another instance how necessary it is for a man to take care of himself. He cannot pass without a balance-sheet in the form the Court prescribes. The law takes all he has from him, yet he must file a balance-sheet, and pay for it before it is filed. If he make the balance-sheet out himself, it is thought to be a cooked document by all parties, and the difficulty of passing the Court is increased. They are uot difficulties a rogue would stumble at, but they are very oppressive to a man who is honest. The clerk was a short, fat man, with very light hair. He had the habit of folding his legs under him as he sat ; and, as he wore spectacles, he had to turn his head full round to see the people to whom he spoke, as he could not see them except through the centre of the glasses. He was a very good tempered little man, and always ready to laugh \u2014 indeed a smile would suffuse his face at the veriest trifle. He had a cheery manner, and was more ready to extenuate a fault than to fiud one. When the ac counts were made out, and the question was put to him, \" Have you discovered his roguery?\" he would reply, \"Those are the accounts, Sir ; I will vouch for every figure being correct.\" He would give no opinion himself, but display the facts very cor rectly. If the party before whom he exhibited the account was suspicious, unforgiving, or severe, he was silent ; but if he were inclined to relent and extenuate misfortune, he would say, \" Yes, I think so; I have found everything straightforward, and was sorry for him. The man seems to have laboured hard, and suffered much. I think his creditors have been hasty with him.\" When Mr. Mincher entered there was a young man in the room, whose accounts were just completed and signed. As he finished the signatures and put the pen into the ink-pot again, he said,"], [376, "368 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" Do you think they will let me go on again ?\" Upon his face there were the lineaments of trouble deeply marked. His clothing was seedy and neglected ; his hat seemed as if it had been wet, and brushed before it was dry. He looked at the clerk, and said with a sigh, \" Do you think they will let me go on again ?\" \" 0 yes,\" said the clerk; \"I should think so. Why not?\" Poor fellow! I knew him when he commenced the business of life on his own account. He was then buoyant and full of hope. He flew at high game ; he matched himself against the first house in the trade to which he belonged, and meant to run them hard. He was determined to drive the world before him. His mind was occupied with the thoughts of men who had made a fortune : he would follow their example, and be a leading man in the town. Poor fellow 1 ambition was his failing. He made a large business, but being greater than his capital could work, his affairs took possession of him, and he was driven, whether he would or not, into the abyss of ruin. He struggled hard and manfully. Money-lenders caught hold of him, and they fleeced him ; lawyers became aware of his necessities, and they skinned him. Poor fellow ! his pride contended to the last. When the bright visions of youth were dashed aside, and he saw that ruin would stalk across his threshold, he sat him down and cried like a child. Poor fellow ! his pride was great, but his abasement was very wretched. Hannibal, in his pride of power, defied tbe Roman Empire ; in his hour of defeat, he sat by Carthage and wept. He said, \" Do you think they will let me go on again? \" The tone in which be said it conveyed a meaning greater than his words. His hopes had been so shattered, he was afraid to hope again ; and it was with an almost hopeless tone he said, \" Do you think they will let me go on again? \" Poor fellow ! hope had not entirely deserted him \u2014 as when does she entirely desert any of us? \u2014 or he would not have asked the question. Poor fellow ! his old troubles had come to a close. He felt as he signed those sheets that they were finished. Then the future, the all important future, loomed upon him, and he said, *' Do you think they will let me go on again ? \" Bear up with a brave heart, and fight the battle of life again. One defeat is not annihilation ; but the lesson a lost battle teaches may turn the next into a victory.

As Mr. Mincher entered he turned round to see who it was, then stepped back a few steps, and made a bow to him. He knew Mr. Mincher as a leading man in the town, aud had heard of his misfortune. He also knew what it was to be unfortunate ; therefore his respect for the man did not follow the colours of fortune, but remained. Mr. Mincher held out his hand to him frankly, for they were fellows. Man does not know what is the sympathy of man until misfortune lays her chilling hand upon him. Before, the \" uses of adversity \" are but language, to which, from fashion or imita tion, he may give his assent. When he is stripped of the adventitious circumstances with which fortune or society has surrounded him, and he is struck down from the station of life to which he had aspired, then he begins to see the uses, and knows they have a blessed effect upon him. Haughty pride flies away, and will follow no banners but those of victory. Superciliousness vanishes like the morning dew ; the hauteur of haughtiness disappears ; he is no longer a being without fellows, haunted by the evil spirit of infra dig., but a man among men \u2014 a being of bis kind, having their sympathies, their feelings, and their socialities. Thoughts, which before he would not deign to look at, because he could not understand them, now visit him with their sweet and welcome influence. Kindness, benevolence, and mercy take up their abode with him ; and lofty and barren pride, as naked and cheerless as a mountain peak which looks down upon the world and frowns, disappears. He left the office with the all-important question, \" Do you think they will let me go on again?\" Poor feliow ! he had a young wile and one child. She had been nestled in the lap of plenty, and cared for as a very precious thing. She loved her young husband, for he was a rran of spirit. When he came home at night, she sang for him as she had used to sing when be was her lover. He was all the woild to her. If he were happy, a world's misery would cast no gloom; if he were sad, a world's happiness tempted her not. He was her husband and her lover, and only when her child was born did she divide her love ; but she said, \" Our babe, George, is not a rival ; it is only a new joy come into my heart ; it is a pledge of love, and an increase of happiness.\" George would say, \"Do not, my dear, be so fond of the child ; \" for she would dress it"], [378, "370 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. like a doll, and load it with all the finery and decorations a young mother's love and wealth could desire or purchase. \" George,\" she would say, \" do not be jealous of our babe, he is your babe as well as mine.\" \" But if anything were to happen to him?\" \" 0 do not think of it, George ; if he were to die my heart would break.\" As misfortune came upon her George, and his heart became heavy, and his brow thoughtful, she thought it was because she was so fond of her child, and that he was jealous of the love she bestowed upon her darling; but when her friends told her of his difficulties\u2014 for he kept his sorrows to himself \u2014 and charged him with deception as to the state of his affairs, she boldly defended him, and would not hear the dearest friend she had traduce her husband and her lover. They said she was an infatuated girl; but she said he was her husband when the sun of prosperity shone upon him, and that he should nestle on her heart, if there were none but hers to shield him from the storm. Her friends might desert her ; she cared not ; he was her husband, and he should be so in the sunshine and the storm. It was the knowledge of this which gave a deep pathos to the question, \" Do you think they will let me go on again? \" Who can tell how many hearts, with feelings as deep as his, have been supported in grief by love as pure and holy as hers. When man is in the world, struggling with his fellow man in the fierce battle of life, who can tell how much comfort there is in a love pure and holy. Mrin may love woman as a mistress ; then all painted toys are alike a passing charm, and no more. He may love her as his wife and his comforter, and then there is a tie of affection which unites heart to heart, which nothing in life can match, and none of the fervid words of poetry can describe. If you have felt this you know the deep pathos of the question, \"Do you think they will let me go on again?\" Ke had not himself merely in his thoughts, when he asked the question, but his dear wife and his young child ; but if you have not known what it is to be in adversity, you cannot understand it, and, therefore, postpone tbe feeling until the time shall come \u2014 and it may do so \u2014 when you shall have to ask the question, \" Do you think they will let me go on again ? \" \" Is Mr. Duston in ? \" said Mr. Mincher. \" What name ?\" said tbe clerk.

He re turned directly, and said, \"Walk in, Sir.\" As Mr Mincher entered, Mr. Duston rose and stood behind his table, and waited for the business to be opened. He merely pointed to a chair, and said, \" Be seated.\" He did not yet know whether it was sternness or complacency which was required of him. Pray Sir, are you married, and entitled to the respectable name of a father, and have you been to the registrar of births and deaths for your district, and heard him enquire, \" Pray, Sir, is it a birth or a death ? ' and have you noticed that he expresses the word \" birth \" with a pleasant smile, and \" death \" with a solemn and mournful visage, equally ready and willing to register either, but only in doubt which face \u2014 a merry or a mournful one \u2014 he is expected to show; if so, you can understand Mr. Duston's state of mind. \" I want you,\" said Mr. Mincher, \" to prepare the balance sheet of my affairs for the Court.\" \" Who is con cerned for you ? \" said Mr. Duston. Now, that is a good ex pression, \" concerned for you.\" There is feeling, anxiety, and sympathy in the word ; \" engaged \" is a mere business ex pression, but \" concerned \" has a larger meaning. \" Mr. Goader has the conduct of my affairs.\" \"Aud you are following his advice in this matter ? \" \"lam.\" \"You are strictly following his advice?\" \"lam.\" \" You have not crossed him with any crotchets of your own?\" \" I have left it entirely in his hands, and have followed his advice to the letter.\" \" Then, Sir, you are a wise man ; he has a large experience in these matters, and is able to give you the very best advice.\" \" The books are in the hands of the Court.\" \" Yes, I know ; you need not trouble yourself about that ; your business shall receive immediate attention. Good morning.\" Now these questions were asked more for the purpose of forming an opinion whether he was to ask for a de posit on account, than for any other purpose. Finding he had left the business entirely in the hands of Mr. Goader, he con sidered it imprudent to ask for a deposit, at least before he had seen Mr. Goader, which he took an early opportunity of doing. He knew Mr. Goader was a wise man, and would not allow his client to be without the means of paying all the expenses he would be called upon to incur."], [380, "372 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTEK LII. RETALIATION. When you have been walking out, did you ever meet a friend who would not see you ? It may be he was so engaged in thought that he did uot see you ; or he may have been arm in arm with some great man, and when he caught a flashing glance of your approach he turned his head another way or looked straight down his nose, for fear a recognition of a person so low as you should demean him in the estimation of the great man with whom he was walking. Have you felt offended at the treatment, and in clined to put your foot in a puddle to spottle him, and thus force an open knowledge of your presence ? Well, now, I have not. I chuckle at this manifestation of character ; I feel as if I had taken the dimensions of the man at once. Years of asso ciation would not give me so great a knowledge of him as that little omission or forgetfulness ; for you know your friend when he next meets you will apologise, and say it was that or something like that, and begs you will not consider it as an intentional slight. I say years of association would not give me so great a know ledge of the man, as that little touch of pride. It tells me at once in what estimation he holds me \u2014 in what estimation he holds himself, and in what estimation be holds the great man on whose arm he is leaning. It is a crucial instance, which settles the point at once. As I consider myself as great a man as any I have ever met (and pray do not you \u2014 honestly now ? ), why I laugh and inwardly chuckle at the presumption. Feel offended ! O, dear no, I never feel offended at the weak minded, they can not help it ; I feel no disposition but to chuckle. If I had auy feeling, it would be that of pity. There was my mother's washer woman, now she had a son who was the favourite clerk of his"], [381, "RETALIATION. 373 employer. His employer was advanced in years, and proposed to retire from business. Having no sou of his own, he proposed to take him in as partner, upon terms usual in such cases ; and he did do so. While he was the son of my mother's washer woman only, he touched his hat when I met him \u2014 when it was proposed tbat he should become a partner, he met me with open hand \u2014 shook mine \u2014 told me of his good fortune, and seemed at once to have become my equal. I was glad of his advancement, and expressed my pleasure in terms equal to the delight I felt. He went on a short visit to the house of his former employer, but then his partner ; that is to say, be dined and supped there one Sunday. When there, he wrote a note addressed to me, dated \" Marchmont House, July 10th.\" I could not for some lime conceive what the note meant. I did not expect one. The contents were trifling, but he was at \"Marchmont House\" \u2014 the honour was new upon him, and he felt proud of bis new fledged greatness. No doubt he for the moment was happy in March mont House \u2014 thought it a part of himself, and wished to be envied. It was a touch of vanity \u2014 the ebullition of a weak mind, whose delight it was to be envied. How proud he must have felt when he wrote \" Marchmont House ;\" as proud as I do when I have a suit of new clothes cut in the very \" tip \" of the fashion. When he met me after this, the washerwoman's son was forgotten. I believe he felt ashamed of his mother. He was a partner in a great mercantile house, having the dignity of Self and Co., and Marchmont House to sustain ; he merely looked solemn, and bowrd profoundly. I did not know what to do; if I did not respect him, I might be considered to insult the firm and Marchmont House. I smiled when he was past, and thought how few there are who can carry honour with dignity, especially when they have not been used to it. v\\ hen I next met him it was \" do John,\" with a lift of the chin, a batting of the eyes, and a patronising manner. Next he passed me and did not see me at all. Next he thought I ought to touch my hat to him. He would see me when I was with great men, for I some times had that honour, but when he was with great men, O dear, how great he was ! He was ashamed of his mother. \" Some men are born to greatness \u2014 some men have greatness thrust upon them,\" but it has at all times seemed to me that"], [382, "374 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. r great men should not be born at all, it is so common an origin ; they should be let down upon the mountain, and their advent announced by a flourish of trumpets. To come into tbe world like a common beggar \u2014 to cry and wear doublets \u2014 to live like the vulgar \u2014 to have the nose wiped and be put to bed, O they are such mean things they are altogether below the dignity of greatness. A great man should be popped on the earth by a puff of wind, ticketed and labelled \u2014 \" This is a great man ;\" for I do believe no one would ever discover them to be so by the merit they possessed, or the talent they displayed. Great men are great in their own estimation, and nowhere else. One day I was passing along the street, deeply engaged in thought \u2014 that kind of thought when the eye seems to look at a person, and yet the mind is so thoroughly intent upon its own musings, that things and persons within the range of sight are not seen \u2014 when the one operation of the mind engrosses all its powers, and objects may come within the range of the senses, yet these sentinels \u2014 these pickets of the soul \u2014 give no signal. I was touched rudely upon the back. I turned round to see who had touched me, and there stood Old Joe, bent with age, his chin hanging so as to show his teeth, which seemed but as two or three discoloured pegs, and with both hands bearing upon the top of his stick ; his hat and dress were of a fashion of the times of old ; his hair limp, white, and stirred by every breath of wind, hung below his hat like a row of silver fringe. He looked at me imploringly as one much hurt, and said, \" Ah ! Master John, I had hoped I was forgiven, and when forgiven I did not think my young master would be ashamed of an old man like me when he met me in places where he could be seen. I know I am old and almost done with, but there was a time, Master John, when I could hold up my head as proudly as auy one ; but I am old now, Master John, and waiting to be sum moned home. But I did not think my young master would be too proud to see me, or be ashamed of me because I am old.\" The old man pulled off his hat and turned it round and round in his hands, and played with the band. I stood looking at the old man, and as I wanted to see another side of his character, to that which I had usually seen, I let him talk. I merely said, \" Joe, I did Dot see you.\" \" Ah ! Master John,\" said he\", \" it's"], [383, "375 RETALIATION. always the way when a recognition is forced upon one, we always say that ' I did not see you.' It is a poor excuse, Master John. I stood here, and you would have passed me without speaking. When I was young, Master John, I did not care who passed me ; if they held up their head, I held up mine ; if they were proud, I was proud as well. Master John, I was in health and vigour, and did not care for them; could throw the qucit, or roll the ball, or run, or wrestle as well as any of them; there were none, Master John, suspected my ability, and if they did, I did not care, I knew I could do it ; but I am old now, Master John ; all these powers have left me. I feel that when I talk of what I could do once, people smile at my boasting, and are willing to humour me because I am old ; but I did not think my young master would pass me and not speak. All my com panions are dead, the friends of my youth are no more, I walk along these streets filled with people, but I feel lonely ; all the faces are new to me ; they were children when I was an old man, and they have no other notion of me but as an old man. Like a ruined castle covered with ivy, Master John, its history is in the past ; and it must be a man with a rich fancy and learned in antiquities who can fill it with the life and gaiety, the fashion aud the beauty which once revelled there. So it is with me ; they look at my bent frame, my feeble body, and these white locks, and think I was always as I am. I have been poor all my days, I have made no mark upon my times, I carry no history upon my forehead, and the story of my life will be buried in my grave. Like the millions of men who have lived in this world, Master John, for a short time a green mound of earth will be raised over me, and then I shall have gone into eternity, and like an un distinguished rain drop, fall into the mighty ocean, no longer having a distinct existence.\" \"But, Joe, you think too seriously of this omission of mine ; I did not see you.\" \" Well Master John, well, if you did not see me you did not. I sup pose I am jealous, Master John, and think I ought to be seen ; a sort of phenomenon which no true friend would fail to see. I am perhaps a vain old man, and think people think as much of me as I think of myself; we are all apt to do that, Master John ; we all think very highly of ourselves, and think the world ought to measure us by our standard, and we are too prone,"], [384, "376 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN.

I feel that I am a poor used up thing, and no matter how soon I leave this world for another.\" \" O Joe, Joe,\" said I, \" do not give way to such thoughts, have not I often heard you say that we put a gloss upon men and things, and as we annotate them, they are to us; that to e;ich of us the world is more what we imagine it to be than what it really is ; that when we are out of health we throw tbe gloom of our own minds over everything, and then think that that gloom is natural to the world ; a blot, a defect, a limitation, or a curse, which a good God has inflicted. Separate what is in your own mind only from reality, and then you will have reason to bless and not to curse. Joe, I think I have heard you say this.\" \" Yes, Master John ; yes, I have, and I know it is true; perhaps, Master John, I am getting peevish as I get old. The novelty of the world having worn off, it has no charms.\" I took him by the hand, I shook it heartily, and said, \" Joe, I did not see you, if I had, I certainly should cot have passed you without speaking.\" I felt hurt that the old man should let such a slight incident start such thoughts, and give so much pain. I took him by the arm and walked up the street with him, and did my best to remove the impression my inattention had made. A few days after this occurrence I was walking along; in the distance I saw Old Joe contemplating a budding then in course of erection, just as I got on a level with him he left off the contemplation and began to move on. I let him just pass me. I then turned and said, \" Now, Joe, I have got to complain of you; you were going to pass me without speaking, and I think it very unkind and very proud of you to treat me with this indifference.\" The old man laughed, with a \" Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,\" but with all his laughing I could see tears come in bis eyes; he said, \" Ha, ha, ha, see, Master John, they are putting up lions to carry that building, and they are not lions, they are only lions heads.

I, \" but that does not explain why you were going to pass me without speaking.\" \" Master John, why do you think they take such a fancy as that ? \" It is high art, Joe.\" \" Then high art must be all a pretence, Master John ; they are stones and not lions. Those flowers they have carved are stones and not flowers. If tbat is high art, Master John, high art is a sham and a pretence.\" \" t ome, come, Joe,\" said I, \" I am not going to let vou side off in that way ; you were going to pass without speaking, and it was very unkind of you \" \" Ah, Master John,\" said he, \" there is a great difference between you and me, you are young and quick, and can see everything ; I am old and feeble, dull of sight and dull of hearing ; there is no wonder that I should not see you. When I was young like you I could see everything ; I cannot now. Do not be too bard upon an old man, Master John, I did not see you.\" Tbe old man took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the tears from his eyes. \" Master John, you have caught me, I know, but do not be too hard upon me. I did not see you, I am sure I did not see you. I would never pass my voung master without speaking.\" He held out his band for me to shake which 1 saw was a little palsied. He shook my hand heartily, with his left hand he wiped away the unbidden tears ; he lifted up his head and looked me full in the face, then said, \" Well, Master John, how are you? You caught me, you caught me, I did not see you. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\" lhe laugh was not the expression of delight or exhiliration, but of pla\\ful chagrin; tbe tables were turned upon the old man, and be felt it. How fast changes lake place, Master John ; it is all change, a continual change. A time was, Master John, when all things remained for generations the same. If a man, Master John, who had been dead and buried for a hundred years, were by some miracle restored to life again, he would know his own town, his own house, his own thatch ; and, though the people might be all gone away and a new generation be living in their place, the thoughts which entertained them, the opinions which guided them, aud the creeds which blest them would be all the same.

I know that my father's cottage, though it was humble and covered with jasmines, and the little birds built in the thatch, Master John, and the swallows came every spring to the old nest; though the moss grew about it and covered it with golden bloom, and the elder tree and the laburnum grew at the gate ; and though that gate had never been painted but was covered with the greenness of age ; yet I know it was a happy home, happier than is this splendid mansion which has had lavished upon it a mine of wealth, and the man who built it went to Greece and Borne to learn how to do it. Master John it is not the house in which a man lives which makes him happy, a merry heart will make any house happy. A man who lives in a house like that has too much dignity, too much pride to be happy. His thoughts are upon how he shall carry himself in accordance with his great house, his mind and his person are put in stilts, Master John, and he must walk in those stilts to preserve his dignity. But a pcor man, Master John, is like a bird when he has picked up the crumbs on which he lives, he can love and be happy ; he is gay as the summer day and happy in his song, and not ashamed that his fellows hear him sing. The rich man pays money, a deal of money, Master John, to hear people sing, and he cannot'tell what has been sung without a book, Master John ; but the poor man sings for himself, and what he sings always comes from his heart. The rich man thinks it beneath his dignity to sing, but the poor man, Master John, sings for himself, and as he carols forth his song his heart gushes with joy. Master John, the world is un dergoing so many changes that I do not know what it will come too. I seem no longer to be wanted here, and must make way for younger and more daring spirits. The world is like a house ; it is being changed, room after room is being changed and re built; things that have done for thousands of years will not do now.

Those were tbe days when every town on tbe road was entered at the sound of the bugle, and left to the same music. W henever a nobleman's seat was passed the guard gave his lordship a rally. Then the coach was a coach \u2014 something to be looked for; some thing to be looked at, and something to talk about ; when a whjle village would turn out at the sound of the bugle, and all the quidnuncs of the town gather round the inn at which it called to hear the news.

The coachman passed, mounted the box, gathered up his ribbons, and, as he took the whip in hand, he gave the guard a very intelligent look, which tbe guard well understood, and pointed with the forefinger of his gloved hand to the gent with the blue bag. The guard took the hint, and looked inside, then said \" All right and com fortable, I hope.\" The coach had got into motion. He stood until it passed him, then ran about three steps, to get his body into the same rate of motion the coach was going, then with hands aud feet climbed up to his seat, drew his bugle from the basket, and played \" Cherry-cheeked Patty for me.\" When he had shaken the moisture from his bugle, and returned it to the basket again, he said, \" Charley, he's a big wig.\" Now it was this which made the^ruard come to the conclusion that he was a \" big wig.\" When lie looked inside to see if they were com fortable, he did so more from curiosity than kindliness, and at the time the gent with the bag was drawing from that bag papers tied with red tape, and parchments sealed with lumps of red wax, on green ribbons. The papers tied with red tape were parch ments in the infant state, aud are called drafts ; their parents, and they have many of them, tie red tape round their waists. Anything may be done with them until they are moulded and licked into shape, but that is almost as difficult a job as naming a child after you have got him. When he is licked into shape, he is transformed into parchment ; he has then several lumps of red wax melted upon him, and several pieces of green ribbon run through him, when he is a very solemn thing indeed. He never dies ; he may be superseded, but he is as immortal as the property about which he discourses with unintelligible verbosity. It was these things being produced from the bag, and made to occupy the other place the gent had taken, which made the guard conclude he was a big wig, and a very philosophical conclusion it was, showing an acutely logical mind on the part of the guard. When the guard said, \" he's a big wig,\" Charley leaned back and turned half way round, so that his ear could see the guard if his eyes could not, and said, \" Is he a six-and-eight-pence or a five"], [392, "384 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. yellow boy ? \" \"A yellow boy, Charley,\" said the guard. \" Six and-eightpence \" was the flash term for a lawyer, and a \" yellow boy \" a councillor ; \" though,\" as Charley said, \" a six-and-eight pence aint as big as a yellow boy, a six-and-eightpence runs up the longest bill \" \"I knowed one,\" said Charley, \"as made a bill as big as a family bible, and had it bound up by a bookbinder. ' Oh,' savs I, when 1 seed it, ' do you think as how anybody will read all that 'ere?' 'I don't want um,' says he; ' I don't want um to read it; I want um to pay it ; and if they'll pay it without reading it all the better for me.' \" Ha, ha, ha !\" laughed Charley. \"Do you know as how that six-and-eigbt-pence charged um a couple of guineas for making out his own bill, and half a guinea for binding it. Ha, ha, hal He was a deep un, he was. I had a gent on the box once as I told that 'ere to, and he said that was nothing uncommon, that wasn't ; he knew a gen'man as had got one in five volumes folio, as he kept among bis curiosities ; but be said as how he never read it, paying it was punishment enough, with out reading it. Ha, ha, ha. Five volumes folio. I told him as how be should teach the youg 'squire to read out on it. There was some good lessons in that 'ere, I'll be bound.\" The day was an autumn day. There were large cumulus clouds in the sky, all black and silver, showing a blue sky through the multitudes of places between the clouds, mottling the landscape near and far away with bright sunshine and dark shade. The harvest was all garnered ; the seared leaves bestrewed the road and filled the ditches ; the sportsman strode along the field and across the moor ; the fieldfare had come from other lands to pass here the approaching winter; and the wild fowl flew high in the sky, like an army varying their evolutions as if they were marshalled and commanded by a chief, nnd telling to the man learned in auguries what would be the character of the coming winter. As the coach entered Duncburch, the passengers, fagged and weary, looked across the extensive prospect there presented to the traveller, and saw the short twilight fall into night. During the time the horses were being changed, the coachman and guard were loading their pistols ready for use ; there was some ostentation in the operation, as if they wanted it to be seen and talked about. As the passengers reseated them selves for the journey there was some quarrelling about who the"], [393, "385 THE TANTIVY. middle seat belonged to. The conduct of the coachman and guard foretold expected danger ; each man's life became of great value to him ; gallantry was thrown aside, and the male passen- gers were not ashamed to thrust the ladies to the outside. \" Now gentlemen,\" said the guard, \" we may meet with some adventures as we cross Dunsmore Heath ; we will therefore put the ladies in the middle, and the gentlemen will, if they please, sit outside. Come, gentlemen, make way. Here, Ma'am, sit here Ma'am. Gentlemen, gentlemen, make way for the ladies ; you would not like the highwaymen to shoot the ladies ; you would rather be shot yourselves, I am sure. Come, gentlemen, make way, make way; let the ladies take their places.\" \" I call all the passengers and the coachman to witness,\" said one of them with great trepidation, \" that I have had this seat all the way down.\" \" Well, what of that?\" said the guard ; \"you will if need be make a barricade of your body to protect the ladies, I am sure.\" \" Would I ?\" said he ; \" who would be fool then ? I have had this seat all the way down, and I mean to keep it to the end of the journey.\" \" But surely,\" said the coachman, \"you will make way for the ladies.\" \"I will make way for nobody; my life is as precious to me as anybody's life is to them, lady or gentleman.\" \" I'll tell you what,\" said the coachman, \" the only time my coach was robbed, the man who sat on that very seat was killed. You see this was the way as how it was; one of the gang had taken a seat behind there, facin' the guard ; when we came to the heath two highwaymen stopped the hosses. We had left our bulldogs,\" said he, at the same time showing his massive pistols, \" at the inn to be cleaned. The landlord had cleaned and loaded them, but some of the gang had been watching him, and took the opportunity of his short absence to draw the charges, and re-load them with horse-dung, so that when we came to fire them off they would not go off, because you see horse-dung is not powder ; so, you see, I leaped down to make them let go my hosse's head, and the guard jumped down to help, and we fought them with the butt end of our pistols, and beat them off; but while we were beating them off, he who sat upon the coach robbed it. He killed the man who sat in your place for the purpose of frightening the rest.\" \" Lord, you don't say so ? \" said the gentleman deficient in gallantry. n"], [394, "386 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. \" I do though ; and it's a fact, and he sat in the place that gentleman sits in who is muffled up in the cloak ; and he was muffled up in a cloak as he is. Wern't he, guard ? \" \"He was,\" said the guard. \" I give one of the fellows a rap over the head as he didn't forget ; but the thief as robbed the coach while Charley and I was fighting, stole my bugle as well. But the bugle was sent to the inn with a very perlite note, saying as how they liked to hear my music, and expressed at the same time a desire that I should play, as I went over the heath, ' It's my delight, on a shiny night, in the season of the year.' They had got a dark lantern, and sometimes, when I have done playing it for them, they pull up the slide of the lantern, and make it wink three times \u2014 I think that means encore \u2014 so I plays it over again. I thinks it better to keep an enemy quiet by playing him a tune than to blow his brains out. They are awkward fellows to have anything to do with, I can tell you. If I was to blow the brains of one of them out, perhaps the t'other would do me ditto ; then where should I be ? As we go over the heath keep a sharp look out, and you will see the lantern wink.\" The winking lantern might be fun to some people, but it was no fun to the passengers when they knew it be longed to highwaymen, who had got blunderbusses which they were prepared to discharge at any one from whom they hoped to gain a few guineas. The ungallant gent asked if there were any room inside. \" None at all,\" said the coachman. \" Let that gentleman put his bag outside ; the life of a christian is of more consequence than the loss of a bag.\" The big wig proposed tbat the lady should occupy the spare inside seat for the remainder of the journey, which offer was accepted, the lady saying \" that gen tlemun was a gentlemun ; the other was a brute \u2014 he positively wanted me to sit outside right over the wheel, and I should have been spottled no one knows where, the ugly brute 1\" The un gallant gent was obliged to occupy the outside seat, but he grum bled, and shut his eye3 as they crossed the heath, and prayed \" that if he must be killed, it would please God to let the high wayman do it while his eyes were shut; it would not be so hor rible then.\" As soon as they approached the heath the guard played with much vigour \" It is my delight, on a shiny night, in the season of the year.\" \"Look out to the left, gentlemen,\""], [395, "387 THE TANTIVY. said the coachman, \" and you will see the lantern wtnk. There it is \u2014 one, two, three.\" \" All right,\" said the guard, \" they shall have it again,\" and he played it again ; for, as he said, \" it was better to please the highwaymen than to offend them \u2014 it is better to pat the lion on the neck than to up with your stick and strike him.\" Now, it is a very strange thing that whenever there is a company of only a few persons there is sure to be one or more who won't believe what they are told \u2014 in fact, who are very infidels. On the coach was one of this class. \" That is no winking lantern,\" said he; \"it's the light from a cottage window obscured by three trees.\" \" Ah ! \" says the coachman, \"I hate such fellows as you are. You won't believe your own eyes. Go home and pray for the Lord to increase your faith.\""], [396, "388 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTEE LIV. THE ARRIVAL. About ten o'clock on the evening of a November night the Tantivy and its four-in-hand, the guard playing \" Home, sweet home,\" drove up with a rally to the Nelson Hotel. The pas sengers were dressed in all manner of costumes, intended more for comfort and protection than for elegance. \" Where is Old Tom?\" said the guard. \"Here I am, Sir,\" says Old Tom. \" Drive this gentleman to Mr. Sparrow's.\" \" What Mr. Sparrow is it?\" says Tom. \"The lawyer,\" said the guard, rather im patiently. \" Don't you know Lawyer Sparrow ?\" Tom shook his head dubiously. \"Where's he live?\" said Tom. \"Well, then,\" said the guard, \"it's old Dickeybird he wants.\" \" Wliy don't you call um by the right names? then a cove could understand yer. Get in, Sir; anything beside this bag, Sir?\" \" Nothing.\" As Tom shut the door, and was preparing to mount his seat, the guard said in a whisper to Tom, \"He's a big wig.\" Tom looked at his \" hoss,\" then at his fare, and then said, \" Is he 1\" Tom turned round to his coach, and touched his hat to the big wig, and said, \" Where do you want to be driven, Sir?\" \" To Mr. Sparrow's, the attorney ; do you know him ?\" \" 0 yes,\" says Tom, \" the fare will be half-a-crown.\" \" Well,\" says the big wig, \"what is the right fare I will pay you.\" Tom mounted his box, and said to himself, \" What is the right fare, eh ? Ah, catch a weasel asleep, or a big wig saying anything as you can hold him by. If Dickeybird's at home, I shall get a shilling ; if he aint, I shall get half-a-crown ; so I hopes as how he aint. I think as how half-a-crown's none too much for me and my hoss. See what a time I've been awaitin' on um ; three-quarters late, and I awaitin' all the time ; half-a-crown's"], [397, "389 THE ARRIVAL. none too much. I wonder if he would wait and work for half-a crown ? Then, why don't he have a fellow feelin'? That's what I say. Do as he'd be done by. He would want a yellow boy for the job. Then why don't he do as he'd be done by, and give me one ? Bight's right ; and as he's a big wig, he should see all on us righted, he should ; right's right, right is.\" Tom drove along very- leisurely until they arrived at Mr. Sparrow's. He then jumped down, and knocked at the door; the servant maid answered the knock. \"A gemman from Lunnun,\" says Tom, at the same time touching his hat, \"has is come in by the Tantivy, Ma'am.\" The girl put the candle down in the hall, and ran to the parlour door, and gave it a gentle rap with her knuckles, then walked in. \"There is a gentleman from London, Ma'am, at the door.\" Mr. Sparrow was out ; therefore the mistress had to give permission for him to enter, and she said, with great lofti ness, \" Ask the gentleman to send in his card.\" Tom stood look ing in the hall, communing with himself in speculations on futurity, fears and hopes alternatively prevailing. \" If he's at home, it's a shilling ; if he aint, it's half-a-crown. I hopes as how he aint.\" \" Ask the gentleman to send in his card,\" said the girl, at the same time aping the tone and manner of her mistress. \" They want your card, Sir, if you please, Sir,\" said Tom, touching his hat to his fare, quite pleased ; for hope had over come fear. Had the master been at borne he would have come to the door himself, \" but he aint,\" thought Tom. \" So the misses wants to know who he is ; it's half-a-crown for a tanner.\" As Tom took the card to the door he tried to read it by the light of the girl's candle. That seemed to be a difficult task, if you were to judge by the number of twirls and twists he gave his head, his mouth moving at the same time as if he were trying to crack a very hard nut, \" Oh, ah,\" says Tom, \" Tertius Sandies, Esq., that's the gemman's card, and the gemman aint a gemman ; he's a squire.\" As soon as Tom found he had a squire's card in his hand he handled it very carefully indeed. He seemed to think it was something that would break. If it had been marked \"glass, this side upwards,\" he could not have handled it more carefully. \" Ah, you see, then a squire was a squire, but now anybody is a squire who can invest a sovereign in the ' double patent manure company ;' then a squire's card"], [398, "390 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. was something, now a squire's card is a bit of double-milled patent gelatine glazed French pasteboard ; then the squire was somebody, and his card was not much, now the card is a highly finished thing, and the squire aint, that's all. The squire and the card have changed places : then any card would do for a squire, now any squire will do for the card.\" As soou as Mrs. Sparrow read the name upon the card, she took the candle in her hand and came out herself to welcome the gentleman. She was a stout woman. I beg her pardon, if she had been alive she would have been offended at being called a woman. She was not a woman, she was a lady. I would be very sorry to offend even the dead. I beg therefore you will mark that she was not a woman. She was a stout lady, with large bosoms pushed up almost to the chin, and her waist under her arms ; her figure from her waist downward was slightly conical ; her neck and arms were bare, and her headdress was large and made up of gaudy materials. She came to the door all smiles, \"Walk in, Sir, walk in Sir; you are welcome from London. Mary, get the gentleman a fire in the blue room ! You see, Sir, etiquette aud the proprieties of society require that a lady should not admit any gentleman into her house in the absence of her husband ; but, you, Sir, I am sure I must apologise for detaining you at the door one moment ; and after so loug a journey too, you must be excessively fatigued ; I hope you left all our friends in London well. John, John, go and look for Mr. Sparrow, and tell him that Tertius Sandies, Esquire, has arrived. I am so sorry that we did not know by what coach you were coming, our carriage should have come for you.\" \" Our carriage\" was a bit of bounce, for they had no carriage ; but a little variation from the truth is a pardonable sin when a fine lady adds to her dignity thereby, especially to a stranger, who is not likely to find it out. Pray, Sir, did you never swell a bit when a stranger came to you, all admiration at your full-blown dignity ? If she had not got a carriage, she was always teasing Mr. Sparrow to set up a carriage ; therefore she should be forgiven that bit of bounce. \" 0 I beg you will not mention it,\" \" Please take care of the mat, Sir,\" said she, holding the candle down so as to be a guide to his feet \" These candles give so poor a light that I am afraid you can scarcely see.\" \" Poor lights, Ma'am,\" said Tertius Saudies, Esq.,"], [399, "391 THE ARRIVAL. \"whether in the street, the world, or the law, more frequently dazzle and bewilder than afford any guidance.\" \" Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed she, \" that is very clever, immensely clever, I must tell Mr. Sparrow of that, he advises his clients to consult the great lights, the luminaries of the law ; that is why he is so successful.\" Tertius Sandies, Esq., bowed and scraped, quite pleased, and said he knew Mr. Sparrow was a man of great discrimination. He might have said so of all branches of the profession \u2014 they see wit and wisdom where ordinary people see nothing, especially when it is their interest to see it. \" Have you the gas here?\" said he. \" We are introducing it. We think it very dangerous though \u2014 it might blow the whole town up. We shall see how it behaves itself before we have anything to do with it.\" \" There is no danger, no danger I assure you. The engineer of the London gas works, a very clever man indeed, one of nature's clever men, a real genius, heard some one remark how dangerous the gas was ; he took a pike out of a workman's hand and with it struck a hole in the gasometer and lighted the gas as it issued from the hole \u2014 a bold experiment, a very bold experiment. The bystanders were alarmed, and ran away ; when they returned they found him standing beside the burning jet of gas with the coolest possible confidence. It was a bold experiment, but it afforded the most conclusive evidence as to its safety. A little time will show that gas is a necessity.\" When Mrs. Sparrow had properly housed the Barrister, for such the big wig was ; she went to Mary, and said, \" Mary, if any letters come addressed to Tertius Sandies, Esq., you will hand them to the gentleman who has just arrived.\" She gave this direction that Mary should tell all the household that they had a \" squire \" in the house. She was proud of the honour ; her notions were all high ; she felt that nature intended her to be an aristocratic lady ; she felt so much at home with them, it was like being in her native air ; there was a delight and a pleasure in it ; she had heard people say that rank was but an accidental circumstance, but she could not believe in that doctrine; she felt that there wa3 something more than that ; she was sure, from her own feelings, that there was a difference of mind, a lofty pride, a purity of blood, an elegance of manners, a chivalric feeling which distinguished high birth, and separated them fully"], [400, "392 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. from low people. So, when any visitors came to see her, she handed them a small biscuit and a glass of wine ; that was genteel and high; low people might like bread and beef; why such should be fed in the kitchen, but high people should be handed on a silver waiter \u2014 plated would do\u2014 a glass of wine and a biscuit in the parlour. You might tell a low person even then, for they crunch the biscuits at once and want more, and chuck the wine off at once and hold out the glass to be filled ; they positively require a pound of biscuits and a pint of wine. While a person of high blood will take the wine with such grace, will hold the biscuit between tbe finger and thumb, carrying the other fingers as far as possible away from it, and will talk most elegantly for an hour and a half before the wine is sipped or the biscuit dis- appears. High blood can be seen even in so small a thing as chew- ing a biscuit. It is delightful to associate with rank, and to have persons of rank for visitors. She had her husband's crest for her seal \u2014 a griffin's head, with a key in its mouth \u2014 and sealed all her letters with large lumps of wax, impressed with that seal. Wafers or other sticky substitutes were low and vulgar. No, no; red wax in ordinary, and black wax in mourning. Attention to trifles distinguishes high birth. Now Tom was just the t'other ; he would soon have finished all the biscuit that was brought him and have asked for more ; and wine ! why he would drink that as long as they would bring it to him. He has often said, that he never had enough of that \" 'ere\" in his life. \"I should like once in my life to have enough, so as how I might say as ho w I was saded. But I can never do that ; I can never be happy and jolly, I can't; I have got to work too hard, and don't get paid enough for it when I've done it, I don't.\" There is another particular which distinguishes high people \u2014 the nick -names they give to each other are honourable additions \u2014 as esquire, baronet, lord, and so on ; and what is more, they have great faith in such names ; they believe in them, and will strive and struggle for them. The common people do not. They call great people pigs, beaks, big wigs, nosey, cheekie, or any other name which will characterise the person they wish to describe. '1 he airs high people give themselves they laugh at as rich matter for fun. When Tom had delivered his fare he went to the Eagle and Ball. He had two objects in view. One was to have a pint for"], [401, "THE ARRIVAL. 393 himself, the other was to pick up some gentleman who could not pick up himself, carry him home, and help to put him to bed, where he would have the pleasure of seeing the four-poster spin round like a top, and make speeches to the company without fear of contradiction. Then he would be a wise man. A man who is never contradicted, or delivers his opinions from a platform where he cannot be, soon flatters himself that he is a wise man. You have no idea how many people are wise because they are not contradicted. Pass them through that ordeal ; and, now I tell you this with the greatest confidence \u2014 and in a whisper \u2014 I hope you will not go telling it agaiir, making mischief, the truth always makes more trouble than false opinions do; you can afford to laugh at, and despise the latter, but the former you must combat, and deny \u2014 and \u2014 yes \u2014 and they are nothing. Now, when a gentleman is so far gone that he can see and feel his bed spin round, he can make what speeches he likes, aud no oue con tradicts ; or, he can sing a song or drink a sentiment, and pass everything unanimously, especially if he happens to be by himself. When a man is by himself, then he can have his own way, and ought to be happy ; though I believe there are some people who are not happy because they have nothing to tease them. Tom got his pint of ale. \"Mr. Blunt, Mr. Twittles, and gemmen all, here's to your very good health. Any gemman want my services to-night ? \" \" Thank you, Tom, thank you.\" \" Well, Tom,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" had a good day, Tom?\" \"These aint good times, these aint. Gemmen walk home, gemmen do.

Has Sparrow got him ? Then he is retained for the wire-drawer. Sparrow is one of the closest and keenest lawyers in the profession. You do not see his work, nor know that he is at work, until all is ready and ripe. Then he pounces upon you like a hawk, and wins by the suddenness of his swoop, rather than by merit or talent.\" \"Why is the wire-drawer so bitter?\" said Mr. Blunt. \"He wants to be paid,\" said Mr. Twittles ; he wants to have his money ; he will take it in stock or in property. He knows that all is now in the hands of the Court, but thinks Mr. Mincher has got a nest somewhere, and he wants some of the eggs. His plan is one of great risks, but it often succeeds. He will oppose Mr. Mincher at every turn. He will put him to every possible expense. He hopes he may be bought off. There is many a poor man makes promises to abate the opposition, which keeps him poor all his life, if not worse. As soon as he has got through one difficulty, and begins to get his house in order once again to struggle with life, the man to whom he has made the promise \u2014 he is always an un merciful man \u2014 comes down upon him and again strips him, perhaps breaking his spirit for ever, and making him a reckless vagabond.\" \" Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr. Blunt, \"you do not mean to say any Court would assist unfeeling men in such schemes.\" \" It is the object of all of us not to show the game, but to worry by groundless objections, and starting theories it is at the moment impossible to refute, to give a colour for adjourn ments, and by wearying delays, by creating disappointments, by dashing the cup of hope from the poor devil's hand when he is about to drink it, to create such a feeling of wretchedness, that any demand will be complied with to remove the present pressure, no matter what future misery it may introduce the man into.\" \" Surely, Mr. Twittles, you do not mean to say that? \" \" I do though,\" said Mr. Twittles. \"And do you mean to tell me that any Commissioner will sit upon the seat of justice with"], [403, "THE ARRIVAL. 395 great gravity and help such inhumanity ? \" \" Mr. Blunt,\" said Mr. Twittles, seriously and earnestly, \"there are too many of the Court, and about the Court, who gain by these wearying delays, and whose interest it is to conceal the object of the opposition. Every delay and every step means money to them, if it means sorrow to others. The money they have the pleasure of receiving ; the sorrow is borne by others. They may see the wretched and haggard look, and the abject deportment, but they know not the pang which rankles in the soul of the poor and despised victim. The Commissioners have large incomes, which it has been the object of a long life to obtain, and was the prize they aspired to when they were briefless barristers. Their comfortable position banishes all thought of the misery or the sorrows of others. If those about them gain what was once the object of their aspirations, they are rather gratified than grieved, and do not think of the means by which the gains are made. The conduct of the Court is too much like a game of chess, in which the object of every move is concealed, and the real attack disguised, until the victim is well in hand ; then open upon him and he is crushed. No matter what deceptions are practised ; if they do not contravene the rules of the game, or the rules of the Court, they are allowed and supported. The Court may be well aware that the result is injustice and oppression on the one side, and large gains on the other ; but if all the forms have been observed, injustice and oppression gain the verdict.\" \"And, Mr. Twittles, do you mean to say a rogue should go free because of the expense?\" \"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Twittles; \"but it is the object of a rogue to study all the forms which the law requires of him, and so to play his game that those forms are complied with, just as it is the object of the housebreaker to study the habits of the family into whose house he desires to enter, so that he may rob with impunity. The Court is a relief to a rogue, for it stands between him and the criminal laws, by which he ought to be punished. Having got his certificate from one, no indictment will lie in the other. His character he intends to sacrifice, as does a burglar. What he desires is to preserve his gains. He calculates the consequences, and he braves them.

STUDYING THE FEES. In the morning, Tertius Sandies, Esq., and Mr. Sparrow held a consultation about how the opposition to Mr. Mincher should be conducted. \" My brief does not show any legitimate grounds of opposition,\" said the barrister. \"I am of opinion,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \" that there are none. My client feels very strongly on the question, and we must make a bluster to satisfy him. I do not think but Goader has well fortified his case, and I believe nothing will come of the opposition. Mr. Mincher has disposed of all his property to one friend or other. We must try to take the case out of Goader's hands. Here is a list of creditors ; now, if we can delay or prevent their proofs being filed, the promises I have got will be sufficient to carry the choice. Goader has bought Biteum off, and I have conducted my case with secrecy ; indeed, I believe your presence in Court will be the first intimation he will have of the opposition to his choice. I have subp\u0153naed these witnesses against the proof of the Jew. You see, the Jew confessed at the Eagle and Ball that his debt was one thousand pounds ; he is to be allowed to prove for two thou sand pounds. We shall clear him off. This is a Ust of the properties he has disposed of. The accountant tells me there are no entries in his books of the moneys he must have received for these properties.\" \"But,\" said the barrister, \"can we go into that matter at this meeting ?\" \"You are come from London,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \" especially retained in this case.

Noise and bluster, right or wrong, will therefore satisfy him, and justify the bill I shall bring against him. Let me see ; let me see,\" continued he, looking about his desk, then turning round to look at the law books which were arranged upon the shelves behind him : \" Let me see ? where is it. I had it in my hand this morning : what can I have doue with it ? let me see.\" \" What is it ?\" said the barrister. \" A list of the Court fees. Let me see ; where can I have put it now ? Tut, tut, tut ; where can it be? Oh, here it is. I have been looking over these fees. I think we can manage to get this fee, and that, and that ; this there will be some doubt about, but we must work for it.\" \" Did you ever try to get this fee ?\" said the barrister. \" No, never.\" \" We get it in London ; Sudbrook pointed out the way.\" \" Indeed, then we will try to get it here ; it will be a wrinkle for the profession, and a welcome addition to our bills. By the way, the Commissioners charge ten pounds upon every docket struck, and twenty pounds upon the choice of assignees.\" \"Yes,\" said the barrister; \"to the secretary of bankrupt's account, out of which their salaries are paid ; and to the compen sation account, ten pounds.\" \"Yes ; do you pay that down iu London, or out of the first moneys ?\" \" The ten pounds are paid down, and the twenty pounds out of the first moneys ; and if there be no money at all, the assignee pays it, and reimburses himself how he can.\" ''The Commissioners here have one pound for every meeting to each Commissioner, and to every adjourned meeting. This is a premium upon adjournments, and where there are a dozen or more adjournments a day it makes a very considerable income. Did you ever hear why the legislature made those fees one pound instead of one guinea ?\" \" From motives of economy,\" said the barrister. \" Ha, ha, ha !\" laughed Mr. Sparrow; \" the other officers of the Court are entitled to fees for every meeting and every adjourned meet ing. In London, now, if there be no funds, do the officers take precedence, or are they paid pro rata ?\" \" The case does not arise. If there be no estate the assignee has to pay the money and reimburse himself by a levy upon the creditors who have proved.\" \" Then you never lose anything in London, neither the Court nor any of its officers ?\" \" Of course not,\" said the barrister. \" If there is no estate we find a fund somewhere.\" Ha,"], [407, "STUDYING THE FEES. 399 ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Sparrow; \"we do that identical same here. The law is very provident ; it takes care of all its children.\" \"Do you know why that is, Mr. Sparrow?\" said the barrister. \"No; why?\" \"Because the law is made by lawyers and for lawyers.\" \" Ha, ha, ha ! that is very clever \u2014 very clever indeed. Then we cannot suppose that, as the profession has so large a share in making the laws, that the profession will not take care of itself. Ha, ha, ha ! Did you ever feel sufficiently curious to make an average of how much of the money which arises from bankrupt estates goes among the creditors, and how much among the profession ?\" \" In London, you mean ?\" \"Yes, in London.\" \" I have not ; but one of my learned brethren has ; he is very curious in such statistics. He has made an average how many spectacles we find in the Court when it is cleaned out, and how many umbrellas, and how many walking-sticks, and how many pocket handkerchiefs. He has endeavoured to ascertain the same facts as they apply to stage coaches, to churches, to theatres, to the Houses of Parliament ; in fact, everywhere where people are in the habit of congregating together. He has dis covered that there is an average of forgetfulness, and that average is the same wherever human beings assemble. Singular, is it not, that even such things follow a determinate law ! It is not that such are left because they are such ; but that that strange thing which we call the mind of man \u2014 that Protean entity, which some metaphysicians say is au everchanging nonentity \u2014 a mode of action, rather than the thing which acts \u2014 a passion of that viscous matter which we call the brain ; \u2014 strange, that this should be everywhere alike \u2014 that the profound logic of the philosopher, the rich and exuberant imagination of the poet, the devotion of the divine, the courage of the hero, the far-reaching penetration of the statesman, the deep observation of the physician, the resignation of the martyr, and the finesse of the lawyer, should all be but a mode of action of matter which chemists have dis covered to be ozmazone, albumen, oleine, cholesterine, phosphorus, salts, acids, sulphur, and water. Strange, that the epic genius of Homer, the sublimity of Milton, the Protean inspiration of Shakespeare, the majestic numbers of Dryden, the rapt sweetness and pathos of Burns, and the vagrant but glorious muse of Byron, should all be but passions of matter ; that the Promethean light"], [408, "400 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. which fired them with genius should be but a mode of action, the highest expression of those laws by which all minds are governed. I sometimes think that the mind of man is something we shall never discover by analysing the dead matter from which the mind has flown, an ethereal something which comes from heaven, and when the body dies goes back home again, a wan- derer for a time, a prodigal son, who, as soon as his sins are corrected and repented of, will go back to his Father ! We shall all go back to our Father, and our Father will come out to meet us, as did the prodigal's father. Excuse me thus wandering, but you touched a theme upon which I sometimes think seriously, and had thoughts, before business so much en- grossed my attention, of investigating to its conclusions. But now I fear the dream is over, and the necessity to live, and the demand my profession makes upon me, will prevent it being other than a dream. Let me see, where were we ? O yes, you want to know what is the average of the moneys realised from bankrupt estates which come to the profession, and how much to the creditors. My friend ascertained that in Loudon it was two-thirds to the profession, and one-third to the creditors; but our Commissioners are about to petition the Chancellor to enlarge the fees, or else the Bankruptcy Court will become bank- rupt, and that would be a strange phenomenon indeed. To think that we lawyers were not able to take care of ourselves !\" \" Ha, ha, ha !\" laughed Mr. Sparrow, \" it would indeed. I should think the day of judgment was come then, and the reign of the saints had begun \u2014 a time, I hope, a long way off; for when there are no rogues I do not know what we shall do. When there is no roguery or misguided passion we shall have to attack honest men without those excuses. We must live, you know ; all the world must live; the world would think Arcadian days were returned if we lawyers became bankrupt.\" \" Ah !\" said the barrister, with a humorous sigh, \"that will never be until the devil is dead, and some of the most learned divines say he is an immortality, whose chief work will begin when the days of men are over.\" \"Ha ! ha! ha! that is very good, very good indeed; you are facetious this morning. Now, to this list of fees ; let us see, are there any more we can get ? We can get these, I am sure, and those, but can we get the others ?\" \" What sort of Commissioners are"], [409, "401 STUDYING THE FEES. yours; are they martinets?\" \"0 no, they are easy fellows; they let us have as many meetings as we like ; they help us and help themselves at the same time, and serve all the officers of the Court. If the law were not so strict on such matters we should readily subscribe them a very handsome testimonial. You may think what a happy family we are, the most unscrupulous among us never, never quarrel with the Court. It lets us make all the fees we cau ; we have one of the Christian virtues, if no more ; we dwell together in harmony, each serving the other to the best of his ability.\" \" As it- should be, \" said the barrister. \" I do dislike to see the Court and Bar at variance; their interests are in common, why then should a squeamish love of justice on the part of the Court stand in the way of the emoluments of the profession ? Why should the Commissioners, who have risen to the upper places in the law, look down with stern justice upon the mob of us, for we are numerous enough to be called a mob, and keep us all in poverty for the advantage of the public, who care not a wit for any of us ; indeed, some of them express a desire that we were all consigned to an ardent place where that great palladium of liberty, the trial by Jury, is unknown ; a place where the glorious writ of Habeas Corpus will not run \u2014 an absolute monarchy, where the High Sheriff is king, and with un- relenting severity does execution upon all his subjects.\" \" Ha ! ha ! ha ! very good, very good indeed ; but you must mind the proprieties of society, and not say that in any company. Beware of the exoteric and the esoteric ; the esoteric should not be di- vulged, not even in all learned societies ; and for the public, the public, my good Sir, should be dosed with nothing but the exoteric \u2014 a long face and a solemn visage is alone suitable to such subjects. For my part I am of opinion that all professions pay too little respect to the esoteric. What would the people think of our profession, now, if they were to be informed that the ob ject and end of all our labours was the making of fees ; that you and I, for instance, were now studying this list of fees for the express intention of making all of them we can; that the love of right we exoterically profess is but the matadore flag, under cover of which we attack the fortunes of men ? Do you think they would allow us to enter the arena ? No ; unless they were so blinded by passion that they could see nothing but the excitement"], [410, "402 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. of the combat.\" \" And what is there in our profession at all worthy of censure,\" said the barrister, \" if really and truly fees are the object of our pursuit ? It is the same with the trades man ; the loom is not worked with the benevolent object of clothing the naked or decorating the vain with its beautiful and matchless labrics. The mine is not pierced with the charitable intention of warming the perishing, adding to the comfort of man, or restoring the fertilising principles to the atmosphere, which the physical revolutions of past ages have buried deep in the earth. The mariner doth not tempt the dangers of the seas to bring from foreign climes their produce, which add so materially to the comfort and luxury of this, merely because he is in love with his kind. Our church dignitaries do not preside over the souls of men for the laudable purpose of peopling heaven. Gain is the object of all. Why, therefore, should there be any surprise expressed that we of the law study the list of fees, and try in every case to make as many of them as we cau ? It is our duty to ourselves and our families to increase our incomes; it is our duty to each other to establish as many ways as we can to com mand a large share of the world's goods : let the opposite parties to the suit make out their case to the best of their ability ; let it be ours to gain the verdict for ourselves. Why should we suffer in reputation, when we take every possible means to increase our incomes ?\" \"A very wise and correct statement of the case,\" said Mr. Sparrow. \"Did this observation ever occur to you,\" said the barrister, \" that the gains of our profession are made in the preliminaries, and the more we can multiply them the greater they are ? If we took the case to the Court directly for a decision, why as soon as the decision was given there would be the end.\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \"we could open the case again upon misdirection \u2014 tbe suppression of evidence \u2014 the ruling of the Judge \u2014 verdict being against the evidence. We can always find a way of continuing the suit so long as our clients will afford the means of procedure.\" \" You say truly. We can do so when we meet with a stupid man who will not accept defeat, or a wealthy man whose pride is so great that he will not believe the poorer man is right, and who means by his wealth to procure the object which he calls upon the law to award him. But these are the exceptions. Our gains are best"], [411, "403 STUDYING THE FEES. made by delaying the decision \u2014 by making as many preliminary moves as possible ; by disputing about the mode of procedure ; by arguing that this form should have been filled, and that step should have been taken ; by making the learning of the law stand in the way of its justice, and so effectually that justice is not called upon to speak, but making the learning by which we are enabled to overpower her voice take the place of her behests. The temptation to get fees has already made the approaches to justice of so labyrinthic a character that the case is oftener won in the labyrinths with which learning has surrounded the Court of Justice than in the Court in which she sits. She may sit there and see her suitors bewildered in the maze, and regret that they cannot enter the temple because they will not keep to the right. But what is the use of her regTets, when we know that her decisions would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs ? It will be a long time before the learned profession gives up this learning. Where there is wealth we can make intricacies ; and as the public are beginning to see that cases are won by subtleties and not by right, they will invoke those subtleties, and the acute man will win by these legal robberies, and will not think of taking an honest course to gain his cause. But you and I are in the pro fession ; we have to live by it ; and we must not be squeamish about the rogueries and follies, or the misfortunes of men. They are the mines in which we work, and be it our object to follow up the golden vein as long as the lode is worth working. Leave the correction of these things to pattern men \u2014 to soft-hearted reformers \u2014 to those who would rather have the goodwill of man kind than their wealth. Let such men contend that posterity may erect to them a statue in the market-place \u2014 a piece of marble carved into their shape \u2014 a flattering tribute to their worth \u2014 when no flattery can cheer ' the dull cold ear of death.' But let us contend for wealth, that we may leave our sons ' a county for an estate.' \""], [412, "404 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LVI. ILLNESS. I was subp\u0153naed to give evidence before the Commissioners. At the time I did not know upon what, but I afterwards learned it was upon Mr. Levy's claim, and upon the removals I witnessed at Mr. Mincher's house. Old Joe was also summoned to attend ; but poor old man, he was suddenly laid upon a sick bed. I have said that Old Joe had become a favourite ; as soon, therefore, as I heard of his illness, I paid him a visit. There the old man lay upon his truckle bed, his body enfeebled, but his mind unclouded. There was a patchwork coverlet upon his bed, worked into small stars, surrounding a larger one ; the curtains to his room window were chintz, as were the covers to the chairs ; the room had a comfortable, a womanly comfortable appearance. Upon the table was a large pincushion ; I was surprised to see the device upon it ; the pins, which made the device, were black with age, except the heads of them, which were kept very bright. I tried to extract one of them, but it had so rusted in the cushion that it seemed as if I should tear it before I could pull one out. It was a relic of years gone by, when another beside old Joe was the occupant of that chamber \u2014 it was a woman's cushion, but it was clean, and the heads of the pins were bright. His daughter afterwards told me that Old Joe would not allow any one to touch that cushion but himself, and she said that he would sometimes sit for an hour together rubbing the heads of the pins with the sleeve of his coat, and during the whole time he would not speak, but a tear would sometimes roll down his cheeks and fall upon it ; he would then put the cushion upon the table, turn his face to the wall, and hum a tune of other days, the one he had used to sing a long time ago, when he went a courting. But the poor old man"], [413, "405 ILLNESS. could not make much of the song, for tears rolled down his cheeks, and made his voice so husky that he could not make a song of it at all. The old man would wipe away his tears and say, \" Ah, poor wench, you were a good wife to me.\" That cushion brought back a rush of memories to the old man, and unmanned \u2014 nay, did not unman him, but made him feel as a man ought to feel who has lost his mate \u2014 his own bosom dear \u2014 who was to him the greatest of God's blessings. Some would call him a tender-hearted simpleton ; but they should have his intensity of feelings, and lose a partner as dear to them as she was to him, before they sit in judgment. He would say, \" He did not rail at God's decrees ; but she was very dear to him, and it almost broke his heart when it pleased God to take her from him.\" A stranger would not know of this intensity of feeling, and it required the close observation of a familiar friend to discover it. The links which bound him to his wife's memory must be touched ; then, like the zephyr's breath, which breathes upon the \u00c6olian harp and stirs the moanings of its melancholy cadences, that sweet sorrow would be moved with which heaven has blest the tender-hearted ; which breathes so sweetly in the poet's song, and gives to the words of the orator the power to entrance the minds of men, and was a prominent character in old Joe's mind. Had art done for him as much as nature had, he would have left a reputation the world would have cherished. It was not because it was a pincushion that the old man had used to sit over it and weep, but because it revived many memories that once were joys to him ; because he had associations with it which stirred his deep feelings ; it was the work of his old wench ; she had formed the device upon it when she expected that God would make her & mother, and He did bless her and him with a man child. When he saw it, his imagination revived the days of \" Auld Lang Syne,\" with all their loves, their affections, and their joys. They would pass before him like the magic scenes of a dream, when the deeds of a life-time are re-enacted with the reality of life, and during the few moments the vision lasts, the treasures of the store-house of the mind are disclosed, like the scenes of the theatre, which have at some time or other assisted to portray the story of love, of trial, of sorrow, or of victory. They may be retired from view, but when slid into memory's groove, we live in the past again."], [414, "406 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN The poor old man lay in his bed quite ill, his head lay back, his chin was a little elevated, his arm lay on the outside of the bed, and his fingers were picking listlessly at the coverlet. As I looked at him I saw the under side of his chin and up his nostrils, which I thought were pinched ; his features had altogether a sharper appearance than I had before observed ; the skin of his neck, from beneath which the muscles had sadly fallen away, was stretched in two gussets between which the throat \u2014 fully configured \u2014 stood out promi nently ; his beard had grown into a stiff stubble. I walked very noiselessly up to his bed ; he turned his head with a gentle roll, and, holding out his hand, said, \" Master John, I am glad to see you.\" He held out his hand for me to shake. As I held his he grasped mine firmly and shook it with short, firm, and con vulsive shakes ; his hand was hot and dry, his fingers were long, and the joints stood out like bony lumps ; the anatomy of his hand was very plainly seen. \" Master John, I am glad to see you,\" said he. \"Joe,\" said I, \" I am sorry to see you so ill.\" \" The Lord's will be done, Master John.\" I thought it my duty to listen to the poor old man, for ill as he was, his mind might not be able to follow mine, or to have its current disturbed by any objections or reflections I might make. I thought a silent acquiescence in his thoughts would be of the greatest comfort to him. I did not know but the illness which had struck him, had struck him for death, and then where would be the use of troubling the poor old man with arguments, even though they might be the most profound and irresistible, to prove to him how erroneous his opinions were. None could find fault with his course of life. I hate the over zealous man who can stand by the bed of death and hold a theological discussion upon speculative opinions, or trouble the flight of a departing soul with threats and prophecies about futurity of which, heaven knows, the most farseeing of our race are so badly informed, and the most ignorant are so positive. If your convictions and what you think your duty will not permit you to let the spirit depart in comfort, stand aside, seek another sphere of duty, and do not, I beseech you, add to the travail and sorrow of death. When the axe is laid to the root, and the tree is cut down, it is too late to prate about how it might have been better grown. If"], [415, "ILLNESS. 407 you wish to receive the tribute your vanity demands, by all means deliver your disquisitions before another audience, and there will be no one so ready to applaud as I. I will do it until the applause is re-echoed if that will please you. But, by the bed of death be peaceful and calm. Leave the disputes of the schools and of the world on tbe outside of the house. Let the spirit go in peace into the presence of its Maker. If it be to be punished, let Him punish. If it be to be rewarded let Him reward. Do not you meddle with our Father's prerogatives. \" Master John, my life has been a happy one ;\" this he said very slowly and deliberately \u2014 there was none of that affectation of manner which is some times seen and heard from a sick bed ; but his words were uttered as distinctly and cheerfully as his feeble state would permit \u2014 there was no whining or selfish impatience \u2014 \"and if this illness has come to summon me home, as I think it has, I feel that I cannot regret that I have been permitted to enter this beautiful temple of God, to know the joy of existence, Master John, and to feel what He has done for me and all His creatures.\" As the old man said so he moved his hands \u2014 had he been stronger he would have moved his arms to assist his idea of expansion, and lifted up his eyes as if he were looking at the firmament of heaven. \" Yes, Master John, what He has done for all of us, though we are so thoughtless and do not observe His bounty, yet He doth not lack in bounty on that account. Master John, you have seen a mother, a fond mother, tend and care for her little child, feed it and nourish it, and comfort it, and take it in her arms, and hush its little sorrows until it sobbed itself to sleep, and then watch over it with the tenderest care ; providing it food and clothing, attending to all its wants, and gathering up its little playthings that when it wakes it may be amused again ; Master John, we are but children, and God does the same, aud more, for us. He provides us food, and covers the land with plenty. He gives colour to the landscape, decorates the meads with flowers, fills the hedge-rows with blossoms. They are His pennants, Master John, and our toys ; the signs of love among the plants, and of His goodness and tenderness, Master John ; their forms need not have been beautiful, nor their colours gay; and, Master John, our eyes might have been so made as not to see them in their beauty ; and our ears, like those of the brutes,"], [416, "408 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. might not have heard musical sounds, or the song of the little birds. But, He is kind, Master John ; He provides for our wants and our comforts, and He scatters beauty around us as tenderly as the mother who is so fond of her child does round her baby. Master John, we are too much like the little child \u2014 we are wayward, Master John, we cry and groan about trifles, and will not listen to that fond voice, and follow its lessons, and we sometimes fly in its face ; but, Master John, He loves us like a mother. If her child rebels, she takes him to her heart again. Yes, Master John, he may break her heart ; but even though her hopes are broken and ruined, she never forgets her child. How many poor mothers' hearts are broken, Master John, and covered by that green turf which I feel will soon cover me. But, Master John, if the little rebel returns to his poor broken-hearted mother, while she is in the flesh, she forgives him before she is asked, and she cries with joy, Master John, that her son is no longer a sinner. She believes his first repentant word, and thinks him as pure as though he had never committed sin. Master John, young men like you do not know or feel this ; you think it the cant of an old man ; but, Master John, when you have lived in the world as long as I have, you will know that an old man's cant is God's truth. Master John, it is natural for a youth to be confident, and to think he knows more than age, and I think it is right, Master John. The world is all before him. Did he know its sorrows and struggles he would be daunted : his heart would fail. But with the confidence of inexperience he braves it all. He does not see the rocks a-head, and he runs his bark all too soon among the breakers. Master John, I am an old man, and can speak with an old man's experience. I do not repine that I cannot see into the future. No, Master John. If it had pleased our Father to have given me the power to see what would have happened in the future, the power which he gave to those prophets in the olden times, when He came down to talk to man face to face, as we read, Master John, in the good old book.\" The old man here interrupted the current of his thoughts. He grasped my hand firmly, and looked at me as seriously as if he were delivering to me his dying testament ; every word was distinct, and delivered with a firm sincerity. \" Master John, I hope you cherish and reverence that good old book. I know there are"], [417, "ILLNESS. 409 some who call it a bundle of old wives' fables ; but, Master John, it has done more good in the world, and will do more good in the world, if it be a bundle of old wives' fables, than all the generations of those scoffers who ever lived, now live, or shall live hereafter, are likely to do, if they live in the world until they are old as Methuselah. When, Master John, we are young, in health, and full of the pasture, we are heedless, and scoff at all things ; but, Master John, when we are laid upon a sick bed, as I am, there is not one but runs to that good old book, as in panic, Master John, for aid and comfort. Cherish it, Master John ; it is a good old book. Then you will be no more afraid of meeting death than you will be of meeting a friend. It is only he whose conscience strikes him, who is panic stricken, and with fear runs to that good old book and the priest, as if they could save him from the punish ment he feels that he deserves. No, Master John; cherish it. Then when death comes to you, as he is coming to me, you will meet him as a friend. Cherish it, Master John; even though it be for no other purpose than a selfish one, as some of these scoffers say, for your life will be happy in this world, and you may face here after without a fear, even though it be that when you leave this beautiful temple, this glorious earth, that light which blesses man by day, that moon which sails through the blue sky with such unmatched beauty, like a queen in God's temple, and those ever blessed stars, which tell of grandeur and glory far, far away ; so far, Master John, that we cannot conceive how far \u2014 yes, even though it be when you leave this matchless scene of unrivalled grandeur you die for ever, and are gone ; sink into nothingness, and the elements alone, of which you are made, is all that is eternal. But if there be a hereafter, as something within me says there is, a place where the souls of great and good men congregate, who have banished envy, Master John, and have learned humility \u2014 not as we learn it, Master John, who like every one to be humble but ourselves \u2014 we, in pride, preach humility to others, but we are proud enough ourselves; \u2014 a place where our fathers, our friends, our companions, and my poor old wench, bless her, have gone, then that good old book will be our passport to them, and the livery of our souls by which we are put into possession of that eternal inheritance. 0 dear me, where am I ?

My poor old head is not as it used to be ; it roams about things, and I become moithered. Master John, I shall not live long ; I feel I shall not. Ah ! Master John ; I know what you are going to say. It is very kind of you to try to comfort a poor old man like me ; but Master John, I have seen death too often, and I am not afraid of it. I feel that though I have Dot always done as I ought to have done, I have tried, Master John, and always done my best. I know there is a good God. I know His heart is more tender than mine. I know He is a kind Father \u2014 kinder than I am, or any other father. I could not punish a son that I had seen had tried to walk in the right way, as far as his light would lead him. My heart would not let me do it ; and shall God, whose heart is larger and more tender than mine, do it ? No, Master John ; no. And when people say so, do not believe them : they may be sincere in saying so, but God is not made like them. I feel, Master John, that it will not be long before I am in His presence ; and, Master John, give me your hand ; hear what an old man says. Think that I speak as sincerely as if these were the last words I should say before I leave this beautiful world, for a temple more beautiful and everlasting.\" As the old man said this, he looked into my eyes as if he would look into my very soul. His eyes became all pupil, and the iris but a very narrow margin. \" Master John, cherish that good old book ; let it be the guide of your life, and do not listen to the men who say it is a bundle of old wives' fables. O my poor head, Master John ; it is moithered. I had something else to say to you, but it has gone out of my mind. I cannot remember now as I had used to do. I began to tell you, Master John, but I have forgot it. I feel that my memory is going. What was it, Master Johu ? When I was a young man, like you, I could remember anything ; but now, alas ! this poor old machine is worn out, and soon the soul which has been the tenant will quit the tenement for a better world. O dear ! why cannot I remember ? Master John, what was it ?\" \" Never mind now,\" said 1 ; \"do not trouble yourself. I will see you again. You will remember before then, and you can tell me when I see you again.\" \"Master John, I may never see you again in this world.\" \"Do not say so, Joe ; you may, I am sure, get well again.\" \"No, Master John; no. There is that within me"], [419, "ILLNESS 411 which says, No. I am summoned by my Maker, and I must obey the summons.\" As he said this there was a calm serenity in his manner, a placid resignation which to me was wonderful. I felt at fault how to make a proper reply. I therefore stood in silence by the old man's bedside. I thought perhaps the old man had said more than the enfeebled state of his mind was capable of, and that quietness and rest were essential to his recovery. I therefore took the first opportunity I could to leave him without being abrupt. When I was leaving him he caught hold of my hand again, and said, \" Farewell, Master John ; farewell. Lead such a life that we may meet again in heaven.\" \" But, Joe,\" said I, \" I hope to see you again on earth.\" \" Well, well,\" said he, and turned his face to the wall, \" if you do, I shall be very glad to see you ; but if I should be gone to heaven, I shall be happier still to welcome the son of my old master there.\" Poor old man ! I am not ashamed to say that, as I left him, the first tears I had ever shed in a sick room I shed there. I never thought the old man had such stuff in him, or that the last illness of a good and thought ful man was so instructive. I felt that it was, in truth, better to go to the house of mourning than to tread the halls where youth and beauty dance to the gay strains of music. I left word with his daughter that if he became worse to send for me immediately. 1 felt that I could not let the old man soar into eternity without again receiving his blessing."], [420, "412 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LVII. ASSEMBLING. I have said that at the time to which these recollections refer there was no established court house in which the meetings in bankruptcy were held, but that whatever attorney took proceed ings, in his office the meetings were held ; at least the first meeting, and if he carried the choice then, as now, the most important proceeding (at least to the attorney \u2014 as it meant a large bill to him) \u2014 all the subsequent proceedings also ; but if he did not carry the choice, then in the office of his more fortunate competitor. There are usually a large number of creditors present when the choice is made, for each attorney who is competing for the job does his best to excite the feelings of the creditors on his own behalf, and, as much as he can, gives his partisans the impression that their interest depends upon his success ; but when the choice is made, the zeal which he had displayed in the interest of all concentrates in the interest of one, which unfortunately is in opposition to those of the creditors. \" Why, Sir, his interest is his business ; it is his trade ; it is the way he gets his living ; and would you have a man sacrifice his living for the benefit of creditors, who care no more for him than he cares for them. No. He should get as much as he can out of them for himself; or he would be no tradesman.\" \"And the poor bankrupt \u2014 what of him ?\" \" O, he need not care ; the property is gone from him. It is not his property ; they fight about it. It is all U P, up, with him, and what need had he to care. The sooner he looks out for another job the better, sorrowing and grieving over the past will not help him on in life. The only thing which is wrong is that the Court does not release him as soon as possible, and let him go into the world to have another"], [421, "413 ASSEMBLING. try to live, and not keep the poor fellow lingering on in mental misery, that the attorneys and the officers of the Court may make money out of the estate. Let him go, and then they may all make as much as they can. What's it matter if the creditors take the estate there, it serves them right ; they have had enough experience that it is of no use to them.\" \"That is a fine doctrine to preach, however. Do you think the Legislature would establish a Court for the purposes you imagine ?\" \" Think, my good man ! There is no thinking about it ; they have done so. I do not mean to say that they did it intentionally, but they have done it, and there it is. The parties concerned are very foolish if they do not get as much as they can out of it. You are no more virtuous than they, for all you make so many professions. If a nice savoury pie were put in your way, you would dip into it like a very gourmand. Come, come, Sir, no professions of virtue. You are a piece of human nature as well as any one else. If you are not a sinner it is because you have not the opportunity, or the passion, to commit sin ; not because you are pure. You have no peccant opportunities, and therefore look on and censure those who have. Come, come, Sir, speak not of the sins of others harshly. Unless you have their passions, their opportunities, have been tempted as they have and have passed the ordeal unscathed ; until then, your words are but ignorant prattle, and let us have none of them.\" \" I take this opportunity of mentioning in this Court,\" said the Chairman, \"what the assignee has privately spoken to me about, that there are a great number of cases, and let me say they are becoming increasingly numerous, in which there is no estate, not even enough to pay the assignee his expenses. It is sufficiently well known that in his expenses are included our fees, and it is preposterous to suppose that we shall sit here adminis tering the law, and not receive the reward, our fees, which the law has provided. Mercy is all well enough, generosity is all well enough, and charity is all well enough in the right place, not here. It is the law we have to administer, and not a maudlin sentimentality. If we administer the law, we must have the law's reward. I shall make order that no discharge shall issue until the bankrupt bas paid the assignee his expenses.\" \"But, your Honour, the bankrupt is stripped of everything ; he has not a"], [422, "414 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. penny in the world; how can he pay the fees?\" \" I have nothing to do with that. The law which provides him with his discharge from all his liabilities is the same law which prescribes our fees. I cannot sit here to administer those laws, and only administer the one side of them. My oath and my conscience will not allow me. The bankrupt has no business to come to this Court until he has provided our fees. There are plenty of ways open to him to do it before he parts with his property, and he must do it,\" \" But your Honour will observe that the bankrupt, if really insolvent \u2014 and if there be no estate, he must be insolvent indeed \u2014 has no property. To save to himself any of that which may happen to be in his possession, is morally and legally dishonest ; if he do so the penal clauses of the law will reach him.\" \" We all know very well what that means ; we did not come into the world yesterday. I mention thus publicly the order I make, that all applicants to this Court may know what is expected of them, and they must make provision accordingly: no discharge will henceforth issue until the assignee's expenses are paid.\" \"But, your Honour, suppose the bankrupt make to himself a private purse, out of which lo pay these expenses, will your Honour punish him for it ? \" \"I shall suppose nothing. Every case will be taken upon its own merits. The Court makes the order, and will enter into no arguments. The assignee's expenses must be paid.\" There is no doubt but that it was the intention of the Legislature that there should be no fees practically receivable when there was no estate. They reasoned, and very correctly, that to waste the property of the creditors in protracted and useless law proceedings was an abuse, and therefore, by removing the temptation, would remove the abuse. There is no abuse that ever existed but some one looks at it in a point of view in which it looks like right. Bemove the abuse, and they who have heretofore fattened upon it straightway become noisy with the language of injured innocence. There are always enough ears in the world upon which that language will fall, so as to make the tongue wag and the pen move in virtuous indignation. As Mr. Goader had commenced the proceedings in bankruptcy against Mr. Mincher, the first meeting was held in his office. The Commissioners knew the ins and outs of that office, and"], [423, "ASSEMBLING. 415 therefore as they arrived, entered by the back way. The office was a little altered in the arrangement. The desk at which Mr. Goader sat was removed, and tables sufficiently long were arranged in its place, at which the Commissioners sat. The tables were flanked at each end by a return, at which the attorneys and their clerks could sit. Several inkpots and quill pens were scattered about the tables, as also several sheets of foolscap, and many legal-looking bundles of papers tied up with red tape. As the Commissioners arrived, Mr. Goader was all blandness and smiles, paying them the greatest deference and attention. He knew of how much importance in legal matters a \" consideration\" is ; therefore, whenever he expected to obtain anything, he always paraded the consideration. Now, as he wished the Commissioners to decide in his favour, flattery was the consideration he was prepared to offer, and that to any amount. Therefore, as the Commissioners entered he was all obsequiousness, laughed heartily at their wit, and was exceedingly solemn at their wisdom. They had a \" hereditary\" manner ; their deportment was the same as the Lord Chancellor's, before he entered upon business ; they made palronising remarks, held their hands behind them as they stood with their backs to the fire, were very solemn, had frowns of wisdom upon their brows, held their heads on one side, and looked upwards as a goose does when anything unusual flies across the sky ; and surely that is wise, and calculated to give an impression of great sagacity. I have no doubt that though you may not have been favoured with the sight of a Lord Chancellor in private, you have seen many a person as self-satisfied with themselves \u2014 have as many airs as he has \u2014 I beg pardon \u2014 as many external indica tions of wisdom as he has \u2014 but, alas, for the wisdom ! it never abode in those sagacious-looking noddles. If you have not had this pleasure, go and look at the Town Council when there is a Government Inspector among them, sitting beside the Mayor. Then you must be a very bad observer indeed, if you do not see enough of it to last you tbe remainder of your life. As the Commissioners moved from one part of the office to another \u2014 I mean when the people were in \u2014 some invisible person shouted in a loud authoritative voice, \" Make way there ! make way there !\" The first time I heard these commanding orders I was"], [424, "416 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. frightened, and ran back. I thought a great lumbering wagon was coming, or stage coach, or some other heavy vehicle, out of whose way it was necessary to be quick, if I were not prepared to go to \" kingdom come\" all in a hurry. But after bearing the shout a time or two, I said, \" Confound that fellow, what does he make that noise for ? they are big enough to make way for themselves.\" \" But, then, you see, the dignity of the law which was represented in their persons!\" \"0, ay, to be sure; the dignity of the law; nay, not the dignity merely, but the majesty of the law !\" Before that I bowed as low as an Eastern slave, and in my ignorance, as soon as I heard the shout \" Make way there ! make way there !\" I doffed my hat, and bowed to any- thing which was in motion, for I thought that the majesty of the law. I was very inexperienced then, for on one occasion I bowed to the Town Crier ; I mistook his cock and pinched hat and gold lace for the majesty of the law, when it was only the majesty of the Corporation. But we are all ignorant at some time of our lives, and ought to be foigiven when we commit these kind of errors. About the office were placed all the chairs the establishment could boast, and four or five forms, which looked as if they had been borrowed for the occasion from the neighbouring Sunday schools. Though the accommodation prepared was great, yet, when the creditors entered, it was insufficient. The Commissioners, with Mr. Goader's assistance, looked over the papers and other documents relating to the case. \" Goader,\" said one of them, dropping the Mr. \u2014 he was too dignified for that piece of respect \u2014 \" Goader, these fees are all paid, are they ?\" \" They are, your Honours,\" said Mr. Goader, with great respect. \" Well\" said he, and all five of them took a pen in hand, and scratched their chins, looking up with wise expectation. Now, Mr. Goader knew that \" well\" was. Norman French, or some other language current in the profession, for \" Let these creditor fellows in.\" He therefore gave the signal to the young man who had to let in the rush of victims by the announcement, \"Walk in; the Court is sitting.\" While the Commissioners were assembling in the inner office, the creditors were assembling in the outer or clerks' office. The first to arrive sat himself down upon one of the office forms, and looked at the fire very seriously. He would now and then heave"], [425, "417 ASSEMBLING. a deep sigh. He seemed like a tradesman struggling with difficulties, and this loss had come to add to those which were already almost too much for him. He entered the office with a gentle, stealthy tread, as if he were afraid of his own footfall, and sat very quietly upon the form. He seemed as if he were running his troubles over in his own mind, and as each new one in the dark series arose before him he greeted it with a sigh. He looked round the office, and then again steadfastly at the fire. He put his hat on the floor, then picked it up, turned it over, then swung it between his knees, then put it down again, and heaved another sigh ; then, fidget-like, he took it up again, brushed it round with his handkerchief, then replaced it upon the floor. He could not rest ; he could not follow any one train of thought ; he was fidgety and uneasy. He arose, aud walked, or rather crept, very gently and very noiselessly up to Mr. Twittles, and said, \" If you please, Sir, can you tell me how much there will be in the pound?\" Mr. Twittles said very kindly, \" I cannot.\" Poor fellow, he wanted to realise in his own mind what would be his loss, so that he might do battle with that, and not with the phantom his imagination had raised. How often is it that when trouble is upon us we let our fancies run riot among expectancies which will not, and do not ever happen ; and evils, our fears depict, produce a depression we cannot remove. It was said of old that ghosts haunted the guilty like a shadow. In tbe day, in the darkness, in the dewy eve, or the rosy morn, in crowds or iu solitude, amid the rustic dance upon the village green, in the bend of tbe lane, and by the church wall, his eye could see a shape wbich the innocent could not, and his mind was shaken with fears which the innocent could not comprehend. His guilt might be known only to him self and God, who knows all guilt. Yet that ever restless ghost, which was God's avenger, punished him worse than tbe world would have done, had it known his wickedness, fc-o the poor tradesman who has been guilty of no moral crime, but is merely unsuccessful, carries about with him a secret which harries him as much as any ghost can do. M ight gives no rest ; he lies upon his pillow but to toss about ia misery. He meets the day but as a renewal of his apprehensions. Every rough-looking fellow he thinks an officer, and every creditor who calls he thinks o"], [426, "418 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. has called to crush him. No wonder that such men, when ruin has done its worst, have a delighted countenance and a jaunty step. The ghost which haunted them is then exorcised and gone. There was philosophy in the belief in ghosts, as the old world held that faith, and neither the fathers of the village nor our fathers of the olden time were so simple as the super cilious and the thoughtless say they were. To understand them we must think as they thought, and with a teachable spirit examine their creed. If we do not, we, as it were, throw away a sense. We are not as they, and no wonder, therefore, that to their faith we are infidels. The mole may say there is no sun, and not tell a falsehood, for he hath not the organs to perceive its existence. The owl may say tbe sun is an evil, yet not forfeit his character as Minerva's bird, for he cannot withstand its glare. The traveller, when sinking in the desert, may say the sun is a curse, for it dries up the water for which he is dying, and makes the face of uature arid. There is no truth true if we make none but a partial examination. If we will not take to that examina tion the whole of our senses, or if nature shall have dimmed \u2014 as in the case of the mole and tbe owl \u2014 the sense which is necessary to perceive the truth when it is presented to us. The other creditors rapidly followed each other. Some of them treated the matter lightly, and were inclined to make a joke of it ; yet a keen observer of human nature could see there was a bitterness under that jocularity which wanted but the oppor tunity to shed its gall. Some treated it with as much sadness as did the first arrival. A few, a very few, met it with common sense, as a calamity to which all in trade are liable \u2014 a disease never cured ; and when a monetary disturbance takes place like the one through which they were passing, taking the character of an epidemic, from whose virus none are free. When the wire drawer arrived, he looked about him with confident excitement, as if he expected them to break forth in a spontaneous expression of applause. He was accompanied by two others, who had attached themselves to him, as they would to any one whom they expected to be the hero of the hour ; they were samples of a class who wander about anywhere where there is popularity ; will bang on to any man's chariot who is attracting the admiration of bis fellows. ' ' Well, Sir, you do not blame them ?\" \" Blame them !"], [427, "419 ASSEMBLING. No. It is the nature of them. I may as well blame the toad because his skin is ruckled and revolting ; the newt, because of his disgusting form ; the slimy snail, because he is slimy ; or the sea devil, because he hath not the beauty of Venus when she arose from ocean's bed to enthral mankind in her bewitching lures. Whatever is the nature of a being, I submit that nature was given it by a Power too omnipotent for me to control, and I bow in submission to its superior wisdom.\" As soon as the wire drawer entered, he said, \" Has my counsellor come?\" At this question Mr. Twittles and his fellow clerk lifted up their heads ; that was something spicy, something to observe, and they neglected their work to listen to the conversation of the creditors. As he asked the question he looked around to all of them for a reply ; receiving none, he turned to Mr. Twittles and said, \"Has my counsellor come?\" Mr. Twittles replied, \"Do you expect a counsellor?\" \"To be sure I do ; I have brought one down from London, especially \u2014 the best I can get. I have spared no expense. I will let him know cheating me. There is. law in the land, and I will have it. I am not going to let any one have their own way in the matter. There wants more of it \u2014 there wants more looking into things \u2014 there wants justice. I say there wants justice in the land. Think of a fellow keeping his carriage becoming a bankrupt. I suppose he wants to make a fortune out of us, but I will let him know cheating me. Neither him nor his lawyer are going to have their own way, nor all the lawyers together. I have got my barrister here and I will soon put them straight. There wants more of my spirit ; some folks are afraid to speak out, but I am not. I will let them see I am no pigeon-livered fellow. I will stand up before the boldest of them, and say, ' Who's afraid ?' Not me ! What's a lawyer but a lawyer? I don't care for a thousand of them. Turn me out, will they ? let them try it on now. I have got somebody who will soon put that humour out of them. Turn me out, eh? let them turrr me out now, that's all ! I will have the law upon them. I will let them know. If there is law in the land, and money will buy it, I will have it. I should like to see anybody turn me out now.\" As he said so he clutched a thick walking stick by the middle, and made gestures witb it which said plain enough, \" My barrister will put the lawyers straight, and this"], [428, "420 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. stick shall put anybody straight who attempts to touch me.\" \"His disorder is in the inflammatory stage,\" said Mr. Twittles to his fellow clerk; \" wait until depletion has exhausted the fever, he will be calm enough then.\" Just at this time the young man who had to make the announcement, \" The Court is sitting, walk in,\" opened the door of the inner office, looked at the creditors, then nearly closed the door again, as if to receive some final orders from the Commissioners; but this little diversion had the effect of restoring silence and of diverting the faces of all the creditors to that door ; expectation was there, and it was so far about to be gratified. The instant the door was opened the wire drawer and his companions seemed alarmed ; the Court was about to open, and \" my lawyer and my counsellor\" were not come. \"Fetch them, fetch them,\" said the wire drawer. One of his followers went, all of a run, to fetch them ; but he had not gone far before he met them \u2014 Mr. Sparrow with books and papers under his arm, the barrister, all robed and bewigged, sailing along the street with one of Mr. Sparrow's clerks by his side, carrying his blue bag. All three of them were escorted to the office by a squadron of dirty little boys, and sundry members of the mobocracy, who are always ready to see what is going to happen. \" Who are they ?\" said one to the other in a whisper. \" One on urn's a lawyer, the t'other's a counsellor.\" \" Which is the counsellor?\" \"Ah, you fool, don't you see it's 'im in petti coats ? You can all'ays tell a lawyer from a counsellor, you fool. A counsellor's in petticoats and a lawyer's in breeches, that's it. I thought yow'd got more sense. The one's a man, the t'other's a will-gill \u2014 neither man nor woman.\""], [429, "THE PROOF. 421 CHAPTER LVIII. THE PROOF. \" The Court is sitting ; walk in.\" As soon as this announcement was made, the creditors made a rush to enter, and the young man who seemed to be the crier of the Court shouted, \" Hats off ! Silence!\" And he repeated many times, \" Hats off ! Silence!\" Hang that fellow, thought I, does he think us all deaf? Let him stop until we have taken our seats, and then we shall be silent. But he kept shouting \"Hats off! Silence!\" Now the jocular gentlemen were the first to enter, and although the wire drawer was so brave, or at least so bragging, he let nearly the whole of the creditors enter before he put in an appearance. Ah, thought I, you are not so brave as you seem. The instant the announcement was made, \" The Court is sitting, walk in,\" the Commissioners commenced writing away as fast as they could, making a great scribbling noise with their pens, and pass ing documents from one to the other, as if they had business of the highest importance to transact. \" Who proves the notice ?\" said the one in the centre, who appeared to act as chairman for the others. Here Mr. Goader stepped forward, and one of the officers administered to him an oath, all in one tone, and without any stops or commas from the beginning to the end. This man had no qualms of conscience about swearing or hearing others swear, for he was very anxious to administer oaths, and very careless as to whom he administered them. He seemed to think the more the merrier, for at every one of them he was better pleased. \" Well,\" said I, \"you do do that sleek.\" \" A fee, my boy, for every one,\" said he. \" Oh,\" said I, \" that's it, is it?\" That just explains it, thought I. When I was called upon to take an oath before the clergyman of the parish"], [430, "422 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. about a will, he was offended with the lawyer who took me be cause he did not bring more before him to take oaths. Oh, thought I, how wicked that is; it is this man's duty to teach tbe people tbe Scriptures, and they say \" Swear not at all,\" and he is offended because they do not come before him to swear. I sup pose he wants them to curse as well, the wicked man; but this explains it all: \"A fee, my boy, for every one.\" He does not care who swears, nor how incompatible swearing may be with his holy office. \" It's a fee, my boy, for every one.\" Cursing would be encouraged at the same price. The man who had adminis tered the oath said, \"You swear this is the London Gazette?\" \" I do.\" \" Look it over, and say is there a notice of thi3 meet ing?\" \"There is.\" \" Where is it ?\" \" Here it is.\" \"You swear that is the notice?\" \"I do.\" Now I thought this all very foolish; there was the Gazette, the Commissioners could see it, and could read it. It was before them, a tangible thing, yet they required somebody to swear it was a Gazette, and to swear that there was a notice in it of that meeting. Any one could see it without a learned and expensive educatioir, but these learned men could not. \" A fee, my boy, for every one,\" was a sufficient answer why they were so blind. I soon found that it was not the truth they or the attorneys engaged were in search of; but one side wanted to get all the facts, fictions, and theories, or fictions upon which to ground theories, it could upon their notes, which they called evidence, and the other side to prevent either facts or fictions being entered upon the notes. Facts which good common sense would have decided in a minute were argued about for an hour, to tbe mere bewilder ment of aU who heard the arguments, and to the elucidation of nothing. Each side had formed a theory, and they wished to strike out all which did not suit the theory they had formed. Truth was not their object, but their object was to establish a theory which would suit the end each had in view. I very soon was morally aud positively certain that the truth was excluded, and many fancies admitted as evidence. After this, much mere formal matter was transacted, which the initiated might under stand, but to me it was tedious dumb show. At length the Jew was called upon to prove his debt. The oath was about to be administered to him, but when the four Gospels were presented"], [431, "423 THE PROOF. to him he shook his head. Oh, thought I, if you are so scrupulous about taking an oath upon the four Gospels, you will perhaps tell the truth. I suppose you have a conscience ; but if any one had told me so I would not have believed them. It is only a pretence to persuade the Court that you are bound by an oath, taken according to your own usage, a blind rather than a binding form. I had taken a dislike to the Jew, and therefore was suspicious of all his actions. I had seen several phases of his character, and thought I understood him. After he had been sworn in the manner of the Jews, \" This is a statement of your account against this estate ?\" said Mr. Goader. \" It is,\" said the Jew, \" only I have not claimed interest, which I claim now.\" \" He claims interest, does he?\" said the chairman of the Com missioners, and he wrote that down. \"At what rate?\" said another of them. \"At five per cent.,\" said he. \" All that the law will allow bim,\" said the wire drawer. \" Silence !\" shouted the crier, and the Commissioners held up their hands and looked sternly at the interruption. \" Allow me to look at the claim,\" said Tertius Sandies, Esq. \" This you swear to be a true claim do you ?\" \" I do.\" \" Now, just answer me, if you please ; you need not be so frightened, I am not going to eat you. Speak up. What do you say ?\" \" I do.\" \" Why do you speak so low? you can speak loud enough. What do you say ?\" \" Yes.\" \" Yes, then speak up. You swear that this is a true account ?\" \"les.\" \" Yes ; was this all money that you advanced him ?\" \" It says on the account.\" \" Let me have no shuffling, Sir. Answer the question, Sir ; I am not going to be trifled with, Sir. There is such a thing as perjury, Sir ; and there is such a thing as a pillory, Sir, and if you do not mind what you are about you may find yourself in one, Sir ; and these respectable men who hear me, Sir, may have the pleasure of saluting you there, Sir. Now, Sir, answer, was this all money ; cash, bard cash ; come, Sir, was it?\" \"It is on the account.\" Tertius Sandies, Esq., repeated his question again, this time every word distinct and separate, rapping the account he had in his hand at every word. \" Come, Sir, no shuffling; was \u2014 this \u2014 all \u2014 money? was it, now? answer that question.\" \" It is on the accouut,\" said Mr. Levy. At this the councillor caught hold of his gown, threw the tail of it across his left arm, twisted his body, and then shouted until"], [432, "424 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. he made the office ring, \"Answer me, Sir.\" \"It is on the account,\" said the Jew, obviously frightened at his manner. \" On the account,\" said he contemptuously ; \" and so are you on the account. I shall have an answer to my question, if I stand here until the trumpet call shall sound which is to summon you and all your nation to Jerusalem on donkeys.\" At this sally there was a loud laugh, and the crier called \" Silence ! \" and tbe Commis sioner said, \" We cannot permit these unseemly interruptions. We shall not allow this Court to be turned into a bear garden.\" Now, thought I, who is to understand that simile; it has been years, a many years, since there were bear gardens in this land, yet whenever interruptions take place in a Court of Justice, the presiding Judge says, \" I cannot permit my Court to be turned into a bear garden.\" That expression can be but a phrase; it cannot present a correct meaning to the mind who uses it, or the one who hears it, and yet it has been used for generations for the like purpose, showing how much of mere imitation and current phrases make up the wisdom of Courts of Justice, and of other things, also. It is too much the case that people mistake current phrases for irresistible arguments. \" What am I to do?\" said the barrister ; I put to him a simple question, which admits of either 'yes' or 'no' for an answer, and I cannot get tbat answer from him.\" \"Will not the answer he gives you do?\" said the Commissioner. \" No, it will not.\" \"Then you must answer his question.\" \" Mine God,\" said the Jew, \" I have answered his question; it is on the account.\" \"Silence!\" shouted the crier. \" Now,\" said the barrister, \" look at me. Was the two thousand pounds you claim all cash ; or was some of it wine, or some of it pictures ? \" \" It says on the account some of it was cash, some of it was wine, and some of it was pictures.\" \" And why could you not say that before ? \" As soon as this answer was got, the Commissioners began to write very fast, and the barrister looked over at them, and when he judged they had written it down, \"How much of it was cash ? \" \"It says on the account.\" The barrister took him up short, and shouted at him, \"How much of it was cash, Sir?\" The Jew looked at him bewildered. \" Answer my question, Sir ; how much of it was cash, Sir?\" \"Seven hundred and fifty pounds.\" The answer was given in fear ; the Jew was fast losing his self-possession,"], [433, "THE PROOF. 425 the very object the barrister wanted to accomplish. He wanted to get him into a state of mind in which he would make some mistake, or in some way commit himself; then, when he had done so, no correction would be allowed. The torture of the body, as a means of extracting evidence, is now happily unknown to our tribunals; but the torture of the mind still remains, to the disgrace of our Courts, to the discredit of the judge who permits it, and to the shame of the man, whom the world in common parlance calls a \" bullying barrister,\" who uses it. \" There was seven hundred and fifty pounds iu cash ; you swear that, do you ? \" \"I do.\" \" Mind. Sir, you are on your oath. To our laws it matters not that it is taken according to the forms of your nation. If you swear what is not true, it is perjury, Sir ; and perjury can be very severely punished. I repeat my question \u2014 You swear that seven hundred and fifty pounds was in cash? \" I do.\" \" How much was in pictures? Now, these pictures, they were all old masters, and every one genuine ? \" \u25a0 They were.\" \" Was there an anecdote connected with them \u2014 a little history ? You know what I mean. For instance : A first-rate connoisseur was passing by a broker's shop ; he saw this picture, Sir, among the lumber. His practised eye saw it was one of great merit ; he had it cleaned, and, to his joy and delight, he found it a Paul Veronese. Dirty and neglected though it was, it was in beautiful preservation.

Can you tell what money is owing you?\" \"Two thousand pounds.\" \"That is all, is it?\" \"And interest.\" \"The bankrupt owes you that much?\" \"Yes; the bankrupt owes me that much.\" \"But I mean, what money have you owing to you by every person?\" \" You mean all the money is owing by everybody ?\" \"Yes.\" \" Ah, everybody ?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ah, yes, the one very large sum.\" \"How much?\" \"It is one very large sum. I shall not tell you how much.\" \"You will not ?\" \" No, I will not.\" The Commissioner here interfered : \"Is there any use in pursuing this cross-examination?\" \" There is.\" \" As a rule we do not interfere with counsel, and we have no wish to curtail his licence.\" \" I am desirous of testing his memory.\" \" Yes, we see ; but can any good come of it ? He has sworn that seven hundred and fifty pounds were in cash, and seven hundred and fifty pounds in pictures. As there were two parties to the bargain \u2014 the bankrupt and the Jew \u2014 we must conclude it was a fair trading transaction. The bank rupt does not complain; nay, he admits the account to be correct.\" They all looked round the Court as if they were looking for him. \" It is either true, or a conspiracy to defraud \" \" Pardon me, the whole of the evidence should be heard. I submit that opinion is premature.\" \"We did it to save tbe time of the Court.\" \" I take the time of the Court,\" said the barrister, with some pride and indignation, \" as nothing against the interests of my client.

I consider justice paramount to my own convenience, or the con venience of any one.\" \"Hear, hear,\" shouted the creditors. \" Silence!\" bawled the crier. \" Really,\" said the Commissioner, \" these unseemly interruptions cannot be permitted, and if per sisted in we shall adjourn the Court.\" \" He spoke up well,\" was whispered from creditor to creditor. A frown was upon the face of every one, and with a slight jerk of the head, they whispered, \" one of the right sort. Capital, capital. They should have'"], [435, "THE PROOF. 427 more of it.\" \"Let my barrister alone,\" said the wire drawer, \" he will put them straight.\" The counsellor turned his brief over several times, rubbed his chin with his left hand, then caught hold of his gown at the shoulder, aud addressing the Jew, he said, \" Now, Sir, look at me. You say- seven hundred and fifty pounds was in cash, and seven hundred and fifty pounds in pictures ; will you swear those pictures were worth seven hundred and fifty pounds ? \" \" I do.'' \"You do? They cost you that much ? \" \" They were worth that much.\" \" Worth that much ; did they cost you that much ? Come, Sir, 1 must be plain with you ; you make distinctions. Did they cost you that much?'' \"Mo.\" \"What did they cost you?\" \"I get my living by my trade, and I shall not tell what they cost me.\" \" You will not tell what they cost you. Did they cost you fifty pounds ? \" \" It is my trade. I will not tell my profits. He gave me that money; that is enough.\" \"Well, now as to this wine ; five hundred pounds' worth is a large quantity. That is a transaction so large that some of it should live in your memory. What was it, port or sherry ? \" \" It was wine.\" \" Of your own manufacture, I suppose \" At this there was a laugh. \" Now, Sir, you must know that was a large quantity of wine. Was there a permit?'' \"What!\" \" Was there a permit ? \" \"I do not know.\" \" You do not know. Do you meau to say, Sir, in the presence of this honourable Court, that you cheat the excise ; that you do not scruple to rob the government under which you live.\" Upon this Mr. Goader rose and said, \" If ray learned friend is about to bring a charge against my client, which will subject him to penalties, I shall advise my client not to answer the question. He is not here for the purpose of giving evidence against himself.\" \" Oh, Sir, then your client is the Jew who does not scruple to cheat the government under which he lives, then falls back upon the protection our laws give to all criminals. Sir, as an honest man he should be above such tricks ; but he is a Jew, and that accounts for everything.\" \" That accounts for nothing, Sir. Give me leave to say that the Jews have been for ages persecuted and ill-used j have been despised and treated with contumely ; that we are taught to execrate a Jew from our childhood ; made to detest them when we take in out mother's"], [436, "428 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN: milk ; but also give me leave to say that in my dealings with the Jews T have found them honest and honourable, and I am not going to sit here and permit a race of men to be attacked through the person of my client. If the learned gentleman has a charge to bring against my client, let him bring it, and that before the proper tribunal, and not try to get evidence here which he knows he would not be permitted to obtain elsewhere. I advise my client not to answer any questiou about the wine. He swears to the amount, and that I submit is sufficient for this Court. The bankrupt admits the account is correct. What do you want more ? \" \" If my instructions are to be relied upon, I want a great deal more. I will not press him upon that since you shelter yourself under the privilege which the law affords the witness, that he shall not be compelled to say anything which criminates himself. I submit to your honours that this proof should be adjourned until we are enabled to bring the evidence which we are denied.\" \" We do not see that you have at present made out any case for adjournment ; have you any witnesses?\" \"1 have.\" \"Well, produce them.\" \"Perhaps your honour will allow me to proceed a little further in my cross-examination first.\" \" Proceed, proceed ; if you have any thing which is relevant to bring before the Court, we are prepared to hear it.\" Upon this the counsel turned over several leaves of his brief and said, \" You know the Eagle and Ball ? \" \" I do.\" \" It i3 a celebrated inn, I believe, where all the choice spirits of Birmingham are in the habit of assembling?\" \"I hey are very respectable people.\" \" No doubt; I do not question their respectability. I am not one of those who decry inns ; on the contrary, I am of opinion, with that first-rate poet who once lived in this neighbourhood, and with his fine fancy made himself a retreat equal to those Arcadian scenes the ancients were so fond of, that wherever we go we have ' the noblest welcome at an inn.' I have too frequently enjoyed their hospitality to be ungrateful. But you say you know the Eagle and Ball, and go there?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Did you ever say there that your account was only one thousand pounds?\" \" 1 do not remember saying so ; if I did it was not true.\" \" Come, Sir, let me refresh your memory. Do you remember that it was there that you first heard of this bankruptcy, and that,"], [437, "429 THE PROOF. upon hearing of it, you burst out in alarm, and used strong expressions, that he had cheated you out of one thousand pounds ? \" If I did it was not true.\" \" It was not true, eh? \" \" It was not.\" \" Well, before we have done we shall learn otherwise.\" \" Let me explain.\" \" I want no explanations, Sir ; answer my questions, Sir. Did not you on that night order a pint of brandy, Sir, for yourself, and then, when the brandy was in, let the truth out?\" \"I do not remember ; if I was drunk I might say anything.\" \" We cannot suppose,\" said the Court, \" that you can seriously put forth what is said bv a man in wine as evidence.\" \"I am about to bring forward corroborative testimony.\" \" That is,\" said the Court, \" you are about to produce the persons who heard him say this. Anything more?\" \" That is what I was about to do.\" \"Well,\" said the Court, \"we think the proof must be admitted.\" And the proof was admitted, and the Jew proved for two thousand pounds, when it was only one thousand pounds which was owing him."], [438, "430 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LIX. THE REMOVALS. As soon as Mr. Levy's proof was admitted several of the creditors left, with the remark that they had \" had enough of that ; \" but there was a bustle among the attorneys, as if some thing more serious was about to happen. There were seyeral other attorneys, in addition to those who attended the meeting of creditors ; they were there, as they said, to watch the case on behalf of their respective clients. I do not know how others view this \" wafching the case,\" but to me it means one of two things: either that the Commissioners will not honestly do their duty without this watching, or that they are not sufficiently acute for the office they hold, and may easily be imposed upon by men of less reputation, but of greater abilities; or there may be another reason : it may be one of the ways by which an attorney adds to his income. The Court may be honest and acute, and this watching may be a pretence by which fees are made. Be the reason what it might, there were plenty of them there to make this watching most complete. There were several formal proofs made, and it soon became evident that Mr. Goader would carry the choice. Mr. Sparrow therefore retired from the contest. There was then some conversation across the table among the legal gentlemen, and, as if by consent, Tertius Sandies, Esq., rose and said, \" Call the bankrupt.\" He was called. \"You are the bankrupt ? '' \"I am,\" said Mr. Mincher, with more humility than I should have thought he could have been reduced to. \" You have made a full disclosure of your estate ? \" \"I have.\" \" There have been no removals of property by yourself or others ? \" \" None.\" I was then oalled, and sworn. \" You know the bankrupt ? \" \"I do.\""], [439, "431 THE REMOVALS. \"You have had dealings with him?\" \"My father has.\" \"Yes, your father has. You saw the bankrupt removing goods covertly ? \" \" I did.\" \" What goods were they ? \" \" Plate.\" \"Silver plate?\" \"Yes, silver plate.\" \"I object,\" said Mr. Goader. \" Your honcurs will notice that the witness said, ' Plate,' not silver plate, as counsel has suggested.\" \" Well, plate, I have no desire to steal a march upon you. Your honours are aware that plate is either gold, silver, or silver plated ; but it does not signify much whether it be one or the other of them. It is the removal of anything covertly or openly that is the offence. Tell the Court,\" said he to me, \" how this removal took place.\" I told the Court, \" I was returning home one evening, and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Mincher carrying into the carriage \u2014 \" \" Stop, stop,\" said the Commissioners, repeating what I had said, and writing it down. \" You saw Mr. and Mrs. Mincher carrying into the carriage. Well ?\" \" Green baize bags containing plate, and \u2014 \" \" Stop, stop ; green baize bags containing plate. Well, was any one helping them ?\" \" No one ; they did all themselves.\" \" There was no one helping them. Well, who drove the carriage ?\" \" Mr. Mincher.\" \" Mr. Mincher drove the carriage, and Mrs. Mincher rode inside ?\" \" No,\" said I, \" Mr. Mincher drove the carriage ; Mrs. Mincher did not ride inside.\" \" J hen, Mrs. Mincher rode on the box. \" \" No,\" said I, \" Mrs. Mincher did not ride at all.\" \" Well,\" said the Commissioners, \" here is a very pretty confusion of ideas ; Mrs. Mincher was helping, and Mrs. Mincher was not helping. Did Mrs. Mincher hold the whip, and Mr. Mincher hold the reins ; or did Mr. Mincher hold the whip, and Mrs. Mincher hold the reins ? It is a very strange jumble.\" \" As I understand it,\" said the barrister, \" Mrs. Mincher, on this occasion, neither held the reins nor the whip; though, as I am informed, she usually holds both reins and whip.\" The creditors laughed at this joke, but the Commissioners did not see it. \" What are we to understand ?\" said they. \" Are we to under stand that Mrs. Mincher drove the carriage?\" \"No, your honours,\" said the barrister; \"Mr. Mincher on this occasion drove the carriage, though usually Mrs. Mincher drives Mr. Mincher.\" \" Well, but,\" said the Commissioners, \"Mr. Mincher kept a coachman. I have seen him driving. Had there been"], [440, "432 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. anything so unusual as Mrs. Mincher driving, I should have observed it. I must confess that though I have seen their carriage most days, I never saw the lady the Jehu.\" At this the creditors laughed very heartily, and the chairman of the Commissioners looked very bewildered. He did not see what they were laughing at. \" Will you allow me,\" said Mr. Goader; \" the witness says that Mrs. Mincher was helping.\" \" Yes,\" said the Commissioner, \" that I have down. Mrs. Mincher was helping Mr. Mincher.\" \" To do what ?\" said the barrister. The Commissioner looked more bewildered. \" I suppose to drive,\" said he; \" ask the question again.\" \" Wrhat was Mrs. Mincher helping to do ?\" \" To carry the plate into the carriage.\" The Commissioner looked at me over the top of his spectacles, and said, with a heavy judicial frown, \" Why did you not say that before ? Let your answers be clear, and not so muddled as to lead the Court astray. Mind what you are about : you look intelligent enough. Let me caution you, Sir, not to use your intelligence for the purpose of bewildering any one, especially not a Court of Justice, Sir, or you may find yourself in a very disagreeable position, Sir.\" I took this lecture in very good part. I thought it better as they had' the lion nnd unicorn on their side, and all tbe physical force the lion and unicorn represent. I could, therefore, only submit. I had committed no wrong, but that did not matter ; if the lion and uniccrn were roused the right would be of no consequence ; they must triumph. Justice in calm moments will poise the scales with even hand, but if the vanity of justice be stirred, she calls upon her big dogs (the lion and unicorn), and then you must submit, or be devoured. \" Now we have it,\" said the barrister. \" Mr. Mincher was carrying plate wrapped up in green baize bags into the carriage, and Mrs. Mincher was helping him to carry those green baize bags. Yes.\" He looked at their honours to see when they had written this down. \" Were there many of these bags ?\" \" Yes, I saw them carry iu nine.\" \" You saw them carry in nine,\" repeated the barrister very slowly. \" Were you there when they began to carry them in ?\" \" I think not.\" The Chairman of the Commissioners put down his pen, threw himself back, and said, \" This will not do. We must not have his thoughts ; be may think anything. Were you there when they began to carry"], [441, "THE REMOVALS. 433 these bags of plate you talk about ?\" \" I believe not.\" \" We cannot bave his thoughts and belief; he may think and believe anything. He swears that he saw nine bags ; have you anything else ?\" Upon this the barrister and Mr. Sparrow held a conversation together. At the end the barrister bowed to the Court, and said, \" That is my case.\" \" O,\" said the Com missioner, \" that is your case.\" \" That is your case, is it,\" repeated Mr. Goader. \" Then we will soon knock the bottom out of it. Young man, look at me. Have you and Mr. Mincher ever had a quarrel ?\" \" I have not,\" said I, making the I emphatic. \" You bave not ; then who else has ?\" \" I do not know.\" \" You do not know ; has your father and him had a quarrel ?\" \" No, uot a quarrel.\" \" Not a quarrel ; come, Sir, what do you mean, Sir, by that answer? tell me, Sir, was not Mr. Mincher compelled to take proceedings at law to make your father pay him an account he owed him?\" \"He did take proceedings at law.\" \" Then what do you mean by saying there was no quarrel ?\" \" I think proceedings may be taken without a quarrel.\" \"Think, Sir, we must not have your thinkings; the Court has already very properly corrected you for thinking ; we want none of your thoughts, Sir, we want something that is valuable. Mr. Mincher took proceedings against your father, and you thought if you ever had an opportunity you would repay him ?\" \" I did feel very much hurt at his conduct.\" \" And if you could would resent it ?\" \" Yes.\" I must here make a confession. My mother taught me when a child to always speak the truth ; that is a lesson I have faithfully obeyed. I have often seen that the truth, as on the present occasion, has been told at a time when, to those who heard it, it conveyed a wrong impres sion, and therefore, though truth to me, to them it was a falsehood, for the ideas received from my language were not the ideas that language was intended to convey, and crafty men, knowing this, have frequently obtained the truth from me and paraded it in a form which made it look like falsehood ; yet I cared not, I bave been faithful to my mother's lesson. \" Then,\" said Mr. Goader, \" we may safely conclude that Mr. Mincher was no friend of yours.\" \" You may.\" \" Now, where did you stand when, as you say, you saw this removal of goods ?\" \" Under the tree on the opposite side of the road.\" \" Under"], [442, "434 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. the tree on the opposite side of the road. You acted as a spy, then, and made your observations as covertly as you would have their honours believe the goods you talk of were removed ; that you call honourable conduct, I suppose ?\" \" I was surprised at the proceeding.\" \" You were surprised at the proceeding. Come, now, tell me, were you not glad of it, and thought the opportunity for revenge had arrived ?\" \" I was only surprised.\" \"Only surprised, eh! Now tell their honours what brought you under that tree. Come, Sir, no hesitation.\" \" I did not hesitate.\" \" Then why do you not answer ?\" \" It was a fine moonlight night, and 1 had been out to look at nature by moon light.\" \" You are fond then of looking at nature ?\" \" I am.\" \" Pray, Sir, can you tell me what nature is ?\" \" It is that succession of events which takes place around us without our direction or control ; events which have been in the past, are in the present, and will be in the future.\" \" Tell me, Sir, how that riddle is to be explained. How events present, events past, and events in the future, can be an identity \u2014 which you call nature ? \" Events which are repeated day after day, and year after year, with unvarying uniformity, may be said to obey laws which are their nature ; or the matter of which they consist, shapes and forms itself by changes so unvarying and uniform, that we may say it is its nature ; as when a flower or tree, or being of any kind, aggregates to itself atoms, until its form is complete, it grows by its nature, and when it decays, the matter of which it is formed obeys its nature, and is not annihilated, but enters into new combinations, in accordance with its nature.\" \" Young man,\" said the chairman of the Commissioners, let me advise you not to muddle your head with such speculations. They will lead you into infidelity, and infidelity will lead you into perdition.\" \" Not as I view such things,\" said I. \" On the contrary, a just appreciation of nature leads to fidelity ; for there is one plan in all things, the production of one mind, and that one mind is the soul of nature, by which we all move and have our being.\" \" I submit, your honours, that speculations like these are altogether out of place. Now, tell me, Sir, who was witb you on this occasion?\" \"No one.\" \"No one! Am I to understand that you ramble by moonlight alone ? You had no lady with you?\" \"I had not.\" \"You were by yourself?\" \"I was by"], [443, "THE REMOVALS. 435 myself.\" \" Now, tell me, Sir, are not you a little moonstruck ?\" \" If by moonstruck you mean fond of the moonlight, and apt to see beauties in the night which are not commonly seen, I am.\" \" Aye, following your own idle fancies ?\" \" Yes, perhaps so.\" \" Apt to imagine you see strange things, and hear hidden voices ?\" \" Perhaps so.\" \" Now, tell me, Sir, what sort of plate was this you saw removed ?\" \" Silver plate.\" \" Are you sure it was not plated plate ?\" \" I am not.\" \" You say you stood under the tree. Now, how far is that tree from the place you say you saw them removing this fanciful plate you talk about ?\" \" I suppose about thirty yards.\" \" Do you mean to tell this honourable Court that you could tell at thirty yards distance, by moonlight, that it was plate at all ?\" \" He has sworn it was plate,\" said one of the Commissioners, \" and we are bound to take his oath as evidence.\" \"But your Honours will please observe that he may have sworn not to a fact, but an inference. He saw something being removed, which something he in- fers was plate. He was at enmity with the bankrupt, and thought this an excellent opportunity to seek revenge for the imagined wrong his father had received. But, I submit to your honours, that there can be no wrong in any man seeking his rights. Our laws are happily just and impartial, and are administered with such justice, such wisdom, such acumen, and such great impartiality as to be the envy of the world. They are not the wisdom of the day, but the wisdom of ages ; not the production of one mind, but, like the civilisation by which we are blest, the results of the best thoughts of the wisest men the world has produced. Our laws are impartial, our judges are in- dependent ; our country is tbe land of freedom, of justice, and of law ; the home of religion, of love, and all the virtues wliich adorn our race. And it would be a strange thing if, in such a country, it were wrong for a man to seek his rights ; or, if by seeking his rights he were to raise a spirit of revenge, wliich should watch, viper like, for the proper moment to strike. The young man has made an inference, and it is to that inference he has sworn, and that inference he calls plate ; if he has not done worse \u2014 invented this fable ; and now the bankrupt is in trouble, steps forward to strike and destroy.\" I felt very much hurt at this charge, and attempted to refute it, but was met by the cry"], [444, "436 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. of \" silence !\" I persevered, but wa3 threatened to be committed if I were not silent. So, thought I, the boasted justice of the laws will allow a witness to be insulted, but not lo rebut the insult. Amid his neighbours and his friends a witness may be branded as a liar and an assassin, and if he attempt to defend himself the law will commit him to prison ; exalt the laws of your country in rounded and well-turned phrases, and you may insult whom you will. The laws are dead and inanimate rules and forms ; it is its officers who are the living spirits which animate and give it life. To praise the law is to praise its officers ; to praise a house is to praise its owner ; to praise the episcopate is to praise the episcopacy ; and to praise the throne is to praise the king who sits thereon. The one is inanimate, and cannot hear the laudations ; the other is vain, and the praise falls upon the ear like the sweet sounds of music, and is welcome. The law may be just and upright, and yet be so influenced by the bias of the administrator as to lose its character. The music poured out in rolling peals from the organ, or better, from the voices of many men, fills us with rapture, and we bow with admiration before the minds who conceived those glorious strains ; but if the same music squeaks from the penny trumpet, it doth but excite our laughter. So there are in the law aud other places penny trumpets, trying to discourse music which is beyond their compass ; but poor vain things, they think they squeak it out better than the organ can roll and peal out the grand music. \" Look at me, Sir,\" said Mr. Goader ; \" what sort of plate did you see \u2014 dishes, covers, tankards, or what ? \" \" It was plate.\" \" It was plate, was it? How do you know it was plate?\" \" I saw it shining in the moonlight.\" \" You saw it shining in the moonlight. Was it a cup? \" \" I cannot say.\" \" You cannot say. Was it anything but a moonbeam you saw ? \" \" They were bulky articles, in green baize bags, and like plate.\" \"I submit, your honours, the witness can swear to nothing but a moonbeam, and it is the first time I have heard that this Court considers that removing a moonbeam is a crime.\" Tertius Sandies, Esq., was about to re-examine me, but the Court said, \" We think you had better leave further enquiries into this subject to the assignee. It is very evident the witness does not know what he saw. With the information obtained something"], [445, "437 THE REMOVALS. may be done. You hear the witness has a wrong animus, and it would ill become this Court to allow itself to be influenced by anything he has said.\" There I was, subp\u0153naed against my will to give evidence, aud when I had given my evidence, which I honestly did, was not believed, but, on the contrary, branded with the infamy of having sought au opportunity to injure an old enemy, and to have trumped up a story tbat I might seek his ruin. I was in the presence of neighbours and friends, and I felt my reputation had suffered. I turned my back upon the Court, as did most of the creditors ; they comforted me with the reflection that \" we know you told the truth, but the truth does not suit them.\" The different attorneys gathered up their papers, the Court retired, the barrister and Mr. Sparrow went sailing through the street home again, the wire drawer stood with open-mouthed astonishment at the utter inutility of his opposition, the office was as soon as possible restored to its usual condition ; all separated. \" I took the way that pleased mysel', And so did death.\""], [446, "438 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LX. DEATH OF OLD JOE. As soon as I returned home, I was informed that Old Joe was much worse, and not expected to live. I therefore made all the haste I could to his cottage ; my mother was gone before me. When I arrived I went very quietly into his room ; my mother had put on a pair of list shoes that she might move about with out noise. She had drawn the curtains so as to darken the room, and had found napkins and table covers, as white as curd, and spread them over the tables aud other furniture. I could see by the creases that they had been folded up square, and the odour of them betrayed that they had been folded up for some time, and, as I supposed, a bunch of lavender had been kept in the drawer with them. I afterwards learned that these napkins and table covers were the work of his \"old wench ;\" that when she was alive she used them only on state occasions ; that they had been carefully put away, and this was the first time they had been used since her death. At the right hand of the bed, within Old Joe's reach, was placed a small round table, upon which my mother, woman like, had placed calves' foot jelly, blancmange, currant jellies, oranges, and lemonade \u2014 enough to last the old man for a month ;\u2022 \u2014 also his medicine. As I entered she had in her hand a basin of beef tea, and was cooling it with a spoon. She turned round to look at me, and said, \"Hush! the old man sleeps;\" but slight though the noise was, it was sufficient to disturb his slumber. He opened his eyes and said, with a very feeble voice, \" Wrho is that ?\" I gently approached his bed, and said, \" Joe, how are you?\" \"I am feeble, Master John, very feeble; I am glad you are come; my day is drawing to a close ; my sun is about to set in this world, to rise in another. I wanted to see"], [447, "DEATH OF OLD JOE. 439 you, Master John, to talk to you j and if I should die while you are here, as I feel I shall do, for you to see how an old man like me, who has never intentionally done a wrong thing, can die. I I do not feel, Master John, that I have any sin on my soul, and I have no fear in meeting my Maker,\" The old man said this in a feeble but firm voice, and my mother said, \" Have some beef tea, Joe, or some jelly\" I have often since thought what a happy thing it is for man that woman, his helpmate, his partner meet, is so good and so tender a nurse. She fills his last hours with comfort, and smooths his passage from this world to the next. \" Have this tea, Joe; you will find it very nice,\" and she kept cooling it with a spoon ; but he motioned with his hand to put it down. \" Have some, if it's only a spoonful ; it will do you good, Joe ; have some ;\" but he motioned with his hand to put it down. My mother seemed to think that if he would take some of the nourishing things she had provided that she could keep him alive, but the old man had neither desire nor appetite, and he put them on one side. I saw that his nose was very much pinched, that a pallor had suffused his face, that with both hands he was listlessly picking at the bed clothes, and that his eyes were glazed and moved about furtively. He attempted to diaw up one foot. I tucked up the bed clothes at the bottom of the bed. As I did so, I touched his feet. They were cold \u2014 cold \u2014 deadly cold. I was shocked at the discovery. Then, thought I, is it really death ? Is this good old man about to die ? Is that frame which has withstood the storms of so many winters about to dissolve, and the spirit which animated that lump of clay about to depart ? \" Master John,\" said he, \" I am going to leave you I am about to bid good-bye for ever to this world, Master John. I shall soon see my old wench again. I must say to this world, farewell ; to all, farewell ; to my friends, farewell ; to my companions who yet remain here, farewell ; to my children, farewell ! \" Here the old man's utterance was choked and husky, and tears rolled down his poor old face. \" They are scattered about the world, Master John. Master John, give me your hand.\" He pressed my hand between both his, and he looked at me so imploringly that I thought I should cry outright, and he said, \" Master John, be a friend to my children. If you see them going wrong, speak a good word to them ; a good word kindly spoken may save them"], [448, "440 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. from sin. They are my children, and my old wench's, and heaven will not be a complete heaven if we do not all meet together there. Speak a good word to them. Tell them it was my dying request, Master John, that you should speak a good word to them. When I am gone, they will have none to guide them in the right path but our Father who guides us all. Will you, Master John, will you promise me you will speak a good word?\" \"I will,\" said I. I was so moved that I could scarcely speak. \" Bless you,\" said he, \" bless you. Bend down your head, Master John. I bent down my head ; he put his hands upon it; he kissed my forehead, and said, \" Bless you, Master John, bless you, and may the Light of Ages, the Great Father of us all, bless you.\" My mother, 1 found, was sobbing, but she dried away her tears, and taking a glass of jelly in her hand, came to the bedside, and said, \" Have some jelly, Joe, if it's only half a spoonful ; it will do you good and comfort you.\" He looked at my mother; I thought he saw the kind ness which dictated her conduct, and he just tasted it, so that he might relieve her feelings ; for, poor old man, he was too near death for jellies, or nourishing diet, or medicine, or any other thing which the kindness or the skill of man could give, to be of use. \" Call my daughter, Master John.\" She came up, wiping her eyes with her apron, and he said, \" Come near to me, my child, and kneel by me.\" She did so ; he put his hand upon her head and said, \" It has pleased our Father, who is good to us all, my child, to call me home again. I shall soon be no more. Bless thee, my child, bless thee, and may our Great Father bless thee. When you see your brothers and sisters, tell them I have blessed them as I am blessing thee now. Tell them it was my dying wish that they should cleave to each other ; that they should encourage each other ; that they should support each other ; that they should love each other. Tell them my last prayer was that they should be good and kind to each other; that they should act to all the world rightly and justly, and love our Father, so that I and your mother may meet all of them in heaven. Tell them that if there should be one of them lost, to me there will be a shadow in heaven ; the dazzling brightness of its glory will have a shade. Be a good girl, and when the blandishments of the world tempt thee, be not thou tempted."], [449, "DEATH OF OLD JOE. 441 My child, I have blest thee, and if sin should ever tempt thee with its lures, remember that I have blest thee, and that memory will preserve thee spotless. Come near me, my child, that I may kiss thee,\" and he kissed her forehead as lie had kissed mine. His left hand was upon her head i he lifted up his right hand, looked up to heaven, and said, \" May the Father of us all bless thee. Oh dear ! what is this which is coming over me, which steals my senses and oppresses my heart ? It is not sleep, and yet it is like it ! My senses go, and I feel as if I could fly ! AVhat is it? Is it death, or do I faint ? If you please, Ma'am, will you kneel by my child, and, Master John, will you kneel down and offer up a prayer ? It will do us all good.\" I must confess that I felt a diffidence, if not a reluctance to pray. I had not been used to attend death beds, and not used to pray, except alone ; but I could not refuse. I took a prayer book which lay upon the table, and opened it to read one, but Joe put out his hand to forbid me, and said, \"Not that, Master John, not that ; do not pray from a book ; pray from the heart, Master John. There is no heart in a book, Master John; pray from the heart. It may not be as fine, Master John ; but our Father will not refuse it on that account. Let it come from the heart, and he will not mind its language. The poor man's prayer, though rude and uncouth in language, is welcome, if sincere. It is not language which makes the prayer, Master John \u2014 God understands us without language\u2014 but sincerity. Pray, Master John, pray.\" The old man put his hands together in the attitude of prayer, and looked upwards with an expression I have at no other time seen. I knelt, and prayed with the best language I had. As I finished, the old man said, \" Thank you, Master John, thank you ; my heart is comforted.\" My mother turned away and sobbed, but she hid her tears. His daughter sobbed audibly, as one almost broken-hearted. The old man said, \"Be comforted, my child, be comforted; the Lord will be your friend. I go to prepare a place for you. In our Father's house there are many mansions. Oh dear, it is coming again ! What is it? My senses go as if I should faint. Is it death? Is it death? Oh dear, is this death ? \" and the old man closed his eyes, as if he had swooned. My mother put up her finger, and said, \" Hush.\" She put her hand under the bed clothes and felt his"], [450, "442 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. heart. She stopped her own breath, as it were to listen, as she felt. She put her ear to his mouth, but she could not tell if the spirit had fled. I felt his pulse, and thought I could feel it beat with a very, very faint throb. My mother held n feather to his mouth, and we could just see that it moved. We hushed every souud, and stood at his bedside to watch the spirit take its last flight. After lying in this uncertain state a few moments he heaved a deep sigh, and said, \" Oh dear !\" He opened his eyes and looked about him with surprise, then said, \" Where am I ? Where have I been ? What have I done ? I thought I was a boy again, in my home. I thought my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters were there, just as it used to be when I was a boy. I thought it was the afternoon of the Lord's Day, and my father had got the good old Book before him, and was reading from it. 1 heard him, and I saw him, as I had used to hear and see when I was a boy, and he read from that good old Book \u2014 ' Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God ; believe also in me.' I saw my mother as I had used to see her, and when my father had done reading we all of us sang, as we had used to sing \u2014 1 Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no morel' and I thought I saw my father aud mother die, and all that I had done in my lifetime passed before me as if I were living it all over again. I seemed as if I went a courting to my Hannah, bless her, and all that we said to each other seemed to be said over again. I thought that I lived my life again, and our children were all born again, and grew again from children to men and women, and I thought I saw my Hannah sicken and die, and I grieved again for her as I grieved when I lost her ; and I thought that I looked upon the plains of heaven and saw them spread out like a silver sea of glory, in such dazzling splendour, that I wondered that I could look at them. I thought that my old wench was there, like a blessed angel, and she welcomed me with a smile until she almost made my old heart burst with joy. I thought I stood before the great throne and gave in the account of my life. The King, who sat thereon, read it, and he said, ' Welcome,' and then there was a sound of most ravishing music ;"], [451, "DEATH OF OLD JOE. 443 it seemed as if the whole hosts of heaven joined the song ; and my old wench introduced me in triumph to the souls of the righteous. 0 dear ; it was a blessed sight ! Master John, what was it ? Was it a sick fancy, or do the sick, just before they die, run over their past life, that they may take a true account to the Great Judge? O that some ghost from those blessed plains of heaven would come and tell us, then we mortals should know how to live and how to die. Master John, feel my legs ; I do not seem to have any ; do you feel them, Master John.\" \"I do,\" said I, but they were deadly cold \u2014 the touch of marble was not so cold as them. \" Ah,\" said he, \" I knew that I was dying ; I cannot feel you touch them. Draw the cur- tains, Master John, and let me look upon the glorious sky once again before I die. It is beautiful.\" It was beautiful ; the big sun was obscured, all but a very narrow margin ; a large cloud hid his splendour in crimson glory, and crimson glory glowed among the broken clouds. \"It seemed,\" the old man said, \"as if the clouds, the curtains of the night, were proud of the big sun they were about to canopy with folds upon folds of gold. He is going down, but will rise again to-morrow, to-morrow, and to-morrow will see his face again ; but I shall go down, and the curtains of eternity will be drawn around me \u2014 this world I shall know no more. Master John, hear a dying old man. As you go through life look for the flowers, and you will see the world all flowers ; look for the sunshine, and you will see it is all sunshine ; look for the kindness of human nature, and you will see that human nature is kind ; look for the goodness of God, and you will see that God is good. But, Master John, if you look for evil, you will thiuk the world all evil ; if you look for the faults in creation, you will think God a demon and not a good and kind Father. Oh dear ! my time is come. I know that it is. What is this that is come again ? My senses go, and I cannot see ; a film has come over my eyes, and I cannot see the glory of the sun. What is that?\" \"Where,\" said I, for the old man pointed with his bony finger to vacancy. \" There, there ; what is it ? Oh it is my Han nah. Bless thee, Hannah, bless thee ! I come; I come; I come;\" and the old man heaved a deep sigh, and his soul flew home. It is said that when the soldier dies upon the battle field his thoughts are of home, of his youth, aud of his native valleys,"], [452, "444 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and that during the short interval that ensues between his death wound and his death, his life passes before him as a panorama ; that it is not the glory for which he has fought which are his last thoughts upon earth, but home aud those who were dear to him ; but if he die of disease at home, he, in his last moments, mar shals his men again for battle, and the cries of war, of rapine, of pillage, and of glory are the cries with which he leaves this world for another. It is said that the miser hugs his hoards, and with a death-clutch thinks he can carry them to heaven ; the victims he has wronged appear before him, but he frowns at them ; and those he has ruined, but he grins at them. He leaves this life with horrid shouts and struggles, and meets the next with a dastard's fear. It is said that the sinner's wickednesses rise before him at his last hour like the spirits of the damned; that they fill him with madness, and are his horrid escort to judg ment ; they deliver up the history of his life, and he is con demned ; but Old Joe thought but of his children, of his parents, of his good life, and of his old wench ; he thought she came down from the realms of bliss for the purpose of escorting him there. \" His ruling passion was strong in death.\" Fare-thee well ; before I understood thee, I did thee wrong ; but now I have seen thy deep piety and thy strong love, I weep for thee. \" Forgive, blest shade, the tributary tear.\" When I come to die 1 would wish no better escort to judgment than thee, for I am sure thou wilt say a good word for me. I left the cottage. My mother, with the assistance of some other women, laid out his body. The sun went down in all his glory ; the clouds, which hung in the sky like crimson curtains, faded away ; the stars, the everlasting stars, came out like lamps of gold ; the moon rose in full glory, and seemed to sing a song of glory, eveu a p\u00e6an of victory. I heard the watch dog bark, and the ebbing and flowing of the distant waterfall ; all else was silent. It was a meet scene in which a good man should die. The earth was wrapped in the arms of silence, and the heavens were glowing with glory ; there was melancholy in the air, but it was a melancholy which far surpasses the rapture which joy can give. As I went along I let fall a tear of sorrow, and I said, \"Farewell, Old Joe, farewell. If there were more like thee in the world it would be happier than it is.\""], [453, "DEATH OF OLD JOE. 445 When they had laid him in his coffin I went in to see his body ; his soul had soared to the realms of bliss. My mother with a kindly spirit had put little rosettes of ribbon about the old man's shroud, and had ornamented his room with such flowers as she could procure, and with sweet smelling herbs ; kindness, womanly kindness, could not do more for him. I thought that wealth might have surrounded him with more costly show. Had he been a wealthy man, hatchments might have been hung out, ornaments of gold and silver might have been the decorations with which he would have been surrounded ; his coffin might have been ornamented with ornaments of price less value ; a star blazing with jewels might have rested upon the sere-cloth, and mutes have hung the head in mockery of woe. It might have been splendid, and have won admiration ; but it would not have gone to the heart as the poetry of poverty does, nor would it have been so solemn a sight as was the chamber of death where Old Joe lay, surrounded with the \"pennants of God,\" as he had used to call the flowers. I bent over his body, and said again, \" Farewell, old man, farewell ! Tf heaven is peopled with souls like thine, it is indeed a realm of bliss. We laid him in the same grave in which he had laid his old wench. It is an undistinguished mound of earth; the turf grows very green thereon ; in spring it is daisy pied. It may be but a fond fancy, but to me the moon shines brighter on that grave than on any other. There he lies, like so many more of the unobtrusive good men who have been in the world, with nothing but that little heap of turf to indicate that a good man lies beneath. Near thereto is a staring, vulgar sarcophagus, erected to the memory of a vain glorious man, who had no other virtues but wealth ; from his epitaph you would believe him to be a nonpareil ; but, faugh ! he was only vulgar and vain. The worshippers of wealth thought him great, but the lovers of virtue turn their backs upon him in silent contempt. But so it is ; the good lie in undistinguished graves, while tbe wealthy and worthless have staring monuments erected to their memory. There are memories perpetuated in marble that it would be better for the world they were forgotten, while there are num bers like that of Old Joe that ought for ever to be green, and there is nothing to indicate where they lie."], [454, "446 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LXI. A VALENTINE. What a strange thing is life ! In one house there is the sound of woe, and bitter tears are shed in mourning and bereavement ; in another there are the jocund tones of joy ; good fortune has made a visit there, and all is hilarity and mirth ; in one there is such plenty and profusion that the board overflows, appetite is lost iu satiety, pride wraps itself up in silken dignity, and dozes away its existence in the fulness of fat ; in another there is the wailing of want, children crying for bread, and the mother grieving that she has not wherewithal to feed them; in one there is the woe which misfortune brings, in another there is the misery of sin ; in one there is all the chicanery of life, in another there is the dignity and simplicity of nature; the sun shines on all alike ; he holds on his irresistible course and heeds none of these things. Old Tom was cleaning his \" hosses ;\" he had the brush in his right hand, and his curry comb in his left, and was full of glee. \" I've done it,\" said he ; \"I wonder what her'll say. Who'd a' thought it now, as that 'ere old uncle o' mine as went out to Botany Bay should a' made a fortin seein' as how he used to toss me on bis knee when I was a chubby-faced child, and sing ' Ride a cock horse to Banbury cross, to see what Tommy can buy; a penny white loaf, and a penny white cake, and a tuppenny apple pie.' Who'd a' thought it now.\" As he said this, he tossed his brush and his currycomb upon his knee, just as if he were tossing himself when he was a cherry-cheeked baby ; then he ran to the bottom of the gate way and peeped round the corner as if he were afraid of being seen; then he ran back again, looking at Peggy through the bar"], [455, "A VALENTINE. 447 window as slily as if he were going a courting ; then raising his shoulders and bursting into a giggling laugh, said again, \" I've done it ; I wonder what her'll say.\" \" Quiet now, will yer, my little wench, quiet.\" This was said to the mare he was cleaning as she turned round to bite him and lifted her hind leg as if to kick. \" Quiet now ; a' done will yer ! I've done it ; I wonder what her'll say.\" The last expression evidently did not refer to the mare, but to some other \" her,\" and to something that Tom had done, else why should he say, \" I've done it ; 1 wonder what her'll say ?'' Tom was talking to himself, but every now and then he interjected the expression, \"I've done it; I wonder what her'll say.\" \" Now if I told anybody as how my old uncle as went to Botany Bay had left me a fortin', what would they say ? Why this 'ere : ' VA hat was he sent there for ?' But he weren't sent there at all, he went himself. I dare say there's a good many deep uns there ; I knowed some of um, I did ; I knowed Crack Charley, I did, as was sent there for making flimsies ; he was a good un, he was ; he spent money as if it was nothin' ; why he's many a time hired me to drive him from public to public all the day long. I could a' plenty, I could ; those was the days, those was ; he was a deep un, he was, and no mistake; got money fast, and spent it fast ; ali'ays stood trate, he did ; and so fond of the girls, he was, 'specially the merry uns ; he knowed um all, and they knowed him, they did ; he was a gemman, he was ; he knowed all the constables in this town, and in this 'ere country, he did, and none on um could tek him, none on um could; he was a deep un, he was, and if it hadn't a' bin for flash Nan he never would a' been took, no he wouldn't ; but flnsh Nan never did no good arter that, her dain't ; when he was lagged we all on us gin him a rally ; he was a fine fello', he was ; if flash Nan hadn't a' put that 'ere constable into that 'ere cupboard and made a plant on it while the man as pretended as how he was a horse dealer when be was a constable \u2014 and flash Nan kcowed it, for her was up to tbe plant, her was \u2014 he never would a' been tuk, no he wouldn't ; but flash Nan never did no good ; nobody looked on her arterwards, and the money ber got for it dain't last ali'ays, and paint wouldn't mek her look pretty ali'ays, and it dain't ; her was like one as 'as done wrong and knowed it ; her dain't hold up her head, her dain't ; her'd"], [456, "448 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. got that in her busum as wouldn't let her, her had ; a bit o' gold had tempted her to betray her pal, a bit o' gold had ; an' when it was gone it was gone, it was ; but there was summut left in her busum and it stopt there, it did, and it would stop. The gold left her in a day or two, but that as was in her busum wouldn't, and it dain't, and ber couldn't mek it ; her tried drink, but, Lord bless yer, that was no use, that made it wus, that did ; nothing 'ud mek it goo ; it stopt in her busum till her died. And how did her die ? ah, how did her die ? that's all. Her cronies wouldn't look at her, her cronies wouldn't. Her was tainted, her was, like as if her'd got the leprosy, and everybody turned their backs on her ; her was tainted, her was, aud there was nobody so tainted as her ; her was deserted, her was, aud there was nobody so deserted as her ; her was miserable, her was, and there was nobody so miserable as her. Her'd got that in her busum as her knowed on, her had. Nobody else had sold their pal for gold. There was nobody like her, so nobody took pity on her. Her died in a ditch. There her lay just like one as wern't right in her head, and her kept maundering about her home and her mother, and her pal as her'd sold for gold. There her lay in the ditch, and her died there. The next morning her was found dead ; nobody knowed wben her died, and nobody cared. Every body said it served her right, but I think as how a woman if her is a bad un, oughtn't to die like that. Yet her shouldn't a' done it, her shouldn't a' sold her pal; her was a bad un for that, her was ; but her shouldn't a' died iu a ditch.\" Bap, tat, tat. \" Hark, he's a-comin'. I've done it ; I wonder what her'll say.\" The rap, tat, tat, which had diverted Tom's thoughts, was the rap, tat, tat of the postman. Whatever it was that Tom had done, was something in which the postman was concerned. It was plain what Tom had been down the gateway for, and had been looking up the street for, and had been listening for, was the postman ; and, from the manner in which he looked through the bar window, Peggy was concerned with it in some way. O Tom, Tom, what have you been doing ? you naughty, wicked, lecherous man, what have you been doing? Have you some designs upon Peggy's happiness ? You naughty man, you have been sending her a valentine. 0 fie, Tom, I had thought better of you ; a man of your age to be sending"], [457, "449 A VALENTINE. valentines ; shame, shame ! \" He's a-comiu',\" said Tom, \" I've done it ; I wonder what her' 1 say ; but who'd a' thought it as my old uncle should a' died so rich, and a' left me that five hundred pounds. What shall I do with it when I've got it ? Ah. that's it, Tom, Tom, that's it; what will yer do with it? If Peggy says 'Yes,' I'll set up a public ; but if Peggy says ' No,' what shall I do then ? I'll spend it all in drink and die in glory. I'll be a victim to the tender passion and die for love. I'll mek a will, and tell um to bury me where the sun shines, and plaut the flowers the girls call \" Love-lies-a-bleediu' \" on my grave, as an example to all young men like me; when they see it they'll like it, and die tor love as I did, and as every true-hearted coachee should do. If her should say as how my uncle was transported, I'll tell her he weren't, and so he weren't. He went of his own free will ; he weren't sent, and he made the money himself, he did. Her's so good, her is, her wouldn't like money as weren't got all right her wouldn't. Her ain't like some folks her ain't ; don't care how the money's got so as it is got ; will ruin anybody so as how they get the money, and sleep none the worse for it, and folks 'ud think none the wus on um for it, if they'd got the money, but if they've spent it, and ain't got it, call um all manner o' names.

Her's a good un, her is. I've done it ; I wonder what her'll say.

But this young man who loved her, he fell in luck, In his purse tbe bright guineas did shine ; Says he, ' Now I'm rich, perhaps she may be struck, And consent to be my valentine.' \" \" Ha ! ha ! ha ! \" laughed Tom. \" That's capital ; just like me, tbat is.

I call that a good valentine ; it's natural ; such as we sees with young men like me any day. There's no Cupids, and no hearts, and no skewers. Hearts may be all very well when they are stuffed with lemon, thyme, aud bread and suet, and well cooked, but not in a valentine ; it ain't natural. Let tbe roses and the posies alone. Give me summut as is natural, as a young man like me can understand.\" Tom ran down the yard to peep through the bar window at Peggy, as she sat in the chair, reading her valentine. Now Tom had not only sent her a valentine, but he had sent her a proposal. His uncle had left him five hundred pounds, so he thought the time was come to marry and keep a public. Tom thought valentines were love letters, and sending love letters looked like business, so he had added business to the love, and proposed \u2014 \" If you'll be mine, I'll be thine, And we shall shine Two valentines.\" \" Peggy, if you'll be mine, I'll be thine. My uncle's left me five hundred pounds, and we'll go and keep a public ; but if you won't it's all up with poor old Tom ; he'll die for love. So, Peggy, say ' Yes,' and tell me when it shall be. I'll love you for ever and ever and ever, until death do us part, and longer if I can. 'Ihat's how I love her, and if her don't love me again, I'm a dead un, I am, and the luck as 'as brought me five hundred pounds is no luck for me, no it ain't. Ah ! how it is when a man gets rich iu a hurry, as I have ; he's proud and feels himself high like. When I was poor I dain't feel high ; I was humble ; but now I have heard of my riches, I'm high, and want to marry Peggy, aud keep a public. I want to be a master landlord, and I want Peggy to be a landlady and a missis. As soon as I gets iny money, her shall have a new silk gown, better than the missis's, and I shall tell the missis as Peggy ain't a-goin' to be put upon ; no, Peggy ain't. I have got a fortin' left me, and Peggy's going to be a leddy ; I am going to mek her one, I am. When her's got a new silk gown, a gipsy cloak, and a gipsy hat, her'll be a leddy, her will ; and when I've got my fortin' her shall have"], [459, "451 A VALENTINE. um ; and I'll have kerseymere smalls, top boots, a blue coat with gilt buttons, and a velvet westcoat with flowers all over it, and a beaver tile ; and then there'll be a leddy and gemman, finished and turned out complete, equal to any leddy and gemman. I know it, I know it all. I ain't been a coachee all these 'ears without knowing that it's the tailor as meks the gemman, and the dressmaker as meks the leddy. When you've got the fine clothes and the gold in yer pocket, it's easy enough to learn the lingo. ' Hha ! Hbear! yhou Sir ! Light my scigar ! ' Use the h's ; put h's where h's are, and where h's isn't ; you can't put too many on um ; and then you're a gemman, and a tip-top gemman. Get the dress and get the lingo \u2014 then you're a gemman.\" Tom knelt down by the bar window to look through the little strip of window below the bottom of the curtain, to see Peggy read the valentine. In sending this valen- tine, Tom had made several mistakes, arising from his inex- perience in love matters. Love was a something he had only studied in sixpenny song books, and he thought he should do it as they said it should be done. They said it should be done in valentines, and sbft flattery ; at least, love where it is love, but where it ain't love the lady wants a settlement from the gentle- man, and the gentleman wants a settlement from the lady's father : and then, if there's any love it comes, and if it do not come it stops away ; it is not of much consequence which ; or, as Tom put it, \" That 'ere sort o' love was like flash Nan's love, done for money, which yer pay for as yer go on ; and when you've done it you've done it, that's all ; but that ain't the sort o' love to live on, as'll be strong when there's trouble, and kinder-like in the dark days, as'll grieve when ye're in the grave, the t'other will be glad when ye're dead, and look out for another settlement.\" Tom had sent a valentine when it was not Valen tine's day, and he had made a proposal of marriage iu the valentine, the very last place such soft tenderness should be committed ; but Tom, in bis simplicity had done it, aud he thought it all right. As Tom looked under the curtain he saw Peggy sitting in her chair, turning the letter over and over, and wondering where it could come from. She studied the direction and made guesses at the handwriting. She held it up to the light to see if she could see through it. She examined the"], [460, "452 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. seal and tried to decipher its contents, Tom had sealed it with the handle of his currycomb, so very little intelligence could be obtained from that. She opened it, looked bewildered, then burst out in an uncontrolled fit of laughter. Tom was chap fallen ; all his fond hopes had fallen as suddenly as a house of cards. \" It's a valentine,\" said she, \" and it's not Valentine's day. Ha, ha, ha! why it's from that foolish old Tom. Ha, ha, ha ! Well, I never. 0 this love, how silly it does make these men, to be sure. He break his heart, his heart is too tough for that. Ha, ha, ha ! When there has been no courting, neither. Ha, ba, ha ! 0 what a silly simple man he is; at least, I don't know of any courting ; we have joked with each other. Ha, ha, ha ! We have joked with each other ; but it's cuddling that is courting, and lonely walks by moonlight, and not joking. Ha, ha, ba ! To think of making a proposal of marriage in a valentine. Ha, ha, ha ! O Tom, Tom, what a silly old pate yours is I\" She read it again, and laughed at it again. Tom was all the time peeping under the curtain in that peculiarly unpleasant state of mind in which a man feels he has done a very foolish thing, aud is the object of ridicule. Love is a very serious matter to lovers. It will sometimes upset tbe whole mental fabric, and produce a settled melancholy for life. It will sometimes cause its victim, whose nerves are all too finely strung, to fall away into an untimely grave, and will sometimes, like a fire never quenched, glow on and on, though unrequited. 'Ihe world and its fortunes have made men unequal, but nature has so strung the human heart that it vibrates to the same harmonies. The love which makes the poor village maiden bend in sorrow for her lost one penetrates and lives in the heart of a queen, although environed with the pomp and dignily of state, with a deep feeling of bereavement, as if the heart could never forget the days of love, when love was a blessing, but alas, had become an inconsolable sorrow. But however important love may be to lovers, to those who are not, it is an orij.-ct of ridicule. Tom did not like the way his missive was received. He thought it all over with him ; that he should become a suicide, and put the coroner to the trouble of bringing in a verdict of \"Died for love.\" Just as he had arrived at this conclusion Peggy folded up the valentine, kissed"], [461, "A VALENTINE. 453 it, and put it in her bosom, and said he was a very foolish man, but there were worse than him.

A PLOT The wire-drawer was utterly bewildered at the result of the first meeting in bankruptcy. He had been foolish enough to believe that strength of temper and determination of purpose would be all-powerful ; that he and his barrister had only to appear to conquer. He did not seem to have fixed in his own mind the end he proposed to accomplish, whether to make the bankrupt \u2014 who, if honest, had lost his all, and some of that which other people had entrusted to him \u2014 pay him when he had not where withal to pay, or to punish him criminally for having, as he said, \" cheated him.\" Like all of his class, he thought he had only to express his feelings to the world and the world would follow his lead. He thought all men felt as he felt, and were indignant at that which raised his indignation. That which other people called and knew to be misfortune, he called crime ; indeed, with him every bankrupt was a criminal, no matter what was the cause of failure. Every one who could not pay his way was a trickster and a cheat; therefore, as the Court would not chime in with his wishes and his passions, the Court was in league with the bankrupt, and would assist him to cheat all his creditors. To him, his individual calamity was a great calamity \u2014 indeed, the only calamity of the day \u2014 one which should make the world stand agape and suspend all action while they punished the fellow who had brought it about, and he was astonished that men went to and fro and took no heed of his cries. Men were full of their own troubles, and left the idle and those who are fond of a sensation to busy themselves with the troubles of others. But it was him ; he bad cheated him, which was the crime. Had he cheated any one else it might have been a matter of laughter, if"], [463, "455 A PLOT not of admiration. He would have said as others said, \" He was a deep one ; he had taken in the knowing ones ; shrewd men of business, who you would think were up to every dodge, he had taken iu as if they were simple, inexperienced babes,\" when, perhaps, the simple truth was, that he had not only brought loss to them but ruin to himself. Men do not look at the fact, but are carried away by the comment some phrasemonger puts upon the fact ; to follow the thoughts of others is easier than to think for one's self, and in intellectual idleness or intellec tual poverty, the thoughts of others hold the mastery. But it was he who was cheated \u2014 as if cheating him was a crime for which no atonement could be made. There was a time when the man who was the debtor of another became that other's property, and was sold into slavery. Who can tell the misery which in those days was heaped by man upon his fellow man? If it were possible to select one from the group of many, and paint in words but a few phases of his misery, the world would turn their backs upon it as an overdrawn picture, and would not believe that \" man's inhumanity to man \" was so unfeeling and so cruel. Now it is not enough that man is reduced from affluence to poverty, but every little soul must have a fling at him ; a thief, a housebreaker, and a murderer even will be left to the laws of the land, and when the laws of the land have punished, their crime passes from the memory of man ; but men do not think the laws of the country punish the unfortunate enough, and every means is therefore taken to supplement the laws, and he is but too often made the scapegoat to carry away the sins of others. The wire-drawer went to Mr. Sparrow's office, with all his feelings of astonishment. As he entered, Mr. Sparrow said, \" Well, what did you think of the meeting yesterday ?\" The lawyer wished to know what was Ihe opinion of his client before he committed himself in any way by expressing an opinion of his own. \" Think,\" was the reply ; \" I never saw such a farce iu my life. Here is a man who has cheated us all, perhaps ruined some of us ; he is brought before men whose duty it is to examine into his roguery and punish him for it, and when it is laid before them, and witnesses are there to swear to it, they do not believe it, but help the rogue through. I should like to know of what use such a Court is to us?\" \" Of what, indeed?\""], [464, "456 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. said the law7er. \"instead of punishing him for his misdeeds, they throw the mantle of the law over them and cover them. You saw we did all we could, and fought for you as well as we could, but it is all of no use ; they do not and they will not understand things except in their own way. You may as well whistle jigs to pigs when they are inclined for a dance as argue with them \u2014 argument is thrown away upon them.\" \"What else can be done ? Cannot we take some other step? Cannot we move for a new trial ? Is there no way of punishing him ? Is he to get through the Court in a canter? What laws are these we live under? They are made for nothing else than rogues, and excuse me saying it, but I must say it, for nothing else but rogues and lawyers \" \" Ha, ha, ha !\" laughed Mr. Sparrow. \" We lawyers do very well by them : they require so much of our help, our attention, and assistance, unfortunately. You cannot expect us to work for nothing. I wish it were otherwise. We are very often blamed for the expeusiveness of the law, when it is not our fault at all ; we are but instruments in the matter ; we only do what the law requires of us, and often not that, yet our bids are sufficiently large, and then we are not half paid for our trouble. Conveyancing is the business we prefer ; it pays best, aud gives more satisfaction. It is not the business I am doing for you that pays. I shall lose money by it, and after all, perhaps, do you no good. Look here now ; \" as he said so he reached down the printed list of a law stationer, which hung over the fireplace \" This is the list of some of the forms in bankruptcy which this man keeps always on hand printed. I can send my clerk to him and get any one of these forms ready printed from his stock, and shall have only to fill in the blanks. Count them, Sir ; there are two columns you see. Count them, there are two hundred and sixty-three of them, and these are not all the forms which are sometimes required ; they are only the forms for common and usual cases. Now is it to be won dered at that the proceedings are expensive, and that we some times lose our cause because we do not put in the identical form required in the identical place. If the spirit of Lord Mansfield were to return to earth, he would not be able to walk through these intricacies without error. Sir, it requires all our attention, all our faculties, and all our penetration to conduct our case"], [465, "A PLOT 457 successfully. If we do the right thing ct the wrong time it may spoil the case. We cannot carry anything at law by storm ; all must be done by sapping and mining. It is not strength which wins ; we must work like the mole; we must undermine, destroy the foundations, prepare all for the last blow, and even then crouch before we spring Open-hearted men like you, with warm tempers, think that honesty will always hold its own; it is a delusion, Sir, a false opinion ; it is the man who is most aware of tbe forms wh'ch are required. A knave, Sir, if he keeps to the torms, will win, while honesty, if he depend upon his honesty, like a poor innocent fool, will lose. Now, Sir, I think you see how the matter stands.\" Much of this was said to prepare the wiie-d awer for the bill which would have to be delivered ; some of it to prepare him for the failure which was anticipated, and the remainder to prove to him that the violent course he had pursued would not win. \" What am I to do then ? Am I to stand by and lose ? Am I to let the man pass and not oppose ? Is he to rob us, then go to the Court, and when we try to get our own, is he to shake his protection at us, laugh in our faces, and say, ' That will stop you, lad ?' Are the laws made only for the protection of the criminal ? Call you this a commercial country, governed by commercial laws, and yet we are not able to get our own ? \" Mr. Sparrow's keen eye saw that his advocacy was winning. Heretofore the wire-drawer had spoken in the singular number. \" He has cheated me ; I will let him know ; cheat me, indeed.\" He had now dropped that form of speech, and begun to talk in the plural. It was \" rob us; shake nis protection in our faces ; shall not we get our own?\" When his individual interest was merged in the general interest it was evident to Mr. Sparrow that his words were making the desired impression. \" I say,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \"that it is a shame that the laws of the land should be as they are. I do not defend the laws, nor do I intend to defend them. It is my duy, as a professional man, to take them as they are, and make the best I can of them for the benefit of my clients. If, by any direct appeal to tbe laws, I cannot advance my client's interest, I must do as all in the profession do, look out for some form in the law whose consequences, or as we say, whose incidents will accomplish the objects I have in view. I must get justice by"], [466, "458 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. means of injustice, if you like. I must let the end justify the means, and it will be strange if, among all its incidents, I shall not find some which will suit your case. I have already called your attention to the great number of forms there are in the law of bankruptcy. Now you know that in the game of chess there are sixteen pieces and sixteen pawns, who make their various moves upon sixty-four squares ; that there is no man yet so much master of the game but some other man can conquer him. In that game the players conceal the attack, and win by stratagem, and not by direct force. The attack may become overwhelming, but the position is gained by stratagem. Every regular opening has a regular defence, which good players know ; but irregular and wayward openings admit of no set defence. So in law ; the forms \u2014 two hundred and sixty-three \u2014 as you see upon that list, are as the men in chess, which are but sixteen a side, and the chess board of the law has many more squares than sixty-four ; and I may safely say this, that no man has ever lived who has been master of all the moves. The difficulties and the complica tions of chess, Sir, are nothing to the. difficulties and complications of law. Your case must be won by stratagem ; and it is by stratagem we mean to win.\" \"What,\" said the wire-drawer, who, with all his violence, was a simple man, \" do you mean to tell me that the men who sit in judgment \u2014 who pretend to such purity \u2014 who will not permit even a suspicion of their honesty to be uttered \u2014 will permit the crafty and tbe far-seeing to win by stratagem?\" \" Tut, tut, man, you do not understand me; they are just the same as the umpires who preside at a chess tourna ment ; they sit by and watch the moves. If every one is legiti mate and according to rule, they admit the moves. They may see the stratagem ; they have nothing to do wdth that ; if every move is in form and order they are admitted. There may have been a time when the form was to protect the spirit; but now all the spirit or mind of the Judges is to protect tbe form. Common sense may be found in juries ; but our officers do all they can to entrammel them with forms. Their decisions sometimes step in and shatter the most beautiful cases \u2014 cases in which the skill of the lawyer and the advocate is most highly finished, and I may say sublime.\" \" But,\" said the wire-drawer, \"perhaps the cases are unjust.\" \" Tut, tut, man ; let me tell you, once for all, it is"], [467, "459 A PLOT not justice we admire, but victory. If we get the victory when the case is manifestly unjust, there is the more merit. There is no fame nor profit in justice; they are found in its opposite. Justice is well enough for a flag ; but like a great many other flags under which men arrange themselves and fight, it is only a pretence. We must take things as they are, and do our best with them. Now I think I have cleared away some of the fog which obscured your vision. If so, let us see how we shall meet your case. Goader has already bought off Biteum. What I propose is this, that we should oppose and harass the bankrupt at every possible turn ; that we should make his life miserable ; that we should bring any and every charge against him, and insinuate more than we charge ; that we should make our opposi tion so formidable that he will be glad to come to some arrange ment to abate the opposition, and then our debt and expenses are safe.\" \" But if he has given up all, how can he pay ?\" \" It is not our business to enquire how he can do it ; we must make him do it. If he has made any little purse for himself, he must shell out of that ; if his wife's jointure can be mortgaged, he must mortgage that ; if he have any friends left to him after this wreck of his fortune, he must get them to help. The more outrageous our proceedings are, the more we shall excite their compassion. It is not for us to care where the money comes from; we must have it.\" \" Then you propose that we should make his life miserable \u2014 so miserable that he will do anything to remove the pressure that we put upon him \u2014 perhaps commit forgery aud get transported.\" \"Well, my good man, what is that to us? We get the money and he gets the punishment. Ha, ha, ha. A fair division. In the law, Sir, things are fairly divided.\" \" Perhaps,\" said the wire-drawer, \"you may have to prosecute him.\" \"Well, well, I cannot help that. It is business, you know, it is business ; and as a man of business I must attend to my business.\" \" I must say,\" said the wire-drawer, \" yours is a capital good plan ; but can we work it ? Will the Court help us to work it?\" \"My good man,\" said Mr. Sparrow, putting his right hand upon the wire drawer's left shoulder, and looking him full in the face, as if to discover, from the working of his countenance, whether he accepted the advice in simplicity, or whether both of them were equally crafty \u2014 \"My good man, the Court will assist us in anything."], [468, "460 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. I do not mean to say that if I explained my plan to the Court as I have explained it to you, that they would assist us; but my object will be to conceal my plan from them. They from experience, may suspect, but the Couit will not act from suspicion- ; it will only act from the facts or such fie ions as we can present to them in the garb of facts. From our knowledge of this hibit we can dress up fictions in such a form that the acutest man will believe them to be fncts. You have attended a theatre, and seen in that mimic world a story told which you went to hear wiih the full knowledge of its imaginative parentage, yet you felt all your emotions stirred as if the fiction were a reality passing before your excited senses. A court of justice is in some measure a stage, in which none are in earnest but the litigants. There is many a comedy and many a tragedy acted out there by poor players It is a different stage, but none the less histrionic on that account. The players there, like the players on the mimic stage, took to the calling as much for the fame as the wage. Fame's loud clarion may fascinate for awhile; yet, when the plaudits of the multitude cease to charm on both stages, the love of wage remains. Now, as I say, I shall not go to the ( ourt and explain my plan, but I shall use the forms who-e incidents will give me the victory. There is money in the estate, and we shall be able to procure adjournment after adjournment, until we have wearied him into compliance.\" \" It is a good plan,\" said the wire- drawer ; \" but do you think the Court will grant the necessary adjournments?\" \"Theie is nothing so ea'y. There are too many of the Court and about the Court who gai.i by them ; they, therefore, are matters of profit to all. It has been said that every man has his price ; and it may be my profession has given me a partial though g'eat experience; but I mu-t endorse the saving Men will make great professions of disinterestedness, but unless they stand upon a substratum of gold, th-y are nothing but prifis-ious which they hope will some day bear fiuit. \" Well,\" said the wire-drawer, \"I will leave the matter in vour hanos for you to do the best you can \" \" That is a wise decision. I will do my best for you. You will still threaten vengeance ; but be sure you do not mention to any one our plan. Secrecy is essential to success. I wish you good morning. If any one calls upon you, refer them to me. Good morning.\" As soon as the"], [469, "A PLOT 461 wire-drawer had left, the lawyer said to himself, \" There ; that is so far successful. The mad bull is yoked and muzzled. It is easier to subdue a fiery tempered man than a crafty cool man. A fiery tempered man says more than he means ; a crafty man very much less. Of the two give me the fieiy one. I have pre pared him for failure iu my plan, and yet have given him sufficient reason why he should go on. He has money, and he has means. Some of those must be mine. Talk of justice in the law ! Its numerous forms give us the power of making bills \u2014 give to the rich man the power of oppressing the poor man, and the crafty man the power of ruining the honest man. What to me are the feelings of men ! Nothing but counters with which to play the game of fortune. Men admire wealth, and I must have what men admire. This poor simple man believes my energies are devoted to his interest. Pshaw ! What is he to me? Only as the lamb to the epicure \u2014 a damty dish whereon to dine; or as the widow's son to the soldier who is urged on with mad cries to mount the deadly breach and leave his body there, while he who commands wins honour, renown, and wealth. 1 have no sickly sentimen tabties ; they are out of place in my office. We are sometimes accused of fawning. What does the accusation matter? We gain if we fawn ; and if fawning no longer serves, we can turn round and sting. My profession isolates me from mankind. I walk among them, and feel that friendship is inconvenient. If I form such foolish embarrassments, I may have to take proceedings against some of them. Then what will the world say of me ? My only safe position is in isolation. Therefore let me follow my instincts, like the worm which never dies, and live upon my fellow men.\""], [470, "462 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. CHAPTER LXIII. A SUMMONS. Mr. Twittles and his fellow clerk were examining a draft, the younger one was reading it over as rapidly as he could, and all in one tone, drawing a short breath at long intervals, and giving his head a jerk at the same time ; shortening the words of frequent occurrence, as \" stors.\" for administrators, \" exors.\" for executors, and \" signs.\" for assigns. It required a large amount of practice to read so fast without mistakes, and for Mr. Twittles to follow him, and at the same time to correct such as were made ; but for amusement they had frequently pitted themselves against each other as to which could do it in the shortest time, one to check and the other to read, so that great skill had been attained by this competition. When the reading was nearly finished the door bell rang, the pull which hung dangling between them was drawn, and the reading went forward if possible more rapidly. Mr. Levy entered in a state of alarm, but the reading was persevered in until finished without giving him any answer to his enquiries. The reader finished nearly out of breath, and said, \" There, I have done it in half a minute less time than you.\" \" Is Mr. Goader in ?\" said Mr. Levy. \" He is,\" said Mr. Twittles. \" Will you take in my name and ask if he can see me ?\" While this was being done Mr. Levy was walking about the office in great agita tion, first looking up at the ceiling, then at the floor, then heaving a sigh, then beating a tattoo with his foot. \" He will see you in one minute.\" Did you ever have tbe misfortune to wait in a lawyer's office during one minute; have you watched the clock move one miuute, two minutes, three minutes, and go tick tacking on until thirty minutes and forty minutes had passed before the one minute you were waiting for had elapsed ? Have you looked"], [471, "463 A SUMMONS. at the several persons who have been waiting with you, and watched on some of their faces the deep traces of trouble, and on those of all anxiety ? Have you, during the time you have been waiting, let loose your imagination, and endeavoured to read the particular sorrow of each? The world of fiction tells of many griefs, of many sorrows, of many trials ; but had you sense like that of sight with which you could look into the minds of men and read there the untold sorrows which policy and necessity wrapped up in the secret recesses of each ! Think you there is any pen can describe the truth, any painter who can limn the scenes, any good Samaritan who can pro duce the oil which would sooth and allay the untold sorrows this magic sense would display ? Think you that the world of fiction, with all its glowing descriptions, could present anything like those this magic sense would discover ? Or are you one of those who walk through the world and turn not aside to look at the troubles or the struggles of your fellows ? Have you all your days been so nestled in the lap of plenty that the shadows which bechill others have not been seen by you ? Have your days been all sunshine? Have none of the storms of life crossed your path? If so, I am sorry for you, for the troubles of life make its joys more exhilirating, as the sunshine which follows the storm is the most lovely sunshine, for then the sky is more clear, the flowers send out a better perfume, and tbe birds sing a more joyous song. You may think yourself favoured if you pass through life without a storm. Yes, you are favoured just as is the mollusc which lives in ocean's bed, beneath the influence of storms, and dozing away a sleepy existence, shuts itself up in its own shell and mistakes its uneventful life for a halcyon state of happiness. No, if you have not known trouble you know not the joys which the sympathy of your fellows gives ; or, better than all, how deep and unchanging is a true woman's love. As soon as Mr. Goader was at liberty, Mr. Levy entered his office. \"Good morning,\" said Mr. Goader; \" take a seat. I think we got through that business at the Court very well.\" \"Look at that,\" said Mr. Levy, and, without any preliminary observations whatever, he placed in his hands a printed paper, about six inches broad and ten inches long. It was printed the long way. The blanks were filled in with a scrawling writing."], [472, "464 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. At the top were the lion and unicorn, and at one corner was a magical looking mark, about as large as a shilling. Oh, Sir, you do not know what amount of ceremony there is in affix ng that mark ; you had better lose your life and send your soul to the place were the fire is never quenched than make one like it. It means the majesty of the law, and has come down to us from a far antiquity, when even the men who sat in judgment had to make a mark, and that mark was the seal which they \"sealed with the signet.\" Nay, Sir, we read that of old the king sealed with his signet, and never that he wrote bis name. That mark should be worshipped ; you should bow down your head in the Eastern fashion, and touch it with your forehead, for it is as the holy of holies, though there are some people so profane as to say that if it were not for the fee that is paid tor impressing it, it would long since have been declared to be a useless appendage ; and, like all other things for which a better substitute has been found, known only to those who are fond of antiquities. This mark meant a small fee. But there are seals, Sir, as large as a sixpenny pork pie, made with coloured wax and enclosed in an old-fashioned tinder box, for which fees of a fabulous amount are paid. Sir, you should bow you head before this sign of the majesty of the law, and no more dare to question its utility than you would dare to question the existence of old horny with the cloven foot, and whose tail stands out behind. I here are men who will tell you if that seal were destroyed the law would lose its dignity ; it represents the majesty of the law. Oh, you do not mean it, for it is wax, and so plastic that it will take any impression. You mean that it represents a large fee, and surely you are not < ne of those low fellows who say that the dignity of the law means large fees for little labour. If so, pshaw ! I am shocked at you ! a low grumbling rascal. But suppose these fees oftener come from poverty than from wealth, and never from crime, do you not think it is a shame that poverty should have such burdens imposed upon it? No, I think it is of more consequence that the dignity of the law should be maintained, even though poverty should starve and moan. If you are a true lover of your country you will tender to those fees which are the most useless the most reverence, for when reverence is gone what is to support them?"], [473, "A SUMMONS. 465 When Mr. Goader had this important missive put in his hand he lifted up bis eyes wiih astonishment, and said, \" Who has done this?\" He then swayed his body from side to side of his desk. \" I his is very awkward, very.\" I hen raising his shoulders with a shrug, said, \" You must meet this \" I he Jew burst out with great alarm. \"Mine God.

Kxcise penalties are conceived in the spirit of reveng- and not of justice ; in many they tempt the malicious man to become an informer by giving him half the penalty. They do more, they consider the informed against guilty as soon as the information is laid, and, contrary to the genius of the laws, he h;is to make out his own innocence. You must expect to be pursued with the greatest rigour ; your crime is considered a crime against the king, and for all crimes against the king there is no mercy So strictly is the law guarded that a humane magistrate has no power of mitigatii n. It was the knowledge of this which made me so firmly object against your making any confessions when under examination I had no idea that you would have been asked for the permit.

Where there is a hole in which a toad can lie in wait for his prey, there does a toad sit and watch.\" \" 0 no, no I \" said Mr. Goader, \" you are too severe ; they do it from patriotic motives. Of what use would be the laws, if there were not some one to enforce their provisions? The criminal does not like the law when he is suffering from its penalties, and therefore decries it ; but when he requires its help he flies to it as readily as any one. There are none in my profession, I hope, but what are useful members of society.\" \" O yes, yes ! \" said the Jew, in his wildest passion ;\" the devil is a useful member of society, for he scares away many an one from sin.\" \" Hush, hush, you must be calm, or I cannot advise you ; you must be reasonable, or I cannot listen to you ; and, more than all, I cannot and will not stand by and hear my profession abused. All callings have black sheep among them ; the calling is not therefore to be con demned. It is the part of a child to condemn the whole orchard because the first apple gathered is rotten to the core. No, no ; take a more generous and true view of life. The majority of men are honest and upright; it is wrong to condemn the whole for the sins of one. A black swan is sometimes seen, it is not therefore true that swans are black. Learn to distinguish the sins you meet with, which are always the exceptions, from the virtues which are the rule, and be sure you speak of men as you find them. We could not live in the world if vice were the rule. The field would afford no sustenance if all its productions were poisons, and society could not be if all its members were cheats. Let not your passion make you violent and indiscriminate.\" \" O yes, yes ! Mr. Goader, you can preach ; but what is preaching to do for me?

You did not, when a boy, aspire to be rich, as I did ; or, when you grew up to manhood, saw the fruition of your aspirations, as I have ; and every evening looked upon your golden store, and gloated upon the success which had crowned your way of life. Y'ou have not sinned that you might gain, as I have sinned. Y'ou have not dared to be wicked that you might be wealthy, as I have. And now, oh mine God ! the fleshpots for which 1 have longed are going from me \u2014 the riches for wbich I have sinned are flying away ; but the sin will remain with me until the day comes we shall all be punished. Oh mine God, mine God ! let vengeance fall upon some other head ! lay not upon mine more than I can bear.\" \" Shame, shame,\" said Mr. Goader. \"You are not in a condition to take a true view of your position ; until you are, you had better be silent.

This is not a matter to be met with passion or temper of any kind. It must be met with common sense. Let me say more: if the various quarrels and separate interests my profession has to arrange were met with ordinary common sense, instead of passion and alarm, it would be worse for us and better for the litigants. It is too often the case that one thinks the opposite of that which his opponent desires may serve himself, and therefore puts in a blind opposi tion, often more prejudicial to his own interests than to those of his opponent. We know this, and use it in the conduct of our business. Now, now ; do not break out again. Let me advise you to see me again in three days from this ; you will be calmer then ; but you had better be prepared with the fine, for I think you will have to pay it. Now, now; be silent. Good morning; good morning. You may rely upon it I will do my best ; but, good morning; good morning.\" The Jew had almost to be forced to leave the office. He was rather heated than cooled by the consultation he had had. \" Confound the fellow !\" said Mr. Goader; \"what does all this mean ? I do not like these sudden outbreaks of temper. Is he a chicken-hearted miser, or is it really the case that the few losses he has sustained are making an inroad upon his wealth greater than it will bear? Does he not deserve the reputation for riches he has acquired ? Let me see; Jet me see. By my faith, I fear that is the true reason. W here is his account ? I must be paid ; I must have some money from him. If he is really becoming poor, I must be paid. Let me see ; let me see. I have lent him some money upon his note; where is it? it must be coming due. Let me see. O, ay ; I put it in the draw here, with his other papers. Ah ! here it is, for five hundred pounds. It will be due in a foitnight. What ! is it true that this penalty of two hundred pounds will ruin him? 'then how can he pay me the five hundred. O I must get further security. I must get further security, or I must have my money. Let me see ; how shall I manage it ? I must be pressed. How shall I do it ? I must have my money somehow ; how shall I do it ?

They will not believe he is only frightened, and they will all want their money. Every one will try to be first, and without knowing or thinking what they are doing, will break the man up. I must secure myself before the storm is raised which shall make shipwreck of this frightened Jew ; but how shall I do it ? Let me see. I must be pressed. I must get my money or further security. Confound the fellow! what shall I do? I had no idea but he was a man of great wealth. He has deceived me. What a tool I have been ; I ought to have known better. O I must send for him. I must have him here. Let me see ; wlmt shall I do? Confound it! Iain almost in as great a state of alarm as he is, and perhaps nothing but my own fears after all ; but it is better to be safe. I must have my money, or he must give me security. I shall be foolish indeed, knowing what I know, to lose my money. I will let two days pass over, and then I will have security, or my money. I must frighten him, and when under the influence of fear, make him yield to my desires I must throw b^andness on one side, and treat him with professional roughness Be it how it may, I must have my money or security ' The tables were about to be turned upon the Jew He who had heretofore oppressed others was about to be oppressed himself. He who had only seen the civil and bland side of the lawyer's character was about to see the reverse. Hard, harsh, uncivil, unfeeling, unrelenting, and unforgiving, presenting the horrors of the law, and showing the character of a scoryion, rather than that of a man. If it has ever been your misforiune to see the two sides of a lawyer's character you know what it means; if not, you cannot conceive it. Ihe one is agreeable, insinuating, and crawling; the other is fierce, implacable, stern, unforgiving, and revengeful. I herefore has it been fabled, that on one side he has the god-like form of Apollo; on the other, a figure as revolting as the wildest imagination can conceive \u2014 a gorgon, which turns the beholder to stone. Why should it be so? He might be always a man, and yet do his duty to his client.

Mr. Blunt was in his chair, as usual, at tbe Eagle and Ball, delivering his opinion upon men and things, 'she proceedings of the men in the neighbourhood were reviewed with as much anxiety as if they affected the welfare of many instead of that of a few. Had the interests of a nation been in jeopardy more anxiety could not have been felt ; nay, it has been tbe case that men who had the welfare of a nation under control, at a period, too, when the impressions made lasted for generations, treated them with les3 anxiety and more humour than Mr. Blunt was capable of. The losses which had been made, as disclosed by the proofs in Mr. Mincher's bankruptcy, were examined, and specu lations entered into as to how the different parties could bear them ; some of tbe company sighed and grieved over them, others treated them as jokes, and Mr. Blunt told a humorous anecdote as to how a cannie Scotsman met his losses. The Scotsman had sent out his traveller to collect his accounts ; the traveller on his return gave in his statement of all wbo had paid, and handed over the money wbich he had not remitted ; there then came under review those he could not collect. \" Wall,\" said the tradesman, \"an' what aboot Michael Sanderson?\" \" 0, he's a bad chiel as ony as dwals north o' th' Tweed ; he's jerked us a'; he is nae worth a button; there's naething at a' forbye his-carked body.\" \" Is there naething?\" \" Nae ane scurry, it's just a' clane gane \" \" Never mind, he'll gang to the de'il.

Now let us gang to business, it's ill crying aboot shed milk, better gang to the beastie for mair.\" \" Now, that is what 1 call good philosophy,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" When you have made a bad debt send your deblor to the you know where ; then go to work and get some more money ; to try to get bad debts is unprofitable work; leave them and forget them. Having sent your debtors to a warm place, leave them and attend to your business, so that more money may be made to replace that which has been lost.\" \" That is all very well for you to say,\" said John Spratt, \" who have a settled income which comes to you whether asleep or awake ; but is not so well for us who may any day be encumbered with losses, which may take us years to recover. You, like others, may deliver your wit and wisdom cooly enough, when you have no need for it ; but let the day of trial come, and losses will fill you with consternation as well as any of us. We laugh at the flounderings of a struggling swimmer, but when in the death struggle ourselves we have no jocularity.\" \"Ay, ay, that is all very fine; what did you think of the Jew ? I think he stood his examination well.\" \" Talking of him,\" said a jeweller, \"he has been collecting a stock of most costly goods for a Turkish merchant to choose from ; he is going to pay cash down for all that is selected. The Sultan of Turkey is about to make presents of the most costly kind to the ladies of his harem. Mr. Levy expects very large orders from his buyer; as usual, he has sent round to all of us to mark our prices in plain figures, but as it will be a commission order we are to put on twenty per cent, for him. Leave him alone, he knows how to do it ; what with the twenty per cent, we put on, and the commission be will get beside, be will make a good thing of it. These foreign merchants think they buy at the best hand, but they little think that a message is sent to all they will call upon to charge an extra price.\" \" Ay, ay,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" that is the way to do it; but do you tradesmen think it right to help in a deception of that sort ? Are not you acting a falsehood if you do not speak one ?\" \" What are we to do ? We must live.

We, unfortunately, have to trade h\"uv we can, and not how we would. It is an easy thing to introduce morality into trade when you have so many orders on the book that you cannot take more, but not so easy when you have not an order there. It is very easy to be virtuous when there is no temptation to sin, but not so easy when you cannot live unless by treading upon its confines. Men like you, Mr Blunt, who are above ihe world and its ways, may preach, but if you were call'd upon to act, you would do many things which in theory you condemn \" \" Ay, ay,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" all very fine; but who has seen the Jew lately, and what sort of a man is this Turkish merchant?\" None of them had seen loin, but several had heard of him. \" Who is that ?\" said Mr. Mucus, the appraiser and auctioneer. \" Is it Mr. Levy you are talxing about? I, yesterday, valued the whole of his f'uiniiure and stock to Louis Joel, and saw it paid for.\" \" Valued the whole of his stock and saw it paid for!\" said Mr. Blunt, with surprise; \" what does that mean ? Selling his furniture and trade, and ordering large quantities of jewellery. What does that mean? Mr Layton have you been paid for the goods this Turkish merchant has had off you?\" \" No ; I am to be paid for those selecled; the remainder of the stock will be returned, and that will be to-morrow.\" \" To-morrow !\" said the auctioneer, \" he is to appear to an excise summons to-moi row.\" \" O,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" I see how it is, he will mizzle. To-morrow he will be on his way to Jerusalem, and all you on your way to Jericho ; he will not meet it, he'll mizzle.\" Mr. Layton was the man who had brought the information about the large orders which the Jew had to execute, and, upon the strensih of ihe profits he would make, had indulged in a glass or two extra \u2014 not much, he was just comfortable. He arose from bis seat to discuss the point with Mr. Blunt; as he did so, he made several circuitous advances. He had his pipe in his left hand, and after making several advances and retreats in a curvilinear manner, steadied himself with. his right hand upon the table, and said, \"Mr. Blunt, I think as how you are mistaken.

Do you call me a fool, Mr. Blunt, or any other genile man ?\" As he said this he turned round to see if any one would accept his challenge, but they all looked at him silently, the only observable change was that they were more silent and smoked more fiercely. \" No,\" said Mr. Blunt, who had sufficient experience to know when a man was becoming quarrelsome ; \u2014 ''No, I have always found you a good, sensible tradesman.\" \" Very well, then, shake hands. I say as how he ain't a going to mizzle; there now.\" I here is many a man in his sober senses, and whom the world thinks shrewd, who acts upon the principle Mr. Layton did \u2014 compare all opinions with his own, and will crush out by force, if need be, those which are in"], [482, "474 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. opposition. Nay all quarrels, great and small, have more of the person in them than the truth, and may be reduced to the coarse but expressive interrogatory \u2014 \" One of us is a fool ; do vou mean to say it's me ?\" Sometimes a man's living depends upon maintaining his superiority ; sometimes his station in the world ; but in no case need it be fought out with desperation. There is a time he may retire with discreet silence, and not suffer in dignity with his fellow men ; but, alas ! self-esteem blinds as much as drink does, and the contest is continued when there is nothing but self-esteem to contend for. The power of the church when tbe church was all-powerful, said, \" The earth did not move;\" but the earth, like a wretched aud miserable heretic, moved on as if it did uot know that a few insects on its back in the pride of ignorance bad forbidden it to stir. What is a man and his opinions ? Everything to the man, but nothing to the world ; a mere cork upon the flood which he thinks he rides and rules At this point, Mr. Twittles entered the parlour. \"Mr. Twittles,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" they say the Jew has mizzled.\" Upon this Mr. Layton turned round, and said, \" Silence ! I say ; silence ! Hear me, I say ; hear me ! I know what I am about ; hear me, will you? I think I know what I am saying; 1 challenge any man in the company, either Mr. Bluut, or Mr. Twittles, or anybody else, to say whether I know what I am say- ing or not. Silence ! I say ; silence ! \" for murmurs and other signs of insubordination arose, \" hear what I have to say. I say the Jew won't mizzle \u2014 has not mizzled \u2014 and is not going to mizzle.\" \" How do you know, Mr. Layton ?\" said Mr. Twittles. \" How do I know ? Why this is how I know. Hasn't he got a Turkish merchant to trade with ? Hasn't he sent for all our stocks to select from ? Did not he send round to all of us to put an extra commission on our goods ? Well, then, if he was going to mizzle, would he do that ? Don't tell me. I know what I know. Do you mean to say he would take all this trouble for that? if so, I mean to say no.\" \"Well, well,\" said Mr. Twittles ; \" I should like some better evidence than that. What you say is no evidence of anything but your belief.\" \" Well, and isn't my belief as good as any man's?\" \"0 yes, and a great deal better,\" said Jack Spratt. \" Very well, then.\" \" Mr. Louis Joel has bought his goods and stock-in-trade,\" said Mr. Blunt ;"], [483, "475 DECAMPING. \" and upon the valuation of Mr. Mucus who also saw the money he had valued it at paid to Mr. Levy. We hear that there is an excise information out against him, which he has to attend to to morrow.\" \"Yes.\" said Mr. Mucus, \"I know the expected dividend in bankruptcy was estimated to be five shillings in the pound, and Louis Joel, bought it at that price.\" \"There is something serious about to happen. I must go and enquire.\" Mr. Twittles was not satisfied with Mr. Layton's mode of reason ing, but went at once to Mr. Levy's residence to ask for him, and found that it was all true. Mr. Joel had bought his trade and his furniture, and all his outstanding debts. The Turkish mer chant could not be heard of, nor the stock from which the selections were to have been made. As soon as Mr. Layton discovered that he was wrong he became silent, as men like him always do. No matter in what country or in what age, the conduct of man and the works of nature are uniform \u2014 her laws, whether of matter or of mind act without variation. What can have greater mobility than vapour \u2014 thin, airy, mobile and intangible vapour, which floats away into the sky as a thing of naught. Yet it is the stuff of which clouds are made. Look with me at this picture of sunset which was painted by Claude Lorraine two hundred years ago ; there are figures dancing iu the foreground, or rather apologies for figures ; but look at the picture ; do you not see the same evening sunset you see now ? The cattle are preparing for rest, the sun is leaving the sky once again, a pensiveness is falling upon all as it does now, and silence (if silence, wbich is a negative of sound, can be said to) is about to brood over all things. The pipe and the tabor which lead the dance seem more musical than they oid at mid-day, and the thin, airy vapour which forms those far distant clouds are shaped and fashioned as are those which are now waning in the western sky. They rise there, float there, and fade there, not as things of chance, but as intelligent beings, obeying in all their varied changes unchangeable laws. The prim rose grew upon the bank when spring came laughing from the south then as now ; the cowslip reared its modest beauty in the meadows, and was spotted with tiny red spots then as now ; even that fragile thing the antila of the butterfly curled itself in con volutions or stretched itself out in its length that it might feel"], [484, "476 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. where the honey grows and sip from the willing flower the nectar on which it lives. The insect of the day was then the insect of the hour, and everything that is pretty spread its beauty then as now. Our fathers looked upon the starry night and saw the stars we see; they mused in the summer's eve, and saw all that we see \u2014 the dancing insects and the many coloured moths ; they heard the drone of the beetle and the song of the thrush ; they saw the crimson-fringed daisy close its eye of gold, and when the dews fell the flowers gave their perfume to them as to us, and shall do to our children when we lie under the green turf wliich covers our fathers. There are among the ruins which have been brought to this land of those ancient cities of the old times and the old world, when, as tradition says, ''there were giants in those days,\" carvings which represent men in battle and men in domestic and sylvan scenes; among them are carvings of the lotus, the honeysuckle, and bee, as we see them now, and though ages upon ages have passed, and though the insects, the flowers, and the clouds are but fragile things, as they were in those far away times, so are they now. Look with me at this mummy \u2014 the corpse which the embalming arts of the ancients have preserved entire to this day. The man whose body lies here lived iu the times when Cheops was king and tyrant. Look at the corpse \u2014 this man might be own brother to his countryman, who now sweeps the crossing by which we enter the building iu which these treasures are contained. Think you that that fragile antila of the butterfly could have been perpetuated from sire to son through all these ages; think you that the tender flowers would have greeted the spring with the same colours, the same perfumes, the same spots, the same serrated edges, and the same forms, for so long a time that what we call aniiquity seems but as yesterday in those long ages ; think you that those mobile vapours of which the clouds are made, would have taken the same varying but stable forms, unless those laws were eternal ? And when man, groping in the dark, fancies that he has discovered that nature has become effete, and that her laws do sometimes fail, is it not more likely that man is in ignorance than nature in imbecility ?"], [485, "477 THE PUBLIC OFFICE. CHAPTER LXV. THE PUBLIC OFFICE. The day came on which the case was to be heard for which the summons had been issued. In the meantime the intelligence had passed from street to street, from house to house, and from man to mau, that the Jew had disappeared, no one knew where, and no one knew how. He had obtained many valuable goods, and nearly ruined the tradesmen from whom he had obtained them. If any of his fellow countrymen knew where be was gone they would not say so \u2014 there was not even so much as a rumour of the way he had taken; all was a blank, excepting tbat he was gone. Mr. Goader had eagerly sought a trace, and had examined everything which seemed like a trace, but all in vain. With his professional coolness he had looked over the transfer of his trade, debts, and property. All was legally correct. The purchaser probably knew the intention of the sale; indeed, certainly knew the intention, but all bad been done according to the forms of law ; the law would not, therefore, call it in question. '1 he transaction was against the spirit of all law, human and divine ; but it was true in form, and therefore not to be set aside. Mr. Goader saw the Jew had used lawyers' tools, and that it was useless to question the woikmanship ; he, therefore, was discreetly silent as to the particulars of his own loss, and, as far as he said anything, it was only to make such remarks as might apply to any case as well as that. He expressed a general opinion, and gave no grounds for it, for it was an axiom with him, \" that the opinion may be right, but the reasoning upon which that opinion is founded good for nothing.\" The magistrates in those days were all of them unpaid ; among them was an unsuccessful barrister. When any case which con-"], [486, "478 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. cerned the ruling power of the land was to be heard, be was sure to be upon the bench. There are but few men who can tell the motives which influence others, yet all men said he sat there with the hope that the government he was so anxious to serve would some day reward his subserviency. If so, he was deceived, for he left this town in dudgeon and died an unrewarded man. The day Mr. Levy's case was to be heard be sat upon the bench. At that time the bench was a wide watchman's box capable of holding four in comfort. Along the top of the half-door was a desk and writing materials ; on the top of the box there was a crown mounted upon a cushion, the colour of both much faded, and the gold much tarnished. Near them was placed a sword and a pair of scales ; the sword was in its sheath, and I question if it had ever been drawn therefrom, or if it could be withdrawn without tearing the scabbard, it was so rusty. The scales were out of balance, they preponderated on the sinister side. All were very dirty, and festooned with cobwebs as much as are the way side branches in an autumn morning. At the front of the bench was a square table and seats upon the four sides, upon which the Magistrates' clerks and attorneys who were engaged, or expected to be engaged, sat. Facing the magistrates were some thirty or forty members of that many-headed body called the public. Were you ever sufficiently curious to study the faces and heads of the people any particular cause assembles, not merely in a court of justice, but anywhere where they are assembled ? Have you observed that the few persons whom a discourse upon a scientific subject attracts have heads and faces of a very high order, and that those who attend a prize-fight have scarcely any other expressions than animal ones ? Did you, when making this study, come to the conclusion that crime and poverty and imbe cility were all separate types of low mental organizations ? Whether you did or not, the persons assembled before the magistrates, when Mr. Levy's case came on, were of the type which characterises crime and brutality. As I entered the court, there was before the magistrates a poor imbecile. He was in rags ; he did not seem to have been washed for days and days ; his hair had been for months uncombed, aud the saliva streamed from his mouth. He stared about the court and did not seem to know what it meant. I observed that his right leg was"], [487, "THE PUBLIC OFFICE. 479 tucked at tbe ancle, and that he walked upon his toe; that his right arm was tucked at the wrist. Poor fellow ! he had been the sport of idle, thoughtless boys, and had upon his person the marks of ill-usage. I should have thought that his poor, bereaved state would have made him an object of pity, and not of jibes and jests; but it was not so. It came out in the evidence that the poor boy was the son of a wanton. She had been tempted to sin, and when her sin had become known, her parents harshly drove her from their door. Her sister women turned their backs upon her, and, though she sorrowed as one without hope, yet the world would not allow her sorrows to atone for her crime. But she was of the world and iu the world, and must live. Ah ! who can tell what bitter pangs are felt by those whom the world discards, and who, at the same time know that in one unguarded hour, the tempter came, and with fond endear ments wrought their ruin? Who can tell that when all hope is gone what misery it is which becomes the companion of the wretched? O ye thoughtless \u2014 who have never shed a tear for human sorrow, who have nothing but stern frowns for sorrow whose source is sin, who have never expressed one word of sympathy for the wretched and broken-hearted \u2014 learn the history of one then. If you have nothing but harshness for her, ye are not made of the stuff the angels are. If He who makes the record of our actions in the great book of life grieves when siu has to be entered, and drops a tear of pity for human woe, will look upon tbe fallen one with gentleness and intercede with the great Judge, as he did for the Magdalene of old, who are you and of what spirit are you who never forgive ? Do you think the Master of us all does not know what is right? Do you think He does not know how to measure the punishment which is due to the crime ? Then take not upon you His prerogatives, but leave the lost one to Him. He will be infinitely more merciful than you. It appeared that when the poor mother of this idiot boy was cast upon the world she could find no sympathy from any but erring sisters, therefore, when she was driven from home there was no course open but tbe one upon wbich she had entered. Through all her perils and sufferings she clung to her child fondly, 0 how fondly ! When it lay upon her lap, she would"], [488, "480 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. look upwards and pray, as the tears rolled down her face, that if our Father required a punishment for her sins, that punishment miu'ht fall upon her, and not upon her poor idiot boy. He could not help it, and why should be be punished? As he grew in years she clung to him as the one thing for which to live; for, had it not been a second and a greater crime to die, she would have hurried herself ir.to judgment. They were as all the world to each other; the boy loved none but his mother, and his mother loved none but her boy. But she sickened and died, and left her poor simple one to the cares of a world which had no care for him. Ihe poor boy did not seem to comprehend the idea of death. He thought his mother slept. When she had been dead a day and night, he gently shook her and said \" Mammy, mammy, wake.\" When they put her in the coffin he fought them and said they should \"not put bis mammy in a box.\" Poor fellow, he knew not that she was dead, nor did he know what death was ; he thought she only slept. When they laid her in the grave he cried for his mammy. They had to put him under restraint ; but at night he stole away, and by the morning he had with his hands and nails dug the grave open again, and was found knocking upon the coffin calling his \"mammy. ' Poor fellow, his mammy was gone and he was left desolate and alone. It was for the attempt to unearth his mammy he was brought before the magistrates. He looked at the state, the pomp, and the ceremony of the court bewildered. All was strange, passing strange to him ; like a dream ; consistencies and inconsistencies were so mingled that all was a puzzling dream. He said, \" 1 want my mammy ; give me my mammy ; she is only asleep ; give me my mammy. They put her in a box and threw dirt on her. It's my mammy, my mammy ; let me go to my mammv ; sbe is awake now; let me go \" He then raised his voice and cried aloud, until the court house and its corridors echoed his cries, \" Mammy, mammy, come to me!\" Poor fellow, he thought that if his \" mammy \" could hear him, she would come to him. And so she would ; for sinner as sbe was she had so much of the woman left that she would brave all dangers to protect her poor idiot boy. But, alas ! she was dead ; dead to her friends ; nay, not to her friends \u2014 to her relations \u2014 for friends she had none.

The voice of her child could not reach her there ; and, poor fellow, he had the penalty to bear for sins he did not commit. \"What is your name?\" said the magistrates' clerk. \"I want my mammy; let me go to my mammy.\" \" What is your name ? Tell me what is your name first.\" But he merely repeated, \" I want my mammy.\" The magistrate turned to the police and said, \"Do you know his name?\" They did not. \" It is very strange,\" said the barrister magistrate, \" tbat you do not know the name of a character like this; you must be more vigilant. t\\ e cannot have the course of justice stopped by your inattention.\" The other magistrate had been moved by the con- duct of the poor idiot, and thought that kindness was a readier way to the heart of a simple one even, than sternness, and said, \"Mj poor fellow, what was your mammy's name?\" But he replied, \" My mammy.\" \"And what is your name ? \" \"Billy,\" said he. \" But what other name than Billy.\" He did not know any other name than Billy. \" Does any one in the court know anything about him ? \" Upon this one of the public said that he knew him as \" Silly Billy \" only ; and then he narrated the story as I have told it ; and as no better information could be obtained, an order was made that he should be taken to the parish workhouse. Poor fellow ! as he was removed he looked round the court with a vacant stare, as if he expected to find his \"mammy\" there. \"Poor fellow,\" thought I, \"I wish I were a philosopher for thy sake. I would investigate the cause of thy deficiency ; why it was that the laws of nature in thy case went astray, and produced an idiot, and not a man ; how much, if any, was sin, and how much of the mind's agony \u2014 of the mental sorrows\u2014 of thy mother which bore thee, it was, wbich deprived thee of thy wits. If I were a divine I would seek an answer to the questions : Do such as thee go to tbe realms of bliss, and, when there, wander about those blessed regions as witless as ye wandered about this world ? Will thy mother meet thee there, and be the friend to thee she was here ? The great Judge is more merciful than I. I could not shut thee out from heaven for thy mother's sin; and, like Him, I would grieve for the Magdalene, but forgive her; and if thy idiotcy were a punishment for her sin, I would forgive thee too.\" Q"], [490, "482 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. When the excise case came on, the clerk said in a sleepy matter of-course sort of tone and manner, looking at his papers at the same time, \" Call the defendant.\" He then put some papers before tbe Magistrates upon the desk over his head. Tbe barrister Magistrate took them iu his band, and with tbe aid of a glass wbich was suspended by a black ribbon around his neck, began to read them. The Clerk then looked at the man at the door. He, understanding this telegraphy, began calling \" Emanuel Levy ; \" one of the audience said, \" there is no use calling him, he has run away.\" rl he barrister Magistrate looked at him sternly. The Crier of the Court fiercely shouted \" silence !\" Tbe man who had given the information was snuffed out. I was young in those days, and simple enough to believe that tbe truth always received a welcome in a court of justice ; that it did not matter whether it came in by the door, or the window, or the dock ; it was the truth that was wanted there, and it did not matter how it came ; but I have since learned that truth may go in, but if so, it must be in form, and that it will receive no welcome whatever unless there be a fee in its hand. For any one to tell the truth, as this volunteer did, and stop the making of fees, is folly. He will receive a rebuff, if not a com mittal. There will be sure to be no attention paid to him. They want to go through as many forms as they can, because every form means a fee. The fee must be paid by somebody, and if there is nobody to pay, tbe county must do it. If you go to any court for redress, you must dip your hand into your pocket before you can have any attention paid to you. Let that be a settled article of your creed, which must not be violated. If you do violate it, you will be anathematised, and have every one about you, from the biggest wig to the veriest cur. It is a matter that wants reforming altogether, but whoever attempts it will be rewarded by a martyr's crown, or, in common par lance, \" with more kicks than ha'pence.\" \" Call the defendant,\" said the Clerk, and the Crier called \" Emanuel Levy \" in the Court, and \"Emanuel Levy\" was shouted in the corridors; \" Emanuel Levy \" was shouted from corridor to corridor, and through every precinct, and over the yard of the court-house, but by the time it bad got so far it was not \" Emanuel Levy \" that was shouted ; Emanuel Levy had undergone many variations"], [491, "THE PUBLIC OFFICE. 483 before then \u2014 then it* was \"A Manly Levy,\" to which a wag added \" at two shillings and sixpence in the pound by way of economy.\" \"Silence,\" said another wag, \"you are insulting the authorities.\" Although \" Emanuel Levy \" was called so frequently and so loudly there was no reply, so the Clerk began writing that down. The proceedings in bankruptcy were then put in evidence, and several merely formal matters were gone through. A conviction was obtained. It was ordered that the fine of two hundred pounds should be paid in twenty-four hours, or tbat a distraint be made upon his goods and chattels. Thus, then, meaningless forms were gone through, many fees were made, and the man who should have paid them was gone no one knew where. I thought it the height of folly to convict a man who would never return to receive the penalty. \\\\ ben I entered the door of the court-house, I saw several dirty-looking people standing about ; some of them with dis figured faces, others marked with the marks of present and former disease, most of them emaciated by poverty and excesses, and all of them had an idle \" devil-may-care, for I don't,\" ap pearance. A poor woman was among them, crying; ber son had committed some petty theft, and he was that morning to be examined. She was in great grief ; it was very plain that she was a straDger to such scenes ; she was willing to receive information from the \" old hands \" about her, and, simple like, told her sorrows to hardened sinners who had no care for them ; she would take any course which would restore her son to liberty. It might be the wiser course for her son to be punished for the crime he had committed ; but he was her son, aud when her child is in trouble what mother is wise ? As she stood, sur rounded by the idlers to whom she was telling her sorrows, a young man, a little cleaner than the others, forced bis way into the group of which the poor woman was the centre, and took great compassion upon her. He inquired what her son was \"up for,\" and who it was who had made the charge. When he had heard her story, he said, \" O, he is a bad one, he is a pretty fellow to have your son up, he is always having somebody up ; he brings false charges continually ; he wants punishing him- self, bringing the children of respectable people here upon such frivolous pretences ; he'll have it some day ; there will be an"], [492, "484 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. action for false imprisonment, and serve hitn right.\" The poor woman thought the speaker a very nice gentleman ; she asked him if he would speak up for her child. He said, \" Come along with me.\" She did not know the man ; though advanced in years she was young in the ways of such a place ; he had spoken the words of kindness and comfort ; sbe thought him a good, kind-hearted, and well-disposed gentleman. Had she known more of the world, she would have known he was only a \"touter\" to a low lawyer; but she was simple, and did not believe that he who had spoken so kindly to her, only wanted to trade upon her sorrows. He took her to the lawyer for whom he was touting, and told him her story. \" Ah ! \" said he, in an off-hand, contemptuous way, \" he is a pretty fellow to be bring- ing people before the Court; he wants bringing himself; I'll make him rue some of these times ; and such a witness too ! How does he know but the witness is the thief, and swears against your child to save himself? I can see a flaw in the in- dictment which will save him.\" The poor woman began to cheer up, and as she was ready to believe her son was innocent, she did do so. \" Could you save him ?\" said she. \" I can ; if you tell me true, I can.\" \" Will you, my good gentleman, be so kind as to try ? \" said she imploringly. \" I am very busy,\" said he, \"and my time is valuable; my fee will be a guinea.\" The poor woman began to cry again. She had not a guinea in the world, and she said so. \" I have ten shillings, which I have scraped together to pay my rent, for the landlord threatened to send the ' bailies ' if I do not.\" \" Well, give me that,\" said he. She gave it him, and he took the money from the poor woman, though at the same time he well knew he could do nothing for her son. The world called him a gentleman ; but if such be the conduct of a gentleman, what must be the conduct of him the world calls a vagabond ?"], [493, "485 THE BILL. CHAPTER LXVI. THE BILL. When the second meeting in bankruptcy was held the wire drawer was there, he went with the intention of being crafty as well as fierce, but when there he found no creditor but himself. The Commissioners were listlessly twisting their pens in their hands, gaping and talking ; during the time they were gaping they were going heedlessly through the required forms \u2014 like men who cared not for them, but would be glad when they were com pleted and done with. As he entered they merely gave him a sidelong look and took no further notice of his presence. \"Goader,\" said the Chairman, \"you put in that, do you?\" \"Does your Honour object?\" said Mr. Goader. \"O no, I merely said, you put in that, that is all.\" \" I have to ask your Honour,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \"for a cash account for the last twelve months?\" \"Goader,\" said the Chairman, \"do you object?\" \"No,\" said Mr. Goader, \"no, upon condition it is paid for out of the estate.\" \" What sort of an estate will it be ? Let me see; Sticker is assignee. W\"hat say you? are there funds?\" \"There are, your Honours,\" said Mr. Sticker. \"Will it be a good estate ?\" said the Commissioners. Upon the question being put, Mr. Sticker had one of his violent fits of coughing, so violent that it was surprising he did not break a blood vessel, or do himself some other serious injury. \" Hot water,\" said he, \" hot water.\" The hot water was brought, and having drunk a cup steaming hot, the paroxysm was allayed. \" Did you ever trv the cordial of Rasikiricum mixture with the balsam of Kem kauima for your cough ? You will find it will afford you great relief.\" \" No,\" said Mr. Sticker\u2014\" No ; hot water is the best.\" \"What sort of an estate will this be; a good one?\" again"], [494, "486 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. repeated the Commissioner. \" Thoro will bo enough to pay expenses,\" said Mr. Sticker. \" Very well, then, let the meeting be adjourned for \u2014 will one month suit you ; shall you bo ready in that time?\" \" les,\" said Mr. Goader, with a Long drawl upon tin \"yes.\" \"Then it stands adjourned for one mouth.\" llpon this the Commissioners rose aud turned their backs upon the creditors, or what was imagined to bo the creditors, for the wirc drawer was the only one there. The Chairman said, \"Where shall we dine?\" The wire-drawer was struck with bis dull, heedless, listless, nnd careless manner ; it more than anything convinced him of tho folly of his own proceedings, lie went there with something like the spirit of revenge which he had mistaken lor a desire to sec justice done. 1 lo expected all parlies to be as earnest as himself; ho expected to see liowns of disap probation lowering upon the bankrupt, and condign punishment. awarded for what he called bis crimes, but what n mini of enlarged experience would call bis misfortunes. lie was about to address tbe Court himsell', but was told the Court hud ad journed, lie began lo object against the cureless milliner in which the business was done, but was told that as he had appointed an attorney be could not bo heard.

With bis quick hasty temper he became impatient, mid went to Mr. Sparrow') office to express the doubts he felt. When he arrived, there wns waiting for an interview an old enemy, who, in his opinion, was the very quintessence of roguery, liis enemy gave him a quick under glance, and knowing the wire-drawer's irritable disposition, he began a system of silent chaffing. He scraped bis feet ; he walked backwards and forwards ; he looked at the wire-drawer with n sneering smile ; be hummed a contemptuous tune ; he turned himself round, heaved up his coat tails, and strode ncross the fire-place to nir himself. Indeed, he did all he could to excite the wire-drawer to make some intemperate expression. His actions were meaningless to those who did not know the history of the two men ; and to a stranger would seem only the conduct of a vain man who was upon such first-rate terms with himself that tbe rest of tbe world were as nothing, or at least only as beings made for the express purpose of admiring him. But it was in- tended to irritate the wire-drawer, and he wished be would commit himsell' in some intemperate language, so that the feelings which had been so long pent up might have tin opportunity of revenge. His silent chaffing could not be seen by any but tho wire-drawer, but if tbe wire-drawer burst out in the wild in- temperate language be expected, that could be seen and under- stood by all persons, and all would say bow much in the wrong the wire-drawer was. In this he might have succeeded, if at this stage his turn had not arrived. As he opened the door to cuter Mr. Sparrow's office, be turned round and gave the wire-drawer n full and sneering expression of contempt. Had he had not entered the private room there would have been the explosion he required. As it was, tbe win-drawer found bis old enmity revive in all ils former intensity. When his enemy had occasion to laugh, that enemy laughed loudly and heartily, so that it might, be beard iu the waiting room, for he knew well who the laugh would irritate. V\\ hen his interview wns over he came laughing out, closed tbe door behind him, looked at the wire-drawer, suddenly stopped his laughing, nnd again looked at the wirt drawer, this time witb a frown. His frown was returned. The"], [497, "489 THE BILL. two men looked at each other with settled hatred, and with the full knowledge that a day would come when the quarrel would be fought out to the death. Its immediate effect was to put the wire-drawer into as unfavourable a state of mind as he could be for the interview he was seeking. When his turn arrived, he, therefore, had no very agreeable expression upon his face. Mr. Sparrow looked at him, and with the great knowledge of human nature his profession gave him, saw at once that something had seriously aisturbed his equanimity. But he assumed nothing ; the language he used to him was for the purpose of discovering what had caused the state of mind he saw. Had he seen the chaffing which had taken place in the outer office, he would have known at once, and need not have fished to discover what wa3 the matter. \" Weil,\" said Mr. Sparrow, \" tbe meeting was quiet to-day, very quiet, but yon see we have carried our point. We have got the deldy we required : delay, you know, is our game. We must keep Mincher back. We must keep him in the court. We must weary him. You think he ought to be punished ':\" said Mr. Sparrow, looking firmly in tbe wire-drawer's face, as if tsiat were the key to his state of mind. \" I do,\" said he. \" But, my good man, there are other modes of punishing a man than putting him in prison. Look yon here, when you punish a man it is the mind you must act upon. If you do not act upon that there is no punishment. In imprisonment, the criminal may become fat, and a body wasted by excesses may become healthy by the very reason that it is kept away from excesses, and the good humour and the cheerful feeling of health may take the place of suspicious and guilty fears. Nay, a man's ideas are much influenced by the opinion of his companions. If they think bis imprisonment is a martyrdom, and deserving their admiration, he will think so too. It therefore will be merely restraint, and not punishment. When he returns to his com panions he is welcomed as a hero, and receives a hero's ovations. The healthy vigour of his body is improved by the attention which is given to his health and' the forced avoidance of excesses, and his mind is supported by the thought that his fellows admire his pluck. You may punish a right-feeling man, severely punish him, yet not imprison him. You can so act upon his mind that his\" sufferings shall be great indeed. Unless"], [498, "490 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. you can act upon the mind of the criminal there is no punish ment at all. Vulgar and thoughtless people believe that the stocks, the pillory, a gaol, and transportation, are all the means of punishment. If they act upon the mind they are, but if they do not they are no punishment whatever. In some case3 they are a relief from the excitement of guilt, and a welcome change in life. A twelve months' imprisonment is a twelve months' independency, and relief from the cares of life ; every thing provided \u2014 food, raiment, washing and lodging, medicine, and spiritual comfort, no care from day to day, neither rent, nor levies, nor taxes. How can this be called punishment ? If the mind considers it no punishment it is none, but an advantage, especially during the winter season. I hope you clearly see it is the mind we must punish ; failing to do that there is no punishment at all. Now, Sir, let me tell you we can punish the mind without at all restraining the body ; nay, severely punish it, and it is this kind of punishment upon which, in our case, we must rely. We have to obtain delays day after day, week after week, and month after mouth. If we see him afflicted with the sickness of delayed hope, we must aggravate that sick ness until it, becomes despair. Then is our time to obtain tbe best terms ; then is our day of victory. He will promise any thing, and do anything. We must fix his promise in a legal manner, and when he is cleared of all other difficulties he will have but this one to contend with. Then we shall gain our own.\" During the delivery of this advice he was watching the wire-drawer with the keenest scrutiny, for though he knew his client was fiery and impassioned, be also knew there was a generosity at the bottom of his character, as there is in all passionate men, which, when the temper is restored to equanimity, will assert itself and forgive. \" I bave no idea,\" said the wire drawer, \" of pursuing a man in that way. I shall not follow a speculative game like that. It may win, but how ? Not for me. I have had enough of this. 1 want your bill.\" \" Ho not be hasty,\" said Mr. Sparrow. \" We have not had time for our plan to work. We shall succeed if you will be patient. You do not suppose that experience in my profession has been thrown away upon me, or that I would advise you to a course of action which has not every probability of succeeding.\" \" I am not"], [499, "491 THE BILL. satisfied,\" said the wire-drawer. \" I shall not follow out this course of action. All who have anything to do with these pro ceedings appear to desire only to make money. It is the be-all and the end-all of everything. I want my bill.\" \" My good man,\" said the attorney, \"you have not had the experience I have, or you would see that all is proceeding as well as we can wish it ; if we had the game entirely in our own hands it could not proceed better. Where there is no severity you think there is no punishment ; it is a mistake, Sir, as I have told you, a great mistake ; be patient, and all will be right.\" \" That may, or may not be ; it is not my way of doing business ; I want your bill.\" \" But, my good man,\" said the lawyer, \" you speak as if you had experience in these matters. I can assure you everything is going on as well for us as we can expect. You heard the Commissioner ask if there was money in the estate, and the answer that was given. W'hy did he ask that ? Had he wanted to decide justly he would have asked no such question; he wanted to know if he should be paid for his trouble. You heard there was money in hand ; as long as there is we shall not let it go ; it is the interest of all of us to keep it. Let our opposition be continued until it is the only apparent obstruction to a settlement, then our game is won. There will be no money parted with, except to the officials, until all opposition is removed. Why, it was only the other day that the assignee \u2014 Sticker \u2014 had an estate in hand in which there was a balance of thirteen hundred pounds. An action was commenced against him \u2014 an interpleader case \u2014 and he refused, and very justly refused, to part with any of the money until the action was settled. The Court supported him in that refusal ; let me honestly say they advised him to take care of himself and of themselves ; how much of the thirteen hundred pounds the action might con sume was uncertain, perhaps all of it. The conduct of the Court is like that of the primitive kings in the barbaric times. When the feast was spread the king fed to fulness, then the officers of the court ; and when they were satisfied there was the rush of the multitude to scramble for the scraps, if any ; and a very proper course it was. The dignitaries should be fat and sleek, if the commonalty are scarecrows. Ha! ha! ha ! You see I can be facetious and severe upon my profession.\" This was"], [500, "492 KECOI LECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. said because he saw a lowering expression upon his client's face, which boded no good for his schemes, and he supposed a spin of sarcasm might suit the temper of the moment, for he saw he was losing ground. \" I want my bill,\" said the wire-drawer. \" There is no hurry,\" said the attorney,\" \" I shall not press you for payment ; let it reniaiu until the business is concluded. I do not even ask you for money on account. Never mind the bill.\" \" I must say,\" said the wire-drawer, \" I do not like these proceetliugs.

If you win, you pay yourself by the costs you get ; if you lose, you have nothing : in anv case I am free.\" \"Sir,\" said the attorney, drawing himself up to his full height with iudignation \u2014 \" s-ir. what do you thiuk I am ? do you take me for a mean, low, pettifogging fellow, under the necessity of doing anything for business r Sir, I hope I have too much honour to conduct my business dishonourably. I desire you will not insult me ; my bill shall be sent you iu due course.\" \" I do not know anything about your honour or your dishonour; it is a money question, aud as a money question I mean to treat it.\" The wire-drawer was irritated ; he was not the man to hear such language without a reply ; the tongue with him was truly li an unruly member,\" and often got him into difficulties. \"I must say this, that tbe advice you have given me tray be considered honourable by your profession, ami none of the articles in your code of honour may be violated thereby, but it is a code to which I owe no allegiance aud no reverence; on the contrary, I despise such things.

I must bave your bill ; you will proceed no further in this matter on my account.\" This bold conduct made the lawyer criuge with all his suppleness.

In the morning, Mr. Blunt, portly and jolly, came toddling along the street with a wedding favour upon his left breast, just over bis heart, for as he said, \"It was better to have heart than head in a wedding, for with the heart there would be lasting love though the cupboard were empty, and with the head there would be no love though a fall cupboard ; and life without love is not worth much \u2014 it is that of an animal which works to live and lives to die. When, therefore, you attend a wedding, put the favour over your heart, and hope the love may be under.\" Mr. Blunt went toddling along until he arrived at the Plume of Feathers. He was pleased \u2014 indeed, in tip-top spirits. There were three coaches at the door \u2014 each of them having a pair of white horses, and the horses had wedding favours on each side the head. At the horses' heads were three coachmen in breeches and boots, striped waistcoats, a sharp coatee, like a waistcoat with sleeves, a huntsman's cap on the head, white gloves, and white favours on the breast. Tom came to the door to meet Mr. Blunt, whose approach he had seen through the bulk window. \" Welcome,\" said Tom, \" welcome; I am glad to see ycu on this happy occasion.\" \"Doing it nobby,\" said Mr. Blunt, pointing to the coaches and the coachees : \" white gloves and wedding favours.\" \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" I flatter myself I have come out ; I likes to see a weddin' as is tip-top, as it happens but once in your life, though some on us has it oftener ; you should come out a bit at these happy moments.

The pretty little Peggy was henceforth going to be the pretty Mrs. Tom. Around the table were seated some of Tom's friends, all of them coachmen, and dressed in the best costume they had ; they had combed their hair straight down their foreheads, and put their hats under tbe chairs, like so many spittoons. \" Now, Mr. Blunt,\" said Tom, \" say grace, and let's set to.\" \" But where's the bride ?\" said Mr.Blunt. \" Dash my buttons,\" said Tom, \"if I Indn't like to have forgot her ;\" and he went to the door of the next room where Peggy and her bridesmaids were waiting, and said iu a half-loving, half-coaxing tone, \" Peggy, it's all ready, and we are all awaitin'. Mr. Blunt as well.\" Now, Peggy was a woman and not a finick. There was, as Tom said, \" Not no nonsense about her.\" She neither fainted nor tried to faint. She neither cried nor tried to cry. She did not go into hysterics, nor try to do so. She was truly a woman, and she took her place at the table as if she were a guest, and not the principal figure. Her attire was gay, but exceedingly neat, and though she was very pretty sbe looked much prettier in her decorative neatness. \" Ah, Tom,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" you ought to be happy, for you are going to have a dainty little wife.\" And the company said, \" So he is, Mr. Blunt.\" Upon this a slight blush suffused Peggy's face, and she looked really beautiful \u2014 very beautiful \u2014 when the bride's"], [503, "TOM'S WEDDING. 495 bloom arose. \" Now, Mr. Blunt, say grace,\" said Tom. Mr. Blunt put up his hands and his eyes, and imitating the drone of a conceited parson, said grace, \" ' When the wicked man for saketh the wickedness he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.' Now, as Tom is going to be married, and will hereafter do his wickedness lawfully, let us drink his health and success to the undertaking,\" and they ad of them drunk his health, and they set to to eat the breakfast. \" Mr. Blunt,\" said Tom, \"I never was inside a weddin' afore this, I ali'ays stood at the door, or had the tittles and the beer in the kitchen ; but, do they ali'ays say that grace at a weddin'.\" \"Always, when I have to say it,\" said Mr. Blunt. \"I know,\" said Tom, \"it's the grace they say at church ; leastwise, one on 'um ; but I dain't know, afore this, as how they said the same grace at a weddin' as at a church, but I shall know now.\" \" Here, Peggy, said Mr. Blunt, \" I will send you a nice piece of this fowl.\" \" That's right,\" said Tom, \" Peggv, do as I do, lay in a good foundation ; theu there'll be no grumb.in' o' th' wind, and it ain't pleasant to hear that a rattlin' all day. Lay in a good foundation, leave no room for it, that's what I say, and I know it's a good rule \u2014 lay in a good foundation. I've heard say, Mr. Blunt, that when a man's in love he has a pain in the back, and is dry like, but I say, lay in a good foundation of tittles, and swill it down well, and then there will be summit for love to stand on, and no pans in the back ; vou see our cat goes out night arter night on love expedi tions, without anythin' at all, then comes home thin as a rake, and a back so bad as he can hardly crawl. W hen he's took his tittles, and had a rest, he's better. When you go out again, says I, lav in a good foundation, and don't go so long without your littles. Then yer can stand it. Nothin' like layin' in a good foundation when your goin' a-courtin', or when ye're goin' a marrvin', is there,\" Mr. Blunt? \" \" Tou're right there, Tom,\" said Mr. Blunt, \" a full belly and a full cupboard add very much to a man's ability, and very much improve his notions of life. He is not half \"so likely to see the black side, nor to be a grumbler. Now, Peggy, there's a nice plate of fowl and ham. Here, Tom, hand it over.\" \" Yes, Mr. Blunt, I'll do the perlite.\" \"Pe^gv,\" said Mr. Blunt, \"you will find the merry thought there,"], [504, "496 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and when you have cleaned it, Tom and you shall break it between you, to see which shall be married first. Now, ladies and gentlemen set to,\" and silling himself a glass, he drank the health of the bridesmaids, and hoped he might soon have to preside at their breakfasts. The breakfast proceeded, with various of these bantering interludes. During the time, the servants of the house, and others, stood in the doorway of the room, so many of them, until they made a little mob of it \u2014 the females criticising the bride, her dress, her bearing, indeed, her every action ; and the boys and men wondering and smiling at the whole proceeding. They were all in high delight, for they said \" it was our wedding.\" They, for the most part, spoke of it in a kindly spirit ; but there were some of them drew invidious comparisons. There, as everywhere else, were fault finders, who wanted to pull others down to their own level ; but Mr. Blunt kept the party jolly. Breakfast Over, they prepared for church. When the bride was dressed she was very neat, and very pretty. She wore white shoes, with white silk rosettes; a white muslin dress, neatly trimmed with white silk ribbons; n nankeen spencer, also trim med with white silk ribbons ; a white pearl necklace, a small white straw cottage bonnet, trimmed with orange blossoms and jasmines ; over her shoulders a white lace shawl. A description of Peggy as she looked upon her wedding day may be given in words, as you may describe the plumage of a humming bird, or that of the bird of Paradise, or as you might describe the Queen of the Fairies. But words are all too poor to give a true idea of her neatness and beauty. A picture might have been drawn, but that would but meanly depict her beauty. The mind, the liveliness, the bloom, and the blushes were beyond the painter's art. She was worthy of the noblest in the land ; but she was happier with Tom for her lord than she would have been with the owner of a coronet. The untold joy, which is too full for utterance, was hers. O say not it is only great ones who can greatly feel. The humble village maid can love with as great, perhaps greater passion than a queen ; and he whose horizon was never other than that he can see from his village church, can feel as deeply as him of much larger experience, and whose horizon has been boundless. It is not rank which gives"], [505, "TOM'S WEDDING. 497 the feeling, nor n gilded equipage which mnkes the heart ; but He who adorns the lily with beauty, nnd gives tho perfume to the rose. With Him there is no rank ; all arc equal. The dis tiuc ions of men are not the distinctions of God,' Tom had on a new pair of top boots, drab kerseymere smnlls, n plum-coloured waistcoat, it blue cont with gilt buttons, aud a new beaver hat. He wore white gloves, and he looked tliegen tleiiiaii. It wns astonishing what a difference the tailor made in him. The wedding party seated themselves in their carriages; but us the bride and the bridegroom were entering their separate carriages, some one threw an old shoe ut them, which struck them on the back and rather astonished them, but made the by standers merry. Peggy looked up aud around, nnd wns glad tho situ shone out proudly, for she believed in the, adage \u2014 \" Blessed is the btide whom the sun shines on. And blessed are the dead whom the rain ruins on.\" Tom wanted to ride in the same carriage as Peggy did, but Mr. Blunt would not allow it. lie said it was not right \u2014 it was indecent, A bride aud a bridegroom should not bo iu the same carriage until thev arc man and wife. \"Then you see,\" said he, with one of his roguish leers, \" they may be put into the same Carriage, and have the blinds down; and if the new wife does not say the gentleman is rude, he has no gallantry about him.\" \" Ah,\" said Tom wiping his month, and giving Mr. Blunt a poke ill the ribs, and hitching up bis smnlls us if his braces hud sud dcnlv become too long, \"Ah, my boy. Unit's the time.\" The bystanders seemed lo enjoy the situation much. When they wen- ;ill seated, the coachman started oil' at lull gallop, as if it WI io ;i question of life and denth. They dashed up to the church gates, an\u00abl the horses had to stop themselves wiih a long slide, almost filling upon their haunches. They arranged themselves at the altar. The parson in bis long shirt, as Tom called his while gown, read the service in n fat easy tone, and supplicated tiod in a patronising manner, as if he were intimate with Him, bud sat with lliinnl ninny u dinner purty, therefore wns upon terms ol great intimaoy with Him, mid knew perfectly well who Ho would save and who He would condemn. A correct observer could see that ho thought more of himself, and"], [506, "498 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. what people would think cf him, than of the Being whose blessing his sing-song language was supplicating. When the ring was wanted, he said, \" Where is the ring? \" Tom held out his hand to Peggy, and Peggy began fumbling in her pocket for it. Tom said to the parson in a very confidential whisper, \" Yer see, Sir, when we are married I means to make her take care of all tbe money and all the valuables. I thinks as how a woman can do it so much better than a man ; so I begun by giving her the ring to lake care on. Here it is, Sir.\" \" No, no,\" said the parson, smi'ing, \"keep it.\" So Tom was going to put it in his pocket, but Mr. Blunt corrected his mistake, and Tom said, \"O, that's it? Ah, to be sure, so it is.\" Pray, Sir, are you married? If so, you need not laugh at this contretemps, because you were very near doing the same yourself. How to handle that bit of gold at that interesting moment I know was a puzzle, and you had to be told how to do it. Now it is no use your saying you were not ; I know you were ; I ask your wife. Now was not he? There, now, you bear what she says. If you are not married wait until your turn comes, and then if you are not embarrassed laugh at Tom. The ceremony over, and the book signed, Tom turned to Mr. Blunt, and said, \"Now may 1?\" \" To be sure you may ; she is your property now.\" Here, according to the way in which great weddings like Tom's are described, there should be a bit of poetry introduced about the enchantments entrancements, happiments, and all other ments which are qualities of kisses ; but you can conceive of that according to your several fancies. When I do the soft work I like but two to be present, then there cannot be too many of them. I do not like them for show but for enjoyment \u2014 \" To sooth away my soul in pleasure, When lying on that heart of thine, Ten thousand kisses shall be mine. Ten thousand kisses are too poor, Give me, love, ten thousand more.\" \u2014 Ahem. The wedding party returned to the room in which they had had their breakfast. There was wine upon the table ; the health, long life, and happiness of the couple was proposed by Mr. Blunt."], [507, "tom's wedding. 499 \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, addressing the company in the same style and manner he would have done had he been at the Eagle and Ball ; he had been so used to that sort of eloquence that it had become a mannerism. \"Ladies and gentle men, \u2014 It gives me great pleasure to see you all upon this happy occasion ; not only the bride, God bless her. I hope, as I have no doubt she has, this day begun a career of happiness, wliich will continue her whole life long. Not only the bridegroom, whom I am proud to congratulate upon tbe great treasure he has this day taken to his heart. May they be happy in the love of each other, and day after day, and month after month, and year after year, may they see that love increase ; when the time shall come that bodily pleasures shall lose their charm, may they have a recollection of a well-spent life, and, as they bave climbed the hill in the affections of each other, so may they go down aud be able to say at the foot, ' Blessings on your frosty po', John Anderson my Joe.' Not only the married people, who can tell how much happiness there is in a well-assorted match, but the single young men and women I see before me. I would, especially on this occasion, address myself to them. To the young women \u2014 bless them ! \u2014 the mothers of the next generation, the soothers and consolers of man when be retires to bis own fire-side disgusted with tbe buffettings of a selfish world, to you I would say, be not too fastidious ; make choice of a good young man, and try to be happy. Never mind trying to be rich, try to be happy. You may have wealth as great as the Bank of England ; but if you have the sickness at heart which spoils happiness, what is wealth ? It cannot give you the happiness, without which life is a burden, and not a joy. A stranger to the world may admire your fortune, your station, your equipage; but if the heart be ill at ease, what is the admiration of the world? No compensation at all. If the casket be splendid, and the envy of every one, what is that if its contents are horrors? Tbe outsiders may admire the architecture of the house, but the tenant may be wretched indeed. No, my pretty dears, if there be no love do not marry. Better live in single blessedness than double wretchedness. To you, young men, you bachelors, you"], [508, "500 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. fast fellows, I say get married and be happy. You think the apartments in Liberty Hall are better than those in the Temple of Hymen. It is a mistake, a myth, a fiction, the opinion of in experience. No ; there is no life so happy as a wedded one. I say, get married ; do not stand hiver-hovering and shilly-shally ing, but pop the question at once. Look at the bright eyes around you, do not they deserve a response? Leave fusty bachelordom ; do not be afraid ' Of woman, nature's darling treasure, For fear she'd make your treasure less.' Away with all that nonsense, and get married ; be a householder and a respectable member of society. Remember 'the world must be peopled.' Leave off the wickedness you have committed, and do that which is lawful and right. I give the toast I hope I soon shall have the pleasure of giving for each of you, ladies as well as gentlemen, 'Long life and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Tom.'\" The toast was drank with all the honours. In the temples of the olden time a veil was drawn behind the altar, and none but the initiated were permitted to enter into its mysteries ; and so we must do with the remainder of Tom's wedding. The veil must not be lifted. Suffice it to say Tom and Peggy kept the sign of the \" Jolly Coachman,\" and many and many were the merry nights on which Mr. Blunt presided. Tom kept bis house respectable, and was on all occasions glad to see his old friends. Some five years after these events I was passing the Jolly Coachman, and there stood at the door a little boy, just breeched. His costume was that of a miniature coachman. \" Is that yours, Tom ?\" said I. \"Yes Sir.\" \" He's a very fine boy, indeed.\" \" I flatter myself he is, Sir,\" said Tom. \" Pull off your hat, and show the gentleman your hair.\" \"Ah!\" said I, \"auburn, and curly.\" \"Like mine, Sir,\" said Tom, \"like mine.\""], [509, "SETTLING. 501 CHAPTER LXVIII. SETTLING. \" Jonx,\" said my mother, \"it is time you began to think about settling ; long before I was your age I wanted to settle, and I am sure if you have a proper respect for yourself you will settle. I say you must settle, and the sooner the better ; you are the only child I have, and how is our family to be perpetuated if you do not settle. Now, John, my dear, I hope you will seriously consider the propriety of settling ; look out for some dear young lady, who is a good child to her parents, then you may depend upon it she will be a good wife to you. I could look out a dozen for you if you would allow me ; not that you should have a dozen wives at once, like a three-tailed pasha ; you can have but one house, therefore you could have no use for them \u2014 no, one good and kind wife is quite enough for you. I know it is no use for me to look out a wife for you \u2014 you would not have one of my choosing ; but choose one for yourself, like a man.\" \" But, mother,\" said I, \" I do not want a wife ; that is a piece of furniture I should not know what to do with.\" \" Do not tell me, John,\" said she, \" you or any other man know well enough, and if you do not it is a lesson you will soon learn ; I do not like a man to make excuses of that sort. Be careful in your choice, and keep to the one you have chosen ; if you go flirting about with many you will never be devoted to one, and a man who is not devoted to his wife is not good for much.\" \" But, mother,\" said I, \" is not a woman the root of all evil ? I have heard my father say that there is no sin or crime committed in this world but somehow or other a woman is the cause.\" \" It is all stuff and nonsense, and your father knows it ; you men like to banter us women ; it pleases you and does us no"], [510, "502 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. harm.

It is stuff \u2014 an old joke, as old as Adam ; you men are so little given to think for yourselves that you keep repeating the old joke, and laugh at it every time as if you had never heard it before ; it is a very little thing which pleases the men, and I say let them be pleased. A woman who is a woman will laugh at such small wit. The cause of sin indeed I I should like to know, then, who is the cause of virtue \u2014 you wicked men, I suppose ; do not tell me, I have lived in the world too long to be imposed upon by such nonsense. You settle, John, and do not be scared away by any such delusions. You may sit at home by the fireside, and tell ghost stories and hear ghost stories, and dream about ghosts and think about ghosts, and rack your brains about ghosts, until at last you begin to believe in them, and dare not stir abroad for fear you should be gobbled up by one Turn such nonsense out of your mind \u2014 women are women, and not ghosts.\" \" But, mother, would it not be better for me to live in single blessedness ?\" \" No, John, it would not; single bltsseduess, indeed \u2014 single fiddle sticks.

John, John, I should never have thought this of you; I am sure I have been speaking for vour good.

I must confess I was grieved at the manner she received my banter, and knowing how I could readily obtain forgiveness and remove the pain I had caused, I put my arm round her neck, as I had done many a time when I was a boy, and I said, \" Mother, forgive me ; I was joking ; I could not seriously wish my mother to become extinct or a fossil, nor could I ever wish that any new Franken stein should arise to invent machinery wliich should supersede that wonderful machine wbich every man has had at sometime in his life reason to bless \u2014 his mother. No, mother, in childhood you cared for me before I knew what care was ; in boyhood you loved me, when I did not know its meaning, in sickness you have been my nurse, in sorrow my comforter, in trouble the soother of my soul, and may my tongue become dumb, my right arm perish, and that immortal spirit with which God has blessed me be hurled from its throne; yes, let me become a drivelling idiot before I think a thought or do a deed which shall give my mother pain ! \" I kissed her as I had used to kiss her when I was a boy ; she kissed me again, and with her hand she gently turned my hair off my forehead.

I was always modest and timid when women were concerned ; it therefore required all my courage to begin. I could face a mad bull, and assist to throw the rope over his horns; I could be cool and collected in tbe midst of a raging fire, when my all was being burnt; I could meet the midnight thief and not quail ; I could walk through the chamber where the destroying pestilence was su preme and feel no fear ; yet if I had to speak to a woman upon"], [513, "SETTLING. 505 the tender passion, I was a poltroon and a coward. My tongue, which was voluble as a brawling brook, or rattled on like a mill clapper, was then all timid and silent. But on the Sunday evening I determined to sally out and commence my labours in tlie tender line. I stood at the corner of the street until the daughter of a neighbour came by, whom I had observed managed to meet me whenever I went out. She looked at me slily, then bent her head to the ground, and blushed. I did not know what it meant, but as my mother wished me to settle, I thought it might mean something about settling, so I said, \" Jemima.\" She stopped with a turn on her heel, and said, \"John.\" Lord, thought I, how foolish two lovers are when they begin to love. I played with my watch chain. She put the strings of her bonnet into her mouth and chewed them. \" Jemima,\" said I, \"what are you chewing your ribbon for?\" \"1 don't know, John,\" said she. \" What are you twisting your watch chain for ?\" and we stood simple-like, blushing at each other. I caught hold of her strings and tried to slip the knot, for I had heard that the first passage in love was to untie the apron strings, but as she had not an apron on I untied her bonnet strings. The second passage I intended to try some other day ; that is to stand at a distance where you cannot be seen, and throw little stones at your sweetheart, who should say \" throw your lumps where you throw your love,\" and the young man should say, \" So I do my dear.'' She should say, witb a sigh, \" Ah, you are not in earnest.\" On this occasion we stood looking at each other, then bending our bodies and turning round upon our heels, we burst out laughing. This we did so many times as to leave numbers of screw-like marks which we had made with our heels. \" Jemima,\" said I, \" will you go a walk?\" \"John,\" said she, \" will you go to chapel ?\" I was young then, and inexperienced, and thought chapel too solemn a place for courting, but I have since learned that bright eyes can flash the love-look there, and the form which is supplicating God can withdraw from that holy duty and throw a witching glance which shall captivate mair. Then, I repeated, \"Jemima, let us go a walk.\" But she said, \"No, John, let us go to chapel.\" As I was always of a yielding dis position, I consented. \"What chapel shall we go to?\" said I, \" I have no choice, John, anywhere.\" I must cotifess I liked the"], [514, "506 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. answer. I thought it a true womanly answer. She did not care what religion her husband was, if religious. His religion should be her religion. Before the shrine at wliich he bowed his head she would kueel. She would be with him in life and with him in eternity. \" Suppose,\" said I, \" we go to Little Bethel ?\" \" Very well,\" said she. So we went to Little Bethel. I must confess that there was a little management in my choice of Little Bethel. The people who went there were all strangers to me, and I thought I might go there and be as snug and secret as if we had walked into the fields and seen nothing but sheep and oxen. But the course of true love never did run smooth, and I suppose never \"won't.\" As we walked down tbe aisle looking for a seat, who should be there but a fast and intimate friend of my father's ; a man, too, who loved a joke, and would hunt it like a keen sportsman. He opened his pew door and invited me into his seat. As I stood aside for Jemima to enter first he looked at both of us with the greatest astonishment. I thought I could hear him think, I have got you my boy and now I will roast you. I felt as if I was going to sink into my shoes. There was I, modest aud retiring, ashamed to be seen to speak to a young lady, by an unexpected course of events brought into contact with the man I knew would tease my lite out. O, if I had known what would have taken place, I never would have said \"Jemima.\" When we went into the chapel the people were singing. My father's friend banded me his book, and Jemima and I put our heads together to sing the same hymn. When I began to sing, I held up my head, as I usually do when I am singing, and as true as I am here, the parson looked at me with a scowling frown. What, thought I, is it a sin to go courting to chapel, and has he found me out ? I stopped singing instantly, and thought to be sure that when he began to preach he would choose for his text, \" Thy sins shall find thee out,\" and that I should be sure to catch it. As soon as the singing was done, he gave out tbe chapter he was going to read, and then said, looking at me and Jemima as sulkily as a bear, \" It is expected that people who come to worship here will take their seat before the service begins. If the service should be begun before they arrive, then that they should wait until the singing is done, the reading is done, or the prayer is done, as the case may be, and"], [515, "SETTLING, 507 not walk into this place of worship during any of these times, disturbing the congregation. It is but a small inconvenience to wait at the door uutil the part which is being gone through is ended, and even if it were great, what is the inconvenience\" of a little creature like you to \"that of this congregation ?\" Oh, I thought I should sink. I held down my head and I blushed. I went so hot tbat the perspiration poured down me. I pulled out my handkerchief to wipe my* hands. I could not keep them dry. I groaned inwardly. 'Oh, Jemima, I wish I had never said \" Jemima.\" There had been a nasty cold east wind on the day or two previous, and on the night of tbe Saturday and the morning of the Sunday it rained, so that most of the people had colds. Therefore \" Cou^hinz drowned the parson's saw, And Marian's nose was red and raw.5 My Jemima had a very bad cold indeed, and standing at the corner of the street, turning ourselves upon our heels, had made it much worse. Her cough became so violently troublesome she could not suppress it. She tried to clear her throat by one good strong effort. Upon this the parson stopped suddenly in the very mid ale of his reading, and looked fiercely at Jemima, and said, \" If you have not the good manners to prevent that cough ing, you ought at least to have the good manners to leave the place ; it is a place of worship, and not a place in which to indulge in coughing ad libitum ; you had better go home than annoy everyone else.\" Ob, Jemima, I wish I had never said \" Jemima ;\" into what troubles you have brought me. M y father said truly, that a woman leads a man into trouble. Jemima began to cry. She got up and went out. I sat still, for I had had enough of her disgracing me before a whole congregation. But my father's friend whispered to me, \" John, John, come, be polite ; you brought her in, see her out.\" The parson stopped and looked at me most angrily. The faces of all the people were turned towards me, aud those in the gallery stretched their necks to look at me. Despair made me valiant.

THE BILL. The wire-drawer received his bill. As he turned it over page after page, his astonishment was extreme ; many six-and-ei\u00b0dit pences, a few three shillings and sixpences, and several consulta tion fees \u2014 a large retaining fee for the barrister, and an additional one for his clerk, though he had not so much as seen his clerk \u2014 knew nothing of the dress he wore \u2014 the shape of his phiz, or the colour of his nose. If any one were required to make an affidavit of his existence it must be other than the wire-drawer, for all that he knew of his existence was that he was down in the bill \u2014 though that among legal men might be very strong presumptive evidence ; for you know that a barrister is an honourable man, and will not upon any account pros titute his honour for gain. Yet it was no evidence tc the wire-drawer. All these items together made the large sum of one hundred and eighty-five pounds, three shillings, and eleven pence. As a finishing item there was \"making out this bill, two guineas,\" and a note at the bottom, \" This is my bill, Richard feparrow, Attorney-at-Law.\" The bill was written out in one hand, and the signature in another. If the wire-drawer had but heard the comments of the clerk as he was making it out, he would have been irritated indeed. All the time he was copying it he was in a state of high glee, and was saying : \" That is a poser for him ; how I should like to see him when he reads that. There is a stinger,\" said he at another entry, \" Ha, ha, ha ! My eye, won't he stare at this. Well, if this man has got any sense in his head, I should think this would teach him the folly of going to law, or becoming a sort of public prosecutor, determined to punish the unfortunate. But it takes some people a long while to"], [518, "510 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. learn this lesson, especially if you will keep the bill away from them.\" When he had finished it, he took it in to Mr. Sparrow, who signed it, as I have said. As he returned into his own office, he introduced himself into bis own thoughts. \" Ah,\" said he, \"my governor makes a large income by the law, but poor me, and others like me, make nothing ; it is as much as we can do to live. I look on, and see and know that the law is but the means by which a fortune is made by him and lost by his clients. Justice may sometimes be among ils incidents, but money making is the rule and intention ; but nol for me, not for me. I may sit and toil on until my blood stagnates with inaction. Far into the night, when others press the downy pillow in sweet slumber, I, a poor drudge, must work ou with no sound but the scribble of the pen to cheer me \u2014 no hope that I shall ever become richer. Year after year will pass away \u2014 year alter year I must sit and labour \u2014 a poor lawyer's clerk, until the grave with its long sleep shall give relief. To how many poor wretches like me is life a burden, and the grave a welcome friend ! I sometimes think that the world and all it contains was made by a good and kind Being, but when made He retired to His throne, satisfied with the good He had done, and left his works to be contended for by the opposite forces of good and evil. Away with such thoughts ; why should I, like a poor melancholy man, throw over the works of God my own gloom, and believe it to be their quality, when it is only the tone of my own sad heart \u2014 the cloud and the mist which creeps over the landscape, and makes every thing wretched and dreary?\" Such were the reflections of the poor clerk, when he compared the poverty of himself with the wealth of his employer. How often is it that sensitive minds are overcome and depressed by a passing thought or a transient trouble, and then they say they labour and labour without success ; when it seems as if every effort was to end in defeat, and that there was no use trying ; for all, though began witb a will, would end with a broken heart. How often is it that minds, under the influence of defeat, look sullenly upon life, and think it not worth contending for, and, if it were not for the fear of a hereafter, would throw a soul away, and violently leave a world in which they had no victories, no recollections worth recalling, and no expectations worth contending for."], [519, "THE BILL. 511 As I have said, the wire-drawer's astonishment at the amount of his bill was great ; so great that, contrary to his usual manner, he was at first perfectly stunned by its size. He kept repeating the amount : \" One hundred and eighty-five pounds, three shillings, and elevenpence ! What, is it so ? one hundred and eighty-five pounds three shillings and eleven pence ! Oh, no ! A mistake in reckoning it up. Not one hundred and eighty-five pounds, three shillings, and eleven pence ! Though signed by Mr. Sparrow, it was written out by his clerk I see, and he has made some blundering mistake. Mr. Sparrow is a respectable man; stands high in his profession ; is above the suspicion of overcharges, or the desire to make business tbat he may make a bill. Let me see, let me see. Three and two are five, and eight are thirteen, and eight are twenty-one, and six are twenty-seven, and eight are thirty-five \u2014 two shillings and elevenpence. The pence are right at any rate; so are the shillings; so are the pounds.\" And he turned over leaf after leaf, adding them up as be went along, and found all correct. It was one hundred and eighty- five pounds, three shillings, and elevenpence. \" D the bill,\" be exclaimed. \" What's it all mean ? Wrhat I ' to waiting upon you to receive instruction to oppose Mr. Mincher in the Court of Bankruptcy, six shillings and eightpence.' What ! six shillings and eightpence for that ? What's the fellow mean ! Six shillings and eightpence for receiving the order ! What the dickens does that mean ? What, charge me money for giving him an order. I give people money who bring me au order, but it seems this fellow charges for receiving an order. He must have been hard up to make out a bill when he began it in that way. What! 'upon advising you to have a barrister, six and eightpence ; to retaining barrister, six and eightpence ; to receiving barrister's reply, six and eightpence; to advising you he was retained, six and eightpence ; to preparing his brief, six guineas ; to office copy, two guineas ; to fair copy of same, two guineas ; to clerk, one guinea ; to barrister, his fee, fifty guineas ; to his clerk, five guineas ; paying the same, six and eightpence ; ditto to clerk, six and eightpence.' \" As he read these items his passion gradually rose. At the last item it attained its climax. He threw the bill with great violence against the opposite side of the apartment, and shouted at the very top of his voice, \"D"], [520, "512 RECOLLECTIONS OF A- TRADESMAN. the bill, the lawyer, the barrister, his clerk, and all the crew. Are they in a conspiracy to rob me ? Is that the end and object of all that form and nonsense? The man who meets me in the street and robs me, may be a thief, but is he a thief like these ? The one comes openly and gives me a chance to defend myself; but these thieves come craftily, smoothly ; flattering one, robbing one under the banner of those laws which are made to protect \u2014 the boasted safeguards of tbe land. Yes, they are safeguards ; safe but to none but themselves. Too often the ruin of the young, the struggling, and the inexperienced ; but what do these men care? About as much as does the hawk for the poor bird which he holds in his talons and tears, looking up like him, to the Author of Justice before he begins the meal. They will act in a way which will consign a whole family to ruin, then go home and drink their wine as if they had done a deed of merit. Lord, Lord, what a world is this in which we live, one robs you of your hard-earned gains, and another, under the pretence of justice, robs you again !\" The wire-drawer's passion was great. He said more when under its influence than he would ever say when be was cool. Every person who has had experience knows whether the character he gave legal men was a just one. No. It was wrong to take up the traditionary or the popular reputation which tbe world has, by common consent, assigned to them. A small experience will enable you to judge if that reputation is deserved. \" What shall I do,\" he continued, ' am I obliged to pay this. If I go to him what will he say ? ' That is my bill, Sir. I have not charged you all I might have done, if other men in the profession had had your case your bill would have been doubled ; but my maxim is moderate charges and plenty of business. I depend more upon the extent of my business than upon making every charge the law permits me. If you think I have overcharged you, have the bill taxed ; the taxing master will allow me every penny.' To Fury with the taxing master and all the lot of them, they are all banded together to serve each other and victimise the public.\" At this time the umbrella maker entered. He looked amazed at the wire-drawer and at the bill which lay on the opposite side of the room where it had been thrown. \" Look there,\" said the wire-drawer ; what a bill that thief Sparrow has sent me in \u2014 one hundred and eighty-five"], [521, "513 THE BILL, pounds, three shillings, and elevenpence. I cannot make out what for ; there is item after item put down there of which I know nothing \u2014 things which might have happened are charged for ; whether they did or not I have no means of saving. But this I can say, that every occurrence is charged for that could by any possibility happen.\" \"I know,\" said the umbrella maker, \" the old story \u2014 a large bill for little services; my lawyer is a good fellow while he is fighting my little fight, but when his bill comes in, what a bouncing over-charging rascal he is ! There is no redress for these things slow ; the law acknowledges that these abuses exist by appointing a taxing master, but it is a mere pretence, like all other legal checks upon legal men, and affords no security; the keenness of wit generated by practice enables them to make every check a source of profit. This is an expensive lesson, but if you learn from it the wisdom you ought to learn, it may be cheap to you. You know enough of me and my opinions \u2014 for I have heard you contemptuously call them cant \u2014 to know that I believe tbat this world is carried on by a series of compensations, the result always being good \u2014 if in the summer there be too many flies, all the tribes which live upon flies wonderfully increase. The swallow skims through the air and screams with enjoyment, the fish leaps from the water and snaps at the dancing flies until be becomes lazy with fatness, the dog and cat jump at them, the hunting spider springs upon them, and the spinning spider lays in wait in every nook and spins his web in every place of vantage. When the flies are gone the swallow goes to other lands, the fish look for other food, the spiders lie dessicated skeletons, or seek the protection of warm crevices, and hibernate until their food returns again. It is the mode Providence has adopted to prevent what no doubt is useful in the world, from becoming a nuisance; and I believe these men, these parasites of society, who, like other paiasites, live and flourish best where there are the humours and dirt upon which such things live, are in the order of Providence to be classed with the hawks, the cat, the sharks, and the spiders the way in which what would otherwise become a nuisance is removed, the vision of the near-sighted cleared, and wisdom taught to men who would never otherwise learn it. When Moses stretched out his rod and smote the dust of the earth, so that all K"], [522, "514 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. the dust became lice, there is no doubt but there was another object besides that of softening the hard heart of Pharoah, for they are left on the earth after the purpose for which they were miracul ously created has passed away ; they may be useful in their places, but they are excessively disagreeable. No doubt when their end is accomplished they will go out of existence.\" \" What has all this to do with me?\" said the wire-drawer, that being the test to which he reduced everything if it had nothing to do with him ; he would have nothing to do with it if he could help it. \"What has all this to do with me ? I am here charged an extravagant bill for work I have no means of checking. What am I to do?\" \" Very true, that is very true, what are you to do with that bill ? Why, pay it, and never incur another ; if you gain wisdom at that price it will be cheap to you.\" \" What ! am I to pay whatever is charged?\" \"Well, you had better.\" \"I will see him at Old Nick first.\" \"A wilful man must have his way,\" said the umbrella maker, \"and must suffer the consequences of bis wilful ness; it will be all upon your head.\" \"Do you advise, then, that when I suffer injustice I should submit ?\" \" It will depend much upon the case. The wrong you received from Mr. Mincher you attempted to right by persecuting a man who, if honest, had not the means of righting you ; therefore no amount of persecu tion, and no amount of trouble you could heap upon the man would give him the means ; it was not in the nature of the case, and therefore could not come out of it. You have now another injustice in the shape of, to you, an unexpectedly large bill \u2014 if you resist the payment further injustice will come upon you. You see an enquiry should have been made into Mr. Mincher's affairs, and an arrangement come to among ourselves. The best might have been made of it, and this bill of yours saved; as it is you must pay it, making the best arrangement you can.\" \" I never will,\" said the wire-drawer, \" I will suffer anything first.\" \" Well, if he finds he can do nothing with you he will perhaps arrest you ; your arrest will appear in Ferry's List, then your credit will at once be gone, and you will be ruined. Thus you see that your endeavouring to seek justice as you thought has brought you a large bill, another injustice. Resisting that, you will be arrested again on another. You will then appear in Ferry's List \u2014 let me say a most mischievous publication, whieh"], [523, "THE BILL. 515 has been the ruin of many a man, and I may say the protection of none. It may delight the envious, the censorious, and tbe in quisitive, who nave an especial pleasure iu the difficulties of others, but is no guide to a true tradesman. My advice to you is to leave the law alone ; have nothing to do with it. As you are now in its clutches, get out as soon as you can, and keep out, or you will be a poor man before you are aware.\" \" Well, Sir, that is pretty advice, indeed ; a rogue is to rob you, and then the rogue is to go free ! That is your doctrine, is it?\" \"A rogue is rather a strong expression ; a word which some men use without attaching a clear meaning to it. To some, all who do not comply with their desires are rogues. It is a generic term, rather than a specific one, and, like all generic terms, includes many species, apparently very wide apart. You must first know what is the roguery which constitutes the rogue, before you can receive a true answer. If you use it as an expletive \u2014 a word to relieve your mind, like a curse or an oath \u2014 why, it may pass without more notice; yet even expletives are best avoided, for they seldom mean anything. But there must be a definite idea to the word ere the judgment can decide. Calling a man a rogue does not make him such. Strong language is like the sound of a drum, loud and monoton ous, but not veiy musical \u2014 a military tone, and, like everything militant, seldom discriminate. If you mean that Mr. Mincher was a rogue, I say I think not ; he may have done things which I should not bave done; yet, still, they are things which all legal men advise under the circumstances, and which the law evidently contemplates, for no other way is left; yet I would not do them. It is one thing to know that such things are done and advised, and another thing to do them. It is right to have a knowledge of the ways of honest men and rogues \u2014 indeed, a knowledge of the way of the world, to pass through the world witb close and correct observation \u2014 but wrong to do many things which the world does, and then goes to pray. With men of warm tempera ment, like you, the word rogue is a ready weapon, always at hand and so free'ly used that it has no meaning, or an opposite one ; like the frequent ringing of an alarm bell, at first it may arouse tbe neighbourhood, but by repetition it becomes a nuisance. It is too much the practice of men of your temperament to say and believe that men who have a knowledge of roguery, as you call it"], [524, "516 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. must be rogues themselves, or they would not have learned the lesson, when the man may be no more than a quick and correct observer \u2014 has an intuitive perception of the diagnostics of life, and nothing whatever of the rogue about him. Whether you are to submit to roguery or not, depends upon circumstances. In the particular case before us, submission will be the cheapest and the only way I should advise. Then repent of your doings, and never do the like again. Pay the bill as soon as possible, and get rid of the irritation it has caused.\" \" I will see him and all his crew \" \"Hush, hush! Neither curse nor swear. Let it be a question to which you will give an answer to-morrow, when your feelings have abated. While the passion is upon you commit yourself to nothing, or pride will take up and continue the error passion began. I wish you good morniug, and hope to hear you have acted upon second thoughts, always the wisest thoughts a man has. Let this be your golden rule \u2014 ' If you would not be a sinner, keep away from the abodes of sin ! ' ' I should give a very false impression, if the only one I gave by these \" Recollections\" was that the legal gentlemen of the generation just passed away were all of them men whose chief and only desire was to make a bill to get money anyhow. No. So far as my experience went, I found men witb hearts as kind among them as could be found in any profession. It is their duty to do the best they can for their clients. Sometimes they are required to act with harshness, but let me say this, that I have seen it done with genuine sorrow and forbearance, and I have known advice given worthy of a man and a Christiau. If I have given specimens of another sort, let it be remembered they were individuals, and that in all professions there are some who disgrace it, however honourable the body may be. To pick up a broken flower, and say all flowers are therefore broken \u2014 to exhibit a deformed man, and say all men are deformed \u2014 to go into a land over which the storm has just passed, withering and destroying, and say the country is all blasted and torn \u2014 might be correct of the instances given, but very false, and very far from the truth, when the experience was more enlarged. Never condemn a body because of the sins of individuals, nor at any time speak roundly in censure."], [525, "517 CONCLUSION. CHAPTEK LXX. CONCLUSION. It would be very wrong in me to trouble the reader with my sorrows and sufferings. I will merely say that my father and mother caught the typhus fever and died within a few hours of each other. Though they were ripe in years, I grieved for them I hope with a manly grief; and I may truly say that I never really knew their value until I had lost them and wanted their advice, which was very soon. I thought it my duty to attend to the construction of their grave. I was in this way brought in contact with the graved igger, a man I had frequently seen at his work; I had observed that he usually sang or talked to him self; that the songs he sang were monotonous, consisting of not more than three or four notes, and I supposed in vogue with gravediggers only, for I do not remember to have heard them sung by other persons. The tune was a species of Gregorian chant, and doubtless had been handed down from man to man ever since grave digging had become a calling. Though in grief I stood by him, as I thought it my duty to watch that the grave he dug had not been before used ; for somehow I had a feeling I cannot explain nor account for, that I should not like the remains of my parents or my own \u2014 for I hope to lie in the same grave\u2014 to be mixed up with those of others. It was foolish, no doubt; but by how many foolish feelings and foolish sentiments are we all swayed ? The night side of our nature cannot be defended, and it cannot be shaken off. We laugh at the phantoms which seers have seen, yet if we would be honest to ourselves, and honest to the world, we should confess that we do not walk through the lonely churchyard at midnight with the same fearlessness that we do at mid-day. I"], [526, "518 RECOLLECTI0N9 OF A TRADESMAN. have heard some boast that they do so, and yet have known them go a long way round to avoid going through one when mid darkness covered tbe world. The songs which I had heard the gravedigger sing had all some reference to his calling, and usually consisted of common-place reflections upon the vanity of life and the certainty of death. They all made death an unrelenting republican, who gathered kings and kaisers, and peers and beggars, into his insatiable maw with the utmost indifference. The sweep is black, the miller is white, and the gravedigger, like the gardener, is brown, the colour of the dust among which he works. I had determined to have the grave fourteen feet deep. As it was being dug, I sat by the side musing how much use removed the ideas which imagination at first impressed upon our minds. \" This man,\" thought I, \" was once a child, and had all a child's fears ; but now he works among the dead and sings. The remains of several generations lie around him, and he treats them with the same indifference as if he were working in an open field, with the lark singing above his head. He would take up the bones of the daintiest beauty, the skull of the squire, or the hand of 'my lord,' and chuck them into the charnel house, and never think of the vanity or the pride wbich once characterised the beings to whom those bones belonged. Does he stand alone, or is bis behaviour a sample of the world ? The flesh and bone and sinew which made tbe men who once lorded it in the land have returned lo dust, and tbe debris of man is but dust. The abbey and the castle from whose walls the man dales were issued of great ones once potent in tbe world, are in ruins; tbe dock and the nettle flourish where pride once osten tatiously strutted. Solitude reigns where the words of command were once issued, and the dust of the abbey and the castle and of men have returned to the same insignificance. 0, why should man be vain ? The remains of the generations passed away the living one calls a nuisance; says it gives out a poisonous miasma, and must be moved away from the habitations of men. My own flesh and blood are dear to me, whether alive or dead ; but to the world who have not my attachments, they are a nuisance. Is it so ? O ye dainty ones who adorn yourselves with the silks of the sunny lands, who noddle your heads with Afric's plumes, who beautify yourselves with cosmetics, and steal the perfume"], [527, "CONCLUSION. 519 from tbe rose ; for whom men go down into the sea for pearls, and deep into the dark mines for diamonds ; is it so ? That when the soul which animates that piece of clay is gone, that clay shall be a nuisance to man? Why, then, are you vain ? Do you think at all ? If thoughts bring sadness and sadness no change, go on in vanity and think not at all. Only speculate who are ' pretty girls,' and do not think what a nuisance the prettiest girl will some day become.\" As I sat beside the grave the grave- digger struck with his pick what I thought was a stone ; he scraped the soil away from each side of it, then began working on the other side of the grave, singing all the time. \"How long,\" said I, \"have you worked at this calling?\" \"Ever since I was a boy,\" said he, \"a matter of forty-five years; there is not a grave in this yard but I have some time or other opened. I have buried, Sir, the grandfathers, the fathers, and the children. Many who were great men in their days I have buried.\" \" Do the friends of the dead,\" said I, \" ever come to visit the graves of those lying here?\" \"Sometimes,\" said he, \" sometimes for a few days and weeks, they do ; but generally they lay them here, and then seem to forget them. The rich bring the bodies with a great procession ; they have the service in the church, from the church and over the grave, and a crowd of people come with them.\" \"Yes, their friends,\" said I. \"Well, then, their friends,\" said he, dubiously ; \" for the rich have many friends, but a crowd of people, I say, come with them. They always say what a fine funeral it was, and talk about who was there. They seldom show much grief, unless there be a young lady among them. She cries, and all tbe others try to comfort her; but when she gets older, she is like me, death does not have much effect upon her. The people who come here without show, seem to feel it most ; they cry and grieve, and when they hear me throw the dirt on the coffin, as the parson says, ' Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,' they cry most. Now, they come often, and grieve a long while. The very poor cry the most ; they come often on a Sunday; they seem never to forget the grave which belongs to them, especially the women, even though a many years have passed away. I think poverty makes people love each other, and riches make people selfish and quarrelsome.\" \" Are many great"], [528, "520 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. people lyiug in this churchyard ?\" said I. \" 0 yes ; there, now, is a great physician in the grave next but two to this. You see, if you read the head stone, be was but forty-nine when he died, though he was a doctor. The next to him is Billy Knight ; he was a man, now, he was. He enjoyed himself all the days of his life as a sensible fellow should. He never missed a night at the Three Crowns ; he sang his song, smoked his pipe, and told his story, and enjoyed himself. Life was life to him. Now, he was a man, he was. But the greatest man in this churchyard lies iu the next but one to him. His son has his grave made up twice a year, and gives me half-a-crown each time for doing it. He was a great man.\" \"If you were to have half-a-crown\" said I, \" twice a year, for all these graves, it would be a good thing for you.\" \" Ah,\" said he, with a contemptuous sneer, \" folks are so shabby, and have no respect for their relations.\" As he said this he turned to work at what I thought was a stone, but he seemed to know what it was as soon as he touched it. When he had sufficiently freed it he pulled it out and threw it to the surface. I must confess that I felt shocked, for it was a tibia ; tbe earth lie had loosened at the bottom of the grave he threw up rapidly, and covered the bone therewith. He came out of the grave un concernedly as if to rest himself, but I observed he looked fur tively at the place where he had thrown the tibia, as I thought, to see if it were covered. I think my silence betrayed my feel ings. \" Phew,\" said he, blowing, \" this is dusty work.\" \" Do you feel ill after your work?\" said I, for when I thought that most of the bodies among whom he laboured, died of some disease, I thought also that the virus of the disease of which they died must do its work upon him. But he said, \" not particularly ; if I get some beer to swill it down, I never hurt.\" \" Beer,\" said I, in surprise, for I was young then, and had not experience to know what a universal panacea with the working man beer is. \" Beer, what is beer so excellent an antidote to the virus of the dead?\" \" I find it so,\" said he. \" When I have been digging a grave like this, and have plenty of beer, I feel no hurt ; and it's my belief, that beer, in moderation, mind you, three or four pints to the grave, will always keep the poison of dead bodies away. I have worked long enough among it, and I have always found it so, and so will anybody else as tries it.\" Of course I"], [529, "CONCLUSION. 521 could do nothing but take the hint. As he put the money I gave him into his pocket, \" That bone,\" said he, nodding his head over his shoulder to the tibia he had thrown up, \" belonged to a lady, as proud a one as any who ever lived.\" \" And you,\" said I, \"throw it about in that way.\" \"What's it matter?\" said he, \" sbe is nobody now, and knows nothing about it. It is not shocking to the dead, they are past that, but it is the living who are hurt, the dead know nothing, and with the living it is all fancy.\" I certainly was shocked, which I tbink he observed. \" Leave it to me, Sir,\" said he, \" leave it to me, I shall be away about an hour, but leave it to me, and I will make the grave all right.\" I left and returned again in about an hour and a half. I found him working and singing as before, and by the quantity of work he had done I believe he had not left the grave at all, but that he had passed a ruse upon me to get me out of the way while the rest of the lady's bones were thrown from the grave and carried to the charnel house, for the tibia was gone, and I saw bits of rotten wood among the spoil of the grave. I have since thought that the ancient dead were removed to make way for the modern. Had I thought so at the time I would have had another grave- Over the dead let a pall be thrown, and let that pall cover the grief which I grieved when I laid my parents in the grave I had seen dug. W hen I lie upon the hill side upon a summer's evening and see the sun go down, I feel sad, and wonder if he be going to the islands of the blest where my parents are. I know it is a wild fancy, but how many of the fancies which give a charm to life are also wild. I think the evening cloud is like death; it is sombre and sad, but fringed with a sheen which tells of the dazzling glory beyond. In concluding this series of recollections it will naturally be asked how the matters in bankruptcy terminated. I went to another meeting. There were one or two attorneys, and a few chief clerks representing others. What was going on was done in an undertone, and in a manner I could not understand, but I was informed the sitting was further adjourned for a profit and loss aecount. No one took an interest in the case excepting the officials. What they had to say was said in a slovenly but foppish tone, and they who were not speaking had an idle lounging manner. They were stretching and gaping, but it was soon all"], [530, "522 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. over. The fees had been made, the papers were gathered up, and bound in red tape. They were put under tbe arm, and the men who, at the former meeting had been opposed to each other, walked away arm-in-arm engaged in comfortable chat. The court dissolved and went home. What a novice would call the hall of justice was deserted. An old woman with a blue cotton dress, a handkerchief for a bertha, and a dirty flabby cap, shot the bolts and locked it up, a proceeding I have seen in courts of justice where greater men than these presided, which I at first approached with feelings of great veneration, believing they were halls which every lover of his country should reverence, in which the great men of the past have sought out the battle of liberty ; but, alas ! a cynical spirit has come over me, and I have seen nothing there but the selfishness of man \u2014 tbe chicanery of life \u2014 reduced to a science. The worst passions of humanity had brought its results there; where fraud sought the fight with more effrontery than honesty defended its own ; where men prostitute their genius for gain as shamefully as tbe wanton prostitutes her virtue ; temples of justice in theory ; but, alas ! temples where money is made ; and if none were made they would soon become deserted and solitary places. When tbe reality of life comes over me I feel depressed and sad, and long to return again to it3 imaginations, for all its greatness when stripped of the halo with which imagination surrounds it is selfish and little \u2014 a thing to be admired when dressed out for an evening party, but to be shunned and avoided when about to take a bath. I took no further interest in the proceedings in bankruptcy ; there was adjournment after adjournment as long as there were funds. I saw that to the bankrupt it was ruin had he not taken the precaution to take care of himself; to the creditors an entire failure of justice, and to the legal gentlemen engaged a source of great gain. Several years after this event a dividend was declared of three farthings in tbe pound. I thought this a very impotent conclusion, for I well remembered that the balance-sheet presented to the court showed a balance of fifteen shillings in the pound. There was great difficulty in getting a sight of that balance-sheet, and when the dividend was declared I thought I saw why, for the legal gentlemen knew well that if the trading community saw how much of the property, truly theirs, was consumed in the courts"], [531, "523 CONCLUSION. and among them, saw, in fact, that when the estate was put in bankruptcy it became something to scramble for, they would take some other way of settling their losses. The dividend I thought ridiculously small. The wire-drawer, notwithstanding the severe losses he had had, still believed that if some one had followed the bankrupt up something would have been got out of him. He asked the accountant how it was there was so small a dividend. \" I suppose,\" said he, \" because there was no more to divide. You know the estate was iu the court a long time. All estates are there a long time. There are always so many questions to decide and so many interests to settle that you cannot expect them decided in a day.\" \"Do you think,\" said I, \"that the expenses of winding up made the dividend so small ?\" \" Pro bably,\" said he; \"indeed I may say yes, it always is so, and I do not see why not in this case.\" \" Could you ascertain f\" said the wire-drawer. \" Certainly,\" said the accountant, \" for the books are in my office. Now, I will answer the question if ycu wish it.\" \" WeU, I should like to know,\" said the wire-drawer. \" What will be the expense,\" said I, for I had the fear of an action of assumpsit before my eyes. \" O, trifling, very trifling,\" said the accountant. \"Will you do it for a guinea?\" said the wire-drawer, which he thought a very liberal sum. \" O dear no,\" said the accountant ; my time is most valuable ; it will take me long to answer ihe question ; I cannot siy less than fifteen guineas.\" \" Not less than fifteen guineas? ' said I; \"then it may be more.\" \"I cannot tell; I should think not,\" was the reply. The wire-drawer had had enough of these kind of answers, would find no more money, and so the question was never answered. In concluding the narrative of these events, let me say that I feel conscious that I have made some wrong inferences ; but I bave faithfully recorded the impressions the events made upon me. Early in life I was tausht to be observant, and endeavour to find a cause for evervthing I saw ; to woo nature as a lover ; to ask wtrv the bird? sang ; whv the flowers blowed ; to listen to the voices of the night, and in the spirit of Samuel to say, \" Here I am, for Thou did'st call me ; \" to learn to understand the music of the spheres, and to listen to the \" still small voice \" which is to be heard in everything ; to grieve at a tale of woe,"], [532, "524 RECOLLECTIONS OF A TRADESMAN. and to leap as a bounding hart at a thought of joy ; to look upon the stars with awe, and wonder what they are ; to learn to know the Workman by the work of His hands, and bow before the Majesty of His glory ; to look upon the deep, not as a waste of waters, but as a home for myriads of living things ; to look at this world, not as my home, but as its portals ; to feel that enthusiasm, when I thought of the works of nature, which I am ashamed to express ; to look upon the past, not as some thing wliich is dead, but as a storehouse of wisdom, whose lessons should be learned, if man would be wise ; to hug poesy as if she were a sister of mercy, who in sorrow would bring comfort, in sickness healing potions, in bereavement with an up ward finger point to the place of re-union ; when joy came, wrinkled with laughter, would look on and smile ; aud when I looked around upon the wonders by which I was surrounded, would say, as if taught by philosophy, that all had one plan, and were the works of one mind. It is said that when man \u2014 a dullard even \u2014 for the first time stands upon Snowden's heights, and looks down upon the world below, and its far away beauty and grandeur, he has henceforth poetry in his nature. So it was in the old time. When Moses went to speak with God, he went up iuto the mountain, and in its solitudes he spoke with Him. And what man is there now, with ripe faculties, who, when he goes up into the mountain, does not feel that he is conversing with his Maker ? It was no myth in the past, and it is no idle fancy in the present. It is not the dream of poetry, but the cool and thoughtful lesson which philosophy solemnly teaches. I have done. If imagination has sometimes run riot, I hope to be forgiven. MARTIN BILLING, SON, AND CO., PHINTBBa, LITEBY SIBEET, BIRMINGHAM."], [533, ""], [534, ""], [535, ""], [536, ""]]
