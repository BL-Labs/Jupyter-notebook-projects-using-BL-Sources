Glorious is a brigand's life, Free as any bird ; Full of danger, constant strife \u2014 Supper oft deferred. Pass around the sparkling wine, Tell another story droll, All trouble far away consign, And brim the flowing bowl. All trouble far away consign, And brim the flowing bowl. Riches fill our coffers fast, Lightly come and go ; You will always find it so, Though the pile be vast. Brim again the flowing bowl, Choose a vintage fine ; Nothing better can console Than fine old sparkling wine. Brim again the flowing bowl, Choose a vintage fine ; Nothing better can console Than fine old sparkling wine. Nothing better can console Than fine old sparkling wine. Now that we're all assembled, may I make so bold To ask why 'tis we're summoned here ? I've just been told Antonio"], [10, "6 'Tis business most important. Since our chief's away, Perhaps the brave Lorenzo a few words will say, And thus inform us as to what's in hand. Why is this meeting called ? Comrades, pray understand This business is the Captain's. He alone can tell Why he has brought us here. One thing, it's sure to swell Our almost eaipty pockets ; bring us lots of pelf : \u2014 (Enter Captain 1st. R.E. Zoriada hides herself.) Here comes our gallant Captain ! He'll speak for himself (All cheer). Captain ! The band awaits you. All here now ? That's right. I'm sorry comrades I could not be with you quite To time, and as already we're a little late, Let us commence at once. My plans I'll soon Lorenzo Lorenzo Captain relate. (The Band group themselves round the Captain). In yonder castle, you are well aware, There lives an officer who tries to scare Away all smugglers from this coast. Now they Are just the men who make our business pay ; We can't afford to lose our friends ? All No ! No ! ! Captain 'Tis settled then ! This Colonel soon shall go To Davy Jones' locker (cheers). Antonio Captain you're right, We'll settle the old dog this very night. No ; that's too late. I've a much better way, Follow my plan, we'll cook his goose to-day. Of this old meddler we've had quite enough. (Aside). Strikes me that we shall find the goose is tough. Captain Lorenzo Captain A special tip our spy this morning sends, This officer himself, with several friends, Intends to have a picnic near this spot This very afternoon. We'll bag the lot, At least, we ought to, that's all I can say, Provided they don't go some other way, And give us all the slip. 'Twould trouble save Antonio Lorenzo If we could lure the party to this cave We'd capture the whole shoot with all the swag"], [11, "7 Bere on the spot, with hardly any fag, Wipe out old scores on all this colonel's crew And teach them a sound lesson (to Capt.) What say you? The plan is good. 'Tis better than to wait, Here in this cave, to see if fickle Fate Will smile on us or no. Bring in the wine There's nothing better than the juice of vine To give us courage. Say ? We ca'nt do wrong By calling on the Captain for a song Fill up iny boys ! We've lots of time before us Captain! Let's have a song. We'll all join the Chorus. Captain Lorenzo Captain Lorenzo (Song />// the Captain) \u2014 The Brigand of Timbuctoo There once was a brigand bold, And a jolly good fellow was he ; His story I'll tell, for I knew him well, And he lived close by the sea. His name it was a curious one, And it may seem strange to you; But all the same, this robber's name Was the Brigand of Timbuctoo. Chorus \u2014 For he was a brigand bold, my lads, And brave as a lion was he. He robb'd them all, both great and small, Of high and of low degree. And in case you don't believe it I'll very soon prove to you Of robbers the chief notorious thief Was the Brigand of Timbuctoo. In a castle there dwelt a maid, A maiden with golden hair, That one day with the swag, this brigand did drag Awaj to his mountain lair. And for many a day she pined away And a skeleton quite she grew, Till she jump'd in the sea, and by death got free From the Brigand of Timbuctoo. Chorus \u2014"], [12, "8 Her father he swore an oath, 'Twas a terrible oath to hear, He vow'd he'd contrive to track to his hive This brigand whom all did fear, And as luck would have it, he soon ran him down With followers only a few, And a terrible fight they had that night With the Brigand of Timbuctoo. Chorus \u2014 Now these brigands they lost the fight, And all but their chief were slain. And with chorus and song they drag'd him along At the end of a heavy chain. And when they arrived at the castle gate Him in dungeon deep they threw, His days to spend and that was the end Of the Brigand of Timbuctoo. Chorus \u2014 (A Signal heard from outside B.) Captain Hullo ! What's that ? A signal from without. (Signal repeated). There, 'tis again ! Who is outside ? Antonio The scout. Captain Bring the scout in (to scout). Well, what have you to say? Scout Captain ! A picnic party comes this way. I was on guard down at the usual place When I espied this party coming on apace, Right up the path. In fact, they'd got so near I'd hardly time to warn you. They'll b3 here Almost directly. Captain Really ? Come that's good ! Take cover men ! Get out into the wood ! Or better still behind these rocks we'll hide, Lay low with weapons handy by your side ' Ready for use. When you the signal hear, Spring to your feet and raise a lusty cheer, Surround the party. Each select a man About your size, then do the best you can To thrash him well and soundly Give no quarter ! The swag's your share, mine the Colonel's daughter! (Exit brigands B. & L. Enter Zoriada from rocks 1st L.E.J"], [13, "9 Zoriada. The Colonel's daughter eh ? So that's his game I'm to be thrown aside for this new flame Fool that he is ! He'll find out when too late That Zoriada's love has turned to hate. His plans I'll foil. A vow too I'll redeem [Shows dagger.'] This is the weapon that will spoil his scheme. [Zoriada sings] \u2014 \" Oh ! Weil Do I Remember.' Oh well do I remember For 'twas scarce a year ago When all the world seem'd sunshine, A Paradise below, There came a handsome stranger To my father's house one day He did his best to win my heart Before he went away. I knew that he had won my heart Before he went away He came again and told me If I would be his bride That in his ship he'd take me Across the briny tide. Poor simple little maiden Was I to go so far. That day I went to see his bark A sail on every spar \u2014 That evening we were in his bark A sail on every spar. The vessel sail'd so swiftly, And soon we reached a strand Surrounded by blue mountains By balmy breezes fann'd, The birds they sang out sweetly Around us all the day This happiness I thought would last For ever and for aye, Those golden hours I thought would last For ever and for aye. But summer soon departed And then the winter came, I felt his love grow colder Twas like some dying flame, And now all hopes are shatter'd That dwelt within my breast I only live for vengeance sweet"], [14, "10 And then I'll go to rest. His life must pay the forfeit now And then I'll go to rest, Vengeance ! ! (Exit 1st B. E.) [Frank heard outside. Enter Frank. 2nd L. E.] Not here ? That's strange. I'm told they went this way The Colonel's not aware our ship's a day Before her time. 'Twill be no little sport To run across them when they think I ought To still be out at sea. I'll look well round, Frank And, if I'm not mistaken, they'll be found Not far from here. (Frank sings) \u2014 \" Never Look Down Below.\" I love the hills to climb Frank On a bright and sunny morn, Neath the azure sky from the mountain high To gaze on the rippling corn ; The sparkling waters cool, From their rocky grottos leap, And dashing away in glittering spray Are lost in the boundless deep. I love to breathe the air That comes wafting o'er the vale, While a perfume sweet with wild flow'rs replete Is borne on the gentle gale ; Still climbing above the clouds Higher and higher I'll soar, To the peaks of snow whilst down below The boiling torrents roar. Climbing, climbing, Steady now be your stride ; Climbing, climbing, High up tha mountain side. Take care, beware, As scaling the crags you go, The guides all give us this advice \u2014 \" Never look down below.\" Two years have glided by Since I left my native home, On the bosom free of the restless sea In far distant climes to roam. But mem'ry still recalls The bright day I told my love,"], [15, "11 To a maiden fair with jewels rare As we wandered beneath the grove. At length our bark's returned, She lies anchored in the bay, A trim built craft, both fore and aft, All dress'd with bunting gay. I'm seeking now for Rose Midst the mountain peaks sublime, And in search of her from spur to spur And crag to crag I'll climb. Climbing, climbing, &c. (As he is singing the last refrain. Rose and Clara enter 2nd E.E. Rose sings a few bars of refrain, then laughs ; Frank turns round, sees them, and says : \u2014 Frank 'Tis Rose ! (Crosses lo meet them). EoSE Frank, back at last !
