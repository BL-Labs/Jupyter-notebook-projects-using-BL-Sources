Thou mayejl \" now accumulate to thy f elf more riches than are to be found in the mines \" of Golconda and Peru; fee if thou canjl find felicity in abundance. F \" From"], [50, "MISCELLANIES. 34 \" From this time, whatever metal thou touchef Jhall immediately be Con \" verted into Gold.\" In concluding thefe words, he vanifhed from my fight. Tranf ported with the view of my approaching grandeur, I failed not in flantly to try the new power I was inverted, with, and found my moft fanguine wifhes completed. After filling numberlefs coffers with this precious metal, I began to deliberate how to difpofe of it, and where to lodge it in fafety. Not to difplay my wealth, was not to enjoy it ; and to emerge from obfcurity, into the glare of pomp, and the buftle of parade, would be fubjedting myfelf to fuch enquiries, as would with difficulty be furmounted. At laft, I determined, (as fancy knows no bounds) to leave my native land : I thought myfelf tranfported to one of thofe iflands known by the name of Laputa. Here I fixed my re lidence, and became the envy of the inhabitants. In order, however, to ingratiate myfelf into the efteem of the people, I failed not to diftribute large fums to the needy. The fame of my wealth and generofity reached the ear of the Prince of the ifland, and I was ordered into his prefence, to give an account of my wealth and origin* \" Tell"], [51, "MISCELLANIES. 35 \" Tell me,\" faid he, with a fevere afpect, \" who it is that furnifhes \" thee with thofe vafl fums thou expendefl in thy mode of living. Thy life \" depends on thy veracity, no fubterfuge fhall fave thee.\" Awed by his menaces, and terrified by the brightnefs of his fcymetar, which he waved over my head, I inftantly declared the truth. \" Retaining this perfon in my Court,\" faid he, turning to his Prime Minifter, \" will infallibly fecure me a conquejl over my enemies.

F 2 THOUGHTS"], [52, "MISCELLANIES. 36 Thoughts on Love and Marriage. IVOCHEFOCAULT fays, \" There are convenient marriages, but no happy ones.\" I think this obfervation fhould be confined to the French, who have more urbanity than fincerity, or confiancy. But the fafhionable English outftrip the fatire of that fevere Moralist, and do not feem to have even conveniency in view ; for to be falfe, and to feparate, is now the confequence of marriage. Sad depravity ! to fubvert the nobleft and moft probable fcheme of happinefs ever formed in this or any other government !

Firft, then, I affirm that friendfhlps between men, are often fhort and difguftful, as they are for the molt part diverted of that eafy complaifancej"], [53, "MISCELLANIES, 37 complaifance, and agreeable afTiduity, which is ever obferved between perfons of good fenfe, and different fexes : and to prove that the pleafures arising from thefe connections, are not the moft reafonable that can be had ; I need but mention how often they call in tavern exceiies, and midnight revellings, as auxiliaries to their happinefs. If thefe fentimentsare not unreafonable ; it muft follow then, that a female mind, rightly formed, is capable of giving and receiving the moft permanent and focial delight. When a man of tafte and gene rosity is joined, by an indifibluble band, to a woman of this caft, he can return to her converfation, from evenings fpent in the moft con vivial manner, and consider her fenfe, fprightlinefs, and difcretion, as pleafures higher than thofe he left. Far be it from the writer's design, (in placing the merits of her own fex in a proper light,) either to extenuate or exaggerate, the faults of thofe unthinking fair ones, who deviate from the road of Virtue in conjugal life; the firft were bafe, as no female character is more deteftable than an inconftant wife : the latter needlefs, as the lofs of Fame and Peace, is the confequence of their crimes. But there are cafes, in which the Lords of the Creation expect a conduct: from us, that they cannot perfevere in themfelves ; namely, that of reclaiming an unfaithful hufband.

Did you ever hear of a man, who thought it worth his while to reform a wife who had once fwerved from Virtue's rule ? . Yet this advice is poured upon us by every author who has wrote on the focial duties. What makes this ftep fo very improper and incovenient, but the difficulty of it ? Certain it is that fuch a ftep requires all that can be called amiable, brave, and fteady. The fol dier, who meets death in the field of battle ; meets only that, which to her would be a relief from all her fad diftrefies, injuries, and cares! It follows then, from what has been faid, that men expect from us (how circumfcribed foever our educations may be) what all their philofophy and firmnefs cannot teach them. THOUGHTS"], [55, "MISCELLANIES. 39 Thoughts on Bankruptcies. 1 THINK it fcarcely admits of a doubt, whether or no the fu perior degree of knowledge, the English have been attaining thefe two centuries, contributes in the lealt to their emolument or rectitude. Almolt every man you meet Is a flave to Ambition, and fcorns the road marked out for him by Providence. Merchants would be en nobled ! retailers of muflin would be merchants ! and pennylefs clerks would be refpedtable drapers I \" Ambition ftalks the land,'* and every man is afhamed of his character ! Domeftic happinefs is out of the queftlon ; and to figure away, feems the end and aim of the whole world. From this caufe, mar riages without affection take place ; and the tendereft connections are fuppreffed, for convenient bargains. Women of fmall experience and large fortunes, are addreffed by Men who cannot fupport their own extravagance ; but with the pecuniary affiftance of a wife's fortune, they, in time, become eminent bankrupts. Pride induces us to quit our own fpheres, but is the molt wretched companion in the world under misfortunes.. It magnifies our merits, makes"], [56, "MISCELLANIES. 40 makes us defpife kind advifers, and ftill throws us at a diftance from that happinefs we are falfely purfuing. It is amazing how few people consider, that getting, and fquandering money, are two dif ferent things. If every tradefman will expend the yearly profits of his bufinefs, what is to become of his offspring ? or how can he ar rive at the character of a wealthy trader, or the man of confequence, which he would fain be thought ? The Writer of this is not fo ignorant of the commercial world, as to fuppofe, that every failure in trade is the refult of thoughtlefs luxury ; but when the prudent, the careful, and indultrious, are in volved in calamities which belong only to the diffipated part of man kind ; the guilt of the latter becomes double, by entailing mifery on the worthy. The road to avoid thefe inconveniencles, is fo plain and eafy, that it is perfectly, artonifhing how few ftrike into it. If every one would have the wifdom and humility to trade, and appear agreeable to his fate and fortune; how fmall would be the number of thofe unhappy mortals, who exchange fafety for Jhew, and competence for wretchednefs. The"], [57, "MISCELLANIES. 41 On Female Education. IN OTHING that is fo commonly practifed, is perhaps lefs un derftood than the Education of Children. I have long been of opinion, that it would vaftly encreafe the wifdom and happinefs of this ftate, if the Legiflature was to prohibit thofe from forming the minds of Youth, who by nature, or want of education, are unfit for that important office. This, by fome, will be thought a ftrange af fertion; but let him or her, who is of this opinion, ftop a moment, and afk themfelves, what employment can be of more importance, than that which is to form the minds and manners of the people of the next age ? Lycurgus went farther than this : the Lacedemonians were not fuffered to educate their own children. That great lawgiver, who ftudied human nature as well as politics ; undoubtedly knew, that fond parents do not always fee what is for the real advantage of their children. Let it not be inferred from hence, that I think a public education now invariably necefTary ; in my opinion it is of no confequence, whether children are instructed at home or abroad, provided they are not fuffered to neglect what their parents intend they fhould learn, G and"], [58, "MISCELLANIES. 42 and that they who' are intrulted with the care of teaching them, are qualified for the undertaking. Reading, when juftly performed, Is one of thofe graces which every one is charmed with, and few attain to. The committing the rudiments of this branch to perfons who ar-e unacquainted with the powers of the human voice, even in fpeaking, is one of thofe errors^ which parents fhould carefully avoid-. For as there is a better and a worfe method of inculcating every thing, fo I would recommend. this to be much attended to. Children fhould be accuftomed to declame as foon as they can fpeak. Let them learn by rote fome interefting ftories or fhort fables^ adapted to their capacities ; but never fuffer them to repeat a line, but in the tones you judge to be proper and elegant. Some people, who have not attended to the capacities of children, may think this impracticable : on the contrary ; nothing is more eafy. Almoft every perfoii has had an opportunity of obferving, that a child of five or fix years old, with a mufical ear, will learn a. tune with great exactnefs, without the fmalleft knowledge of the principles of mufic. Why fhould the former be thought more diffi cult than this ? The proper cadence at a note of admiration, and a period, with the raising of the voice at a note of interrogation, are all"], [59, "MISCELLANIES 43 all ufed in the molt common converfation, even amongft children. It is but telling them the names of thefe tones as foon as they begin to read, and they will readily know when to ufe them. I have always found the moft difficulty in teaching the proper variation at a colon and femicolon. The former is fo nearly allied to the fall at a period, and the latter to railing the voice at a note of interrogation, that it has been only by frequently repeating thefe founds, I could make myfelf underftood. They may be compared to the halftones in mufic, which many voices are unable to make, and many ears incapable of diftinguifhing. When in this cafe I have laboured long without effect, I have generally had recourfe to fome of my boarders, and defired them to instruct the new pupils. This has generally anfwered my end ; for every child thinks it very pof fible for her to learn what feems fo eafy to another, or from a de finable emulation, is determined to accomplifh, what appears fo ac ceptable in a fchool-fellow. Would every parent who has leifure, attend to this, or fee that their offspring are placed with thofe who make it a rule to do it, they would find their children better readers at feven years of age, than thofe who are neglected in thofe points are at fourteen. G 2 In"], [60, "MISCELLANIES. 44 In the courfe of my praftice as a Governefs, out of many fcores committed to my care, from five years old to twenty, I cannot recollect that I have had ten, who knew the ufe of flops or paufes, in reading, when they came to me, and the older they were, the more difficult I found it to mellow their voices to pro per cadences. I have always endeavoured to remove, as much as poflible, at pro per feafons, that unneceffary and painful diffidence, which pupils are too apt to feel in the prefence of an inftructor. Children do not know how to feparate the ideas of a teacher and a tyrant. This is owing to the inconfideratenefs of thofe parents, who draw compari fons between what their children enjoy while in their own houfes, and the mortification they muft fuffer when placed at a boarding fchool. Every meal, perhaps, for a few preceding weeks, they are reminded what plenty they are indulged with to what they will find at fchool. Alas! how filly and impolitic is this! to fill their tender minds with terror, and draw on that backwardnefs to enter upon a courfe of education, which is the grand barrier to all im provement ! Would parents purfue a different conduct, and teach their daugh ters, to consider a governefs as a kind of fubftituted mother, whofe tendernefs will be extended to them in all that relates to their real advantage ;"], [61, "MISCELLANIES 45 advantage ; what difference would this make in the happinefs and improvement of their children ! She would not appear to them like a brow-beating pedagogue ; but as a perfon interefted in, and delighted with every thing that concerns their improvement and real welfare. Not that I would venture to affirm, that every mind is to be wrought into obedience by love alone ; fome children are too indolent and thoughtlefs to obey from motiyes of affection : neither can it be fuppofed that they can fee, in all refpects, what is for their real advantage. This, and many other reafons, make it neceffary that an instructor fhould be both feared and loved, which is very possible to be done. The ridicule my fex has long borne for their incorrect writing, makes me very defirous to cultivate a knowledge of Englifh gram- mar. In general, girls are required to learn fuch a variety of things, in a little time, and to fend home fuch a quantity of fine needle work, as leaves but few opportunities for the improvement of their mental abilities. I never found the moft copious grammars the moft ufeful ; for when young minds are once tired with the te- dioufnefs of any thing they are purfuing, nothing is fo fatal a bar to their proficiency. Fenning' s and Dil worth's fhort grammars may be repeated many times in a few weeks. Thefe well under- stood and retained, with frequently giving talks of falfe Englifh to turn into good grammar, I have found fufficient to make my pupils write"], [62, "MISCELLANIES. 46 write correctly. I am not unconfcious, that this method will hy fome be thought fuperficial ; but experience has long convinced me of its utility. The taking this fatiguing part of my icholar's education upon myfelf, was not any emolument to me : a reading mafter, (as he is generally called) attends a boarding fchool fo fhort a time, as leaves me very much in doubt, whether young ladies are much the better for his portion of instruction. What, in the name of common fenfe, can one hour or two in a day do for thirty, forty, or fifty fcholars ? WRITING. THIS is efteemed fo common and eafy a part of education, that many people would think it almoit impoflible to advance any thing new upon the fubject ; but as I have taught Writing myfelf, and have attended the errors and improvements of my pupils with a motherly anxiety, I fhall venture to mention my opinion in this matter. I think it a fatal miftake to fuffer children to write too long at a time. Writing, when properly purfued, is as much a work of imitation as drawing;' and as no perfon can copy or imitate in a true and mafterly manner when the fancy is weary, it follows, con- fequently,"], [63, "MISCELLANIES. 47 fequently, .that to write a little at a time, and frequently, is by far the belt method. One hour every day I have always found anfwer better than any other proportion of time for this employment ; nor would I permit more than ten lines to be wrote in that hour. When a young lady is never allowed to be tired of writing, Ihe always returns to it with a glee and pleafure which is invariably attended with improvement. I have kept thofe ladies whom I have taught to write at leaft a month in capitate ; it is aftonifhing what a differ ence this makes in the freedom of the writing. This method opens the fingers, and gives the hand that proper fcope which is certain to form a free and masterly hand. When a young beginner is permitted to write joining hand, It fhould be very large for fix months ; this manner of inftructing will moft alTuredly enable the learner to avoid a crampt and confined hand, which is fo much complained of in female writing. Letter writing is another branch of education, in which young people can never be taken too rnuch' pains with. I was always happy when my boarders friends required frequent letters, for nothing but conftant practice can make a perfon perfect in ortho graphy. Neither do I think a mere filial correlpondence enough for a young lady while at fchool ; I have never failed to desire a fur ther exertion of my pupils talents in this way, by giving them a a fubject"], [64, "MISCELLANIES. 48 a fubject once a week, and infilling on a letter being addreffed to myfelf, from a theme which I thought adapted to their years and capacities. From this pra&ice, much entertainment has accrued to myfelf : it was a continual fource of delight to me, to encourage the timid, and praife the ingenious. By thefe means I am certain I have called forth many latent fparks of genius, which would have lain dormant and unknown, even to the poflelTor. FRENCH. WITH refpect to young ladies learning French, it has ever been my opinon, that they fhould be allowed three or four years for the attainment of it. I do not mean to infinuate that they fhould have no other employment during that time ; but amongst other avocations, their French Ihould be carefully attended to for fome years. How many young ladies do we meet with who pretend to fpeak French, and yet do not know what a verb is in that or their native language ! Would it not be more eligible to be a proficient in one language, than a blunderer in two ? I think I Ihall have every one of good common fenfe on my fide, when I aver, that a woman who writes her mother tongue with elegance and correctnefs, is a more agreeable and ertimable character, than Ihe who knows both"], [65, "MISCELLANIES. 49 both but superficially, and would blufh at having her orthography examined. Nothing raifes us from the cares and anxieties of this fublunary world, more than a knowledge of Astronomy. When we con sider what an amazing body that immenfe globe of fire the fun is, how many worlds he enlightens, what an artonifhing force it requires to protrude each planet in its orbit, how probable it is that each fixed ltar is a fun, warming and cheating other worlds imper ceptible to us, we are loft in the contemplation of that Divine Being who is the grand Artificer of thefe works, and the eternal Father of the Univerfe ! It is a very eafy matter for a young lady to gain fuch a know ledge of this, as to exalt her ideas of the Deity, and give her a com petent understanding of the Solar fyftem, the situation of our earth and her neighbouring planets, without fearching too deeply into the fcientific parts, or fpending half her life with a pair of globes before her. MUSIC. MUSIC is now become a fcience, and is to thofe who have naturally a fine ear, the moft pleasing and entertaining part of Edu cation ; it rewards us as we go on, by a delightful aflemblage of H founds,"], [66, "MISCELLANIES, 50 founds, which, agreeable to Milton's mode of cxpreffion, \" takes the' \" wrapt foul, and laps it in Elyfium !\" For thofe who have for tune and leifure, there cannot be a more rational and innocent amufement. Though I have taught the guitar many years, yet I think the harpsichord is an inftrument which every lady fhould pre fer to it, whofe friends are willing to be at the expence of a mufic mafter three or four years. But a young lady may have a mufical ear, and an agreeable voice, who has not fo much time to. fpare for this purpofe ; in this cafe, I think the guitar not only proper but defirable, as it is very poffible, with a good ear and due attention, to learn to play well in three or four months. I have not faid thus much in favour of the guitar, from a fuppofition that any emolu ment will ever arife to myfelf, as I teach it gratis to my pupils. DANCING. DANCING I fcarcely need enlarge upon, as it is almort impof fible to be eicher graceful or genteel without fome inftruction in this art ; but care fhould be taken that too much time fhould not be expended in it by thofe pupils who are to continue but a few years at fchool. It is not necesTary that every lady fhould dance like Madam Heinel, or Simonette. To dance a minuet with eafe, or join in a cotillion or country dance with facility, is sufficient for moft ladies both before and after marriage. This occafioiss."], [67, "MISCELLANIES. 51 s occafions me to mention a thought that has often occurred to me. When a fond and tender mother brings her child to be educated by a governefs, whofe morals and abilities fhe entertains a high opinion of, would it be improper or impertinent for the latter to alk the former this plain and ufeful quefHon : Would you have your daughter, Madam, an accomplished fine lady ; or do you wifh her to be an excellent houfewife, and a ufeful member of fo ciety ? It will take a great deal more time and money to form the firft than the fecond character. If every parent would be candid enough to own their views in life for their children, time and ex pence would not be thrown away, which is fometimes the cafe, for want of fuch an ingenuous conduct as I have here recommended.
