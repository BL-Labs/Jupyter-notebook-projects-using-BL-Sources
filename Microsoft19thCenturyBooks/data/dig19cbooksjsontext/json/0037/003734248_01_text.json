No work having been published on Anieriea recently, it occurred to the author, whilst on a journey through Canada and the United States, last year, that, from the great change which the New World has undergone lately, recent information on the state of the country, and on subjects generally interesting to readers in Great. Britain, got up in a style practically useful as well as instructive, might be acceptable at the present time. To render 6iich a work as interesting as possible, and at the same time assist him to more clearly illustrate some of the physical as well as a few of the social features of tlie country, the author has availed himself of the assistance of the Artist, Photographer, and Engraver, as he felt that any words of his own would fall short of doing that justice to the subjects and places which he was desirous of noticing. To preserve as far as possible all the truthful details of the photographic views \u2014 from which many of the illustrations which appear are taken \u2014 the author has had them re-pho tographed upon wood by Price's new patent process, so that the engravers have been enabled to present exact representations of every scene taken from such ; consequently, he feels confidence in submitting them for public approval. To describe all the places noticed, from the author's own observations, was impossible in the time at his disposal. Consequently, a portion of what appears has been compiled from some of the most reliable sources, wich the view of rendering the work more complete than it would otherwise have been. As, however, he is now in the course of visiting other localities in the United States, he will be able to present such, at a future time, from his own observations and experien _e, together with some other articles on \" Things as they are,\" and illustrations which were not ready in time for this publication. For easy reference, this work has been divided into five parts, with an index preceding the contents of each part. Part First, contains descriptions and illustrations of some of the principal cities on the Atlantic seaboard, and north-western States of the United States. Part Second, entitled \" Scenes and Scenery,\" is intended to illustrate some of the most remarkable objects and places of interest in the United States and Canada."], [14, "10 TO THE READER. Part Tmito relates to Canada, with descriptions and illustrations of the principal cities and towns, and information useful for tourist-, emigrants, and others travelling to any part of the province. Part Four\u2122 contains notes connected with the public and social institutions, commerce. manufactures, customs, manners, and every day life, in the United States and Canada. Part Fifth refers to subjects chiefly interesting to emigrants and agriculturists, who are either desirous of ascertaining information as to the present position and prospects of the country, or who think of emigrating thither. The author makes no claim for literary excellence in the pages which he has written. but to a sincere desire to present the information in an intelligible, unbiassed, and disin terested manner; and although some of the subjects noticed have been treated by others with much greater ability than he has done, still they are inserted here to render tin work as complete as possible, and, by the introduction of articles on subjects not generally noticed by writers on America, he trusts that, taken as a whole, they will be found worthy of perusal."], [15, "|p art Jfirsl UNITED STATES.

In 177-1, he was sent to the Continental Congress, and was appointed commandef-in-chief of the Ameri can army, and served through the Revolution, refusing to receive any pay for his services, and only reimbursement of his expenses. In 1787, he was appointed a delegate to the national convention for forming the Constitution, and was chosen its president. In 1789, he was unanimously elected President of the United States for 1 years, and unanimously re-elected in 1793. He declined a third re-election, and issued his farewell address. After Mr. Adams's inauguration, he retired to Mount Vernon, near Washington City, D. C, where he died on the 14th of December, 1799, in the 68th year of his age.

This confederation, consist ing originally of thirteen States, but now of thirty-one States, the federal district, and sev eral territorial appendages, lies between the parallels of 24\u00b0 and 49\u00b0 north latitude, and the meridians of 10\u00b0 east and 48\u00b0 west from Washington, or 67\u00b0 and 125\u00b0 from Greenwich, ex tending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and from the British .jlonies on the north, to the Republic of Mexico and the great Gulf on the south. The whole extent of this boundary is now definitely settled by treaty. The greatest width of this country, from east to we6t, is 2900 miles, and the greatest depth, from north to south, 1730 miles. Its area may be estimated at 3,260,000 square miles, including California, Texas, etc., recently acquired. It has a frontier of about 10,000 miles, of which 4400 is sea-coast, and 1500 lake coast. Its shores are washed by three seas, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, the Gulf of Mexico on the south, and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Tlie principal bays aud sounds on the Atlantic border are Passamaquoddy Bay, which lies between the State of Maine and the British province of New Brunswick ; Massachusetts Bay, between Cape Ann and Cape Cod ; Long Island Sound, between Long Island and the coast of Connecticut ; Delaware Bay, which sets up between Cape May and Cape Henlopen, separating the States of New Jersey and Delaware ; Chesapeake Lay, which communicates with the ocean between Cape Charles and Cape Henry, extending in a northern direction for 200 miles, through the States of Virginia and Maryland ; Albemarle Sound and Painlico Sound, on the coast of North Carolina, There are no large bays or sounds on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. On the Pacific coast, however, there are several excellent bays, but the principal and only one necessary to mention is the Bay of San Francisco, in the State of California. It is one of the finest bays iu the world, and capable of containing the navies of all the European powers at one time. MOUNTAINS. Tlie territory of the United States is traversed by two principal chains of mountains, the Alleghanies on the east side, and the Rocky Mountains on the west These divide the country into three distinct regions, the Atlantic slope, the valley of the Mississippi, and the declivity from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific. The Alleghanies are less a chain of mountains than a long plateau, crested with several chains of mountains or hills, separated from each other by wide and elevated valleys. East of the. Hudson the mountains are chiefly granitic, with rounded summits, often cov ered at their tops with bog and turf, and distributed in irregular groups without any marked direction. Some peaks of the Green Mountains in Vermont, and the White Moun tains in New Hampshire, rise to the height of 5000 to 6400 feet above the sea. After pass ing the Hudson, the structure of the mountains seems to change. In Pennsylvania and Virginia they assume the form of long parallel ridges, varying in height from 2500 to 4000 feet, and occupying a breadth of 100 miles. In North Carolina the highest culmination is 6476 feet; but in the northern part of Georgia and Alabama, where they terminate, they again lose the form of continuous chains, and break into groups of isolated mountains, touching at their base, some of which attain a considerable elevation. The Rocky Mountains are on a much grander scale than the Alleghanies. Their base is 300 miles in breadth, and their loftiest summits, covered with everlasting snow, rise to the height of 10 to 14,000 feet. These vast chains may be considered as a continuation of the Cordilleras of Mexico. They are distant from the Pacific Ocean from 500 to 600 miles, but between them and the coast, several minor ranges intersect the country, of which the Mari time Range is the most conspicuous."], [20, "18 ELEVATIONS AND RIVERS.

The principal rivers of the United States may be divided into four classes. First, the Mississippi and its wide-spread branches, which drain the waters of the whole country in cluded between the Alleghany and Rocky Mountains; second, the rivers east of the Alle ghany Mountains, which, rising from their eastern declivity, water the Atlantic plain, and hence flow into the ocean ; third, the system of rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, which may be subdivided into those flowing from the southern slope of the Alleghanies, and those having their source in the north-western highlands of Texas; and, fourth, those streams on the west of the Rocky Mountains, which flow into the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi rises west of Lake Superior, in latitude 47\u00b0 47' north, amid lakes and swamps, dreary and desolate beyond description ; and after a south-east course of about 500 miles, reaches the Falls ofthe St. Anthony, where it descends perpendicularly 16 feet, and where are numerous rapids. From these falls it pursues, at first, a south-easterly, and then a southerly direction ; and after forming the boundary between Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas on the west, and Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi on the east, passes through Louisiana, and discharges itself through a delta of many mouths into the Gulf of Mexico. It is nearly 3200 miles in length, and is navigable, with few obstruc tions, to the Falls of St. Anthony. Its principal tributaries from the east are : \u2014 1. The Wisconsin, which joins it between the parallels 42\u00b0 and 43' north latitude. 2. The Ulinois, a navigable river, which joins it near latitude 38\u00b0 and 40' north. 3. The Ohio, which is itself formed by the junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburg. It flows in a south-westerly direction for 945 miles, separating the north-western States from Virginia and Kentucky, and falls into the Mississippi, in 37\u00b0 north latitude. The chief tributaries of the Ohio are the Wabash, the Cumberland, and the Ten nessee, which last is formed of several streams from the western parts of Virginia and the Carolinas, which unite a little west of Knoxville, in the State of Tennessee, and runs, at first, south-west into Alabama, where it turns and runs north-west, through Tennessee into Kentucky, and joins the Ohio 10 miles below the mouth of the Cumberland. 4. The Yazoo, which rises in the northern part of the State of Mississippi, and, running south-west, joins the Mississippi 100 miles above Natchez. The tributaries from the west are: \u2014 1. The Minnesota, or St. Peter's, which joins it about 9 miles below the Falls of St. An thony, after a south-east course of several hundred miles. 2. The Des Moines, which joins it near the parallel of 40\u00b0 north latitude, after a south easterly course of more than 800 miles. 3. The Missouri, which is formed by three branches, called Jefferson's, Madison's, and Gallatin's Rivers, all of which rise and unite in the Rocky Mountains. The whole length, from the highest point of Jefferson's River, to the confluence with the Mississippi, is, by actual course, about 2500 miles, and to the Gulf of Mexico about. 4350 miles ; during the whole of which distance there is no cataract or considerable impediment to the navigation,"], [21, "RIVERS IN THE UNITED STATES. 19 except at Great Falls, which are ab ove 2000 miles from the Mississippi. At r,hese falls the river descends, in the distance of 1 8 miles, 362 feet. The principal tributaries of the Missouri are the Yellow Stone, which rises in the Rocky Mountains, and joins it after a north-east ly course of 600 miles ; the Nebraska or Platte, which rises also in those mountains, and, after an easterly course of 800 miles, joins the Missouri in latitude 41\u00b0 north; and the Kansas, which joins it near latitude 39\u00b0 north, after an easterly course of more than 600 miles. Probably no district in the United States will shortly be attracting the attention of settlers, if not already doing so, than portions of the vast region connected with the Mis souri River and Valley. The opening of the great Pacific mail route last October, will tend very materially to the development of that portion of the country, which is found to be suitable for colonization. The route referred to now joins St. Louis (Missouri) with San Francisco, (California,) or in other words, forming a continuous chain of rapid communica tion from the shores of the Pacific Ocean to those of the Atlantic \u2014 the great barrier of the Rocky Mountains, and the dreary wastes of its \" bad lands,\" forming no longer any impedi ment to the determination of American enterprise. The time occupied by the mail route referred to is 25 days. 4. The Arkansas, which rises in the Rocky Mountains, and pursuing a south-easterly course, forms, for some distance, the boundary between the Indian Territory and Texas; after which, its course lies principally in the State of Arkansas, till it joins the Mississippi in 34\u00b0 north latitude. Its length is more than 1300 miles. 5. Tlie Red River, which also rises in the Rocky Mountains, below Sante \u00a56, and, after a south-easterly course of more than 1000 miles, falls into the Mississippi, in latitude 31\u00b0 north. The principal rivers east of the Alleghanies are: \u2014 1. The Connecticut, which rises in the highlands separating the United States from Can ada, and, running southerly, divides New Hampshire from Vermont, and passing through Massachusetts and Connecticut, falls into Long Island Sound. It is navigable for sloops for 50 miles to Hartford, and, by means of canals and other improvements, has been rendered passable for boats 250 miles further. 2. The Hudson, which rises west of lake Champlain, and pursuing a southerly course of more than 300 miles, falls into the Bay of New York, after receiving numerous affluents. It is navigable for ships to Hudson, 130 miles, and for sloops and steamboats to Troy, 40 miles farther. It is connected with Lakes Champlain, Erie, and Ontario, by means of canals from Albany, and with the Delaware by a canal from Rondout. 3. The Delaware, which rises in New York, and flowing southerly, separates Pennsyl vania from New York and New Jersey, and falls into Delaware Bay, after a course of 300 miles. It is navigable for ships of the line 40 miles, to Philadelphia, and for sloops 35 miles farther, to the head of the tide at Trenton Falls. 4. The Susquehanna, which also rises in New York, and, pursuing a southerly zig-zag course through Pennsylvania, falls into the head of Chesapeake Bay, near the north-east corner of Maryland. During the last 50 miles the navigation is obstructed by an almost continued series of rapids. 5. The Potomac, which rises in the Alleghanies, and after forming, during its whole course, the boundarj between Maryland and Virginia, falls into Chesapeake Bay. It is navigable for ships of the largest dimensions to Washington, the federal capital, about 200 miles from the ocean ; but in the upper part of its course there are numerous obstacles, many of which, however, have been overcome by canals. 6. James River, which rises in the mountains, and falls into the southern part of Chesa peake Bay. 7. The Savannah, which forms the dividing line between South Carolina and Georgia. and falls into the Atlantic in latitude 32\u00b0 north. It is navigable for large vessels to Savan nah, 17 miles; and for boats to Augusta, 130 miles farther. The principal rivers which rise south of the Alleghanies, and fall into the Gulf of Mexico, are: \u2014"], [22, "20 RIVERS IN AMERICA. 1. The Appalachicola, which discharges itself into Apalachee Bay, in Florida. It is formed by the union of the Chattahooche and Flint rivers, the former of which rises in the northern part of Georgia, and flowing south, receives the Flint at the south-west extremity of the State. During the latter part of its course, the Chattahooche forms the boundary between Georgia and Alabama. 2. The Mobile, which discharges itself into Mobile Bay. It is formed by two large rivers, the Alabama and Tombigbee, which unite near latitude 31\u00b0 north, after having pursued each a separate course of many hundred miles. There is another system of rivers flowing into the Gulf from the highlands of northern Texas, consisting of the Sabine, Trinity, Brazos, etc., which need only be mentioned here, as the geography of Texas will be minutely de scribed elsewhere. The rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, consist of: \u2014 1. The Columbia, which rises near latitude 55\u00b0 north, and, running south-west, falls into the ocean in latitude 46\u00b0 15', after a course of 1500 miles. Its principal tributaries are Clark's River, Lewis' River, and the Multnomah or Willamette, all of which join it on its left bank. This river was discov ered in 17 92, and settlements were made in the neighbour hood by Americans in 1810. The mouth of the river is obstructed by flats, but vessels of 300 tons can ascend to the distance of 125 miles, and large sloops farther. 2. The Sacramento and San Joaquin, emptying into the Bay of San Francisco. 3. The Buenaventura, rising in the coast range of the California Mountains, empties into Monterey Bay. 4. The Colorado, and River Gila (which separates Mexico from the United States), flow from the mountains near Santa Feb and would, if not received by the Gulf of California, empty into the Pacific; they belong, however, to the same system of rivers. 5. The St. Lawrence. Particulars regarding tl is river, which forms the boundary be tween the United States and Canada, will be found in another portion of this work.

With the exception of Michigan and Champlain, none of the great lakes of North Amer ica lie wholly within the territory of the United States ; the others are on the northern With the exception of Michigan and Champlain, none of the great lakes of North Amer ica lie wholly within the territory of the United States ; the others are on the northern boundary, where they form a connected chain, extending through a distance of more than 1200 miles. The first in the chain is Lake Superior, the largest body of fresh water on the globe. Few persons are really aware of the magnitude of these great lakes ; they are truly inland seas, and navigation is as dangerous, and subjected to all the vicissitudes which are connected with the navigation of the Baltic, the Black Sea, or the Mediterranean. Lake Champlain, lying between Vermont and New York, is 128 miles long, and from 1 to 16 miles wide, and discharges its waters through the Sorel into the St. Lawrence. It is computed that the lakes contain above 14,000 cubic miles of water-\u2014 a quantity more than five-sevenths of all the fresh water on the earth. The extent of country drained by the lakes, from the north-western angle of Superior to the St. Lawrence, including also the area of the lakes themselves, is estimated at 335,515 square miles."], [23, "LAKES \u2014 GOVERNMENT OF UNITED STATES. 21 The following is a tabular statement of the extent of these fresh- water seas, with the mean depth of their waters, and their elevation above the sea : \u2014 Barnes, Mean Length.

TnE government of the United States is a federal democratic Republic. It is based on the Constitution of 1787, and amendments thereto. The electors of the most numerous branch of the several State Legislators are qualified electors in the States respectively for all elective officers of the general government. All legislative powers are vested in Congress, which consists of a Senate and House of Representatives. The \" House of Representatives\" (occupying the position of \" House of Commons\" of Britain) is composed of members chosen, every second year, by the people of the several States, and in number in accordance with the population of each, and in order to ascertain the number each State is entitled to, a census is taken every ten years, excluding from the enumeration for this object two-thirds of the slaves, and all Indians not taxed. Each State is entitled to at least one representative. Vacancies are filled by intermediate elections. The House ehooses its speaker and other officers. No person under 25 years of age, who has been less than seven j'ears a citizen of the United States, and who is not a resident of the State electing him, is qualified for representative. The Constitution provided for a specific number of representatives from each State to compose the House until the ascertainment of the population under the census of 1790 ; but since then legislation has decennially fixed the number to be elected. From the 3d of March, 1793, the apportionment was one representative to every 33,000 of the representa tive population ; after 1803, one to every 33,000 also; after 1813, one to every 35,000; after 1823, one to every 40,000; after 1833, one to every 47,000; after 1843, one to every 70,680; and after 3d of March, 1853, 233 representatives to be divided pro rata to the sev eral States. In addition to these representatives from States, the House admits a delegate from each organized territory, who has the right to debate on subjects in which his territory is inter ested, but cannot vote. California has two members by a special act. The \" Senate\" (or Upper House) consists of two members from each State, elected by the Legislatures thereof respectively for six years. One-third the whole body is renewed bien nially, and if vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the Legis lature of any State, the executive of such State makes a temporary appointment until the next meeting of the Legislature, which fills such vacancy. Senators must be at least thirty years old, must have been citizens of the United States for nine years, and be residents of the State by which chosen. Each senator has one vote. The Vice-President of the United States is ex officio President of the Senate, but a president pro tempore is elected by and from among the senators, who, in the absence of the president, acts in his stead. The Constitutional government went into operation on the 4th of March, 1789, but a quorum of the first Congress, which met at the city of New York, was not formed until the 6th of April, nor was the first President of the United States inaugurated before the 30th of April. Besides its ordinary legislative capacity, the Senate is vested with certain judicial func tions, and its members constitute a High Court of Impeachment. No person ean be con victed by this court unless on the finding of a majority of senators, nor does judgment ex-"], [24, "22 PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES. tend further than to removal from office and disqualification. Representatives have the sole power of impeachment. The Executive Power is vested in a President, who is elected by an Electoral College, chosen by popular vote, or by the Legislature of the State, the number of electors being equal to the number of senators and representatives from the States to Congress. His term of office is four years, but he is eligible for re-election indefinitely. The electors forming the college, are themselves chosen in the manner prescribed by the laws of the several States. A majority of the aggregate number of votes given, is necessary to the election of President and Vice-president, and if none of the candidates has such a majority, then tlie election of President is determined by the House of Representatives, and that of the Vice- President by the Senate, from among the three candidates having the highest number of electoral votes, and in doing so, the vote is taken by States, the representatives of each State having only one vote, which must, of course, be determined by a majority of their number. No person can be President or Vice-President who is not a native-born citizen, of the age of thirty-five years, and who has been a resident of the United States for fourteen years. The President is commander-in-ehief of the army and navy, and of the militia when in the service of the Union. With the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senate, he has the power to make treaties, appoint civil and military officers, levy war, conclude peace, and do all that rightly belongs to the Executive Power. He has a veto on all laws passed by Congress, but so qualified, that notwithstanding his disapproval, any bill becomes a law on its being afterward approved of by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress. The Presi dent has a salary of $25,000 per annum, and \" the White House\" at Washington for a resi dence, during his official term. The Vice-President is ex officio President of the Senate; and in case of the death, resignation, or other disability of the President, the powers and duties of that office devolve upon him for the remainder of the term for which the Presi dent had been elected. In case of the disability of the Vice-President, the President of the Senate pro tempore takes his place. The present President is the Hon. James Buchanan.

He is not a man of intensity and enthusiasm, like Jackson and Clay, but is cool, self-possessed, careful, non-committal and prudent, like Van Buren; more disposed to go with circum stances than to stop forth and control and mould them on the basis of his own will. He was born in the county of Franklin, Pennsylvania, of comparatively humble, but honest and industrious parents. Although he obtained a classical and academical educa tion, he may be called the architect of his own fortune.

After his return from Russia he was elected to the Senate, to which he was twice re-elected, and, in 1845, filled the first seat, as Secretary of State, in the Cabinet of the Polk administration.

Each of these presides over a separate department. The \" Department of State\" was created by an Act of Congress of the 15th .of September, 1789 ; by a previous Act of the 27th of July, 1789, it was denominated the Department of Foreign Affairs. It embraced, until the establishment of the Department of the Interior in 1849, what in some other governments are styled the Department of Foreign Affairs and Home Department; but the duties now being divided, it confines its operations almost en tirely to foreign matters, and hence its original title might, with propriety and convenience, be restored. The Secretary of State conducts all treaties between the United States and foreign pow ers, and corresponds officially with the public ministers of the government at foreign courts, and with ministers of foreign powers, resident in the United States. He is intrusted with the publication of all treaties with foreign powers, preserves the originals of all treaties and of the public correspondence growing out of international intercourse ; grants passports to American citizens visiting foreign States, etc. He has charge of the Great Seal of the United States, but cannot affix it to any commission until signed by the President, nor to any instrument without authority of the President. Salary of Secretary of State, $6,000 per annum (\u00a31200 stg.) This department has subject to it the Diplomatic Bureau, and the Consular Bureau. The United States are represented by Ministers Plenipotentiary at the Courts of Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, and Chili ; by Commission ers at the Court of Pekin (China), and at the Saudwich Islands ; by a Minister Resident at the Sublime Porte, and to the Swiss Confederation, and at other courts by Charges des Af faires ; and United States' Consuls are stationed at all the important commercial ports in the world. Foreign Ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, are En voys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary from Great Britain, Russia, the Argen tine Republic, France, Spain, Chili, Nev Grenada, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru ; Ministers Resident from Portugal, Prussia, and Belgium ; and Charges des Affaires from Denmark, Austria, Holland, Sweden, Naples, Sardinia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Foreign Consuls from all commercial nations reside in the several collection districts of the Union. The \" Department of the Interior\" was established by an Act of Congress of tho 30th of March, 1849. The Secretary of the Interior is intrusted with the supervision and management of all matters connected with the public domain, Indian affairs, pen sions, patents, public buildings, the census, the penitentiary of the District of Columbia, the expenditures of the Federal Judiciary, etc. Each of these interests is managed in a separate bureau or office, the immediate head of which is styled Commissioner, Superin tendent, or Warden, as the case may be. Salary of Secretary of Interior, $6000 per annum (\u00a31200 stg.) The \" Department of the Treasury\" was created by an Act of Congress of the 2d of Sep tember, 1789. The Secretary of the Treasury superintends all the fiscal concerns of the gov ernment, and upon his own responsibility recommends to Congress measures for improving the condition of the revenue.

As may be known by many, New York was discovered in 1609, by an Englishman named Henry Hudson, at that time in the service of the Dutch \u2014 and in 1613, the settlement of the Island was commenced, under the title of New Amsterdam. In 1621, a"], [30, "26 CITY OF XEW YORK \u2014 LOCALITIES \u2014 BUSINESS, ETC. Dutch West India company commenced opera tions upon it, and in I626, purchased the whole island from the Indians (the Manhattans) for the paltry sum of \u00a725, (\u00a35 stg.) the exports alone that year amounting to $1900. It was thus held till 16*34. when it was taken by the English. Charles the 2d, then king, changed its name to that of New York, in honour of James the 2d, who then bore the title of Duke of York and Albany. In 1686, James the 2d, then king, abolished the representative system, and, as affording one of the numerous proofs of his kingly bigotry, took it into his head to pro hibit the use of the printing-press. It was retaken from the English by the Dutch in 1673, retaken again in 1674 by the English, aud held by them till the Revolutionary period of 1776-1783, when it was finally evacuated by the British army, thus ending British rule on the 25th November, 1783. In 1812-13, another war broke out between Great Britain and Amer ica, but not leading to New York changing hands once more. Notwithstanding, therefore, wars, fevers, tires, great commercial disasters, cholera, etc., etc., the city has gone on progres sively, from a population of 23,614 in 1786, to upwards of 600,000 in 1859. Nev York is situated upon what is called Manhattan Island \u2014 a strip of laud 1SJ- miles long, by one mile and three-fifths average width. Greatest breadth, at 83d street, is two miles and one-third. In all, about 22 square miles, or 14,000 acres. It rises gradually above the level of the water around the sides, whilst the greater part of it is level, or been rendered so. It is very compactly built upon for about 5 miles, in straight lines from the point at the Battery- end of it. The streets, for the most part, are laid out in a convenient aud easily un derstood plan. The streets commencing at Houston street, (one mile from the City Hall,) are classed into 14 regular \"avenues,\" as they are called, which are crossed at right angles by 156 streets, numerically designated. Some of the streets are crooked and narrow, but gene rally speaking, they are wide and spacious \u2014 ranging from 60 to 120 feet wide. The greatest fault a stranger is likely to find with the streets is tbe filthy state the most of them are in \u2014 as if there were neither scavengers nor paviours in the city. New \"i ork is bounded on the north by the Harlem River \u2014 which separates Manhattan Is land from the mam land ; ou the east by the East River, which separates it from Long Island ; on the south by the harbour, and on the west by the North, or Hudson River, which sepa rates it from New Jersey. The width of the East River is from one-third to half a mile, and thai of the North River from 1 to l\u00a3 miles. Navigation is open throughout all the year. There ean be no doubt but that the harbour of New York is one of the most beautiful in the world \u2014 presenting one of the finest spectacles on a fine day \u2014 with its piers crowded with ships of all nations \u2014 the numbers of clean-looking steamers passing up and down, and the beauty \\ of the scenery on the opposite shores, and on every side. The defences are placed at the Narrows \u2014 on Long Island side, and on Staten Island \u2014 and in the East River at Throg's Neck ; whilst within the harbour are batteries on Bedloe's and Ellis Islands, Governor's Island, Castle William, and South Battery \u2014 commanding every point of en trance. We may safely say, that nearly every I branch of manufactures is carried on in New York, excepting iu the great items of cotton and wool \u2014 whilst its commerce extends to ev ery corner of the American continent, as well as* all over the world, wherever the natural products of the earth, or manufactures, are to be bought, sold, or exchanged. The public buildings are very numerous. We annex a list elsewhere, together with engravings of a few of the principal ones, together with a list of such places of interest and amusement as the stran ger will be pleased in visiting. The streets where the private residences are, are elegant in the extreme. We allude more particularly to such as 4th and 5th Avenues, and Union and Madison Squares, where the most stately mansions will be found, finished oif in first-rate style, mostly built of a brown coloured stone. In summer, with the rows of trees along each side of the streets, their line appearance will at once attract the admiration ot the stranger. The principal street for bankers, insurance offices, etc., is Wall street \u2014 the Lombard street of America. For wholesale dry goods stores \u2014 Pearl, Wil liam, Broad, Pine, Cedar, Liberty streets, Col lege Place, and Vesey street. For wholesale grocers, aud commission and shipping merchants \u2014 Water and Front streets. >or heavy dry goods and variety stores, Grand and Catharine streets. For hardware \u2014 Beekman, Platt, John aud Pearl streets. For booksellers and publishers, binderies, etc. \u2014 Nassau and William Streets. For Jewellers \u2014 Maiden lane, Courtland street, and Broadway. For boot and shoe materials, Ferry, Jacob, and Gold streets.

Notwithstanding this, however, the immense shipping business of the port of New York is carried on somehow \u2014 the ingenuity of the Americans finding ways aud means to clear their vessels with promptitude and ease.

High Bridge.\u2014 Connected with the water sup plv of New York, we give ihe above engraving of the Aqueduct, over which the water is brought in pipes into the city to the great reservoir at 80th st from Croton River nearly 40 miles oft. By this means, New York is supplied by an abun dant, and never-failing stream of the best water which can be desired. It is brought to a re ceiving reservoir, on York Hill, about 5 miles from the Citv Hall. The quantity capable of being supplie'd and distributed, is GO millions of gallons in one day. The Bridge, represented above, crosses the Harlem Valley and River, and is 1450 feet long. There are 8 arches, with a span of 80 feet each, springing from piers 20 feet wide, at the spring line which is 60 feet above the surface of the river, at high water. There are several other arches, springing from the ground, of 50 leet The whole works, in connection with bring ing the water bv this means to the city, has cost upwards of $15,000,000 (\u00a32,400,000 stg.). Across the East River is the suburban city of Brooklyn, where thousands ofthe New York merchants, and others, reside. The ferry-boats cross every three or four minutes. From Brook lyn \" Heights,\" some of the finest views of New York and neighbourhood are obtained. Brook lyn is governed bv a mayor, and a board of 18 aldermen\u2014 publishes daily newspapers, and has about it all the characteristics of a city, although it forms, in reality, only a suburb of the great \" Gotham,\" with which it is so closely allied.

PHELAN'S BILLIARD-TABLE ROOMS, BROADWAY."], [47, "NEW YORK STREETS \u2014 CORPORATION AND POLICE. 43 KEW YOKE STREETS AND CORPORATION. One of the worst things connected with New York, which strikes a stranger at once on his coming either from Great Britain, or such a city as Philadelphia or Boston, is the abominably disgraceful state which the public streets are in, for the most part. It matters not whether it is fine a day or foul day, there the gutters reek with stagnant water and filth to such an extent, that we are only surprised that the mortality is not greater than it is in New York, although, who can doubt but that that has something to do with the great mortality which takes place among yonng children, compelled as they are, to in hale the poisonous miasma from stagnant dirty water, etc., before the doors. Again, in the paving of the streets, they are equally bad. With the exception of such as Broad wiy, there is scarcely a 6treet in New York, but in driving along which you have to be very careful, or either the springs of your machine will snap, or you will be pitched out, owing to the ruts, holes, and stones laying about The condition of the public streets of New York \u2014 as regards scavengering and paving \u2014 are at present, and we believe long have been, a standing memorial of an effete, or disgracefully disregardless corporation. Ask any one, high or low, rich or poor, as to why it is so, and you will get the one universal answer \u2014 \" We are swindled out of the money which ought to keep the streets in better order. Instead of paying to do that, it finds its way into the pockets of a corrupt corporation.\" We could scarcely believe such to be possible, but \" what every body says must be true.\" We are so far glad, however, to be borne out in these remarks by a quotation which we make from the New York Daily Herald, the editor of which paper (20th September, 1858) appears to be indignant, when, in referring to the enormous taxation of the city, he says: \u2014 \" In return for the vast expenditure of $10,000,000, the citizen gets comparatively little advantage ; over 3,000,000 of it goes into the pockets of a set of thieving officials, small politicians, rowdies, and fighting men ; filthy streets, with the germ of pestilence in every gutter ; schools so inadequate to the population, that, 10,000 children are refused admittance in one week ; a police department so grossly mismanaged that life is continually in danger, and property almost wholly unprotected; a city government more abominably corrupt and inefficient than any other on the face of the globe \u2014 these are the benefits which the citi zens of New York get for all the money that is squandered and plundered every year. And such comments will remain true of the condition of this city until its government is taken out of the hands of dishonest politicians.\" And again, talking of the taxpayers, says: \u2014 \" They are the sufferers from all our corporation corruptions \u2014 they are the parties who are fleeced by the robbers and jobbers of all the rotten cliques and parties in the field ; and the wrongs of the taxpayers can only be righted by themselves. They can clean out our tieasury suckers if they will, and a half dozen men may put the ball in motion. Will no body take the hint, and move in this important matter of reducing the fees and perquisites of our corporation sharks and jobbers to the extent of $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 a year ? Can any man enumerate the loafers and vagabonds now subsisted out of the pockets of the tax payers, but who would be driven to honest labour, or driven out of the city, if our corpo ration expenses were cut down to the extent of some $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 a year? POLICE OF NEW YORK. From what we have seen and heard of this body, their efficiency or discipline is very questionable, when compared with the well-regulated system of any of the British cities. The policeman of New York is apparently a very gentlemanly man, and will be found now and then at corners of streets, etc, dressed up with blue frock coat, and white pants, with blue cloth cap (in summer). If you ask him a question, regarding your way to any particular point, perhaps"], [48, "POLICE OF NEW YORK \u2014 DINING SALOONS. 44 he will withdraw the cigar from his mouth, and give you a quiet, civil answer; or he will answer you with the cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth, as he stands enjoying his \" weed,\" and it may be, he answers not over civilly, and rather carelessly. It is, how ever, in the catching of pickpockets, for example, where we have seen him shine, to posi tive disadvantage \u2014 when in having some \" rowdy\" pointed out to him to secure, he would (cigar in mouth) give chase, and possibly run after his game for probably 100 yards \u2014 when, either fancying it too mnch trouble, or from some other cause, he wonld give up the chase, and be laughed at by the bystanders, as well as by the scoundrel he was in pursuit of. We need not say what tlie effect of such an exhibition must be, upon the more vicious members of society, when they see such laxity in apprehensions. Compare this with the determined vigilance, courage, and perseverance of a London policeman, who, in such cir cumstances, would chase his man from Hammersmith to Bow, rather than be defeated, once he had started in pursuit. The case we have mentioned, as regards New York police men, is only what we have borne witness to, (in what is termed the \" mayor's squad,\") and is a sample, from what we hear, of the efficiency of the protectors of the public safety and peace \u2014 who are elected to their situations, it is affirmed, more to serve private or political interest, than with an eye to the efficiency of the public service. The inefficiency of the police of New York cannot be better illustrated than by reference to the fact of murders, robberies, burglaries, assaults, etc., taking place, daily and nightly, without the offenders being brought to justice \u2014 together with the fact, that almost the whole of the large stores and factories are obliged to have private watchmen, during the night, to protect their property. Notwithstanding all the wealth, intelligence, and experience which exists in New York, we are surprised that such a want of protection to person and property exists, in the sys tem, at present, which assimilates to that in existence in London 100 years ago. DINING SALOONS, ETC. No city is better off than New York for the conveniences it affords for men of business and the thousands of assistants of all kinds, as well as strangers, getting a good, comfort able, and economical dinner. Much as Manchester may boast of its \" Merchant's,\" in Mar ket street; London, of its \" Gresham,\" in Aldermanbury; Glasgow, of its \" McLeary's\" or \" Pippett's;\" or Liverpool, of its \" Anderson's\" or the \" Crooked Billet,\" the stranger, when he becomes acquainted where to go, in New York, can dine better there, for less money, than in any of the cities referred to. The dining saloons are conducted on the same style as those in Manchester, where the system of tickets are given by the waiter, stating the amount you have to pay as you retire. There are printed bills of fare, and an immense variety of eatables and edibles are there mentioned, with the price stated opposite each. For example, you can have a plate of soup, roast mutton, potatoes, bread, butter, pickles, and pudding for 29 cents, or Is. 2-\u00a3a_ \u2014 information, perhaps, worth knowing by the stranger who has not much money to spend. Strangers, on arriving in New York, will do well to bear in mind, that it matters not how finely furnished or expensive-looking the restaurant or dining saloon may be \u2014 such are as economical as the meanest places of the same sort. Emigrants, arriving in New York, make a great mistake in that respect, by going to second and third-rate dining rooms \u2014 at the request of interested parties \u2014 near the wharves, which are the most expensive and most unsatisfactory of any. They should go to a first-class restaurant, or to a hotel on the European plan, and by going into the coffee room, they can have what they want, of the very best description, and at the most moderate charges. The fittings of some of these dining saloons exceeds any thing of the kind we ever saw in Great Britain, and what with plate-glass all round the walls, rich and expensive drapery, carving and gilding, with marble tables, all in a style of palatial magnificence nowhere excelled, and yet, as we have said, the charges at such, are as low as at many verv in ferior places of the same kind."], [49, "45 STORES \u2014 STREET RAILROADS. WHOLESALE AND RETAIL STORES, The retail stores, in extent and character, range from the roughest and most primitive \" shanty\" to the most gorgeous marble palace situated in Broadway. The wholesale stores, in general, occupy only floors (called \" flats,\" in Scotland). In one block of building, from 30 to 40 feet wide and 200 feet long, there will be found 3 or 4 wholesale storekeepers. There are scarcely any colossal establishments, snch as Morrison, Dillon & Co.'s, Cook, Sons & Co.'s, Leaf, Coles & Co.'s, of London ; S. & J. Watts', H. Ban nerman & Sons', I. & N. Phillips & Co.'s, or Potters & Norris, in Manchester ; or J. & W. Campbells, Stewart & McDonald's, or Arthur & Fraser's, in Glasgow. There may be said to be really no monster dry goods stores in New York, which can take rank with any of the foregoing houses, excepting A. T. Stewart & Co.'s, on Broadway \u2014 certainly the largest concern of the kind in America. It is both wholesale and retail. There are smaller establishments, more splendid in architectural design, and with more elaborately carved marble fronts, but not one of them can compare, as regards extent, or amount of business turned over, with Messrs. Stewart's house. As regards the interior magnificence of its retail departments, it can vie with an}- in London or Paris. THE STREET CARS, OR RAILROADS. As may be well known, some of the principal streets in New York, are laid with a double Une of rails, over which are run railroad ears, each drawn by two horses. The car is a low set railway carriage, with an entrance and a platform at each end. At one end stands the driver, with a brake at his side, which he uses with one hand, and pulls the reins -with the other, when he wishes to allow a passenger to get off or on. If you are in the car, you have merely to pull the strap, on the roof of the car, and it rings a bell, on hearing which the driver pulls up. There is a conductor who takes the fares, and it is astonishing with what eagle-eyed sharpness he detects a fresh passenger, who may have jumped on whilst the car was in motion, and mixed amongst a crowd, most probably. These cars are seated for about 24, but on the platform, there is standing room for 10 or 12 at each end, so that in the morning and evenings they will be seen bowling along with a load of, sometimes, as many as from 40 to 50 people, the centre of the car inside being lined with passengers standing. They are very wide and roomy, well cushioned, and easy to ride in. They run the full distance from point to point, which is about 5 miles, for 5 cents, (or 2|<-. J=tg.,) going at the rate of fully 6 miles per hour. Notwithstanding that the ordinary street omnibuses run on the same lines, and that they, as well as carts and vehicles of all sorts, cross and re-eorss the rails, there is never any accident with them. Attached to the horses ave small bells, which warn all of their approach, and with the powerful drag in the hands of the driver, a collision can be promptly prevented. There are several companies interested in these cars. Each one has a separate route, and keeps to its own, running back and forwards, day after day, every day in the week. The men who are conductors and drivers are employed 15 to 16 hours per day, and are required to keep their time to a minute, in arriving and departing from each terminus, which they do every 2 minutes. The horses are employed only about 3 hours per day, running in that time 18 to 20 miles per day. On the ringing of the bell, they are so train ed, that they understand to pull tip and start, as the case maybe. One line of these cars belongs chiefly to one of the most celebrated men in New York, an American by birth, named George Law, the son of a Scotchman, who is said to be one of the most successful speculators in the United States, and a man who has always work ed like many of his countrymen, more with his head, than his hands. To see the stables belonging to him, where the horses belonging to his line are housed, is one of the sights of New York. There nearly 800 horses are to be seen, all well cared for and made comfortable. The feed for them is laid in, on the best terms, and machinery assists in cutting and bruising it to render it as profitable as possible."], [50, "46 NEW YORK: STREET RAILROADS. We fancy that Wilson, of the \" Favourite\" line of busses in London ; Greenwood __ Tur ner's, of Manchester, with their 3 horse abreast Scotch buss; or Andrew Menzie\u00a7, of Glas gow, can scarcely boast of doing this particular branch of city trade, on so extensive a scale, as that now described, far less conveying passengers 5 miles for 1\\d. We understand that each car makes 16 journeys per day, and carries on an average, about 30 passengers each trip. There are about 70 cars on one line, giving something like the following result : \u2014 Total number of cars, 70. Running equal to 5,320 miles, and carrying 33,600 passengers per day. Income at 5 cents each, $1,680, or \u00a3336, stg., in one day, or $11,760 per week, or in one year $611,520, (\u00a3122,640,) on one line of streets alone ! The line of George Law's, it is said, pays at least 12 per cent dividend, besides bonuses. A new description of one horse' railroad car was started in New York last August, and a most comfortable car it is. Connected with it, there is _)o conductor. Tlie driver pulls up \u2014 you enter \u2014 put the amount of your fare down a slip near the roof, and it drops into a glass ease. When the driver, who sees through the glass that the amount is correct, he touches a spring, and the coin falls down into a locked drawer underneath ; the money never being touched by the driver, and beyond his reach. If you have no change, the driver will give you full change, through a hole in the top of the omnibus. On entering the car you deposit the proper amount of fare as stated.

The city is nearly surrounded by a fine amphitheatre of hills of moderate elevation, covered with trees and shrubbery, and eonimandijig from many points picturesque scenery, and extensive views of the \" River of Swans,\" which, descending from the Alleghany Mountains, and winding its way for nearly 400 miles through a fertile and most attractive country, expands into Chesapeake Bay. The environs of the city abound in elegant villas and country seats. \"Lat. 38\u00b0 55' 48\" north, and long. 77\" 1' 30\" west from Greenwich. It is the first meri dian of American geographers. \" The 6ite has a gently undulating surface. The city extends N. W. and S. E. about 4\u00a3 miles, and E. to S. about 2\u00a3 miles. The public buildings occupy the most elevated situations. The streets run N. and S., and E. and W., crossing each other at right angles, with the exception of 15, which point to the States, of which they severally bear the names. The Capitol commands the streets called Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania avenues ; the President's House, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New York, and Connecticut avenues, and all these different intersections form 1170 squares. Pennsylvania avenue, which stretches in a direct line from Georgetown to the Eastern Branch, passing the Presi dent's House to the Capitol, is 4 miles in length, and 160 feet wide between those edifices, and beyond them 130 feet. The streets are from 70 to 100 feet wide. The whole area of the city is about 3016 acres, and its periphery about 14 miles. \"The city was founded, and the corner-stone of the Capitol was laid, with masonic honours, on fie 18th Sept., 1793, and the city was first occupied as ihe seat of government in 1800. \" The public buildings of Washington are the Capitol, the Executive Mansion, the State Offices, Treasury Buildings, War Offices, Navy Offices, Offices of the Secretary of the Inte rior, Patent Office, Post-office, Office of the Attorney-general, National Observatory, the Arsenal, Navy Yard, Smithsonian Institute, National Medical College, Columbian College, Coast Survey Office, City Hall, National Institute, numerous churches, the hotels, and many others devoted to a variety of useful, literary, and benevolent purposes. \" Public Squares and Parks. \u2014 We condense the following from Miss Lynch's description of Washington : \" The open waste lying between the Capitol, the President's House, and the Potomac, is about to be converted into a national park, upon a plan proposed by the lamented A. J. Downing. The area contains about 150 acres, and the principal entrance is to be through a superb marble gateway, in the form of a triumphal arch, which is to stand at the western side of Pennsylvania avenue. From this gateway a series of carriage drives, forty feet wide, crossing the canal by a suspension bridge, will lead in gracefully curved lines beneath lofty shade-trees, forming a carriage drive between 5 or 6 miles in circuit. The grounds will include the Smithsonian Institute and Washington's monument. The parks round the President's House and the Capitol have already been mentioned. Lafayette Park, on the north side of Pennsylvania avenue, in front of the executive mansion, is laid out and planted with shrubbery, etc., and contains, as we have elsewhere stated, a bronze equestrian statue of President Jackson. To avoid the unpleasant angularity, caused by the peculiar intersection of the streets, open spaces are to be left at these points, which are to be laid out and planted with trees, etc. There are extensive grounds around the City Hall, called Judiciary Square.\" \"Objects of Interest in the Vicinity. \u2014 Fifteen miles south of Washington, on the Poto mac, is Mount Vernon, once the home, and now the tomb of Washington. Thirteen miles above Georgetown are the Great Falls of the Potomac, thought by manj- to equal, in wild ness and picturesque interest, any in the country. The Little Falls, which descend 15 feet perpendicular]}', are only 3 miles above Georgetown. The latter was a favourite fishing resort of Daniel Webster.

CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. The city of Philadelphia ranks second in importance as a city, in the United States. But as a mining and manufacturing centre, probably holds the first position. It is situated on a peninsula something like what New York is, but between the Dela ware and Schuylkill Rivers. The former extending its course of 100 miles, to the sea, and all the way affords depth of water sufficient to float the largest ships at its wharves; the Schuylkill, on the other hand, affording excellent water communication with the mining regions of Pennsylvania. The population of the city by the last census, was 423,000, being an increase of 83,055 over that of 1850 \u2014 showing a population of 261,471 greater than that of Boston, and of 206,904 less than that of New York. In the latter estimate, however, it ought to be borne in mind, that the population of New York is much more of a migratory and unsettled \u2014 therefore, unproductive character, than that of probably any city in the States \u2014 but par ticularly so in comparison with the character of the population of Philadelphia, which is of a much more permanent and productive character. The number of Irish alone in New York, engaged in domestic employment \u2014 consequently, unproductive labour \u2014 is 175,375. Since the last census was taken, the population of Philadelphia has increased to nearly 600,000. Approaching Philadelphia from New York, you arrive most probably per roil from Am bo}', at Camden station. From there you cross the River Delaware in the ferry steamer which lands you at Walnut Street Wharf. Approaching the city from the west or north you arrive at the station on the western side of the Schuylkill River, where the locomotive will leave the train. Your carriage will be drawn by six or seven mules for about 1 $ miles into the centre of the city, at which you will find' the carriages of the principal hotels waiting, as well as cabs, and plenty of coloured porters. The stranger, on visiting Philadelphia, cannot but be struck with the vast dimensions of the citj- \u2014 its immense manufacturing productive powers \u2014 its spacious streets, laid out with the mathematical precision of the foot-rule \u2014 its public and private palatial buildings \u2014 its vast wholesale and magnificent retail stores \u2014 its gaily dressed ladies \u2014 all combining to up set our previous conceptions of a \" Quaker city\" \u2014 not presenting in its external character, almost any thing akin to the quiet staidness of the worthy representatives of its founder, Quaker William Penn. Friends in the east would have us to believe that Philadelphia was a city, nowhere \u2014 that as much business was done in New York in one day, as was done in Philadelphia in one year \u2014 that the people of Philadelphia were asleep \u2014 behind the age \u2014 and, as Londoners would say, (when they talk of such cities as Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow) a place \" in the country\" \u2014 conveying the idea of some suburban town. Our visit to Philadelphia, then, was an agreeable surprise in every respect. We visited some of the streets where the stores are located, and found in them, every one busier than another \u2014 nailing up boxes, hauling them out on trucks, and into wagons at the doors. Dry goods salesmen we found neck deep in mazes of prints and calicoes, displaying thom to western customers, and these marking their purchases ; hardware men quoting the lowest for some of Sheffield's best productions; grocers and their customers, buried behind huge piles of boxes of tea, whilst testing their samples ; publishing houses crammed full of books of all sorts and sizes, from \" Jack the Giant Killer\" to Lippen cott's ponderous \" Gazetteer,\" \u2014 with their floors jammed full of cases being packed to send off to enlighten the natives as well as foreigners, in all quarters of this mighty continent. Young men would be seen labelling immense cases of goods for the chief cities in the west and south, and even east, as far as Boston ; carters loading and unloading every con ceivable kind of package, all betokening an amount of business, despatch, and bustle, which made us begin to consider whether we were in New York or Philadelphia. Entering some of the immense factories in iron work, the large letter-press printing es-"], [57, "53 PHILADELPHIA. tablishments, both book and newspaper \u2014 seeing them throwing off their dailies by their tens of thousands, as fast and as cheap as human skill ean accomplish \u2014 the immense bind eries, and many other large and busy hives of industry \u2014 we found the same magnitude of operations going on, all clearly letting us know that we were in one of the largest manu facturing cities in this country \u2014 questioning if it was not likely some day to rival its more populous neighbour \u2014 New York \u2014 in manufacturing enterprise. If the stranger should happen to visit Philadelphia about the time we did, (August) or, in fact, at any time du ring the summer months, he will find the scene we have endeavoured to portray. \\VrlK-ie there are so many spacious streets in the city, filled with elegant stores of all kinds, it is difficult to mention any one in particular : but Chestnut street appears to be the principal main street, aud forms the \" Broadway\" of the city \u2014 in which some retail stores are situated, which, for size and elegance, are not, we believe, excelled by any city in the world. The streets generally are clean and in good order, and in that respect forms a pleasing contrast to those cesspools of filth which characterize the streets of the \" Empire City.\" The houses in many of the streets in the city are neat, compact, brick houses, re sembling very much those to be seen in the neighbourhood of London and Manchester \u2014 but instead of being built in rows all joired together, many in Philadelphia are detached along with a piece of ground, and all particularly clean and tidy in appearance. The suburbs of Philadelphia are studded with neat cottages, villas and stately mansions, beautifully situated, surrounded by pleasure-grounds, and inhabited, for the most part, by the manufacturers, merchants, and commercial classes who are engaged in business in the city. From \" Lippencott's Gazeteer\" we quote the following information. \" There is but one park (Independence Square, in the rear of the State House) or public square in the dense part of the city (besides the five enumerated in the general plan) of much importance. In the immediate vicinity of Fairmount water-works (themselves form ing a fine promenade, with an extensive view from the basin) is Lemon Hill, formerly Pratt's Garden, and once the residence of Robert Morris, of Revolutionary fame. These grounds are very extensive, covered with fine old trees, possess great variety of surface, and descend on the west and south-west by steep banks to the Schuylkill River. The squares within the city cover each an extent of from 5 to 7 acres, are enclosed by tasteful iron rail ings, are beautifully laid out, and planted with a great variety of trees. Squirrels, pea fowls, and deer are domesticated in them. Five of these squares are named Washington, Rittenhouse, Penn, Logan, and Franklin. The latter has a fine fountain and basin, with 40 jets of water.\" In public buildings, the city ean boast of some unsurpassed in elegance and in historical interest. Independence Hall, Chestnut street, should be visited by every stranger. In that vener able edifice was held the Convention which framed the Declaration of Independence, and also the Constitution of the United States \u2014 the veritable desk and chair of Washington and Franklin standing as they did on those memorable days; the old bell, with its procla mation of liberty upon it \u2014 \" Proclaim liberty throughout this land, to all the inhabitants thereof,\" and the steps from which the Declaration was signed, on the 4th of July, 1776, from which Washington delivered his \" Farewell Address,\" on his retirement from public life. From the top of the steeple, a most magnificent view of the city is obtained, giving a stranger the most adequate conception of the magnitude and importance of the city. Girard College. \u2014 Philadelphia possesses in Girard College, situated about 2 miles north- west from the State House, the finest specimen of Grecian arehiLecture in the United States, if not of modern times. It is in the Corinthian style of architecture. The entire cost of buildings, wall, and embellishments of the grounds was $1,933,821.78, or $66,000 less than was donated by Stephen Girard for the erection and endowment of the institution. Mr. Girard, who made .this magnificent bequest, was a native of France, who came poor and friendless to Philadelphia in boyhood, and by industry and good management accumulated 'a fortune of several millions, the greater portion of which he left to the city for the erection and endowment of Girard College for Orphans, and for improving the city in various ways."], [58, "54 PHILADELPHIA. '\u25a0\u00bb The Custom House, on Chestnut street, is a magnificent marble building, in imitation of the Parthenon of Athens, and a splendid sample of the Doric style of architecture. The Merchants' Exchange, fronting Walnut, Dock, and Third streets, is also a marble building, of fine proportions, with a semi-circular portico of Corinthian columns. The United States Mint, in Chestnut street, is a handsome edifice of brick faced with marble, in imitation of a Grecian temple of the Ionic order. Our space prevents us from noticing more of the many other magnificent buildings in the city. Philadelphia appears to be well supplied with \"churches \u2014 there being upwards of 230 in the city \u2014 embracing all denominations. The city long preserved great simplicity in her church architecture ; but of late a gradual change has taken place in the style of the relig ious as well as of the private edifices of the city. Recently, a number of costly and highly ornamented churches have been, and are now being, erected. Cemeteries. \u2014 The environs of Philadelphia abound in places of sepulture, among which, for beauty of position, are tbe two principal cemeteries of North and South Laurel Hill, situated on the Schuylkill river, 4 miles north-west from the State House. Water Works. \u2014 Fairmount Water Works, situated in the district of Spring Garden, ou the Schuylkill River, about 2 miles north-west of the State House, were, previous to the erection of the Croton Works in New York, the envy of the other cities of the Union \u2014 Phil adelphia having been for a long time the only city in the United States supplied with water in this way \u2014 and are still justly the pride and boast of Philadelphia, not more for their utility thr.n for the picturesque attractions of the place. It would, perhaps, be difficult to point out anywhere a spot concentrating in the same space so many elements of the beauti ful and picturesque. Libraries, Colleges, Schools, and Literary Institutes. \u2014 Philadelphia had long the hon our of possessing the largest library in the United States. But now the Philadelphia Library, to which we allude, is surpassed in this respect by the library of Harvard College, and the Astor Library in New York. It occupies a plain brick edifice in Fifth street below Chestnut, and was founded, through the influence of Dr. Franklin, (whose 6tatue adorns a niche in front,) in 1731. The Philadelphia and Loganian Libraries are in the same building, and owned by, and loaned to, the same stockholders. They have, united, about 70,000 volumes. The income of the library is $6,300. Strangers are allowed the use of books while iu the building, but they are not to be taken out except by stockholders, or on deposit of their value. Among a host of other libraries, may be mentioned the Athen\u00e6um Library and Reading Room, occupying a beautiful building of light sandstone, in the Italian style, on Sixth street, opposite Washington square. It has about 12,000 volumes on its shelves, and is extensively supplied with maps, charts, and periodicals. The Mercantile Library, situated in Fifth street, opposite Independence square, was es tablished in 1821, for the benefit of merchants' clerks and other young men. The Apprentices' Library has over 14,000 volumes; loaned in 1852 to 937 boys and 670 girls. The Friends have an extensive library in Arch street above Third, and one in Race below Fifth. The Academy of Natural Sciences, located on Bond street, near Chestnut, has the largest museum of natural history in America. Professor Agassiz pronounced this institution the best out of Europe in its collections of subjects of natural history. The Franklin Institute, for the promotion of manufactures and the useful arts, occupies a large building with a marbk front, in Seventh street, above Chestnut. It holds an annual exhibition of American manufactures. The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, located in Chestnut street, is the oldest institu tion of the kind in the United States, and was established in 1807. The Art Union, an association for the promotion of art, has rooms open to the public, where are exhibited annually about 1,000 paintings."], [59, "55 PHILADELPHIA. ln medical science, Philadelphia stands first of the cities of America, and her medical schools are attended by students from not only every portion of the Union, but even from Canada, Mexico, and South America. There is a hom\u0153opathic hospital, at which the stu dents attend clinical lectures. The Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, founded in 1849, has had a very prosperous commencement \u2014 52 studentB attended the class of 1851-2. Public Schools. \u2014 The number of buildings occupied for schools \u2014 many of which are fine structures, and built with especial reference to complete adaptation for places of instruction \u2014 is 180, of which 73 belong to the comptrollers, and 107 are rented. Philadelphia abounds also in private schools of a high character. History. \u2014 Philadelphia was planned and settled by William Penn and a colony of English Friends, or Quakers, in 1682, after a regular purchase from the Indians, ratified by treaty in due form under an elm-tree iu the present district of Kensington. The name of Phila delphia (brotherly love) was given by Penn, both in reference to the ancient city of that name in Asia Minor, and from its embodying principles he had so much at heart. Philadelphia supports from 12 to 15 daily newspapers \u2014 one of which, we believe, has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States.

Every year, but particularly of late, have the capitalists of the city been widening the facilities afforded by its natural position, so as to secure a much greater amount of traffic with the lake cities than ever it has enjoyed, and there appears great probability, from the new routes opened and connections formed with the west, that they will succeed in accom pli-hing their object The banking capital of Philadelphia is $12,000,000 \u2014 a comparatively small amount when compared with the city of New York, with its capital of $56,000,000. So long as Phila delphia is thus hampered with such small means for carrying on \u2014 far less enlarging \u2014 a trade, for which she forms naturally so favourable a nucleus, together with her rate of in terest being one per cent, lower than New York \u2014 by which means large amounts of money find their way thither instead of to Philadelphia \u2014 it seems reasonable to suppose, that the Quaker City never will attain that commercial position for wealth, commerce, and every thing that conduces to the greatness or prosperity of a large city, till she adopts a different line of commercial policy, and enlarges the sphere of her banking institutions. Judging from the character of her manufacturers and merchants, we shall be surprised if such an alteration is not effected before long. To Philadelphia belongs the credit of making the first move for the abolition of the absurd and hvpocritical working usury laws. In the State of Pennsylvania, parties can borrow and lend money upon any terms or rate of interest agreed upon between borrower and lender, and certainly the only rational plan."], [60, "56 BOSTON, CITY OF BOSTON. The city of Boston is the third in commercial importance among6t the leading cities of the United States. It consists, properly speaking, of three divisions \u2014 viz. : Boston Proper, East Boston, and South Boston. \" The streets of Boston were originally laid out upon no systematic plan, and being ac commodated to the unevenness of the surface, many of them are crooked and narrow ; but these defects have of late been remedied to a considerable extent, so that now the princi pal thoroughfares are convenient and spacious. Washington and Tremont streets are the fashionable promenades. Although Boston Proper is circumscribed in its limits, it contains one of the finest public parks \u2014 the Common \u2014 that is to be found in any city of America. Known to the earliest settlers by the name of \" Tower Fields,\" and occupied afterwards as a town cow-pasture, Boston Common has since been set apart, ornamented, and carefully preserved for the common benefit of the citizens in all coming time. Nearly 50 acres are included within its boundaries, embracing almost every variety of surface, from the level plat to the gentle slope and abrupt ascent. Towering elms, some of which are a hundred years old, enclose the borders, while within, graded walks, beautifully shaded, intersect each other in every direction. Near the centre is a small pond, where a fountain of Cochit uate sends up its crystal stream, whirling and sparkling, 60 or 70 feet into the air. The en tire grounds are surrounded by a costly iron fence, 1977 yards in length. The northern portion of the Common, occupying the southern declivity of Beacon Hill, affords a fine view of Charles River, and the country in that direction. Tlie space towards the west, between the Common and Charles River, is occupied by a botanic garden, covering about 25 acres. Other public grounds have been laid out in the newer portions of the city, some of which are beautifully ornamented, and have fountains in the centre. \"Boston harbour opens to the sea between two points nearly 4 miles distant from each other \u2014 Point Mderton on Nantasket, and Point Shirley in Chelsea. It is sheltered from the ocean by the peninsulas of which these two points are the extremities, and a large number of islands, between which are three entrances. The main passage, which is about 3 miles S. E. from the navy yard, and so narrow as scarcely to admit two vessels to pass abreast, lies between Castle and Governor's islands, and is defended by Fort Independence and Fort Warren. A passage north of Governor's Island is also protected by Fort War ren. A new fortress, of great size and strength, now nearly completed, on George's Island, guards the entrance to the outward or lower harbour. The entire surface included within Point Alderton and Point Shirley is estimated at 75 square miles, about half of which affords good anchorage ground for vessels of the largest class. It is easy of access, free from sand-bars, and seldom obstructed with ice. The whole is thickly studded with islands, and is the reservoir of several small streams, among which are the Mystic, Charles, Neponset, and the Manatiquot Rivers. 'Among the public buildings, the State House, from its position, is the most conspicuous. It stands on the summit of Beacon Hill, fronting the Common. The view which is afforded from the cupola is unsurpassed by any thing in the United States, if not in the world, tin the north towers Bunker Hill monument, marking the place where the first great battle of the Revolution was fought. On the entrance-floor stands a fine statue of Washington, by Chantrey. The representatives' hall is in the centre on the principal floor, the senate chamber in the east, and the governor's and council chamber in the west wing. The old State House is still standing at the upper end of State street, on the site occupied as the seat of government in Massachusetts 140 years. Faneuil Hall, the \" Cradle of Liberty,\" as it is called, is an object of much interest, as being the place where the orators in the days of Hancock and Adams roused the people to resistance against British oppression. Faneuil Hall Market, immediately east of Faneuil Hall, on Dock street, was at the time of its erection the handsomest market house in the United States. It is upwards of 500"], [61, "CITY OF BOSTON. 57 feet long, 50 feet wide, and two stories high, with a dome. The Becond story, called Quincy Hall, is so constructed that it can be occupied as several apartments, or thrown into one, as occasion may require. The building was erected in 1826, at a cost of about $150,000. There are several other markets in the city, besides those at East Boston and South Boston. The CuBtom House is near the head of Long Wharf, fronting both on Com merce street and on the harbour. It is built of granite, in tlie form of a cross, and sur mounted by a dome, the top of which is 90 feet from the ground. The foundation rests upon 3000 piles. Its length is 140 feet. ; width, including the projections of the cross, 95 feet Each front has a portico of six Doric columns \u2014 each a single stone, costing about $5,000. The entire cost of the building was upwards of $1,000,000. The Merchants' Ex change is a magnificent fire-proof building, situated on the south side of State street It has 76 feet front, and extends back 250 feet to Lindall street, covering 13,000 feet of ground. The front is composed of Quincy granite, with four pilasters, each a single stone 45 feet high, and weighing about 55 tons. The roof is of wrought-iron, covered with galvanized sheet-iron. The great central hall, 80 feet by 58, is occupied as the Merchants' Exchange and reading-room. In the basement is the city post-office. The building was finished in 1842, and cost, exclusive of the ground, $175,000, The City Hall, a granite building, con sisting of an octagon centre with wings, is located on a plat of ground between Court square and School street. The Court House, also of granite, is in Court square between the City Hall and Court street. It contains the rooms of the city, county, and United States courts. The City Prison, consisting of a centre building in the form of an octagon, with four wings extending in opposite directions, is near the foot of Cambridge street. Masonic Temple, in which the Freemasons have a lodge, is on Tremont street, fronting tho Common. The new Tremont Temple, erected on the site of the one burnt in 1852, is on Tremont street, opposite the Tremont House. The Boston Music Hall, completed in 1852, fronts both on Winter street and on Bumstead Place. The length of the central hall is 130 feet; width, 80 feet; height, 65 feet \" In Boston there are nearly a hundred churches of the various denominations. \"The wharves and warehouses of Boston are on a scale of magnitude and grandeur sur passed by no other city of equal population. The north and east sides of Old Boston are lined with wharves and docks, which, taken together, make up an aggregate length of over 5 miles. \"Institutions. \u2014 Boston contains a great number of literary, scientific, and educational in stitutions, among which may be mentioned the Boston Athen\u00e6um, incorporated in 1807, situated on Beacon street. The Massachusetts Historical Society, organized in 1790, pos sesses a library of 7000 bound volumes, and about 450 volumes of manuscripts, together with an extensive collection of pamphlets, maps, charts, coins, and other relics. The Bos ton Library Society, founded in 1792, have a hall in the Tontine buildings, and a library of over 12,000 volumes. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences has a library of 8000 volumes. Excepting the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, this is the oldest organization of the kind in the United States, having been founded in 1780. The Mercantile Library Association, instituted in 1820, has a collection of upwards of 13,600 volumes. The first Mechanics' Apprentices' Library Association ever organized was estab lished in Boston in 1820. The origin of this class of institutions is traced to Dr. Franklin. Efforts are now being made to establish a Free City Library, towards which the contribu tions have been very liberal. The Lowell Institute was established by John Lowell, jun., who bequeathed to it a legacy of $250,000. The bequest provides for regular courses of free lectures, to be given upon natural and revealed religion, physics and chemistry in their application to the arts, and numerous other important subjects. There are also many other similar societies, such as the New England Historical and Genealogical Society, the Boston Society of Natural History, the American Oriental Society, the American Statistical As sociation, the Boston Lyceum, the Handel and Haydn Society, the Musical Educational Society, and the Boston Academy of Music. \" Closely identified with the history of Boston is her 8ystem of public instruction. Ever"], [62, "58 CITY OF BOSTON. cherished with maternal care, her schools have long been ornaments to the city, and the pride of New England. As early as 1635, the town records bear evidence to the estab lishment of a \" free school,\" and from that hour to the present, no interest has received more earnest attention than the subject of education. The system comprises four grades \u2014 primary, grammar, high, and Latin schools. There are about 190 primary, and 21 gram mar schools. The high and Latin schools are exclusively for boys. The school committee consists of the mayor of the cit}-, the president of the common council, and 24 other per sons chosen for the purpose. \"The benevolent institutions of Boston are numerous and well endowed. The Massachu setts General Hospital occupies a plot of four acres of ground in the western part of the city, on the right bank of Charles River. The building is constructed of Chelmsford gran ite, 274 feet long, and 54 wide. Thirty thousand dollars have been contributed since 1843 for the support of this institution, by a single individual, the Hon. William Appleton of Boston. The McLean Asylum received its name from John McLean, Esq., of Boston, a lib eral benefactor of the General Hospital. The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asy lum for the Blind occupies the fine building formerly known as the Mount Washington house, in South Boston. In addition to other contributions, it receives $9000 annually from the State. The average number of pupils is about 100. There are also located in South Boston, the Boston Lunatic Hospital and the Houses of Industry and Reformation. In the western portion of the city is the Boston Eye and Ear Infirmary, and in the southern part the New England Female Medical College. \" There are issued in Boston about 100 periodical publications, treating of almost every subject, whether of news, art, literature, or science. Of these, more than twelve are dai lies. Among the others, are comprised several of the most distinguished literary and sci entific journals in the United States. \"Commerce, Finance, etc. \u2014 In commercial importauce, Boston is among the first cities of America. Her foreign commerce has always been great, and extends to almost every na tion on the globe. Her coast trade is always immense. Along the wharves, in every di rection, and at all times, may be seen forests of masts, and vessels from all parts of the world. \"There were, in December, 1852, 30 banks in Boston, with an aggregate capital of $24,660,000. Several other banks have since gone into operation. There were, also, 18 insurance companies. \"The want of river advantages is supplied to Boston by railroads, of which seven great lines terminate in this city. There are lines of railway, recently completed, opening com munication with the St. Lawrence River at Ogdensburg in New York, and La Prairie in Canada, and another through Maine, to Montreal. \"The peninsula on which Boston is situated furnishes large quantities of excellent water. \"The first blood shed in defence of American liberty was shed in Boston, and throughout the entire war no people contributed more largely towards its support. Boston continued a town until its population had increased to nearly 45,000. In 1855, the population was 162,629.\""], [63, "BALTIMORE. 59 CITY OF BALTIMORE. Baltimore, the \"Monumental City\" of the United States, ranks amongst the most im portant commercial cities in the Union. \" The city is admirably situated both for foreign and internal commerce. The bay around which it is built, affords a secure and spacious harbour, and it has communication by rail way not only with Philadelphia and Washington, but with Winchester, Annapolis, Cum berland, Frederick City, York, Lancaster, and Harrisburg. The limits of the city comprise about 10,000 acres of land, extending about four miles and a half from east to west, and three and a half from north to south. It consisted originally of more than fifty elevations or hills, separated by abrupt valleys, or ravines, and, in a few instances, by formidable marshes, while, nearly in the centre, it is divided by a rapid stream of water known as \" Jones's Falls.\" This stream has several times overflowed its banks, causing loss of life, as well as occasioning a great damage to property. The city authorities have in consequence been at great pains to remove all obstructions from its bed, and have taken care that the numerous bridges by which the stream is crossed, should be constructed with a single arch, and of such a height as to remove all further danger from this source. The city east of Jones's Falls is divided into two parts\u2014 Fell's Point and the Old Town. The Point is the most easterly portion of Baltimore, and has the advantage of greater depth of water at the wharves than the upper harbour contains. It is the resort of seamen and immigrants, and the. place where the greater part of the shipbuilding and manufactures of the city are car ried on. Old Town lies north and west of this, and is principally inhabited by mechanics and labourers. The portion west of \" the Falls\" is likewise divided into two parts, the City Proper and Spring Garden section. The former is the centre of trade, and contains most of the residences of the more wealthy citizens. Spring Garden section is the extreme south-western quarter, and is inhabited chiefly by mechanics and labourers. From the number and prominence of its monuments, Baltimore has been denominated the Monu mental city. The most remarkable of these is the Washington Monument, which stands on an eminence at the intersection of Charles and Monument streets, about 150 feet above high water mark. Its base, 20 feet high and 50 feet square, supports a Doric column 167 feet iu height, surmounted by a statue of Washington 13 feet high. The shaft, 20 feet square at the base and 14 at the top, is ascended by means of a winding stairway within. The whole is composed of white marble, and cost $200,000. Its summit commands a beautiful and varied prospect. \" Battle Monument, at the corner of Calvert and Fayette streets was erected in 1815, to the memory of those who fell while defending the city from the attack of the British, Sep tember 12, 1814. \"The Armistead Monument, a beautiful specimen of sculpture, near the city fountain, was erected to the memory of Colonel George Armistead, the commander of Fort McHenry, when bombarded by a British fleet, in September, 1814. \" Among the public edifices of Baltimore, may be named the City Hall, on Holiday street, occupied by the city council and public offices. The Court House, a commodious edifice at the corner of Washington and Lexington streets, contains the rooms of the city and county courts. The State Penitentiary, at the corner of Madison aud Forrest streets, consists of three separate buildings besides the workshops. A short distance from the Penitentiary stands the County Prison, a handsome building, surmounted by a cupola, and ornamented with a tower at each end in the form of an octagon. The Exchange, in Gay strett, near Water, is a spacious structure, 225 feet in front, 141 in depth, and three stories high above the basement. The south wing, fronting on Lombard street, and entered from Water street, is occupied as a Custom House. Among the first objects hat strike the attention of one approaching the city, are the shot towers, one of which \u2014 the Merchants' Shot Tower, is the highest in the world, having an elevation of 250 feet. The most imposing church edifice in Baltimore is the Roman Catholic cathedral, on Mulberry street, between Charles and"], [64, "CITY OF BALTIMORE '' TUB M0NCM2NTA1 C1TT.\""], [65, "61 cJ BALTIMORE. Cathedral streets. It is a massive granite structure, 190 feet long, 177 broad, and 127 from the ground to the top of the cross surmounting the dome. The Unitarian Church, at the corner of Franklin and Charles streets, is much admired for its architecture. It is 108 feet long and 78 wide, with a dome 55 feet in diameter, supported by 4 arches, each 33 feet span. It is 80 feet from the ground to the summit of the cupola. St. Paul's, an Episcopal church on the corner of Sarotoga and Charles streets, the First Presbyterian Church, corner of North and Fayette streets, the First Baptist Church, at the corner of Lombard and Sharp streets, and the German Reformed Church, in Second, between Gay ami Belvidere streets, are all distinguished either for elegance or their style of architecture. At the last census, Baltimore contained 99 churches of the various denominations. \"Institutions. \u2014 The educational, literary, and benevolent institutions of Baltimore are nu merous. The Medical School of the University of Maryland was founded in 1807. Wash ington Medical College waB founded in 1827, and has 25 students and six professors. The University of Maryland, founded in 1812, is situated on Lombard street, between Green and Paca streets: connected with it, is the Baltimore Eye and Ear Infirmary, where stu dents have an opportunity of attending lectures and witnessing operations. The Maryland Institute occupies a suite of rooms in the Athen\u00e6um, at the corner of Lexington and St Paul streets. Its object is, the diffusion of useful knowledge and the promotion of the me chanic arts. It possesses an extensive chemical laboratory, and a very complete philosoph ical apparatus. The building is a noble brick edifice, 112 feet by 50, and 66 in height It was completed in 1848, at a cost of over $28,000. The various apartments, besides those appropriated to the use of the Institute, are occupied by the Mercantile Association, who have a well-selected library of 8000 volumes, and an ample supply of the choicest magazines and papers of the day ; the Baltimore Library Ccmpanj-, possessing a valuable library of 14,000 volumes; and the American Historical Society, whose library numbers about 15,000 volumes, consisting, for the most part, of statistical and historical works. The City Library, designed for the use of the stockholders, the Apprentices' Library, and the Exchange Reading-room, are all important institutions. The Exchange Reading-room is supported by subscription. Strangers and masters of vessels, however, have access to the periodicals and newspapers, free of expense. The Baltimore Hospital, in the north-western suburb of the city, consists of a centre building, four stories high, flanked with wings that connect with two other buildings, which form the ends of the vast pile. The entire struc ture cost $150,000. It occupies a commanding elevation, overlooking the city, the bay, and a wide extent of country. The interior arrangements are upon the most approved plan. The Almshouse is on the Franklin road, about 2 miles N. W. from the city : the building, consisting of a centre and two wings, has 375 feet front, and is surrounded with spacious grounds. The Baltimore Manual Labour School for Indigent Boys has connected with it a tract of land, on which, between the hours of study, the pupils are occupied in labour, thus eombiuing useful employment with healthful exercise. The Baltimore Associa tion for Improving the Condition of the Poor is under the direction of those whose duty it is to visit and inquire into the circumstances and character of the persons relieved, with a view to discourage indiscriminate and injudicious alms-giving. The other prominent ben evolent institutions are, the City Dispensary, corner of Holiday street and Orange alley, the Eastern Dispensary, corner of Market street and Hartford Run avenue, two Orphan Asylums, and the Indigent Sick Society, composed of ladies, who visit the poor and minis ter to their comforts in sickness. \"Education. \u2014 The system of public instruction in Baltimore has, within a few years past, been much improved, and is now rapidly increasing in public favour. \" Commerce, Finances, etc. \u2014 In commercial importance, Baltimore ranks among the first cities in the United States. Its position is such as to render it a great centre of trade. Sit uated near the head of Chesapeake Bay, it enjoys superior advantages for foreign commerce, while the numerous lines of railway, that here have their termination, invite to it the ag ricultural and mineral wealth of a vast interior. The recent completion of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad to Wheeling, is a most important event, and destined to exert an immense"], [66, "62 BALTIMORE.

In the eloquent language of one of her citizens, \" We have reached the threshold and stepping-stone of our true com mercial greatness, and there is nothing now that can turn us back. The wide and far West has opened her ample arms to receive us, and bids us God-speed in our efforts to secure the prize which nature has so long and so patiently held out to us.\" There were, January 3d, 1853, 12 banks in Baltimore, with an aggregate capital of $7,291,415, and a circulation of $2,074,587 ; 2 other banks have since been chartered ; 1 health and 10 fire and marine in surance companies, besides many insurance agencies. \" Baltimore enjoys superior advantages for manufactures. Jones's Falls and Patapsco River afford immense water-power, which is extensively employed for flouring-mills, of which there are over 60 within 20 miles of the city. Numerous cotton and other manu factories are also in operation. \" This city has an abundant supply of pure water, both from Springs and from Jones's Falls. These springs, or fountains, are in different parts of the city, and enclosed with circular iron railings. Over them are small open temples, consisting of a dome supported by pillars. The water from Jones's Falls is brought by means of an aqueduct, about half a mile long, to a reservoir in Calvert street, and from thence is conducted through distributing pipes to the various parts of the city. The more elevated portions, however, are supplied from a reservoir replenished by forcing-pumps on an eminence in Charles street, near Washington Monument. On Federal Hill is an observatory, which serves, in connection with another at Bodkin Point, to announce the approach of vessels. In this way, a marine telegraph is established, by which information is conveyed in a few minutes from the mouth of the Pa tapsco to an observatory in the Exchange. \" About 25 newspapers are issued in Baltimore, of which 6 or 7 are dailies. Population, about 200,000.\" a t"], [67, "NEW ORLEANS. 63 NEW ORLEANS, (THE CRESCENT CITY.) The city of New Orleans forms the great commercial capital of the southern states, and occupies the position of the greatest cotton market in the world. \" The city is built around a bend in the river, from which circumstance it has been de nominated the ' Crescent City.' The site inclines gently from the margin of the Mississippi towards the marshy ground in the rear, and is from 2 to 6 feet below the level of the river at the usual spring freshets. To prevent inundations, an embankment or levee, about 15 feet wide and 6 feet high has been raised, extending 120 miles above the city, and to Port Plaquemine, 43 miles below it. This form_\u00aba delightful promenade. In consequence of the change in the course of the river opposite New Orleans, large quantities of alluvium, swept from the north and held in suspension by the current, are here deposited. New formations from this cause, in front of that portion of the quay most used for the purposes of com merce, have been so rapid that it has been necessary, within a few years, to build piled wharves jutting out from 50 to 100 feet into the Mississippi. The levee here has also been gradually widened, so that an additional block of warehouses has been erected between the city and the river during the past year. \" Here may be seen what New Orleans was before the application of steam to navigation. Hundreds of long, narrow, black, dirty-looking, crocadile-like rafts lie sluggishly, without moorings, upon the soft batture, and pour out their contents upon the quay \u2014 a heterogeneous compound of the products of the Upper Mississippi and its tributaries. There are rafts, or flat-boats, as they are technically called, each frequently carrying cargoes valued at from $3,000 to $15,000. Twenty years ago, and these were the only craft on the river 1 nor has their number been decreased since the introduction of the steamboat Not less charac teristic of New Orleans is the landing of the latter class of craft. The quay is here all ac tion, and the very water is covered with life. Huge vessels float upon its bosom, which acknowledge none of the powers of air, and wait no tide. One is weighed down to the guards with cotton, a freight of 3,000 bales \u2014 $180,000 ! Twenty more lie side by side laden with the same commodity. Huge piles, bale upon bale, story above story, cover the levee. Pork without end, as if the Ohio had emptied its lap at the door of New Orleans ; and flour by the thousand barrels rolled out upon the quay and heaped up \u2014 a large area is covered with these two products of the up-country, and still appears seemingly undiminished, although the seller, the buyer, and drayman are busy in the midst of it Here is a boat freighted with lead from Galena, and another brings furs and peltry from the head waters of the Missouri, 3,000 miles to the north-west ! The Illinois, the Ohio, the Missouri, the Arkansas, and Red River, all are tributaries to this commercial depot, and send down to its wharves merchantable material of the annual value of $100,000,000, more or less. Nearly 20,000 miles of inland navigation is tributary to this city. The quay appropriated to the foreign and coastwise shipping presents another and a different scene. Here the cotton bale, tobacco hogshead, pork and flour barrel, and the whisky cask, yield to bales of foreign and domestic manufactures, pipes of wine, and crates of wares. The shipping stretches away as far as the eye can reach, two miles or more in extent, three tiers deep, with their heads to the current curving with the river \u2014 a beautiful crescent The English, the French, the Spanish, the Dane, the Russian, the Swede, the Hollander, etc., are here commingled, and compete for the commerce of the teeming West. The old city proper, originally laid out by the French, is in the form of a parallelogram, 1320 yards long and 700 yards wide. Above this are what were formerly the faubourgs of St. Mary, Annunciation, and La Course ; be low, Marigny, Dounois, and Declouet ; and in the rear, Treine and St. John's. Lafayette, till recently under a separate government, is immediately above the city. In 1836, New Orleans was divided into three municipalities by act of the assembly, each with distinct municipal powers. Again in April, 1852, these and Lafayette, with the faubourgs and other dependencies, extending from 6 to 7 miles along the river, and about 5 miles back to Lake Pontchartrain, were consolidated under one charter, the city assuming the debts."], [68, "VIEW OF CANAL STREET, NEW ORLEANS."], [69, "65 THE FRENCH CATHEDRAL, NEW ORLEANS. THE FRENCH CATHEDRAL, NEW ORLEANS. The streets of New Orleans are of convenient breadth, well paved, and usually intersect each other at right angles. Canal street, (of which we give an illustration,) is the broadest street in the city, being over 100 feet in width, with a grass plot in the centre about 25 fee; wide, extending throughout its entire length. Most of the buildings are con structed of brick, and are generally low, except in the business portion, where they are usually 5 or 6 stories high. Many of the dwellings in the suburbs, particu larly in Lafayette, are surrounded with spacious yards, beautifully decorated with the orange, lemon, magnolia, and other ornamental trees. A basement about 6 feet high constitutes the only cellar, as none are sunk below the surface on account of the marshy character of the ground. In different sections of the city are several public squares, among which may be mentioned Jackson Square, formerly Place d' Armes, occupying the centre of the river front of the old town plot, now the First District. It is ornamented with shell walks, shrubber}', statuettes, etc., and js much frequented for recreation. La fayette Square, in the Second District, is finely laid out, and adorned with a profusion of shade trees. Congo Square, in the rear of the city, is also a handsome enclosure. \" Public Buildings. \u2014 The United States Custom House, now in process of erection at New Orleans, when completed, will be the largest building in the United States, with the excep tion of the Capitol at Washington, covering an area of 87,233 superficial feet. The mate rial is from the Quincy quarries of Massachusetts. The United States Branch Mint in New Orleans, is at the corner of Esplanade and New Levee streets, near the river. The Muni cipal Hall, at the corner of St. Charles and Hevia streets, opposite Lafayette Square, is a beautiful marble edifice in the Grecian style of architecture. It is principally occupied with public offices, among which are several of the city government.

The latter contains the City Post-office and Merchants' Reading Room. '* Many of the churches are large and costly structures. The Church of St. Louis, opposite Jackson Square, is a splendid edifice, adorned with a lofty tower on either side of the main entrance. The building was erected in 1850, on the site of the old church, which was pulled down. (See engraving.) It was originally founded in 1792, by Don Audre, on the condition that masses be offered every Saturday evening for the repose of his soul, and the tolling of the bell at sunset on that day still proclaims the observance of the custom. On the right aud left of this edifice are two handsome buildings in the Tuscan and Doric orders, devoted to various purposes of the city government. The Jewish Synagogue, formerly the Canal Street Episcopal Church, is ornamented in front with a handsome colon nade. The Presbyterian Church, opposite Lafayette Square, the new Episcopal church, on Canal street, and St. Patrick's Church, on Camp street, are elegant edifices, each adorned with a graceful spire. The latter is a conspicuous object to one approaching the city from the river. Of the 38 churches in the city, in 1853, 12 are Roman Catholic, 7 Episcopal, 6 Presbyterian, 5 Methodist, 3 Lutheran, 2 Baptist, and 3 Jewish synagogues. \"The hotels of New Orleans are conducted upon a scale of magnitude scarcely equalled in any city of the Union. The city contains 4 or 5 theatres, the principal of which are the St. Charles, the Orleans, or French Theatre, and the American. At the Orleans Theatre the dramatic representations are in French. Among the most remarkable bank edifices may be mentioned the City Bank, on Toulouse street ; Canal Bank, on Magazine street ; and the Bank of Louisiana. Several of the market-houses are deserving of notice. St. Mary's Market, in the Second District, is 480 feet long, and 42 feet wide. The Meat Market, on the Levee, and Washington Market, in the Third District, are also extensive buildings. The cotton presses of New Orleans, about 20 in number, are objects of much interest, each of which usuallv occupies an entire block. The centre building of the New Orleans cot ton press is three stories high, and surmounted by a dome, the summit of which commands a fine view of the city. Not less than 150,000 bales of cotton, on an average, are annually pressed at this establishment. \" Institutions. \u2014 The benevolent institutions of New Orleans are among the most extensive and best conducted in the United States. The literary and educational institutions, many of which have been recently established, are for the most part in a highly prosperous condition. \" The number of school-houses in the city (as appears from the mayor's message) is 40, at tended by 16,886 pupils. The increase in the number of pupils for the last 12 months has been 2094, equal to 23.9 per cent. Number of teachers, 216. Of the 30 school-houses, 17 belong to the city, and 23 are rented. The amount appropriated for school purposes the past year was $188,020. \" About 20 newspapers are published in the city, 9 or 10 of which are dailies. Several are printed iu the French language. \" Commerce. \u2014 New Orleans possessses unrivalled natural advantages for internal trade. The Mississippi River and its tributaries afford not less than 15,000 miles of navigable wa ters, communicating with a vast extent of country, illimitable iu its resources, exhaustless in fertility, and embracing nearly every variety of climate. Every description of craft is employed in transporting the rich products of the upper regions of the \" Father of Waters\" to this great southern emporium. At one portion of its levee may be seen hundreds of flat-boats grounded on the \" batture,\" and filled, some with fat cattle, horses, mules, hogs, and sheep ; others with hay, corn, potatoes, butter, cheese, apples, and cider. The quay here is piled with lumber, pork, flour, and every variety of agricultural produce, as if the Great Valley had emptied its treasures at the door of New Orleans. \" The total value of American produce exported from New Orleans during the year, ac cording to the custom-house records, was $66,344,569, of which amount, $48,076,197 was to foreign countries, and $28,268,327 coastwise. The value of foreign merchandise ex ported during the same period, was $44,780, making a sum total of $76,389,349."], [71, "CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS, 67 AVENUE IN THE CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS, WITH SEPULCHRES ABOVE GROUND. \" Any description of New Orleans would be incomplete without some notice of its ceme teries, many of which are unique in plan and method of interment ' Each is enclosed with a brick wall of arched cavities, (or ovens, as they are here called,) made just large enough to admit a single coffin, and raised tier upon tier, to a height of about twelve feet, with a thickness of ten. The whole inclosure is divided into plats, with gravelled paths, intersecting each other at right angles, and is densely covered with tombs built \u00ab holly above ground, and from one to three stories high. This method of sepulture is adopted from necessity, and burial under ground is never attempted, excepting in the \" Potter's Field,\" where the stranger without friends and the poor without money find an uncertain rest ; the water with which the soil is always saturated, often forcing the coffin and its con tents out of its narrow and shallow cell, to rot with no other covering than the arch of heaven.' Above we give an illustration of one of the avenues in the Cemetery, engraved from a photograph taken there last year, showing the sepulchres above ground. \"Algiers, a flourishing village, or rather suburb of New Orleans, is situated opposite to the city, with which it is connected by a ferry. It has several ship yards and manufactur ing establishments. \" Gas was first employed to light the city in 1834 ; and during the same year, water was introduced from the Mississippi. It is raised from the river by steam to an elevated res ervoir, whence five or six millions of gallons are daily distributed to various parts of the city. \" From its low situation and warm climate, New Orleans is subject to annual visitations"], [72, "68 NEW ORLEANS. of the yellow fever, which have had the effect of greatly retarding the growth and pros perity of the place. Statistical tables show that of those who are born and reared in the city, as large a proportion live to old age as of the inhabitants of other places that are generally deemed healthy. But the yellow fever is particularly fatal to the unacclimated, and especially so to those who have been from infancy accustomed to a northern climate. This circumstance operates as a formidable check on the influx of strangers, to which our great commercial cities owe so large a proportion of their population and activity. Du ring the winter and spring, New Orleans may be regarded as a healthful residence for all, whether natives or strangers; and hopes were entertained that with the improvements in the sanitary regulations, there would be a gradual and steady advance in the health of the city during the warm months; but the past year has disappointed those hopes, the epi demic having appeared in a form as malignant as it is in generaL Its introduction, how ever, it is said can be traced to an infected vessel from South America, where a fever of an unusually fatal character has prevailed. \" Perhaps no city of the Union is so diversified in its population. The sunny isles of the Antilles, Mexico, Central America and South America, France, and Spain, and the other States of Europe, and the sister States northward, have each representatives among the in habitants. The colored races, however, preponderate, and slave or free make up one-half at least Of the white races, the American, French, and Spanish constitute the larger por tion, and in these classes are found what may be denominated the aristocracy. The Irish here, as in other quarters, though forming a large class, are but \" the hewers of wood and drawers of water\" \u2014 the laborers and levee-men, respectable only on election day, and among themselves. The English and Scotch are few in proportion, and are chiefly con nected with the foreign commerce, as merchants or factors, seldom remaining longer in the city than is necessary for the transaction of their particular business; or remaining only during the healthy months of spring and winter. This admixture of races is in some degree embarrassing; so many languages, various customs and manners, and in habits so different, no thorough amalgamation can take place ; and it is even necessary to support newspapers and periodicals of different languages, each of which, in its opinions and ideas, is at variance with the other. \" New Orleans is famous in history as the place designated to become the seat of the mon archy intended to have been established by the treason of Aaron Burr. During the month of January, 1804, the citizens were in a state of continual alarm: volunteer companies and other troops constantly patrolled the streets, ready to suppress the first attempt at insur rection. That year it was made a port of entry, and the next (1805) Kew Orleans was in corporated as a city.

The traveller acquainted with the neighbourhood of the \" Black Country,\" between Birmingham and Walsall and Dudley, in Staffordshire, (England,) will, on his visit to the City of Pittsburg, at once discover the striking resemblance, in many respects, to the dis tricts alluded to. There are the same red brick houses and workshops, the same smoke, the same uneven streets \u2014 from the heavy weights drawn over them \u2014 and at night, the glare of the iron furnaces at work. The picture is, in many respects, complete, even to the poor soil of the hilly country around each \u2014 a peculiarity observable in all surfaces where un derneath is rich in minerals. On the stranger's first visit to Pittsburg, therefore, after visiting either the cities on the seaboard, or, perhaps, the \" Queen City of the West,\" \" the Forest City,\" or the \" City of the Lakes,\" where not a vestige of smoke scarcely is to be seen \u2014 he may be disappointed at the first sight of Pittsburg. Viewed from the hill opposite Pittsburg Proper \u2014 exactly opposite the Monongahela House \u2014 the city is seen to greatest advantage \u2014 with its 5 bridges (and new one building) stretching across the Alleghany and Monongahela \u2014 which together at this point form the Ohio \u2014 whilst it can be seen wending its way down the beautiful valley which bears its name. Either from Alleghany City, or the point mentioned, an excellent view is obtained \u2014 being far higher than the city on the Pittsburg side of tha river. The houses in Pitts burgand Alleghany City are built close up to the very tops of the hill-sides, and presenting something of the appearance which the old town of Edinburgh does when viewed from off either the Calton Hill or Arthur's Seat there. Three of the most important suburbs are, Alleghany City, Birmingham, and Manchester. To quote from a notice of this city, the writer says : \u2014 \" The site of the city is a natural amphitheatre, being environed on all sides by beauti ful hills, rising from 400 to 500 feet above the level of the Ohio, and filled with coal, iron, and limestone, the working of which into articles of utility constitutes the chief occupa tion of the inhabitants. These hills are not, except in a few instances, precipitous, and from their slopes and peaks, afford a series of rich and varied landscapes. \"Pittsburg and its suburbs contain about 90 churches, of which upwards of 50 are in the city proper. Many of these are choice specimens of architectural beauty. \" The manufactures of Pittsburg are immense, and capable of being extended almost in definitely. Indeed there is no known limits to the elements necessary to their augmenta tion. Wood, coal, ores, and agricultural resources, all abound in the utmost profusion and at the greatest possible convenience. \" The annual produce consists of bar, rod, hoop, boiler, and sheet iron, sheet steel, bar steel, nails, spikes, rods, shafts, anchors, and axles. All the works for these are operated by steam power.\" There are also in Pittsburg, large foundries, manufactories of glassware, white lead fac tories, large cotton factories, copper-rolling mill, copper-smelting establishment, vial fur naces, manufactories of locks, coffee mills, scales, etc., and several for the production of various articles of steel manufacture, such as springs, saws, axes, anvils, and vices; and others for making gun-barrels and agricultural utensils. Gas, manufactured from bituminous coal, is furnished at a comparatively trifling cost, for lighting the city. The Alleghany Cemetery, on the Alleghany River, 2 miles above Pittsburg, is one of the most beautiful places of the kind in the world. It comprises 110 acres, tastefully adorned, and enclosed by a wall of stone masonry. As may be well known, Pittsburg was named in honour of the celebrated British prime minister, William Pitt. It was founded in 1765. The suburban districts of Birmingham together with Alleghany City, form the large and rapidly-increasing city of Pittsburg. In 1853, the population of city and suburbs was 110,241, although it must be considerably increased since then."], [77, "73 ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. CITY OF ST. LOUIS. St. Louis occupies the first place amongst the western cities situated on the Mississippi \u2014 the great \" Father of Waters\" \u2014 and from its central position, the inexhaustible supply of mineral wealth within easy distance, the important railroad connections already opened up to the east, and the last greatest transportation triumph achieved only last October \u2014 viz. : opening of the great Pacific mail route from St. Louis to San Francisco, thus joining the Mississippi with the Pacific Ocean by overland journey \u2014 will all contribute to advance the interests and commercial importance of St. Louis to an incalculable extent. \"The site of St. Louis rises from the river by two plateaux of limestone formation, the first 20 and the other 60 feet above the floods of the Mississippi. The ascent to the first plat eau, or bottom, as it may be termed, is somewhat abrupt ; the second rises more gradu ally, and spreads out into an extensive plain, affording fine views of the city and river. St. Louis extends, in all, nearly 7 miles by the curve of the Mississippi, and about 3 miles back ; the thickly-settled portion, however, is only 2 or 2-J miles in length, following the river, and about 1J miles in breadth. The city is well laid out, the streets being, for the most part, 60 feet wide, and, with but few exceptions, intersect each other at right angles. Front street, extending along the levee, is upwards of 100 feet wide, and built up on the side fac ing the river with a range of massive stone warehouses, which make an imposing appear ance as the city is approached by water. Front, Main, and Second streets, parallel to each other and to the river, are the seat of the principal wholesale business. The latter is occu pied with heavy grocery, iron, receiving and shipping houses. Fourth street, the fashion able promenade, contains the finest retail stores. The streets parallel to Front and Main streets are designated Second street, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and so on ; and those on the right and left of Market street, extending at right angles with the river, are mostly named from various foiest trees, similar to the streets of Philadelphia. Large expenditures have been made from time to time in grading and otherwise improving the streets and alleys of St. Louis. \"St. Louis is handsomely built, especially the new portion of the city: the principal ma terial is brick, though limestone is employed to some extent. \" It may be doubted whether any city of the Union has improved more rapidly than this in the style of its public buildings. \" Institutions. \u2014 Among the benevolent institutions may be mentioned the City Hospital, the Marine Hospital, 3 miles below St. Louis, the Sisters' Hospital, the Home for the Friend less, and the Orphan Asylums. The Home for the Friendless, designed for the benefit of aged indigent females, and opened October 4th, 1853, is situated on the Carondelet road, about 4 miles from the court house. The edifice, formerly \" Swiss College,\" consists of a stone centre, 75 feet in length, and two frame wings, each from 30 to 40 feet in length \u2014 the whole two stories high. The premises comprise about 8 acres of ground, variously diversi fied with walks and shade-trees. About $40,000 have been raised for the support of the institution. The City Hospital has long been distinguished for the excellent accommoda tions which it affords to the sick, but of late has been found inadequate to the wants of the rapidly-increasing population. A new edifice, intended as a House of Refuge, has been completed. The building formerly occupied as the \" Smallpox Hospital,\" situated on land in the St. Louis Common, known as the Old County Farm, has been fitted up sir the recep tion of a juvenile reform school. \"The literary and educational institutions of St. Louis, have, considering their recent ori gin, attained a high degree of excellence. \"St Louis has about 25 publication offices, issuing newspapers and other periodicals. Seven or eight newspapers are published daily, tri-weekly, and weekly. Four or five are printed in tne German language. The press is generally characterized by ability, and sev eral of its issues have a wide circulation. \"The water-works, which in 1529 were of very inconsiderable importance, now embrace 35^- miles of pipe."], [78, "74 ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. \" The Levee, which, twenty years ago, was a mere mud bank, with transverse ways to the water's edge, has since undergone very important changes. Great expenditures have been made in filling up and otherwise improving it directly in front of the city. \" SmrriNG, Commerce, etc. \u2014 Each stream which contributes to the commerce of St. Louis has its regular packets, and, for the most part, a separate place of landing. The Missouri, the Illinois, and the Upper Mississippi have as fine craft as float on the Western waters, while the down-river, or New Orleans traders, are scarcely excelled in size, equipment, speed, and construction. The St Louis boats also visit the Ohio, the Wabash, the Tennes see, and other streams. With such an immense inland navigation, the commerce of the port requires a large number of steamers, and its tonnage in this respect exceeds that of every other western city. \" The importations of dry goods for the year were estimated at $7,000,000, (an increase of nearly one million over the previous year,) and the sales at $8,500,000. This, however, only has reference to the wholesale business. Including the retail trade of tbe city, the entire imports were estimated at $10,500,000, and the sales at $13,000,000. The business of the heaviest wholesale houses amounts to from half a million to eight hundred thousand dollars annually. \" The manufactures of St Louis, though in their infancy, are hardly less important than her commerce. The flouring business is carried on here more extensively than in any city of the West. The manufacture of different kinds of chemicals and oils is extensively car ried on. There are in St Louis 10 establishments for the manufacture of tobacco, several of which are on a large scale. The manufacture of hemp into bale-rope and bagging, and the distilling of whisky, also employ a large amount of capital. But however important these several interests may be in themselves, they can hardly be regarded as the most im portant to St. Louis. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the development of the vast min eral resources of the region tributary to her, is destined to exert a controlling influence upon the future of this metropolis. Her manufactures of iron already exceed those of any other city on the Mississippi, if not in the west. Numerous foundries annually turn out stoves and other castings to a large amount Railing, machinery, and steam-engines are extensively manufactured. Mining operations have already been commenced at Iron Moun tain. (See Engraving.) \"The Bank of the State of Missouri is the only chartered banking institution in St Louis or in Missouri. It has five branches, viz. : one at Fayette, one at Jackson, one at Lexing ton, one at Palmyra, and one at Springfield. \" The natural advantages which St. Louis enjoys, as a commercial emporium, are probably not surpassed by those of any inland port in the world. Situated midway between two oceans, and near the geographical centre of the finest agricultural region on the globe, al most at the very focus towards which converge the Mississippi, the Missouri, the Ohio, and the Illinois Rivers, there can be no doubt that she is destined, at no distant period, to become the great receiving and distributing depot of most of the vast region drained by these streams. Having already reached an enviable position among her sister cities, she is look ing westward, with a system of railways intended not only to bring to her markets the agricultural and mineral treasures of the Missouri basin, but eventually to extend beyond the Rocky Mountains to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and finally to the golden shores of the Pacific Ocean. Her connection with the Atlantic cities, through Cincinnati and Chi cago, is already secured beyond contingency. The construction of railroads penetrating various sections of her own state, designed ultimately to communicate with New Orleans, are also about to be undertaken. The opening of these various railways, and others pro posed, will give St. Louis ready access to immense deposites of iron, coal, lead, and copper ores, within a circuit of 90 miles, equal to the wants of the whole Mississippi valley for centuries to come, and which have not to this time been brought into use, simply because of the difficulty and expense of reaching a market. \" The population of St. Louis is upwards of 100,000.\""], [79, ""], [80, "CITY OF CINCINNATI, STATE OF OHIO. FROM FORKEST HILL, KENTUCKY."], [81, "75 CINCINNATI. CINCINNATI, THE QUEEN CITY OF THE WEST. After leaving the seaboard, no city in the United States is likely to surprise the stranger so much as Cincinnati. From an account of Dr. Charles Mackay's visit to it last year, we expected to find iu it another Pittsburg (Pennsylvania) or Manchester (England) for smoke; and on proceeding from the \"Forest City\" (Cleveland) we looked forward to find ing Cincinnati under a cloud, with the anticipation of unpleasant odours from its famed pork-killing establishments. On our entering the city, by the Little Miami Valley railroad, the beauty of that line was only excelled by the charming view presented as the train crept round the curves, opening to view the exquisitely beautiful scenery of the Ohio, both on the Kentucky and Ohio side of the river. Our visit to Cincinnati, therefore, in July lart, was one of unmingled pleasurable disappointment; with a blazing sun overhead, all vegetation in its gayest attire, and not a particle of smoke to be seen, excepting from a solitary steamer, perhaps, getting ready for its voyage to Louisville or the Mississippi. Ascending to the top of Mount Adams, to get a view of the city and surrounding country, we looked in vain for smoke; so that should the gifted author of \"Voices from the Crowd\" pay his friend Nicholas Longworth another visit at Cincinnati, and that any time during the spring or summer months, he will, we think, leave it with a different impres sion, and similar to what he experienced in the cities visited, where the total absence from Bmoke formed one of the peculiarities of American city life. As may be well known, Cincinnati is the most populous city of the Western States, and the fifth in size and importance throughout the union. It is beautifully situated in a valley of about 13 miles in circumference, with the Ohio River intersecting it from the State of Kentucky, environed by a range of hills, thus forming a beautiful basin with one portion of the city in the centre, but the greater part of it rising by terraces, on which Third and Fourth streets form two of the most prominent. For 3 miles, at least, the city extends along side of the river, that portion being lined, for the most part, with stores and shipping places of business, and where from 30 to 40 steamers may be seen engaged in the river traffic, sailing up the river to Pittsburg, 460 miles, and down to ports on the Mississippi, 650 miles distant, carrying, for the most part, goods, but that only when the state of the river permits, and basiness affords sufficient traffic. Both iu the city and in the vicinity some elegant private residences are to be seen, but more particularly in the suburbs of such as Mount Auburn, where there are some beautiful country seats, with vineries in the open air attached to each. One of the finest public buildings of Cincinnati is the Court House, an immense block of buildings built of white marble, but, to a certain extent, obscured from being seen to great advantage, on account of the other buildings being built in too close proximity with it. In churches Cincinnati can boast of having as fine samples as are to be found in the West. Its literary, educational, scientific, and medical colleges and institutions, rank with any thing in the United States; in fact, from the public school up to the most advanced literary and scientific association, Cincinnati is excelled, we believe, by no other city. The Mechanics' Institute, for example, occupies a prominent place amongst the many valu able institutions with which Cincinnati has great cause to be proud of. It is a large, square, massive building, built iu the Elizabethan style, on the corner of Sixth and Vine streets. Its library contains 15,000 volumes, besides having, in an adjoining department, an excel lent selection of newspapers and periodicals. It is under the management of the Central Board of the Trustees and Visitors of Common Schools, two delegates from each ward in the city being part of the management. Rufus King, Esq., a name well known in America, is president. At present it numbers 4323 members. Average delivery of books during the last 7 months, over 6500 volumes per month. Total circulation for 7 months, 35,000 volumes. At the last time when the books were called in for revision, only 8 volumes were wanting"], [82, "76 MECHANICS' INSTITUTE AND MERCANTILE LIBRARY. out of a total circulation of 37,000 volumes, a fact which speaks well for both members and management Even this small number missing was made up by the parties who had become security for those who had got out the books. All young men under age, and not known, are required to get a guarantee from a known citizen, who becomes responsible for any loss the institution may sustain, by giving out books to such party applying for them. The library is made up of the books formerly belonging to the Public School Library and Mechanics' Institution, now joined into one library. From the State, it now \u2014 from its connection with the Public School Library \u2014 receives $8000 annually. The terms of admission to all are \u2014 free. It may appear almost invidious to mention the name of any one donor to this noble in stitution, but we think that Mr. Greenwood's beneficence should be well known, if for no other reason, than that others in different parts, may imitate his example. Besides many subscriptions to the institution, and all along taking an active part in its establishment and welfare, he was, we believe, the principal means of preventing the institution from going down. Amongst its difficulties, it was due Mr. Greenwood no less a sum than $18,000 (\u00a33,600 stg.) for material he had supplied to the building, etc., from his foundry7. Tliat entire sum he made them a present of, from which date, the institution has spread its benefits all around, and engraven the name of Miles Greenwood indelibly in connection with its history, and that of the welfare of the working classes. Again, we may notice another of the reading-rooms and libraries in the city, worthy of all commendation, viz. : the Young Men's Mercantile Library and Reading-room, in Walnut street On one floor of a building 140 feet long, by 100 wide, there will be found a library of 19,000 volumes, in all the departments of literature, occupying fully one-half of the apartment In the other end of it there will be found the best assortment of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals we have seen anywhere. The natives of almost any part of the world will there find the paper of his own neighbourhood. Of course the Thunderer of Printing-House square (London) will be found there on regular file. On the opposite frames \u2014 the Scotsman \u2014 the worthy representative of \"Auld Reekie,\" (Edinburgh, Scot,) and the Dublin Evening Post and Nation., of Ireland, take their stand; the Welshmen are repre sented in the Carnarvon Herald; the Frenchmen, with the Journal des Debats, La Presse, Charivari, L' Illustration, and Galignani ; the Germans, with Zeitungs plenty ; the Austra lian, with the Melbourne Argus ; whilst the United States is represented with sheets of all sorts and sizes, from Maine to California, and not forgetting the well-printed sheet of the Pioneer and Democrat, all the way from St. Paul, Minnesota. Canada papers are also found in abundance. In going over this room, and seeing such a host of London weekly papers, and monthly magazines and quarterly reviews from England, Scotland, and Ireland, a stranger from Great Britain is apt to fancy himself in some of the Exchange reading rooms of Liverpool, Manchester, or Glasgow, or the Waterloo News Rooms in Edinburgh, rathei than on the banks of the Ohio. The quarto and imperial weekly sheets are secured to tables across the room, at which parties may sit and read, some of the most popular London weekly papers showing good evidence of being well perused. The tattered and torn appearance which the Illustrated London News, and that philosophic, philanthropic, and stinging little sinner Punch pre sented, showed that they afford as great a treat to the numerous readers there, as these two publications do in enriching tbe coffers of some American publishers, who depend largely upon them for their excellent illustrations, as, no sooner do they reach this side of the At lantic, than they are reproduced without the slightest acknowledgment as to their source, far less in a pecuniary respect. The magazines are all numbered, and can be taken and read in any part of the building. After perusal they are returned to their proper pigeon-holes in the desk, where they re main open for perusal. The library contains 19,000 volumes. The reading-room, 240 different newspapers, and 120 magazines and reviews are received as soon as possible after publication."], [83, "77 THIRD STREET, CINCINNATI. The term8 of entry are only $3 (12.5. stg.), with $1 entry-money At present it numbers 3000 members. Tho reading-room is most comfortably fitted up. On the floor, for example, there is a magnificent tapestry carpet, aud the newspapers mounted on elegant iron frames of chaste design. Altogether, it appears a model institution of the kind, and we congratulate the Young Men's Mercantile Library Association in haviug such an institute. We had forgot to mention, that the library is adorned with a beautiful marble statue of \" Sabrina,\" and another of \" Eve listening to the Voice,\" as well as busts of some of Amer ica's most accomplished public men. In one respect, this institution differs from any of the kind we have seen in Britain, viz., that of ladies visiting the reading-room, and perusing the books, newspapers, and periodi cals, with apparently great interest, besides forming a large proportion of the visitors to the Young Men's Library, for books. The finest wholesale stores in the city are situated on Pearl street, where they arrest at tention, from their solid stone built appearance, and general excellent design. The other principal streets for the wholesale trade, are, Walnut street, Main street, and Public land ing, from which tens of thousands of dollars' worth of goods change hands weekly."], [84, "78 NEW M. IONIC TEMPLE, CINCINNATI Third street forms also one of the finest streets of the city. At the corner of Third and Walnut street, the Masonic Temple will stand, when completed (see our engraving of the same). In Third street, are situated the greater proportion of the banking houses and offices of the exchange brokers and lawyers in the city. The buildings there also being characterized by that solid magnificence, which well cut and tastefully designed architec ture always portrays. Our view of Third street, as given in the preceding page, repre sents some of the finest buildings in the street, the first one on the left hand, being the premises built and occupied by the celebrated Ohio Life and Trust Company, a banking This splendid structure, an engraving of which we present, is one of the most striking buildings yet erected, we believe, in the United States, and will show more strongly, than per haps any other we could have selected, Ihe amazing rapidity of growth of the western cities of America. On the site where this Masonic temple rears its commanding form, among other costly and palatial stone edifices, in the business centre of the \" queen city\" of the West, men, still in the vigour of life, assure astonished strangers that they can remember when, on the very spot occupied by these palaces, the primitive log-huts of the first settlers were embedded in the forest ! The Nova Cesaria Harmony Lodge, No. 2, under whose auspices this temple is being erected, was instituted in 1794, and is the oldest lodge in Cincinnati. The ground was"], [85, "NEW MASONIC TEMPLE AND FOURTH STREET, CINCINNATI. \u25a09 donated by Wm. McMillan \u2014 now deceased. As a building designed expressly for Masonic uses, it is a question, if, not only in America but in Europe, any temple of the kind has heretofore been erected more complete and convenient in its arrangements, or richer in graceful and symbolic architecture, than the one now under notice. It is being erected entirely of the beautiful freestone, for which Cincinnati is so celebrated, and stands on the north-east corner of Third and Walnut streets, occupying a frontage on Third street of 200 feet, and 100 feet on Walnut street. The style is Byzantine, exhibiting strongly those bold and massive features so characteristic of many of the best buildings of northern Italy. It will be 4 stories high, with a basement, and flanked by three lofty tow ers ; the one at the corner of Third and Walnut streets being 32 feet square at the base, and 185 feet from the ba6e to the vane. In the centre of this tower, on the third story, and fac ing Third street, is a niche designed to receive a life-size statue of W. McMillan, the liberal donor of the property. The upper portion of the tower will have a large town clock, with 4 illuminated dials 7 feet diameter, which will be visible on each face of the tower from a great distance. The first floor, as well as basement, will be used for banking houses and exchange brokers, the second floor for business offices, while the third and fourth floors are devoted exclusively to Masons and Masonic meetings. On the third floor, which is 18 feet 6 inches high, are the chapter room, the library, (lit by a projectiug Oriel window,) royal and select council room, a spacious banquet room, an encampment asylum, a royal arch chapter room, and a Persian court, all for the use of the knights and templars. At the western portion of this floor, and facing Third and Walnut streets, a commodious- suite of rooms form the residence of the janitor, isolated from the remainder of the building, but in convenient juxtaposition. The fourth story, which is 22 feet high, is subdivided into 3 splendid lodge rooms for the entered apprentices, fellow-crafts, and master-masons of N. C. Harmony Lodge, No. 2, and a grand lodge room designed for use only on extraordinary occasions. This fine room is 70 feet long, 42 feet 4 inches wide, and 28 feet in height, lit by the large and beautiful rose window which forms so conspicuous a feature on the Wal nut-street elevation. The attitude of the temple will be 85 feet from the pavement to the cornice, 105 feet to tbe ridge of the roof, and 112 feet to the cornice of the great tower. The roof is a Mansard shape, terminated where visible, by a rich iron railing, and having its surface relieved by seven picturesque dormer windows. The entire cost is estimated at $150,000 (\u00a330,000 stg.). The architects of this building \u2014 -which reflects the highest credit upon their artistic taste and skill \u2014 are Messrs. Hamilton and McLaughlin, whose cards will be found elsewhere. Mr. McLaughlin is still a resident of Cincinnati, but Mr. Hamilton (formerly of London) has recently removed to New York. The engraving, given in another page, has been exe cuted for this work, by two young and very promising wood engravers in Cincinnati, Messrs. Davenport and Thompson, and we have only to refer to this specimen of their work, to show what they can do, for them to be entrusted with drawings of the most intricate character, as the foregoing view was engraved from the architect's drawing, and the manner in which they have preserved every detail correctly, reflects great credit upon their ability as first-class engravers. In our engraving of Fourth street, will be seen a representation of some of the finest blocks in the city, and among the many splendid stores with which it abounds, none _how to more advantage than the magnificent jewellery establishment of Messrs. Duhme & Co., situated in Carlisle Block, corner of Fourth and Walnut streets (the first large block to the left in the engraving on the next page.) This establishment rivals, in that particular depart ment, any thing in New York, or any where else, we believe, in the United States, and . fluids pre-eminent as the Hunt & Roskills (London) of Western America. The visitor there will be struck with the large amount of valuable stock which is to be seen, consisting of the manufactures of some of the best makers in England, France, and Switzerland. In the same block stands, also, one of the finest, if not the finest, bookstore in the city, viz., Messrs. Robert Clarke & Co.'s (late Derby \u00c6 Co). This store is handsomely fitted up, and filled with a large stock of rare and valuable works in all departments of literature"], [86, "80 FOURTH STREET, CINCINNATI. and science. Besides being publishers of several works, Messrs. Clarke & Co. import direct from the publishing houses in England and Scotland. In the same street (Fourth street) a little further west, is now completing a very magni ficent block, intended as the opera house for the queen city. When finished, it will form probably, the finest block in the street, if not in the whole city. Its proportions and de sign are elegant FOURTH STREET, CINCINNATI. Still further west, in Fourth street, stands the new post-office, custom house, and other government offices, all in one building, of a very chaste design and classic character. The inly regr.t is, that so fine a building should have been obscured or buried in appearance, ilongside of the high towering stores built close to the westward of it. Only the front portion of the post-office will be seen in the above engraving, with the national flag waving from the top of it. On the opposite side of Fourth 6treet stand some very elegant stores also, and a visit to Mr. Richardson's outfitting establishment, opposite the post-office, will give an idea of their internal extent, and magnificence. We should say that Fourth street bids fair to be the street of streets in this beautiful and wonderful city, and that a few years will see it lined, from end to end, with buildings of the Bame palatial character."], [87, "NATIONAL THEATRE, CINCINNATI. 81 Amongst the many handsome buildings in the city, few show a finer exterior or more substantial appearance than the National Theatre, on Sycamore street, built by Mr. John Bates. It presents, as will be seen by our engraving of it, a very handsome exterior, ornamented with some very finely-executed sculptor work. Whilst the exterior shows to such great advantage, the interior is tastefully decorated and fitted up. After the old theatre was burned down, we understand a company was formed to build a new one, but ixvnkijjcio 'aaxvaHx tvnoixvn as sometimes \" too many cooks spoil the broth,\" it was likely to prove so in this instance, when Mr. Bates stepped forward, and single-handed, provided the citizens with as comfort able and elegant a theatre as will be found in the United States. The house is built in the most substantial manner, and in that respect, as well as regards ventilation, is every thing that is possible to attain. It is seated for 3000 people, and stands on a lot 100 feet front and 206 feet deep : height of house 90 feet The architect is Mr. Hamilton, who is also"], [88, "82 THE PORK TRADE \u2014 THE EAGLE IRON WORKS. architect of the Masonic Temple, a view of which will be found on another page. The thea tre was built under the personal superintendence of Mr. Bates, who watched its progress from the digging of the foundation to lighting up the gas on the opening night, on 4th July last Under the lesseeship of Mr. Baker, the house, on our visit, was certainly \" drawing\" welL Every thing waB put on the stage promptly and creditably, making the stranger forget, al most, that he was witnessing \"La Traviata\" on the banks of the Ohio. There is scarcely any branch of manufactures but what is carried, on, more or less, extensively in Cincinnati. Its great trade, however, consists in the article of pork. So much so, is this the case, that the city is pretty well known as the porkopolis of Amer ica. In the winter season droves of pigs may be seen, being driven along the streets on their way to the killing and packing-houses, where they are killed, plotted, cut up, pickled, and packed, with a rapidity that is scarcely conceivable. Along the roads, the animals are to be seen reaching the city from neighbouring villages, whilst the railroad vans are loaded with them from all parts of the west To Cincinnati the pork and provision dealers in Belfast (Ireland) find their way once a year, to make purchases and contracts for their supplies, and to there, as well as ports in England, immense shipments are made during the course of the year. Besides what is killed in the city, Cincinnati finds a market for a large amount of pork and bacon \u2014 in bulk. Thus we find, in one year, the quantity to be over 450,000 hogs, 17,000,000 bbls of pork in bulk, and 11,000 hogsheads of bacon, as received into the city. The total amount of which was estimated at $5,500,000, or \u00a31,100,000 sterling. In connection with the manufactures of the city, lard and oil forms important articles. In the articles shipped from the city, a large proportion is in pork, bacon, oil, lard, whiskey, wine, furniture, and machinery. Amongst the large manufacturing establishments connected with the city, the Eagle Foundry of Miles Greenwood, must take the first place. It is one of the largest of its kind in the United States, and an establishment, where, probably, a greater variety of articles are manufactured under one roof, than can be named in any other city. There will be found articles varying in size and weight, from 300 pieces in a lb., to 10 tons for one piece, verifying, almost, the popular saying, of every thing from \" a needle, to an anchor.\" In the manufacture of one article alone \u2014 that of Btoves \u2014 no less than 2500 tons of iron are used annually. Butt hinges are made in enormous quantities, and with a stock on hand, apparently, sufficient to hinge all the doors in the States. Until the manufacture of this article by Mr. Greenwood, America was dependent upon Great Britain for them. There is scarcely an article in the iron or hardware trade but what is, or can be manufac tured at this establishment, extending, even, to music, and other sorts of stools; hat-stands, tables, etc., of tasteful design and finish, and even articles of delicate manufacture \u2014 such as planetariums \u2014 are manufactured, as we noticed. The establishment is divided into several departments \u2014 each under efficient superintendence \u2014 two of the principal departments being under the management of Mr. Folger, and Mr. Yates, who are associated as partners with Mr. Greenwood in what pertains to their own departments. Amongst the heavier description of work turned ont, are those of basement-fronts for stores, as Well as for entire fronts of Btores and houses. The beautiful front with Corin thian pillars, on Carlisle's block in 4th street, are from Mr. Greenwood's establishment, al though now that they are painted and sanded over, it is impossible, almost, to tell the dif ference between them and the stone of which the upper part is built Mr. Greenwood is an excellent example of the many self-made men with which this country abounds, and we are only paying a well-earned tribute, when we say, that for public spirit, energy of character, and large heartedness, we question if the queen city has his match. The read er is referred to our notices of the fire-engine establishment, and mechanics' institution for a few practical samples of Mr. Greenwood's character. At present, when trade is dull every where, there are only about 400 men employed at the works. In ordinary good times, fully 500 are employed. One of the most gratifying facts connected with this establish ment ia that during the long period of 26 years, it has never stood idle for a single day \u2014 although nearly the whole concern was burned down in 1845."], [89, "WINE GROWING AND TRADE OF CINCINNATI. 83 Strangers in the queen city will be much gratified with a visit to this mammoth estab lishment, where they will be most courteously received, and shown over the premises. In the single article of grist mills, large quantities are manufactured, two of the princi pal houses engaged therein, being Messrs. W. W. Hamer & Co., and J. H Burrows <St Co. As is well known, Cincinnati has already earned a world-wide notoriety for its wines \u2014 and judging from the rapid increase in the cultivation of the grape, and manufacture of wine, there is every likelihood of its becoming a rival even to the trade in pork, in its immensity. In connection with the wine manufacture, one of the most notable things connected with this city, is the establishment of Mr. N. Longworth, the celebrated wine-grower. A visit to his wine cellars will astonish the stranger. There will be found upwards of 300,000 dozens of bottles of the Catawba wine, maturing till ready to be sent out The cellars consist of two vaults, 90 by 120 feet, in two tiers, the lower one being 25 feet below ground. One cask, alone there, holds 4,675 gallons of wine. Mr. Longworth has spent many years and a large amount of money, in bringing the Catawba grape to its present state of per fection. In this respect he may be considered the father of the wine trade, there, as well as one of the \" City Fathers.\" His wines find their way all over the United States, to Eng land, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, etc. The \" Sparkling Catawba\" is very like champagne, and the uninitiated in such articles would scarcely know the difference. The wine made there contains about 11 lo 12 per cent of alcohol. As long as Cincinnati lasts the name of Nicolas Longworth will be intimately associated with it, and hundreds of the very lowest and most degraded of the population will, some day, miss his extraordinary benevolence \u2014 which reaches in one form alone, in seasons of distress \u2014 the free distribution of from 300 to 500 loaves of bread every week to the most necessitous poor. In the distribution of his charity he is peculiar, if not eccentric Many stories are told of him in this respect. As one which we have not seen published, and to give an idea of the man, we may mention, that when lately called upon by a deputation for his subscription to assist the \" Lord's poor,\" his reply was, that he had enough to do in taking care of, and looking after, the \" Devil's poor,\" it being, as we have said, the most degraded whom Mr. Longworth makes his peculiar choice. He not only gives away largeiy in bread, etc., but provides houses actually free of rent, to many who are not able to pay for them, and yet such tenants are more trouble to him than those who pay rent He is, altogether, a self-made man. He commenced his career in a very humble capacity, and now, although said to be the millionare of the city, has, apparently, not a particle of pride about him. His house is a princely dwelling, adorned with Borne gems of art in sculpture and painting, of great beauty and value. For example, in his drawing-room is to be seen the first specimen of sculpture ever executed by the celebrated Hiram Powers, and a gem it is. The turn-out of wine in Mr. Longworth's establishment is about 150,000 bottles per an num. Other firms in the city are now engaged in the manufacture of wine. A large German population, now inhabiting the hills around the city, as well as parties on the Kentucky side of the river, are engaged in the cultivation of the vine, and scarcely an inch of ground is to be 6een on the hill-sides but what is covered with vines, growing. The population of Cincinnati is about 200,000. One of the finest views of Cincinnati is to be got from off the top of one of the hills on the Kentucky side of the river, especially any of those a little further west than the city."], [90, "84 CLEVELAND, OHIO. CLEVELAND, OHIO. Cleveland, one of the most important cities of the west, is Bituated on an elevated plateau, 70 feet above the level of Lake Erie, and forms one of the cities on that lake. It is decidedly one of the most beautiful cities in the States, and remarkable for its fine pub lic aud private buildings. It is built upon a gravelly plain, and from it a magnificent view of the lake is seen. The chief business streets are Superior street, Water street, Bank street, and River street The three former are situated on the higher part of the city, whilst River street is between Cleveland proper, and what was formerly termed Ohio City, (on western side of the River Cuyahoga,) but which is now incorporated with Cleveland. Next to Cincinnati, it is the most important commercial town in Ohio, and, from its nat ural position on the lake, forms an important centre for business to all points, and from its manufacturing and commercial enterprise and establishments, it seems destined always to hold a high position amongst the cities of the Union. From the quantity of trees and shrubbery growing in all parts of the city, giving its streets the appearance of groves rather than any thing else, and the garden-plots around the private dwellings, it has been very appropriately termed the \"Forest City.\" To the stranger, who enters it for the first time, he will be forcibly Btruck with its re markable beauty, and spacious streets, averaging as they do, about 120 feet wide. As an entrepot of commerce, it is one of great importance. A large direct trade with the western cities is kept up by railroad and steamers. The latter ply, during the summer sea son, up as far as Lake Superior, touching at the most northerly ports of that immense mining region. From thence, iron and copper are brought in great abundance, and at Cleveland these meet with the coal of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and transported by canal and railroad to Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and other cities on the seaboard. Two very handsome and substantial freestone buildings are in course of erection at the north side of the public square, one of them the United States Government buildings, is in- tended for custom house, post-office, etc. \u2014 erecting at a cost of about $125,000 (\u00a325,000), 60 feet by 100 feet, 62 feet elevation being three stories high. Builder, Mr. W. J. Warner. Government architect, Mr. A B. Young. At another corner \u2014 on same side of square\u2014 is erecting the County Court House, at the expense of the State of Ohio. Builders, Messrs. Smith & Pannell. Architect, Mr. J. J. Husband. When finished, these will form two of the most important and beautiful buildings in the city. Freestone, of which these two public buildings, and many of the private houses are built, is found in great abundance at Amherst, Lorain County, Ohio, and also at Independence, 12 miles from Cleveland. The chief street, for handsome mansions and villas, is named Euclid street, and contains many equal, in magnificence, to those in the suburbs of London, Manchester (Eng.), or Edinburgh or Glasgow (Scot). All of them are surrounded by beautifully laid out gar dens, with the houses placed from 30 to 40 yards from the road-side, and altogether form a continuation of private dwellings, which, for beauty of design, substantiality, and elegance, are scarcely to be surpassed. As regards health, Cleveland is considered remarkably favourable. Situated as it is, the atmosphere, in summer, is delightfully cooled by the breezes from Lake Erie, so that, even the hottest days of July are tempered by refreshing winds, experienced in few other, excepting lake, cities. Altogether, Cleveland possesses within itself all the elements, not only of progressing towards being a much greater city, but all the conveniences, comforts, and luxuries of life. In educational matters, its public schools are large and airy\u2014 (and, of course, all free)\u2014 whilst it possesses private academies and high schools for the higher branches of educa tion. Of colleges, it possesses both allopathic and hom\u0153opathic\u2014 whilst it has 2 or 3 celebrated water-cure establishments."], [91, "CLEVELAND, OHIO. 85 >q) q)iAi pa)aaunoo ay \"99DI{JO JiUI)UUl'i 4R\\^\u00bbHa sb t[a.M sb 'Afisp *[B.iaAas snq puBiaAajQ aq) jo sijud \\\\-e o) maq) Suipuas puB 'asa.C auo ui aaqinn[ jo )aaj uop;[ioi xi9 jo sp.iu.udn sb qaijtu s\u00ab dn 3ui))no (\"og jj> qqoQ 'cuosubjj *9Jssaj*{) \"0)3 -o)a '9aqsB9 'B.ioop 'sAiopuiA*! 2ui5[Bin ui pa -SuSua 'auo[B aug auo \"auo a..\"i.IiJ.

Here, for $2.00 a year, young men can enjoy the advantages of a library of 6000 volumes, (and fast increasing.) besides newspapers, periodicals, etc. The public square occupies about 10 acres of ground, fenced off for public recreation. Foot-paths cross in all directions. In the centre a graceful fountain plays all day, forming a beautiful object. On certain evenings of the week, a very first-rate brass band plays on a raised platform, gratuitously, for several hours, during which time (in the evening) a large turn out of the inhabitants is to be seen, some sitting on the numerous seats pro vided, and some promenading about. This square, and its appropriate \" fixings,\" is one of the most attractive features of the city, and reflects no small credit on the inhabitants who secured it for its present purpose. On the west side of the river, are situated a most efficient system of water works. Two immense stationary engines pump the water up from the lake to a large reservoir, from which the city is plentifully supplied. On same side of the river, a very large population is scattered over a great surface of ground, consisting in part of several very neat cottages. A large proportion of the work ing-classes live on that side of the river; and a stranger cannot but be struck, in summer time, with the neat and comfortable appearance of the dwellings, the most of them being all owned by the inhabitants, and the grapes growing in profusion in the open air, every one being living proofs, in reality, of \" sitting under his own vine, and none daring to make him afraid.\" A large trade is done in wool, bought by the Cleveland merchants, and sent by them to all parts where woollen goods are made.

Property now rents very high in Cleveland, so much so, that many are of the opinion that but for the high rates demanded by land-owners, the city would have made greater progress than it has done, and so long as the present high prices are demanded, it must materially affect the progress of the city in it3 manufacturing and commercial prosperity. Omnibus Line. \u2014 An excellent line of omnibuses is established at Cleveland, by which passengers, arriving per rail, can be set down at any address in town, including luggage, for 25 cents (As. stg.). Mr. Stevens, the proprietor, has upwards of 50 horses employed on it, and, altogether, conducts it in a very satisfactory manner. His \" busses\" call at the hotels for passengers, before the departure of the trains. The baggage is conveyed in a separate conveyance, thus avoiding all trouble and annoyance with it Previous to the arrival of the trains at Cleveland, passengers will be waited upon by the baggage-agent, who passes through the cars ; by giving him their baggage checks and 25 cents, he, in return, will give them an omnibus ticket, which will entitle them to one seat inrthe omnibus, and the conveyance of one or two trunks to any part of the city. This line of omnibuses ply to different parts of the city as a city line, on the same plan as the omnibuses in New York. By purchasing tickets at the office, residents get con veyed, from one point to another, for about 6J cents each trip.

It is situated in Erie County, State of New York, at the eastern extremity of Lake Erie, about 3 miles from the com mencement of the Niagara River. Latitude, 42\u00b0 53' N., Longitude, 78\u00b0 55' W. The site of the city gradually rises from the water's edge, tor about 2 miles, till it becomes about 60 feet above the level of the lake, thus affording, in the higher portion of the town. extensive and beautiful views all around. The lower portion of the town is occupied with merchants' stores, manufactories, etc, and is intersected in different parts by canals. Possessed of a harbour, formed by Buffalo Creek, as it is called, vessels drawing from 12 to 15 feet of water can lay at anchor and discharge and load cargoes, which is done with astonishing rapidity by the steam elevators in operation alongside of the creek. The chief business street is Main street, running in a straight line for about 2 miles, and composed for the most part of spacious and lofty business stores, of every description. Looking from the foot of the street, upward, Main street presents one of the finest com mercial streets we have ever seen. It is 120 feet wide, and there being a gradual ascent all the way up, it is seen to great advantage. Some of the stores in Main street, such as De Witt C. Weed & Co.'s hardware store, Woodward's fancy silk warehouse, and Barnum's variety store, are equal in point of elegance and size to many of those in the Strand or Re gent street, London, Bold street, Liverpool, (Eng)., or Buchanan street, Glasgow, (Scot). The streets where the private dwellings of the upper classes are situated, are of a palatial character, more particularly those of Delaware and Niagara streets. Such streets as these run from 1 to 2 miles, in a straight line, 120 feet wide, with pavement 15 to 20 feet wide, with trees alongside, forming an extensive and beautiful view from either end, whilst a walk along such as Delaware street arrests the attention of the stranger in the magnificence of the dwellings and grounds attached, which are almost all owned by their occupants. There are 3 public squares \u2014 Niagara, Franklin, and Washington. At Niagara Square, no less than eight streets all meet, forming a magnificent \" Eight Dials,\" each stieet running off, from this centre, having its trees on each side, and forming a fine vista in every direction. The commerce of Buffalo is immense, although not so great as it was before the passenger steamboat traffic, on the lake, ceased. At present, it is the greatest grain and flour entre pot on the lake, through which the productions of the great west pass. Here the grain from Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., arrives in vessels carrying from 15,000 to 18,000 bushels each, and is transhipped, by means of the elevators, into canal boats and railroad cars, and sent to all parts of the States, but chiefly to New York. Consequently, ae a grain market, Buffalo stands as amongst the most prominent in the States. The natural position which Buffalo occupies must, of necessity, render it an important commercial city. About 25 miles off, per rail, is Canada. A large Canadian trade is done, whilst the railways from Buffalo, in all directions, render it a convenient centre for business to any particular section of the country. The manufactures of Buffalo are important ; and some large concerns in the manufactur ing of stoves, agricultural implements, machinery of every description, besides foundries, tanneries, etc., etc. Several daily and weekly newspapers are published, amongst which are The Daily Ex press, Daily Courier, Daily Reptiblic and Times, and Advertiser, all having job-printing offices attached, and turning out some of the best specimens of typography we have seen in the States. A large amount of printing for the railway companies is done in the course of the year \u2014 whilst the specimens of wood engraving, executed by such as Mr. Wightman, are equal to any thing we have seen anywhere.

The public free schools of Buffalo have long been distinguished for their excellence and efficiency, and from a visit we paid to one of them, (No. 8, under the management of Mr. Slade,) we can bear testimony to the very excellent arrangements, and system, and the decorum which prevailed throughout\u2014 specimens of writing, etc., of girls and boys 1 years of age, we saw, and difficult questions in mental arithmetic we heard answered, in such a manner, as showed the superiority of the system pursued, and the adeptness of the scholars, very pleasing to a stranger, more particularly when so excellent an education is open to all/free of charge. For the support of public schools, of which there are 33, Buffalo spends $108,000 per annum ; of that, $26,000 is drawn from the State ; the remainder, from taxes imposed for that purpose. There are several other educational establishments, of a higher order, besides literary and benevolent institutions, and excellent public libraries. The transportation trade of Buffalo has lately suffered, in its passenger traffic to the west, the magnificent line of steamers, which was wont to run to the ports on the western lakes', being now -withdrawn. A few emigrants still go with the freight propellers, but the majority of emigrants and others, bound west, from the seaboard, go via the Suspension Bridge, or via Dunkirk and Cleveland. The establishment of railways, therefore, has interfered materially with the passenger traffic through Buffalo, as formerly it was the route through which most passed westward. The conveyance of grain and provisions, which forms 60 large an item in the trade of Buf falo, from the west to the east, and south-east cities and towns, was also in danger, from the railways being likely to monopolize the trade, by carrying it from Chicago and Detroit, via Toledo, Cleveland, and the Lake Shore Railroad, direct to New York and the east. The ingenuity and enterprise of the \" Buffalo boys,\" however, was at once set to work to secure and maintain their city as the chief entrepot for grain, in its passage from west to east, by establishing a line of screw propellers on the stupendous canal, which extends from Buffalo to Albany, getting that canal deepened, and carrying grain and provisions at such low rates, as to teat the railroads out of the field. At the time we write, the first experiment has been tried on the canal with great success. In a future edition, we shall chronicle the further development of this great undertaking. During the year 1858, from the opening of the trade to the 15th of June, we find the imports of some of the leading articles to be as follows, which will give some idea of the large trade done at this port : \u2014 1857. 1858. 1857. 1858.

[Distant from Montreal, 292 ; Boston, 107 ; Quebec, 316 ; Toronto, 625 milee.] During the winter season, when the ice in the St. Lawrence prevents access to Quebec and Montreal, via that route, Portland then forms the link in the chain of communication between Great Britain and Canada for steamers and sailing vessels, as at Portland passen gers and cargo are landed, and forwarded, per rail, to their destination. It having been decided that the Great Eastern Steamship will sail between Portland and England, we annex the following particulars which may prove interesting: \u2014 Portland \u2014 although not the capital \u2014 is the principal town in the State of Maine \u2014 the fnost easterly State in the Union, and adjoining the British Possessions. It is beautifully situated upon a peninsula, rising at the northern and southern extremities into eminences about 200 feet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by Casco Bay, which forms a natural, safe, and spacious harbour for the largest shipping, completely land-locked, except at the entrance, which has been \" scooped out by the hand of the Almighty,\" but is only defended by two artificial fortifications, called Preble and Scammel. Promenades 150 feet in width, two for walking, and another for riding, run round the extremities of Mount Joy and Bramhall Hill, furnishing splendid opportunities for \" constitutionals\" as well as mag nificent views, especially from the Observatory of the town, harbour, shipping, islands, and surrounding country \u2014 on the one hand, stretching right away towards the blue peaks of the White Mountains in the west, and carrying the eye of the spectator right onwards into the azure depths of the blue sea of immensity in the east. When we etate that 24 churches and 16 schools, in addition to numerous edifices belonging to public associations and private parties, have been erected in the town, the tourist must be prepared to anticipate no ordin ary amount of architectural decoration, most prominent amongst which, is a magnificent, marble-fronted hotel in course of erection ; the post-office, constructed of blue granite, and several other elegant structures. The wharfage is extensive and commodious. The Mon treal Ocean Steamship Company's vessels, as well as others bound in a northerly and south erly direction, are easily found, during the winter, at their respective wharves. The Grand Trunk Railway Depot stands convenient for the reception and transportation both of pas sengers and freight to Upper and Lower Canada, while another line of railroad carries the traffic southwards to Boston and New York. Wharves have already been appropriated to the \"Leviathan,\" or, as it has been lately designated, the \"Great Eastern,\" which is ex pected to sail between some port in England and Portland, and the arrival of which will undoubtedly constitute an epoch in commercial enterprise. The population of Portland has nearly doubled itself within the last thirty years ; consequently, the number of deaths, which was only 1 in 70 fifteen years ago, has increased to 1 in 44 \u2014 a fact which is generally at tributed to the great influx of foreigners since the establishment of the Grand Trunk Rail way ; for the site of a town more conducive to the health of its inhabitants could scarcely be found within the limits of the American Continent, in evidence of which, we must not omit to add that it forms most suitable sea-bathing quarters (access to which may be had at a reduction of fare by the G. T. R.) in summer, to Americans as well as Canadians, who can extend their trip with the greatest facility to Lake Champlain, the White Mountains, etc. Population 28,000.

[Distant from Quebec, 724; New York, 680; Suspension Bridge, 229; Milwaukee, 232; Chicago, 284 miles.] \" Detroit, a flourishing city and port of entry of the State of Michigan, and seat of jus tice of Wayne County, on Detroit River, 18 miles above the head of Lake Erie. It is beautifully situated on the W. bank of the river, which is here about half a mile wide, and forms one of the finest harbours in the United States. The part of the city contigu ous to the river is built on a rectangular plan, extending 1200 feet back from the shore; the space beyond this is divided into triangular sections by a number of avenues, which converge to an open area called the Grand Circus. These avenues vary in width from 120 to 200 feet The principal buildings and public offices are situated on Jefferson and Wood ward avenues. The city is adorned with several public squares, one of which is named the Campus Martins. Jefferson avenue, one of the finest streets in the city, is well paved, with brick and stone sidewalks. Woodward avenue, crossing the first at right angles, is the principal business street. Congress street is also distinguished for its fine appear ance. Among the remarkable edifices may be mentioned the old State House, a commodi ous brick building, 90 feet by 60, with a dome and steeple 140 feet high, which commands an extensive view, embracing the city with its environs, Lake St. Clair and the Canadian shore ; the City Hall, which is a brick building 100 feet by 50, and the Bank of Michigan, a substantial structure of stone, in the Grecian style, which cost about $40,000. Detroit has a well-organized system of public schools. It contains 23 churches, 4 banks, a muse um, theatre, and two orphan asylums. The railroad company have a large brick freight house, about 600 feet long by 100 feet wide. Ten or eleven newspapers are published in Detroit, three of them daily, and the others triweekly, or weekly. The city is lighted with gas, and also supplied with water of the purest quality from Detroit River. \"Detroit is admirably situated for commerce, and its importance is greatly enhanced by its intimate and extensive relations with a region towards which a prodigious tide of emi gration is flowing. By its position on the great chain of lakes, and by means of the con necting rivers and canals, it nas a ready communication with the principal centres of trade. \" The manufactures of the city are extensive and important, consisting of steam-engines and various other kinds of machinery, mill-irons, stoves, ploughs, cabinet ware, <tc. Brewing and tanning are also carried on to a considerable extent At the different steam saw mills here in operation, about 10,000,000 feet of lumber are annually turned out. \" The trade of Detroit is immense. Population about 60,000.\""], [99, "CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. 93 CITY OF CHICAGO, (ILLINOIS.) [Distant from St. Paul, 468 ; New York, 955 ; Montreal, 839 ; Milwaukee, 85 miles.] Previous to 1831, this great commercial emporium of the north-west, was a mere trad ing post amidst the wigwams of the Indians, since which time it has reached a population of upwards of 130,000, having doubled itself every 4 years. The city is situated on the south-western side of Lake Michigan, and is intersected into 3 divisions, by the River Chi cago, up which trading vessels ascend for nearly 5 miles. To its central position, with the most extensive means of communication by land and water \u2014 having been continued all the way to Liverpool, (Eng.,) without, transhipment, via the Welland Canal and River St. Lawrence \u2014 may be attributed one great cause for its rapid rise and progress. The ground on which the city stands is an extremely level plain, sufficiently elevated to prevent inundation, and extending many miles towards the south and west Tlie adjacent country consists of beautiful and fertile prairies, interspersed with groves, and diversified by gentle slopes. From a recent published account of this city we quote : \u2014 \" The city is laid out in rectangular blocks, with streets extending nearly north and south, and east and west. The shore of the lake, and the northern parts of the city, are occupied with the finest residences, but the principal business is transacted on the south side of the river, the banks of the south branch being lined with docks and large warehouses. Many of the streets are paved' with planks and lighted with gas. Michigan avenue, which is, perhaps, the most beautiful street in the city, extends along the shore of the lake, and is bordered with shade-trees. Next to, and parallel with this, is Wabash avenue, adorned with double rows of trees. \" The most remarkable public buildings are the new Court House, the Merchants' Exchange, the Marine Hospital, the Medical College, and the Second Presbyterian Church. The Court House is a splendid edifice of Lockport limestone, having a prison on the first floor, the county offices on the second, and a court room and town hall on the third, with a cu pola and roof of galvanized iron. The Marine Hospital is a spacious and handsome build ing, of Milwaukee brick. The Second Presbyterian Church, at the corner of Wabash and Washington streets, in the Gothic style, with a steeple about 200 feet high, is perhaps the most beautiful edifice of its class west of New York. It is built of a kind of pitchy stone, in which black and white are mingled, and presents a singular and striking appearance. Chicago contains several banks, and about 30 printing offices, from which numerous daily and weekly journals are issued. The public schools are well organized, and are accommo dated with excellent buildings.\" Regarding the population and valuation of property in the city, during the last 5 years, we annex the following table : \u2014 population and valuation of Chicago.

The amount of money expended in Illinois, and the neighbouring States, has been about $180,000,000, the disbursement of which has aided in settling, stocking, and working a vast extent of country, the products of which are carried over these roads, more or less directly, to Chicago. \" There has been put in operation 1,500 miles of roads, which have extended the area of country that pours its wealth into Chicago. The projected connections of these roads ex tend over four thousand miles more, making 8,000, and their ultimate ramifications em-"], [100, "94 CHICAGO. brace every section of the Union. Every extension of railroads forms a centre, embracing the breadth of land which feeds that centre, as the square of the distance. From every point of the compass these lengthening roads run from Chicago over the most fertile country. It is therefore not to be wondered at that Chicago Ib the greatest grain depot in the world.\" In the year 1838, only 78 bushels of wheat was exported from Chicago.

In Chicago, during the last five years ending with 1860, when there were no railroads to bring wheat into the city, wheat averaged 75 cents per bushel. In the last five years it has averaged $1.23 per bushel. Corn has aver- aged 50 cents, against 33 cents at former periods. The effect of these prices has been the immense increase in the grain supplies, particularly corn. The $180,000,000 which has been spent in the last-named period for the construction of railroads has, to a large extent, become capital in the hands of cultivators who have produced the grain. The value of the wheat and corn brought to market at theBe two periods was as follows : \u2014 , Five years to 1851. , , Five years to 1858. , Bushels. Price. Value. Bushels. Price. Value. Wheat 9,703,611 75 $7,276,709 31,643,785 $123 $39,554,731 Corn 1,524,936 33 508,212 35,080,113 50 17,540,056 1,524,936 33 508,212 35,080,113 50 17,540,056 Total 11,228,247 .. $7,786,921 67,723,898 .. $57,094,787 \" Thus the value of these two grains alone, received at Chicago, has been equal to an in- crease of nearly $50,000,000, or $10,000,000 per annum. This trade has been developed during the season of high prices abroad, and while the railroads have not operated fully. The corn has been received one-half by the canal, and the remainder by the railroads The wheat baa come to hand nearly altogether by railroads. The teams in the last year brought in about 200,000 bushels, and the canal 880,000 bushels, together 10 per cent, of the whole. '' It is obvious that the business of Chicago has been based on a solid foundation ; that the natural products of an area of at least 200 miles diameter, intersected at every point by railroads, has been drawn into her warehouses, and the fast-settling country has required merchandise in return. The operations for a moment has encountered a check, but cannot be lasting. Prices of grain may decline for the momeDt, but the general trade cannot but increase. The whole machinery is now in operation. If railroad e:xpen-"], [101, "CHICAGO. 95 diture is less, the attractions of the land are greater, and vaBt tracts still invite settlers to add to the future resources of Chicago. \"At this moment, the machinery of production and transportation, in and around Chi- cago, indicates that it is just now entering upon its career. The prices for grain for the moment are dull, owing to good harvests abroad, but the Western country can now sell and deliver cheaper than ever. The railroad expenditure is to be run down for the present ; but it follows that the local demand for food is also less in proportion ; that while the whole industry of the section is turned to production, it depends upon the foreign market only for the sale of its surplus. The earnings of the railroads indicate the immense development of business they have occasioned.\" The number of vessels which arrived at Chicago during 1857 was 7,557, with a tonnage of 1,753,413. \" Chicago, as a lumber market, has for many years stood pre-eminent. Its rise and pro- gress is only equalled by the rapid development of the city as a centre of the territory west of the great lakes ; and, in importance, this branch of its commerce is second perhaps to no other. The river banks are lined for miles and miles with the immense piles of lum- ber which is shipped to Chicago from the pineries of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Canada, and it is perhaps tlie best criterion that could be adopted to comprehend the magnitude of the trade. The capital invested in the lumber business is immense. Not to speak of the property owned by merchants in mills and woodlands, the wealth which is invested in 6tock, in docks, and in real estate in that city, cannot be less than ten or a dozen million dollars. The fleet of lumber vessels alone did not cost less than a million and a half of dollars ; and the number of hands employed in the business, one way and another, cannot fall short of ten thousand. \" With these leading features of the large commerce which is carried on in Chicago, in receiving the produce of the fast-settling prairies, and supplying them with lumber and goods, a large manufacturing business has grown up in the city.

CITY OF MILWAUKEE, (WISCONSIN.) [Distant fi.m Montreal, 787 ; New York, 1040 ; Chicago, 85 ; St. Paul, 431 mile*.] \" Milwaukee, the largest and most important city in the State, and, after Chicago, the most flourishing on the lakes, is situated on the west shore of Lake Michigan, and on both sides of Milwaukee River. It is pleasantly located, partly on the flats bordering the river, and on the bluffs rising abruptly from the lake to the height of some 100 feet. The river, running nearly parallel to the lake in a southerly direction, is navigable for the largest steamboats over two miles from its mouth. \" As the commercial capital of Wisconsin, its situation demands particular attention. The laws which govern trade and travel are, by the improvements and spirit of the age, reduced to two: 1st. The shortest route to market; 2d. The quickest and cheapest mode of transportation. The products of the Northwest seek a market upon the Atlantic coast Heretofore, New York and Boston have monopolized the trade of this region. They will always retain a large share of it ; but the recent improvements in the Canadas, and those projected, are rapidly diverting trade to the valley of the St. Lawrence. Business rela tions are being established between the cities of Quebec, Montret.1, Toronto, and Hamilton, on the one hand, and the Western Lake ports ou the other. As regards New York and Boston, Milwaukee holds the most favourable position of any port on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Taking Buffalo as a common point on all the lines of trade between these ports and those markets, it will be seen : 1st. That Milwaukee, by water communication, has the advantage for time and distance over any place at the south. 2d. For the most direct route to Buffalo, either by land or water carriage, Milwaukee (so soon as the direct communication by the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad is opened) presents the most natu ral centre for all the trade and travel between the Northwest and the East \" As the general direction of Northwestern trade and travel is coincident with the pa rallels of latitude instead of those of longitude, and as Milwaukee is in the same degree as the great Eastern markets, it can be easily seen that all the contemplated and progressing improvements must make it the natural centre or most available common point in the Northwest, whether by the semi-inland route, through Michigan and Canada, or around the Lakes. The advantages of this position will be very strongly developed, so soon as the direct route east, via Grand Haven and Detroit or Port Huron, is opened, and our sys tem of railroads to the Mississippi completed. Its business radius will then extend from below Savanna, 111., in the Mississippi valley, to the extreme Northwest, sweeping in the trade of Northwestern Hlinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, in addition to that of our own State. \" The harbour of Milwaukee is one of the best on the Great Lakes. The river widens at its mouth into a semi-circular bay, 6 2-33 miles from point to point, and 2 1-32 miles across. At the point of approach to the lake, an artificial channel is in progress of con struction. \" This new harbour entrance is 260 feet in width, and will soon be excavated to a suffi cient depth to accommodate the heaviest tonnage of the Lakes, and, when completed, will make it the most accessible and c.paeious on Lake Michigan. The facilities presented by the old harbour \u2014 in improving which the United States expended, in 1 844-5, $50,000 \u2014 will still be preserved. For over five-eighths of a mile between these two entrances, the river is both wide and deep. Nothing but the grossest and most ruinous neglect, on the part of the city and of the United States Government, will ever permit this old harbour to fill up or become useless. \" Milwaukee contains 7 public schools \u2014 and for educational purposes, spent about $15,000 last year ; in addition to which it has a University and Female College in successful opera tion. \" Built upon the high bluffs of Lake Michigan, and the picturesque slopes of the Mil waukee River, this city is unrivalled in beauty of location by any other in the Northwest.

On the other hand, instances are numerous of people coming here with tendency to diseases of various kinds, who have, after a few years' residence, en tirely recovered.

The appearance of the houses, chiefly built of this material, is very striking, and to a stranger visiting the place for the first time, presents an admirable and remarkable sight. Few cities in the country (if, indeed, there are any) have the materials for building more at hand, or of finer quality, than this. Not only quarries of beautiful, light, coloured stone, within the limits of the city, and adjacent to the railroads, but also lime in abun dance for home consumption and exportation. \"As to lumber, the pineries of the north supply the city with 100,000,000 feet annually. \" From the same authority we find it stated that the receipts and exports at this place, the present season, exceed those of Chicago, and there is no reason to show why they may not for the future. \" Milwaukee is one of the largest grain-markets in the world. Probably nine-tenths of the surplus wheat (the staple) of the State, is shipped from her port. So high has Wis consin wheat stood at the Eastern and European markets, that its merchants have been able to sell it for eight to ten cents per bushel above the prices for Illinois and more south ern States. This fact has turned the attention of farmers to raising it, to the exclusion of other grains ; and, while the wheat crop, since 1850, has increased at the ratio of fifty per . cent, per annum, the crops of rye, oats, barley, and corn, have remained stationary, or ad vanced only with the home demand.\" The number of arrivals and departures of vessels during the year 1857 were 4,720. with an aggregate tonnage of 2,009,826. The tonnage of Milwaukee in 185C, was 21,497.50. The manufactures of Milwaukee, are, comparatively speaking, in their infancy\u2014 although it shows signs of great extension in several departments. In 1856, there were 26 breweries in operation, brewing chiefly lager beer\u2014 to supply the German population in the city and country. Of the 75,000 barrels manufactured, about 30,000 were sent out of the city. In the manufacture of its celebrated bricks, fully 300 are employed regularly. MFlour mills, beef-packing establishments, boot and shoe making, clothing and ship-build ing, make up, for the most, the list of manufactures at present. \" Milwaukee is connected by railroads with every section of the Union. The Milwaukee and Mississippi, the Milwaukee and Watertown, east and west, connecting the lakes and the Mississippi River. The La Crosse and Milwaukee, and the Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lac Railroads, each connecting her with Lake Superior. The railroad from Green Bay, through Milwaukee, to Chicago, commonly called the (Michigan) Lake Shore Road, is to her what the Hudson River railway is to Troy and Albany, in the State of New York.\" The foregoing notice of Milwaukee is copied, for the most part, from \"Wisconsin as it is,\" by F. Gerhard."], [105, "NMISNM008IM \u00a30 TVXHVO 'jSrOSIOMVH"], [106, "100 MADISON. \u2014 CAPITAL OF STATE OF WISCONSIN. MADISON. -CAPITAL OF WISCONSIN. \"Madison, the capital of Wisconsin, and seat of justice of Dane, the largest and most productive county in the State, is situated on a rising ground, between two lovely lakes, and is the most magnificent site of any inland town in the United States. On the north west is Lake Mendota, nine miles long and six wide ; on the east Monona, five miles long and three wide. The city is celebrated for the beauty, health, and pleasantness of its loca tion ; commanding, as it does, a view of nearly every characteristic of country peculiar to the West \u2014 the prairie, oak opening, mound, lake and woodland. The surface of the ground is somewhat uneven, but in no place too abrupt for building purposes. The space between these lakes is a mile in width, rising gently as it leaves their banks to an altitude of about seventy feet, and is then alternately depressed and elevated, making tlie site of the city a series of gently undulating swells. On tlie most elevated ground is the State House, in the centre of one of Nature's Parks of fifteen acres, overlooking the ' Four Lakes' and the surrounding city. From this the streets diverge in every direction, with a gradu al descent on all sides. \" To the west, about a mile distant, is the State University, in the midst of a park of 40 acres, crowning a beautiful eminence. On the south side of Lake Monona is a spacious Water-Cure establishment, surrounded by an extensive grove, and presenting a very strik ing appearance on approaching the city. Around Madison, in every direction, is a well cultivated, undulating count.}-, which is fast being occupied by pleasant homes.\" Bayard Taylor, in an account of a visit to the west, thus writes, regarding Madison: \u2014 \" For natural beauty of situation, Madison surpasses any Western town I have seen. It is built on a narrow isthmus, between the Third and Fourth Lakes. On the summit of a mound stands the State House, in the centre of a handsome square of fourteen acres, from whi eh broad, smooth streets diverge, with a gradual descent on all sides. To the west, and about a mile distant, stands the University, on the summit of a hill, or mound, of about equal height. The Madisonians count seven hills, but I could not make them all out distinctly, nor do I think it necessary to the beauty of the place that it should have a forced resemblance to Rome. In one respect it is equal \u2014 in a soft, beautiful, cream-colour ed sto.ie, which furnishes the noblest building material. Many of the business blocks and private\" houses display architectural taste.\" The '.real estate and personal property is estimated at $8,000,000. \"There are twenty-five wagon-roads, seventeen different mail stage routes, diverging in every direction from Madison. Over seven hundred loaded teams have arrived here in a single d;iy, bringing from ten to fifteen thousand bushels of wheat to market, with large quantities of other produce. Nearly 700,000 bushels of wheat alone were marketed here in a singl e year. \" It is, jbre-eminently, the great railroad centre of Wisconsin, and enjoys, in an enviable degree, all those peculiarly favourable advantages. Four great lines diverge here: the Milwaukee and Mississippi; the Milwaukee, Watertown, and Madison ; East and West, con necting the '\u25a0 lakes with the Mississippi River ; and the La Crosse and Land-Grand Roads, running fro m Madison to Lake St. Croix and the City of Superior, at the head of the lake. \" The sy. tern connects with the Chicago, Fond du Lac, and Superior Road, on the east and north, s tnd the Beloit and Madison Road on the south. \" An abui idant supply of building-material is found here.

Population s ibout 13,000."], [107, "101 STATE OF ILLINOIS. ILLINOIS. Illinois, one of the Western United States, is bounded on the N. by Wisconsin ; E. by Lake Michigan and Indiana, from the last of which it is partly separated by the Wabash River ; S. by the Ohio River, which separates it from Kentucky ; and S. W. and W. by Missouri and Iowa, from which it is separated by the Mississippi River. It lies between 37\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 30' N. lat, and between 87\u00b0 30' and 91\u00b0 40' W. Ion., being about 380 miles in extreme length from N. to S., and about 200 in its greatest, and about 140 miles in its average breadth, including 55,405 square miles, or 35,459,200 acres, of which only 5,175,173 acres were improved in 1850, showing an immense capacity for increase of population in^this ex uberantly fertile State, which has scarcely any soil uncultivable. Population. \u2014 There were in Illinois 12,282 inhabitants in 1810; 55,211 in 1820; 157,445 in 1830 ; 476,183 in 1840, and 851,470 in 1850, of whom 445,644 were white males, 400,460 females; 2756 colored males, and 2610 females. Cities and Towns. \u2014 Illinois has a number of thriving towns, and so rapidly do they in crease, that the census of 1850 will be in many eases far below the truth; but, for want of other reliable information, we must adhere to it. Chicago is the largest city, population 130,000; Quincy, 6901 ; Galena, 6004; Peoria, 5562; Springfield, 4533, and Alton, 3875; besides Peru, Rock Island, Bridge Prairie, Waukegan, Belleville, Jacksonville, Joliet, Elgin, St. Charles, and many other flourishing villages. Face of the Country. \u2014 Illinois is generally a table-land, elevated from 350 to 800 feet above the level of the Gulf of Mexico, with a general inclination from N. to S., as indicated by the course of the rivers. This state, generally speaking, may be characterized as level, though there are elevated bluffs on the Illinois River, and still higher ones on the Missis sippi. There is a small tract of hilly country in the S., and in the N. W. is a good deal of broken land. Many of the prairies are quite small, but others are very large ; among the latter is Grand Prairie, extending from Jackson County, in a N. E direction, to Iroquois County, and varying in width from 1 to 12 miles, and even more. This is probably the highest land between the Mississippi and the Wabash. The prairie is everywhere skirted with wood, and on its border is a circle of settlements, which have been here located on account of the timber. The prairies are interspersed with groups of trees, but the timber is generally sparse on them, which, however, seems not to arise from any thing unfavour able in the soil, but from the annual burning of the prairie grass ; for where this is pre vented, a forest of young trees speedily springs up, and farmers are thus enabled to proceed inward with settlements, as it were, tier after tier. The prairies are not generally flat, but gracefully undulating, and profusely decked with the greatest variety of beautiful wild flowers of every hue, which ravish the beholder with delight Minerals. \u2014 Illinois has within her limits a large portion of the great lead region, which she shares with Iowa and Wisconsin. Galena, in the N. W. part of the state, is almost wholly supported by trade in this mineral. Bituminous coal occurs in almost every county, and may be often obtained without excavation. Vast beds are found in the bluffs adjacent to the American Bottom. Copper abounds in the N. part on Plum Creek, and on the Peckatonica River. It has also been found in Jackson and Monroe Counties. Iron is found in the southern part, and is 6aid to be abundant in the north. Lime, zinc, some silver, marble of a fine quality, freestone, gypsum, and quartz crystals are the other min erals. There are salt springs in Gallatin, Jackson, and Vermilion Counties, leased by the State. Medicinal springs, chiefly sulphur and chalybeate, are found in various parts, and one especially, in Jefferson County, is much resorted to. In the southern port of the State is one strongly impregnated with Epsom salts. Others of medicinal properties are found between Ottawa and Peru. Though Illinois presents but few bold or very striking features to the view of the traveller, she is not without her objects of interest to the lover of nature. Climate, Soil, and Productions. \u2014 Illinois, extending through more than 5\u00b0 of longitude,"], [108, "102 STATE OF ILLINOIS. has considerable variety of climate. Though somewhat milder than the Atlantic States in the same parallels of latitude, there is great irregularity in the seasons. Generally there will not fall six inches of snow at one time, which does not lie more than a few days, but at distant intervals the rivers are frozen for two or three months, and the snow lies for as long a period. The summers are hot, but mitigated by the fresh breezes from the prairies. During 15 years, peach-trees blossomed from March 25th to April 20th, and apple-trees from April 1st to May 3d. Iu the same period the earliest frost was September 17th, but sometimes there is none till near the end of October. The southern part, of course, has a milder climate than the northern. Cattle often are unhoused during the whole winter. In agricultural capabilities Illinois is unsurpassed, if equalled, by any state in the American confederacy. In Bome of her river bottoms the soil is 25 feet deep, and the up land prairies are but little inferior in fertility. The Great American Bottom, lying on the Mississippi, between the mouths of the Kaskaskia and the Missouri Rivers, is of exceeding fertility, and has been cultivated for 100 years without apparent deterioration. This bot bom is about 80 miles in length, covering an area of 288,000 acres. On the river side is a strip of heavy timber, with dense underwood, which extends for 2 or 3 miles. The rest is mostly prairie to the eastern limit, which is terminated by a chain of sandy or rocky bluffs from 50 to 200 feet high. This fine region is, however, not healthy, though probably capable of being made so by drainage. The Rock River country is another highly fertile district on the Rock River and its branches. Of the same character are the regions about the Sangamon, Kaskaskia, and other rivers. Other regions of Illinois are fertile ; but those mentioned pre-eminently so, producing not unfrequently 40 bushels of wheat and 100 of Indian corn to the acre. This is especially true of the narrow river bottoms immediately adjaeent to their banks. The prairies of this State are peculiarly favourable to the raising of stock and the productions of the dairy. Blinois stands third in the absolute amount of Indian corn raised in the states of the Union; but, first, if we regard population and the number of acres under cultivation. The other agricultural staples are wheat, oats, Irish potatoes, hay, butter, and cheese. Besides these, large quantities of rye, wool, beans, peas, barley, buckwheat, fruits, garden vegetables, and some tobacco, sweet potatoes, wine, grass-seeds, hops, hemp, flax, silk, maple sugar, and molasses, beeswax and honey, and the castor bean are produced. Of indigenous fruits there are a variety of berries, plums, grapes, crabapples, wild cherries, persimmons, and the papaw (a sweet pulpy fruit, some what like the banana.) Of orchard fruits, the apple and peaeh flourish best, but pears and quinces are cultivated with facility. Of nuts, the shellbark or hickory, walnut, butternut, a white walnut, and pecan, abound. Forest Trees. \u2014 Illinois would not be wanting in timber if it were more equally diffused. The occupation of the country will, however, remedy this deficiency (even in parts where there is now a scarcity) by protecting the young trees from the ravages of the prairie fires. Tlie bottom lands have a rich growth of black and white walnut, ash, hackberry, elm, sugar-maple, honey-locust, buckeye, catalpa, sycamore, (of a size uuknown in the Atlantic States.) cottonwood, pecan, hickory, and oak of various species; and of underwood, red bud, papaw, grape-vine, eglantine, dogwood, spicebush, hazel, green-brier, etc, On the Uplands are post-oak (very valuable for fencing) and other species of oak, blackjack, (use less except for fuel,) hiekory, black and white walnut, linn or basswood, cherry, etc. The white and yellow poplar are found in the southern part of the State, and the cypress on the Ohio bottomi. Commerce. \u2014 Illinois is most favourably situated for internal commerce, being able to com municate with the western, southern, and central parts of the Mississippi valley, by meaDS of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivera, and with the Northern and Eastern States by way of the great lakes. Education. \u2014 On the formation of the State, one section in each township was appro priated for the support of schools, and afterwards an additional income of 3 per cent, on the actual proceeds from the sale of public lands within the limit of the State. One-sixth of these proceeds is appropriated to colleges."], [109, "STATE OF IOWA. 103 IOWA. Iowa, a recently-formed State, west of the Mississippi, is bounded north by Minnesota Territory, east by the Mississippi, which separates it from the States of Wisconsin and Illi nois, south by Missouri, and west by the Indian Territory and Minnesota, from the former of which it is separated by the Missouri, and from the latter by the Great Sioux River. It lies (with the exception of a small projection in the south-east, between the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers) between 40\u00b0 30' and 43\u00b0 30' north latitude, and between 90\u00b0 and 97\u00b0 west longitude, being about 300 miles in extreme length from east to west, and about 208 in breadth, including an area of 50,914 square miles, or 32,584,960 acres, of which only 824,682 were improved in 1850. Population. \u2014 Iowa had 43,112 inhabitants in 1840, and 192,214 in 1850, of whom 100, 885 were white males, 90,994 white females, 168 coloured males, and 167 coloured females. By a State census in 1852, the population was 230,000. Cities and Towns. \u2014 At the census of 1850, Burlington was the largest town in the State; population, 4081. Dubuque, Keokuk, Muscatine, and Davenport have populations varying from 2000 to 5000. Iowa City had a population of 1250. Face of the Country. \u2014 The surface of Iowa is generally composed of rolling prairies, having nothing within its limits which approaches a mountain in elevation. The highest ground in the State is a plateau in the north-west, called \" Coteau des Prairies,\" which en ters the State from Minnesota. A small portion in the north-east, on the Mississippi, is rugged and rocky, and Table Mound, a conical elevation with a flat summit, 3 or 4 miles from Dubuque, is, perhaps, 500 feet high. The State, however, may be generally described as a rolling prairie, crossed by rivers whose banks are skirted with wood. There are said to be some swamps in the north-west portion of the State. Tlie prairies, though sometimes 20 miles across, are rarely more than 5 or 10. Minerals. \u2014 Iowa is rich in mineral resources. A portion of the great lead region of nii nois and Wisconsin extends into this State. The ore is abundant, but lies deeper than on the east side of the river. Lead mines have been opened in Dubuque and Clayton Coun ties. Zinc and copper are also found in the same localities, and in connection with the lead. The great bituminous coal-field of Iowa and Missouri has an extent of near 200 miles from east to west, and 140 from north to south, within the former State, and occupying most of the central and southern portions. Copper has been recently discovered in Cedar County in considerable quantities. Objects of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 The principal claim of this new, and as yet scarcely explored State, on the attention of travellers, must chiefly rest upon the beauty of its un dulating prairies, or its picturesque landscapes. There are, however, a few objects which may be classed among natural curiosities, of which the following are the most prominent Numerous sinks or circular depressions in the surface of the ground, from 10 to 20 feet across, are found in different places, and particularly on Turkey River, in the north part of the State. Small mounds, from 3 to 6 feet high, and sometimes 10 or 12 in a row, are found on the same stream, within 10 or 15 miles of its mouth. A cave, several rods in ex tent, exists in Jackson County, from which flows a stream large enough to turn a mill The Upper Iowa and Makoqueta Rivers have worn their channels through magnesian lime stone rocks, leaving, on their southern banks, cliffs worn by the rain, frost, and winds into resemblances of castles, forts, etc. Climate, Soil, and Productions. \u2014 The peach-tree blossoms in April, fall wheat ripens in July, spring wheat in August, and Indian corn in October. The rivers are frozen over from 2 to 3 months on an average each winter. The soil of Iowa is generally excellent, and of easy cultivation, with prairie and woodland intermingled. The valleys of the Red Cedar, Iowa, and Des Moines (we quote Owen's Geological Report), as high as lat 42\u00b0 or 42\u00b0 31', presents a body of arable land, which, taken as a whole, for richness in organic elements, for amount of saline matter, and due admixture of earthy silicates, affords a com-"], [110, "104 STATES OF IOWA AND WISCONSIN. bination that belongs only to the most fertile upland plains. After passing lat. 42\u00b0 30' north, near the confines of the Coteau des Prairies, a desolate, knobby country commences, the highlands being covered with gravel, and supporting a scanty vegetation, while the low grounds are either wet or marshy, or filled with numerous ponds or lakes, and where the eye roves in vain in search of timber. North of 41\u00b0 30', and between the head waters of the Grand, Nodaway, and Nishnabotona Rivers, the soil is inferior in quality to that south of the same parallel. The staples of this State are Indian corn, wheat, and live stock, besides considerable quantities of oats, rye, buckwheat, barley, Irish potatoes, butter, cheese, hay, wool, maple 6ugar, beeswax, and honey ; and some rice, tobacco, beans, peas, sweet potatoes, orchard fruits, wine, grass seeds, hops, flax, and silk are produced. Forest Trees, Fruit, etc. \u2014 Iowa is, in many places, destitute of timber ; along the rivers, however, it is well wooded, except near their sources. On the intervals between the rivers there are often prairies of from 15 to 20 miles, without so much as a bu6h higher than the wild indigo and compass plant. The greatest scarcity of trees is north of 42\u00b0. Ash, elm, sugar, and white maple grow in alluvion belts of from one-fourth to one mile in width, on the river banks. The other forest trees are poplar, various species of oak, black and white walnut, hickory, locust, ironwood, cottonwood, lime or basswood, and 6ome pine in the northern parts of the State. Oak constitutes the larger part of the timber of the State. The peaeh grows too luxuriantly, and blooms too soon to admit of its being culti vated to advantage. The grape, gooseberry, and wild plum are indigenous. Manufactures. \u2014 As a newly-settled State, Iowa can, of course, have made as yet but lit tle progress in manufactures; though she has within her limits two important elements of manufacturing industry, viz., abundance of coal and water-power. Commerce. \u2014 Iowa has no foreign trade, but is very favourably located for internal traffic, washed as it is by the Missouri on the west, the Mississippi on the east, and its interior traversed by the Des Moines, Iowa, Cedar, and other rivers. The principal articles of ex port are grain, flour, lead, and pork. Education. \u2014 All lands granted by Congress, all escheated estates, and whatever percen tage Congress may allow on the public lands sold within the State, are to constitute a fund, the interest of which, and the rent of unsold lands, together with military and court fines, are to form an appropriation for the support of public schools in Iowa. WISCONSIN. Wisconsin, one of the recently-settled states of the American confederacy, is bounded on the N. by Minnesota, Lake Superior, and the northern peninsula of Michigan, (from which it is separated in part by the Menomonee and Montreal rivers,) on the E. by Lake Michigan, S. by Illinois, and W. by Iowa and Minnesota Territory, from the former of which it is separated by the Mississippi, and from the latter (in part) by the St. Croix River. It lies between 42\u00b0 30' and 46\u00b0 55' N. lat, (if we exclude some small islands belonging to the State in Lake Superior,) and between 87\u00b0 and 92\u00b0 50' W. Ion., being about 285 miles in ex treme length from N. to S., and about 255 in its greatest breadth from E. to W., includ ing an area of about 53,924 square miles, or 34,511,360 acres, of which 1,045,499 were im proved in 1850. Population.' \u2014 This flourishing 6cion of the West has had a growth unexampled even in that thriving region, having increased from 30,945 in 1840, to a population of 805,391 in 1850; of whom 164,221 were white males; 140,344 white females ; 365 free coloured males ; and 216 free coloured females. Cities and Towns. \u2014 Towns are springing up in Wisconsin as if by magic, and a region that but a few years ago was mostly an Indian hunting ground, is now dotted over with them. The principal of these are Milwaukee, population, 20,061 ; Racine, 5111 ; Kenosha, 3455 ; Janesville, 3451 ; Waukesha, 2313 ; Platteville, 2197, and Fond du Lac, 2014. Be sides these there are Beloit, Madison, Green Bay, Ozaukee, Mineral Point, Oshkosh, Water town, Sheboygan, and Manitoowoc, having populations of from 2000 to 4000 each."], [111, "STATE OF WISCONSIN. 105 Face of the Country. \u2014 Wisconsin may be described generally as an elevated rolling prairie, from 600 to 1200 feet above the level of the sea. This State has no mountains, properly so called. Minerals. \u2014 Part of the great lead region extending from Illinois and Iowa is included in the S. W. part of Wisconsin, and is no less rich in the quantity and quality of its ore than in the other states where it lies. The lead is here intermingled with copper and zinc in considerable quantities, together with some silver. In Lapointe. Chippewa, St. Croix, and Iowa Counties, copper is found ; in Dodge County, and on the Black River and other branches of the Mississippi, good iron ore occurs. The other metallic substances are magnetic iron, iron pyrites, and graphite or plumbago. Facts do not justify any expectation of great de posits of copper in the N. W. part of the Slate. A great bed of magnetic iron ore lies south of Lake Superior, near Tyler's Fork of the Bad River, in strata of metamorphic slate. In 1850, 569,921 pigs of lead were shipped from Dubuque and Mineral Point; but 778,460 in 1845. Beautiful varieties of marble have been recently discovered, or made known to the public in the N. part of Wisconsin. Others are blue and dove-coloured, beautifully veined. These are susceptible of a fine polish, and some on the Menomonee are within navigable distance from New York. Objects of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 This State abounds in picturesque objects, in water falls, rapids, bluffs, and beautiful lakes, with clear water and gravelly bottoms. Climate \u2014 This thriving State, which has surpassed every other, except California, in the unexampled rapidity of its growth, is the theme of almost unmingled praise of the tourist and the emigrant from every part of Europe and America. Its beautiful lakes, rolling prai ries, swelling uplands, and \" oak openings,\" (i. e. lands covered with a scattered growth of oak,) fertile soil, its fine angling, abundance of game, and healthy climate, tempt thither alike the permanent settler, the sportsman, and the lover of the picturesque. The climate, though severe, and the winters long, is more regular and more free from those frequent and unhealthy changes that prevail farther south. The lakes, too, exert a mitigating influence, the temperature being 6-J\u00b0 higher on the lake than on the Mississippi side. The lake shore is also more moist, but the State generally is drier than in the same parallels farther east. The diseases consequent upon clearing lands are less frequent, it is said, in this than other new states, owing to the open nature of the country in the oak openings. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The country south of the middle is a fine agricultural region. In the mineral district, W. of the Pekatonica, the country is broken, but, what is unusual in mining tracts, generally well adapted to farming, and especially grazing. But probably the best agricultural section is that E. of the Pekatonica, which has more prairie land, though even here is a considerable portion of timbered land on the rivers and streams. The agricultural capabilities of the northern part of the State, around the head waters of the Black and Chippewa Rivers, and the sources of the rivers emptying into Lake Superior, are small, the surface in part being covered with drift and boulders, and partly with ponds and marshes. The agricultural staples of this State are wheat, Indian corn, oats, Irish po tatoes, butter, and live stock, besides considerable quantities of rye, wool, beans, peas, bar ley, buckwheat, maple sugar, beeswax, honey, cheese, and hay, with some sweet potatoes, tobacco, fruits, wine, grass-seeds, hops, flax, and hemp. Forest Trees. \u2014 There are vast forests of pine on the Upper Wisconsin, the Wolf river, and the tributaries of the Mississippi, N. of the Wisconsin. The other forest trees are spruce, tamarac, cedar, oak of different species, birch, aspen, basswood, hickory, elm, ash, hemlock, poplar, sycamore, and sugar-maple. The oak openings already described, form a pleasing feature in the landscapes of Wisconsin. Manufactures. \u2014 The numerous rivers and streams of Wisconsin, with their frequent rapids and falls, afford great facilities for mill sites of every sort, and her forests and iron for ship and steamboat building. Mr. Hunt, in his Gazetteer, estimates the manufacture of pine lumber at 400,000,000 feet, besides which, large quantities of oak and basswood are sawed into scantling, plank, lath, etc. He also gives the number of barrels of flour manu-"], [112, "106 STATES OF WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN. factured at 100,000, (independent of kinds of mill stuffs in abundance,) of paper, 300,000 pounds, and of shot, 100,000 pounds annually. Education.\u2014 There were in August, 1852, in the State, 2763 school districts, in which were 1664 school houses, mostly frame or log, and valued at $261,986.32. The capital of the school fund in December, 1852, was $819,200.50. It is expected that ere long the lands appropriated for the support of schools will form a fund of about $3,000,000. Public in struction is under the charge of a State superintendent, receiving $1000 per annum. There have been granted for the support of a State university, 46,080 acres of land. There are also other colleges and academies supported by private subscriptions, which are promising institutions. History. \u2014 Wisconsin was formed into a territory in 1836, and admitted into the Union as an independent State in 1848. MICHIGAN. Michioan, one of the more recently settled of the north-western States, occupies two peninsulas, the southern one lying between Lakes Erie, St. Clair, and Huron on the east, and Lake Michigan on the west; and the northern between Lakes Michigan and Huron on the south, and Lake Superior on the north. The whole is bounded north by Lake Supe rior, east by the Straits of St. Mary, Lake Huron, St Clair River and Lake, Detroit River, and Lake Erie (all which separate it from Canada West), on the south by Ohio and Indiana, and on tlie west by Lakes Michigan and Wisconsin, from the latter of which it is partly separated by the Menomonee and Montreal Rivers. Michigan lies between 41\u00b0 40' and 47\u00b0 30 north latitude (if we exclude Isle Royale, a dependency of this State), and between 82\u00b0 12' and 90\u00b0 30' west longitude. The northern peninsula is about 320 miles in extreme length from south-east to north-west, and 130 in its greatest breadth, and the southern about 283 from north to south, and 210 from east to west, in its greatest width. The joint area of the two peninsulas is 56,243 square miles, or 35,595,520 acres, of which only 1,923, 682 were improved in 1850. About two-fifths of the area is included in the northern pe ninsula. Population. \u2014 Though originally settled by the French, the great bulk of the population is from the New England and Middle States. A large portion of the latter is of New Eng land descent. The number of inhabitants in Michigan, in 1810, was 4762 ; 8896 in 1820 ; 31,639 in 1830 ; 212,267 in 1840 ; and 397,654 in 1850, of whom 208,471 were white males, 186,626 white females; 1412 coloured males, and 1145 coloured females. Cities and Towns. \u2014 The towns of this State exhibit the same rapid growth which is so wonderful a characteristic of the Western States generally. Detroit, tbe largest town in the State, had, in 1850, a population of 21,019. The other principal towns are Ann Ar bor, population, 4868 ; Jackson, 4147 ; Flint, 3304 ; Grand Rapids, 3147 ; Ypsilante, 3051; Adrian, 3006; Marshall, 2822; Pontiac, 2820; Monroe City, 2813; Tecumseh, 2679 ; Kalamazoo, 2507 ; Coldwater, 2166 ; and Clinton, 2130. These populations, as iD New England, sometimes include the townships. Face of the Country, Geology, and Minerals. \u2014 The southern peninsula of Michigan, so interesting in its agricultural and economical aspects, is rather tame in its topographical features, as there is no considerable elevation (compared with the country immediately around it) within its whole extent, though the ridge which divides the waters flowing into Lakes Huron and Erie from those flowing into Lake Michigan, is 300 feet above the level of the lakes, and about 1000 above the sea. The country, however, maybe generally char acterized as a vast undulating plain, seldom becoming rough or broken. There are occa sional conical elevations of from 150 to 200 feet in height, but generally much less. The shores of Lake Huron are often steep, forming bluffs ; while those of Lake Michigan are coasted by shifting sand-hills of from 100 to 200 feet in height. In the southern part are those natural parks, thinly scattered over with trees, called, in the parlance of the country, \"oak openings;\" and in the south-west are rich prairie lands. The northern peninsula"], [113, "STATE OF MICHIGAN. 107 exhibits a striking contrast, both in soil and surface, to the southern. While the latter is level or moderately undulating, and luxuriantly fertile, the former is picturesque, rugged, and even mountainous, with streams abounding in rapids and water-falls \u2014 rich in minerals, but rigourous in climate, and sterile in soil. The Wisconsin or Porcupine Mountains which form tlie water-shed between Lakes Michigan and Superior, are much nearer the latter than the former, and attain an elevation of about 2000 feet in the north-west portion of the peninsula. The east, part of this division of the State is undulating aud picturesque, but the central hilly, and composed of table-land. The shores of Lake Superior are composed of a sandstone rock, which, in many places, is worn by the action of the wind and waves into fancied resemblances of castles, etc., forming the celebrated Pictured Rocks ; while the shores of Lake Michigan are composed of a limestone rock. The streams on the northern slope of the Porcupine Mountain have a rapid descent, and abound in picturesque falls and rapids. The north peninsula is primitive, and the southern secondary; but primitive rocks are scattered over the plains of the latter of more than 100 tons weight, most abund ant on the borders of the great lakes, on the flanks of valleys, and where traces of recent floods are appaient. Michigan, in its northern peninsula, possesses, probably, the richest copper mines in the world. A block of almost pure copper, weighing some tons, and bearing the arms of the State, rests imbedded in the walls of the National Monument at Washington. The region from which this block was taken lies ou the shores of Lake Superior, near the mouth of the Ontonagon River. The same mineral abounds in Isle Royale, near the north shore of Lake Superior. Itod, said to be of a very superior quality, is found in a district about 60 miles south-east of the great copper region, as well as in some other parts of Michigan. The other minerals known to exist in this State, whose mineral resources are very imper fectly developed as yet, are lead, gypsum, peat, limestone, marl, and some coal. Au ex cellent sand for the manufacture of the finer kinds of glass-ware is found on the shores of Lake Michigan, as well as Lake Erie. The copper mines in the northern peninsula are es timated to have produced within the past year (March, 1853) nearly 4000 tons of copper, worth, on the seaboard, $1,500,000. Great activity prevails in the mining region this year ; new discoveries are being made, an increased number of hands employed, and addi tional machinery erected. A mass of copper, weighing 5072 pounds, sent from Michigan, was exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Objects of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 The Island of Mackinaw, in the straits of the same name, already visited for its. picturesque beauty, may, probably, become the future New port of the north-western States. In addition to its bold shores, rising to a height of near ly 200 feet perpendicularly above the water, and the charm of its picturesque views and cool breezes, it has the accompaniment of fine fishing in its vicinity ; and the pleasant ex cursions to Sault St. Mary, to angle for the far-famed white fish, to tempt the sportsman and epicure to while away a summer vacation in this vicinity. About 60 miles west of the entrance of the Strait St. Marie, are the celebrated \" Pictured Roeks,\" composed of sand stone of various colours, and worn by the action of the wind and waves into resemblances of ruined temples, castles, etc. One peculiarly striking object, called the Doric Rock, is a colonnade of 4 round pillars, of from about 3 to 7 feet in diameter, and 40 feet in height, supporting an entablature 8 feet thick, and 30 feet across. These rocks extend for about 12 miles, and rise about 300 feet above the water. Sometimes cascades shoot over the precipice, so that vessels can sail between them aud the natural wall of rock. On laying out the track for a railway across the State from Detroit, the engineers encountered a sin gular lake, covered with an accumulation of vegetable matter \u2014 the growth of ages \u2014 but concealing beneath a deep and dangerous, though not extensive lake, which made it neces sary to make a detour from the road. Climate, Soil, and Productions. \u2014 Notwithstanding the severity of the climate in Michi gan, it is moderated by its proximity to the lakes ; yet the temperature of the northern peninsula is quite rigourous. The northern peninsula is favourable to winter grains, but not to Indian corn ; while the southern produces maize, as well as the winter grains, abund-"], [114, "108 STATE OF MICHIGAN. antly. The prevailing diseases are bilious fevers, ague, and dysentery: consumption is rare. Great fertility is the characteristic of most of the soil in the middle and south of the lower peninsula ; mostly free from stone, and of a deep, dark sandy loam, often mingled with gravel and clay. The northern peninsula has a large portion of rugged and poor soil, but its agricultural capabilities are not yet well developed. Portions of it are well tim bered with white pine, 6pruce, hemlock, birch, oak, aspen, maple, ash, and elm. As the wants of the advancing settlements increase the demand, this region can furr'sh large sup plies of lumber from its forests of pine, spruce, etc., manufactured at the fine mill-sites af forded by the rapid streams on the Superior slope of the Porcupine Mountain. Much of southern Michigan is occupied by those beautiful and fertile natural lawns, called oak openings, covered with scattered trees, and free from underwood. Another portion is prairie, and yet another timbered land, covered with black and white walnut, sugar maple, different species of oaks, hickory, ash, basswood, soft maple, elm, linden, locust, dogwood, poplar, beech, aspen, sycamore, cottonwood, cherry, pine, hemlock, spruce, tamarack, cy press, cedar, chestnut, papaw, etc. The prairies are small, and divided into wet and dry \u2014 the latter, of course, being somewhat elevated. The north-west of the lower peninsula is but little known, but recent letters from that region represent it as well timbered, well watered, and fertile ; it, however, has an uninviting aspect from the lakes. On the shores of Lake Huron, near Saginaw Bay, is a marshy district. Michigan is eminently an agri cultural State ; the staple products being wheat, Indian corn, oats, Irish potatoes (for which it is especially favourable), butter, hay, maple sugar, wool, and live stock, with large quantities of buckwheat, rye, peas, beans, barlej-, fruits, cheese, beeswax, and honey ; and some tobacco, sweet potatoes, wine, grass seeds, hops, flax, silk, and molasses. Manufactures. \u2014 In common with the other more recently-settled States, Michigan has not yet had leisure to give much attention to the development of her manufacturing re sources. In 1850, there were in the State 1979 manufacturing establishments, each pro ducing $500 and upwards annually, of which 15 were engaged in woollen manufactures, employing $94,000 capital, and 78 male and 51 female hands, consuming raw material worth $43,402, and producing 141,570 yards of stuffs worth $90,242 ; 64 forges, furnaces, etc., employing $210,450 capital, and 362 male hands, consuming raw material worth $105,865, and producing 5430 tons of castings, pig iron, etc., valued at $300,697 ; $139,425 capital and 98 hands were employed in the manufacture of 10,320 barrels of ale, porter, etc., and 890,900 gallons of whisky, wine, etc. ; and 60 tanneries, employing $286,000 capital, consuming raw material worth $203,450, and producing manufactured leather valued at $363,980; domestic manufactures were fabricated worth $354,936. Commerce. \u2014 Michigan, surrounded as it is by inland seas, is most favourably situated for internal trade, and trade with British America. Her foreign commerce is, however, small, and only amounted, in 1851-2, in imports, to $191,976, and exports, $145,152; tonnage entered for the same year, 66,041 ; cleared, 69,981 ; owned, 46,318.12, of which 24,681.73 was steam tonnage ; number of vessels built, 16, with a tonnage of 2639.00. In the spring of 1853, there were owned at Detroit and Mackinaw, 56 steamers, with a tonnage of 17,926. The lake trade of 1851 has been stated at, imports, $5,330,609, and exports, $5,790,860. Wheat and other grain, flour, pork, live stock, wool, and copper are among the leading ar ticles of export. Education. \u2014 On the subject of education, Michigan is largely imbued with the opinion of New England (from whence so many of her sons derive their origin), that republican gov ernment and common-school education must proceed or fall together. Her school fund, in 1852, was $675,668; in addition to which, is a fund called the University Fund, of $100,000."], [115, "STATE OF MISSOURI. 109 MISSOURI. Missouri, one of the largest of the United States, and the first formed wholly W. of the Mississippi River, is bounded on the N. by Iowa, (from which it is separated for about 30 miles on the N. E. by the Des Moines River,) on the E. by the Mississippi River, which di vides it from Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee; on the S. by the Arkansas, and on the W. by the Indian Territory, from which it is partly separated by the Missouri River. This State lies (with the exception of a 6mall projection between the St. Francis and the Mississippi River, which extends to 36\u00b0) between 36\u00b0 30', and 40\u00b0 36' N. lat, aud 89\u00b0 10' and 96\u00b0 W. Ion., being about 285 miles in its greatest length from E. to W., and 280 in width from N. to S., including an area of 67,380 square miles, or 43,123,200 acres, ODly 2,938,425 acres of which were improved in 1850. Population. \u2014 Though originally settled by the French, less than one-third of one per cent, of the present inhabitants of Missouri are of that extraction. The population amounted to 66,686 in 1820; 140,145 in 1830; 383,702 in 1840, and 682,244 in 1850; of whom 312,987 were white males, and 279,017 females; 1361 free coloured males, and 1257 fe males ; 43,484 male slaves, and 43,938 female. Cities and Towns. \u2014 St. Louis is the largest city in Missouri, population, 77,860, (by a local census in 1853, 88,000;) the other principal towns are Hannibal, population in 1850, 2557 ; Lexington, 2459; Castor, 2084; Weston, 1915; Palmyra, 1284; and St. Genevieve, 958. Capital, Jefferson City. Face of the Country. \u2014 This great State is mostly level or undulating N. of the Missouri River, while S. of this river (much the larger portion of the State) exhibits a much greater variety. In tlie S. E. part, near the Mississippi River, and S. of Cape Girardeau, is an ex tensive marsh, reaching beyond the State into Arkansas, and occupying an area of about 3000 square miles. The remainder of this portion, between the Mississippi and the Osage Rivers, is rolling, gradually rising into a hilly and mountainous district, forming the outskirts of the Ozark Mountains. Beyond the Osage River, at some distance, commences a vast ex panse of prairie land, which stretches away to the Rocky Mountains. The ridges forming the Ozark chain, which probably in no place reach an elevation of 2000 feet, extends in a N. E. and S. W. direction, separating the waters that flow N. E. into Missouri River from those that flow S. E. into the Mississippi River. The geological features of this State are very interesting. One of the richest coal fields perhaps iu the world occupies the greater part of Missouri N. of the Osage River, and extends nearly to the N. boundary of Iowa. A carboniferous limestone, which comes to the surface on the E. and W. borders of the State, forms a rim from 5 to 40 miles in breadth. The lower magnesian limestone crops out on the Missouri River, from 25 miles above Jefferson City to within 35 miles of its mouth, with occasional obtrusions of sandstone. Schoolcraft thus speaks of the Ozark Mountains : \" The Ozark is a term applied to a broad, elevated district of highlands, running from N. to S. centrally through the States of Missouri and Arkansas. It has on the E. the striking and deep alluvial tract of the Mississippi River, and on its W. the woodless plains or deserts which stretch below the Rocky Mountains.\" Minerals. \u2014 Missouri is particularly rich in minerals, and a vast region in the neighbour hood of Iron Mountain is, perhaps, unsurpassed in the globe for productiveness in iron of the best quality. Though existing in the greatest abundance and purity in this locality, this mineral is found scattered throughout the State. In the eastern counties S. of the Mis souri River, large quantities of lead, sometimes mixed with zinc, are found. Copper exists throughout the mineral region, (a tract of 17,000,000 or 18,000,000 acres,) but is most abun dant near the La Motte mines. It is found combined with nickel, manganese, iron, cobalt, and lead, and these often yield 34 per cent, of the pure metal. Of the other metals Darned, all except nickel are found in considerable quantities. Silver exists in the lead ore, 350 pounds of pure silver having been obtained from 1,000,000 pounds of lead. Tin has been found in small quautities. Of tbe non-metallic minerals, limestone abounds N. of the Mis-"], [116, "110 STATE OF MISSOURI. souri River, and forms a good building stone. Marbles beautifully veined and crystalline are found in parts of the State ; also gypsum, sandstones, red and white, porphyries, sienite, saltpetre, sulphate of baryta, kaolin, and inferior clays. The red sandstone is of too coarse and loose a texture for architectural purposes, but the white, found near St. Genevieve, makes superior glass. Porphyries of a red ground interspersed with crystals, admitting of a high polish, are found S. of the Missouri River. Coal. \u2014 Bituminous coal, much of it cannel coal, exists in vast beds in the N. of the State, and has also been found 40 miles up the Osage River. The great cannel coal-bed in Cal laway County consists, in one place, of a solid stratum 24 feet, and in another 75 feet in thickness, and is believed to be the largest body of cannel coal known. Rivers. \u2014 Missouri enjoy6 the navigation of the two greatest rivers in the United States, if not in the world. By means of the Mississippi River, which coasts her entire eastern boundary, she can hold commercial intercourse with the most northern territory of the Union, with the whole of the valley of the Ohio/with some of the Atlantic States, and with the Gulf of Mexico. By means of the Missouri, her other great river, she may ex tend her internal commerce to the Rocky Mountains, besides receiving the products that may be furnished iu future times by its multitude of tributaries. The Missouri River coasts the N. W. of the State for about 200 miles, (following its windings,) and then darts across the State in a direction a little S. of E, dividing it into two portions, of which about a third is N, and the remainder S. of that, river. Objects of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 We shall hardly be able to do justice to Missouri in this respect, in the present state of our knowledge of the interior, as there are doubtless, in ber mountain recesses, gorges, waterfalls, and caves whose fame has not yet reached us. To the geologist the State already possesses ample inducements for a visit ; while the lover of fine scenery wil! find much to interest him in the wild bluffs both of the Missouri and Mis sissippi Rivers, which rise to an elevation varying from 50 to 300 feet Climate. \u2014 The climate of Missouri is very variable : in tbe winter the thermometer sinks below zero, and the rivers are frozen so as to admit the passage of heavily-laden vehicles. The summers are excessively hot, but the air dry and pure. In the autumns, bilious and remittent fevers are common on tbe river bottoms. Pulmonary complaints, however, to such a degree as to terminate in consumption, are infrequent Soil and Productions. \u2014 The soil of Missouri, speaking generally, is good, and of great agricultural capabilities; but the most fertile portions are in the river bottoms, which are a rich alluvion, (in some cases, however, mixed with sand,) and in that portion N. of the Missouri River, except in the E, where a sandy soil prevails. South of the Missouri there is a greater variety in the soil, but much of it is fertile, and even in the mountains and mineral districts there are rieh valleys, and about the sources of the White, Eleven Points, Current, and Big Black Rivers, the soil, though unproductive, furnishes a valuable growth of yellow pine. The marshy district of the S. E. part will, when the population shall have become sufficiently dense to justify the expense of drainage, be probably one of the most fertile portions of the State. The great staple of Missouri is Indian corn, and more hemp is produced than in any State except Kentucky : the other great products are wheat, oats, tobacco, wool, peas, beans, Irish and sweet potatoes, fruits, butter, cheese, pork, hay, flax, honey, and beeswax ; considerable rye, buckwheat, market products, grass-seeds, maple 6ugar; and some rice, barley, wine, hops, silk, and molasses. Forest and Fruit Trees. \u2014 \" Tlie river bottoms are covered with a luxuriant growth of oak, elm, ash, hickory, cottonwood, linn, and white and black walnut. In the more barren districts are found white and pin oak, and sometimes forests of yellow pine. Tlie crab apple, papaw, and persimmon are abundant; as also the hazel and pecan.\" There are three species of wild grape ; and apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and nectarines yield well. Commerce. \u2014 St. Louis is the great centre of internal commerce of the Mississippi and its tributaries, which must greatly increase as the settlements on those great rivers extend themselves. The exports of this State consist mainly of lead, pork, flour, wheat, tobacco,"], [117, "MISSOURI, OR NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. 111 and live stock. Missouri has long been the principal seat of an active caravan trade with Santa Fe Education. \u2014 Missouri has a school fund (in 1852) of $575,668, and another fund of $100,000, called the seminary fund. The interest of the former is distributed among the counties in proportion to the number of scholars in each. In 1850 there were 59,927 chil dren iD the State, of whom 39,983 were in the schools. Annual expenditure for school pur poses, $88,124; number of volumes in school libraries, 6200. Every sixteenth section of pubhc lands is devoted to common schools. MISSOURI, OR NORTH-WEST TERRITORY. Missouri, or North-West Territory, an unorganized territory occupying the vast region lying between the White Earth and Missouri Rivers on the E., and the Rocky Mountains on the W., and (with the exception of a small tract in the S. E., belonging to the Indian Territory) between the Platte River on the 8., and British America on the N. It lies be tween about 40\u00b0 30' and 49\u00b0 N. lat, and between about 97\u00b0 46' and 113\u00b0 W. Ion., covering an estimated area of about 687,564 square miles, or space enough for five States larger than Illinois. This vast tract would include the proposed territory of Nebraska. Population. \u2014 We have no census returns from this wild region, which has been appro priated as the abode of different Indian tribes, among which may be mentioned the Crows, Blackfeet, (a ver}7 warlike and cruel tribe,) Minnetarees, Riccarees, Puncahs, and Pawnees. Face of the Country. \u2014 The greater part of this territory, as far as is known, seems to consist of a high prairie land. A chain of highlands, called the Black Hills, runs from near the Platte River in a N. E. direction to the Missouri River, which they approach in about 102\u00b0 of W. longitude, dividing the waters running into the Yellowstone from those flowing into the Missouri below its great south-eastern bend. On the W., the Rocky Mountains rear their lofty summits, in some instances above the snow line, and send out spurs into Missouri. Fremont's Peak, the loftiest known in this chain in the United States, is on the S. W. border of this territory. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 This extensive tract is traversed by the Missouri, one of the most important rivers in the world, which rises near its south-western border, runs for about 1000 miles in a N. E. direction, to 48\u00b0 20' N. latitude, receiving a large number of afflu ents from the N, one of which, the Yellowstone, is 980 miles in length, and a multitude of sub-tributaries from the S. From the latitude named above, it flows off to the S. E., form ing the eastern boundary for perhaps 1000 miles. In about latitude 43\u00b0 30' the Missouri makes a grand detour, called the Great Bend, \" where the river makes a circuit of 30 miles in advancing 2000 yards in a direct course.\" A number of important streams flow into the Missouri, within this territory, below the bend alluded to, so that this region is well watered, and gives promise of being more suitable for settlement than the country below Platte River. There are some small lakes in the S. W., and perhaps others yet to be discovered and described. Objects of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 The Great Falls of the Missouri, and the gorge below, enclosed with perpendicular rocks 1200 feet high, claim the first place among the striking natural objects of this territory. Animals. \u2014 This country is the paradise of the hunter and trapper. Vast herd3 of buffa lo roam over its prairies, though now rapidly diminishing in numbers. Lewis and Clark have stated that at times the Missouri was backed up as by a dam, by the multitude of these animals crossing. The grizzly bear, Rocky Mountain goat, sheep, and antelope in fest the slopes of the Rocky Mountains ; and the beaver in former times existed in great numbers, though the trappers are now fast thinning them out. Panthers were met with by Lewis and Clark ; also black bears, elks, and wolves. Commerce. The fur and peltry trade constitute the commerce of this vast region. Steamboats ascend the Missouri above the Yellowstone, and up the latter river 300 miles."], [118, "112 MINNESOTA. MINNESOTA Minnesota, a territory of the United States, is bounded on the N. by British America, E. by Lake Superior and the State of Wisconsin, S. by Iowa and Missouri Territory, and W. by Missouri Territory. The Lake of the Woods, with a chain of small lakes and their outlets, form a part of the Northern boundary ; the St. Croix and Mississippi a part of the eastern, and the Missouri and White Earth Rivers the western boundary. It lies between 42\u00b0 30' and 49\u00b0 N. lat, and between about 89\u00b0 30' and 103\u00b0 30' W. Ion., being about 650 miles in extreme length from E. to W., and 430 from N. to S., including an area of nearly 166,000 square miles, or 106,240,000 acres. Face of the Country. \u2014 Though there are no mountains in Minnesota, it is the most elevated tract of land between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson's Bay, aud from its central heights sends its waters to every point of the compass, but mostly to the N. and S. The position from which the Red River of the North and the St. Peter's take their opposite courses is almost exactly in the centre of the territory, and elevated about 2000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico. A plateau, called the \" Coteau des Prairies,\" or \" Prairie Heights,\" about 200 miles in length, and from 15 to 40 in breadth, runs through the middle of the southern part of Minnesota. Its greatest elevation is about 1916 feet above the level of the sea, and its average height about 1450 feet. The northern portion, which is the highest, is about 890 feet above Bigstone Lake, which lies in its vicinity. Passing the St. Peter's or Minnesota River, we come upon another range of height?, known as the \" Coteau du Grand Bois,\" or the Wooded Heights, which extend for more than 100 miles nearly parallel with the \" Coteau des Prairies.\" This ridge is mostly covered with an extensive forest of hard wood. Through the middle of the triangle which occupies the N. E. portion of the ter ritory, runs a third range of heights, called the \" Hauteurs de Terre,\" or \" Highlands,\" which extend W. by S. about 300 miles, and form a dividing ridge, whence flow the waters that seek Lake Superior and the Mississippi in one direction, and Hudson's Bay in the other. A range of less altitude than the \" Coteau des Prairies,\" but continuing in the same direction, forms the watershed of the streams flowing into the Missouri on the W., and those flowing into the Red River on the E. The rest of the country generally alternates between sandhills and swamps, and river bottoms and prairies. In the N, on the Red River, are extensive Savannas, level as a floor, while the central region and the portion between that and Lake Superior is much of it occupied with marshes, separated by hills of drift. West of the Coteau des Prairies, and Red River, the country has been but little explored ; but that portion of it between the Riviere a Jacques and the Missouri is represented as com posed of high rolling prairies. Minerals. \u2014 The indications, from geological surveys of Minnesota, do not favour the hopes of great metallic wealth within its borders. Copper has been found, but in most instances it is not \" in place,\" but appears to have been carried thither by the drift aud boulders. The probability is that, of richer metallic ores than iron, this territory will not afford (ex cept near Lake Superior) sufficient quantity to repay the labours of the miner; for if they exist at all, they probably lie at great depths. The indications are equally unfavourable to there being any large deposits of coal. A lead vein, 4 inches in thickness, was discovered on the Waraju River, by the geological corps of Professor Owen. The most remarkable mineri'd in this territory is the red pipestone, of which the Indians make their pipes, and which is believed to be peculiar to the region of the Coteau des Prairies. Salt is reported to exist in vast quantities between 47\u00b0 and 49\u00b0 N. lat, and 97\u00b0 and 99\u00b0 W. Ion. Lakes and Rivers. \u2014 Minnesota is, perhaps, even more deserving than Michigan of the appellation of the \" Lake State,\" as it abounds in lacustrine waters of every size, from lakes of 40 miles in extent, to small ponds of less than a mile in circuit. These beautiful sheets of water give origin to rivers flowing N., S., and E. ; some finding their way to the Atlantic through the mighty Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico ; others through the great lakes, Niagara, and the St. Lawrence ; and others, again, pass off to the N., and seek the ocean"], [119, "MINNESOTA. 113 through Hudson's Bay and Straits. The largest of these lakes, with the exception of Lake Superior, are the Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake, Red, Minni-Wakan or Devil Lake, Leech, and Mille Lac, or Spirit Lake. These generally have clear, pebbly bottoms, and are well stocked with fish, among which are the white fish, pike, pickerel, maskelonge, sucker, perch and trout Wild rice grows on the borders of many of them, especially at the North. Devil Lake, which is on the 48th parallel of N. lat, in the N. W. of Minnesota, is about 40 miles in length, by 15 in breadth, and its waters, which are brackish, ha-e no visible outlet. Red Lake, on the same parallel, E. of Red River, with which it communicates, is divided into two portions, united by a strait of 2 miles in width, and covers about the same area as Devil Lake. Lake of the Woods, and Rainy Lake, (the former a large sheet of water, perhaps 100 miles in circuit,) are both on the N. E. boundary of the territory. Lake Pepin, a beautiful sheet of water, is a mere expansion of the Mississippi in the S. E. of this territory. The rivers and large streams of Minnesota are almost as numerous as its lakes. The far-famed Mississippi takes its humble origin from Itasca Lake, from whose pellucid waters it issues a rivulet of but a few feet in width, and first meandering in a N. E. direction through a number of small lakes, to receive their tribute, it turns to the S., and pursues its lordly way to its far distant exit in the Gulf of Mexico, laving in its course the shores of nine States and one territory. About 800 miles of its length are included within Minnesota, of which 600 are navigable, 200 below the Falls of St. Anthony, and 300 above. The Rum and St. Croix, tributaries of the Mississippi, drain the S. E. portion of the terri tory, and the Red River the northern, passing off into Hudson's Bay. It is the outlet of Traverse, Ottertail, Red, and several smaller lakes. It has a course of about 500 miles within Minnesota, though it does not flow directly north more than 200 miles in that dis tance. The Lake Superior slope is principally drained by the St. Louis and its branches, and by the outlets of that series of small lakes that form the N. E. boundary of Minnesota. The great valley formed by the slopes of the Coteau des Prairies and the Coteau du Bois is drained by the St Peter's and its tributaries. This river runs first in a S. E., and then in a N. E. course, with a total length of from 400 to 500 miles, and is navigable for steamers, during high water, 56 miles above its mouth in the Mississippi, and 60 farther for keel-boats. Its principal branch is the Blue Earth or Mankota River. The St Peter's, with the Crow Wing and Crow Rivers, are the principal tributaries of the Mississippi from the West. The Riviere & Jacques (re<_ ve-air' ah zhak) and the Sioux are the principal affluents of the Missouri from this territory. They both have an almost directly S. course, the former being about 600, and the latter 350 miles long. Nearly the whole western boundary is washed by the Missouri, which opens the western part of the territory to the commerce of the great Mississippi valley. The rivers of Minnesota abound in small falls and rapids, which, while they interrupt navigation, furnish extensive water-power. Objeots of Interest to Tourists. \u2014 If we except cataracts of the first magnitude and high mountains, Minnesota presents as great a variety of natural objects of interest as any por tion of our widely extended domain. Minnesota shares with Wisconsin in the falls and rapids of the St. Louis River, another picturesque and romantic display of nature's works. The rivers of Minnesota are filled with picturesque rapids and small falls, and often bordered with perpendicular bluffs of lime and sandstone, or gently sloping hills that gracefully recede from the water. This region is the paradise of the hunter: its prairies and forests are the home of many wild animals, and in its rivers and lakes swim great varieties offish. Climate. \u2014 The climate of this territory is severe, especially in the northern part. At the Pembina settlement, under the 49th parallel of latitude, the cold is frequently so great as to freeze quicksilver. Minnesota, in some parts, is too severe for Indian corn, but the dry ness and steadiness of the cold favour wheat and other winter grains. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The 6oil of Minnesota varies greatly. In the valleys of the rivers it is mostly excellent, especially in those of the St. Peter's, and of the Mississippi and its tributaries in the south-east of the territory. Above the Falls of St. Anthony, with the exception of the river alluvions and some prairie land, the country is generally covered"], [120, "114 MINNESOTA. with drift, interspersed with marshes, too wet for cultivation ; but the elevated portion is often much of it of tolerable fertility, though inferior to the calcareous lands of the river bottoms, and not unfrequently covered with dwarf timber. Forest Trees. \u2014 Parts of Minnesota are densely timbered with pine forests, and the ridges of the drift districts with small pine, birch, aspen, maple, ash, elm, hemlock, firs, poplar, and basswood. In the swamps between the ridges, the tamarack, cedar, and cypress are found ; while the river bottoms furnish a good growth of oak, aspen, soft maple, basswood, ash, birch, white walnut, linden, and elm. Much of this timber on the poorer ridges, and in some of the marshes, is rather of a dwarf character. On the Rum, St Croix, and Pine Rivers there are extensive forests of pine, of good, but not of the largest growth. Accord ing to Professor Owen, \" a belt of forest crosses Minnesota in lat. 44\u00b0 30', which is remark able for its unusual body of timber, in a country otherwise but scantily timbered.\" Taken as a whole, therefore, Minnesota can scarcely be called a well-wooded country. But here, as in other parts of the West, when the prairies are protected from fire, a growth of young timber soon springs up. Animals. \u2014 Minnesota has always been a favourite hunting-ground of the Indians, and vast herds of buffalo, elk, deer, antelope, and other game still roam over the plains west of the Coteau des Prairies and the Red River. Deer, black bear, antelope, wolverine, otter, muskrat, mink, martin, wolf, and raccoon abound, and the moose and grizzly bear are occasionally met with. The prairies are frequented by grouse, pheasants, and partridges, and the streams by wild ducks and geese. The other birds are hawks, buzzards, harriers, owls, quails, plovers, larks, and a great variety of small birds. Among the water fowl are the pelican, tern, hooded sheldrake, bustard, broadbill, ruffle-headed duck, wood duck, teal, wild goose, and loon. Both the golden and bald eagle are occasionally met with. The rivers and lakes abound in fine fish, among which are the bass, cap, sunfisb, pickerel, pike, catfish, whitefish, sucker, maskelonge, and trout Manufactures. \u2014 There are great capabilities in the innumerable rivers of Minnesota, with their falls and rapids, for manufacturing establishments. At present the conversion of her pine forests iDto boards, scantling, etc., constitutes the principal manufacture of this new and flourishing territory. The best lands of Minnesota are on her two great navigable rivers, the Mississippi and St. Peter's ; and the first acts of internal improvement needed by this territory will be the removal of some obstructions in these streams. It is among the probabilities that the great Pacific railway ma}' traverse this region, as engineers are now examining the feasibilities of a northern route. Commerce. \u2014 Minnesota has the advantage of two outlets for her productions ; one by way of the Mississippi, to every portion of the Mississippi valley ; and the other by way of Lake Superior, with the Lake States and with the East The great export of this territory is her lumber. Education. \u2014 Minnesota has a public system of free schools, which are under the general direction of a superintendent of common schools, and the local supervision of trustees. Every township containing not less than five families is considered a school district. \" An act to incorporate the University of Minnesota,\" was passed February 25, 1851. This insti tution consists of five departments, namely, of science, literature, and art; of laws; of medicine ; of agriculture ; and of elementary instruction. Twelve regents, appointed by the legislature, manage its affairs. It is located at St. Anthony. The proceeds of all lands granb.d by the United Stales go to form a perpetual fund for the support of the university.

Did you ever hear the anecdote of the Italian and the American, who were discussing the merits of the scenery of the Old and New World, in the vicinity of Niagara Falls? N'lniporte. The Italian wound up his animated description of the beauty and variety of European landscapes with the climax: \"An eruption of Mount Vesuvius, with the Bay of Naples in the distance, forms the most brilliant spectacle in the universe!\" \"Fetch it here, sir,\" said the American, with that sangfroid characteristic of one of Uncle Sam's fam ily, \" and 111 put it out in five minutes !\" That retort reveals the general contrast that characterizes the scenes and scenery of the Old and New World \u2014 the eclipse which is thrown on the former by the latter, by their natural vastness, grandeur, and sublimity, as might easy be illustrated by a detailed study of their physical geography. The surface of Europe is partitioned, by ranges of lofty mountains, into petty nationalities, decorated with pretty gems of beautiful landscapes; the vast basin of the Mississippi forms an immense theatre, walled round by the Rocky Mountains and Alleghanies, fringed with nodding pines, for the reception of an universal brotherhood of humanity. The citieB of Europe are centres of civilization, art, science, and architectural beauty. The cities of America are rather foci of commerce, sites of extensive depots, stores, and hotels, periodically wrapt in flames, and rising, like the Ph\u0153nix, more stately and beauti ful from their ashes. The rivers of Europe drain their surplus waters in their rocky channels, and bear a few light craft upon their swelling bosoms, from the ocean. Floating palaces, the commercial navies and merchandise of the wide world, are borne thousands of miles into the interior of America by the great \" Father of Waters,\" Tlie lochs and lakes of Europe sink into insignificant pleasure ponds beside the \" Inland Seas\" that form the Mediterranean highway between Canada and the United States. The very grass is grazed to European cattle with difficulty ; whereas, herds of wild buf faloes scamper the waving prairie grass like leviathans through the \" vasty deep.\" Bands of plantations, clumps of trees, and roads winding their devious ways over hill and dale, variegate the European landscape ; not so throughout the length and breadth of the boundless Continent of America. Roads run right away in interminable straight lines, crossing each other at right angles. You may wander for miles, with cultivated fields on each side ; but the primeval forest, for the most part, forms the perpetual horizon, and you are compelled to dive into it, on foot, railcar, or buggy, and emerge, not always dry-shod, from its lofty wooden walls. Take your passage on board a steamer, at the mouth of tlie Mississippi, you will sail through all the zones of climate and vegetation between the trop ics and the poles.

The traveller accustomed to enjoying the mountain scenery of Great Britain and Ireland, and finding so much of it within the \" Sea-girt Isle,\" is apt to feel disappointed in travelling over perhaps thousands of miles in America, that he does not find a proportionate amount of scenery of the same character, and that in many long journeys in particular sections of the country, the scenery becomes monotonous, yet we have failed to meet with the traveller who cannot find within the limits of the American Continent, a variety and extent of scenery sufficient to satisfy the greatest reveller in the beautiful and grand in nature, and her works. Variety forms the characteristic of the Bcenery of the New, as well as of the Old World \u2014 although variety arising from the existence of different climates within the vast extent of the North American Continent. Take up your position on the Grampians, in Scotland ; behind you frowns the bleak and barren summits of the Highland hills ; before you gleams the lovely and fertile Carse of Gowrie, extending towards the German Ocean, all within the circle of a few miles in circumference. Perch yourself upon the Rocky Mountains, the blue waters of the Pacific mirror the blue expanse of heaven towards the far west There, your eye will wander right across an intervening continent of numberless hills and valleys, all richly clothed in their coronation robes of summer, only to be changed for others more variegated, but none the less beautiful, when tipped with the first touch of the approaching winter's blast : whilst again, from off some of the highest points in the Alleghanies, the eye rests with unmingled satisfaction as it stretches down the cultivated green swards and waving corn-fields of Pennsylvania, along the charming scenery of the Potomac, and the Susquehanna \u2014 on towards the suburbs of the great cities on the eastern seaboard \u2014 or on the other hand, again, as you turn towards the mighty west, and there catch the first glimpse of that great western world, as it lies teeming with life, on and beyond the Ohio \u2014 about to take another start, ere long, in its extraordinary career \u2014 in the progress of its development And be it remembered, when we speak of North America, we mean our remarks to bear equal reference to Upper and Lower Canada, which claims the better half of the sublimest scene exhibited to the spectator upon the American Continent, viz., the Falls of Niagara. The American boasts of the sail to Staten Island and the Bay of New York, and up the Hudson River; the Canadian, of the sail down the St. Lawrence, threading the Thousand Islands \u2014 shooting the Rapids, and up the Ottawa, outrivalling Lomond's silver loch, stud ded with its islet groves; but both stand, in union, dumb with awe, in silent admiration and contemplation of the perpetual motion of the watery avalanche that has continued to shoot the lofty Rapids, from time immemorial, and will continue to proclaim to the whole world, with its voice of many waters, the unity in variety of the great stream of life that has been incessantly coming out of, and going into, the depths of eternity. In the following pages of this section of the work, we have availed ourselves of a few of some of the choicest scenes in the country, for illustration, and hope that they may some what assist to convey to readers at a distance from such scenes some idea of their beauty and character, which we have no hesitation in saying have only to be visited to be highly enjoyed and appreciated."], [127, "ALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS. 7 THE SCENERY OF THE ALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS. Route frcnn Baltimore to Cincinnati, via Marietta. \u2014 If evidence were wanting to con vince the most sceptical, as to the beauty and grandeur of the scenery in America, we think we have only to refer to the engravings in the following pages! \u2014 of a few views of some of the wildest and most romantic mountain scenery \u2014 which it has been our fortune to witness, anywhere. The tourist who has probably climbed Ben Lomond and other points of Scotia's charm ing scenery, will find in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia a great similarity \u2014 only, that the eye in reaching to the top of the mountains in that portion of the United States \u2014 the hills will be founded densely wooded to their very summit In the summer time therefore, it may easily be imagined the great difference in looking up toward the tops of those hills on the Susquehanna and Potomac, and how much more agreeable to the senses the effect must be, than gazing on the snow-capped summit of Ben Nevis \u2014 or Ben Mac dhui (Scotland). We candidly confess that our previous ideas of Scottish glen and moun tain scenery which 6tood par excellance in our estimation has somewhat been upset. \u2014 when visiting the route in question, and that the scenery of old Scotia must take its rank only alongside that of the Susquehanna and the Potomac. On that account, therefore, we have devoted a greater amount of space than we originally intended to this region of the \"mountain and the flood,\" simply to induce if possible, tourists in search of nature's grandest works, to pay these districts a visit \u2014 before they return home. By their not doing so, they will lose a great treat, and be, comparatively speaking, ignorant of the beauties of American scenery \u2014 a matter on which we fear there is a considerable amount of ignorance and error amongst many who consider themselves even great travellers iu the \"old country\" \u2014 as well as many even in America. These districts now being thoroughly opened up \u2014 the tourist \u2014 the painter \u2014 and the sportsman, has every facility (accompanied with moderate expenditure) for enjoying them selves \u2014 to their hearts content \u2014 without let or hindrance, and the sportsman without be ing obliged to have his game license \u2014 and pay smartly for \"liberty to shoot over the grounds.\" Leaving Baltimore, you proceed on for 9 miles to Washington Junction, at which there is a handsome and substantial stone bridge.

Smith, an intelligent officer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. \" Cheat River is a rapid mountain strce.m, of a dark coffee-coloured water, which is sup posed to take its hue from the forests of laurel, hemlock, and black spruce in which it has its rise. The road crosses the stream at the foot of Cranberry Grade by a viaduct. This is composed of two noble spans of iron, roofed in on abutments, and a pier of solid freestone taken from a neighbouring quarry. Arrived at this point, you enter the ' Cheat River Valley,' which presents by far the grandest and most boldly picturesque scenery to be found on the line of this road, and one of the finest series of railroad views on this conti nent. For several miles you run along the steep mountain-side, clinging, as it were, to the gigantic cliffs, the cars like great cages suspended\u2014 though upon the safest and most solid of beds midway, as it were, between heaven and earth. At one moment the view is confined to the immediate locality, hemmed in on every side by the towering mountain spurs. At the next, a slight curve in the road opens to view fine stretches of the deep"], [134, "14 SCENERY ON THE CHEAT RIVER. valley, with the dark river flowing along its bottom, and glorious views o the forest covered slopes descending from the peaks to the water's edge. VIEW ON THE \"CHEAT RIVER GRADI AT THE TRAY RUN IRON AND STONE VIADUCT, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SEVEN MILE FROM BALTIMORE. The engineering difficulties overcome in the part of the road, within the first few miles west of Cheat River bridge, must have been very great, but the rough places have been made smooth as the prairie levels.

THE POINT WHERE THE RAIL LEAVES THE RIVER AND PROCEEDS ON TOWARDS KINGWOOD TUNNEL."], [135, "SCENERY AT THE GRAFT ro CTIOli 15 point is to ascend along its banks the \" Cheat River Hill.\" The ravine of Kyer's Run, a mile from the bridge, 76 feet deep, is crossed by a solid embankment. Then, after boldly cutting along the steep rocky hillside, you reach Buck-eye Hollow, which is 108 feet below the road level, and finally come to Tray Run, which is crossed at a height of 150 feet above its original bed by a splendid viaduct, 600 feet long, founded on a massive base of masonry piled upon the solid rock below. These viaducts are of iron, and are exceedingly graceful, as well as very substantial structures. The view from this spot, both of the scenery and grand structure which so splendidly spans the immense mountain ravine, is most inspiring. From the great elevation the stream appears to be almost beneath your feet. Passing two great clefts in the mountain, you pass upward across Buckhorn Branch, and half a mile further left, the declivities of Cheat River, which meanders off to the north, and of which is obtained a last glimpse, through a tall arch of forests, reposing in its wealth of wilderness solitude far, far below. At Cassidy's Ridge, nearly a mile from the river, and 80 miles from Cumberland, you enter the great western coal field of the Alleghany range. Here again the road finds a threatening barrier to its further progress. By bursting through the wall of the vast prison-house alone can you hope for an outlet. For awhile, before the entire completion of the road, a track wa\u00ab laid across this steep summit, with an ascent of 500 feet to mile, over which iron for the track westward was hauled by a locomotive engine, which propelled a single car at a time, weighing with its load eighteen tons, at a speed of 10 miles an hour, or mure. This plane, however, was not available for trade and travel ; and so the last westward wall of the Alleghanies was pierced by the Kingwood Tunnel, through which you pass. This subterranean passage, 4,100 feet in length \u2014 not including its \" approach cuts\" \u2014 was made. The entire cost of the tunnel, in all its elements, has ex- ceeded $1,000,000 ! Like all the other tunnels on this road it is now enduringly arched. Leaving Kingwood Tunnel, the line for 5 miles descends along a steep hill-side to the flats of Raccoon Creek, at Newburg Station, 88 miles from Cumberland, and 266 from Bal timore. Two miles west of the Kingwood Tunnel, is Murray's Tunnel, 250 feet long, a regular and beautiful semicircular arch cut out of a fine solid sandstone rock, overlaying a vein of coal 6 feet thick, which is Been on the floor of the tunnel. From Newburg, west ward, the route pursues the valleys of Raccoon and Three Forks' Creek, which present no GRAFTON.

Proceeding on along the main stem of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, you now pro ceed on to Wheeling, and thence per Central Ohio Railroad to Columbus, and from there along one of the best made lines in the country, as well as through the beautiful valley of the Little Miami River, till you reach Cincinnati. Leaving, therefore, Grafton, you now proceed on to Fetterman, where the Turnpike to Parkersburg and Marietta crosses the river. The route from Fetterman to Fairmount has but one very striking feature. The Tygart's Valley River whose margin il follows, is a beautiful and winding stream, of gentle current, except at the Falls, where the river descends, principally by 3 or 4 perpendicular pitches, some 70 feet in about a mile. A mile and a half above Fairmount, the Tygart's Valley River and the West Fork River unite to form the Monongahela\u2014 the first being the larger of the two confluents. A quarter of a mile below their junction, the railroad crosses the Monongahela, upon a viaduct 650 feet long, and 39 feet above low water surface. The lofty and massive abut ments of this bridge support an iron superstructure of 3 arches of 200 feet span each, and which forms the largest iron bridge in America. The road, a mile and a half below Fairmount, leaves the valley of the beautiful Monon gahela and ascends the winding and picturesque ravine of Buffalo Creek, a stream some 26 miles in length. The creek is first crossed 5 miles west of Fairmount, and again at two points a short distance apart, and about 9 miles further west About 11 miles beyond Fairmount we pass the small hamlet of Farmington, and 7 or 8 miles further is the thriving village of \" Mannington,\" at the mouth of Piles' Fork of Buffalo \u2014 thence to the head of Piles' Fork. Numerous tributaries open out pretty vistas on either hand.

After reaching its head at Glover's Gap, 28 miles beyond Fairmount, the road passes the ridge by deep cuts, and a tunnel 350 feet long, of curious shape, forming a sort of Moorish arch in its roof. From this summit, (which divides the waters of the Monongahela from those of the Ohio,) the line descends by Church's Fork of Fish Creek \u2014 a valley of the same general features with the one just passed on the eastern side of the ridge. Passing the \" Burton\" station, the route continues down stream to the crossing of a tributary called \" Cappo Fork,\" 4 miles from Glover's Gap.

Shortly after, the route turns up the ravine of \"Board Tree Run.\" after passing through a high spur at its mouth by a formidable cut mere than 60 feet deep through slate rock. Thence it as cends the eastern bank of the run just named, eutting and filling heavily along a precipi tou\u00a7 hill side, until it reaches the point 43 miles west of Fairmount, where the temporary road leaves the permanent grade. Leaving Board Tree Tunnel, the line descends along the hill side of the North Fork of Fish Creek, crossing ravines and spurs by deep fillings and cuttine% and reaching the level of the flats bordering the creek at Bell's Mill ; soon after which it crosses the creek and ascends Hart's Run and Four Mile Run to the Welling Tunnel, 50 miles west of Fairmount, and 28 from Wheeling. From the Welling Tunnel the line pursues the valley of Grave Creek, 17 miles to its mouth at the Flats of Grave Creek on the Ohio River, 11 miles below Wheeling. Tlie approach to the bank of the Ohio River, at the village of Moundsville, is very beau tiful. The line emerging from the defile of Grave Creek, passes straight over the \" flats\" which border the river, and forms a vast rolling plain, in the middle of which looms up the great \" Indian mound,\" 80 feet high and 200 feet broad at its base. There is also the sepa rate village of Elizabethtown, half a mile from the river bank, the mound standing between two towns and locking down upon them both. The \" flats\" embrace an area of some 4000 acres, about three-fourths of which lie on the Virginia, and the remaining fourth on the Ohio side of the river. The soil is fertile and well cultivated, and the spot possesses great interest, whether for its agricultural richness, its historic monuments of past ages, or the beauty of its shape and position as the site for a large city. About 3 miles up the river from Moundsville, the \" flats\" terminate, and the road passes for a mile along roeky narrows washed by the river, after which it runs over wide, rich, and beautiful bottom landB all the way to Wheeling. (See Wlttcl ing.) The whole length of the road to Wheeling is 78 miles from Fairmount, 201 miles from Cumberland, and 380 miles from Baltimore. THE GREAT INDIAN MOUND, MOUNDSVILLE. From Wheeling proceed per the Central Ohio Railroad to Columbus, thence per Little Miami River Railroad from Columbus to Cincinnati. Passengers from Baltimore and Wheeling going direct to Niagara Falls, proceed on from Columbus via Cleveland to Buf falo, and from there to the Falls. But no one who has not visited Cincinnati, should neg lect'the opportunity of doing bo when at Columbus. Travellers who prefer the more south ern route may diverge from the main stem of the Baltimore and Ohio Road at Grafton, and take its North-western Virginia Branch to Parkersburg. Should the tourist prefer that route, we annex the following particulars: \u2014 From Grafton you now proceed to Parkersburg, 104 miles off. Grafton is pleasantly situated amid some picturesque scenery at the three forks of the Tygart's Valley River, one of the main branches of the Monongahela River \u2014 of which we give an engiaving where the two join near Fairmount\u2014 the great gas-coal region. Clarksburg, Va., 22 miles from Grafton, prettily located in a more open country, is the centre of a grazing district, from which Baltimore obtains a considerable installment of her finest beef.

The country traversed by the road is exceedingly rich in minerals. Of coal, its supplies are inexhaustible. Ten miles east of Parkersburg, you strike the bank of the Little Kanawha River, and bowl down its quiet valley to the Ohio terminus of the North-western Virginia Road, 883 miles from Baltimore. The depot at this place is one of the largest in the United States, being over 800 feet in length. It will safely enclose 75 of the largest class cars \u2014 has storage-room for 16,000 barrels of flour \u2014 and, altogether, is one of the mostfitly arranged railroad stations to be met with. It fronts its entire length on the Kanawha River, and is only about 100 yards from the Ohio. The town of Parkersburg is advantageously located on a high bluff at the junction of the Ohio with the Kanawha. Though civilization has somewhat modified and tamed the natural appearance of the locality, it yet presents much to remind one of the still current legends of the trials and struggles of which it was the scene in the early history of West ern Virginia. There is scarce a point in sight which has not connected with it some tale of bloody massacre, or thrilling hair-breadth escape, or undying deed of bravery in re sistance to savage outrage. The town presents on every side abundant evidence of vigorous growth and extra ordinary prosperity. The town contains six modern-built church edifices, occupied by as many different denominations. It also boasts a sound bank, two daily papers, a number of steam flour and saw mills, and several manufactories. One of the latter, a wooden ware establishment, uses up every particle of wood brought within its walls, turning out every thing in the shape of wooden ware, from a whisky barrel to a match box. Standing upon the bluff in front of the town i3 had a fine view of Blannerhasset Island, a little way down the Ohio River, with its wild and natural beauties. After a brief stay at Parkersburg, you proceed on board the steamers which are lying in wait at the levee to convey you to Marietta. Swinging out into the stream, the vessel proceeds leisurely up the river toward Marietta, some eleven miles distant. From Marietta you proceed by rail to Cincinnati.

Passengers desirous of leaving Columbus for either of these cities, can do so by various routes, as can be seen by our Table of Distances, etc., in connection 'with Columbus. Presuming you wish to go to Baltimore, you proceed via the Central Ohio Railroad, which extends to Newark, through a partially cleared country, with no features of particular interest. Thirty-three mile I distant you reach Newark. The Sandusky, Mansfield, and Newark Railroad, running from Sandusky City, on Lake Erie, here intersects the Central Ohio Rail road, and gives it a connection with north-west Ohio and beyond. The Steubenville and Indiana Railroad also terminates here, and connects at Steubenville with the Ohio River Road to Pittsburg. From Newark, 26 miles' progress briugs the train to Zanesville, the county 6eat of Muskingum, one of the richest counties in Ohio, embracing in its area the valleys of the Muskingum and Licking Rivers, which have their confluence at that point, and abound with mineral and agricultural advantages. The city has a population of about 18,000, and is a neat, well built, and prosperous place. Au hour's ride from Zanesville, through the fertile Leatherhead valley, brings the train to the ancient town of Cambridge, situated at the crossing of the old National Turnpike Road, over Wills' Creek. For many miles on each side of Cambridge, the Central Railroad runs close to, and parallel with, the National Road. From Cambridge the Central Ohio Road continues its course for fifty miles through a rich, rolling country, tlie agricultural features of which, its richness of soil, abundance of heavy timber, aud large herds of stock, will al ways arrest and gratify the eye of the traveller, until you reach Bellaire. At Bellaire you proceed by steamer on the River Ohio across to Benwood in Virginia. Started in the ears from there, you proceed swiftty past Moundsville, Cameron, Welling Tunnel, and other places of interest, and finally approach the western slope of the Alle ghanies. You soon approach to the Monongahela River, above the beautiful towns of Fairmount and Palatine, with the picturesque wire suspension bridge uniting them. The great 620 foot iron bridge, too, by which the railroad crosses the Monongahela, a mile east of Fairmount, stands out as a remarkably strong and beautiful structu.e. The views along the Tygart's Valley River, between the Monongahela and Grafton, for twenty miles, w ith the \"Valley River Falls,\" are among the objects most admired, so far, upon this route. Passengers for Pittsburg go by rail from Bellaire to Steubenville, and thence to Pittsburg. Passengers for Wheeling go by rail from Benwood thence.

THE SUSQUEHANNA AND JUNIATA ROUTE FROM PHILADELPHIA TO PITTSBURG, AND THE WEST. TnE nature of the country along this route is similar, in some respects, to the preceding one;, a portion of the scenery pertaining to the same range of mountains, viz., the Allegha nies. Throughout the entire route, however, taken as a whole, the scenery on the Pennsyl vania line, is much more subdued in character, and does not present so large a proportion of wild, romantic scenery, as is to be seen on the Baltimore and Ohio Road. The Pennsylvania route is one of the great highways, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Western States, and is one of the best managed, and best made lines in the country. The scenery pertains chiefly to the beautiful Rivers Susquehanna and Juniata, and their tributaries, whilst along their banks, as well as in the Wyoming district, views of the wildest mountain, and finest landscape and river scenery, are to be met with. The Susquehanna is the largest river in Pennsylvania, rising iu Otsego Lake, State of New York, and runs through the entire breadth, from north to south, of Pennsylvania, through the windings of the valleys of the Alleghanies, and the coal districts, until it reaches the ocean, in all about 500 miles long. THE GREAT COLUMBIA BRIDGE ACROSS THE SUSQUEHANNA. It is impossible, in our limits, to do any thing like justice to the beautiful Bcenery of this route. To represent such, we have selected a view of the magnificent Columbia Bridge, which crosses the SusquehaDna, near Columbia village. This bridge, which is more than a mile long, crosses the river at a spot where the scenery is particularly pleasing. The river there is studded with numerous islands, reposing, as it were, in a magnificent basin, which, with the lofty hills wooded to their tops, presents a seene of great beauty. Through a portion of the same district flows the beautiful Juniata, an engraving of which we give from a drawing by Jesse Talbot, an American artist. Few rivers in the States afford a finer field for the tourist, or artist, than the Juniata. This river is about 200 miles in length, and takes its rise at the foot of the Alleghany Mountains, and flowing for about 14 miles, falls into the Susquehanna at Harrisburg, Penn sylvania. The country through which it runs, is diversified by limestone valleys, and mountain ridges, in which iron and coal are abundant Tlie scenery along its course, is in the highest degree picturesque."], [144, "SCENE ON THE JUNIATA. 24 SCENE ON THE JUNIATA From all we hear, the beautiful scenery in the State of Pennsylvania, and, in fact, the whole mountain range of the Alleghanies, and the rivers traversing the valleys, are, com paratively speaking, unknown. Now, however, that the communication to and from these districts is so frequent and easy, and that the accommodation for tourists is every year in creasing, we have little doubt but that such scenes as above represented, will be more than ever visited by all in search of the beautiful in nature. Bayard Taylor, the celebrated American traveller and writer, thus speaks regarding the scenery of the Juniata: \u2014 \" At the commencement of June, when the leaves are fully expanded and retain their fresh and beautiful green, the warmth, brightness, and richness of the landscapes of this region are the very embodiment of the spirit of summer. The forests are piled masses of gorgeous foliage, now stretching like a rampart over the hills, now following some winding water-course, and now broken into groves and clumps, dotting the undulations of the grain and grass fields. In the trim and careful beauty of England, and the broad gar den of the Rhine plain, one sees nothing of this prodigality of bloom and foliage \u2014 this luxury of nature.\""], [145, "MINERAL RESOURCES IN STATE OF MISSOURI. 25 MINERAL RESOURCES OF MISSOURI. The Iron Mountain, of which we give a sketch, affords one of the most imposing samples of the mineral wealth of the State of Missouri which we could possibly present. Iron Mountain is situated in St. Francois County, in the south-east part of Missouri, a few miles from Potosi, where valuable lead mines are situated, the ore yielding 70 to 80 per cent, of metal. It is about 440 feet high, and 1-J miles long. The yield of ore is 60 per cent, of pig, of a quality said to be superior to Norwegian or Swedish iron. Dr. Feuchtwanger estimates that between Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob \u2014 another such mine of wealth in the same state \u2014 there are 600,000,000 tons of iron ore. Regarding the Iron Mountain it is said \"its whole top is a solid mass of iron, and one sees nothing but iron lumps, as far as the eye can reach.\" A plank road extends from Iron Mountain, a distance of 42 miles, to St. Genevieve, a port on the Mississippi, 61 miles below St. Louis, to which the manufactured ore is shipped from the works at Iron Mountain. A railroad is in progress of being laid, which will form the connecting link between St. Louis and Iron Mountain. Regarding the general mineral resources of Missouri, we may here quote from a writer on this subject : \u2014 \"The mineral region of Missouri occupies an area of about 18,000,000 acres. As early as 1718 it was described in a French chart as 'au pays plein de mines.' It extends from the head waters of the St. Franeis to the Maramec River, a distance of about 70 miles in length, and from the Mississippi, in a south-westerly direction, about 60 miles. The eleva tion of the district above the sea level varies from 600 to 1,200 feet The climate is equable and salubrious, and the superincumbent soil moderately fertile. No one of the mining districts of Europe enjoys such facilities of supporting a large population. Except ing gold aud platina, most of the important and useful metals and ores are known to exist in Missouri. The following minerals, metallic and non-metallic, arranged here according te their intrinsic value, have been found within its limits \u2014 lead, iron, copper, cobalt, silver, nickel, zinc and calamine, manganese and wadd, coal, rock salt, barytes, sand and quartz. carbonate and sulphate of lime, alumine and potter's clay, fuller's earth, variegated marble and oolite, saltpetre, antimony, tin, tungstate of iron and lead, diamonds, chalcedony and feldspar, and some others of perhaps a minor importance. \"The lead mines have been wrought since the first settlement of the country. Tlie ore is in the form of sulphuret and carbonate, and in the upper mines at Potosi it is found mixed with calamine and blende. The lead region extends over the counties of Madison, St. Francois, St. Louis, Washington, etc. Formerly the carbonate was considered as worthless, but it is now reduced iu blast furnaces, and yields 72 per cent. The sulphuret yields from 66 to 80 per cent, and contains about 6 per cent, of silver. Iron in the form of hematite, and the ochrey, the micaceous and red oxydes, are found in the greatest abundance. Tho ores exist throughout the mineral region, and extend even into the coal formation, which occupies so large a surface. Abundant, easily manufactured, and the trensportation ea*y, this is essentially the staple of Missouri. The mines of copper are chiefly found in the Bouth and west portions of the mineral region, but exist in other parts. The ore is of every variety, and usually very rich. It is found in combination with lead and iron, frequently with manganese, cobalt, and nickel, and occasionally with silver. It is generally pyritous, but oxeydes and carbonates are frequently found. The ores appear as a cement uniting angular fragments of lime rock, forming a breccia, and much of it is easily removed by a pickaxe alone. As a general thing the yield is about 34 per cent of metal. The copper mines of Missouri are said to be more valuable than even those of Lake Superior. The several metals found in combination with the above, namely, silver, zinc, manganese, cobalt, nickel, etc., give an additional value to the mines; and as tin has been found near Caledonia, it may be said of Missouri, that no other state or county is richer in metallic wealth, or has better prospects of future prosperity.\" Another writer says: \" Geologists say that the rock on the west side of the mountain be longs to the lower Silurian limestone era. The boring of Belcher's Artesian Well, tells us that this same bed of rock, which forms the surface of the country on the west side of the mountain, is in the well 2,000 feet below the bed of the Mississippi River, a dip of 2,800 feet from the mountain to St. Louis. Geologists say that this dip was necessary to form the great basins which contain coal in the central part of Illinois. On the east side of the mountain a granite country is found.\""], [146, "THE IRON MOUNTAIN, MISSOURI."], [147, "27 KANSAS AND NEBRASKA. THE VALLEY OF THE MISSOURI. In our description of the western por tion of the States, we have concluded for the present not to extend the limits of our information further west than that of the Missouri Valley \u2014 and although Nebraska and Kansas formed no part in the original plan, in the publication of the work, yet, from the great emigration movement in that direction, of late, we have thought it advisa ble to give the following details of that won derful region, although not from our own experience, not having as yet had an oppor tunity of penetrating so far west. In some future edition of this work, we may be able to present such, from our own observation \u2014 meantime, we compile from what appears to us to be a reliable notice of this territory, which appeared in the North American Re view, for July, 1858, in a review, in that journal, of two works lately published on that part of the Union. After describing that portion of the coun try west of Nebraska and Kansas, which is considered to be undesirable as a field for emigration, the writer asks: \u2014 ness \u2014 at least, for heavy goods \u2014 will enable it to outbid all competitors.\" . . . . \" The Co lumbia River, while it forms one vast and navigable stream from the ocean to the centre of the Oregon plains, flares out at the latter point into three forks, each of which offers a pass, and the only passes here accessible through the Rocky Mountains. It is the Co lumbia alone that holds the keys to the passes of the mountains, from which, on the eastern most side, run the tributaries of the Platte. The forks of the Columbia will, therefore, have one side of them the only navigable waters leading to tlie Pacific, and on the other the only highways through whose mountain gates the locomotive can course to the Missouri Valley.\" That the Platte and the Kansas are incapable of navigation, we think is abundantly proved ; but it 19 equally clear that the valleys through which they run are the natural courses through which the canal must be opened and the railway laid. Thus there will pour into the great depots which these frontier States will pre sent, not only the products of Eastern and Western America, but those of China and India. \" What effect will the important fact have on these young territories themselves, as well as ou the country at large ? Nebraska and Kansas will, in that case, be the shores at which will terminate a vast ocean desert, nearly 1000 miles in breadth. To the west of that He California and Oregon, great pro ducing, and yet not capable of becoming great manufacturing countries. \" On the eastern coast of this great desert sea will lie Kansas and Nebraska, of all coun tries the best suited for the sites of vast man ufactories. There run rivers whose descents, and whose capaciousness adapt them as well to turn tlie wheel as to irrigate the land. There, underdeath a soil which can support a million of workmen, are spread layers of coal which will form the fuel for tens of thousands of square miles. There is the iron which is to form both the engine and the staple \u2014 the arm that strikes, as well as the material which is struck. Here, in fact, are the great furnishing warerooms, where the people of California will exchange their gold and quicksilver, and those of Oregon their fish and lumber, for the hardware, the cloths, and the furniture which the manufactories of the Missouri galley will produce. . . . Freight amounting to five dollars per 100 weight will be a sufficient protection to force the manu factories of the Missouri Valley at once into energetic action.\" If manufactured there, heavy goods will be able to be sold 20 per cent, less than those brought from tlie facto ries in Connecticut or Pennsylvania. \" When the time comes for the inland transportation of the goods of India and China from the Pacific to the Atlantic, it will be found that there is one route whose cheap- The corn and wheat prairies of Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas, stand on the banks of that great river (Missouri) which, with a volume, a force, and through an extent of territory no other stream can equal, shoots down the freight committed to it on the vast corn consuming plains of the Southern Mississippi. .... Never was there such an avenue for such a freight. For 500 miles these magnifi cent prairies slope upward from the river banks. For 1000 miles it dashes down, with a velocity which enables even the 6lower class of steamboats to make the descent in from 15 to 20 miles per hour. It is here that the Missouri has the great advantage over the Mississippi. The prairie country is scarce ly reached by the latter river \u2014 so far as con tinuous navigation is concerned The navigation of the Missouri, on the other hand, continues nearly 1000 miles beyond where that of the Mississippi stops It is on ac count of the cheapness and rapidity which transportation in such a channel gives that we think the market of the gulf country will be supplied from the valley of the Missouri \u2014 not from that of the Mississippi. The Extent and Character of the Soil. \u2014 \"The bottom lands, of which the base of this seam (the Missouri) is composed, form a plain extending from 5 to 25 miles in breadth, and accompanying the river through nearly its whole course.\" The soil is of a very shifting nature, and the course of the river very cir cuitous. \" Tt doubles and curves, for instance, to such an extent around a line of 100 miles, between Leavenworth and Nebraska City, as to make that 100 miles into 200. What is"], [148, "28 THE VALLEY OF THE MISSOURI. RIVER MISSOURI. STEAMING UP THE popularly called the ' western bank,' is, by turns, the southern and the eastern.\" For farming purposes, therefore, the lands of that nature are very uncertain and precarious. In its conrse, however, it leaves, on the one side or the other, a i*ich bottom, which, for immediate productiveness, has probably no superior in the world. \" To this are add ed uniform belts of forest trees, interposing themselves between the bottom and the blnffs, which, along the States of Iowa and Missouri, and the opposite shores, develop themselves in great beauty. These trees, in connection with the stone with which the bluffs are often filled, give building materials to the settler in the richest abundance. In Nebraska, the fertile bottom lands on the Missouri River begin near the mouth of the Vermilion River, on the 97th meridian, about 50 miles from Sioux City, and about 1000 miles on the river-course from the Mis sissippi. The trees on the river bottoms are immense and luxuriant. West of Sioux City, the bottom lands become narrow and irregu lar, and give only an uncertain prospect of support. The soil on the table prairie lands, which lie back from the bluffs, is not suscep tible of much cultivation \u2014 degenerating into a cold and desolate moor. The exception to this is a patch, 60 miles above the Big Sioux, at the mouth of the Eau-qui-Court, which there runs into the Missouri. MNo point be yond the Vemilion can be relied on to raise corn. The MPlatte Riveb Valley. \u2014 The valley of the Platte is sodded with firm, and yet nutri tious grass, which affords a road for wagons, and food for the oxen or mules by which the wagons are drawn. Along this great high way, the emigration from the Atlantic to the Pacific will pass. In the bottom lands of the Platte, cotton wood of excellent quality is to be found ; and above and around the forks, cedar in consid erable quantity is to be seen. The width of the Platte is, generally, one mile; and, when full, is 6ix feet deep, but rarely is so: consequently, is considered of no use for navigation purposes. The arable prairies that arise from the bluffs by which the Platte is hemmed, do not spread to any considerable extent after the first 150 miles of its course are passed. The region south of the Platte presents a much wider sweep for agricultural enterprise. There, a climate not yet infected with the parching heat of the low country, is united with a soil of eminent frnitfulness; and, as the arable lands begin to widen, they disclose one of the loveliest regions in the world. The arable lands extend from 150 to 200 miles from the river banks. The Composition and Peoductiveness of the Soil. \u2014 The general character of the bottom lands \u2014 not only of the Missouri, but of the Kansas, the Yellowstone, and the Platte \u2014 is of sand and clay, richly impregnated and saturated with carbon, and with the vast quantities of decayed vegetable matter which the rivers are constantly precipitating."], [149, "29 CLIMATE OF KANSAS AND NEBRA3KA. Not unusually, Indian corn to the amount of 150 bushels to the acre are produced, with scarcely any more preparation than the ordi nary turning over, which is easily done by the plough. From the river basin, rise ter races, or subsidiary bottom, at an average of 60 feet from the river level, and sloping and sweeping away till they reach, sometimes, the prairies themselves. For permanency, depth, richness, and ex tent, the prairie soil can find nothing in the world, to say the least, to excel it \u2014 many parties declaring that there is nothing to equal it Unlike the bottom lands, which are soft and pliable, the prairie lands of the Missouri are tough and tenacious. In Nebraska and Kansas, as many as six or eight yoke of oxen are employed at a single plough in breaking the ground for the first time. When once upturned, however, the sod rots in a single summer, after which it may be ploughed by a single yoke. Indian corn and potatoes grow upon it after the first ploughing ; wheat not until after the second. Omaha City, at 110. It is an error to seek the causes of these extremes in the as yet un settled condition of the country. They result from the fact, that as we recede further from the sea-coast, both heat and cold become, in their degree, greater, as can be explained on philosophic grounds. Two features, however, tend greatly to soften the\u00bbe extremes. The winter is relieved by the crisp dryness of the air, as compared with the piercing sharpness of the Atlantic seaboard, or the raw, damp, cold atmosphere of Great Britain. The Breezes on the Prjiiries. \u2014 The sum mer \u2014 to those who can take refuge in the shade \u2014 has nearly all its terrors removed by the cool and powerful breezes by which the prairies are incessantly swept. It is in these breezes, in fact, that consists one of the main charms of prairie life. In their uniformity, their bracing purity, their vigour, they rival those of the sea. They are greatly preferable, in these respects, to those that traverse the eastern Alleghany slopes. There, the wind is fractured into puffs, or slit into threads by the forests, gorges, mountain crags, and ravines, through which it passes. But the breezes of the prairies pass onward in one grand and unbroken sheet. They blow with the evenness and continuity of the eastern trade winds, which may always be relied on, and in summer, at least, is as far from sinking at one time into a calm, as from rising into a hurricane. In winter the wind then covers the prairies with a cold and heavy weight, whose very uniformity aggra vated its severity. But in the summer, the delicious coolness and the unfailing regular ity of the prairie winds are blessings to which all travellers will bear a grateful testimony. In connection with this subject, we quote from a writer in C'olburn's New Monthly Mag azine for July, 1858, who, on an excursion to the \" Great West,\" and close to the Missouri, says :\u2014 The present appearances of the prairies of the Missouri show clear evidence of having, some centuries ago, been under cultivation, the fields, etc., being clearly traced. They are found in the best- watered and richest sec tions, and extend from one to three hundred acres in area. Lumber. \u2014 In respect to forests, south-east ern Nebraska and Eastern Kansas have a great advantage over Illinois and Iowa. In the latter States we may travel for miles with out seeing a single tree within sight In the central valley of the Missouri, the cotton wood, willow, and poplar spread them selves in great abundance and beauty along the bottom lands, and on the bluffs are found the oak, elm, cedar, and the black walnut, thus providing abundant material on the spot for building and fencing. Climate. \u2014 Between the Missouri Valley and the same range of latitude towards the east, the advantages, so far as evenness of temperature is concerned, are with the latter. Both in Kansas and Nebraska the thermom eter ranges from 15 degrees higher in sum mer, and 15 degrees lower in winter, than in Virginia or Pennsylvania. It is not uncom mon for the mercury to sink to 30 degrees below zero in the one season, and to keep steady in the other, even as far north as \" The west of America must be a healthy country, except where the land is low or near sluggish mud-banked rivers, for there inter mittent fevers prevail as well as elsewhere. There seemed in the midst of the excessive heat, a power of exertion, a springiness, not at all like the faint, relaxing sensation of a very hot English summer's day. I speak of the dry prairies of the west. The air was always clear, dry, exhilarating beyond idea.\""], [150, "30 MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD BRIDGE, IOWA. _ O 13 fl _ \u00ab U 41 TJ _\u25a0 g _\u00b0 \u00ab1?,3 S g Sg 0rc\u00abSF- .a s .2 s \u00ab C a 2 i* .3 fe rr. *. t.

PAUL. A correspondent, who made this trip last summer, has furnished us with the following notes, which we have illustrated with several sketches of some of the most important places and objects of interest on the route. He thus writes: \u2014 It may be as well to say, that tourists, bent on this trip, can take the railway cars from either Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, or any of the principal points of rail terminating at Prairie du Chien. At 11.30, __, M., therefore, we left Milwaukee (Wisconsin) by the train, on a most lovely day, a fresh breeze tempering the blazing heat of old Sol, which rendered his rays more agreeable. After whirling along pretty rapidly and smoothly, we found ourselves at a station called the Y station, a little beyond the town of Milton, and the junction of the line from Chica go, where the tourists and travellers, going to Prairie du Chien and North, meet with those from Milwaukee. Started from this point, we bowled along over the beautiful sward of what is considered up there the unrivalled roek-prairie. Gliding swiftly along, we in course of time, (4, p. m.,) reached Madison, the capital of \"Wisconsin. (See Madison.) Started from Madison, we pursued our journey down the valley of the Black Earth \u2014 named so, we presume, from the rich, black soil of the valley \u2014 whose richness, some say. will never wear out, and never require manure. After passing through the ever-varying landscape of that beau tiful valley, we soon reach Mazomaine \u2014 where there is an excellent refreshment saloon."], [152, "32 UPPER MISSISSIPPI \u2014 SUNSET. From this stopping-place, we proceeded on, with the shades of evening beginning to close upon us, till we reached the valley of the Wisconsin, and through some neat villages which the rail has called into existence. The Wisconsin, which flows here \u2014 the cars crossing it 3 times \u2014 is something of the character of the Missouri, rather shifting in its course, render ing, by its sand banks, the navigation rather difficult By and by, we arrived, at about 9, p. m., at Prairie du Chien. (See Prairie du Chien.) Having alighted from the car3, we soon found ourselves on the bank of the mighty Mis- sissippi. Arrived, therefore, at Prairie du Chien, the tourist will find his way on board the \" Mil waukee,\" or some other steamer in waiting \u2014 unless it be that some of last year's steamers have \" gone up in a cloud of smoke,\" or down into the \" fearful abyss,\" in a determined heat with some opposition boat, since last July. On board the \" Milwaukee,\" however, we found ourselves, a little after 9, P. m., bound for the \" Far West,\" still scarcely realizing any thing particular, but that we were embarking on board at Gravesend on a trip up the Thames to London, only that the splendid steamer, and her comforts, (unknown in river navigation in Great Britain,) brought us to our recol lection that we were, as some Americans would say, \"considerable\" from home, being at Prairie du Chien, about 1300 miles from New York, and some 4800 miles from London, (Eng.,) and with other 300 miles up the Mississippi before we reached St. Paul. First thing to do, was to secure a state-room for the night, which being done, we soon found ourselves in the upper part of the vessel, seeing what we could all \"by moonlight alone.\" Nothing, however, was to be seen but the mighty river stretching far in front and behind us. As we were not to start till next morning, we were soon compelled to seek the retirement of our 6tate-room for the night. Next morning found us at an early and excellent breakfast, after which we were on deck. At 9, a. m., the night mail train, from Milwaukee and the East, brought up the mails and passengers, which, after being all safely on board, we started off on our way north. Having formed the acquaintance of some pleasant company, on board, we soon found our selves sometimes playing at draughts, hearing music, or admiring the beauties of the river scenery, and so morning, noon, and evening, passed away. The scenery on the river is truly fine ; in some parts the little islands forming, with their green-clad vegetation, a miniature \" Thousand Islands.\" The sides of the river were covered, for the most part, with their summer attire of _hrub bery, the high bluffs showing forth in bold relief. By-and-by we reach La Crosse and Wcnona, two of the best looking, and busiest towns on the Upper Mississippi. Between these two towns and Trempeleau, the scenery became very tine, and what, with a beautiful sunset, (sunsets scarcely known in Britain,) beamed forth a perfect blaze of rich crimson light, tinting the islets on the river, and the tops of the bluffs on each side, altogether forming a panorama beyond our powers of de scription. Gradually the sun departed in the western horizon, and withdrawing with him the glorious scene before us \u2014 till at length it disappeared \u2014 leaving us only the very short interval of twilight, before we again found ourselves in the saloons, all lighted for the enjoyment of the night. Any one who has the good fortune to see such a sunset on the Mississippi will never forget it. It is different from the sunsets, even in Canada, New York, and on Lake Erie, but still more different, from what may be seen from off Hampstead Heath, when the loud hum of the day's bustle in London, (Eng.,) is dying away toward the close of the day \u2014 from off Edinburgh Castle, when the sun is receding behind the hills in Stirlingshire, sending his lurid glare of light down the Firth of Forth, till it touches the Inchkeith Lighthouse, and lighting up the whole of the new town of Modern Athens, (Edinburgh, Scot.,) and gilding, with his rays, the tops of the hills in Fifeshire, Perthshire, and other portions of the highlands of Scotland \u2014 or when he would be bidding farewell to the day, as he tinted up the tops of the high hills, between Taymouth Castle, and the pass of Killiecrankie, sending a flood of light down the glens and valleys of Loch Tay, and Kinloch Rannoch.

That evening we went up the Mississippi ; there was a very gay and happy company on board, so towards evening, the music brought some of the company to their feet to dance, till at last it ended in a regular ball. The time flew rapidly past, as may be supposed, amidst such excitement and hilarity, till at length the \" wee short hour\" on the other side of 12 announced it was bedtime. Some of the party sat up on the upper deck all night, to enjoy the scenery of Lake Pepin (which we had now approached) by moonlight Lake Pepin is 35 miles long, 2 to 5 miles wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep. Sometimes it blows hard on this lake, so much so, that the river-boats, not being constructed to stand either a \" sou'- wester\" or a \" nor'-wester,\" sometimes lay-to all night, till it is safe for them to venture further. On this occasion, it was a beautiful night, so we went a-head on its placid waters. About 2, a. m., we passed the \" Maiden Rock,\" on the lake, and shortly afterwards we were again on the river, the lake forming a large expanse of the river, similar to the lakes on the River Ottawa, C. W., forming in succession as they do that beautiful river. The town of Prescott was next reached. Situated at the mouth of the St. Croix River, it is the most nrth- westerly town of Wisconsin. The location is a very pretty one, and we understood it continues to be a fast rising town. By-and-by, about 9, a. m., we descried the \" city\" of St. Paul \" looming in the distance.\" After passing the business portion of the town, we landed at the wharf there, and set foot on the terrritory of the far-famed Minnesota, and in its capital, St Paul. ST. PAUL. On our visit, St. Paul, like every other place, was affected with the prevailing epidemic, of \" hard times,\" which had checked the ardour of some of her speculative citizens quite as much as it had done those of older cities. Consequently the town was dull, and also most of the people in it All, however, with plenty of pluck, confident, that ere long, the little north-west city must of necessity go a-head again, and not stop till she is up sides with some of her south and easterly sister cities. Unlike most American towns, the streets of St. Paul are narrow, which we fancy will be regretted ere long. The streets, moreover, like those of New York, were dirty, and in bad order, but no doubt that in time will be rec tified. The suburbs of St. Paul, however, are very beautiful, and many of the private resi dences, on the higher parts of the town, are very handsome and attractive. The population of St. Paul is variously estimated at from ten to fifteen thousand, of which a large propor tion \u2014 probably a third \u2014 are foreigners ; it contains a capitol and other public buildings, seven or eight churches, among which are two Episcopal, two Roman Catholic, two Pres byterian, and one or two Methodist and Baptist. The Romanists are also putting up a fine college, decidedly the handsomest public building in the place. The limestone, with which the whole town is underlaid, affords an admirable building stone, being very durable, hand some, and distributed in layers so as to be most conveniently worked. There are three daily and three weekly papers published, which seem to have a large circulation, and to be ably conducted. There are also two German and a Norwegian paper, and one or two other small publications. The principal street fronts the river for about two miles, and is lined with large stores of all kinds, to supply the increasing trade of that north-westerly region. The principal hotel is the Fuller House \u2014 a magnificent house, erected at a cost of $100,000, and fitted up with every modern comfort and convenience. There are five railroads in this State, just commencing, or in course of completion : the Minnesota and Pacific \u2014 running from St. Paul to a point on the Missouri River ; the North- western \u2014 from St Paul to Lake Superior; the Cedar Valley and Minneapolis \u2014"], [156, "SAINT PAUL\u2014 CAPITAL OF MINNESOTA TERRITORY.

These roads are all in progress, and Minnesota will soon have her network of rail ways, which will develope her resources, and give her a proud position among her sister States. (See View of St. Paul, next page.) En passant, we may mention, that some of the merchants of St. Paul, who import their goods from Britain, do so direct from Liverpool via New Orleans, thence per steamer on the Mississippi. The saving is such, that the whole cost of transportation from Liverpool to St. Paul is very little more than the mere charges of transhipping at New York, and the freight from there to St. Paul. We have no doubt many importers on the other ports on the Mississippi and the Missouri will be following the example of the St. Paul merchants, the inland carriage from the Atlantic seaboard being extremely heavy on goods bound for the west and north-west provinces.

On both sides of the road the landscape is beautiful, now and then showing glimpses of the Mississippi in the distance. At length we reached St Anthony.

After crossing the suspension bridge, we soon found ourselves in Minne apolis, and at the celebrated Falls of Minnehaha \u2014 \" the laughing water\" \u2014 \" the smile of the great spirit\" \u2014 which will be found the prettiest little fall imaginable, complete in all its parts. A clear, sparkling stream comes rushing along the prairie, until it suddenly takes a leap of 60 feet over the precipice, and is lost in a deep dell, the sides of which are covered with shrubbery of luxurious growth. The rock over which the stream leaps, has been worn into an arch, and one can pass to and fro underneath, between the falls and the rock, with little or no inconvenience. The recess behind the fall extends back nearly 50 feet, and, from that point, an extraor dinary beautiful view of the fall is obtained, as the sun shines on the outside of it. The tou rist ean pass in at one side behind the fall, and find egress at the other side. From the world-wide known Indian poem of Hiawatha, by Longfellow, we annex a few verses, descriptive of the scene now under notice: \u2014 And as musical as laughter; And he named her from the river, From the waterfall he named her Minnehaha, Laughing Water. \" Only once his pace he slackened, Only once he paused or halted \u2014 Paused to purchase heads of arrows Of the ancient arrow-maker, In the land of the Dacotahs, Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and gleam among the oak trees, Laugh and leap into the valley. \" Was it here for heads of arrows, Arrow-heads of chalcedony, Arrow-heads of flint and jasper, That my Hiawatha halted In the land of the Dacotahs? \" There the ancient arrow-maker Makes his arrow-heads of sandstone, Arrow-heads of chalcedony, Arrow-heads of flint and jasper, Smoothed and sharpened at the edges, Hard and polished, keen and costly. 11 Was it Dot to see the maiden, See the face of Laughing Water, Peeping from behind the curtain ; Hear the rustling of her garments From behind the waving curtain, As we see the Minnehaha Gleaming, glancing through the branches, As one hears the Laughing Water From behind its screen and branches?\" \"With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter, Wayward as the Minnehaha, With her moods of shade and sunshine; Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate, Feet as rapid as the river, Altogether, it is a beautiful sight, in a most romantic spot, and should not be neglected by the tourist when at St. Paul. About 2 miles from the Falls, is situated Fort Snelling, sitting on the crest of a bold promontory, between the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers. iSee Fort Snelling.) Before leaving St. Paul, the tourist will find a cave about 2 miles from the town, worthy of a visit It is a subterranean curiosity in its way. Through it flows a stream of water, pure as crystal. The rock overhead is quite soft. To penetrate it, one or two guides are necessary with lights. Near the further end of it, there is said to be a small waterfall, and all in search of the wonderful underground should visit it to its utmost extremity. Start ing from Milwaukee on Tuesday forenoon, we thus spent that night on board at Prairie du Chien, Wednesday night on board on Lake Pepin, and landed in St. Paul on Thursday morning at 9 o'clock. Saw all about St. Paul on Thursday ; went to see the Falls and Fort Snelling on Friday, and returned to St. Paul on Saturday; Sunday, went to a neat little church\u00b0there (Episcopal). On Monday afternoon, at 4 o'clock, we started on our return trip, accomplishing the distance from St Paul to Prairie du Chien, 302 miles, in 17 hours, being fully 7 hours less time than we took to go up\u2014 the stream, of course, being against us on our upward trip."], [160, "40 LAKE SUPERIOR AND PICTURED ROCKS. LAKE SUPERIOR. One of the trips now enjoyed by hundreds every year, from different parts of the Uni ted States and Canada, is that made by the splendidly appointed steamers which sail from Cleveland (Ohio) to the head of Lake Superior \u2014 touching at Detroit aud Mackinaw. Passengers will also find steamers from Chicago for same points. Tlie distance for the whole trip round is about 2000 miles. Time occupied about 8 days. Fare, $44 (\u00a38 16<_, 6tg.,) including the very best accommodation and meals. In the summer season, it is one of tlie most delightful and invigorating trips which can be taken. The commerce of the Lake Superior districts, as is well known, consists chiefly in copper and iron, from the mines situated in different parts. The value of copper shipped in one year, from Ontonagon \u2014 the largest mining depot, and second town in size on the lake \u2014 exceeded $1,000,000 (.2200,000, stg.). From Marquette, it was expected that 200,000 tons of iron would be shipped last year. The other mining establishments are at the towns of Eagle River, Eagle Harbour, Cupper Harbour, Bayfield, Lapoint, Bay City, Ashland, Grand Island City, Du Luth, etc., etc. The City of Superior, situated on the Bay of Superior and Nemadji River, at the head of the lake, is the most important town. It was laid out in 1853. The population in January, 1857, was over 1,500\u2014 with 340 houses. In addition to being approached from Cleveland and Chicago, it is also reached from St. Paul, Minnesota, via the St. Croix and Brule Rivers, per canoes. With regard to the climate of the Lake Superior country, many erroneous impressions are entertained. Professor David Dale Owen, the government geologist, in his report, says: \u2014 \"The health, even of the more marshy portions of this district, seems better than, from its appearance, one might expect. The long, bracing winters of these northern latitudes exclude many of the diseases which, under the prolonged heat of a southern climate, the miasm of the swamp engenders. At the Pembina settlement (in latitude 49\u00b0), owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, to a population of five thousand there was but a single phy sician, and he told me, that without an additional salary allowed him by the Company, the diseases of the settlement would not afford him a living.\" Another writer says: \u2014 \" None of the American lakes can compare with Lake Superior in healthfulness of climate during the summer months, and there is no place so well calcu lated to restore pressing miasms of the fever-breeding soil of the Southwestern States. This opinion is fast gaining ground among medical men, who are now recommending to their patients the healthful climate of this favoured lake, in preference to sending them to die in enervating southern latitudes. \"The waters of this vast inland sea, covering an area of over 32,000 miles, exercise a powerful influence in modifying the two extremes of heat and cold. The uniformity of temperature thus produced is highly favourable to animal and vegetable life. The most delicate fruits and plants are raised without injury, while four or five degrees further south they are destroyed by the early frosts.\" Amongst the exports from there, we find \" 10 tons of Raspberry Jam,\" consigned to a party in Cleveland. THE PICTURED ROCKS, LAKE SUPERIOR. The subject of the sketch on the next page, is one of the most extraordinary natural cu riosities which the region of the far north districts of America present. The \" Pictured Rocks\" are situated on the eastern shore of Lake Superior at its outlet at St. Mary's River. The author of \" Wisconsin as it is,\" in his description of Lake Superior, says: \u2014 \" But its greatest attraction is the ' Pictured Rocks,' which commence at this point and extend east about ten miles, and are so called from the varions forms and colours presented by the rocks forming the shore of the lake. These rocks are of fine laminated sandstone, rising from 150 to 300 feet above the water level, and received the name of ' Pictured' from the brilliant colours formed from the oxides and eulphurets of metals, and vegetable fungi, which, by combination, form the most various pictures, and which, by the least imagination, assume the forms of ancient temples, religious processions, prairies, buffalo hunts, portraits, humorous scenes, until one is almost persuaded he is looking upon the magnificent masters, and not of nature. Among these, cataracts, falls and rivulets are pitching down in mighty volume, or dissipating their torrents into smoky mist.\""], [161, "HOiaadHS 3M3VT 'SHOOK OaHIlXOM 3HX"], [162, "DESCENT OF THE RAPIDS OF THE ST. LAWRENCE. 42 DESCENT OF THE RAPIDS ON THE ST. LAWRENCE. One of the most exciting trips, we believe, to be enjoyed in America, is the descent of the rapids of the St. Lawrence, in one of the steamers which now ply between To ronto, Kingston, and Montreal, affording a treat of no ordinary description, so far as the rapids are concerned\u2014 even in themselves\u2014 but doubly so, when, in the same trip, the far-famed scenery of the Lake of the Thousand Islands may be seen to great ad vantage, as the steamers, which descend the rapids, pass through them. For a descrip tion of a descent of the rapids we copy the following from Hunter's Guide to the St Lawren STEAMERS DESCENDING LOST CHANNEL, LONG SAHLT RAPIDS, ST.

FROM A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN AT BROCK VILLE, CANADA WEST"], [165, "43 LAKE OF THE THOUSAND ISLANDS AND RAPIDS. LAKE OF THE THOUSAND ISLANDS. The steamer, after leaving Kingston, C. W., or Cape St. Vincent, on the American side shortly after approaches the far-famed Lake of the Thousand Islands. These islands appear so thickly studded that the appearance to the spectator, on approaching them, is as if the vessel steered her course towards the head of a landlocked bay which harred all further progress \u2014 coming nearer, a small break in the line of shore opens up, and he enters between what he now discovers to be islands, and islands which are innum erable \u2014 now he sails in a wide channel between more distant shores, again he enters into a strait so narrow that the large paddle boxes of the 6teamer almost sweep the foliage on either side as she pursues her devious course \u2014 now the islands are miles in circumference, and again he passes some which are very small, shaded by a single tiny tree occupying the handful of earth which represents the \" dry land.\" On all, the trees grow to the water's edge, and dip their outer branches in the clear blue lake. Sometimes the mirage throws its air of enchantment on the whole, and the more distant islands seem floating in mid heaven \u2014 only descending into the lake as a nearer approach dispels the illusion, and when the rushing steamer breaks the fair surface of the water, in which all this loveliness is re flected as in a mirror \u2014 to quote the words of Warburton, \" the eye does not weary to see, but the head aches in even writing the one word \u2014 beauty \u2014 wherever you steer over this sweet scene beauty \u2014 beauty still.\" To see and really enjoy and appreciate the charms of the Lake of the Thousand Isles, one ought to visit it in a small boat, and spend many days amid its labyrinths; but we are on board a steamer, and must be content with the passing glance which her rapid and noisy course affords. An honr, or less even, and we are through, \u2014 the Islands and the mighty Ontario are left behind, and we now emerge into the majestie river, though not to disappointment, for ail is grand and beautiful still. As the steamer proceeds onwards the traveller, as he looks on the river from time to time, will soon remark that the current gains strength, eddies begin to sweep round in wide circles, and the upheaving surges, gently at first but angrily as you proceed, boil and roar around and beneath your vessel \u2014 on she goes, faster and still faster \u2014 look ahead, the white-crested breakers meet your eye; while you look, you are in the midst of them, and again you are out into smoother but still rapid water. In this way you pass down the upper rapids \u2014 the Galops, Point Iroquois, and some others which do not strike you as any thing remarkable. But now the water becomes again agitated, and boils and roars as it rushes down the Long Sault LONG 8AULT RAPID, ON THE ST. LAWRENCE. This is a continuous rapid of nine miles, divided in the centre by an island. Tlie usual passage for steamers is on the south side. The channel on the north side was formerly considered unsafe and dangerous; but examinations have been made, and it is now descended with safety. The passage in the southern channel is very narrow, and such is the velocity of the current, that a raft, it is said, will drift the nine miles in 40 minutes. SHOOTING THE LONG SAULT. This is the most exciting part of the whole passage of the St. Lawrence. The rapids of the \" Long Sault\" rush along at the rate of something like twenty miles an hour. When the vessel enters within their influence, the steam is shut off, and she is carried onward by the force of the stream alone. The surging waters present all the angry appearance of the ocean in a storm ; the noble boat strains and labors; but, unlike the ordinary pitch ing and tossing at sea, this going down hill, by water, produces a highly novel sensation, and is, in fact, a service of some danger, the imminence of which is enhanced to the ima gination by the tremendous roar of the headlong, boiling current. Great nerve, and force, and precision are here required in piloting, so as to keep the vessel's head straight with the course of the rapid ; for if she diverged in the least, presenting her side to the cur-"], [166, "44 DESCENDING RAPIDS OF ST.

Hence the necessity for enormous power over her rudder; and for this pur pose the mode of steering affords great facility, for the wheel that governs the rudder\" is placed ahead, and, by means of chain and pulley, sways it. But, in descending the ra- STEAMER DESCENDING ONE OF THE RAPIDS OF THE ST. LAWRENCE. pids, a tiller is placed astern to the rudder itself, so that the tiller can be manned as well as the wheel. Some idea may be entertained of the peril of descending a rapid, when it requires four men at the wheel, and two at the tiller, to insure safe steering. Here is the region of the daring raftsmen, at whose hands are demanded infinite courage and skill ; and, despite of both, loss of life frequently occurs. Large steamers, drawing seven feet water, with passengers and the mails, leave the foot of Lake Ontario in the morning, and reach the wharves at Montreal by daylight, with-"], [167, "45 ROUTE ON THE ST. LAWRENCE. out passing through a single lock. At some of the rapids there are obstacles preventing the descent of deeply-laden craft ; but the government are about to give the main chan nel in all the rapids a depth of ten feet water, when the whole descending trade by steam will keep the river, leaving the canals to the ascending craft. After passing Cornwall (which is the boundary line between United States and Canada) and the Indian village of St. Regis opposite, the steamer approaches Lake St. Francis. LAKE ST. FRANCIS. This is the name of that expansion of the St Lawrence which begins near Cornwall and St Regis, and extends to Coteau du Lac, a distance of 40 miles. The surface of this lake is interspersed with a great number of small islands. The village of Lancaster is situated on the northern side, about midway, of this lake. Coteau du Lao is a small village, situated at the foot of Lake St. Francis. The name, as well as the style of the buildings, denotes its French origin. Just below the village are the Coteau Rapids. Cedars. \u2014 This village presents the same marks of French origin as Coteau du Lac. In the expedition of Gen. Amherst, a detachment of three hundred men that were sent to at tack Montreal, were lost in the rapids near this place. The passage through these ra pids is very exciting. There is a peculiar motion of the vessel, which, in descending, 6eems like settling down, as she glides from one ledge to another. In passing the rapids of the Split Rock, a person, unacquainted with the navigation of these rapids, will almost invol untarily hold his breath until this ledge of rocks, which is distinctly seen from the deck of the steamer, is passed. At one time the vessel seems to be running directly upon it, aud you feel certain that she will strike ; but a skilful hand is at the helm, and in an in stant more it is passed in safety. Beauharnois is a small tillage at the foot of the Cascades, on the south bank of the river. Here vessels enter the Beauharnois Canal \u2014 with 9 locks \u2014 and pass around the rapids of the Cascades, Cedars, and Coteau, into Lake St. Francis, a distance of 14 miles. ' On the north bank, a branch of the Ottawa enters into the St. Lawrence. The river again widens into a lake called St. Louis, 24 miles long. From this place a view is had of Montreal Mountain, several miles distant. In this lake is Nun's Island, which is beautifully cultivated, and be longs to the Gray Nunnery at Montreal. There are many islands in the vicinity of Montreal, belonging to the different nunneries, and from which they derive large revenues. La Chine. \u2014 This village is 9 miles from Montreal, with which it is connected by railroad. The La Chine Rapids begin just below the town. The current is here so swift and wild, that to avoid it, a canal has been cut around these rapids. This canal is a stupendous work, and reflects much credit upon the energy and enterprise of the people of Montreal, At La Chine is the residence of Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Com pany, and of the officers of this, the chief po3t of that corporation. It is from this point that the orders from head-quarters in London are sent to all the many posts through out the vast territory of the company ; and near the end of April each year a body of trained voyageurs set out hence in large canoes, called maitres canots, with packages and goods for the various posts in the wilderness. Two centuries ago, the companions of the explorer Cartier on arriving here, thought they had discovered a route to China, and ex pressed their joy in the exclamation of La Chine ! Hence, the present name, or so at least says tradition. Caughnawaga. \u2014 This is an Indian village, lying on the south bank of the river, near the entrance of the La Chine Rapids. It derived its name from the Indians that had been con verted by the Jesuits, who were called \"Caughnawagas,\" or \"praying Indians.\" This was probably a misnomer, for they were distinguished for their predatory incursions upon their neighbours in the New England provinces. The bell that now hangs in their church, was"], [168, "46 ROUTE ON ST. LAWRENCE \u2014 TRENTON FALLS. the \" proceeds\" of one of these excursions. The Indians at Caughnawaga, subsist chiefly by navigating barges and rafts down to Montreal, and in winter by a trade in moccasins, snow shoes, etc. They are mostly Roman Catholics and possess an elegant church. The village of La Prairie is some seven miles below Caughnawaga, or Village of the Rapids, after which tlie steamer sails on for a few miles, and reaches the city of Montreal. (See Montreal.) NIAGARA FALLS TO THE LAKE OF THE THOUSAND ISLANDS. BT STEAMER ON AMERICAN SIDE OF ST. LAWRENCE. From the outlet of the Niagara at the Fort of that name ro the boundary line 45\u00b0, the entire littoral is in the State of New York, and comprises in succession the counties of Ni agara, Orleans, Monroe, Wayne, the northern corner of Cayuga, Oswego, Jefferson, and St. Lawrence. The last, along its entire western frontier, and a half of Jefferson county, are bounded by the river. From Fort Niagara to the mouth of the Genesee River, in Munroe county, a distance of about 85 miles, the coast presents an almost undeviating level under the primeval brush-wood, relieved by a few scattered clearances. Should the tourist, on ascending the Genesee to Carthage, which is the port of Rochester, resolve upon visiting this city, he will find enough to engage and gratify his curiosity till he resumes his journey by the next 6teamer. This large commercial and manufacturing town owes its greatness mainly to the \" water privileges\" which the proprietors on the banks of the Genesee here possess. For a considerable way above the Upper Falls, the banks are on both sides surmounted by a great variety of mills. Its proximity to Lake Ontario, and the passage of the Erie Canal through its principal streets, contribute ma terially to its prosperity. Oswego, the principal commercial port on the American side of the lake, is pleasantly situated at the mouth of the river of that name. The principal part of the town is on the western bank, and has a neat and stirring appearance. On the opposite bank are some large mills, and here terminates the Oswego Canal from Syracuse, distant about 38 miles, and the railway from the same place. About half-way betwixt Carthage and Oswego is Great Sodus Bay. At the eastern extremity of the lake, on the south side of Black River Bay, lies, in a very sheltered situation, Sacket's Harbour. This was the naval station of the United States on the lake during the last war with Great Britain. After reaching Cape St. Vincent and proceeding onwards, for about 20 miles, the steamer reaches French Creek, after which the vessel will stop at Clayton, and Alexandria, from which points excellent views of the \" Thousand Islands\" will be obtained. (See Lake of the Thousand Islands.) TRENTON FALLS, STATE OF NEW YORK. The tourist proceeding from New York, by the New York Central Railroad from Albany on his way to Niagara, will find himself well paid by a visit to the Falls of Trenton, which are situated on the Utica and Black Biver Railroad, and 15 miles N. by E. of the Town of Utica, in the County of Oneida. Trenton Falls consist of a series of 6 falls within the distance of two miles, with an aggregate fall of 312 feet, and present a sight more re markable for the wild and romantic situation in which they are, than for their great vol ume of water. The name of the stream on which these falls are, is known as West Canada Creek, which flows through a densely-wooded country \u2014 particularly near the falls \u2014 of which no sign is to be seen till the tourist comes upon them at the edge of the gorge where they are situat ed, and down which the water rushes with great violence, as it comes from the falls, only to be lost to sight in the dark recesses of the wooded ravine. In one place, the height of the embankment is 140 feet perpendicular. At the upper falls the descent is 20 feet, from which the water rushes on to the second falls, called the Cascades. (See engraving.) The third fall is named the Mill-dam, and, a little below, are the High Falls, which has a perpendicular fall of 109 feet (See engraving.) Sherman's Falls \u2014 named so after Rev.

These fishes are from 3 to 6 inches in length. \" The waters of the cave are of the purest kind ; and, besides the springs and streams of fresh water, there are one or two sulphur springs. There are streams, lakes, and wa terfalls of sufficient width and depth to com pare with the world above ground. Some of these rivers, as they are called, are navi gated by boats of sufficient size to carry 12 persons; and one of them, called the Echo, is said to be broad and deep enough, at all times, to float the largest steamers. The rivers of the Mammoth Cave were never crossed till 1840. Some of them flow in deep channels, the sides of which rise high above their ordinary level. After heavy rains, they are sometimes swollen so as to rise more than 50 feet. At such times the streams, and especially the cataracts, of the cave, exhibit a most terrific appearance. Great exertions have been made to discover the sources of these streams, and where they find their outlets : yet they still remain, in this respect, as much a mystery as ever. \" It would be impossible, within the limits of this article, to describe in detail the many objects of curiosity and scenes of grandeur which are to be found in the apparently in terminable recesses of the Mammoth Cave.

It is only within a few years that this cave has been very extensively explored ; and it is still supposed that but a small part of it, in comparison with the whole, has ever been trodden by the foot of man. It has been es timated that the length of all the different avenues and branches, when added together, would make more than 600 miles. As far as known, there are in the cave 246 avenues, 47 domes, 8 cataracts, and 23 pits. The darkness, deeper than that of the blackest midnight, which pervades these subterrane an recesses, and which is little more than rendered visible by the torches which the visitors carry with them, renders it difficult for the spectator to form any thing like an adequate idea of its vast dimensions, its great heights and depths in the different apartments, and of the singularity and beau ty of the natural decorations they contain. \" It is a curious fact that fish without eyes have been caught in the rivers of this cave.

Its shore contains the re mains of several old forts, memorable in the French and Revolutionary wars. This beau tiful mountain lake of New York is 36 miles in length, varying in breadth from f to 4 miles. The water is remarkably transparent, and in some places is more than 400 feet deep. Scarcely any thing can be imagined more beautiful or picturesque than the scenery along its banks. The romantic effect of the prospect is creatly enhanced by the multitude of islands of various forms and sizes, which meet the gaze on every side. A popular notion prevails that their number corresponds with that of the days of the year. Twelve miles from the south-west ex- tremity of the lake there is an island of about 200 acres, called, from its position, Twelve Mile Island. A mile further north there is a high point, or tongue of land, called Tongue Mountain, west of which projects a small arm of the lake called North-west Bay. Here the narrowest part of the lake com mences, and continues 7 or 8 miles. Near the west end of the Narrows, on the eastern side of the lake, is Black Mountain, the sum mit of which is the highest point in the im mediate vicinity of the lake, having an ele vation of 2,200 feet above its surface. About 12 miles beyond Black Mountain there is a rock about 200 feet high, rising almost per pendicularly from the surface of the water. During the'French war, Major Rogers, being closely pursued by the Indians, slid down this deep declivity, and safely landed on the ice, leaving his pursuers petrified with aston ishment at the daring exploit they had wit nessed. From this circumstance the rock has been named Rogers' Slide.

The first pitch is nigh 200 feet, and the water looks like flakes of snow before it touches the bottom, and then gathers itself together again for a new start ; and maybe flutters over 50 feet of flat rock before it falls for another 100 feet, when it jumps from shelf to shelf, first running this way and that way, striving to get out of the hollow, till it finally gets to the plain.\" VIEW DOWN SLEEPY HOLLOW\u2014 CATSKILL MOUNTAINS.

I, NEW HAMPSHIRE. The accomplished author of \" America and the Americans\" thus writes regarding this portion of the United States: \u2014 \"This is one of the wildest regions in the United States. From the top of the stage we have a wide prospect over forests, pastoral valleys, ravines, and dingles; Mount Lafayette rising before us in solemn majesty, and behind us, far as the eye can reach, an undulating country, stretching away towards the frontiers of Canada. For the first 3 miles the drive lies through a tangled wood, and up an ascent so steep that our team occasionally pauses. The road is so narrow that the trees touch the carriage on both sides at the same time, and so rough that passengers hold on firmly for their lives ; yet the coachman drives his six in hand with the utmost ease and skill.\" this, he must pass through a forest, and cross several ravines. These are neither wide nor deep, nor are they discovered at a great dis tance ; for the trees fill them up exactly even with the mountain on each side, and their branches interlock with each other in such a manner that it is very difficult to pass through them, and they are 60 stiff and thick as almost to support a man's weight After crossing Mount Franklin, you pass over the eastern pinnacle of Mount Monroe, and soon find yourself on a plain of some extent, at the foot of Mount Washington. Here is a fine resting-place, on the margin of a beau tiful sheet of water, of an oval form, cover ing about three-fourths of an acre. The waters are pleasant to the taste, and deep. Not a living creature is to be seen in the waters at this height on the hill. ; nor does vegetation grow in or around them, to ob scure the clear rocky or gravelly bottom on which they rest. A small spring discharges itself into this pond, at its south-east angle. Another pond, of about two-thirds its size, lies north-west of this. Directlv before you, the pinnacle of Mount Washington rises with majestic grandeur, like an immense pyramid, or some vast kremlin, in this mag nificent city of mountains. The pinnacle is elevated about 1500 feet above the plain, and is composed principally of huge rocks of granite and gneiss, piled together, pre senting a variety of colours and fo'.ms. The ascent is made on horseback. During nine or ten months of the year, the summits of the mountains are covered with snow and ice, giving them a bright and dazzling appearance. On every side are long and winding gullies, deepening in their descent to the plain below. These mountains are situated in the county of Coos, in the N. part of the State. They extend about 20 miles, from S. W. to N. E., and are the more elevated parts of a range extending many miles in that direction. Their base is about 10 miles broad, and are the highest in New England ; and, if we ex- cept the Rocky Mountains, and one or two peaks in North Carolina, they are the most lofty of any in the United States. Although these mountains are 65 miles dis- tant from the ocean, their snow-white sum- mits are distinctly visible, in good weather, more than 50 miles from shore. Their ap- pearance, r.t that distance, is that of a sil- very cloud skirting the horizon. The names here given are those generally appropriated to the different summits : J/-.j.;j/ Washington is known by its superior eleva- tion, and by its being the southern of the three highest peaks. Mount Adams is known by its sharp, terminating peak, and being the north of Washington. Jefferson is situ- ated between these two. Madison is the eastern peak of the range. Monroe is the first to the south of Washington. Franklin is the second south, and is known by its level surface. Lafayette is known by its conical shape, and being the third south of Wash- ington. The ascent to the summits of these mountains, though fatiguing, is not danger- ous ; and the visitant is richly rewarded for his labour and curiosity. In passing from the Notch to the highest summit, the travel ler crosses the summits of Mounts Lafayette, Franklin, aud Monroe. In accomplishing In ascending, you must pass enormous masses of loose stone : but a ride of half an hour will generally carry you to the summit. The view from this point is wonderfully grand and picturesque. Innumerable moun tains, hikes, ponds, rivers, towns, and vil lages meet the delighted eye, and the dim Atlantic stretches its waters along the east ern horizon. To the north is seen the lofty summits of Adams and Jefferson ; and to the east, a little detached from the range, sup ported on the north by a high ridge, which extends to Mount Jefferson ; on the north east by a large grassy plain, terminating in a vast spur, extending far away in that di rection ; east, by a promontory, which breaks off abruptly at St. Anthony's Nose ; south and south-east by a grassy plain, in summer, of more than 40 acres. At the south-eastern extremity of this plain a ridge commences, which slopes gracefully away towards the vale of the Saco, upon which, at short dis tances from each other, arise rocks, resem bling in some places, towers ; in others, rep resenting the various orders of architec ture."], [180, "58 WILLEY HOUSE, WHITE MOUNTAINS.

The above house stands upon a spot which will ever remain memorable in the history of the White Mountains, as having been the scene of a fearful calamity which overtook a family named Willey, residing there, who were all buried beneath an avalanche, or slide, from the mountain, which occurred during the year 1826, a year remarkable for a great flood in these mountain regions. Leaving Willey House, the tourist, who is desirous of ascending higher, will find him self in the vicinity of the \"Notch,\" as it is called. \" The Notch of the White Mountains is a phrase appropriated to a very narrow defile, extending two miles in length, between two huge cliffs, apparently rent asunder by some vast convulsion of nature, probably that of the deluge. \" The scenery at this place is exceedingly beautiful and grand.

The Hudson forms one of the great leading routes for all classes of travellers bound for the north or north-west, alike either for the tourist in search of pleasure, the invalid for health, and the emigrant from the old world in quest of a home in the new. Up the Hudson the great stream of travellers go; so that, for general in formation, we purpose noticing the chief features of this magnificent trip, which, if made by a day boat from either New York or Albany, cannot fail to astonish and de light the traveller. The trip is enjoyed, also, by many by night, starting from either terminus about 6, p. m. The time occupied on the journey is from 8 to 10 hours. Emigrants generally leave New York by the night boat, which starts about 6, p. m., arriving in Albany in time sor the trains via the New York Central, and other railroads for the north and north-west, which run in connection. For size, comfortable accommodation, and internal magnificence, we believe the New York and Albany steamers to be unequalled by any river boats in the world. Tourists can have their baggage checked on board the Albany steamers in the same manner as on the railroads, on application to the baggage-master on board.

As an illustration of the interior of a river steamboat, we give the prefixed engraving of an interior view of the state-room of the \" Isaac Newton,\" one of the night boats which runs be tween New York and Albany. Destined for a trip up the Hudson, we shall briefly notice a few of the chief points on the route, although no description, whatever, can convey to the reader a just idea of this trip \u2014 which should be made by all tourists \u2014 if at all possible \u2014 as the scenery of the Hudson, for river scenery, is not equalled by that of any other river on the American Continent, which we are acquainted with. Further on is the village of Nyack \u2014 whilst di rectly opposite is Tarrttown, a place replete with many at tractions of a pictorial and historical character, and where some beautiful residences have been erected by New York merchants. In the neigh bourhood is Sleepy Hollow, one of the most beautiful dells in the whole route. Passing on ward, we reach the wharf for Started from the wharf at New York, the first place we pass is Hoboken, one of the lungs of New York, to which great numbers resort every Sunday to eojoy a drink of water from tlie Sybil's Springs there, and a walk through the pleasant Elysian Fields, or from there to Weehawken, or Bergen Sing Sing, 33 miles from the city, at one of the broadest points on the river. At, Sing Sing is the celebrated State Prison, an object of great interest for visiting, with cells for upwards of 1000 prisoners. Almost 2 miles from Sing Sing, the Croton River rises, from which water is conveyed to New York. Opposite to Sing Sing is Yerdriteges' Hook, a high headland, be hind which, on the same height, 250 feet above the river, is Heights. Passing on, the next prominent point reach ed, is Fort Lee, which is the commencement of the far-famed Palisades. These bold precip itous rocks resemble, in some respects, the ap pearance of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. The height of the Palisades ranges from 20 to 600 feet, and being fringed with brushwood on the top, and at their base, with some neat little cottages at the water's edge, form a very fine appearance as the steamer skims past them. On the opposite side, will next be seen Rockland Lake, from which the denizens of New York receive their chief supply of ice \u2014 an engraving of which will be found in another portion of this work. The lake is about 4 miles in circumference. Proceeding onward, we come to Manhattanvilie, situated on the island on which the City of New York stands, and prettily embosomed amidst woods and hills. On a height above the town is Clermont, once the residence of Joseph Bonaparte, and other celeb rities. Manhattanvilie is also the resting place of Audubon, the great naturalist. Haverstraw Village, on the same side of the river, 36 miles from New York. Here are the old forts Clinton and Montgomery \u2014 cele brated in Revolutionary history. On the opposite, or east side of the river, is Yerplanck's Point, celebrated as being the spot at which Henry Hudson anchored the ship \" Half Moon\" on his first voyage up the Hud son. The surprise of the Indians in those days may be imagined at seeing, for the first time, a vessel of such proportions opposite their homes. One writer records the following incident, which followed that event : \u2014 Fort Washington \u2014 celebrated in the Ameri can Revolutionary annals \u2014 is now in sight. To capture this fort, the British lost 1200 men, be sides having the ship \" Mercury\" so riddled with shot, that she sunk. Spuyten Duyvel Creek is about 2 miles further on \u2014 passing which is Yonkers, a thriving town on the east bank of the river \u2014 17 miles from New York \u2014 in the vicinity of which are several neat villas, and fine panoramic scenery. Amongst other resi dences may be seen Fonthill, once the residence of Edwin Forrest, the celebrated tragedian. \" Filled with wonder, they came flocking to the ship in boats, but their curiosity ended in a tragedy. One of them, overcome by acquisi tiveness, crawled up the rudder, entered the cabin window, and stole a pillow and a few arti cles of wearing apparel. The mate saw the thief pulling his bark for land, and shot at and killed him. The ship's boat was sent for the stolen articles, and when one of the natives, who had leaped into the water, caught hold of the side of the shallop, his hand was cut off by a sword, and he was drowned. This was the first blood shed by these voyagers. Intelligence Hastings, about 3 miles from Yonkers, is next reached, and 2 miles further on that of Dobbs' Ferry, on the same side ot the river.

Shortly after leaving which, we reach the important town of Highlands of tbe Hudson commence. On the east shore is the pretty little town of Peek skill, fronting Dunderberg, or Thunder Moun tain. At the foot of which lies Caldwell's Landing. As the steamer proceeds up the river, the tourist accustomed to sail up Loch Lomond (Scotland) will be forcibly struck with the similarity in appearance which the Hudson here presents to it, as the steamer proceeds on wards. At one time, you will be sailing past islands possessed of all the beauty of Ellen's Isle on Loch Katrine (Scot.,) with high hills wooded to their tops on each side, whilst pro ceeding onwards the channel of the river ap pears completely blocked up, till the steamer, in approaching, takes a turn round the base of one of the hills, only to open up another scene of great magnificence, aud reveal the Highland beauty of hill and dale, clothed in their brightest summer foliage. The Highlands \u2014 as they are well named \u2014 extend over an area of about 25 miles, along the course of the Hud son, and during the whole trip, no portion will be better enjoyed till the steamer reaches about the last height near Newburg. Newburg \u2014 with its 12,000 population \u2014 nice ly situated on the face of the hill. To the south of the town is the spot which once form ed the head-quarters of Washington, during the stay of his army at New Windsor, not far off. Opposite, on the other side of the river, is Break-Neck Mountain, which was supposed to have a resemblance to a Turk's Face, and can be easily seen from the deck of the steamer when approaching Pallopel's Island. \" The story goes, that some Irishmen were quarrying for granite once, when one of them put a blast of powder before the Turk's face, saying he thought the old fellow would like to have his nose blowed. And the nose was com pletely blown away ; while the admirers of the curious and beautiful think that tbe Irishman, who was shortly after killed, was hurried from the world for his barbarity to the works of Na ture.\" (See engraving.) Opposite to this spot is On rounding Dunderberg Mountain, will be seen Fishkill, the scene of many of the incidents related in Cooper's novel of \" The Spy.\" Pro ceeding on, we reach New Hamburg, Mar borough, Barnegat ; and, passing which, the pretty and retired town of Anthony's Nose, 1128 feet high. Two miles further on, Sugar Loaf, 806 feet high \u2014 whilst on the west side of the river Buttermilk Falls will be seen descending over the face of the hill.

Poughkeepsie \u2014 73 miles from New York \u2014 is reached, and one of the largest towns between New York and Albany. It has a population of upwards of 15,000, and is the centre of a rich agricultural district, which sends large supplies of farm and dairy produce to New York. Founded by the Dutch 150 years ago. Oppo site Poughkeepsie is New Paltz Lauding. West Point forms one of the stopping-places for the steamer. Here is situated the United States Military Academy, where cadets are edu cated. It is beautifully situated, and visited by many tourists. Hyde Park and Placentta are 6 miles be yond, situated on the east side of the river. Placentia is the residence of the veteran author, J. K. Paulding, and from which is seen some of the finest views of the river and country round about, as far up as the Catskill Moun tains. Passing Staatsburg, we shortly reach the wharf for Rondout and Kingston. (See engraving on page 69.) Kingston is a town of considerable importance, with a population of 13,000, and, probably, the most important town on the route. It was founded in 1663 by the Dutch, and burned by the British in 1773. There the first Constitution of New York was framed. Vanderlyn, the eminent painter, was born in Kingston, where he also died in 1853. As From there we proceed on to Cronest, 1428 feet high, of which the poet, G. P.

A writer on this scene says : \u2014 \" In it we have the constituents of many pictures which reproduce our characteristic land-features, viz. : repose, grace, richness of foliage, softness of sky, gentle flow of water \u2014 all harmonizing to produce a very inspiriting sensation in the mind.\""], [192, "70 THE NIAGAI 4. SUSPEN, \u0153 BRIDGE, NIAGARA SUSPENSION BRIDGE. The above sketch represents the great International Bridge, which spans the Niagara, and joins the United States with Canada. Its length, from tower to tower, is 821 feet 4 inches. Erected at a cost of about $400,000 (\u00a380,000 stg.). The lower floor or road-way is used for foot passengers, carriages, carts, etc., same as any ordinary road. The upper floor is for railroad traffic exclusively. Across this bridge, the trains of the Great Western Railroad of Canada and the various railroads of New York State, travel, each train drawn very slowly, by a light pilot engine. From a report, by Mr. Roebling, Engineer, on this gigantic structure, we copy the fol lowing particulars: \u2014 \"The base and towers on the New York side, contain 1350 cubic yards, which weigh about 3,000 tons. Add to this weight of the superstructure of 1,000 tons, and we have a total of 4,000 tons, in a compact and solid mass. \" There are 4 cables of 10 inches diameter, each composed of 3640 wires of small No. 9"], [193, "71 NIAGARA SUSPENSION BRIDGE. gauge, 60 wires forming one square inch of solid section ; making the solid section of each cable 60.40 square inches, wrapping not included. \" Each of the four large cables is composed of seven smaller ones, which I call strands. Each strand contains 520 wires. One of these forms the centre, the six others are placed around it\u2014 the 520 wires forming one strand of endless wire, obtained by splicing a num ber of single wires. The ends of the strands are passed around and confined in cast-irou shoes, which also receive the wrought-iron pin that forms a connection with the anchor chains. \" The wire measures 18.31 feet per pound, and the strength, therefore, is equivalent to 1640 lbs. per single wire, or nearly 100,000 pounds per square inch. \" Assuming the above average strength, the aggregate strength of the 14,560 wires com posing the four cables, will be 23,878,400 pounds. But their actual strength is greater, because the above calculations are based upon a minimum strength of the individual wires. We may assume their aggregate ultimate strength at 12,000 tons, of 2,000 pounds each. \" Both end3 of the bridge rest upon the cliffs, and are anchored to the rock. As far as supported by the cables, I estimate its weight at less thau 1000 tons, which includes the weight of cables between the towers, and the pressure of the river stays below. \" There are 624 suspenders, each capable of sustaining thirty tons, which makes their united strength 18,720 tons. The ordinary weight they have to support is only 1000 tons. A locomotive of thirty-four tons weight, including tender, spreads its weight, by means of the girders and trusses, over a length of no less than 200 feet. Of course the greatest pressure is under the engine, and is there supported by no less than twenty suspenders. If, by any accident, a sudden blow or jar should be produced, the streDgth of the suspenders will be abundant to meet it. \" A change of temperature of 100\u00b0 causes a difference in the level of the floor of two feet three inches. The lower floor, or river stays have enough of slack, or deflection, to adjust themselves under these changes. The only difference will be, that they are tighter in winter than in summer ; consequently, that the equilibrium of the bridge will be less affected by passing trains in cold weather than in warm. \" Droves of cattle are, according to the regulations, to be divided off into troops of 20, no more than three such bodies, or 60 in all, to be allowed on the bridge at one time. Each troop is to be led by one person, who is to check their progress in case they should start off on a trot. \" In my opinion, a heavy train, running at a speed of 20 miles an hour, does less injury to the structure, than is caused by 20 heavy cattle under a full trot. Public processions, marching to the sound of music, or bodies of soldiers keeping regular step, will produce a still more injurious effect.\" The charge for passing over the bridge, on foot, is 25 cents\u2014 going and returning. Car riage $1.00, with 25 cents for each passenger inside. The promenade, during a hot day, on the foot-path of the bridge, is deliciously cool, from the breeze which generally blows up or down the gorge of the river. The views looking towards the Falls, from different points on the bridge, are also exceedingly good, presenting to the stranger the picture of Niagara Falls, as they are represented in many engravings which are given of them, anel even the best of them, after all, only can give a very faint idea of the great reality."], [194, "72 SUSPENSION BRIDGE, FALLS OF NIAGARA.

They have been clad with a brilliant halo of imagination since we first heard of their existence, at school. The pen, the pencil, and photography, have all been laid under contribu tion, for the purpose of describing and illustrat ing the mighty cataract. The powers of word painting have been wielded by the literateur, the preacher, and the poet, to furnish suitable representations of the \" world's wonder.\" Fu tility and failure have been written upon every attempt. Tbe thunder of waters is inexpressi ble by human language ; but yet, to be admired it needs only to be seen ; and the deep impres sion that is stamped upon the mind of every spectator that stands before the stupend, us scene of Niagara, will never be erased from the tablets of memory. Who shall ever forget that moment when he leapt from the cars, bounded, with all the impatience of a curiosity cherished from earliest infancy, down the declivity, and the sublime scene burst upon his astonished vision ?

But instead of straining the capabilities of language, by heaping metaphor on metaphor, in a listless endeavour to describe the inde scribable, let us act as cicerone to the tourist, and leave him to drink inspiration from the voice of the living waters themselves.

After regaining the top of these stairs you may be disposed to rest. Plenty of seats are to be found close at hand, where you may rest and admire the scene around and in front of you.

Terrapin Bridge, and Prospect Tower.\u2014 Arrived at the edge of the river, as it sweeps rapidly past, you proceed along the wooden bridge, which extends to the base of the Tower.

The American Fall is about 900 feet wide, with a descent, in one unbroken sheet, of 163 feet per pendicular. The Canadian or Horse-Shoe Fall is about 2000 feet wide, with a fall of 158 feet. The total descent of the water from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is 334 feet. Such is the great action of the water upon the precipice over which it falls \u2014as well as upon the embankments upon both sides of the river \u2014 it is estimated that about one foot is worn away annually, and that the falls have receded during the course of ages\u2014es timated by geologists at 37,000 years \u2014 from Queenstown, 7 miles below, to where they are at present.

The vast volume of water \u2014 the magnificent view down the river to Suspen sion Bridge \u2014 the rapids coming down the cata ract behind you \u2014 together with the scenery on every side \u2014 will all combine to entrance you to the spot with admiration and delight, and ren der you almost unwilling to leave a scene so grand and inspiring.

Supposing, then, that you are on the American side of the river, you proceed to Goat Island. In proceeding thither you cross the bridge of 3 arches, which spans the river, to Bath Island, from off which you get an excellent view of the Rapids, as they come rushing along, as if bent on sweeping away the bridge, and every thing on it, before them down the stream and over the fall. Arrived across the bridge, you enter a cottage, register your name, and pay a toll of 25 cents, (Is. stg.,) which will admit you to cross and re cross during the whole season. Passing en, you may observe, to your right hand, the paper works which were burned down last autumn. Passing them, you cross another small bridge, and then enter upon the beautiful grounds of Goat Island. Turning to the right hand, you proceed to the \" Hog's Back,\" and across a small bridge to \" Luna Island,\" which divides a small portion of the American Fall. An excel lent view is there obtained of the American Fall, and scenery up and down the river. Retracing your steps towards Goat Island, you next proceed to the Three Sisters \u2014 three islands which stand out in the river, and named, respectively, \" Moss Island,\" \" Deer Island,\" and \"Allan's Island.\" Between the first of the Three Sisters and Goat Island is the \" Hermit's Cas cade,'' named after a religious hermit, who be came so enamoured with the spot that he took up his abode and lived there for some time, in Robinson Crusoe fashion, till one day he was non est, it being supposed he had ventured too far upon a particular log of wood, which cap sized him into a watery grave. After leaving Luna Island, you proceed through Goat Island, keeping on the walk nearest the river, towards the Canadian Fall. Before reaching there, however, you descend Biddle's Stairs (named after Mr. Biddle, of Phi ladelphia, who built them) to the Cave of the Winds. The walk around Goat Island will be highly appreciated. Some charming nooks of great beauty are there, whilst from the head of the Island is to be seen, 21- miles up the river, Chippewa; and, four miles from there, Navy Island, belonging to Canada, which was occu pied by the Canadian patriots of 1837-8. From there, also, the steamer Caroline which was Cave of the Winds. \u2014 Reaching the bottom of Biddle's Stairs you proceed by a narrow foot path towards the American Fall, behind which"], [197, "*aais vavNvo hohj -aais nvoiieihv kosji Tiva aoHS-asaoH 'aooa aaavx Trva aoHS-asaoH 'aaA\\.ox Niavaaax"], [198, "76 NIAGARA FALLS. conveying provisions and ammunition to the rebels, was cut adrift and sent afloat down the river, and over the Horse-Shoe Fall. Near the head of the Island the point may be seen where \u2014before any bridges connected the Island with the mainland \u2014 Stedman, the occupier of the Island, crossed with bis goats for pasture, hence the name Goat Island. board another lot of passengers. Fare for the trip 50 cents, (2s. stg.). In the ferry-house a beautifully clear stream of water, from the rock, is kept running con tinually, with tumblers provided for the use of visitors. The Messrs. Porters, to whom the property belongs, have done much lately to improve the appearance of the place all around, and added greatly to the comfort and convenience of visit ors, by providing seats, etc., etc. Fort Schlosser may be seen further up the river, also on the American side, where La Salle, the great explorer, first founded a trading post. This fort has changed hands, first from the French to the British, and next from the British to the Americans. About this spot the vessel, (named the Griffin,) which first navigated the river and lakes, was built. A Father Haunepin is said to have been the first white man who visited Niagara and saw the Falls, and who, like many who have succeeded him, published a very exaggerated account of them. Having spent some time at Point View, you may uow proceed down the incline we have mentioned, cross the river in a small boat, aud land on the Canadian side, near the Clifton House, on your road to a curiosity in its way \u2014 the Burning Springs \u2014 shown to strangers by an old native of Aberdeenshire, (Scotland). Before reaching there, however, you will pass Table Rock \u2014 a view from off which will interest you. In wandering round Goat Island you have now reached the starting-point on it, viz., the Bridge at the Rapids, which you re-cross, and make direct for Point View. Table Rock, of which we give an illustration, is situated on the Canada side of the river, near the angle where the Horse-Shoe Fall pours over. It is a crag, which projects over the edge of the precipice, and is about 160 feet above the river. It is now much smaller than in former years, large portions having fallen away from it at dif ferent times. Near Table Rock there is another staircase, which you may descend and get a view from behind the great sheet of water which falls over the Horse Shoe, from off a narrow ledge of rock, called Termination Rock,* which, together with the ground all about it, shakes with the immense power of the water pouring down upo\u00bb it. It is only, however, when the water is not very full, that this sight can be seen. Point View is situated close to the edge of the American Fall, and on the very brink of the precipice. From this point you get an excellent view of both Falls, but more partic ularly a distant view of the Horse-Shoe Fall. In the ferry-house at Point View there is a railway, down an incline of 1 in 31 feet. The cars are worked up and down by water power, and are completely under the control of those in charge. The fare for going up or down is 5 cents. At the bottom of the incline is the river, where boats may be hired to take you across to the Canada side of the river for 20 cents. Alongside of the railway incline, there are steps, up and down which parties may go free. The depth, to the edge of the water, is 260 feet \u2014 2.1 steps in all. A favourite time with many for visiting the falls is at suuset, about which time some most beautiful phenomena are to be seen. Again, the view by moonlight is considered to be very fine, and presenting totally different features from any thing to be seen during the day. In winter time also, we understand, the Falls, together with the scenery around them, present sights well worth being seen by every tourist. In the summer season a small steamer, called the \" New Maid of the Mist,\" sails from the foot of the ferry stairs, up as near as possible to the base of the Horse-Shoe Fall. On proceeding on board you put on an oil-skin cloak and hood, which envelopes the whole person, excepting the face; and, thus clad, you stand on deck, viewing the Falls, as the steamer makes her speedy trip, and as she rocks about amid the agitated water. Certainly the view is excellent, unless when the sun is shining out very strong, then much of the sight is lost, owing to that and the spray from the Falls falling so thickly upon the face and eyes. The sail is one only of a few minutes, nevertheless we recommend all to take a trip on board the little craft. Great vigilance and care is necessary in steering round the base of the Fall. When it has reached the middle of the Fall the steam is shut off, and then the boat is swung round and carried down by the current, when steam is put on, and she is turned round to the landing-point, ready to take on To reach Burning Springs it is a considerable walk round from the Clifton House, so that most parties engage a conveyance thither. The pedestrian, however, will enjoy the walk very much. The charge at the Burning Springs is 25 cents each.

Sometimes it burns much brighter than at other times, the water emitting a strong smell, similar to that of some mineral springs. When at Burning Springs, another and different view from any hitherto seen, is presented of the River Niagara, as it comes down from Lake Erie, and, in sum mer, the scenery in the neighbourhood of the Springs is beautiful in the extreme. learn that the American, who preceded or fol lowed you on your visit, was parted cor.panj with on the same terms, and with an equally flattering account of how the Americans licked the British, aDd, of course, also won the battle! On the way to Lundy's Lane, you may pass through the pretty little village of Drummond ville, named after General Drummond, com mander of the British forces at the battle refer red to. From Lundy's Lane you may now proceed on to the Suspension Bridge and the Whirlpool. Particulars respecting the Suspen sion Bridge will be found annexed, with illus trations of it. The Whirlpool can be seen from the Canada side of the river. When at the Suspension Bridge you proceed along the top of the em bankment, through fields and brushwood, fol lowing the course of the river, till its course turns at a right angle on towards Lake Ontario. It is at this angle of the river where the whirl pool is. An excellent view of the river and scenery along its banks, and around the whirl pool, is to be had from the Canada side imme diately above it, and the beauty of the scene there may tempt you to prolong your rest on the wooden seat erected there for the wearied trav eller. Leaving the Burning Springs, you may now proceed to the battle-ground of Lundy's Lane. There a wooden tower is erected, for the benefit of those who wish to ascend and obtain a mag nificent view of the country. On the top of this tower one of the heroes of the Battle of Lundy's Lane will be met with, in the shape of an at tendant, who will be glad to point out to you all the points of interest connected with the fight ing between the Americans and the British, on those very fields you will there survey. If you happen to be a British visitor, the faithful at tendant will not wound any national prejudices you may have regarding who was most success ful on particular occasions during the struggle, but rather flatter them by leading you to under stand that, of course, the British came off vic torious. You will, however, perhaps, be in some doubt, after all, as to that, if you take the ipse dixit of this military chronicler, when you The visitor who expects to see an immense whirlpool will, we think, be disappointed, as the Whirlpool, so called, consists of a series of eddies in the rapid stream as it reaches the end of the gorge at the angle of the river \u2014 more remarka ble for being raised up in the centre of the"], [200, "78 NIAGARA FALLS AND ROUTES.

The best view, however, of tbe Whirlpool is to be had at the edge of the river, on the American side, exactly opposite to the point mentioned above. To reach there, you proceed across the Suspension Bridge, turn to your left, and walk along the public road till you reach Devaux's College \u2014 which you canuot but observe as you go along. There you turn from off the pub lic road, and follow a narrow road through a dense wood, until you reach a small wooden house, where you will hud parties ready to give you all information respecting the path down to the edge of the river below. You there pay 25 cents, which goes to the support of Devaux's College \u2014 a college established, at a cost of $154,000, by a Frenchman named Devaux, for the free maintenance and education of 100 boys. You will, in all probability, be pleased with your visit to the Whirlpool. Whilst there, you may proceed to the Devil's Hole, a short way down the river, on the same side, and which consists of a chasm of about 200 feet deep on the bauk of the river. The small stream which pours over the precipice above there, is called Bloody Run \u2014 named so in consequence of the colour given to it on one occasion by the blood of the British troops mixing with it, during an en gagement with some Indians and French dur ing the war there in 1763. Niagara Falls. \u2014 In addition to the name of the celebrated Falls, the town in the immediate vicinity takes also the uame of Niagara Falls \u2014 situated in the State of New York. As is well known, it is the fashionable resort of all who desire to make their residence on the American side of the river. The hotels are on the largest scale, and characterized by great magnificence and comfort. Trains arrive at and depart from the station at the town, to and from which omnibuses run in connection with the principal hotels. The town on the American side, at Suspen sion Bridge, is known by the name of Niagara City. Travellers for the Falls should check their baggage to \"Niagara Falls,\" if they intend resid ing on the American side ; and to \" Suspension Bridge, Clifton,\" if on the Canadian side \u2014 ou which side there are excellent hotels also. The large illustration of the Falls given in the accompanying page, was taken from what is considered the best point for seeing both the American and Canadian (or Horse-Shoe) Falls together, viz., near the Clifton House, on the Canadian side of the river. This view was taken by photograph, by M. Hanungel, Photo grapher, Broadway, New York, last summer, and is decidedly the best and most correct view of the Falls we ever saw ou paper. To pre serve, as far as possible, in the process of en graving, all the details of the great original, we have had M. Hanungel's immense photograph re-photographed on a reduced scale on wood, by Price's patent process, and engraved, so that we can, with confidence, refer to the accompany ing view of the Niagara Falls as correct in every particular. Brock's Monument forms one of the \"lions\" of Niagara, which tourists, in approaching from Toronto, per steamer and rail, will observe to great advantage, as they proceed in the cars from the town of Niagara to Suspension Bridge. It stands on Queenstown Heights (Canada side). Erected to the British general, Sir Isaac Brock, who fell in the engagement fought there in 1812. On the top stands the statue of the gallant officer. Although a considerable distance from the Falls, (about 7 miles,) yet if the tourist has time, the visit to it will repay the time and trouble, as a most magnificent view of the river, country round about, and Lake Ontario is there obtained. The other illustrations presented have also been engraved from photographs takeu there last summer. ROUTES TO THE FALLS.

This beautiful route may be traversed either by rail from Montreal to Prescott Junction, and thence by rail to Ottawa, as described elsewhere ; or it may be taken by way of rail to Lachine, steamer from Lachine to Carrillon, rail from Carrillon to Grenville, and Gren ville to Ottawa by steamer again. By this route it will be seen that there are several changes to be made, which cannot be avoided, on account of the rapids on the river, which cannot be \" run\" by the steamer. This route is one so little known, that, notwithstanding the disadvantages which chang ing so often presents, we have thought it advisable to give a brief account of the trip to Ottawa, as made by us last June, addressing ourselves as if the reader were going. Pro ceeding in cab or omnibus to Griffintown \u2014 1\u00a3 miles from post-office, Montreal \u2014 you arrive and book at the Lachine Railroad Depot ; fare through to Ottawa, first class, $3 ; second class, $2. Strange to say, no baggage is \" checked through,\" on this route as via Grand Trunk railroad, or the other lines in the United States. Started on the cars, therefore, with a string of tickets to and from the different points on your way, you soon reach Lachine, nine miles off. At Lachine you change cars, and step on board the steamer \" Lady Simpson\" in waiting, and once under weigh, yon get a fine view of the mighty St. Lawrence, with Lake St. Louis close at hand. Not long after the steamer starts, breakfast will be announced, which may be partaken of, if you had not got it before you started from Montreal. An excellent breakfast for Is. 10}<\u00a3 currency, (Is. 6d. stg.,) or 37-J cents. If a fine morning, you will be delighted with the sail, as the steamer skims along the shore of the Island of Montreal, till she reaches St. Anne's, at the extreme corner of that island. At St. Anne's, the steamer leaves the St. Lawrence, and passes through the locks there, and is then on the bosom of the Ot tawa. You will scarcely be able to imagine it to be a river ; in reality, it forms the Lake of the Two Mountains, being one of the numerous lakes which the Ottawa may be said to be a succession of. At St. Anne's you will get an excellent view of the substantial stone bridge of the Grand Trunk Railway, which here crosses the Ottawa, and which forms a striking contrast to the mistaken policy of the railway companies in the United States in building so many \" rickety\" wooden bridges \u2014 with their warnings up of fines of so much if you trot a horse over them \u2014 and which in going over so many accidents have occurred. Here, possibly, you may observe, against one of the piers of this bridge, a portion of a large raft, which, in \" running\" the rapids last season, became unmanageable and dashed up against the bridge scattering the raft in all directions\u2014 to the great loss of the proprietor of it. Some of the logs may be seen yet, resting up against the pier of the bridge, as if trying to clear all before them, and the gigantic pier standing up, in its mighty strength, as if bidding them float quietly past. St. Anne's is the spot where the poet Moore located the scene of his celebrated Canadian Boat Song. CANADIAN BOAT SONG. BT THOMAS MOORE. Faintly as tolls the evening chime, Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time ; Soon as the woods on shore look dim, We'll sing at St. Anne's our parting hymn.

There is not a breath the blue wave to curl ; But when the wind blows off the shore, Oh ! sweetly we'll rest our weary oar. Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, The Rapids are near, and the daylight's past."], [202, "80 TRIP UP THE OTTAWA. Ottawa's tide ! this trembling moon Shall see us float over thy surges soon. Saint of this green Isle 1 hear our prayers, Oh ! grant us cool heavens and favoring airs. Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, The Rapids are near, and the daylight's past. Started from St, Anne's you shortly reach a beautiful expansion of the Ottawa \u2014 which forms here what is called The Lake of the Two Mountains \u2014 named from the two moun tains which are seen to the north, rising four hundred to five hundred feet high. After sailing a short time, and with your face to the bow of the steamer, you will ob serve, to the right, where this great river\u2014 coming slowly and silently along \u2014 is divided by the Island of Montreal ; the one fork of the river which you observe to the north-east, wind ing its way past the island, after which it makes its acquaintance with the St. Lawrence, to the north-east of Montreal. The other fork, or division on which you have just started from, at St. Anne's, meets the St. Lawrence there ; although, strange to say, the waters of these two immense rivers \u2014 as if not relishing the mixture of each other, and thus forming one \u2014 continue their separate and undivided distinctness for miles, till they meet with such rough treatment, from either torrents, wind, or waves, that they join issue, and form at last, one immense river in the St. Lawrence, in which the beautiful but majestic Ottawa is swallowed up. In the last report on the Geological Survey of Canada, the following remarks on the com ponent parts, and other peculiarities, of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence occur : \u2014 \" The water of the Ottawa, containing but little more than one-third as much solid mat ter as the St. Lawrence, is impregnated with a much larger portion of organic matter, derived from the decomposition of vegetable remains, and a large amount of alkalies uncom bined with chlorine or sulphuric acid. Of the alkalies determined as chlorids, the chlorid of potassium in the Ottawa water forms thirty-two per cent., and in that of the St. Lawrence, only sixteen per cent.; while in the former, the silicia equals thirty-four per cent., and in the latter, twenty-three per cent., of the mineral matters. The Ottawa drains a region of crystalline rocks, and receives from these by far the greater part of its waters; hence the salts of potash, liberated by the decomposition of these rocks, are in large proportion. The extensive vegetable decomposition, evidenced by the organic matters dissolved in the water, will also have contributed a portion of potash. It will be recollected that the proportion of potash salts in the chlorids of sea-water and saline waters, generally, does not equal more than two or three per cent. As to the St. Lawrence, although the basin of Lake Superior, in which the river takes its origin, is surrounded by ancient sandstones, and by crystalline rocks, it afterwards flows through lakes whose basins are composed of pal\u00e6ozoic strata, which abound in limestones rich in gypsum and salt, and these rocks have given the Waters of this river that predominance of soda, chlorine, and sulphuric acid which distinguishes it from the Ottawa. It is an interesting geographical feature of these two rivers, that they each pass through a series of great lakes, in which the waters are enabled to deposit their suspended impurities, and thus are rendered remarkably clear and transparent.\" The two rivers thus not mixing at once, is owing, we presume, to the specific gravity of the one being much heavier than that of the other. The two are distinctly seen flowing down together, by the difference in their color. The lake you are now upon \u2014 if a fine morning, and in summer \u2014 will be as calm as a mill pond, and, with its wooded islands, and nicely-wooded country round about, forms a scene of the finest character. Each turn the steamer takes, it opens up with it new beauties. Sometimes, however, the lake, now so placid and beautiful to look upon, is raised like a raging sea, rendering its navigation not so easy, as many a poor raftsman has found to his cost, whilst navigating his treasure of lumber to Quebec or Lachine. You may, possibly, see some of these rafts of lumber as you pass along. Nowhere in the whole of America, we believe, will you see such magnificent and valuable rafts of lumber as on the Ottawa. The rafts on the Delaware, Ohio, and Mississippi, which we have 6een, are nothing to com-"], [203, "TRIP UP THE OTTAWA. 81 I pare to them\u2014 either in Bize or in the value of the wood of which they are composed. (See Lumber and Lumbermen. ) Passing onwards on the lake, you will observe The Inman Village, at the base of the Two Mountains. There reside the remnants of two tribes, the Iroquois and Algonquins, i On the sandy soil behind the village, the Indians have their game3, foot races, etc., etc. After passing there, the steamer will probably stop at Vaudrecl, at the head of the Lake of the Two Mountains. Proceeding on from there, the steamer will steer for Point Anglais, (English Point,) and from there cross over to the settlement of Regauo , and a hill of the same name, on the river Le Graisse. After enjoying the beauties of the scene on every side, you will shortly find yourself at Carrillon. Opposite Carrillon is situated Point Fortune, the station which leads per stage to the Caledonia Springs, unless passengers wish to go there from L'Original, which you will reach, by-and-by, by taking the cars at Carrillon, the point you have now reached. At Carrillon you will leave the steamer, walk up to the train which is in readiness to convey you from there to Grenville. On alighting from the steamer, look after your bag gage \u2014 see it placed on the cart which is to convey it from there to the train \u2014 and then see it placed on the train. You will have a few minutes to wait at Carrillon, during which time you can be survey ing the beauties of the scene around you \u2014 and get a peep of the rapids which here pass from Grenville to Carrillon, where you are. \"All aboard,\" as the conductor says; the bell on the engine rings, and you are on the high road to Grenville. This road passes through farms in aB stages of clearing \u2014 the numerous shanties betoken ing that they are held by their original proprietors, who are struggling to see them all cleared some day, and present a very different scene from what they do at present. Pass ing through, therefore \u2014 dismal enough swamp \u2014 some good land \u2014 farms cleared and un cleared \u2014 you arrive at Chatham Station (C. E). You will remember that you are now in Canada East \u2014 the other side of the River Ottawa, all the way up, nearly to its source, being Canada West ; yon, no doubt, are aware that Canada East is inhabited chiefly by French Canadians, (Roman Catholics,) and Canada West chiefly by British, or descendants of such, (and mostly Protestants,) the Scotch people forming a large portion of the population in Canada West Passing Chatham Station \u2014 and a good many cleared farms in its neighbor hood \u2014 you shortly reach Grenville, where the train stops, and you take the steamer \" Ph\u0153nix.\" Here again look after your baggage, and see it on board. At Grenville, you cannot fail to be forcibly struck with the beauty of the scenery now disclosed to your view. Not being of a poetical disposition, we regret our inability to do it that justice, in our description of it, to which it is entitled. From this point, the steamer turns round, to start on towards Ottawa, 58 miles off (6-J- hours). To our mind, this is the finest scene on the whole trip. Tlie Ottawa here forms a sort of bay, with exquisitely beautiful 6cenery all round it \u2014 on one side a range of hills, stretching along as far as the eye can carry, wooded to their tops. The scenery reminds us of the vicinity of Ellen's Isle, on Loch Katrine, (Scot.,) only, that on the Ottawa, at this point, the hills are wooded \u2014 whilst those of the Scottish lake are barren \u2014 or covered only with pasture and heather. Passing on from this charming point of view, the steamer now goes direct up the river for Ottawa City, making several stops by the way: the first is Hartwick's old landing, next, L'Original, with its excellent pier, and pretty, quiet little town in the distance. Proceeding on, you will pass, on the right hand or north side of tlie river, the lands of the Papineau Seigniory, belonging to L. J. Papineau, of 1837 Canadian rebellion notoriety. This gentleman, we believe, still strongly adheres to his republican opinions, and is not a member in the Canadian legislature, at present. Before the rebellion alluded to, Mr. Papi neau held the office of Speaker, and at the time of the rebellion, it is said government was due him about $4,000, which, on the restoration of peace, etc., he received on his return from exile, notwithstanding that he had been one of the leaders in that movement, in 1837."], [204, "82 TRIP UP THE OTTAWA. The seigniory extends for about 15 miles, and is considered one of the poorest in Canada. As you pass on, you will observe the beautiful range of hills, to the north, which, from the different sizes and shapes they assume, present, with their shrubbery, a beautiful fringe work, to the scene all around. These hills form part of the chain, which range from Labrador, all the way to the Rocky Mountains. Passing the stopping point of Montebello, you will observe Mr. Papineau's residence, embosomed amongst trees and shrubbery of beautiful foliage. It is called Papineau's Castle \u2014 Cape St. Marie. At this point, the steamer turns to the left, leaving the hills referred to, behind you. From Mr. Papineau's house, a most magnificent view of the river, and surrounding country, must be had \u2014 occupying so prominent a position, at the bend of the river, which there forms a sort of bay. Proceeding on, you will now observe that the scenery assumes rather a different aspect, but still beautiful in its character. You sail past little islands wooded all over, and on be tween the banks of the river \u2014 which in some places become very flat, with the river ex tending in amongst the forest. At a more advanced season of the year, the river is lower, consequently, much of the water previously spread over a great portion of the country, re cedes during the summer months, and before the winter season sets in, a heavy crop of hay is reaped. For nearly eight months in the year, however, the ground is thus covered with the swelling of the river, and of course only fit for cultivation during the hot season of about four months' duration. You are now approaching to a place about twenty-eight miles of Ottawa \u2014 called Thurso \u2014 which presents nothing particular but an immense yard full of sawn lumber, belonging to the greatest lumbering establishment in the world \u2014 Pollok, Gilmour & Co., of Glasgow, (Scotland,) being one of the many stations which that firm have in Canada, for carrying on their immense trade. From off immense tracts of land, which they hold from government for a mere trifle \u2014 situated in different districts on the Ottawa \u2014 they have the lumber brought to wharves on the river, made into rafts and then floated down ; that intended for the ports on the St. Lawrence and United States, to the west of Montreal, going via La chine, whilst the greater proportion goes via the route you have been travelling \u2014 over the rapids and down to Lake St. Peter's, on the St. Lawrence, till it finally reaches Quebec. There it is sold or shipped by them to ports in Great Britain, large quantities of it finding its way to the Clyde (Scotland). Opposite to Thurso, will be observed what is called Foxe's Point. An English family of that name have settled there, and to this day they appear not to have forgot their taste for neat, well-trimmed grounds, fences, etc., exhibit ing many of the characteristics of an Englishman's home. Passing on, you next stop at probably the wharf for Buckingham, (0. E.,) 17 miles inland. Opposite to this landing is Cumberland, (C. W.) ; passing which, you will shortly reach Gill's wharf, 6 miles from Ot tawa, and the last stopping-place previous to reaching there. In half an hour or so, you will observe the bluffs of Ottawa in the distance, but i_o ap pearance of the city, it being situated on ground high above the level of the river, where you land at. To the left you will notice the beautiful little waterfall of the Rideau\u2014 a Niagara in miniature \u2014 with its Goat Island between the horse shoe and straight line fall. It falls about 30 feet, and forms one of the prettiest little falls to be seen almost anywhere. On the right hand, you will observe a cluster of wooden shanties, at the mouth of the river Gatineau, which there joins the Ottawa, and, as you stand admiring the beauty of the scenery before, behind, and around you, the steamer touches at the wharf of Ottawa City. From the deck of the steamer, you will have an excellent view of the suspension bridge and the Chauderie Falls in the distance, with the rapids and the falls, throwing up the spray all around, forming a white cloud over the bridge. At the wharf you will find vehicles waiting to convey you to any hotel or address you may wish to go to. On reach ing the top of the steep incline from the steamer, you will then obtain a first sight, per haps, of Ottawa City, which was to have been the seat of the Canadian Government \u2014 and which may be yet \u2014 should the whim or interest of the members of the provincial parlia ment not decree otherwise."], [205, "TRIP UP THE OTTAWA. 83 The steamer \" Lady Simpson,\" from Lachine to Grenville, is partly owned by its captain \u2014 Sheppard. The steamer \" Ph\u0153nix\" \u2014 on board which you will find an excellent dinner for fifty cents, {11. stg.,) \u2014 is commanded by a very civil and obliging Scotchman named McLachlan \u2014 who will be glad to point out to you the beauties of the river. From Grenville to Ottawa \u2014 a French-Canadian pilot takes charge of the steering of the vessel. Parties who go to Ottawa City \u2014 by rail, via Prescott \u2014 as described elsewhere, can return from Ottawa by the route now described, and we have no doubt they will be pleased with one of the finest river trips we have experienced in America. The scenery of the Ottawa, just described, is by no means so bold in character as that of the noble river Hud_on, from New York to Albany and Troy \u2014 still, it is one which cannot fail to afford the highest satis faction to the tourist.

MONTREAL TO OTTAWA, C. W. VIA GBAND TBOTK EAILEOAD. Take the cars on the Grand Trunk Railroad from station in Griffin Town, 1\u00a3 miles from poBt-office, Montreal. Started from the station, you proceed, getting a fine view of the St. Lawrence on the left, the mountain on the right, and the fine landscape stretching beyond, till you reach Point Ciaire \u2014 15 miles. Leaving there, you proceed on through a beautiful country till you reach the magnificent bridge which crosses the river Ottawa at St. Anne's, going over which you get a hasty glance of the Ottawa stretching far beyond to the west, assuming the appearance of a magnificent lake, situated in a basin, surrounded by finely wooded hills in the background, andr ichly-wooded country on every side of it. Immedi ately under this bridge you may observe the rapids rushing along, and also the locks where the steamer for the Ottawa River, from Lachine, passes through to avoid these \u2014 called \" St. Anne's rapids\" \u2014 from the name of the village close by.

At Prescott Junction, you change cars, and take those on the line from Prescott to Ottawa, 54 miles distant, stopping at eight stations between these points. The stranger, if newly arrived, either via Quebec, or New York, from Great Britain, or continent of Eu rope, will, on this line, get the first glimpse, most likely, of \" bush life,\" of \" shanties,\" and \" cleared,\" or \" partially cleared\" lands. The line being a succession of dense forest, swamp, and partially cleared farms, presents few or no interesting features to the tourist farther than those mentioned. Between the last station (Gloucester) and Ottawa (11 miles off) the country presents a much more cleared appearance, and a few well-cultivated farms will be seen along the line of railroad, until it arrives at the station, close to New Edinburgh, on the one side of the Rideau River, with Ottawa on the other side, about a quarter of a mile off. You will find vehicles in waiting, which will convey yourself and luggage to whatever hotel you please. Campbell's Hotel, Ottawa, we can recommend. For description of Ottawa, see elsewhere.

THE UPPER RIVER OTTAWA. A description of the lower portion of the Ottawa we have given elsewhere, in a trip from Montreal to Ottawa, leaving the river on reaching the town of Ottawa. For an authentic description of the upper portion of this wonderful river, we annex par ticulars regarding it, from a report made to the House of Assembly, some time ago. The description of the river which follows, commences at the source of the river, and proceeds on towards Ottawa, till it reaches the point we left off at : The length ol the course of the Ottawa River is about 780 miles. From its source it bends in a south-west course, and after receiving several tributaries from the height of land sepa-ating its waters from the Hudson's Bay, it enters Lake Temiseaming. From its entrance into this lake downward the course of the Ottawa has been surveyed, and is well known. At the head of the lake the Blanch River falls in, coming about 90 miles from the north. Thirty-four miles farther down the lake it receives the Montreal River, coming 120 miles from the north-west Six miles lower down on the east, or Lower Canada bank, it re ceives the Keepawasippi, a large river, which has its origin in a lake of great size, hither to but partially explored, and known as Lake Keepawa. This lake is connected with an other chain of irregularly-shaped lakes, from one of which proceeds the River du Moine, which enters the Ottawa about 100 miles below the mouth of the Keepawasippi, the double discharge from the same chain of lakes in opposite directions, presents a phenom enon similar to the connection between the Orinoco and Rio Negro in South America. From the Long Sault at the foot of Lake Temiseaming, 233 miles above Bytown, and 360 miles from the mouth of the Ottawa, down to Deux Joachim Rapids, at the head of the Deep River, that is for 89 miles, the Ottawa, with the exception of 17 miles below the Long Sault, and some other intervals, is not at present navigable, except for canoes. Be sides other tributaries in the interval, at 197 miles from Ottawa, it receives on the west side the Mattawan, which is the highway for canoes going to Lake Huron, by Lake Nipis sing. From the Mattawan the Ottawa flows east by south to the head of Deep River Reach, 9 miles above which it receives the River Du Moine from the north. From the head of Deep River \u2014 as this part of the Ottawa is called \u2014 to the foot of Upper Allumette Lake, 2 miles below the village of Pembroke, is an uninterrupted reach of navi gable water, 43 miles in length. The general direction of the river, in this part, is south east. The mountains along the north side of Deep River are upwards of 1000 feet in height, and the many wooded islands of Allumette Lake render the scenery of this part of the Ottawa magnificent and picturesque \u2014 even said to surpass the celebrated Lake of the Thousand Islands on the St. Lawrence."], [207, "THE UPPER OTTAWA\u2014 AND RIVER SAGUENAY. 85 Passing the short rapid of Allumettes, and turning northward, round the lower end of Allumettes Island, which is 14 miles long, and 8 at its greatest width, and turning down south-east through Coulonge Lake, and passing behind the nearly similar Islands of Calu met, to the head of the Calumet Falls, the Ottawa presents, with the exception of one slight rapid, a reach of 50 miles of navigable water. The mountains on the north side of Coulonge Lake, which rise apparently to the height of 1500 feet, add a degree of grandeur to the scenery, which is, in other respects, beautiful and varied. In the Upper Allumettes Lake, 1500 miles from Ottawa, the river receives from the west the Petawawee, one of its largest tributaries. This river is 140 miles in length, and drains an area of 2,200 square miles. At Pembroke, 9 miles lower down on the same side, an inferior stream, the Indian River, also empties itself into the Ottawa. At the head of Lake Coulonge, the Ottawa receives from the north the Black River, 130 miles in length, draining an area of 1120 miles; and 9 miles lower, on the same side, the River Coulonge, which is probably 160 miles in length, with a valley of 1800 square miles. From the head of the Calumet Falls, to Portage du Fort, the head of the steamboat nav igation, a distance of 80 miles, are impassible rapids. Fifty miles above the city the Otta wa receives on the west the Bonechere, 110 miles in length, draining an area of 980 miles. Eleven miles lower, it receives the Madawaska, one of its greatest feeders, a river 210 miles in length, and draining 4,100 square miles. Thirty-seven miles above Ottawa, there is an interruption in the navigation, caused by S miles of rapids and falls, to pass which a railroad has been made. At the foot of the rapids, the Ottawa divides among islands. Six miles above Ottawa begins the rapids, terminating in the Chaudiere Falls, Ottawa. The greatest height of the Chaudiere Falls is about 40 feet. A TRIP TO THE RIVER SAGUENAY. For about $12, a trip can be enjoyed to and from one of the most magnificent districts in Canada \u2014 where nature appears in all her wild and secluded grandeur. Tourists take the steamer from Quebec, which sails generally every Wednesday. To quote from one who visited this district, \" You leave in the morning, and passing down the St. Lawrence, put in at several places for passengers, which gives an opportunity of seeing the habitans, and the old-fashioned French settlements of St. Thomas, River Ouelle, Kamouraska, and many others, together with Orleans Island, Crane Island, Goose Island, and the Pilgrims. The north and south shores of the river are thickly studded with parish churches, having spires of tin which glitter in the sun like shining silver ; these, and the whitewashed farm-houses, form two objects characteristic of Lower Canada. By sunset you arrive at River du Loup. The water is quite salt, and the river, expanding to the breadth of 20 miles, gives it the appearance of an open sea ; and it is much frequented as a sea-bathing place. \" Here you remain all night on board, so as to be ready for an early start at dawn, when you stretch across for the north shore, steering for a great gap in the mountains. This is the mouth of the Saguenay, one of the most singular rivers in the world; not a common river, with undulating banks and shelving shores, and populous villages : not a river pre cipitous on one side, and rolling land on the other, formed by the washing away of the mountains for ages : this is not a river of that description. It is perfectly straight, with a sheer precipice on each side, without any windings, or projecting bluffs, or sloping banks, or sandv shores. It is as if the mountain range had been cleft asunder, leaving a horrid gulf of 60 miles in length, and 4000 feet in depth, through the grey mica-schist, and still looking new and fresh. 1500 feet of this is perpendicular cliff, often too steep and solid for the hemlock or dwarf oak to find root ; in which case, being covered with coloured lichens and moss, these fresh-looking fractures often look, in shape and colour, like painted fans, and are called the Pictured Rocks. But those parts, more slanting, are thickly covered with"], [208, "86 RIVER SAGUENAY. stunted trees, 6pruce and maple, and birch, growing wherever they can find crevices to extract nourishment: and the bare roots of the oak, grasping the rock, have a resemblance to gigantic claws. The base of these cliffs lie far under water, to an unknown depth. For many miles from its mouth, no soundings have been obtained with 2000 feet of line, and for the entire distance of 60 miles, until you reach Ha-ha Bay, the largest ships can sail with out obstruction from banks or shoals, and on reaching the extremity of the bay, can drop their anchor in 30 fathoms. \" The view up _____ river is singular in many respects ; hour after hour, as you sail along, precipice after precipice unfolds itself to view, as in a moving panorama, and you some times forget the size and height of the objects you are contemplating, until reminded by seeing a ship of 1000 tons lying like a small pinnace under the towering cliff to which she is moored ; for, even in these remote and desolate regions, industry is at work, and, although you cannot much discern it, saw-mills have been built on some of the tributary streams which fall into the Saguenay. But what strikes one most, is the absence of beach or strand ; for except in a few places where mountain torrents, rushing through gloomy ravines, have washed down the detritus of the hills, and formed some alluvial land at the mouth, no coves, nor creeks, nor projecting rocks are seen in which a boat could find shelter, or any footing be obtained. The characteristic is a 6teep wall of rock, rising abruptly from tho water \u2014 a dark and desolate region, where all is cold and gloomy ; the mountains hidden with driving mist, the water black as ink, and cold as ice. No ducks nor sea-gulls sitting on the water, or screaming for their prey ; no hawks nor eagles soaring overhead, although there is abundance of what might be called ' Eagle Cliffs ;' no deer coming down to drink at the streams ; no squirrels nor birds to be seen among the trees ; no fly on the water, nor swallow skimming over the surface. It reminds you of 'That lake whose gloomy shore Sky-lark never warbled o'er.' One living thing you may see, but it is a cold-blooded animal ; you may see the cold seal, spreading himself upon his clammy rock, watching for his prey. And this is all you see for the first 20 miles, save the ancient settlement of Tadousac at the entrance, and the pretty cove of L'Ance a l'Eau, which is a fishing station. \"Now you reach Cape Eternite, Cape Trinity, and many other overhanging cliffs, remarkable for having such clean fractures, seldom equalled for boldness and effect, which create constant apprehensions of danger, even in a calm; but if you happen to be caught in a thunder-storm, the roar, and darkness, and flashes of lightning are perfectly appalling. At last you terminate your voyage at Ha-ha Bay, that is, smiling or laughing bay in the Indian language, for you are perfectly charmed and relieved to arrive at a beautiful spot where you have sloping banks, a pebbly shore, boats and wherries, and vessels riding at anchor, birds and animals, a village, a church, French Canadians and Scottish Highlanders, and in short, there is nothing can remind one more of a scene in Argyleshire. \"The day is now half spent; you have been ashore, looking through the village, examin ing into the nature of what appears a very thriving settlement; the inhabitants seem to be all French and Scotch, understanding each other's language, and living in perfect amity. You hear that Mr. Price, of Quebec, is the gentlemen to whom all this improvement is due. That it is he who has opened up the Saguenay country, having erected many saw-mills, each the nucleus of a village, and that a trade in sawed lumber is carried on to the extent of 100 ship loads in the season. The river is navigable for ships as far as Chicoutimi, about 70 miles from its mouth. An extensive lumbering establishment is there, and the timber is collected in winter through all the neighbouring country, as far as Lake St. John, which is 50 miles further up, and is the grand source of the Saguenay. \" After having seen and heard all this, you get on board, weigh anchor, pass again down the river, reviewing the solemn scene, probably meeting neither vessel, boat nor canoe, through all the dreary way, and arrive at the mouth of the river iu time to cross to River"], [209, "THE FALLS OF MONTMORENCI. du Loup, where you again find a safe harbour for the night. Next day you again pass up the St Lawrence, stopping for a short time at Murray Bay, a beautiful grassy valley on the north shore, surrounded by wooded mountains, and much frequented by Quebec fam ilies, as a bathing place. You arrive at Quebec in the evening, thus taking just 3 days for your excursion, at an expense of about $12.\" FALLS OF MONTMORENCI, NEAR QUEBEC Few strangers visit Quebec without going to see the Falls of Montmorenci. These Falls, which are situated in a beautiful nook of the river, are higher than those of Niagara, being more than two hundred and fifty feet ; but they are very narrow, being only some fifty feet wide. This place is a very celebrated focus of winter amusements. During the frost, the spray from the Falls accumulates to such an extent as to form a cone of some eighty feet high. There is also a second cone of inferior altitude, and it is this of which visit ors make the most use, as being less dangerous than the higher one. They carry \" toboggins,\"\u2014 long, thin pieces of wood \u2014 and having arrived at the summit, place themselves on these and slide down with immense velocity. Ladies and gentlemen both enter with equal spirit into this amusement. It requires much skill to avoid accidents ; but sometimes people do tumble heels over head to the bottom. They generally drive to this spot in sleighs, taking their wine and provisions with them ; and upon the pure white cloth which nature has spread out for them, they partake of their dainty repast and enjoy a most agreeable pic-uic. One does not feel in the least cold, as the exercise so thoroughly warms and invigorates the system.

In the following pages of this part, will be found information and illustrations relating to Canada, compiled from different sources of information, as well as from our own obser vations. As a large amount of information bearing upon the present position of Canada, and the inducements it presents for emigrants, together with sketches of Canadian life, appears in other parts of this work, readers are referred to them, so that they may form a proper idea of what Canada is \u2014 in 1859. We may here remark, that although Canada does not at present offer inducements for almost any description of emigrants, excepting those of the agricultural class, and how ever much some parties have \u2014 through ignorance of the country and its requirements \u2014 been disappointed by emigrating there, under circumstances like the present, it is impossi ble that it can be long before Canada, like other sections of the world, will recover entire ly from the effects of the late panic, and present depressed state of things generally, and offer as great inducements for emigrating thither, as ever as it has done heretofore. In future editions of this work, we purpose adding considerably to the information already given, and will then have opportunities of publishing, from time to time, the con dition of the country, and what inducements there may be for emigrating to what has been termed, the \"land of hope, not to be disappointed.\""], [216, ""], [217, "QUEBEC. 7 CITY OF QUEBEC-CANADA EAST. Associated as Quebec is with so many scenes of military glory, of success as well as defeat, it must at all times possess a peculiar interest to almost every one. On its fields, and around its bat- tlements, some of the bravest of the sons of Great Britain and Ireland, America and France, have fallen, and around its cita- del, some of the most daring ex- ploits have taken place. Standing on a bold and precipitous pro- montory, Quebec has not inappro- priately been called the \" Gib- raltar of Ameri- ca,\" with which the names of the brave 'tt olfe, Montcalm, and Montgomery must ever re main connected. The citadel stands on what is called Cape Diamond, 3 5 0 feet above the level of the sea, and includes about 40 acres of ground. The view from off the citadel is of the most picturesque and grand character. There will be seen the majestic St. Lawrence, winding its course for about 40 miles, whilst the background of the panoramic scene is filled up by extensive plains, running backwards to lofty mountains in the distance, with Point Levi opposite, and the Island of Orleans in the distance, whilst the junction of the River St Charles, and the Great River, form that magnificent sheet of water, where numerous vessels are to be seen riding at anchor during the summer season. A walk around the ramparts of the citadel will well repay the stranger, \\>y a magnifi cent change of scene at every turn he takes. The city itself bears all the resemblance of a"], [218, "8 QUEBEC, PLAINS OF ABRAHAM, ETC. strongly fortified and ancient city, and, in that respect, so very different from the newly sprung-up cities, westward. The streets are generally narrow, and, in some parts, very steep, in walking from Lower Town to Upper Town, more particularly. Lower Town is where all the shipping business of the port is carried on, chiefly lumber \u2014 in export \u2014 and every description of goods \u2014 in import At Quebec, the greater portion of the immense lumber-district of the Ottawa finds a market ; vessels coming to Quebec, in ballast and cargo, return with the logs, staves, and deals of the up-country. The population of Quebec is largely infused with French Canadians, and in passing along its streets, nothing, almost, but the French language is heard. In the Quebec Exchange, there is an excellent reading-room, well supplied with British, American, and Canadian papers, and which a stranger may visit for a short time, free of charge. The tourist will find a cheap and useful little guide to Quebec, published by Mr. Sin clair, bookseller, there, in which he will find full details of all matters of interest worthy of being visited in and around the city. From it we avail ourselves of the following extract: \u2014 \" A morning's ramble to the Plains of Abraham will not fail to recall historical recollec tions and to gratify a taste for beautiful scenery. On leaving the St. Louis Gate, let the traveller ascend the counterscarp on the left, that leads to the glacis of the citadel ; and hence pursuing a direction to the right, let him approach one of the Martello Towers, whence he may enjoy a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence. A little beyond let him ascend the right bank, and he reaches the celebrated Plains of Abraham, near the spot where General Wolfe fell. On the highest ground, surrounded by wooden fences, can clearly be traced out the redoubt where he received the fatal wound. He was carried a few yards in the rear, and placed against a rock till he expired. It has since been removed. Within an enclosure lower down, and near to the road, is the stone well from which they brought him water. The English right nearly faced this redoubt, and on this position the French left rested. The French army arrived on the Plains from the right of this position, as it came from Beauport, and not from Quebec ; and, on being defeated, retired down the heights by which it had ascended, and not into Quebec. In front of the Plains from this position stands the bouse of Marchmont It is erected on the sight of a French redoubt that once defended the ascent from Wolfe's Cove. Here landed the British army under Wolfe's command, and, on mounting the banks, carried this detached work. The troops in the garrison are usually reviewed on the Plains. The tourist may farther enjoy a beautiful ride. Let him leave by St Louis Gate and pass the Plains, and he will arrive at Marchmont, the property of John Gilmour, Esq. The former proprietor, Sir John Harvey, went to considerable expense in laying out the grounds in a pleasing and tasteful manner. His successor, Sir Thomas Noel Hill, also resided here, and duly appreciated its beauties. The view in front of the house is grand. Here the river widens, and assumes the appear ance of a lake, whose surface is enlivened by numerous merchant-ships at anchor, and im mense rafts of timber floating down. On leaving Marchmont he will pass some beautiful villas, whose park-like grounds remind one of England, and from some points in which are commanded views worthy of a painter's study. Among these villas may be mentioned Wolfesfield, Spencer Wood, and Woodfield. The last was originally built by the Catholic Bishop of Samos, and, from the several additions made by subsequent proprietors, had a somewhat irregular, though picturesque appearance. It was burnt down, and rebuilt in a fine regular style. It is now the residence of James Gibb, Esq. \" In this neighbourhood is situated Mount Hermon Cemetery. It is about three miles from Quebec, on the south side of the St. Lewis road, and slopes irregularly but beautifully down the cliff which overhangs the St. Lawrence. It is thirty-two acres in extent, and the grounds were tastefully laid out by the late Major Douglass, U. S. Engineers, whose taste and skill had been previously shown in the arrangement of Greenwood Cemetery, near New York.\""], [219, "9 QUEBEC, LAKE ST. CHARLES, ETC. Leaving this beautiful locality, the walk continues to the woods, on the edge of the banks rising from the shore. The tourist, instead of returning by a road conducting through a wood into St. Louis Road for Quebec, would do better by continuing Iris ride to the Church of St. Foy, from which is seen below the St. Charles, gliding smoothly through a lovely valley, whose sides rise gradually to the mountains, and are literally covered with habitations. The villages of Lorette and Charlesbourg are conspicuous objects. Before entering the suburb of St John, on the banks of the St. Charles stands the General Hospital, designed, as the name implies, for the disabled and sick of every description. A day's excursion to Indian Lorette and Lake St. Charles would gratify, we doubt not, many a tourist. It will be necessary to leave by 6 o'clock, a. m., and to take provisions for the trip. After leaving the Palace Gate, the site of the former intendant's palace is passed. Mr. Bigot was the last intendant who resided in it. The most pleasant road to Lorette is along the banks of the St. Charles. On arriving at the village, the best view is on the opposite bank. The fall is in the foreground, and the church and village behind. The villagers claim to be descended from those Hurons, to whom the French monarch, in 1651, gave the seigniory of Sillery. In the wars between the French and English, the Hurons contributed much to the success of the former, as they were one of the most warlike tribes among the aborigines of this continent. At present, they are a harmless, quiet set of people, drawing only part of their subsistence from fishing and hunting. A missionary is maintained by government for their religious instruction, and the schoolmaster belongs to the tribe. Here may be purchased bows and arrows, and moccasins very neatly ornamented by the squaws. On arriving at Lake St. Charles, by embarking in a double canoe, the tourist will have his taste for picturesque mountain scenery gratified in a high degree. The lake is four miles long, and one broad, and is divided into two parts by projecting ledges. The lake abounds in trout, so that the angling tourist may find this spot doubly inviting. On the route back to the city, the village of Charlesbourg is passed. It is one of the oldest and most interesting settlements in Canada. It has two churches, one of which is the centre of the surrounding farms, whence they all radiate. The reason for this singular disposal of the allotments, arose from the absolute necessity of creating a neighbourhood. For this purpose, each farm was permitted to occupy only a space of three acres in front by thirty in depth. The population was in these days scanty, and labourers were difficult to be pro cured. By this arrangement, a road was more equally kept up in front of each farm, and it was the duty of every proprietor to preserve such road. Another advantage was the proximity of the church, whence the bell sounded the tocsin of alarm, whenever hostile attempts were made by the Indians, and where the inhabitants rallied in defence of their possessions. Within the citadel are the various magazines, store-houses, and other buildings required for the accommodation of a numerous garrison ; and immediately overhanging the precipice to the south, in a most picturesque situation, looking perpendicularly downwards, on the riser, stands a beautiful row of buildings, containing the mess rooms and barracks for the officers, their stables, and spacious kitchens. The fortifications, which are continued round the whole of the Upper Town, consist of bastions connected by lofty curtains of solid masonry, and ramparts from 25 to 35 feet in height, and about the same in thickness, bristling with heavy cannon, round towers, loophole walls, and massive gates recurring at certain distances. On the summit of the ramparts, from Cape Diamond to the Artillery Barracks, is a broad covered way, or walk, used as a place of recreation by the inhabitants, and commanding a most agreeable view of the country towards the west This passes over the top of St. John's and St. Louis Gate, where there is stationed a sergeant's guard. Above St. John's Gate, there is at sunset one of the most beautiful views imaginable. The St Charles gambolling, as it were, in the rays of the departing luminary, the light still lin gering on the spires of Lorette and Charlesbourg, until it fades away beyond the lofty mountains of Bonhomme and Tsounonthuan, present an evening scene of gorgeous and sur-"], [220, "10 QUEBEC, FORTIFICATIONS, ETC. passing splendour. The city, being defended on its land side by its ramparts, is protected on tlie other sides by a lofty wall and parapet, based on the cliff, and commencing near the St. Charles at the Artillery Barracks. These form a very extensive range of buildings, the part within the Artillery Gate being occupied as barracks by the officers and men of that distinguished corps, with a guard and mess room. The part without the gate is used as magazines, store-houses, and offices for the ordnance department.

Such are the prominent features which strike a stranger in the City of Quebec!\""], [221, "11 MONTREAL. CITY OF MONTREAL, C. E. The stranger, on approaching Montreal, either from Quebec by the steamer, or crossing over from the opposite side of the river, in coming from the States, will at once be im pressed favorably with the situation of the city, the business-like appearance it presents, and the picturesque scenery by which it is surrounded. Montreal is the most populous city in Canada, and in every respect must take the first rank in the province. It is situated on the Island of Montreal \u2014 which is represented as the garden of Canada, being the richest soil in the province \u2014 at the head of ocean steamship navigation, and beyond which no large sailing vessels go, although smaller vessels pass on, via the canals and St. Lawrence, to the west The city is built of a gray limestone, having very much the appearance of Aberdeen granite, with buildings of great solidity and excellence in design. The chief business street is that of Notre Dame, whilst Great St. James street exceeds it in handsome buildings, be sides being much broader. (See engraving.) The wholesale stores are situated on the wharves alongside the river, and streets running parallel therewith. Montreal is the port at which arrives the great bulk of the importations from Great Britain and other places abroad, being there either re-sold or transhipped to all parts of Canada East and West ; consequently a large wholesale trade is carried on at Montreal in all descriptions of goods. In the conglomerate mass of buildings there concentrated, are stores, churches, groceries, and nunneries, all intermixed with each other, whilst in the streets may be seen the manu facturer's cart driving alongside of the Catholic priest in his \" buggy,\" the merchant's clerk hurrying on past a sister of charity or nun at large, and Frenchmen, Scotchmen, Germans, and Americans, all elbowing each other in the busy streets of the city par excellence. No better sample of this heterogeneous gathering is to be seen than by paying a visit to the Rue Notre Dame, or Bonsecours Market, where, on a Saturday night, a mixture of English, French, German, and broad Scotch, will fall upon the ear with peculiar effect. Although one of the finest views of the city is obtained from off the mountain, undoubt ed!} the most extensive one is to be had from the top of the Catholic cathedral, in the Place d' Arm es. By paying Is. stg. you will be conducted to the top, and, if a fine day, the view is such as will well repay the ascent. There are some very handsome churches in Montreal. At Beaver Hall, St. Andrew's Church (Presbyterian), and the Unitarian Church there, form two of the most prominent in the city, situated as they are on a considerable elevation, on rising ground. The public buildings of Montreal are substantial and elegant, and consist of \u2014 PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The New Court House, on Notre Dame street, and directly opposite to Nelson's Monu ment, is of elegant cut stone, in the Grecian Ionic style. The ground plan is 300 feet by 12a feet; height, 76 feet. The New Post-office, on Great St. James street, is a beautiful cut stone building. The Merchants' Exchange Reading Room, situated on St. Sacrament street. The Mechanics' Institute, a very fine building, situated on Great St. James street, of cut stone, 3 stories high, built in the Italian style. The Lecture Room is 60 by 80 feet, height 18 feet, neatly and tastefully finished. The Mercantile Library Association, Odd Fellows' Hall, opposite the above. The Bank of Montreal, Place d' Armes, St. James street, opposite the Cathedral, an elegant cut stone building of the Corinthian order. (See engraving.)

The Museum of the Natural History of Montreal, is situated in Little St. James street, and is free to strangers. The New City Water Works. \u2014 These works tap the St. Lawrence at the Lachine Rapids, some 6 miles above the city, and will cost, when fully completed, nearly $1,000,000. The 2 receiving reservoirs, for supplying the city are about 200 feet above the level of the river, and hold 20,000,000 gallons. The Jail. \u2014 This is a substantial stone building, surrounded by a high wall, and is worthy of a visit. It has recently been erected, at an expense of $120,000. The General Hospital, on Dorchester street, is a fine cut stone building, and is one of the many prominent institutions of the city. The St. Patrick's Hospital, at the west end of the same street, is an elegant structure, and occupies a commanding position. The Protestant Orphan Asylum, situated in Catherine street, is a well-conducted charity, sustained by the benevolence of private individuals. The Ladies' Benevolent Institution, for the relief of widows and half orphans, is a large three-story building in Berthelot street It is managed solely by a committee of ladies. Nelson's Monument, Jacques Cartier square, Notre Dame street. The Lachine Canal is among the public works worthy of note. Place d'Armes is a handsome square, between Notre Dame and Great St. James streets, opposite the French Cathedral. As a place of beauty and pleasure, the ride from the city to Mount Royal will attract the traveller at all times. The distance around it is 9 miles, commanding one of the finest views of beautiful landscape to be found in North America ; and in returning, entering the city, a view of the St. Lawrence and of Montreal, both comprehensive and extended, that well repays the time and expense. Mount Royal Cemetery, about 2 miles from the city, on the mountain, is one of the places of interest about the city which many parties visit The Champ de Mars i3 a public parade ground, situated in Gabriel street, off Notre Dame. In the evenings, sometimes, the military bands play there, to a large concourse of the inhabitants. THE VICTORIA BRIDGE. This gigantic undertaking forms one of the most interesting and wonderful features con nected with the city, at Point St. Charles. It is being built for the purpose of enabling the Grand Trunk Railway to form a contin uous railroad communication with the railroads of the United States, instead of passengers being obliged to cross the river in steamers, as at present.

The current of the river is very rapid \u2014 with a depth of from 4 to 10 feet, excepting in the main channel, where it is from 30 to 35 feet deep. In the winter, the ice is formed into a great thickness, and frequently immense piles accumulate \u2014 as high as 30 to 40 feet Thus piled up in huge boulders, the water rushes through them at a fearful rate, driving the blocks of ice along, and crushing all before them. The bridge will consist of 24 strong piers, standing 242 feet apart, excepting the centre span, which is 339 feet wide. They are all perpendicular on three sides, and slope down to the water-edge against the current, so as to withstand the force and action of the float ing masses of ice, on its breaking up. Each pier is estimated to withstand the force of 70,000 tons of ice at one time. Resting on these piers, and running from abutment to abutment, is the bridge, which consists of a hollow iron tube, 22 feet high, and 16 feet wide. The centre span is to be 50 feet above the average level of the water, thence sinking to wards each end 1 foot in 130, thus making the height of the abutments about 37 feet The estimated cost is about \u00a31,250,000 stg. The weight of the iron in the tubes will be 8,000 tons, and the contents of the masonry will be about 3,000,000 cubic feet. The whole will be completed in the autumn of 1859 or spring of 1860. As is well known, the engineer of this greatest bridge in the world is Mr. Robert Stephenson of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The whole of the views of Montreal, as given in the accompanying pages, were taken for this work by Mr. Notman, photographer, Montreal, and the clear and sharp photographs supplied by him for the purpose of engraving from, affords the best evidence of his being a first-class artist. The two illustrations given of Montreal embrace the entire city, and presents a bird's-eye view of it as seen from the mountain. Being engraved from photographs, we have every confidence in saying that they faithfully represent Montreal as it is in 1859.

The notoriety which this city, in embryo, has received lately, first as being fixed upon as the seat of government for Canada, and then decided against as such by the provincial legislature, \u2014 although it had been acquiesced in by Her Majesty as the most advisable locality \u2014 has invested it with a significance which, otherwise, it would not, in all proba bility, have obtained. Ottawa is the new name given to the town of Bytown, by which it has long been known, as the centre of the immense lumber district of the River Ottawa. It is situated on that river, where the Rivers Ridea and Gatineau, and the Rideau Canal, all meet. The town is intersected by the Rideau Canal and bridge, and forms three districts, viz. : that of Lower Town, on the east; Central Town, on the west; and Upper Town, on the north-west; all of whicf, however, are on the south side of the River Ottawa, and in Canada West, the River Ottawa, as is well known, forming the boundary line between Canada East and Canada West. The town was laid out under the command of Colonel By of the Royal Engineers, who constructed, also, the Rideau Canal. Hence the original name of the town being called Bytown \u2014 although now called Ottawa, after the magnifi cent river on which it stands. The streets are all wide and regularly laid out, and, so far, reflects great credit on the engineering skill employed. Lower Town is the most important portion of the town, and, in all probability, will become the chief business part, as the population and business in creases. The two principal streets of Lower Town are Rideau street and Sussex street. In Rideau street there are several substantial, stone-built stores and dwellings. In Sussex street there are also a few ; the majority, however, are wooden erections, both old and new. In Central Town the buildings are almost all of stone, presenting one excellent street, called Spark street; whilst Upper Town exhibits a mixture of both stone and wooden buildings in its Wellington street. All the buildings in the town are exceedingly plain, but substantially built, and, being built of gray limestone, resemble very much in ap pearance some of the streets of Montreal, as well as in the granite city of Aberdeen (Scot land). On \" Barrack Hill,\" the highest elevation of the town, are situated what are termed the government buildings \u2014 the remains, however, we should say, rather than of actual buildings. There are a few small out-houses and offices \u2014 which certainly do not deserve the name of government buildings \u2014 with sundry small cannon, taking their ease on the ground alongside of carriages, which have evidently seen service of some sort These are the \" dogs of war,\" which are intended, we presume, to protect the town against all invaders. On Barrack Hill is, however, also the residence of the chief military authority of the place. The \" location\" of these buildings and the \" gun battery\" alluded to, is certainty one of the finest we have seen any where, either in Canada or the United States \u2014 equal, in some respects, even to the famous citadel of Quebec. In the rear is Central Town, whilst Upper and Lower Town are completely commanded by it on each side, whilst in front is a pre cipitous embankment running down, almost perpendicular, to the river, several hundred feet, thus completely sweeping the river and opposite shore, north, east, and west; so that, in a military point of view, Ottawa certainly occupies one of the finest natural positions any where in Canada ; and, in that respect, is the key to an immense territory of back country, valuable for its wood and minerals. The stranger, on visiting Ottawa for the first time, is apt to be disappointed that he does not find a larger \" city,\" and one more advanced, in many respects; but it must be recollected that it has been forced into public notice from the cause we have already al luded to, and obtained a publicity, with which parties at a distance are apt to connect wrong or exaggerated ideas; and if the town is not larger than it is, the fault rests as much in the imaginations of individuals, as with the inhabitants, generally, of the town itself, who, in the short time, since Bytown became a place of note, hav? beeu doing their utmost to make it \"go a-head.\" In the desire to do so, however, some of the landholders there, we fear, by putting very high prices on their lots, and landlords refusing to give"], [228, "OTTAWA, CANADA WEST. -LOWER, AND PART OF CENTRAL, TOWN"], [229, "XSaM. ONIMHOOT 'NAVOX aaddH\u2014 IP3A1 VaVNVO 'VjSAVjIIO"], [230, "20 CHAUDIERE FALLS \u2014 RIDEAU FALLS, ETC. leases at reasonable rates, have only tended to defeat the very object which they, and all the inhabitants ought to have in view, viz., giving every facility in their power, and offer ing every inducement they can, for parties at a distance to locate amongst them. In fact, the idea that Ottawa was selected as the headquarters of the government, has had any thing but a beneficial effect so far, in some respects, upon the town ; but there is the conso lation, that whether it is to be the seat of government or not, there is no doubt, that of necessity, it is destined to become \u2014 it may be gradually \u2014 the centre of a much more exten sive trade, a town of much greater importance than it is at present, and the point, round which radiate a number of other towns, and extensive agricultural districts, of which Ot tawa is the capital and centre, and, in all human probability, always likely to remain so. From it, a large wholesale and retail trade is, and must always, be done \u2014 with the districts round about ; whilst, as is well known, it is the centre of a district, which, for extensive forests of fine lumber, has no superior in America. The scenery around Ottawa is far beyond what we had any idea of, and the view from the Barrack Hill, is one of surpassing grandeur and extent, combining in it a trinity of river, landscape, and fall scenery, which few places can boast of. Looking to the west \u2014 (see engraving) \u2014 at the west end of the town are situated, the celebrated Chaudiere Falls, which fall about 40 feet, and the spray of which may be seen a long way off, ascending in the air. In the early part of the season, (say in May,) these falls are not seen to so much advan tage, the river then being, generally, so much swollen with the immense volume of water from the upper lakes and the tributaries of the Ottawa. Then they partake, in some re spects, more of the character of huge rapids. Farther on in the season, however, they ap pear more in their real character of \" falls,\" and are a sight worth seeing, although they are being very much encroached upon, by lumber establishments. An excellent view of the falls, as well as of the rapids, is got from off the suspension bridge, which crosses the river quite close to them. At the eastern suburb of Ottawa, again, called New Edin burgh, there is a little Niagara, in miniature, in the Rideau Falls, and one of the prettiest little falls to be seen any where. Although only of 30 feet fall, they present features of interest and great beauty. The town of Ottawa is supplied, in many parts, with gas. Its markets afford an excel lent supply of cheap provisions, whilst the purity of the air, from its elevated position, renders it one of the healthiest towns in Canada. Emigrants, in looking to Ottawa, will do well to remember, that it is only the agricul tural labourer, or farmer with capital, to whom its locality offers inducements at present. Amongst the schemes for connecting Canada East with the Western States, is the Ot tawa Ship Canal, via the Ottawa and French Rivers to Lake Huron, which, if successful in being established, will render Ottawa, more than ever, one of the great entrepots of that route and traffic. The communication between Ottawa and Montreal, is by rail via Prescott; also by river, per Bteamer to Grenville, rail from Grenville to Carrillon ; thence, steamer to Lachine ; thence, rail to Montreal. To Canada West, on the St. Lawrence, via rail. To Ogdensburg, via rail to Prescott, and steamer across the St. Lawrence. Distances : \u2014 from Montreal, 126 miles ; Quebec, 296 miles ; Toronto, 223 miles ; Kingston, 95 miles ; Prescott, 55 miles ; New York, 450 miles; Boston, 485 miles. Population, about 12,000. For the information of emigrants proceeding to the newly-opened districts, where free lands are to be had, full information regarding these, with routes and fares, will be found in another portion of this work. The views of Upper Town, and Lower and Central Town, as given elsewhere, are from pencil drawings made for this work, by Mr. Eastman, artist, of Ottawa. All who know Ottawa will be able to attest to the very faithful manner in which they are done, and that the engravers have preserved all the truthfulness in detail, in enabling us to present, for the first time, we believe, complete and accurate views of Ottawa, Canada West"], [231, "LOCKS ON RIDEAU CANAL, OTTAWA. 21 \u2022so[tni 1 'not*} -baboxo (Bn*}oy \u25a0saiira^ggi'uoi -10 raojj [bubo oqi jo qjSaoi ut *)! qSnojqi poss\u00abd -uibois is.ig oqi pnB '9^81 '&<[ -moidog ui po -OUOUimOO 9BAi U luoraaio -AoSqsrtuaoqi jo osuodxo oqi IB _t(oji*)uo po -lonaisuoo bbja puB 'aoj^Suig oi babi*)o mo-JJ spaoixo (bubo nBapia 3HX (Sie) OOO'SU?

The Provincial Legislature holds its meetings in Toronto, in the government buildings, a cluster of red brick buildings situated at the west end of the city, close to which is the residence of the Governor-General, Sir Edmund Walker Head, Bart, representative of Her Majesty in Canada. The public buildings of Toronto are numerous, and some of them very handsome. We have engraved, from photographs, four of the principal buildings, viz. : St. Lawrence Hall, Trinity College, the Normal School, and Crown-lands Office, in which building is also situated the Mechanics' Institute. Osgoode Hall, in Queen street, when completed will form one of the finest buildings in the city. There the Superior Courts of Law and Equity are held. Besides those named, the other public buildings of any note are the Post-office, the new General Hospital and the Lunatic Asylum \u2014 the latter an immense building at the western extremity of the city.

The two largest are the English Ca thedral and the Roman Catholic Cathedral, but both, being without spires as yet, do not present that graceful appearance which even some of the smaller churches do, although none, we should suppose, exceed the rich and handsome interior or comfortable accommo dation of the English Cathedral, as a place of worship. Toronto has several manufacturing establishments, some of them extensive, and which, in ordinary good times, turn over a large amount of business ; the city, from its central posi tion, a; rl the ready means of land and water carriage, now extended almost in every direc tion, affording great facilities for manufactures as well as merchandise finding their way all over the country."], [234, "24 TORONTO AND HAMILTON, CANADA WEST.

It possesses some excellent public build ings and churches, and is situated in the centre of an extensive and rich agricultural dis trict, which furnishes it with a large amount of trade in grain and other agricultural pro duce. Previous to the late commercial panic, few places showed greater signs of progress than London ; in fact it went ahead too fast, like many other cities and towns, consequently it has felt the revulsion all the more \u2014 and every department of business, nearly, has suffered \u2014 to revive again, we hope, when business becomes more buoyant generally. The town is lighted with gas, and supports as many as six newspapers, and five bank agencies. The streets are wide, and laid off at right angles.

The soil in the immediate vicinity of London, it is true, is sandy, and the country almost a dead level, as far as Windsor ; but you cannot travel many miles in a northern or south ern direction, until you meet with an undulating country, and productive farms, whose proprietors, of course, betake themselves to London for sale and purchase \u2014 for mart and market. Our representation of London is from one of several photographs, supplied to us by Mr. E. H. Longman, of London, C. W., and, from the excellent manner in which they are executed, we feel pleasure and confidence in saying, that the photographic art is well re presented there by Mr Longman\u2014 judging from the specimens he has supplied to us. HAMILTON, 0. W. Hamilton, one of the cities of Canada West, is situated at the south-western extremity of Burlington Bay, an inlet at the head of Lake Ontario, and terminus of lake navigation. The site on which Hamilton is built, occupies gradually rising ground for about a mile and a half from the shore of the lake to the base of the hill, called the Mountain, which rises up in the background. It was laid out in 1813, and has spread with wonderful rapidity \u2014 faster than almost any other town in Canada. In 1841 the population was only about 3500, while in 1860 it had increased to 10,312, and now has reached to nearly 30,000. Hamilton is the centre of one of the most extensive and best agricultural portions of Canada, and in its vicinity are to be seen 6ome of the best cultivated farms, not long re claimed from the primeval forest. As in most American cities, the streets are laid out at right angles, and present a fine, 6pacious appearance. The public buildings, banks, churches and hotels, which are amongst the finest in the province, are built of Btone and brick. Some of the merchants' stores excel any thing of the same sort in Toronto, or even Montreal, and are carried on by some of the largest importers in Canada, who do an extensive business throughout the country. The chief business streets \u2014 named King, John, James, York, and McNab streets \u2014 are situated a considerable distance back from the shore. The Gore Bank of Canada has its head-quarters in Hamilton, in addition to which there are five or six other Bank agencies.

These buildings, besides the immense Hall, which is used on all public occasions, and for concerts, etc., contain the common council chambers, city offices, commercial news room, agency of the bank of British North Ameri- ca, temporary post-offico, wholesale stores and warehouses, together with numerous other offices, etc., which will give some idea of its proportions. Its average cost was one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. The new \"Court House and Jail,\" now completed, stands next in order, and is, indeed, an ornament to the city, the front elevation, with its six mag- nificent pillars, being in Grecian Ionic style, and the design extremely chaste and elegant Its length is 208 feet, width 54 feet The average outlay in its construction was nearly ninety thousand dollars. The lower story is designed for public offices, above which are the court and council rooms, consisting of the assizes and county court, the division court., and county council rooms, etc. In rear are the Jail and jailer's dw elling, formingan extensive wing to the main building. The other buildings of note are, the Roman Catholic Cathe- dral, and Regiopolis College: the General Hospital, Queen's College, the Grammar School ; St. George's, St. Paul's, and St. James's Protestant Churches ; St Andrew's Church, Irish Free Church, Chalmer's Church, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist Churches, Con- gregational Church, Baptist Church, Apostolic Church, aud the old French Roman Catho- lic Church, now used as a nunnery. The new Custom House and Post-office, recently com- pleted, would be an ornament to any city. The chief public institutions are, the General Hospital, House of Industry, Hotel Dieu, Mechanics' Institute, etc. There are two daily newspapers\u2014 \" The British Whig,\" tbe first daily published in Canada West, and \"The News ;\" one tri-weekly in the Roman Catholic interest, the \" Herald ;\" and four weeklies, the \"Chronicle and News,\" the \" British Whig,\" the \" Commercial Advertiser,\" and the \"Tribune.\" One thing must not be overlooked in mentioning the lions of the city \u2014 the Public Park, which, in a few years, will be a chief source of healthful recreation \"to the citizens. Kingston has long been known for its safe and capacious harbour, which is well adapted to shelter a large fleet of vessels, besides having over twenty wharves, some of them very extensive, and furnished with capacious warehouses and accommodations for the forwarding trade. The shipping trade has long been a chief feature of the place. In addition to the ship yards at Garden Island, opposite, and at Portsmouth, at the extreme west end of the city, there is the noted Marine Railway of John Counter, Esq., from all of whi< h have been launched the greatest number and largest tonnage of Canadian vessels in Canada West. Kingston, in this particular, being only second to Quebec. A branch railroad has lately been made across a portion of the bay below the Catara- qui Bridge, to connect with the city from the main depot, coming in at the foot of Onta- rio street, at the Tetc du Pont barracks, and passing thence along the harbour to Shaw's wharf, where the branch or city depot is to be established. Kingston has, also, her Crys- tal Palace, at the outskirts of the city, in which the County Agricultural, Horticultural, and other shows are held, and in which will be held the Provincial Association's great An- nual Show for 1859. This is a large, handsome, and commodious building, which speaks favourably for the public enterprise of the Kingstonese, and the yeomenry of the county of Frontenac. Not the least remarkable evidence of the prosperity of the farming com- munity, is the large markets in Kingston \u2014 larger, perhaps, than any others in Canada, and attesting greatly in favour of the superiority of the land in the vicinity. Kingston is well defended, judging from her martello towers, market battery, and ex- tensive and commanding fortifications at Fort Henry and Point Frederick. Towards the west end of the city are numerous handsome private residences, fronting on Lake Ontario. Still further on is the private Insane Asylum, at \" Rockwood.\" The Penitentiary, situated on the lake shore, is a great attraction to strangers visiting Kingston. It is surrounded with walls 30 feet high, with flanking towers, the whole covering an area of about twen- ty acres. Inside the walls, the first building seen is of a cruciform shape, in one wing of which is the hospital; in another, the dining-hall; above these, the chapel; and under- neath, the asylum for the insane. The north part is the dwelling-house of the Warden and other officers, with a beautiful garden attached ; the remainder being occupied as cells for the convicts, who are all well eared for, and have, with their own hands, erected the walls, workshops, sheds, cells, etc. At the back, and next the lake side, are ranges of workshops, where the surplus labouris let to contractors. On the whole, Kingston seems to keep the even tenour of her way amongst the cities of Canada West, with a creditable steadiness and perseverance; is said to be one of the most healthy localities in the province; with a population of about 13,000. Kingston is repre- sented in the Upper House by the Honourable Alexander Campbell, and in the Lower House by the Honourable John A. Macdonald, the ex-Premier; the member for the county being the Honourable Henry Smith, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. The station of the Grand Trunk Railroad is about 2 miles from the city. Omnibuses ply to and from it, in connection with the hotels."], [240, ""], [241, "UPPER AND LOWER CANADA. The following information is compiled from the authorized publications of the Canadian government, official documents, and private information received : \u2014 Geographical Position and Extent. \u2014 The province of Canada embraces about 350,000 square miles of territory, independently of its north-western possessions, not yet open for settlement: it is, consequently, more than one-third larger than France, nearly three times as large as Great Britain end Ireland, and more than three times a3 large as Prussia. The inhabited, or settled portion, covers at least 40,000 square miles, and is nearly twice as large as Denmark, three times as large as Switzerland, a third greater than Scotland, and more than a third the size of Prussia. Prior to the year 1840, Canada was divided into two distinct provinces, known as Upper and Lower Canada, possessing separate legislative bodies, or parliaments, for the local government of each. In 1840 these provinces were united, although, for some purposes, the old territorial divisions still exist. Upper Canada is that part of the now united provinces which lies to the west of the River Ottawa ; Lower Canada embraces the country to the east of that river. This extensive province is bounded on the north by the British possessions, at present in the occupation, or guardianship, of the Hudson's Bay Company ; on the south and east, by the states of the American Union, and the British province of New Brunswick. The western boundary of Canada, west of Lake Winnipeg, is yet undefined. The River St. Lawrence, and Lakes Ontario, Erie, St. Clair, Huron, and Superior, with their connecting rivers, form the division between Canada and the United States. Form of Government. \u2014 Canada is a colony of Great Britain, but is as free and unfettered as an independent nation. The mother country has entrusted to the Canadians the management of their own affairs. The Governor of Canada, who i3 also Governor-general of British North Amer ica, is appointed by the British Crown, and is its representative in the colony. He nominates an executive council, who are his advisers on all matters. There are two legislative bodies, called the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council, the members of which are elected by the people. The Legislative Council was formerly filled by the nominees of the crown. The system of government is that of legislative majorities and responsibility to electors, in imitation of, and as similar as possible, to that which exists in Great Britain. All public offices and seats in the legislature are open to any candidate possessing the confidence of the people, and holding a certain limited amount of property, and being, at the time, a British subject. The elective franchise is nearly universal. Every man paying an annual household rental of 30 dol lars, (\u00a36 stg.) in the cities and towns, and 20 dollars, (\u00a34 stg.) in the rural districts, is entitled to vote. Naturalization of Aliens. \u2014 Under tho provisions of the 12 Viet cap. 197, sect 4, as amended by the 18 Viet cap. 6, foreigners can become naturalized after a residence of five years in Can ada, by taking an oath as to such residence, and the oath of allegiance, before any Justice of the Peace of the place of bis residence, and afterwards obtaining a certificate of residence from such Justice of the Peace, and causing it to be presented and recorded in any one of the courts mentioned in the sixth section of the 12 Viet. cap. 197, upon which a certificate of naturalization will be granted by such court. Before they are naturalized, we are informed that foreigners can hold and transmit real estate the same as natural-born subjects ; that they have a vote at municipal elections, although not at elections for members of the provincial legislature. The British government maintains a small force in Canada and the neighboring provinces, for protection against foreign invasion, and for the maintenance and preservation of the fortifica tions of Quebec, Kingston, and other places, in the event of a foreign war. Character of the Population. \u2014 Canada was once a French colony, and, until it was ceded to the British, possessed, exclusively, a French population. In that part of the province which lies to the east of the Ottawa River, and which is called Lower Canada, the people are chiefly of French extraction. West of the Ottawa, or Upper Canada, is essentially British. The popula tion of the province now exceeds 2,500,000. In some parts of Upper Canada there are large colonies of Germans and Dutch, and it is probable that not less than 30,000 Germans and Dutch are settled in different parts of the upper or western half of the province."], [242, "32 POPULATION \u2014 LAWS AND MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS. POPULATION OF CANADA FOR 1856-1857. Laws and Municipal Institutions. \u2014 The laws of England were introduced into Upper Can ada in 1791, and prevail, subject to the various alterations made, from time to time, by the local parliament. The laws of France, as they existed at the conquest of Canada, by Britain, prevail in Lower Canada, subject also to the alterations effected by the local parliament. The criminal and commercial laws of England prevail there, as in Upper Canada. The parliament of Canada have, and exercise, entire control over the province ; the impeiial government never interfere now, unless (which scarcely ever occurs) some great national interest is involved. The municipal system of Upper Canada is admirably adapted to the exigencies of a young and vigorous country ; its success has been complete. In order to comprehend it, it is necessary to state, that Upper Canada is divided into counties, forty-two in number ; each county is divided into townships; so that, on an average, each township is about ten miles square. The inhabit ants of a township elect five \" councillers,\" the councillors elect, out of this number, a presiding officer, who is designated the \" town reeve ;\" the town reeves of the different townships, form the \" county council,\" this Council elect their presiding officer, who is styled the \" Warden.\" Tho town council and county council are municipal corporations, possessing the power to raise money for municipal purposes, such as making public improvements, opening and repairing roads and bridges. Repayment is secured by a tax on all the property in the township or county where the debt is incurred; but no by-law for raising money can be enforced, unless it has been previously submitted to the electors or people. Each corporation possesses the power of suing, and is liable to be sued, and their by-laws, if illegal, are subject to be annulled by the Superior Courts of the province, at the instance of any elector. Each township council has the power to provide for the support of common schools under the provisions of tbe school law ; to construct roads, bridges, water-courses, etc., to appoint path-masters or road inspectors, etc. The county councils are charged with the construction and repairs of goals, and court-houses, roads and bridges, houses of correction, and grammar schools, under the provisions ofthe school-law ; to grant money, by loan, to public works, tending to the improvement of the country, and to levy taxes for the redemption of the debts incurred, subject to the proviso before mentioned, namely, the vote of the people. Villages not having a popula tion over 1000, are governed by a board of police, and are styled police villages ; possessing over 1000 inhabitants, they become incorporated villages, and are governed by a council of five, whose reeve is a member of the county council, ex qficio; as soon as a village acquires a population exceeding three thousand, it becomes a town governed by a mayor and council, and is represented in the county council by a town reeve, and deputy town reeve.

In long-settled rural dis tricts, each school section is now distinguished by a handsome brick school-house, furnished with maps, authorized school books, and elementary philosophical apparatus. The salaries of teachers vary from \u00a3130 stg. to \u00a340 stg. in country parts, and from \u00a3280 stg. to \u00a375 stg. in cities and towns. All common-school teachers must pass an examination before a county board of educa tion, or receive a license from the pro\\ incial normal school, empowering them to tej.cb, before they can claim the government allowance. The provincial normal school is a highly effective and useful institution, for the training of teachers, and annually sends forth from 100 to 150 young men and women, who, having been uniformly instructed in the art of conducting a school and communicating knowledge, are grad ually establishing, in Upper Canada, a system of common-school education of great promise. The free school system is gaining ground in many parts of Canada ; the principle it involves implies the support of common schools, open to all, by a general tax, and the non-exaction of fees. Any school section may adopt it by the vote of the majority of its inhabitants. Separate schools for Roman Catholics are sanctioned under certain regulations. The grammar schools are 65 in number, with 3726 pupils. They are intended to form a con necting link between the common schools and the universities. Teachers must be graduates of some university ; they receive an allowance from government in addition to fees. The amount raised for grammar-school purposes, in 1855, was \u00a312,000 sterling. Besides a richly-endowed provincial university, supplied with a complete staff of highly com petent professors and lecturers, there are several other universities and colleges in Upper Can ada, in connection with different religious denominations. The standard of education adopted in some of the Canadian universities, assimilates, as closely as possible, to that established in the time-honoured institutions of Great Britain aud Ireland, and the ranks of the professorial staffs aro generally supplied from the same unfailing sources. All the expenses of a full uni versity course in Toronto need not exceed \u00a360 sterling per annam, board and tuition included. To the Provincial University, and to the University of Trinity College in connection with the Church of England, scholarships are attached, which vary in value, from \u00a318 stg. to \u00a340 stg. per annum. These are awarded (at annual examinations) to successful candidates competing for them. In Lower Canada a system of education in some respects similar to that which has just been described exists, and is rapidly obtaining favour among the people. The superior schools there, however, are of a very high order, and many of the seminaries attached to religious houses are well endowed, aud amply provided with efficient professors and teachers."], [244, "34 RELIGION \u2014 AGRICULTURE \u2014 CLIMATE. Religion. \u2014 Among Canadians there is perfect toleration in religious matters. While, how ever, all religions are respected by law and by the people, there are strict distinctions jealously preserved between churches of different denominations. Tbe prevailing religious denominations may be thus classified, according to the census of 1851, from which an idea may be formed of the present strength of each leading religious body : \u2014Church of England, 268,592 ; Church of Scotland, 75,587 ; Church of Rome, 914,571 ; Free Pres byterians, 93,385 ; other Presbyterians, 82,733 ; Wesleyan Methodists. 114,839 ; Episcopal Metho dists, 49,443 ; all other Methodists, 52,449 ; Baptists, 49,846 ; Lutherans, 12,107, etc., etc. In Dpper Canada the Roman Catholics form about _ ne-sixth of the whole population, and in Lower Can ada about five-sixths. Agricultural Capabilities or the Soil. \u2014 In the valleys of some of the larger rivers of Upper Canada wheat has been grown after wheat for thirty years ; the first crops yielded an average of 40 bushels to the acre, but, under the thoughtless system of husbandry then pursued, the yield diminished to 12 bushels to the acre, and compelled a change of crop, which soon had the effect of restoring the land to its original fertility. But this system of husbandry has ef fected its own cure, and led to the introduction of a more rational method of cultivating the soil. Years ago, when roads were bad, and facilities for communicating with markets few and far be tween, wheat was the only saleable produce of the farm, so that uo effort was spared to cultivate that cereal to the utmost extent. Now, since railroads, macadamized roads, and plank roads have opened up the country, and agricultural societies have succeeded in disseminating much useful instruction aud information, husbandry has improved in all directions, and the natural fertility of the soil of the old settlements is, in great part, restored. The average yield of wheat in some townships exceeds 22 bushels to the acre, and where the least approach to good farming prevails the yield rises to thirty, and often forty bushels to the acre. On new land fifty bushels is not at all uncommon ; and it must not be forgotten, that Canadian wheat, grown near the city of Toronto, won a first prize at the Paris exhibition. It may truly be said, that the soil of what may be termed the agricultural portion of Canada, which comprises four-fifths of the inhabited portion, and a vast area still in the hands of the govern ment and now open to settlement, is unexceptionable ; and when deterioation takes place, it is the fault of the farmer, and Dot of the soil. In tapper Canada the yield of wheat one year con siderably exceeded 20,000,000 bushels ; and tbe quality of Canadian wheat is so superior, that the American millers buy it for the purpose of mixing with grain grown in the United States, in order to improve the quality of their flour. The most erroneous opinions have prevailed abroad respecting the climate of Canada, The so-called rigour of Canadian winters is often advanced as a serious objection to the country, by many who have not the courage to encounter them, \u2014 who prefer sleet and fog, to brilliant skies and bracing cold, and who have yet to learn the value and extent of the blessings conferred upon Canada by her world-renowned \" snows.\" It will scarcely be believed by many who shudder at the idea of the thermometer falling to zero, that the gradual annual diminution in the fall of snow, in certain localities, is a subject of lamentation to the farmer in Western Canada. Their desire is for the old-fashioned winters, with sleighing for four months, and spring bursting upon them with marvellous beauty at the begin ning of April. A bountiful fall of snow, with hard frost, is equivalent to the construction of the best macadamized roads all over the country. The absence of a sufficient quantity of snow in winter for sleighing, is a calamity as much to be feared and deplored, as the want of rain in spring. Happily, neither of these deprivations is of frequent occurrence. The climate of Canada is in some measure exceptional, especially that of the peninsular por tion. The influence of the great lakes is very strikingly felt, in the elevation of winter temper atures, and in the reduction of summer heats. East and west of Canada, beyond the influence of the lakes, the greatest extremes prevail, \u2014 intense cold in winter, intense heat in summer, and to these features may be added their usual attendant, drought. Perhaps the popular standard of the adaptation of climate to the purposes of agriculture, is more suitable for the present occasion, than a reference to monthly and annual means of tem perature. Much information is conveyed in the simple narration of facts bearing upon fruit cul ture. From the head of Lake Ontario, round by the Niagar? frontier, and all along the Canadian shores of Lake Erie, the grape and peach grow witL luxuriance, and ripen to perfection in the open air, without the slightest artificial aid. The island of Montreal is distinguished every where for the fine quality of its apples, and the island of Orleans, below Quebec, is equally cele brated for its plums. Over the whole of Canada, the melon and tomato acquire large dimensions, and ripen fully in the open air, the seeds being planted in the soil towards the latter end of"], [245, "GENERAL INFORMATION FOR SETTLERS. 35 April, and the fruit gathered in September. Pumpkins and squashes attain gigantic dimensions ; they have exceeded 250 pounds in weight in the neighbourhood of Toronto. Indian corn, hops, and tobacco are common crops, and yield large returns. Hemp and flax are indigenous plants, and can be cultivated to any extent in many parts of the province. The most striking illustration of the influence of the great lakes in ameliorating the climate of Canada, especially of the western peninsula, is to be found in the natural limits to which certain trees are restricted by climate. That valuable wood, the black walnut, for which Canada is so celebrated, ceases to grow north of latitude 41\u00b0 on the Atlantic coast, but, under the influence of the comparatively mild lake-climate of peninsula Canada, it is found in the greatest profusion, and of the largest dimensions, as far north as latitude 43\u00b0. The following information is from the pen of Mr. E. Widder, Commissioner of the Canada Company, and -will be found to contain some information of interest and utility to SETTLERS AND SMALL FARMERS. Price of Clearing Wilo Lands, and how Cleareo. \u2014 The clearing of wild land is always to be understood as clearing, fencing, and leaving it ready for a crop, in ten-acre fields, the stumps aud roots of the trees alone being left to encumber the operations of the farmer. The price va ries greatly, according to circumstances, but may be quoted at present, as \u00a35 cy., per acre. The payment is always understood to be made in cash, except a special written bargain to the con trary is entered into. Timber is now becoming scarce and valuable in some locations, and near the railway, the value of the timber is equal to the cost of clearing the land. Rotation of Crops, etc. \u2014 As wheat (the boast of Canada) succeeds best on a new fallow, (newly cleared and burnt laud being so called,) it is always the first grain crop. Farmers with capital, seed the fallow down with grasses, and wTait five or six years ; but the farmer with lim ited means, puts the land into crop the next year, either with potatoes or spring grain ; then follows wheat again, every alternate year, until he has power to clear enough new land for his wheat crop each year, \u2014 when the old land is laid down in meadow, and otherwise cropped, with out much attention to the usual general rules of good farming, until the stumps rot sufiiciently to admit of the free use of the plough. The best English and Scotch farmers then adopt the customary three or four field system, or otherwise wheat, and winter and summer sallow, each alternate year. The first crops are always put in with the harrow alone. It is, however, almost impossible to speak positively in regard to this question, as it seems to be quite a matter of con venience, or perhaps, caprice, as to tbe manner in which the cultivation shall proceed. We have farmers from all parts of Great Britain, Ireland, Europe, and the United States, and each person assimilates his practice, as much as possible, to the customs to which he has been used \u2014 or thinks best for the country. Produce of Crops. \u2014 The produce, per acre, of all crops varies much from year to year in Canada, owing to the late and early frosts. It is, however, generally considered, that the follow ing is a fair average of ten years, on all tolerably cultivated farms : \u2014 Wheat, 25 bushels ; barley, 30 bushels ; oats, 40 bushels ; rye, 30 bushels ; potatoes, 250 bushels per acre. Swedish turnips, mangel wurtzel, and other roots of a similar kind, are not generally sufficiently cultivated to en able an average yield to be given ; but it may very safely be said, that, with similar care, culture and attention, the produce will not be less per acre than in England. Flax and hemp are now coming rapidly into notice, as an additional resource to the agriculturist, \u2014 the quality of both articles is excellent, and the quantity obtained affords a profitable return \u2014 the climate and soil being well adapted for their growth. Tobacco has also been raised in considerable quantities, particularly in the western extremities of the province. Land Carriage. \u2014 That is, the hire of a team of two horses, wagon and driver, which will take 18 cwt. of load, may generally be reckoned at Sd. per mile, to the journey's end \u2014 supposing the team to come back empty ; cheaper land travelling than this, can, however, often be obtained by making a bargain. Log House, or Shanty. \u2014 A comfortable log house, 16 feet by 24, with two floors, with shin gled roof, \u00a318 ; log barn, 24 feet by 40, \u00a315 ; frame house, same dimensions, \u00a3S0 ; do. barn, \u00a3100, suitable sheds, etc., \u00a340. Tables, 10s. to 17s. 6d; stump bedsteads, 10s to 20s. each; chairs, per dozen, \u00a31 5s. Boilers, saucepans, kettles, knives and forks, etc., etc., about 50 per cent over the usual sterling retail prices in England. It must be borne in mind, that the settler very seldom spends money in erecting his buildings, they being generally built by himself, with the assistance of his neighbours, and added to, as his wants and increasing prosperity may from time to time require. The cost of household furniture, or rather the quantity required, varies"], [246, "36 WORK DURING WINTER \u2014 PRODUCE \u2014 WAGES \u2014 FOXES, ETC. with the ideas of almost every family. In most cases, the household furniture of a new settler will not be found to exceed in value \u00a315 ; sometimes, not half that sum ; and is often manufac tured by the settler himself. Frost \u2014 when it Comes and Goes. \u2014 The time of the setting in of the frost, and of its depart ure, varies in Canada extremely in different years. But no prudent man ought to calculate on being able to do any thing in the open field after the middle of November, or much before the first day of April. Fodder must be provided for cattle sufficient to last till the middle of May, as although a surplus may be left, owing to the early setting in of spring, yet cases have beeu known of great distress prevailing from want of proper attention on this head. Farmers' Avocations during Winter. \u2014 The new settler's avocations during the winter months are generally confined to taking care of his cattle and chopping, \u2014 that is, felling and cutting up the trees ready for burning in the spring. The underbrush must be cleared off before the snow falls. The family, when industrious, find their time fully employed in spinning, and other female occupations ; and, when it is considered, that in the newest settlements almost every ar ticle of convenience or luxury must be made at home, or dispensed with, by poor settlers, it may easily be imagined that the duties of a farmer's wife and grown-up daughters are numerous aud unceasing \u2014 for in proportion to their industry and abilities will be their domestic comfort and happiness. In the summer, from the scarcity of labour, all assist in the fields \u2014 the child of even five years old being usefully and healthily employed in some occupation befitting his age and strength. Amongst too many Canadian farmers, however, the winter is a season of idleness and enjoyment \u2014 a great portion of it being spent in amusement and visiting, to the manifest neglect of their farms and impoverishment of themselves and families. The Descriptions of Fruit and Garden Produce in Canada West. \u2014 All the fruits generally found in England thrive remarkably well in Canada ; but the plum, apple, strawberry, rasp berry, and melon, attain a luxuriance of growth and perfection unknown iu England. The melon, planted in the open ground, in most years produces excellent crops. In many places vines prosper well. Peaches are indigenous south of the parallel of 43\u00b0, or, if not absolutely indigenous, grow rapidly from the stone, and bear fruit within a few years ; although good and rich flavoured, grapes and peaches are seldom met with, owing to their culture being neglected. The same observations apply to all garden produce, which will attain a degree of luxuriance un known, perhaps, in Britain, with far less care and culture. Wages of Male and Female Servants, and Prices of Job Work, such as Carpenters and other Tradesmen. \u2014 These have varied considerably, but the average wages are as follows : \u2014 Farm servants per month, with board, \u00a34; ditto, without board, \u00a35. Female servants, \u00a31 and \u00a31 5s. per month. Day labourers, 4s. to 5s. \u2014 in harvest, 10s. without board. The wages of car penters and other tradesmen vary considerably according to the ability of the workmen ; they all range, however, between 6s. Sd. and 12s. 6<_. per day \u2014 taking these as the lowest and highest prices. These are the rates of wages to servants and workmen who are experienced in the work of the country. Newly-arrived emigrants do not get so much.* Taxes payable by the Settlers, and Offices they are liable to be called on to serve. \u2014 Great alterations have lately been made in the laws relating to assessments \u2014 the power being now vested in the municipal councils, elected by the people, to impose what rates they please. Each county, township, town, or incorporated village, elects its own council, and may, therefore, be said to tax itself. All the taxes raised by the council are expended within the several local ities. There is a small tax for the provincial lunatic asylum, and some other public buildings, imposed by the legislature. It is, perhaps, useless to go into particulars, as almost every mu nicipality varies in the amount of taxes imposed. The offices which settlers are liable to be called on to serve are numerous, but ara much sought after, as they are considered to confer distinction, and frequently emolument on the holders, who may be said to be members of a local government, in which is vested the levying of taxes, and administering the moneys collected from the settlers, for all purposes connected with their welfare, viz., the roads, bridges, schools, and improvements, and its other municipal affairs, in none of which does the provincial government now interfere. The probable Expense of supporting a Family of five or six grown Persons, until they could get sufficient from the Land to support Themselves.\u2014 Information from several per bods has been received on this head ; the amount must necessarily vary according to the wants and usages of the family. Many persons will do with one-half of what others require; and it is Note.\u2014 The wages, at present, (September, 1858,) are only about one half of the above rates, on account of the general depression in commerce, and the low prices obtained by farmers for grain. \u2014 Ed."], [247, "CANADA \u2014 THE GOVERNMENT FREE LANDS. 37 impossible, therefore, to give any decided information on this point; \u2014 the prices of produce and provisions given, will enable each individual to judge for himself. Support for a family is rarely required for more than twelve months, in which time, an industrious family should be able to raise a crop for themselves. Are Wild Beasts troublesome to New Settlers? \u2014 No. Some severe seasons, wolves in remote settlements, may annoy the farmer, but to a small extent. Sheep are, however, in the more settled districts, generally protected by a fold; and the farmer may, now and then, lose a stray hog by the bears\u2014 but many men have been settled for ten years in the province, without seeing either wolf or bear. All wild animals are getting scarcer every year, as the country be comes settled. The common Game of the Country. \u2014 The game in some parts is plentiful, and consists of deer, wood grouse, (called partridges,) quails, rabbits, (called hares,) and a great variety of wild ducks and geese. Wild turkeys are numerous in the western section of Canada. Fish are also most abundant in all the lakes and rivers, and excellent of their kind ; but an observation made by an old farmer and wealthy settler, may be added to the answer, as it is a very true one, viz : \u2014 That a new settler can earn a quarter of beef, in the time which it takes him to hunt for a quar ter of venison. GOVERNMENT FREE LANDS. The following information is compiled from a circular issued by the Canadian govern ment, as well as from a pamphlet issued by Mr. F. P. French, the government land agent, on the Opeongo Road : \u2014 The Provincial Government have recently opened out THREE GREAT LINES OP ROAD, now in course of completion, and have surveyed and laid out for settlement the lands, through, and in the vicinity of which those roads pass. The roads, as advertised by the agents of the government \u2014 appointed to the respective localities to afford information to the settler\u2014 are known as \"THE OTTAWA AND OPEONGO ROAD, \"THE ADDINGTON ROAD,\" and \"THE HASTINGS ROAD.\" THE OTTAWA AND OPEONGO ROAD Commences at a point on the Ottawa River, known as \"Fen-all's,\" a little above the mouth of the Bonchere River, and runs in a westerly direction, passing through the northerly part of the County of Renfrew. This road, and the country through which it passes, now open for settlement, is easily accessible, and the agent for the granting of lands in this district, is Mr. P. P. French, who resides at Mount St. Patrick, near Renfrew, on the Opeongo Road, a few miles from the lands which are to be granted. To reach the section of the country under Mr. French's charge, the settler must go from MONTREAL up to the Ottawa River, to a place called Bonchere Point, and thence by land some twenty-five or thirty miles westward to the township of Grattan, in which Mount St. Patrick is situated. The distance from Ferrall's Landing to the village of Renfrew is but 7 miles, and a stage is on this road in summer, which conveys passengers for about 2s. Gd. each. Thus, from Quebec to Renfrew, a distance of 367 miles, may be travelled at a cost of \u00a31 2,\u00ab. 6d. sterling. At Renfrew, the emigrant is within 10 miles of this agency, (Mr. French's,) and he will have no difficulty in procuring a mode of conveyance to take him there, and hence along the Opeongo Road, should he be unable or unwilling to walk. The first of the free lots is 20 miles from the Ottawa River, and as the entire length of the Opeongo Road is 99 miles, it thus leaves 79 miles upon which free grants are being given. This road commences at FerraH's Landing, on the Ottawa, crosses the Bonchere at Renfrew, and then taking a north-westerly course, it runs midway between the Bon chere and Madawaska Rivers on to Lake Opeongo. It is intended to connect this with a projected line of road known as \" Bell's Line,\" leading to the Lake Muskako, and Lake Huron, by a branch which will diverge from the Opeongo Road, in the township of Brudenell, at a distance of about 53 miles from the River Ottawa, forming, with \" Bell's Line,\" a great leading road, or base line, from the Ottawa to Lake Muskako, 171 miles in length, passing through the heart of the Ottawa and Huron territory, and opening up for settlement a vast extent of rich and valuable land. The Bonchere and Madawaska Rivers \u2014 between which this road runs \u2014 are important tributaries to the Ottawa, and contribute a large quota of the very best timber that annually passes down that river to the Quebec market. Over 40 miles of the road are now good for wagons, and as the remaining portion will be repaired next spring, settlers can easily take in their families and supplies at all periods of the year. For some years past, settlers have been occasionally locating themselves on the wild lands of the Crown, in the neighbourhood of this road, and as there are besides over 120 of the free lots at present conceded, those who come in future will experience no difficulty in obtaining prompt gratuitous assistance to erect their shan ties, and temporary accommodation while they are being put up. Twelve men can build a good shanty in a day \u2014 the timber of which it is constructed being always to be had on the spot. The best possible feeling prevails among the settlers, and no kindness that any one of them can render is ever denied to the stranger, no matter from what country he hails, or at what altar he kneels. Settlers are permitted to select their own lots, those coming first having first choice. The lots are all posted and numbered."], [248, "38 THE ADDINGTON AND HASTINGS ROAD FREE LANDS. As yet, the nearest villages to the road are Renfrew, Douglas, and EganvlHe. Renfrew is distant 13 miles from the first free lot on the east end. Some 13 miles further up \u2014 that is 26 miles west of Renfrew \u2014 Douglas is within 12 miles ; and again, 14 miles farther west, Eganville is sixteen miles from the road. At each of these villages there is a post-office, and also mills and stores, where all necessary supplies can be obtained. In Renfrew, there is a Catholic church, a kirk, and a free church, (Presbyterian,) in each of which there is service once a fortnight. In Douglas, a Methodist minister resides, and he has prayers there and at Egan ville each alternate Sunday. There is also a Catholic church two miles from Douglas, and another at Egan ville ; in the former the clergyman officiates once a month, and at the latter twice a month during the sum mer, and once a month during the winter. At Mount St. Patrick, and 3 miles from the east end of the road, there is also a post-office and a Catholic church : a clergyman attends once a month. The free lots on the east end of the road, for 12 miles, lie within the recently organized township of Grat tan, which is already pretty well settled. No schools have as yet been established on the road, but there is no doubt that, eie long, churches will be erected, and school sections defined. In this province, the \" Volun tary System\" obtains in regard to all churches, but tbe schools are liberally aided by the government. THE ADDINGTON ROAD, Commencing in the township of Anglesea, in the northern part of the county of Addington, near the viDage of riint's Mills, in Kaladar, runs almost due north to the River Madawaska\u2014 a distance of 35 miles \u2014 and is to be continued thence for the distance of 25 miles, till it intersects the Ottawa and Opeongo Road. The agent for the granting of the land in this district is Mr. E. Perry, r/ho, for that purpose, is now resi dent at_the village of FLINT'S MILLS. The outlines of five townships of very superior land are already surveyed and ready for settlement within the limits of the agency lying north of lake Massanoka, and be tween it and the River Madawaska. The townships are called, respectively, Abinger, Denbigh, Ashley, Effing ham, Anglesea, and Barrie. The direct route to this section is by way of KINGSTON, Canada West, thence to NA.PANEE, either by rail or steamboat, and thence north to the township of Kaladar, and the village of FLINT'S MILLS, where Mr. Perry resides. THE HASTINGS ROAD. The government agent is M. P. Hayes, who resides at the village of Madoc, from whom we have received the following particulars respecting the district : \u2014 The Hastings Free Grant Road commences on the northern boundary line of the townships of Madoc, 13 miles from the village of the same name where my office is. The latter is distant from Belleville, 86 miles ; the road is good between these points, and there is a stage carrying the mail each way, daily. Fare $1.00. The stage leaves Belleville every morning at 8 o'clock, and arrives at Madoc at 4 in the afternoon. The tract of country through which the first forty miles of the Hastings Road runs, presents a very varied aspect. It is, in general, hilly and stony, with patches of good level at intervals. The soil is a sandy ioam mixed with clay in some places, and in others with vegetable mould of more or less richness. This portion of the road is now pretty well settled, and a large number of the lots in the township, on both sides of the road, are being taken up by actual settlers. The crops of the present season were most excellent all along the road, the wheat having, so far, in these back settlements, escaped the ravages of the \" weevil,\" which has of late been so destructive to that crop in other townships. Continuing along the Hastings Road in a northerly direction, through the tract of rough land to which I have just referred, we have a fine level, or rather, gently undulating country, between the branches of the Madawaska River, emptying into tho Ottawa, This tract of good land extends for a breadth of 16 or 20 miles in a north and south direction, and extends ea3t and west to a considerable distance. The timber, chiefly hard wood, is large, straight, and thrifty. The soil is a mixture of vegetable deposit with sandy loam, and the crops, of every description, have been satis factory for the last two seasons. This tract is intersected also by a new line of road, opened by the govern ment during the present season, and connecting the Hastings Road, at the junction of the townships of Wick low and Monteagle, with the Opeongo Road, a distance of 46 miles. The climate of this part of Canada is decidedly healthy, probably the most so of any part of the conti nent of America, and this consideration should enter very largely into the account on a comparison with other territories. The country is rapidly silling up with a good class of settlers, and in the ordinary course, the lands which are given free this year, will be worth four or five dollars an acre in the course of four or hve years. In addition to the free grants on the Hastings Road, the government is opening a range of townships, fourteen in all, namely seven at each side of the road. These townships are ten miles square, and contain each about 600 lots of 100 acres. Two townships are already open for sale at eight cents per acre, and the remainder will be brought into the market very soon. Emigrants should put themselves immediately in communication with the government agent. From him they will always receive valuable and reliable advice. In order to facilitate the settlement of the country, and provide for keeping in repair the roads thus opened, the government has authorized free grants of land along these roads, not to exceed in each case, ONE HUNDRED ACRES, upon application to the local agents, and upon the following conditions : \u2014"], [249, "39 CONDITIONS OF GRANTING FREE LANDS IN CANADA. CONDITIONS. That the settler be eighteen years of age. That he take possession of the land allotted to him within one month, and put in a state of cultivation, at least twelve acres of the land in the course of four years \u2014 build a house, (at least 20 by 23 feet,) and reside on the lot until the conditions of settlement are duly perfo.med ; after which accomplishment only shall the settler have the right of obtaining a title to the property. Families, comprising several settlers, entitled to lands, preferring to reside on a single lot, will be exempted from the obligation of building and of residence. (except upon the lot on which they live,) provided that the required clearing of the land be made on each lot. The non-accomplishment of thase conditions will cause the immediate loss of the assigned lot of land, which will be sold or given to another. The road having been opened by the government, the settlers are required to keep it in repair. The local agents, whose names and places of abode have already been given, will furnish every informa- tion to the intending settler. The LOG-HOUSE required by the government to be built, is of such a description as can be put up in four days by five men. The neighbours generally help to build the log-cabin for newly-arrived settlers, without charge, and when this is done, the cost of the erection is small, the roof can be covered with bark, and the spaces between the logs plastered with clay and whitewashed. It then becomes a neat dwelling, and warm as a stone house. The lands thus opened up, and offered for settlement, are, In sections of Canada West, capable, both as to soil and climate, of producing abundant crops of winter wheat, of excellent quality and full weight, and also, crops of every other description or farm produce, grown in the best and longest cultivated districts of that portion of the province, and fully as good. There are, of course, in such a large extent of country as that referred to, great varieties in the character and quality of land\u2014 some lots being much superior to others ; but there is an abundance of the very best land for farming purposes. The lands in the neighbourhood of these three roads will be found to be very similar in quality and character, and covered with every variety of timber \u2014 some with hard wood, and some with heavy pine. Water for domestic use is every where abundant; and there are, throughout, numerous streams and falls of water, capable of being used for manufacturing purposes. The heavy-timbered land is almost always the best, and of it the ashes of three acres \u2014 well taken care of, and covered from wet \u2014 will produce a barrel of potash, worth from \u00a36 to \u00a37 currency. The capital re- quired to manufacture potash is very small, and the process is very simple and easily understood. The expense of clearing and enclosing heavily-timbered lands, valuing the labour of the settler at the highest rate, is about FOUR POUNDS currency per acre, which the first wheat crop, if an average one, will nearly repay. The best timber for fencing is to be had in abundance. CANADIAN GOVERNMENT AGENTS AND LANDS.

This caution will appear suf ficiently important when it is understood that an order, defective in any important respect, will throw difficulties in the way of its payment. 9. When a money order is presented for payment at the office on which it is drawn, the postmaster, or clerk employed, will use all proper means to assure himself that tlie applicant is the party named and intended in the advice, and, upon payment of the order, will be careful to obtain the signature of the payee to the receipt at foot. 10. When through illness or other insuperable diffi culty, the payee is prevented from presenting the order in person, the postmaster will be at liberty to accept a written order on the back, in favour of a second person, provided always that such written order is satisfactorily proved to be genuine. 11. Any money-order post-office may repay an order issued by itself, but only to the party who obtained it. The charge or commission, however, shall not in any case be refunded. 12. The charges or commissions for orders will be as follows : \u2014 2. Both classes may draw for any sum on one order up to \u00a3100 upon first-class offices, and for any sum up to \u00a350 on one order, upon second-class offices. 3. When money orders exceeding \u00a325 in aggregate amount are issued in one day, and to the same per son, by one or more officers, upon a second-class office, the postmaster of the office drawn upon will be at liberty to defer the payment of such orders for three days. 4. The money orders shall be made out upon forms supplied by the head office, and no order will be valid or payable, unless given upon the regular printed farms. 5. Persons applying for money orders will be re quired to state the particulars upon a form of appli cation provided for that purpose. 6. If in consequence of error or misapprehension in giving the name of the place of payment of a money order, the purchaser should desire to have the same changed, the issuing postmaster will take back the first order and issue another, for which he will charge commission, as on a new transaction. 7. When a mistake in the name of the payee, or person who is to receive the money, has been made by the applicant for a money order, the erroneous order may also be taken back, and a new one granted, for which a second commission will likewise be exacted. s.d.

Two or three hotels and stores, surrounded by several fine houses have been planted upon the sandy slope, still studded with stumps, rising gently from the shore of the lake. The saod, however, disappears before a richer soil, as you retire into the interior of the country. A Flour Mill and two Saw Mills stand upon the banks of the river. The Fisheries furnish lucrative employment for several boats' crews, particularly during the faU of the year. Beyond the river lies an \"Indian Reserve,\" and an Indian Village, consisting of a few frame houses, inhabited by a remnant of \" mild-eyed and melancholy'' Red Indians, pensioned by Govern- ment, and monopolising a crescent eminence upon the banks of the meandering Saugeen, with roman- tic dells and sylvan scenery scarcely surpassed even by *' winsome Yarrow.\" Opposite the town, and about a mile distant from the shore, lies Chantry Island, or rather Islet, on which a Lighthouse has lately been erected, and in the lee of which might be constructed a harbour of refuge for a whole navy, a scheme which rumour says, has been pro- jected in connection with a new line of railroad from Guelph, and urgently demanded by the inac- cessibility of this north-west corner of the province. But considering the dangerous nature of the navi- gation through the Georgian Bay, there cannot be the least doubt that it will withdraw the traffic, at least, to the West from the Northern Railroad to Collingwood, and conduce, therefore, to the pros- perity of \" The Morning Star,\" as Southampton may be designated from its position. 70 miles north of Goderich, 82 miles from Owen Sound.

In the preceding parts we have endeavoured to present some of the physical features of America, and with the engravings illustrative of such, trust, that to some extent we have done so successfully. The articles contained in the following pages refer to the social habits, commerce, man ners, customs, and, in fact, to the every-day life of the Americans, noticing, at the same time, a few of the more remarkable inventions which illustrate the prosperity, comfort, and genius of the people. OA (As1 Some of the subjects| noticed, have already been treated by others with greater ability than we lay claim to, and, although perhaps known to many, we notice them here as the record of our own observations, to render the work as complete as possible, and by the in troduction of articles on subjects not generally noticed by writers on America, we trust, that, taken as a whole, they may prove worthy of perusal. No particular arrangement has been studied as to the order in which they appear, but on reference to the index pre fixed, any one of the subjects noticed will be found at once."], [294, ""], [295, "HOE & CO.'S LEVIATHAN PRINTING MACHINE. One of the greatest sights, in our estimation, for the stranger who has never seen a printing machine throwing off sheets at the rate of 20,000 per hour, is for him to visit a machine room in one of the Daily Newspaper offices, where they are to be found work ing. There are generally elevated points in the machine rooms of 6uch, from which you can command an excellent view of this wonderful mammoth of engineering skill, busy at work; throwing off, and laying down of itself with mathematical nicety, the sheets as they come from off the cylinder, at the rate of 20,000 copies per hour. On this machine there are ten men feeding the sheets on, whilst, as we have said, the \" flyers\" lay down the sheets, ready for folding \u2014 the machine working with less noise than some single cylinder machines we have seen, when they were laboring away at 1200 to 2000 per hour. To describe this machine so as to convey a proper idea of it to parties not versed in printing machinery, is not, we fear, very easy, and after all it must be seen at work to be appreciated. We shall, however, as far as possible, describe its construction and operation, and, with the engraving which we give in another page, the reader may have some idea of it. You will, therefore, try to conceive before you, a horizontal cylinder, of about four and a half feet in diameter, mounted on a shaft, with appropriate bearings ; about one fourth of the circumference of this cylinder constitutes the \" bed\" of the press, which is adapted to receive the \" form\" of types, the remainder is used as a cylindrical \" distribut ing table.\" On this table is distributed the printing ink, by means of rollers passing over it The diameter of this portion of the cylinder is less than that of the form of types, in order that the distributing portion of it may pass the impression cylinders without touch ing. The ink is contained in a fountain, placed beneath the large cylinder, from which it is taken by a \" ductor\" roller, and transferred, by a vibrating distributing roller, to the cylindrical distributing table before alluded to. The fountain roller receives a slow aDd continuous rotary motion, to carry up the ink from the fountain. The large cylinder being put in motion, the form of typ.es thereon is, in succession, car ried to ten corresponding, horizontal, impression cylinders, arranged at proper distances around it, which give the impression to ten sheets, introduced, one at each impression cylinder, by men who are termed \" feeders.\" (See our engraving for the position they occupy.) These ten men \" feed\" the machine with the sheets to be printed. For each impression cylinder there are two inking rollers, which vibrate on the distrib uting surface while taking a supply of ink, and at the proper time pass over the form, when they again fall to the distributing surface. Each page is \" locked up\" upon a detached segment of the large cylinder, called by the compositors a \"turtle,\" and this con stitutes the \" bed\" and \"chase.\" The rules seen on newspaper pages between the columns, are termed \" column rulers.\" These \" column rules\" run parallel with the shafts of the cylinder, and are consequently straight ; while the \" head,\" that is, the title of the paper, advertising, and dash rules, are in the form of segments of a circle. A cross-section of the column rules would present the form of a wedge, with the small end pointing to the centre of the cylinder, so as to bind the types near the top. These wedge-shaped column rules are held down to the bed or \" turtle\" by tongues, projecting at intervals along their length, and sliding in rebated grooves cut crosswise in the face of the bed, the space in the grooves, between the column rules, being filled with sliding blocks of metal, accurately fitted, the outer surface level with the surface of the bed, the ends next the column rules being cut awav underneath to receive a projection on the sides of the tongues, and screws at the end and side of each page to \" lock\" them together, the types are as secure on this cylinder as they can be on the old flat bed, or, in other words, are so tightly fixed on to the cylinder with which they revolve en masse, that they are as little liable to.____J^iiiiMB*oin their position, as if they formed a part of the cylinder itself. The stranger, on seeing this monster of printing power, yet exquisite in execution, at work, is at once almost appalled, as he catches the first glimpse of it in operation. The great whir of wheels at work \u2014 rollers inking \u2014 men feeding on with clock-work exact-"], [296, "8 LEVIATHAN PRINTING MACHINE. ness \u2014 the pure white sheets being nipped into the embraces of its internal machinery \u2014 and before you can count one, a sheet has received the impression of thousands of letters and afterwards unbosomed, as it were, and laid down with mathematical exactness ; all together, riveting the attention of the beholder as it flies along, whilst he stands transfixed almost, in amazement and delight. Look at it as it \" goes a-head,\" throwing off its three hundred to four hundred sheets every minute, continuously for days and nights in the large cities of this country, and in mighty London and Manchester, in England. What is it, when we thiDk of its perform ance every day in the civilized world, carrying, by its means \u2014 to millions of hearts and homes, in the mansion as well as the cottage, daily intelligence \u2014 to the gay as well as to the mourner \u2014 a giant multum in a miniature parvo \u2014 the collected essence of the states man, philosopher, merchant, and schoolmaster, in all parts of the world, in one ! But who can calculate its powers ? We pay it a humble tribute, if we say it is a machine which is one of the most glorious triumphs of modern mechanical skill, which is as yet the crowning glory of the printing profession all over the world and \u2014 of the \" fourth estate\" of Britain \u2014 a machine of which every printer ought to feel proud, and fire him with ambition to be possessed of \u2014 that machine which renders still more sacred the power it reposes in the hands of those, who, by wielding it, control and guide \u2014 on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 the destinies of the world. All honor to the noble craft, towering above all other professions, which wields that power. All honor to the men who have placed such a machine in their hands. If Richard M. Hoe and his brothers had never invented another machine but that one, it of itself would entitle their names to be engraved on the pages of history as amongst the greatest benefactors of their race. The fact of these machines having free scope to scatter their millions of sheets weekly broadcast over the world, from the presses of Britain and America, is of itself a powerful standing rebuke to that power which has trampled upon its liberty and gagged its power, in one of the most refined cities of continental Europe. It will be a glorious day for France when she is once more at liberty to erect such a machine as that, and regain the footing it was about to plant on her soil, when its progress was arrested by a questionable power. Had Louis Philippe been on the throne of France to day, these presses would, in all probability, have been sowing there also, seeds, the fruits of which must follow wherever the printing press has free liberty to work. Our previous conception of this machine, before seeing it in operation, was, that from the great increase of printing power and speed, it must be very complicated in its con struction, after seeing the old presses of Applegarths at work, with some of the sheets placed in at the ceiling, wending their way down through tapes to the very bed of the machine, and there receiving their impressions, and from that, traveling up another set of tapes to be emitted above, and there taken off by a \" flyer,\" or person to take the sheets off. This machine of Hoe's, in construction, is totally different, and exceedingly simple. Instead of the \" forms\" and types being placed upon a flat bed, and made to traverse from one end of the machine to the other, in all about 15 feet, as referred to above, they revolve round along with the cylinder, and the machine, as a whole, presents the appearance of a single cylinder machine with ten feeders. The reader will observe in our engraving, at each end of the machine, the sheets in the act of being laid down by the self-acting \" flying,\" or taking off, process. The engraving represents a press, with ten impression cylinders, capable of printing 26,000 impressions per hour. Ten persons are required to feed on the sheets, which are thrown out and laid in heaps by self-acting flyers, instead of a man to take off for every one feeding, \u2014 in that process alone, saving ten men in taking off the sheets. Similar machines, with six cylinders, capable of printing 15,000 impressions per hour, also with four cylin ders, capable of printing 10,000 impressions per hour, are made by Hoe <fe Co. We may mention, that the principal daily papers in America, are printed with these machines. Without them, the publishers could no more print their papers, and supply their thousands of impatient readers, many miles distant, every morning before breakfast,"], [297, "DESCRIPTION OF MESSRS. HOE'S ESTABLISHMENT. 9 than they could fly to the moon. Great as the Americana are in many things, in nothing are they so great, we think, as in their printing machinery, compared with that of Britain. The mighty Thunderer of Printing-House Square, has been obliged to invite the co-operatiou of Messrs. Hoe, to produce, under the workmanship of Messrs. Whitworth, of Manchester, two of these 20,000 per hour marvels for the Times \u2014 which firm have made one also for the Manchester Examiner and Times \u2014 whilst machines have been shipped from here direct, and fitted up by American workmen, in the establishments of the Illustrated London News. Lloyd's Weekly News, and Manchester Guardian, to enable these newspapers to print their large impressions in time for delivery. One is apt to think, what the consequence would be, now-a days, if any potentate was to follow the bigoted King James the Second's example, in either Britain or America, and de cree to stop the working of these mighty civilizers of the world. Happily, we live in days more liberal \u2014 but only because, in a great measure, such machines as these have rendered them so. Again, what if old Caxton, or Ben Franklin, could look up and see a ten-cylin der machine at work, would they believe their own eyesight 1 Readers in England may see the large machines at work at the offices in London and Manchester, as before stated ; and in America, in several of the offices of the New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Cin cinnati, Baltimore, St Louis, and New Orleans daily papers. There they form one of the most interesting sights in these cities. Having seen this wonderful machine working in London, aud after seeing it again in operation in New York, curiosity prompted us to visit the establishment from whence this Leviathan in the printing world, and the world of mind, drew breath; consequently, we found our way to Messrs. R. Hoe <fe Co.'s works in Gold street, New York \u2014 such an other street as a person gropes his way through when he wishes to reach the Times office, in Printing-House Square, London ; so that one bent on such an excursion must not be too delicate either in his sense of smell, or sight ; and must not turn back because he has not the broad pavement of Regent street or Broadway, to walk upon. Arrived at Messrs. Hoe's establishment, we find a large counting-house, which, with its spacious and comfortable appliances, stands out in strong relief to Gold street outside, just passed through. On expressing our desire to see their establishment, and, if possible, 6ome of their machinery at work, we were informed that they would have pleasure in showing us around \u2014 as they will all strangers, and particularly from Great Britain ; but informed us that we would have to go to the works in Broome street We thought that the works we . iw in the court-yard behind, were the works; but we were politely told, these were only the \"jobbing\" works, and where the printers \"furniture\" was manufactured. Re ceiving a card with the address, we soon found our way to the works in Broome street We may here notice, that the works are about a mile oif; but there is telegraphic commu nication between the two establishments \u2014 rather a novelty in its way, in a private manufac turing establishment \u2014 so that any stranger going from Gold street to Broome-street works, it is known at the latter works as soon as he has left the counting-house in Gold street The works are situated on Broome, Sheriff, and Columbia streets. Before entering the works, however, we had to go to the office, where we were furnished with a ticket of admission \u2014 a safeguard perfectly necessary, when one recollects what was said of a certain Scotch machinist, who once got admittance into the printing office of the London Times. and brought away such drawings \u2014 said to be on his finger nails, and his memory together, as enabled him to produce similar machines as the Times was printed upon, for another celebrated printing establishment in Scotland. With the variety of patterns laying about, in Messrs Hoes' establishment, the precaution is not an unnecessary or unreasonable one. To describe all we saw and felt, would take up too much of our space. We may, there fore, briefly state, that the two principal articles manufactured here, are, hand printing presses and steam cylinder printing machines, from the smallest card jobbing press to the large ten-cylinder machine, and also hand and circular saws, of all sizes. In addition, however, to these, they also make lithographic and copperplate presses, stereotype planing machines, vertical steam-engines, hydrostatic presses, screw presses,"], [298, "10 SAWS \u2014 RAILROAD-TICKET PRINTING PRESS. ruling machines, arming presses for bookbinders, paper-cutting machines, letter-copying presses, etc. The two great departments, however, are the Printing Press and Saw manufacturing departments. In the saw-making department, we sav the \" toothing\" process, by which the large teeth are cut out of the plates of steel by machinery, as easily as if the knife was cutting through a piece of cheese. They are afterwards taken to the ground floor, where we saw some twelve or fifteen grindstones at work, grinding and tempering the plates, as well as polish ing the surface. In the toothing-room, the saws, whether long or square, are all rendered true by care ful hammering and the use of the level. These saws are made in great quantities, and as large as six feet in diameter in circular saws; and the long saws as much as ten feet in length. It is by the use of these immense saws cutting through a log of wood, with the circular ones flying round at the rate of 1000 revolutions a minute, that the trees in the vast forests of America are cut up, and constructed into \" sawn lumber,\" fit for its various uses afterwards. We wondered, to the heart of what solitary forest those we observed making would ere long be transported, to perform their daily work, regardless of winter's frost or summer's scorching sun. One of these ten feet long saws will cut up 12,000 feet of timber in one-day. To see them, however, in all their fearful grandeur, is when two and twenty of them are fixed in one frame, about one inch or so apart, working up and down with great rapidity, and walking through a log of 24 inches in diameter, with all the ease in the world \u2014 reducing the mighty \" monarch of the forest\" into twenty-four striplings of deal boards at one operation. In a lumber establishment on the River Ottawa, Canada West, we saw this done at a rate, in which, by the united action of these twenty-two saws in one frame, no less than 635 feet of timber was cut up in one minute ! In another part of the saw-room may be seen the beautiful smooth surface put upon them by means of machinery, altogether making one feel the extent of what that timber trade must be, when one establishment alone turns out. such quantities of saws. In this article of large, long and circular saws, we understand the makers of Great Britain have no chance in competing with the American makers, such as Messrs. Hoes, whilst in small hand-saws again, the English-made article maintains its ground. When Messrs. Hoes first started saw making, they had men from Sheffield \u2014 who went on in the way they had been accustomed to do \u2014 till they found out, that it did not compete successfully with Sheffield, and so continued until machinery was brought to assist them, and now, as we have said, the English-made article in large saws has no chance with the American. It is in the construction of their wonderful steam-printing machinery, however, which is most interesting, and here in another department will be seen printing machines in all stages, from the rough-cast cylinder, or malleable iron, or brass fittings, to the completely erected machine ready for delivery. Having given a description of their latest improve ment and greatest achievement in this department, we need not allude to printing presses further than to say, that in one of their newly-invented card printing presses, a marvel of ingenuity is there presented. Thi6 little machine not only cuts cards for itself, but prints them at the rate of from 1,5,000 to 20,000 per hour! We actually did not believe it, till we saw it in operation. It not only does that, but counts them off in quantities of 20, 40, 60 or 100, or any quantity in fact, and prints consecutive numbers on them, 6ame as the paging of a ledger, up as high as number 999,000. These are valuable machines, where railroad passenger-tickets, or such, are wanted. One of the great difficulties for some time was, how to print these tickets and number them at the 6ame time, and yet every ticket to have a different number. In this press (railroad-ticket printing press) that is accomplished, with the cards worked on to this little automaton machine in the shape of a roll of card-board. It thus enters at one end, and appears next, cut, printed, counted, and every one numbered differently. What will machinery be doing next for us! This even beats the automaton oven and baking machine described elsewhere. We had almost forgot to say, that a large portion of the works are connected with manu facturing from Spanish cedar and cherry wood \u2014 the type cases, and the other wood work"], [299, "HOTELS IN AMERICA. 11 required by the printing profession. In fact, the MessrB. Hoe manufacture every thing for a printer, excepting types and ink. We take pleasure here in stating, that Messrs. Hoe employ nothing but picked, first class workmen in every department, to whom they pay the highest wages given by any in similar works. Even the very laborers mu6t be good at what they have to do, and each and all men of undoubted steadiness, and respectability of character. They have first class workmen from England, Scotland, France and Germany, and at one time we have heard, they had actually Turks and Armenians working. When the works are as busy as they can be, fully five hundred men are employed. At the time of our visit, about three hundred and fifty were employed. HOTELS IN AMERICA. Hotels in America are generally immense blocks of buildings \u2014 sometimes a square brick or stone block \u2014 resembling a warehouse in London or Manchester (Eng.); at other times rivalling, in exterior splendor, that of Buckingham palace. They vary in size, and are fitted up to accommodate from one hundred to nearly one thousand guests, and are conducted upon different systems. Some are exclusively upon the American plan, others upon the European ; others, on the American and European combined \u2014 so that guests may please themselves which to adopt There are hotels almost exclusively frequented by Germans, others by Frenchmen, whilst the principal hotels are all patronized by Ameri cans, British, and natives of all parts of the world. Regarding the hotel conducted on the American plan, we may explain that there is a large hall, used exclusively for taking meals. All the guests sit at the same table, unless when two or three tables are necessary. These halls range from one hundred to two hun dred and fifty feet long, by about from fifty to one hundred feet broad. There will be seen, say a magnificent set-out dinner-table for one hundred or more guests, with a line of table-napkins, in upright fantastic form, stuck into every tumbler, which range along each side of the table from end to end. The meals \u2014 all previously prepared and brought up \u2014 are placed on side tables, and there delivered to the white or colored waiters, each one of whom has four or six guests only to wait upon. It is one of the most novel sights for a stranger to see in one of those immense dining-halls, a Ttfhole regiment of Sambos waiting for the signal to uncover such of the dishes as are placed on the tables before the guests. After all the company are seated, say twenty to thirty of these waiters are ranged, one half on each side of the table, behind the guests, in military line. At a given signal, each one reaches over his arm and takes hold of the handle of a dish. That is the first movement. There they all hold for a second or two, when, at another signal, they all at the same moment lift the cover, all as if flying off at one whoop, and with as great exactness as soldiers are expected to \" shoulder arms.\" This is the case in the $2.00 or $2.60 houses in the large cities. In the smaller or cheaper houses, the same formality or order is not to be seen in that respect, nor are the dining halls, of course, so splendid. In almost all hotels, there are no carpets in the dini'jg saloons, which rather detracts from the apparent comfort in the minds of those who have always been accustomed to dine in rooms nicely carpeted. In this large hall, all meals are taken ; breakfast, dinner, and tea \u2014 or supper, as it is called. The hours vary in different hotels. Generally, breakfast is at 7 or 8, a. m. ; dinner, 12 or 1 , p. m. ; tea, or supper, at 5 to 7, p. m. Some of the large and most fashionable houses have second dinners, set out at 5 or 6, p. m. The meals, one and all, may be said to be \" royal,\" in the fullest sense of that word. Even in hotels, where the charge is only $1 per day, or $3 or $4 per week, the set-out is not to be despised. For the curious in such matters, we may state what the meals consist of, at a house of that description \u2014 which will be found quite common all over the States. For breakfast, excellent tea, coffee, or cocoa; beefsteaks, mutton chops, ham, fish, pota-"], [300, "t 12 HOTELS IN AMERICA. toes, (roasted, boiled and fried) ; buck-wheat cakes, Indian corn cakes, (like pancakes,) Indian corn bread, wheaten and brown bread, butter, and eggs ; the latter, by the way, broken and emptied into glasses, and supped with a spoon. Dinner is regulated by, of course, what is in season. What is provided, may be said to contain \" all the delicacies of the season,\" and even a few which are unknown at the hotel dinner tables in Great Britain. In July last, we found at a $1 per day house, in a northern State, the following bill of fare : \u2014 Soup. \u2014 Maecaroni and vermicelli. Fish. \u2014 Mackerel, trout, and white fish. Boiled Dishes. \u2014 Ham, tongue, and chickens. Roast Dishes. \u2014 Beef and lamb. Vegetables. \u2014 Potatoes, (boiled and roasted,) turnips, green peas, cabbage, beetroot, let tuce, onions, French beans, squash, pickles, etc. Pastry. \u2014 Apple pie, rhubarb pie, Indian corn pudding, (like ground rice,) wheaten bread pudding, floating island, sponge cake, cheese, biscuit, etc. Tea \u2014 or supper, as it is called \u2014 consists of the same as at breakfast time, with an addition of sponge cake, jellies, jams and pastry, sufficient for the sweetest of teeth. At every meal, there is universally set down a tumbler of cold water. In fact, that accompanies every sort of meal in America. Considering that the foregoing fare is provided in hotels where you are boarded and lodged for $1 per day, you ask yourself the question, How is it done, and where in Great Britain could you get such fare, for any thing like double the amount of money ? In the $2 50 (or 10s. stg.) per day houses, of course the meals are more sumptuous still, there being magnificent desserts placed on the table after dinner, consisting of the most tempting of home, as well as tropically grown, fruits. In connection with the meals at American hotels, we confess we have failed, like Mr. W. Chambers, to see much of that fast eating attributed to Americans. We have seen quite as much of that in England, as at any hotel in America. At firstclass houses, in the large cities, we have many times considered them decidedly slow at meat. We have seen instances of some finishing their meals quickly \u2014 but we have seen that excelled many a score of times, in \" coffee rooms\" and \" commercial rooms\" of hotels in England, where either not being called in time \u2014 meals not ready when wanted or ordered \u2014 the unfortunate traveler was often obliged to \" bolt\" them at a rate about as fast as the approaching loco motive he was anxious to be in time for. As a general rule, people here do not sit so 'ong at their meals as they do at the tables in the hotels in Great Britain, greatly owing, we think, because the drinking customs are not indulged in so much here. At table, there is not so much ceremony and formality, and dining does not generally occupy so long time \u2014 whilst at some tables, a proportion of the guests may be men in business, who allow themselves only a certain time for meals, and as soon as done, are desirous of perusing a newspaper, in the reading room, before returning to business. The bedrooms of all hotels almost, in America, have one great advantage \u2014 they are lofty and clean, as a general rule ; the first-class houses scrupulously clean. The most gorgeous apartments of first-class hotels \u2014 or, as we may call them, the $2 or $2.50 (8s. to 10s.) per day, houses \u2014 are the ladies' parlors, drawing-rooms, and reception-rooms. Visitors, on calling, are received in the reception-rooms, which are little drawing-rooms of themselves. The public sitting-rooms are really gorgeous apartments, and such, we fancy, as many on the British side of the Atlantic have little idea of. Let the stranger enter one of these magnificent, lofty rooms, even although he has been accustomed to the Great Western at Paddington, the Euston, or any of the fashionable hotels in St. James or Albemarle street, London, (Eng.,) or Douglas's in Edinburgh, he will be met with splendor he scarcely reckoned on. On whatever point the eye rests, it is only to be dazzled or pleased. If the"], [301, "HOTELS IN AMERICA. 13 dining-halls were banqueting-halls, truly these are elysiums of ease and grandeur. Look at the walls, and they are touched off with excellent taste, in white and gold, perhaps; the cornices\u2014 the richest and most intricate efforts of the plasterer ; the windows\u2014 hung with the rarest and most costly draperies of Tournay or Bradford ; the floors\u2014 covered with the softest and most beautiful velvet-pile carpets of Bright, of Rochdale, or Crossley, of Halifax, (Eng.,) which have found their way here, to add comfort and splendor to the apartment ; the exquisitely-carved rosewood furniture\u2014 sofas and easy chairs of all imaginable shapes, for luxurious ease and elegance\u2014 and the superb grand pianos, of America's best manufac ture ; whilst the splendor of the mirrors, and the gas-fittings, and chandeliers\u2014 by their intricate workmanship and beauty, finish off the gorgeous apartment We are in sober earnest in our remarks, as all will know who have seen these palatial residences. If the Queen of the United Kingdom should visit those shores, neither Her Majesty nor guardians need fear the want of queenly accommodation, ever in the every-day life of a first-class American hotel. The ladies' drawing-room is appropriated for single ladies, or married ladies and children, and for gentlemen who accompany their wives, or sisters, and families. Single gentlemen, travelling alone, will find a gentlemen's parlor for sitting in. Such, however, are not m'.ch frequented in summer, generally. In fine weather, the gentlemen prefer to sit about the doors, in the cool of the summer evening, or in the reading-room, where the newspapers are. Single gentlemen are frequently invited into the ladies' drawing-room by the proper inmates of it, and sometimes strangers go in uninvited, by mistake. In such cases, full allowance is made for the error, and, most probably, some of the ladies will open np a con versation, and thereby make the stranger feel at once at home. The fastidious Englishman \u2014 when he enters a hotel on the American plan for the first time \u2014 ma j' turn up his nose at some things which he 6ees, simply owing to the difference of system adopted here. If he has been a commercial traveller, for instance, who, as an old stager on some favorite ground in Britain, and as well known as the village clock at every crack house all along his route \u2014 where the chambermaid will be sure to put him into the best bedroom \u2014 where the boots will be like to break his neck, and his back, too, in assisting on his arrival \u2014 while the oily waiter, with his crimson countenance in white choker so clean, stands rubbing his hands, with a towel under his left arm-pit, and the sleek and well lined host approaches to shake the arrival by the fist \u2014 such a gentleman will find a mighty difference in an American hotel. First of all, let us remind him that, in the consideration of expenses, there is a great saving here. You can live here at a hotel equal in magnificence to a Mivart's or a St. James's hotel, for 10s. (stg.) per day, and no fees to chambermaid-, waiters, boots, or porters. Your meals will comprise delicacies with which you never have been favored, even in your \"best house on the road ;\" so that if a different course is pursued here, different and better courses are laid before you. But you may wish to dine by yourself, as at home. Well, you can be accommodated at the hotel, on the European plan. Only remember, that in sitting down at the public table of a hotel here, on the American plan, you will meet with the company of the most accomplished ladies as well as gentlemen, the former being unknown guests at your \" commercial room\" tables in old England, Scotland, or Ireland. Here you will see a deference, respect, and attention paid to ladies, exceeded nowhere \u2014 not even by the politest people said to be in the world \u2014 the Parisians. If you are found to be a well-bred and true gentleman, it will not be a very difficult matter, particularly to you, a stranger from Britain, to get introduced in the drawing-room to the best of its society. It is true, that at the public dinner-table you will miss your accustomed \" president\" at the one end, and your \"vice\" at the other; you will mis3 your bottle or two of wine, or as much as you have been accustomed to \" put away.\" But here we are wrong. You may call even for your wine or spirits, and get any thing of that kind supplied ; but if you do, you will feel \" all alone in your glory,\" and be left to propose and respond to as many toasts as is usual, from \" the Queen, and God bless her,\" down to \" absent friends ;\" but this"], [302, "HOTELS IN AMERICA. 14 bear in mind, you will do all within yourself\u2014 imagining all the while a few of the old \" bricks\" around you. But the fact is, you will forget all that here. Tlie company by which you are surrounded at dinner, the magnificent styles of the dresses\u2014 the merry faces\u2014 the perfect forest of table-napkins which, stuck into the tumblers along each side of the long tables\u2014 which might groan if they had the power\u2014 the activity of the ser vants, the whole scene of knife-and-sork work, from one end of the table to the other, and the rich and good things set before you, will all combine to make you forget the com forts even of the \"Hen and Chickens,\" the \" Red Lion,\" the \"White Horse,\" the \"Stork,\" the \" Buck's Head,\" the \" Guildhall,\" and any and all of the favorite houses you have left on the other side of the water. Finished your dinner, for example, instead of a bill of 2s. 6d. sterling (62 cents) for din ner\u2014and, to say the least, other 2s. 6<_., but oftener 5s. ($1.25), for wine alone, making, as you well know, from 5s. to 7s. 6d. (stg.,) and sometimes as high as 10s. to 14s. each, when you have had an extra \"heavy go,\" for dinner-bill alone\u2014 here you have had all you could desire in eatables, for from Is. to 2s. (stg.), depending upon the house you stop at. In connection with this subject, we would refer you to a letter in the London Times of July 10, 1858, wherein a gentleman complains of a hotel at Brighton, (not, however, the \" Clarence,\") at being charged in a dinner-bill, as follows :\u2014 Soup, two chops, pease, pota toes, cheese and bread\u2014 only (?) 7s. sterling; and with half a pint of sherry wine, 3s. ; in all, 10s., or $2.50 \u2014 exactly the price of one entire day's board and lodging at one of the tip top houses in New York. If you should, however, think some of the company rather plebeian, we would have yon to recollect, that at the dinner-table here, as well as everywhere else in America, \" Jack is as good as his master ;\" and if you happen to have got an engagement in a store, you will meet your employer here at table, and he will meet you in a very different spirit, and with very different feelings, from what some \" old governor,\" you once had, would have met you at the dinner-table \u2014 if he had ever met you there at all. If it should so happen that you have not got such a nice bed-room as you would like at the hotel, all you have to do i3 to give the clerk the hint, in a quiet, gentlemanly, and affable manner, and he will meet you in the same way, and give you, most likely, the first room he can for the better. The clerks at hotels here, are obliged, as they are generally found to be, civil, obliging, gentlemanly men ; bred, most likely, as you yourself were, otherwise they could not occupy the post of book-keeper and cashier, and in many cases speaking three or four languages. If, however, you \" try it on\" with them, in the style of \" born to command,\" so usual in hotels in Britain, you will find you make one of the greatest mis takes you are apt to make in this country, for want of not knowing better how to go about matters. Some of the principal hotels in all large cities in America, are open all night; in fact, they are never shut from the morning the house is opened by the tenant, till it is closed forever by him. A fresh clerk, with fresh servants, go on duty at night, and relieve each other with the same regularity as the soldiers relieve each other at the Horse Guards. One great advantage of the American hotel is, that, being open all night, as we have said, and that you arrive, say at four o'clock in the morning, you will meet with the same attention and promptness as if you had arrived at twelve at noon ; and in some of the hotels, where there is a bar always open, you can have meals at any hour of the night or morning, just as promptly as at one o'clock in the afternoon. On your arrival at a hotel in America, you will not be saluted by a waiter or two in white cravat, black cloth suit, etc., and with an immense deal of bowing and humbug from either waiter or landlord. Instead of that, you enter the hotel, perhaps unseen ; go right up to the desk at the office ; ask for the visitors' book, (where you enter your name, and where you are from); tell the clerk you have some luggage, (or baggage as it is invari ably called,) when he will summons one of the porters of the house to bring it from the door, if there. You apply for a bedroom, the clerk presents you with the key of a room of a certain -lumber ; the porter, who has brought in your baggage, is desired to ascend with"], [303, "HOTELS IN AMERICA. 15 you to your room, and there you will find it all ready for your reception; and let you ar rive whenever you will, the bedroom you are sent to is certain to be in that state, and none of the hurry-scurrying which is to be seen sometimes in hotels in England and Scot land, when a room is not in order for a fresh guest to enter it. Your baggage laid down in your room, it will be better for you to peruse the rules and regulations of the house, which you will frequently find printed on a placard and hung up in your room. The key which you got from the clerk is intended to be used by you by day as well as by night. That is to say, keep your door always locked during the day, and when not in your bedroom, either keep the key in your pocket, or what is general, return it to the clerk at the office, who will hang it up ; and whose duty it is to receive it from, and de liver it to you, whenever you like. Any complaint you may have to make ; any thing not exactly to your mind ; any change you may want ; stamps, wafers, etc. ; inquiries as to post-office, or any thing else pertain ing to the town ; any washing requiring attendingto, there is only one man to talk to about these and all such matters, and that is, the clerk or book-keeper in the office. It is no use talking to servants ; they will pay no attention to you, further, than tell you to apply at the office. Of course, at any time, you may ring the bell in your room, and the clerk will dispatch a porter to see what you want. One of the most important assistants about a hotel here, is the clerk or book-keeper ; he is, in fact, the factotum of the establishment, and who is to be found in close attendance, as we have said, at the desk or in the \" office\" of the hotel \u2014 the latter a department almost unknown in hotels in Britain. With the clerk you make your terms for board and lodg ing on entering. Whatever terms you make, it will be so much per day or per week. In many hotels, where the charge is $2.00 per day, you will find, by making a bargain per week, it may not cost you much more than half that sum per day. In the same way with houses whose charge is $1.00 per day, yon may board and lodge for $3.00 or $4.00 per week ; and whether you bargain by the week or by the day, the bills of fare are the same \u2014 your patronage is esteemed just the same for a day, as for a week, and you can stay as long as you like, or go when you like. Only there is this to be remembered, that you had better ascertain the hours for meals, as, if you are not there at meal-hour \u2014 and lose meals \u2014 there is no reduction made in the rate per day, it being all the same whether you take meals or not. Boarding in hotels, as a regular thing, is quite common by young men in situations, and young married couples, who have not the means probably to furnish and keep up a house as they would like, or who do not wish to have its cares and troubles. Families, however, who have any idea of residing permanently in a town, furnish at once, if they have the means. We have met many young men in situations \u2014 in towns in the States \u2014 who being unmarried, board and lodge in the hotel, and do so very respectably and comfortably, for $3 or $4 per week, and feel convinced they live better, and are more comfortable than if in private lodgings. Workmen, again, with and without families, who are strangers in a town, seek out a respectable hotel, where they find it very convenient and economical, until they get either private lodgings, or rent a house of their own. We have met with several work men in the northern and western states, who, earning their $8 to $10 per week, live regularly at the hotel, paying $3 to $4 per week for board and lodging, such as is un known to the working classes in Great Britain, who have the same amount of wages, viz. : 32s. to 40s. per week. Half an hour or so before each meal, a huge gong is sounded through all parts of the house, with noise sufficient to waken the dead, were it possible. On the sound of the second gong, it is to intimate that every thing is ready, and you are desired to take your seat at table. The top, or head end of the table, is always reserved for ladies, and gentle men with ladies, seated all together. The single gentlemen take the first seat they lay hands on. American hotels are owned or leased by sometimes only one party, and in other cases by"], [304, "16 HOTELS IN AMERICA. two or three in partnership. Sometimes a man is a partner in a hotel, and a manufacturer or merchant at the same time. He will invest his money as a speculation in a hotel, just as soon as in a cotton mill, a railroad, or a bank. Again, there is one man in the States, who is lessee of no less than five of the largest houses, in different cities. The conducting of a hotel, in America, is reduced to a system as methodical and perfect as the carrying on of a cotton mill, or conducting a garrison, and hotels here are just as un like some of the hotels in Britain, as a country .draper's shop is to a mammoth sized warehouse, in Manchester or London. The hotel proprietor is generally a shrewd, active, gentlemanly man of business, who works more with his liead than his hands. In the offices attached to some hotels are two or three clerks or book-keepers, whose duty it is to answer all parties calling. When about to leave a hotel, give all your instructions to the clerk at the office. If you leave word any where else, it may be forgot. If you leave it with the clerk, it is almost certain to be punctually attended to. Near the clerk's office, there is generally a washing room, where you can wash your hands, etc., without the trouble of going up to your room to do so. All hotel keepers have skeleton keys to the bed-room doors, so that in leaving your room locked, it is better to leave all your baggage locked up. Those keys are necessary to enable the servants to clear up the room in your absence. Regarding the hotels upon the European plan, we may observe that in some of them there is a \" coffee room,\" similar to that department of a British hotel, where the guest may take meals at a table by himself; or again, where the meals are served up in the pri vate rooms engaged by guests. We may here remark that the European plan of hotel keeping is gaining ground in the large cities, amongst the first-class houses. The hotels on the European and American combined, are conducted, in every other respect, same as an exclusively American hotel, excepting in the serving of meals. It is in having a coffee room \u2014 and meals supplied at separate tables there, or in private apartments \u2014 in what the difference consists. Frequenters of first-class hotels in England, will find themselves suited in America equally as well, and, we suspect, immensely cheaper than at hotels in Britain, and with all the comforts of the elite of the houses in \" Bel gravia\" or \" Modern Athens,\" or in the \" Hotel du Louvre.\" Suites of private apartments, with bath rooms, and every modern convenience, can be engaged, fitted up in regal magnificence, either in the exclusively European, or semi- American and semi-European plan, with the best attendance \u2014 carriages, horses, and every thing which is generally attached to first-class houses. By an ingenious contrivance, all the noise of ringing of bells in tho house is avoided. An instrument called an \" annunciator,\" is placed in the clerk's office. At a given signal from any particular room, the number of the room is indicated upon the dial-plate of the instru ment, by one stroke of a call-bell, when a servant is dispatched to the room to ascertain what is wanted. Connected with every hotel there are numerous bath-rooms, and a barber's shop. Judging from the numbers who frequent the latter, and the time spent under the peruquier's hands, and in the washing-rooms attached, the Americans appear to be very particular as to their cleanly personal appearance and comfort. Parties are recommended not to be over-communicative with strangers they may meet staying at hotels, as almost all hotels are infested with a set of prowling \" loafers\" and sharpers, who are continually on the look-out after strangers, on whom to practise various descriptions of imposition and robbery. One may be officiously polite in offering to Bhow you the \"lions\" of the, city or town; another will assume to be a perfect stranger like yourself, in visiting such ; whilst a third will pretend he is travelling to the same place you are going to, and offers to take you to the proper place for obtaining a ticket to your destination \u2014 whilst he is only an employe of a \" bogus\" or swindling ticketoffice, after all. Some strangers, who consider themselves very \" smart\" at home, have found, to their cost, smarter fellow-companions in strangers in such cities as New York."], [305, "17 WORTHY OF CREDIT \u2014 TRADE PROTECTION. PROTECTION TO TRADE AND DEBT COLLECTING. A commercial traveller acquaintance of ours, once was desirous of opening an account with a very good and safe man, but such was the nature of the customer he had to meet, that the traveller was for some time at a loss how to approach him, as, from all he had heard of him, he was one of those purse-proud, ignorant, and contemptible men who are to be met with sometimes behind a retail shop or store counter, by travellers \" on the road.\" There was only one way to make the attack, as he was determined to let him understand that the obligation of doing business between individuals, was mutual, so he resolved to \" take the bull by the horns.\" Walking into the shop, with parcel of patterns in hand, and an utter stranger, although not unacquainted with the peculiarities of the man he bad to deal with, thus addressed him: \"I have called, sir, to pay you one of the highest compli ments which one man can pay to another,\" delivered with all that suavity of manner and perfect coolness with which some accomplished travellers are largely endowed. The cus tomer was taken aback from so unusual a salutation, and was brought to inquire, \" Indeed, sir ! In what respect V \" Simply, sir,\" said the traveller, \" that the house I have the honour to represent, considers you worthy of credit \" The result was, that between what the cus tomer considered the audacity of the traveller, and that he felt the truth of the compliment, it led to business between the two. We mention this anecdote briefly, to illustrate how difficult it is to do business with some men, however good value may be placed before them, but more particularly, that the man who, although at one time in the hey-day of prosperity \u2014 and whose position is one of undoubted good credit, with every one more anxious than another to do business with him \u2014 may not always remain in that excellent position, but who, a few years afterwards, may afford as good reasons why the commer cial traveller should be as desirous of avoiding his acquaintance as our friend was of mak ing it, and hence the necessity and utility of one of those \" institutions\" in America, called \" Commercial\" or \" Mercantile Agencies,\" connected with which, is that of Debt Collecting. The system of Trade Protection Societies, as carried out in Great Britain is in its infancy when compared with the system in operation in America. Where is the protection society there, for example, that can produce in its office a record of the commercial standing of every man in business from Penzance to John O'Groat' ', or from Ballycastle to Dundrum Bay. It is true, that such as Messrs. Perry of London have a register of all London traders only, and may procure information, perhaps, regarding men at a distance ; or it may be that a Trade Protection Association in Manchester or Leeds can give information about parties in those districts to their members writing to, or calling at their offices, but if infor mation is wanted about a man in Wick, (Orkney,) Enniskillen, (Ireland,) or Truro, (Corn wall,) or other more out of the way places than these, they have to write and procure the information, and ten chances to one if they nave correspondents there from whom they can get any information at all. The mercantile or commercial agencies of America are conducted by private firms \u2014 whose standing can be easily ascertained by parties desirous of employing them\u2014 thus doing away with the objections to boards of directors about such establishments. They are carried on upon an immense scale, with agents and correspondents raraificating throughout the whole of the Union and Canada, and now we understand they are extend ing their business to Great Britain, Ireland, and the continent of Europe. Their register of traders extends to every man engaged in business in every town and county in all the states and territories of America, as well as in Canada. This may be termed their \" Trade Protection\" department In this department sets of books are kept, in which is entered the name, trade, and address of every man who is in business, whether that is in New Orleans or Nova Scotia, in California or Canada. In a certain folio in a ledger, every man's name is entered, followed up by a variety of particulars, such as when he commenced business, what means he had, what was his moral character and business abilities, his mar riage or family connections, etc., etc., bo as to present a complete history of every trader from the date he started in business. Thus far, then, every man's character and circum-"], [306, "18 MERCANTILE AGENCY SYSTEM. stances are \" posted up\" into one of the ledgers of the firm. At the end of every six months, a fresh entry is made at his folio in the ledger, detailing any fresh circumstances which may have arisen to alter the private or business character of the trader. Thus, for example, if he began ten years ago, there is an entry made at the end of every six months, showing all the circumstances attending his career down to the present day ; at all events, so far as has been possible for the mercantile agency to get to know. Thus, then, Mr. John Smith may have been in good standing when he started business, went on all right, and made money. At the end of the first year, stood reported in the agencies' books ; \" perfectly trustworthy\" at the end of the second year, however, the report stood that he was \" given more to his rifle and dogs than to industry ;\" at the end of the fifth report, or six months after the last, \" seen frequenting drinking saloons too often \u2014 caution necessary in giving credit;\" whilst after other two reports, or at the end of other twelve months, the report stands, \"accom modation paper going freely between him and another house \u2014 credit fast on the decline ;\" at the end of the next six months, the report says, \" sold out to Mr. A. B., who has re-sold out to Mr. C. D.,\" evidently a swindle, thus putting a very fatal report upon his future career. During the last two years or so, houses who have been desirous of knowing something of Mr. Smith, with the view of trying to do business with him, or others who have been doing business with him, have got uneasy as to reports they have heard respecting him, so that Messrs. Cotton, Cloth ife Co., or Messrs. Brandy, Wine & Co., and many others, being mem bers of the agency, send to inquire what report it has as to Mr. Smith's character, when they are furnished with his whole career, as embodied in those reports. When these houses make inquiries as to his position, that fact also is entered in his folio in the ledger, so that when the report is received that he has \" sold out to Mr. A. B., and who has re-sold out again to Mr. C. D.,\" a note is dispatched by messengers, if in town, or telegraphed to a distance to the houses, who had made inquiries some time previous, to call at the agency, when they are shown the information just received, regarding Mr. Smith; upon receiving which, they at once take steps to recover. In the course of men's business lives, a variety of circumstances transpire, some of which have very injurious effects upon their commer cial standing. All these, so far as can be ascertained, are recorded. We have given the foregoing illustration to show the modus operandi of the system, which is similar in some respects to the Trade Protection Societies in Britain, but we think, with this additional ad vantage, that, as we have said before, whilst a society located at Glasgow or Edinburgh has no record of houses at Galway, or St. Ives, or Clonakilty, or Abergavenny, they are obliged to write to their correspondents in those towns if they have any, before they can get an swers regarding parties there, when inquired after. Here, however, the name and stand ing of every trader is kept \" posted up\" on the premises. They have no occasion to write. A member calls, and gets to see at once the position the man holds as there recorded, which is undoubtedly in advance, and superior, in our opinion, to the system at present in exist ence in Great Britain. Again, the firms who conduct these agencies have no interest but to give faithful representations to all their members alike. The records in their ledgers are open to their members, respecting their customers, wherever situated, and the information there recorded, is obtained by correspondents, residing permanently or travelling, going over particular sections of the country. Another means, however \u2014 and as far as it goes, one of the best means, of knowing the \" paying\" position men are in \u2014 is in the vast amount of business these agencies get to do, in the way of collecting debts. This brings us to the other department of their business, viz., Debt Collecting. The Trade Protection Societies in England and Scotland sometime ago annexed this branch to their inquiry, or protection to trade department, for the use of their members, and we believe have worked it very suc cessfully, often recovering debts, when the principals could not get one penny by direct application. In this department of the mercantile and commercial agencies, debts are col lected for the general public as well as for members, which all the more extends their facil ities for acquiring business information, and makes the department of great magnitude in the amount of business transacted. In such an extent of country as this is, it will at once be seen the great advantages which"], [307, "19 DEBT COLLECTING \u2014 BANKS AND BANKING. Buch agencies present to mercantile men, say in New York or Philadelphia, who can get their accounts collected for a trifle through this means, although fifteen hundred or two thousand miles distant, these agencies having correspondents or agents every where, and besides their regular correspondents, they have intimate connections with banks \u2014 the officers of which communicate freely with them \u2014 expecting like facilities in return, when their business may need them. They have also correspondence with attorneys, who keep them advised of suits, encumbrances upon the real estate which parties may possess, and other information derivable from tiie public records. They have thus, abundant means of \" checking\" the information furnished by regular correspondents \u2014 and avoiding injustice, which might be done by misrepresentation, if entire dependence was placed upon reports from one source \u2014 as most men, however good and reliable, upon the whole, have their own interest to take care of. Indeed, such information must always, of ne cessity, be strictly guarded, and, to a certain extent, it must be secret \u2014 one merchant writ ing to another on such subjects, always expecting and enjoining secrecy \u2014 and would think himself badly used if his injunction was disregarded. Little, wa think, Co some of the small store-keepers consider that their moral and busi ness oharacter is ao narrowly watched, bo carefully recorded, and taken such good care of, in a regular debtor and creditor account of their virtues and successes, placed against their vices and misfortunes, and those carefully added up every 6ix months, and the balance then struck as to what the report should be in the books of the commercial or mercantile agencies. But so it is. As an institution, these agencies may be objected to by some ; but, taking any little disadvantages they may appear to present, we think, on the whole, that in the hands of respectable men, they are calculated to assist very materially every man in avoiding \u2014 what every man is anxious to avoid \u2014 making a bad debt ; or if, after goods are sold to a doubtful customer, they prove of value in assisting in the recovery of the money, or getting security for the debt There is no doubt but that the system is an inquisitorial one in some respects, but not more so than is in operation by some London and Manchester houses, who keep such regis ters of all their customers, and the amount they are worthy of credit for, and who, by means of their travellers covering the ground, and their own private \" bailiff\" \u2014 as a depart ment of the counting house \u2014 who is retained to look after all long-winded customers, and who holds himself in readiness to be despatched at any moment of night or day, with the peremptory orders in his pocket of \u2014 cash \u2014 security \u2014 or bankruptcy, to fire red hot into the unfortunate customer who has a screw or two loose, or even fancied to be loose. The sys tem of commercial agencies is only that, carried out for the whole business community, what many firms do on their own account. Members pay a certain amount yearly, and are furnished with replies to any inquiries they may make respecting the circumstances and character of traders. Some of these establishments have branch offices in the principal cities all over the States and Canada. One of them, the oldest and largest, (B. Douglass & Co.,) having as many as 19 offices in different parts, and employing in the aggregate nearly 400 clerks \u2014 over 130 being em ployed at the chief office in New York alone. BANKS AND BANKING. In America there is no \"Bank of America, ' as one institution \u2014 similar to the old lady in Treadneedle street, London \u2014 who, in a fit of the fidgets, or an affection of spasms, occa sionally spreads her effects through the veins of the commercial body throughout the whole world, cramping up and levelling, in one day, all the paper-houses and castles in the air of the most wide-awake speculator, or who, some other day \u2014 when she feels inclined to be liberal \u2014 from the fact of having more gold in her coffers than she knows what to do with \u2014 will open her purse, as well as her heart, and discount more freely at a low rate, affording relief to the distressed broker with settling-day not far off, and in fact to every"], [308, "20 BANKS IN AMERICA. one \u2014 even from Rothschild, who may have been negotiating a loan for some \" foreign power,\" who is not powerful enough to make ends meet \u2014 down to the poorest workmen out of employment, who when life, activity, and confidence has emanated from the old lady referred to, is again in the receipt of weekly wages. In England the system cen tres in one, alike in banking, as well as in government. In America it is in banking as in government.thorough republican, all upon one footing. In some of the Western State3, aU can issue notes, from the best and wealthiest joint stock concern, who affords to its customers the security of the State, down to the speculative \"Wild-Cat\" banker, who does not trouble himself about anybody's security and safety but his own, and who, in the issue of the notes of his bank, or, as they are termed, \" Shin plasters,\" trusts to a long-eared public taking them as fast as those of any other bank. To give any thing like an adequate idea as to the banking system, in America, and the different methods on which it is conducted in different States, would require a volume, so we can only merely glance at some of its features, at present. Any man, or body of men can open, and carry on a bank, and issue their own notes, the law requiring, that to be a legitimate banking institution, affording the greatest possi ble security, it should deposit, in the hands of the comptroller of the State in which it is, government stocks to the value of its issue. For example \u2014 a bank is started with $500,000, (\u00a3100,000,) and out of that capital, an issue of notes to the extent of $100,000 is wanted. The proprietors go and purchase State stocks to the value of the $100,000 and take these to the comptroller of the banking department of the State, who, having received these State stocks, countersigns the bank notes, (or \" bank bills,\" as they are called,) for those parties for that amount of stocks which they have pledged, or deposited with him. The safety to the public, who take these notes, consists in having the notes secured in the manner stated. The public holding such notes in the event of such a bank suspending payment, have recourse upon the comptroller, who \" winds up\" the concern, and pays the note-holders, the amount of the notes, subject to a deduction for expenses incurred in winding up. In such cases, the note-holders have to wait some time, before the matters of such concerns are settled, and hope for as near 100 cents to the dollar, as possible. No such bank can issue more than the quantity they have given pledges for, because every note bears on its face, the signature of the comptroller, and he will not sign his name for more than he has received value for. Banks, whose safety to the public are thus secured, have on the face of their notes the words printed \u2014 \"Secured by the pledge of public stocks,\" and in addition to having the sig natures of the president and cashier of th. bank, the note is stamped thus in oval form, generally, \" Countersigned and Registered in the Bank Department.\" Then follows the signature of the comptroller, specifying, also, of what State. Thus far, then, as one sample \u2014 as to the issue of legitimate paper, or bank bills, or noteB. Depositors have no recourse, as in Britain, upon the shareholders of any joint stock bank. They have to take their proportion of a dividend out of the estate of such\u2014 as in any other ordinary suspension or bankruptcy. This was illustrated in the case of the Ohio Life and Trust Company of Cincinnati, which was a banking institution, and, previous to its suspen sion in October, 1857, enjoyed the greatest amount of public confidence, and was looked upon as safe a concern as the Bank of England itself. Those who had deposited their funds there, had no recourse against the individual members or shareholders of that company. It may be remembered, that it was the very first to succumb to the pressure, of either mis management or some other cause, and the concern which sounded the first key-note of dis trust, suffering, and want of confidence which has spread all over the world, and which, even now, is far from having recovered from it. An immense amount of banking is carried on by men who issue no notes, and who as sume the title of banker, and who are just as much entitled to it, and as worthy of it as Glyn, Mills & Co., or Coutts <fe Co., of London, who, of course, as is well known, issue no notes of their own."], [309, "21 WILD-CAT BANKING. Such men carry on their business\u2014 and most extensively\u2014 on similar principles to the aforesaid London bankers, and are to be found in all the chief cities and towns in the States. In cities or towns where there is no bank constituted as we have explained, and who issues its own notes, the trading community are necessitated to keep their money in the hands of private bankers, and depend upon them for discounting bills and receiv ing temporary assistance at any particular time. With banking, they connect the \" exchange\" business, a branch of business little known, comparatively speaking, by the great mass of the people in Britain, arising, no doubt, from the fact that the matter of exchange, or rather, the difference in the value of money in bank notes is not affected by differences in locality so much in Great Britain as is the case in America. This leads us into the matter of exchange, which we will notice by itself. Before we dismiss the matter of banks of issue, we will refer to the system of Wild-Cat Banking as it is called. WILD-CAT BANKING. We cannot explain how it is that the banking genus homo has thus been connected with the untamed of the feline species; certain it is, however, that the signification is well understood, and a \" wild-cat\" bank note, if suspected, is looked at and handled as a man would handle a hot poker, and if he should have been unfortunate enough to burn his fingers by the operation, he very often suffers in silence, till he puts it into the hands of some one else who is not aware of its qvality, and who, in travelling, may pay it away quite innocently 1000 miles off in two days afterwards, its appearance being hailed, per haps, as a small god-send, by some one who has not seen the \" colour\" of money for some time. In this way \" wild-cat\" bank notes get into circulation, and continue, sometimes for long periods, absent from home. Thousands and tens of thousands of dollars' worth of those notes are in circulation ; over the Western States more particularly. They have cost the \" wild-cat\" only the paper, engraving, and his business-like signature to them, with the \"promise to pay,\" on demand, too, but forgetting to add, even by way of nota bene, if he is able and willing. His game sometimes is, after he has got out as many as he cares about having out, or can get out, perhaps some friend raises a \" hue and cry\" as to tbe stability of his bank, and he, poor unfortunate ('.), what can he do but decline business \u2014 \" collapse,\" \" burst up,\" or put a printed placard on his shutters, \" Gone to Kansas,\" if not for change of air, certainly for change of scene, for future operations. It happens, however, sometimes, that such \" wild-cat\" concerns go on for years, and make a sort of legitimate banking business out of it, so long as it answers their purpose. As an assistance for the detection of wild-cat, and all spurious or \" broken bank\" notes, see our notice headed \" Bank Note Reporters.\" Ab illustrative of something akin to this description of banking, and having reference to State Stock Banks, (or banks having their notes secured by the deposit of State stocks as already explained,) we give the following quotation from the St. Louis Evening News, of 3d September, as showing that even that description of bank bills are tampered with, and circulated in a manner never intended by the law. Active measures are taking to organize a brood of stock banks in the State of Iowa, under the general bank ing law recently adopted in that State. Of course, St. Louis and Chicago will be expected to take all that comes of that fresh flood of irredeemable money, aud turn it into gold and exchange. The Israelites that were compelled by their Egyptian task-masters to make bricks without straw, were not harder worked than are these two western cities to support the foreign speculators in State bonds, by converting their reams of \"lampblack and rags\" into actual cash. When will the people of the Mississippi Valley rouse up to the clear comprehension of the swindle that is practised upon them by the stock banks of the West ? Those banks never redeem their notes in gold or sil ver, except when they are \"wound up\" by the comptroller. They never furnish exchange at the points where it is wanted, and where their lying promises to pay are gathered, in the course of trade. The system of stock banking, without the Clearing House feature, is an enormous fraud, and a self-perpetuating evil, that will exhaust the West of its gold, and end in a vast expansion of paper money, and a ruinous revulsion before many years. Just consider the operation of these banks a moment : a set of speculators \u2014 most probably having their abode in Wall street, New York \u2014 to obtain $50,000 of State bonds. With this start they organize a bank, say ou Raccoon Creek, Wisconsin. They deposit the bonds with the State comptroller, who issues them a batch of bank notes thereon. These notes are sent to St. Louis and sold, as any like bundles of paper might be, at 1 per cent discount. Our brokers, bankers and merchants give countenance to this kind of"], [310, "22 EXCHANGE BUSINESS \u2014 DIFFERENCES OF EXCHANGE. money. They all say \" it's good, perfectly secure, etc., and we must take it, else we will injure the trade of the city.\" It is sold by the makers and issuers of It at 1 per cent discount for Missouri paper. The owners, through their St. Louis agents, present these Missouri notes to the banks and demand the specie. It is paid, and immediately shipped to New York, and invested in another batch of State bonds, which State bonds are made the basis of another new bank on Wildcat Creek, Iowa; and the notes of this new \" wildcat\" are in like manner sent to St. Louis and sold for Missouri paper, whereby more specie is drawn from the Missouri banks, and sent away to organize more such banks. Thus does the swindling proceed, and multiply itself without check or limit. The country is filled with worthless bank bills that are never redeemed. The specie is drawn from Missouri banks and shipped to New York to buy bonds ; and for every dollar so lost we get a paper dollar In return. And, intelligent (?) people, influential bankers see this living outrage on honest labour and legitimate banking going on, and stand heedless, as if paralyzed before the evil. The only safety, the only permanent relief, will be found in putting a check on the expansion of an Irre deemable paper currency in the Mississippi Valley. Let every bank note that circulates be forced to recog nize the specie basis in St. Louis and in Chicago. Then, if a merchant in St. Louis wants eastern exchange, and has $5,000 or $10,000 in Illinois or Wisconsin currency, he may go to the Clearing-House of such money, and get the gold or the exchange. He will not be compelled, as now, to sell his currency, lose a part of it by discount, get Missouri notes in return, and then demand and obtain gold from the Missouri banks. Although Great Britain cannot boast of \" wildcat\" bankers in name, it must be confessed that the events of the late commercial panic, has developed the fact that \" wildcats\" are to be found even among the banking fraternity of wealthy England, cautious Scotland, and impetuous Ireland ; a fraternity, by the way, which is popularly believed to exist somewhere in the region of the seventh heaven of honour, morality, and infallibility, but as recent events have proved, its members are only mortal after all, and who are as liable to err, morally as well as criminally, as the young and rising merchant, whose bills they may be desirous of discounting, so long as it answers the purpose of manager or directors, until he is cast off, and launched suddenly into the slaughter-house of some accountant, in whom the banker may be specially interested, or otherwise into the court of bankruptcy. The doings, however, of such wildcat banking establishments, have not the same facilities in Britain and Ireland, as they have in some districts of America, in so far aB the issue of notes is concerned, whilst the unlimited liability of shareholdership secures for the note holder, at some time or other, 20s. in the \u00a3, or 100 cents to the $. Upon the whole, therefore, it is only just to say, that whilst the banking system of America is as we have endeavoured to give samples of, it can boast of men in the profession of as high standing, not, perhaps, in means, but in integrity of purpose, and commercial financing abilities as what Great Britain can do, and her first-class bankers in such as New York, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, inherit the confidence of the public as much as any joint stock bank, or even the Bank of England itself, does in England, Scotland, or Ire land. EXCHANGE AND EXCHANGE OFFICES. This branch of the banking business is supposed to be a very speculative, and Bometimes a very money-making one, that depending upon the nature of the exchange business done, and the qualifications of the operator. Some bankers purchase the notes of \" broken banks,\" or banks which have suspended \u2014 and the affairs of which are still unsettled. They pay so much per dollar upon the bills or notes of such \u2014 and take their chance of getting more than they pay for them. Their knowledge of the position of all banks which are being \" wound up,\" and what prospect there is as to a dividend, enables them to speculate accordingly \u2014 pretty safely \u2014 and obtain a good margin. Again, sometimes a panic is raised about the stability of some one or more banks in certain districts ; the public who have the notes of such banks, getting to hear of it, become frightened, and go to these exchange bankers or brokers, who offer what they like for them ; the 3aid banker, in some cases, knowing perfectly well that the bank is all right, and thus pockets perhaps 25 per cent by the transaction. Such reports as to the standing of perfectly good banks, are sometimes got up by interested parties, to the great profit of the brokers, who buy up the notes from 5 to 25 per cent, discount, as the case may be. The whimsicalities of banking, and confidence in certain bank-notes, was curiously illus trated last July, when the brokers took into their heads to \" throw out\" the notes of nearly all the banks of the State of Wisconsin, whilst, at the same time, it was followed by an an nouncement from the railroad companies there, that the notes of these very banks would"], [311, "THE BANK NOTES OF AMERICA. 23 be taken at par, or full value. If there was no \" dodge\" somewhere in that, it certainly looked like it So far, therefore, as regards broken banks, and buying notes under value. The legitimate exchange business, however, consists more in the exchanging of the bank notes of one State for those of another State, or paying their value in gold or silver. Thus, for example, if a \u00a31 Scotch bank note is taken to London, (Eng.,) no London banker will take it as worth 20s stg., if he takes it at all. To get it converted into silver it must be taken to some silversmith or jeweller, who is in the habit of exchanging money of that sort, or to a \" bullion broker,\" whose business is that of exchanging the money of any foreign country for that of England, or vice versa. He is the English \"exchange banker or broker.\" On going to him with a Scotch one pound-note, he would give only 19s., or 19s. and &d. for it; thus charging 6c\u00a3 or Is. for \" exchange.\" Such is the prin ciple here, only that, sometimes, the notes of one State are more valuable 1000 miles from the place where issued, than the notes of those you wish to exchange them for, as we will endeavour to explain. Thus, for example, the notes of a firstclass New York bank are more valuable in Chicago, than the notes of a Chicago bank are there, because the bankers and merchants in Chicago can send, say a $5 New York note, to New York, and get credit for $5 in full ; but if they were to send a $5 Chicago bank note, the parties in New York receiving it would deduct, perhaps, 1-J per cent, or equal to 7-J cents, off that note, as Chicago notes in New York are not worth so much there, as New York notes are, although the Chicago note is good enough, and worth $5 in full in the State where issued. The difference, therefore, between the value of a $5 Chicago note in Chicago, and in New York, is 1\u00a3 per cent, or 7^ cents, on a $5 note. That difference is called the \" difference of exchange,\" or, that Chicago notes in the New York Market are 1-J per cent, below par, or full standard value. Thus, a $5 Chicago note is worth only $4.92^ \u2014 (four dollars and ninety-two and a half cents) in New York. As a general rule, we think we may say, that after a note of any State almost, except ing New York and the New England States, travels out of the State where it was issued, it loses in value the further it travels from home, as it were, (in the same way as the Scotch pound note does, when it goes to London,) and is subject to a deduction to a small extent, if you wish to convert it into gold or silver. As we h^ve said, this applies to almost all the notes of banks issued in every State, excepting those stated ; from the fact of New York being the centre where money is due, and having to be paid there, it is cheaper to pay with New York notes than any other, as we have already stated. In travelling, therefore\u2014 if you are a stranger\u2014 see that you are carrying no notes of one State into another State with you. The best money for you to take is gold\u2014 in 1, 2|, 3, 5, 10, and 20 dollar pieces. They will go anywhere for full value. All exchange offices are not always what they profess to be. In many places they par take of the character of gambling-houses, and Buch like. Respectable exchange offices, who can be trusted with business safely, are in every city and town, and are easily found out At many places, the sign of \" Exchange\" is put up, when it means a pawnbroker's shop, a drinking saloon, or where farm produce is bartered for dry goods, groceries, etc., so that this is one of the many things which takes time for a stranger to thoroughly understand and to discriminate between the different kinds of \" Exchange\" places of business there are, and pick out tbe \" wheat from the chaff.\" THE BANK NOTES OF AMERICA The bank notes\u2014 or bank bills, as they are called\u2014 both of the United States and Canada, are different, in many respects, to those of Great Britain. They have all one great and good feature about them, viz., they are all one size, and neither like the dumpy \u00a31 note of Scotland, the broad sheet of Ireland, nor yet like the \" promise to pay\" of Mr, Matthew Marshall, of the Bank of England. In one respect, however, they are like the \u00a31 notes of Scotland and Ireland\u2014 they are used till they become quite as filthy, greasy, dirty,"], [312, "24 BANK NOTES AND REPORTERS. ragged-looking remnants of better days. Like the Scotch and Irish banks, we presume, the American banks think it too much of a good thing to follow the example of the Bank of England, who, every time its notes come back to it, are never sent out again, although they were issued only the day before. They are not so prodigal with their paper, in that respect, as the \" old lady of Threadneedle street\" is ; besides, it might be sometimes rather inconvenient to be issuing fresh batches of notes, seeing that, for the most part, they end in amount where Bank of England notes begin, viz., \u00a35, or $20, and not only so, but the well-thumbed, \" all tattered and torn\" dollar note begets confidence in its very rags and length of service, and thus it goes, from hand to hand, till its flimsy form evaporates somewhere, or finds its way back, perchance, to be \" paid on demand,\" if it is in a condition capable of being read. The American bank note is about 3 inches deep, and 7 inches long, exquisitely engraved, with all the minuteness of the engraver's art, and signed and decorated with all the para phernalia attendant on such representatives of public confidence and wealth. They are issued from $1 upwards, running 2, 3, and 5, and from that to 10's, rising 5 each time. From $10, they rise to 20 and 50, by 10's, and from that to $100, and from that, by 100's, on to $500, and from that to $1000. They are made, generally, of thin, greyish-white coloured paper, with sometimes sundry glaring-coloured stamps, etc., upon them. None of them, when new, which we have seen, have the appearance of a new, snow-white Bank of England note, but resemble in appear ance the Scotch bank notes, when new, but the paper not half so thick or tough as they are. Tellers, in British and Irish banks, may judge of what the counting and sorting of notes, value 4s. each, must be, and the number of banks about 2000. We can fancy noth ing that could possibly ruffle the temper of some of the methodical gentlemen in the Bank of England, or the fast-looking gentlemen in some of the London private banks, so much as having only a couple of thousand pounds' worth, of a miscellaneous lot of American bank notes, to sort and pay out. If they thought the paying out of their bran-new 5 pounders a bore, we fancy they would perfectly revere the sight of them, ever afterwards. After all, however, as one gets accustomed to even the $1 notes, they are preferable for carrying, compared to a lot of gold or silver, in the pocket. As a means of distinguishing good notes from bad ones, publications called \" Bank Note Reporters\" are used, a few particulars regarding which we annex. BANK-NOTE REPORTERS. Amongst the literature of America, a perfect host of publications, all under one title, is issued, which, 60 far as we are aware, is almost unknown, and, we may also add, perfectly unnecessary in Great Britain and Ireland. The publications we refer to are small news paper-looking periodicals, termed \" Bank-Note Reporters,\" or, in a few cases, \" Bank-Note Lists.\" They are issued, generally, of about 32 pages of the imperial size, closely printed with very small type, and some giving wood-cut engravings of all the known coins in cir culation throughout the world, and their relative value. In every place of business, \u2014 whether it be at the office of the largest hotel, the largest wholesale or retail store, down to the old woman who retails out 3 cents' worth of sugar candy \u2014 the bank-note reporter is to be seen hung up at hand \u2014 in cities, towns, villages, and even in a solitary shanty in the woods, so be that any thing is sold there. Bank-note reporters are issued by the exchange bankers or brokers, and contain lists of every bank in the United States and Canada, and profess to give their read ers a correct idea of the position and standing of every bank, as well as all who have failed, been closed, or are at a low discount, and how much below par their notes are, if any \u2014 whether they are \"shin-plasters,\" or \"counterfeits,\" or \"imitations\" \u2014 what is the correct current value of \" broken banks,\" and all \" uncurrent money,\" and, in fact, every particular by which yon can tell a good note from a bad one, when it is pre sented, whether it be a $1, or a $500 note, or bill."], [313, "CURIOSITIES OF BANKING LITERATURE. 25 These publications are a public necessity, and the business of the country could not be carried on safely without them. Were they to go out of existence to-morrow, the whole country would, most likely, be flooded with counterfeits and imitations of the notes of banks in existence, as well as the notes of banks which had no existence, except on paper. In all the cities, these reporters are issued in large quantities, and as every exchange broker has one set of correspondents in other large cities, he gets the value of stocks cor rected by these correspondents in their various localities, and thus presents, probably, in the \" Reporter\" the prices of stocks in each of the leading cities, in addition to his quota tions respecting the character, and value of all bank-notes, in the city where he pub lishes his reporter. The reporters are published daily, tri- weekly, Bemi- weekly, and weekly, so as to suit all classes of purchasers\u2014 the old woman alluded to, probably, being content to carry on her business by getting \"posted up\" weekly, at a cost of 4 or 5 cents\u2014 whilst the larger operators wish to be \"posted\" daily, on the same subject It will at once be seen how necessary it is, that such publications should be conducted by men of undoubted integrity, and who ought to have no interest, other than in ren- dering their publications as trustworthy as the quotations of stocks is considered to be in a London or any other first-class newspaper. We have no doubt some of them arc con- ducted by men of high moral principle, who state the exact standing of every banking concern in the whole country, as they believe it to be, and that their opinions and quota- tions may be perfectly correct. Whilst we admit that freely, we have every reason to be- lieve, that bank-note reporters are issued, in some instances, from very different motives, and who do not state the facts as to the position of all banks, truthfully and fearlessly. In some cases it is well known, that unless a banking concern, will fee and bribe the publish- ers of certain bank-note reporters, they will quote the said banks lower than they ought to do, and by such means create a farna or prejudice against them, no doubt to some extent injurious to the banks thus assailed, by this species of black-mail, which is levelled against them. That is in the case of perfectly good banks. On the other hand, again, there is no doubt, that that class of reporter publishers are guilty of quoting \" wildcat\" banks at prices they are not entitled to, and by other means puffing the notes of such into circulation, on receiving a handsome douceur for their trouble. Such bank- note reporters are, of course, any thing but reliable ; the only difficulty is, how you are to tell one from another \u2014 seeing that they are all published by exchange brokers, who call themselves bankers. As we said before, there is no doubt, whatever, that there are respecta able ones amongst them \u2014 those guilty of such practices as alluded to being, we believe, the exception \u2014 yet it is only by a long residence in the town where they are published that you will be enabled to discriminate between the real and the doubtful of these safe-guards of the public pocket. The circulation of some of the most respectable of them, averages, it is said, 100,000 copies each publication. Presuming you want to know if a bank is good, you have only to refer to the alphabeti cal list of all banks published in the reporter \u2014 and if you do not find it amongst that list, you may conclude it is bad \u2014 or you may find it amongst the list of \" Broken Banks.\" The banks in every State are alphabetically arranged by themselves, so that there is no difficulty in finding out the name of the bank you want. Any one who has to do with money, and the receiving of it \u2014 in notes, to him \u2014 a bank-note reporter is indispensable. They abound in all large cities. CURIOSITIES OF BANKING LITERATURE. As we have no doubt there are many who are not aware of the existence of a few curi osities in banking literature, which are to be found in America, we think we will be con ferring, perhaps, some information, as well as amusement, if we give a few extracts from one of the \" Bank-Note Reporters,\" before alluded to. These public informants present a few features, we think, quite unknown by many of even the banking population of Great"], [314, "26 EXTRACTS FROM BANK-NOTE REPORTERS. Britain, as well as by the great mass of the people there, consequently, we annex a few ex tracts from one, as exhibiting illustrations of \" Wild-Cat\" banking, and the amount of in genuity there must be at work in the lithographing and engraving world, to produce the hosts of counterfeit or bogus notes there are in existence. The first sample we will present, is a piece of advice tendered to the Carroll County Bank, N. H., to see that its notes are better printed in future. Fancy one of the small publications of London talking to the Bank of Scotland, perhaps, in the following strain ! \" We would call the attention of the Legislature of New Hampshire to the miserably en graved issues of the Carroll County Bank, Sandwich. We have seen several of their is sues, and took particular notice of them. The bank ought to be indicted for getting out such abominably engraved notes, as the temptation to counterfeit them will be almost ir resistible.\" It is quite evident that the Bank-Note Reporter has the public welfare at heart in its magnanimous advice, as quoted. The next intimation is of a very gratifying nature, when it says, with regard to the State Bank of Indiana, that \" it is now demonstrated that the State of Indiana will realize about $2,000,000 clear profit, through its connection with this bank and the Sinking Fund.\" Talking of a certain bank in Litchfield, (the name of which we do not give,) the Re porter is again solicitous after the safety of the public, in talking very much as if it was hunting up a \" wild cat,\" when it says : \u2014 \" This institution has been under investigation for some time, and, to quote from a Con necticut journal, it is a \"sort of a fast and loose\" arrangement, which was \" of no use to any one but the owner ;\" and like a certain horse navigator,' who, once upon a time, took a ride on a Jersey road, and gave the steed too much headway ; the bank, like the horse, was too much to manage, and went its way accordingly.\" We next find an explanation of marks and letters which are inserted after the names of particular banks. Thus it says ; \u2014 \" The figures on the line with the bank expresses the discount on its notes. \" The descriptions under each bank are of counterfeits or alterations pn the bank. \" The letter (F) on the line with the bank shows it to be a free bank, with notes secured by a deposit.\" Where the letter (S) occurs, it is understood to mean that that particular bank is organ ized under the \" Safety Fund Bank Law,\" but, strange although it may appear, says: \u2014 \" These banks have no security deposited for the redemption of their notes.\" Other explanations follow, for example, showing the caution exhibited for the welfare of the public, yet not forgetting number one, in the last sentence : \u2014 \" The letter (It) means that we consider the bank doubtful. \" A dash ( \u2014 ), that it is unsaleable. \" An index ((USf\"), tbat we know too little of the bank to quote it \" A star (*), that the quotation is not reliable \u2014 doubtful whether we buy at all.\" We now give a few samples of how the counterfeits are noticed and described. Taking the case of the \"Farmers' Bank, Orwell, Vermont,\" it would appear that the genius of the counterfeiters nad been directed to impose upon the simple farmers in that State, of lovely scenery, in the following manner : \u2014 $1, vignette, farmer, sheaf of grain, rake, etc. ; female, shield, and figure 1 on right end. $2, vignette, farmer feeding hogs\u2014 altered from Farmers' Bank, Wickford, R. I. $2, spurious \u2014 vignette, cattle under tree. $2, figure 2 in the centre \u2014 female and eagle on the left \u2014 three females on the right $3, altered from broken Farmers' Bank, Wickford, R. L $3, vignette, men, boy, horses, sheep, house, etc. \u2014 female feeding chickens on right lower corner. $5 and $10, vignette, man lying on the ground, sheaf, rake, etc. \u2014 head on lower left corner, female on lower right \u2014 Orwell is spelled \" Orwidds.\" On the notes of the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank, in Burlington, Vt, again, the follow ing counterfeits are thus described : \u2014"], [315, "COUNTERFEITS, AND IMITATIONS OF BANK NOTES. 27 $3, $5, $10, $20, spurious \u2014 Washington on each end. $5, letter B \u2014 vignette figure 5 \u2014 men and horses on each Bide. $5, vignette, a female caressing an eagle. $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100, altered. $10, vignette, a female, sheaf of wheat, cattle, etc. $20, vignette, female with a spinning-wheel \u2014 an Indian on the right end \u2014 female and eagle on the left end. $50, vignette, figure of Hope\u2014 on the right end a stag\u2014 on the left, a female figure, with one foot on a globe. $100, Lafayette and Washington on the ends. It will thus be seen, that notwithstanding the ingenuity displayed in trying to dazzle the farmers and mechanics of Orwell and Burlington with the illustrations alluded to, the sharp eye of the \" reporter\" is upon them. Not content with trying their hand at such out-of-the-way places as quoted, some more daring spirits come into New York State, and crossing over from New York to Brooklyn\u2014 as it might be crossing from the city of Lon don to the Borough \u2014 there they make a dead set on the notes of the veritable \" Mechanics' Bank, Brooklyn,\" which has got its genuine notes secured by deposit of State stocks. The imitations on its notes are thus given : \u2014 $2, spurious \u2014 vignette, ship under sail, female on right. $3, vignette, blacksmith on right corner at work. $3, vignette, eagle and shield, Washington with 3 on each side. $5, agricultural implements, with female seated on a rock on the left of vignette. $5, altered \u2014 vignette, horse-shoeing. $5, altered \u2014 vignette, sailor at a wheel. Not daunted at that attempt, another is actually made upon the \" New York State Bank\" itself, of which the celebrated Rufus H. King is president. Thus : \u2014 $3, vignette, State Arms, portrait between signatures. $5, Indian on right end. $5, spurious \u2014 vignette, four females supporting a \"5,\" $5, spurious \u2014 vignette, images swinging in a wreath. $5, Massachusetts' coat of arms on the right side, \" New\" in New York is spelt \" Now.'' $10, $20, $50, altered \u2014 vignette, female, eagle, ship. We could fill a good-sized volume with such descriptions, and as our last, we will give another, as showing that even in Her Majesty's dominions, a leaf or two is desired out of the books of issue, and taken without the liberty of the best banks in Canada. Whether the counterfeits are of American or Canadian manufacture, we are not suffi ciently \" posted\" to say. Who would have thought of the good old-fashioned, cautious Scotch banker, Mr. David son, being attempted to be imposed upon in this manner, with such imitations as the follow ing, on the \" Bank of Montreal.\" Thus we quote : \u2014 Genuine notes of this bank, it is said, are in circulation, with counterfeit signature. Be careful. $5, steamer on upper right corner; cattle on left; 5 in centre; an eagle between signatures. $6, Toronto Branch, letter A, pay Baker; the word \" value\" to left of \"Toronto,\" in genuine it is over \" Toronto ;\" in counterfeit, nose of small dog comes near \" T\" in \" To ronto,\" in genuine it is an eighth of an inch from the \" T.\" $5, Montreal Bank \u2014 pay cash or bearer; others pay L. Carlle, in Quebec, April 2, 1819, and pay W. Radenhaun. $5, altered \u2014 vignette, farmer reclining on 5 ; others V in circle at bottom. $10, lithograph \u2014 they are numbered 19,047. $10, altered from $1. $10. parliament is spelled parKment $10, photograph on the Petersborough Branch. We fancy we see a genuine smile come over the grave face of the manager, when he saw the \" nose of small dog\" coming into too close proximity with one of his head agencies, and the other dodges to deceive him and his \" cute\" tellers. Having thus given a few samples of the counterfeit notes in circulation, we will now con-"], [316, "BROKEN BANKS \u2014 USURY LAWS. 28 elude our extracts of these gems of banking literature, with an illustration or two of how the character or death of some of the \" institutions\" are thus so ruthlessly recorded, with- out the least regard for the feelings of the living, or the friends of departed heroes of banking renown. Thus a few of the Canada banks is recorded ; \u2014 City of Hamilton, (shinplaster,) Hamilton no sale. Colonial Bank of Chatham, U. C \u2014 Commercial Bank, Brockville closed. Commercial Bank, Fort Erie closed. Mechanics' Bank, Montreal fraud. Merchants' Bank, Toronto fraud. National Bank, Montreal fraud. Niagara Suspension Bridge Co failed. Ottawa Bank, Ottawa failed People's Bank of Toronto closed. Crossing the St Lawrence, we find in the United States, the following, out of hundreds, as showing there that \" shinplaster_\" won't go down at any price, no more than they will in Canada : \u2014 Commonwe__lth Bank closed. Commercial Bank closed. Etna Iron Furnace, (shinplaster,) no sale. Atlantic Bank, May's Landing closed. Atlantic Bank, Cape May, C. H , . closed. Bank of America, Cape May closed. Bank of Cape May Co., Cape Island, Cape May Co. That the counterfeits on some banks are numerous, may be inferred from the fact, that on the \" State Bank of Ohio,\" alone, we count no less than 33 different descriptions of coun- terfeit notes on it. When a new bank is started, it is laconically announced, for example, thus: \u2014 \" The Manufacturers' Bank, at Elizabethport, N. J., has just commenced business, with N. P. Saris, as president, and James Wilson, as cashier.\" \"The directors of the Fayette County Bank, at Uniontown, Pa., met and organized on Monday last. Alfred Patterson, Esq., was elected president of the bank, and William Wilson, Esq., cashier.\" We advise all who have 5 cents to invest, to get a \" bank-note reporter.\" It may not be long before it proves its worth, to be equal to its weight in gold. THE USURY LAWS. As one of the peculiarities connected with American finance, we append a list, showing the rates per cent, which can be legally claimed for the loan of money in the respective States, and the penalties incurred for exacting more than is legal. It will be seen that the \" crime\" of usury has a wide margin, ranging, in most cases, from 6 to _0 per cent In the State of Minnesota, we believe it is 15 per cent The penalties, however, attached to charging a higher rate of interest, act as a dead letter, it being well known, to use a common saying in this country, \" It is an easy matter to whip the devil round the post,\" or, in other words, evade the law, by various modes. Nothing is easier, by those who are so disposed. It is now four years ago (5th Aug., 1854) since the usury laws of England were repealel, and from the tone of some influential journalists in America, we shall be surprised, if such absurd and powerless laws should be much longer deferred in being repealed there also.

The Territories are not subject to any usury laws. The State of Pennsylvania has been the first to pronounce in favour of free trade in money mat ters in this respect. Some European readers may be reminded, that the difference of rates in the States, is owing to the fact that each State frames its own laws, and what may be justice according to law, in one State, may not be considered so in some of the other States in the Union. In Canada the legal interest has been at the rate of 6 per cent, but by a law, passed last session, individuals may exact any rate of interest which may be agreed upon between them. Banks, however, are prohibited from exacting a higher rate of discount than 7 per cent, and are prohibited from paying interest upon deposits. COMMERCIAL COLLEGES. As we have stated elsewhere, the commercial education of the Americans is in general far more varied and more generally useful than that enjoyed by young men in commercial circles in Great Britain. The education there terminates too frequently with a boy obtain ing at school a slight knowledge of book-keeping and accounts, so that by the time he goes abroad into the world, he knows about as much respecting such matters, as if he had never heard of a day-book, bill-book, or ledger. Until some years ago, the same state of things existed in America, until institu tions of an exclusively commercial charactei were established, called \"Commercial Col leges.\" Such establishments are carried on by teachers on their own account, in a great many of the large cities in the United States, but not in Canada, so far as we are aware. Such an institution generally consists of one or more immense large rooms or halls, hung round with blackboards, diagrams, and superb specimens of caligraphy, and filled with a large supply of tables and chairs. Students attend there, varying from 15 to nearly 50 years of age. The students sit apart from each other, so that one student is not aware as to the state of proficiency of the one nearest to him. Scholars of all ages are to be seen listening to the teacher from"], [318, "30 COMMERCIAL COLLEGES \u2014 AUCTION ROOMS. the black-board \u2014 working out their accounts\u2014 or, perhaps, trying to improve their handwriting. In this way, the man of 30 years of age, who finds his commercial edu cation in some respects deficient, is taught in such a way as not to display his ignorance of such matters to the young lad of 15 or 16. The course of instruction is so arranged, that students can enter and commence their studies at any time, and receive from the instruc tions of the teacher the advantages of a class, all commencing at one time. There is no special attendance insisted upon, but the system is so worked, that every student \u2014 young and old \u2014 at once feels it to be his interest to attend regularly and work diligently, as, until he reaches a given point of perfection, he is refused the diploma of efficiency, which is given only to those who attain the standard fixed upon by the proprietor of the college, the particulars of which every student is made aware of We had the pleasure of seeing one of these institutions in full operation at Cincinnati ( where they are carried on most efficiently), and were very much pleased with the method pursued, and forcibly impressed with the value which such an education must prove, in advancing young men in commercial positions afterwards, as well as enabling them to take situations in a counting-house or office of whatever description. They are taught not only the every-day affair, of how to keep books by single and double entry, make out accounts, calculate interest, draw bills, understand commission business \u2014 and the whole by a regular system of books throughout \u2014 but the information conveyed extends to insu rance, railroad business, shipping, manufacturing, and banking operations. On particular days each week, lectures are delivered to the whole school en masse, by one of *he pro fessors, on certain commercial subjects. We had the pleasure of attending one of these lectures (by Mr. R. M. Bartlett, of Cincinnati,) and were highly gratified by the lucid explana tions he gave of banking operations \u2014 how conducted \u2014 the nature of such as the deposit ledger, discount-ledger, and the various other books used in banks, and the relation each assistant has to particular books \u2014 all conveyed in such language that the dullest student could comprehend it. The system, altogether, of commercial colleges, is an excellent one, and must tend great ly to the advancement of the students who attend them. So much are they now in use, and so highly valued, that one of the best credentials a young man can produce of his com mercial ability, is to present his diploma from a well-known commercial college. The requirements at some colleges are greater than others, and hence the difference in the accomplishments of their members, as well as in the standing of different colleges. The periods to which the course of instruction extends, depends entirely upon the stu dent himself. Some will finish in 8 or 10 weeks \u2014 others, again, will take double that length of time ; and in neither case do they get their diploma till they have reached the standard of proficiency fixed upon. In the western cities, many who attend such colleges are the sons of farmers, who, not having had the advantages of acquiring information on such matters at the public schools, repair to these colleges to complete their commercial education, so as to fit them for com mencing in their first situation ; others, again, as we have said, much older in years, attend these colleges, to perfect themselves in branches they found themselves deficient in. One of the peculiarities of the colleges referred to, is, in summer weather, to find every student, with scarcely an exception, studying without coat or jacket \u2014 one and all being in their shirt sleeves \u2014 on account of the great heat. AUCTION ROOMS AND AUCTIONEERS. The auction rooms in America \u2014 such as in New York, for example \u2014 are carried on in a style, and an amount of bond fide business transacted in them, which strangers to this coun try have little idea of. Goods are exported from Britain and the continent of Europe to be sold in the auction room, and also imported by many houses here, who take advantage of it as their regular and only means of disposing of their imports, whilst others again, who have over-"], [319, "TRADE SALES \u2014 AN AUCTION ROOM IN NEW YORK. 31 imported, or with a bad prospect before them, or a lot of old stock on hand, throw them into the auction room to be sold for what they will bring, during the terms of the \" Spring\" and \" Fall\" seasons' trade. The best wholesale and retail houses in New York, and in all parts, buy at these sales. There are auction rooms for dry goods, others for books and stationery, others for hardware, and so on. Each auction room is filled with merchants or storekeepers interested in the respective classes of goods to be sold. Thus, at a \" Trade as it is called, of books, for example, you will find books sent there by publishers in London, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. The catalogues specify whose books they are, state publishing price, and how many copies there are of each particular book. At a book trade 6ale, all the leading booksellers in the country are drawn together, and there men meet who have not seen each other for 6 months or more, and sometimes ac quaintanceships are renewed or formed for mutual pleasure and advantage. To give an idea of the extent of business done at these sales, we may mention, that at the trade sale in September last, in New York, books were sold to the amount of no less than about $400,000, or \u00a380,000, stg., out of 145 invoices. The largest amount sent in by one house being $20,000, or \u00a34000 stg. The sale occupied 11 days, from 8, A. H., to 10, p. m., showing an average amount of about \u00a37272 worth of books sold every day The catalogue of all the works sent in for sale is ready, and in the hands of the trade, about a month previously. The largest number of copies of any one book sold, was 4000 copies. At that sale an offer was made and refused for 200,000 copies of a particular spelling-book, at one-eighth of a cent less than the regular price. Immense quantities of stationery are also sold at these sales. In no other congregation of individuals will be found such a heterogeneous mass of men from all parts of America, and belonging to all countries as is to be seen in the auction room. It has been often said that no place equals New York for its numerous specimens of such. If that be true, we should say that no opportunity for seeing such, is equal to that, when all are collected together in a dry goods auction sale-room, and all bent on the same object. About 11 o'clock in the forenoon, any day during the season of a sailor summer trade, }'ou will find an auction room in \" full blast,\" with the cry of the nervous auctioneer as he chatters on the everlasting ditty of buy, buy, buy \u2014 up, up, up, up \u2014 in one incessant stream, until he is about gasping out his last breath. Around him, with memorandum-book in left, and pencil in right-hand, checking off the lots as they \" go\" and are \" gone,\" you will find the New York wholesale storekeeper alongside of those from all parts, extending from Montreal, in Canada, to New Orleans, Louisiana, or from Massachusetts in the east, to Mis- souri and Chicago in the west \u2014 aye, even as far as the shores of the Pacific. There, all pitted against each other, you will find the business-like Englishman alongside of the high- blooded Mexican trader, the cautious Scotchmen making a bid after the volatile French- man ; the quiet down-east Yankee alongside of the phlegmatic German ; the quick-tem- pered French Canadian beside the little wide-awake Jew, whilst Pat, honest fellow, assists to put away the lots as they are knocked down. There, between the cupidity of some, jealousy or ignorance of others, the auctioneer rests his hopes to realize a good price for his employer, the importer. There, day after day, the same scene is to be seen ; the same play being performed, and during the process, thousands of dollars' worth of goods changing hands and getting spread all over this mighty continent. The great factotum of the auction room, however, is the auctioneer. Upon him all eyes are fastened. There he mounts the counter, encircled amid a bower of silks, satins, la ces, and ribbons, all hanging around him, suspended from the iron rods above, on which the goods are placed as they are knocked down. There he stands, with pencil and book in band \u2014 in shirt sleeves \u2014 without collar and handkerchief, so as to have free scope for his vocal powers, in his everlasting prattle. You need not suppose that he is gifted with much eloquence, or that he is a fit represent ation of the departed George Robins, of Covent Garden renown, in his descriptive powers; or expect to hear that eternal \" going,\" \" once,\" \" twice,\" \" thrice,\" and waiting for a bid, in order to assist off the goods under review, and ending up with \" going,\" and \"gone.\""], [320, "32 THE AUCTIONEER \u2014 TRADE WITH CANADA. However great the volubility of the American auctioneer, it is not spent on any such super fluities, or upon either ornamentation or praise of the articles submitted, bnt confined to one everlasting, breathing, gasping ditty on that almighty subject \u2014 dollars and cents \u2014 and with only one soliloquy \u2014 and that, one incessant, seathing, soaring up and down cry from E flat to double bass, of up, up, up, up, up, up \u2014 and buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy. That is his Alpha and Omega \u2014 uttered with all the declamatory powers of a Demos thenes \u2014 down to the quietest whisper, as he is about to stop, out of breath, to take in another supply of air, to fill his exhausted lungs \u2014 when he starts afresh again, with all his usual vigour, till he knocks down one article, and commences on another in the same breath. He has no time to descant upon the qualities of the black gros, hung up before you. He passes no opinion as to its being either good, bad, or indifferent; whether the moire antique there, has a cotton back or a silk one ; there it is ; judge for yourself; bid if you like, or be silent, it is all the Bame to him : his course is onward with his everlasting cry of buy, buy, buy, buy \u2014 and up, up, up, and upwards with the price, when he fancies he has got even the sixteenth part of a move of the head towards a bid. The New York auctioneer is one of those unique characters only to be met with in this coun try, and a phase of business may be seen by the stranger, in a New York auction room, never seen before. The same remarks apply to auction rooms in Philadelphia and such cities. Talk of your crack auctioneers, either at the Mart, Dabenham and Storrs, and all such well-known places of resort I The British auctioneer-is he wishes to increase his vocal powers, in volubility\u2014 must come to this side of the Atlantic, and go under training in a wholesale dry goods auction room. We will warrant he will return, only to make Charles Matthews jealous, as a rival, in \" Patter versus Clatter.\" In the \" Peter Funk\" retail auction room in New York, again, the same genus homo is to be seen and heard, in shirt Eleeves, long flowing beard, with his clear, ringing voice, trying to get up the steam before his confreres, and between them, by their mock-auction dodges, trying to decoy such as you into their trap \u2014 there, to have an opportunity of \" selling\" yourself, along with a watch of best Birmingham gold-plated make, for eighteen carat gold. The man who goes there without any thing valuable about him, and with a sharp look-out, may even be amused with that specimen of an auctioneer, and auction room. Such places exist in all large towns in Great Britain, where \"Peter Funk\" frequently performs with considerable profit. Here, however, he appears to us to be more advanced in his education, and with vocal powers which would at once take the breath forever from his friend in the Poultry of London, or Trongate of Glasgow. THE TRADE WITH CANADA FROM THE UNITED STATES. That the trade from the United States to Canada is rapidly increasing, whilst that from Great Britain is on the decline, may be seen from the following abstract from tables which we give, drawn up by the Canadian government on the subject, which shows the extent and progress of the trade between Canada and the United States. In 1853 the total imports into Canada from all sources amounted to $31,981,436 Of which was imported \u2014 From Great Britain, $18,489,120; from United States, $11,782,144. The balance of imports were taken from other foreign ports. In 1854 the total imports into Canada amounted to 40,529,324 Of which was imported \u2014 From Great Britain, $22,963,323 ; from United States, $15,333,096. Balance of imports were from foreign ports. In 1855 the total imports into Canada amounted to 36,086,168 Of which was imported \u2014 From Great Britain, $13,303,460 ; from United States, $20,828,676. Balance of imports were from foreign ports. For the year past, ending Dec. 31, 1856, the total value of imports into Canada was. . 43,584,384 Of which was imported \u2014 From Great Britain, $18,212,932 ; from United States, $22,704,508. From this statement it will be seen that a steady increase in the imports from the United States has continued as far back as 1853."], [321, "33 TRADE WITH CANADA. BAKERIES. For the vear 1853 the total amount of imports from Great Britain amounted to $18,489,120 For the year 1856 18,212,933 Showing a falling off between the two periods above mentioned of 2,761,188 Referring to the imports for 1853 from the United States, they amount to 11,782,144 For the year 1856 22,704,508 Showing an increase between these two periods, in savour of United States, of 10,922,364 Thus it will be seen that while the importation of goods from Great Britain into Canada has considerably diminished, the trade from the United States has increased enormously. The exports from Canada also keep pace with the imports, as will be seen by the following : \u2014 In 1853 the total exports amounted to 23,801,300 Of which were sent to Great Britain, 11,465,404 ; and to the United States, 8,936,380.

Such is the title given to wholesale bread manufactories, where the greater portion of the work is performed by machinery. As a most decided improvement upon the old system of men baking with their hands, and tramping the dough with their bare feet\u2014 not, per haps, at all times so clean as they ought to be\u2014 has induced us to notice one of those establishments which we saw in operation whilst at Cincinnati. We may observe that Mechanical Bakeries are established in several of the large cities, and, although they may not in some cases, as yet, have succeeded in turning out such great quantities of bread as their projectors anticipated, yet, we feel satisfied, they will extend, not only in increase of business of those already started, but that every large city will, in the course of time, have"], [322, "34 BAKING BY STEAM \u2014 THE AUTOMATON OVEN. them in operation, from which the public will be supplied with pure, wholesome, and un adulterated bread, made of the best materials, and in the most unexceptionable manner. The establishment at Cincinnati we may take to be a model one of its kind. It was started last July by, we believe, a company of four gentlemen, viz. : two shrewd Americans, with two \" canny\" Scotchmen for partners, one of the latter being the practical manager. They have erected a handsome, square-built, brick building, more like a Manchester ware house than a baking establishment. The ground floor is chiefly taken up with the sales department, where bread is kept in large \" bins\" and drawers, and 6old retail as well as wholesale. Up stairs there are three floors. On the highest floor is where the stock of flour and other ingredients for mixing are kept. After the ingredients are all mixed, they are emptied into the baking, or, rather, kneading-machine, which, revolving slowly, with its internal simple machinery, kneads the bread most completely. This machine is capable of kneading ten barrels of flour in twenty minutes. After it is thus made into dough, ready for being baked into loaves, it is allowed to fall out at an opening at the bottom of the machine, in quantities as wanted, into troughs, and from there taken to the floor below, where the dough is cut into quantities of two or four pounds each, weighed off, and formed into the shape of loaves, as wanted. During the whole of this process, the dough is only handled by the bakers when giving the small pieces a roll round and placing them in the loaf-pans, ready for the oven. Thus far, then, a great saving of labour is effected, and the dough not once touched by hands or feet in the whole process of kneading, and only touched when shaping it into loaves, as we have stated. In the oven department there is not so great a saving of labour to be effected compara tively with the kneading process, from the fact of there not being much labour required about ovens, further than merely putting in and drawing out the \" batch,\" when ready. But that even, in the Mechanical Bakery, is done by machinery. After the bread is moulded into shape, and put into pans, they are placed on iron trays, each containing about thirty loaves. The tray is then placed on a carriage in front of the oven door, when, at a given signal, the door is drawn up, the tray, with its load, is carried into the inside of the oven on the carriage, and the door falls down gently \u2014 the whole done as if by magic. Regarding the oven \u2014 which is correctly named the Automaton Oven \u2014 we append the following de scription of it and its working, as supplied to us by the superintendent of the establishment: \" The oven is upright, it has its foundation and heating furnaces in the basement, and its doors in the first and second stories. The dough is put into, and the bread discharged from them on both these floors when in full operation. The baking-cars, loaded on the first floor, ascend through the oven, and discharge the baked bread on the second floor, and the cars loaded on the second floor, descend and discharge on the first floor. The oven contains twenty-six cars, thirteen of which are ascending and thirteen descending at the same time. Each car passes through the oven in thirty minutes, when baking common-sized loaves ; but the speed is regulated by the size of the loaf and the time required for baking. The capacity of one \" baking car\" is sixty loaves, weighing about a pound and a half each. The temperature of the oven is uniform, and is maintained at any degree of heat necessary, by dampers. Thermometers in the oven indicate the temperature to the attend ants. The loaves are all baked precisely alike, and never either burned or under-done. The temperature for baking in the automatic oven is more than two hundred degrees higher than can be used in the common baker's oven, without burning the bread to a cin der ; because the hot air in a chamber without draft is strong and penetrating, and not raw and scorching like the heat in an ordinary oven, where the fire is in the oven itself, and acts directly on the bread while baking, besides exposing it to the impurities of dust, smoke, etc. The oven being upright, with the car loads of bread in it, one above another, and having no draft through it, all the alcoholic vapor arising from the fermented dough is condensed on and absorbed by the cold dough, whereby the bread is improved in flavor, and its nourishing properties sensibly increased. The machinery which produces the automatic movements of the cars, is placed on the back of the oven, and may be seen best on the second floor.\""], [323, "35 MECHANICAL BAKERIES. WHO ARE YANKEES. Altogether it is a most mysterious-looking operation, and from the fact of no one handling or assisting the bread into the oven, or out of it, opening and shutting the oven doors, and travelling of the carriages \u2014 all moving as if by clock-work, and yet doing that perfectly by machinery which is not always done so by human hands \u2014 we think it well deserves the name of the \" Automaton Oven.\" When in \" full blast,\" the bakery can bake no less than 250 barrels of flour per day into bread. At our visit, the establi-liment had just newly started, but, even then, was doing a large business, their bread being sold in shops in different parts of the city. With highly commendable straightforwardness, the company invite the public to call and see the whole operation \u2014 the quality of flour, which is the best \u2014 and all other ingredients, so that they may have every confidence in what is supplied. One part of the arrangement, we understood, was not complete when we were there, viz. : that of cutting and weighing off the quantity of dough for each loaf. It was then done by hand and a pair of scales, but we understand that it will be, (if not by this time,) cut off and weighed by machinery also, so that mathematical precision in weight will be obtained, and greater speed in pre paring the dough for the pans. Every description of bread is made, from \" crackers\" to large loaves. An inspection of the rules of the establishment, as to chewing tobacco, drinking, and cleanliness, show that the proprietors are up to, if not a little a-head of, the times. We observe that their price for a 28 oz. loaf is 5 cents, or about 2-^c/. (stg.), for CasJi, for which only they deal. WHO ARE YANKEES? Many, we think, use the word Yankee, without knowing its exact meaning, whilst others apply it with reference to the whole American people, when they designate them, \" Yan kees.\" According to the last American authority, Webster, the meaning of the word Yankee stands thus : \" A corrupt pronunciation of the word English by the native Indians of Ame rica.\" From the fact that the English first landed in New England, the word Yankee thus be came applicable to them, and it still retains, to this day, its significance as a term applica ble to all who belong to the New England States, and to them only. To apply the name of Yankee to all Americans, wherever situated, is an error. Just as well may the High lander of Scotland, be considered a \" cockney,\" or a \" John Bull,\" as to suppose an inhabit ant, of the Northern States of America, to be a \" Yankee.\" It is the New Englanders, alone, who are considered Yankees \u2014 although the term, altogether, is one of a convention al nature, and very often applied to any thing supposed to be of very speculative, doubt ful, or dodging character."], [324, "WATER AND WATER DRINKING \u2014 DRINKING CUSTOMS, 36 WATER AND WATER DRINKING. We have never, as yet, met in this country with an ins^nce, such as we once met with in Manchester, (Eng.,) where the children of a family had never tasted water from the time they were born, always being supplied with \"beer,\" when thirsty\u2014 a practice, we fear, far too common in families in the manufacturing districts. From all we have seen at public, as well as private tables here, pure water seems to be almost the only beverage\u2014 first thing in the morning and the last at night, and, alto gether, are inclined to believe the Americans to be the greatest water-drinkers in the world. At breakfast, a tumbler of water is placed alongside of your cup and saucer \u2014 at dinner time, it is there \u2014 at tea, or supper, again it appears. Many we have seen at the tables of the large hotels who take neither tea nor coffee \u2014 but water only \u2014 along with their eatables. These are, of course, exceptions \u2014 still we have been surprised to meet with so many who do so. Some, again, take cold water and milk, mixed, instead of either tea or coffee. Whether it is the nature of the climate, the heat of summer, and consequent perspira tion, we know not ; but the consumption of water for drinking purposes, is certainly enor mous. In a counting-house, it would be thought as great a want to have no pens and ink to write with, as to have no cistern full of water, and a tumbler, in a handy corner for the day's consumption. Workshops are similarly supplied. The quality of the water consumed differs in different localities. In New York, no bet ter water could be desired than is obtained from the reservoir at the Croton works. In other cities, on the sea-board, it is also generally good, and all spring water. Proceeding West, to the Ohio district, it is also good in many parts. At Cincinnati, how ever, for instance, the water used there is that from the Ohio River, and is frequently almost unfit to drink \u2014 unfiltered ; but when filtered, and cooled with ice, is very good. Passing farther West to the Mississippi, again, there the water is of very doubtful quality, as well as purity. So much is that the case, that strangers are advised to be careful in par taking of it. So powerful is it, in its effects, that we question if the most staunch tee-to taller would not, for health's sake, be inclined to partake of the light \" lager beer\" of the Germans, than run the risk of quaffing out of the \" Father of Waters.\" All up and down the Mississippi it is the same. Of course, where spring wells are stationed in towns, the water is, in general, excellent ; and there is scarcely a farmer, or resident in the country, but who has a spring well at his door, and who can easily supply himself with pure aqua. The tax for water, is, generally, paid by the landlord, and included in his estimate of rent The consumption of water, in summer, for watering the streets, either to lay the dust, or cool the ground in front of the houses, is also very great ; and a system of watering in that respect \u2014 by means of hose, attached to the mains \u2014 is carried out, to an extent un known in Britain. For hours men are employed every day, at different intervals, to keep a continuous stream of water playing upon the ground in front of houses and stores, for the purpose stated. That is in addition to water-carts, perambulating the streets, watering them as they go along. In some cities, certain hours are fixed, after which no water is allowed to be used in the manner described. DRINKING CUSTOMS. In the above remarks, we have endeavoured to make clear, that the greatest drinking cus tom in America, is in the consumption of cold water. It must not be supposed, however, that no malt or spirituous liquors are consumed. As a whole, we should say, that although a large amount of both must be consumed in this country, both from what is manufactured and what is imported, still the average consumption per man is a trifle compared with the"], [325, "THE DRINKING CUSTOMS OF AMERICA. 37 average amount consumed, in either England, Scotland, or Ireland. The drinking cus toms, for the most part, are confined to drinking whilst Btanding at the bars of the hotels and drinking-saloons \u2014 Brother Jonathan performing that operation decidedly fast. As a general rule, there is none of that sitting down to brandy and water, or \" punch\" and pipes, on an afternoon after dinner, or in the evening, which is to be seen in the snuggeries in London, nor yet those jollifications over whisky-toddy, which are too common in Scot land, or over the grog or \" potheen\" in Ireland. Nothing of the sort. After dinner, Jona than goes off to have a 6moke and a read of the newspaper, and thence to business, with out, as a general rule, tasting one drop of liquor. He has neither the time nor the inclina tion for it. After business hours at night, there is not that amount of frequenting \" howfs\" or pet houses, which is common, amongst young men in business, in ihe large cities and towns in Great Briaitn. They live, most probably, a good way off, and are glad to get home as soon as possible. If they board at a hotel, they prefer the billiard-room to the drinking saloon. As we have said before, the Americans prefer to drink at the bar, standing. They order what they want, swallow it at one breath, and off they go. The greatest cause which we can assign for the undoubted temperance of the Ameri can people, as a whole, consists in the detestation with which they look upon drunkenness as a vice, and the care they exercise against indulging in it, from prudential motives. Employers are more particular, probably, about the sober habits and 6teady conduct of an assistant than any other qualification \u2014 for what they term his being a \" reliable man.\" If there is one thing more than another, which will make them doubt a man's capability to serve them faithfully, it is his inebriety of character, well knowing as they do, with drink being so cheap here, that if a man gets to use it frequently, and begins to like it, he is going fast on the high road to destruction. Brought up with such ideas and habits themselves, and taught to look at the drinking customs with something like fear and trembling, and knowing how much a man's value consists in his being a strictly sober man, they are particularly careful in the selection and conduct of the assistants they employ, to see that they are of sober habits, and that they remain so. Men lose situations here, from no other cause than being known to frequent the bar, or a drinking-saloon, too often, although they may be steady enough at their busi ness. There is no doubt, after all, that there is, probably, far too much drink consumed in this country, particularly in sea-port cities, where sea-faring men come in contact with the commercial classes, and also about the drinking-saloons of the hotels, when salesmen or merchants meet their country customers there. As we have said elsewhere, lager beer, a light description of home-brewed beer, is the great beverage of the German population, and there is not a town or village but what has its \" lager beer saloon.\" The Germans sit down at tables, and converse and smoke over their beer, consuming often large quantities before they rise. It is, however, compara tively speaking, harmless, when compared with the villanous \" fire water,\" which is dis tilled, in the shape of whisky, from Indian corn, rye, etc., and sold at a mere trifle per pint. Wholesale price, 35 cents (or Is. Sd. stg.) per gallon. Drink is not sold at the bar at so much per measure \u2014 but the bottle is placed for you to help yourself \u2014 into a tumbler \u2014 unless you wish any of the fancy drinks, such a3 \" gin sling,\" \" brandy smash,\" \" whisky skin,\" etc., etc. In that case, they are mixed up ready for you, and charged accordingly. As connected with the use of non-intoxicating liquors by the American people, we may mentiou as a fact \u2014 differing so much as it does from the customs in Great Britain, where beer, ale, \"stout,\" or wine form almost indispensable adjuncts of the dinner table \u2014 that, in America, nothing of that sort is ever to be seen, almost, at the dinner tables in private houseB \u2014 but tea or coffee (generally tea) takes the place of malt or spirituous"], [326, "38 REFRESHING DRINKS \u2014 THE ICE TRADE. liquors ; and a cup of tea is handed round the table to each guest, just as he would be as sisted to a glass of ale or wine. To the stranger, from Britain, this seems somewhat pecu liar, yet, after all, it or water is the more rational beverage,and certainly not likely to lead to such consequences as follow sometimes from the appearance of the \" bottle,\" on the family table. REFRESHING DRINKS IN HOT WEATHER. The stranger, in passing through any of the large cities in the United States, will find the stores of the chemists crowded with parties, who, thirsty from heat and perspiration, fly to such places to quaff the delieiously cool beverages which are there supplied, at from S to 5 cents per glass. These consist of a mixture of soda water and a variety of native wines or unintoxicating cordials, either of which, mixed with 6oda water, makes a cool, efferves cing, and refreshing drink. It is surprising to see the number of ladies and gentlemen, and, in fact, all classes, who stand round the handsome marble fountains which are fitted up in such places, getting a tumbler thus filled up, drinking the contents at once, paying their 3 or 5 cents, and departing. The consumption of such beverages is enormous, one lad in each chemist's store attending to the fountain alone. The soda water is kept in large vessels underneath the counter, from which it is led up to the fountain and there supplied through a silver tap into the tumbler containing the cordial to be mixed with it. THE ICE TRADE. One of the many things which strikes the stranger from Great Britain, on his visiting this country for the first time, is the traffic which is carried on during the summer months in the article of ice \u2014 one as necessary in summer, as the fuel for fire is in winter. The trade is carried on by private individuals as well as by public companies. In every city and town, without exception, you will see the ice cart perambulating the streets in a similar manner to what the coal carts do whilst dispensing that article in small quantities to the poorer classes in the cities and towns of Britain. In the cities of the seaboard, the ice trade is carried on \" wholesale, retail, and for ex portation.\" Some are engaged in the \" shipping business\" exclusively, sending ship-loads of it to the West Indies and other tropical climates, where it is, no doubt, duly appreciated. In the cities, the carts go round with immense blocks, about 12 to 20 inches thick, and about from 22 to 27 inches in length and breadth. The carts have canvas covers over them to protect the ice from the 6un as far as possible, but still it continues gradually to vanish, notwithstanding. It is beautifully clear, and on a scorching hot day makes one al most feel cool to look at it Every morning, the men in charge of its delivery, visit their customers as regularly as the baker does with bread, and, carrying up a loaf of ice, deposits it at the outside of the door. The difficulty of handling the ice is got over by the use of a huge pair of calipers, which stick into the block on each side, and thus, lifted by a chain attached to them, it is carried up or down stairs. Thus deposited at the door of the customer, it is left there at his risk, and if he does not look after it soon, may shortly afterwards find that it has gone into its original element, and run off. We may safely say, there is not a private family almost, not a counting-house, store, bank, or any place of business whatever, but what has its de livery of ice every morning, and put into the small cistern of water, which is placed in a cool corner of the premises, to supply the inmates for the day. The common supply for counting-houses and families is a piece about 20 inches square, for which they pay 10 cents (or od.). Only those who know what a hot summer day is, in such as New York, can fully appreciate the luxury of a tumbler of iced water. In the drinking saloons it is used in every sort of liquor, both malt and spirituous. In winter it is cut out in large squares from the frozen rivers and lakes, preserved well"], [327, "39 CUTTING OUT THE ICE \u2014 ICE-HOUSE AT ROCKLAND LAKE. covered up in ice houses, on the banks of rivers generally, for the convenience of transport ation to the large cities by water. The above engraving represents a scene in winter at one of the largest company's depots, viz., Rockland Lake, which is situated about one mile distant from the River Hudson, al though in a part of the country 250 feet above the level of that river. The instruments used in cutting out the ice, are termed ice planes, or cutters, and ice ploughs, with which the fields of ice are marked off and cut into squares, and from there stored in large \" barns,\" or ice-houses, one of which will be seen in the above view. Some of those store-houses contain as much as 60,000 tons, where the blocks are built up in regular order, and covered over with long grass, saw-dust, shavings, etc., to preserve it from the ejxternal heat of summer. The ice-house represented above was built to contain 20,000 tons. Some idea of this trade may be formed, when we state that about $10,000,000 is employed"], [328, "CONSUMPTION OF ICE \u2014 RAILROADS IN AMERICA. 40 in it, in different parts of the States.

It is estimated that 40 men, with 12 horses, can cut and stow away about 400 tons in one day. RAILROADS IN AMERICA The British traveller, on going over the railroads in America, is apt to find more fault with the construction of the \"plant,\" or road itself, than he is with the \"rolling stock,\" such as cars, etc. He will miss all the well-made fences along the lines, that firm ballast ing of the road, those solid stone or brick built station-houses, with locked gates \u2014 at which you can neither get out nor in till you are allowed ingress or egress \u2014 the array of porters in suits of olive green corduroy, and guards in suits of bottle-green cloth, with chronome ter and whistle slung over their shoulders. There is Uttle of that to be seen in America. For the most part, the whole train dashes along through fields, over cross roads, through forests and swamps, with all the freedom and independence characteristic of the country. If an unfortunate cow should happen to be taking an airing along the line, the \" cow catcher\" lifts her off her legs before she knows where she is, and tosses her into some soft ditch, perhaps, at the road side, with such a lesson as she will not forget in a hurry, if she happens to have the power of recollection left within her at all ! Any one \" on the tramp\" along \" the track\" is warned of the approach of the train by the loud-sounding bell, which he will be very deaf, indeed, if he does not hear, letting alone the great, hoarse, unearthly cry from the locomotive, to get out of the way. The stranger is apt to find fault, more particularly, in there being only one \"track\" or line of rails, on many of the lines \u2014 and few of them being, as we have said, so firmly made or ballasted as the lines in Great Britain. In some lines this is very apparent, and not only in the laying of the rails, but in the construction of very temporary looking wooden bridges \u2014 the bad policy of building which has been found out by this time. In such lines as the Grand Trunk of Canada and the Great Central of Pennsylvania, (from Philadelphia to Pittsburg,) or the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, the case is different \u2014 such lines more resembling, in substantiality, British made railroads. There is only one way, we think, of accounting for this difference in the solidity of the roads of 'he two countries. If not mistaken, there is a difference of no less than \u00a330,000 in the construction of every mile of railroad in the United States, compared with that in Britain ; that is to say, that the average cost of every mile of road (1853) in the United States was about \u00a35,460, whereas every mile in Great Britain and Ireland averages the sum of \u00a335,400 ($177,000), making, as we have stated, about \u00a330,000 per mile of difference in the cost of the railroads of the two countries. No doubt the single lines of road constructed here, together with the free grants of land, ought not to have cost any thing like what the double lines of rail in Britain cost, still it is quite evident that tbe American roads have cost a trifle in comparison to those there, and hence, we think, the reason why American railroads are not so substantially built as they would have been, had the same proportionate amount of money been spent upon them as on those in Britain. The lands in Great Britain, through which the lines pass, were a heavy item of expense in the construction of railroads, but that again, is in some measure counterbalanced by the high rates paid for labour and the extra cost of much of the material in America, compared with what such was procured at in Britain. To cover the extent of territory they have done, we do not see how the Americans could"], [329, "41 COST OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN RAILROADS. have done otherwise. They were determined to open up their country, to give their peo ple in distant parts the benefit of railroad locomotion, and if it was not to be had in so substantial a manner as in Great Britain, they appeared to make the most of their capital \u2014 whether it was borrowed or not. The construction of many of their bridges seems to be the greatest error they have made; but experience is now showing them, that the sooner they replace all wooden ones with iron or stone, the sooner will their lines pay better dividends, and afford more public confidence. Tn 1853, they had then in progress of completion, no less than 12,681 miles of railroad, in addition to which they had 13,266 miles actually in operation, the latter being close upon as many miles as was in operation over all Europe at that time \u2014 which wa3 14,142 miles. Since then, we find that, at the commencement of 1858, they had in operation, no less than twenty-six thousand two hundred and ten miles of railroad, the average cost of which per mile, is estimated about $35,000 (\u00a37,000), and that the total cost of the 26,210 miles opened was $919,990,516, or \u00a3183,998,103, or say, in round numbers, \u00a3184,0u0,000 sterling. Had they constructed their lines on the same expensive scale as those of Great Britain, it would have taken the sum of about \u00a3918,523,800 stg. \u2014 a sum, we presume, not likely to have been raised for the construction of railways, alone, in America. The conclusion, therefore, seems to us to be, that had the Americans not built their roads as they have done, thousands of miles of country dow opened up, and thousands of acres now under cultivation, and yielding crops, would have been still dreary prairies or forests, with a poor probability of the country advancing as it has done. Taking, therefore, every thing into account \u2014 how they had money to raise \u2014 the distance they had to bring much of their iron (in bringing it from Great Britaiu) \u2014 the high price of their labour \u2014 and the immense territory they have covered with the iron net work \u2014 it is only another proof of that indomitable, thorough going \" go-ahead\" character of the people, in accomplishing what they have done, and, considering all these things, will assist us to account, why it is that their roads are not so well built as those of Great Britain and Ireland. According to the American Railroad Journal, we find that \"the total receipts of the roads will probably reach, $120,000,000 (or \u00a324,000,000 sterling,) and that the net receipts will probably reach, at least, 5 per cent on their entire cost.\" One fact connected with railway travelling, in America, is that you may travel over some thousands of miles, and never pass through a solitary tunnel, the whole of the roads being chiefly laid in the valleys of hilly parts of the country. Amongst other officers connected with railways may be mentioned The Master of Transportation, who is intrusted with procuring and accommodating the trade and travel of the line with the rates of fares, the getting up of time tables, the running arrangements, and other details connected with the proper working of the line. Tlie Master of Machinery, who has the full superintendence and control of all matters relatirg to purchasing, building, repairing of the locomotives and cars, and general rolling plant of the line. The Master of the Road, who has the general charge of all matters relating to the metals, sleepers, bridges, tunnels, and, in fact, all the buildings on the line\u2014 providing water\u2014 and other duties essentially necessary for the efficient working of the road. Having thus noticed the plant, construction, and management of the line, we will now notice a little of the \" rolling stock,\" and its management First, then, we will notice the railroad carriages. RAILWAY CARS. The \" carriages\" of Great Britain are styled \" cars\" in America. Here they are dif ferently constructed. Instead of the small compartments for 6 first-class, or 8 or 10 second-class passengers, as in Britain, the whole car inside is an open space, as a saloon-"], [330, "42 THE AMERICAN RAILROAD PASSENGER CARS. carriage. Up the centre there is a passage. The seats are arranged on each side of the pas sage, and fitted up handsomely with crimson plush velvet seats and backs for 2 passengers in each seat. By an ingenious contrivance, the backs of the seats are made to turn right over the seat, thus 2 passengers can sit with their faces opposite to other 2, which is very handy when 4 of a party wish to talk together, or have a game at cards, chess, etc., etc. The whole interior fittings of the cars are good, with mirrors at each end. In the corner of all carriages there is a private retiring saloon, with water-closets, etc. On some lines there is one for ladies and another for gentlemen, in each car. Each car conveys from 50 to 60 passengers. Almost all the cars open at the ends, where there is a platform extend- THE AMERICAN 'RAILROAD PASSENGER CAR. ing out about 2 feet ; thus the platform of one carriage joins that of another, and with the doors at both ends of the car, opening like the door of a room, a passage is thus formed from one end to the other of the entire train. Along the ceiling of each car, there is a rope, which is attached throughout the whole train, so that the conductor, or any passenger, in any part of the train ean stand up and \u2014 by pnlling this rope \u2014 ring a bell which is placed at the side of the engine driver, and thus stop the train, if necessary. By this means, serions accidents are avoided, and passengers experience a feeling of safety, by having such means within their reach. This is rather an improvement, it must be allowed, on the boasted efficiency of some of the English rail roads, the trains of which have been known, sometimes, to catch fire, and have the whole train flying along in a blaze, and passengers burned before the engine driver could be com municated with. We allude more particularly to an occurrence of that nature which oc curred on the Great Western (of England) Railroad, some time ago. There is only one class of cars in the United States for all classes, excepting emigrants. Emigrant cars are just like the 3d-class carriages in Britain, only that they are arranged in the same style inside, as lst-class cars here. The cars are much longer \u2014 say about half a length longer than the average length of carriages iD Britain \u2014 or about the same length as some of the long carriages on the Glas gow and Greenock, or London and South-eastern lines of railroads there. The body of the car rests upon swivels attached to a sort of truck, or carriage of 4 wheels \u2014 (2 at each Bide). One of those trucks are under each end of the carriage ; there is thus a free space of about 30 feet between the fore and after wheels of the cars. The car thus placed on these trucks, and upon swivels, as stated, enables them to be run over curves with much greater ease and safety than if constructed on the British plan. In fact, we do not think that the British railroad carriage could travel, with safety, so fast in this country as what the American car does, simply owing to the construction of the road, and the build of the car, with wheels so close to each other, and body having no room to \" play,\" or swing round a little, in turning a curve. On tbe other hand, again, we fancy, that a car, built on the American model, would travel infinitely more easy, and much more safe-"], [331, "CARS OF AMERICA AND ENGLAND \u2014 THE LOCOMOTIVE. 43 ly, when going round some of those beautiful sharp curves which occur here and there on some British lines, or in \"going over the stones\" on such as the line from Penniston to Shef field, or from Bishopstoke to Salisbury (Eng.). The external appearance of the cars are exceedingly plain \u2014 and, on entering for the first time, one is not prepared to find them so handsomely fitted up as they are. For our part we prefer these saloon-carriageB, so well and comfortably fitted up, to even some of the first-clas3 carriages in Britain, with their compartments of six each, where, ten chances to one, if you can get a seat, without being half suffocated with heat from windows being closed, or with tobacco smoke, from, perhaps, 2 or 3 cigars blaziDg away beside you. Whereas, to compare the best 2d-class carriages in Great Britain with the cars in this country, is out of the question\u2014 setting aside altogether, the intolerable nui sance which the non-smoking public in England feel, in being compelled to travel, as it might be, in a small, cramped-up smoking saloon, with, sometimes, the smokers not over civil or agreeable, even when females are present. For ourselves, we would rather pre fer Borne of the emigrant cars here to such 2d-class carriages as are to be found, for in stance, on the London and South-Western Railroad, between Portsmouth and Southamp ton, where an ordinary sized man cannot sit upright with his hat on, far less stand up in one. Such cramped-up dog-kennels as these, and some of the old 2d-class carriages on the London and North-Western, and other lines, are unknown in this country. The only fault the cars here have, is in the winter season when the stoves, which are then placed in them, are over-heated, sometimes, making them uncomfortable in that respect, a fault, however, which does not rest with the construction of the car, so much as in the misman agement, or over-heating of the stove, in the same mariner in which the Americans over heat their houses in winter, rendering them uncomfortably hot for British visitors. Whilst travelling on tbe cars here, 6trangers are cautioned to keep their arms and heads inside the cars, as, possibly, when exposing them outside, the train ma}T pass a bridge, or pile of wood, where there is no room to allow for passing such with safety with any part of the body thus exposed. Standing on the platform outside, between the cars, is also for bidden, as, in that case, the company will not be responsible for any accident which may happen when parties are standing there. THE LOCOMOTIVE. The railway engine is, of course, similarly constructed to those of Great Britain, as a locomotive must be pretty much the same in all parts of the world. The engines of America are characterized by great expense being put on essternal painting and decoration of the body and finishing of the outward working parts. A large amount of bright pol ished iron, steel, and brass-work is to be seen about all American-made engines, as can be seen in strong contrast on the Great Western Railway of Canada, for example, where some Newcastle or Manchester-made engines are running. Their dirty, dark-green hue forms any thing but a pleasing contrast to the bright polished work of the American engine. The most prominent features in appearance, however, is in the chimney adopted in this country, which is certainly more useful than ornamental, and yet, it is about as handsome as the plain Btraight up-and-down chimney pots on the engines of the Caledonian Railway (Scotland). The peculiar form of the American chimney is necessary, on account of burn ing wood, and the quantity of sparks which fly up the inner funnel, but which are caught at the top, by what is called the \" spark arrester,\" which forms a part of the outside fun nel, seen to view. So that, after all, there is utility if there is not ornament in the said un gainly-looking funnel referred to. A bell is attached to all engines, which is rung by a rope in the hand of the driver as he starts, or is about to stop, or when passing over cross ings of roads. As an improvement upon the \"spectacles\" of the British railroad engine for the protec tion of driver and stoker from the wind and weather, the covering of the American engine is most decidedly superior, protecting on all sides, as well as from above, the driver and"], [332, "THE AMERICAN RAILROAD LOCOMOTIVE. 44 stoker, and rendering them nearly as comfortable as if inside a ear altogether, and yet with light and room enough to perform their duty properly. Tlie \" cow-catcher\" at the front\u2014 which takes the place of the \" life-guard\" of the British engine\u2014 is a very formidable-looking affair, and carries in its triangled shape and huge iron bars, any thing but an idea of its benevolent intentions of saving the lives of all the THE AMERICAN RAILROAD LOCOMOTIVE, WITH \"COW-CATCHER\" ANU ALL THE OTHER \" PIXINS\" COMPLETE. sundry animals which come in its way. Yet so it is found, that wh ox, for instance, would be certain almost to be killed in coming in di the perpendicular front of the engine, when flying along the rails \u2014 the other hand, catches them so that they are lifted at once off their feet, either the one side or the other of the line, thus giving them a greatei with life than otherwise. Sometimes animals are thus caught up and without any serious injury, although, at other times, they are killed that where a cow, sheep, or direct contact against rails \u2014 the cow-catcher, on the feet, and rolled off on to greater chance of escaping thrown on one side on the spot before"], [333, "THE CONDUCTOR AND NEWSMAN. 45 they are thrown off the cow-catcher. Such an article is more necessary in America, where the lines are not protected by fences as they are in Britain, and consequently much more subject to cattle straying about on them. THE RAILROAD CONDUCTOR. In attendance upon each train, there is a driver, stoker, one conductor, two or three brakesmen, and an attendant in the shape of waiter \u2014 who acts also as travelling newsman, bookseller, and dealer in Yankee notions. The conductor on an American railroad is a smart, gentlemanly looking person gen erally, and were it not for a very small badge which he wears either on his cap or coat breast, you could not tell him from any ordinary gentleman traveller. He is \u2014 as he requires to be \u2014 a sharp, shrewd man of business, with the eye of an eagle, excellent powers of dis crimination as regards the various forms human nature takes, when passing under his re view \u2014 thoroughly \" posted up\" as to all the \" wild cat,\" \" broken bank,\" and \" uncurrent\" notes in circulation \u2014 who can tell a counterfeit 25 cent piece by feeling, without troubling himself to look at it \u2014 and who, withal, is particularly attentive to ladies, in pro viding them with seats in cars \u2014 where mostly ladies, or ladies accompanied by gentlemen are \u2014 and who, upon the whole, is civil, obliging, and attentive, with a sharp look-out after tickets, and those who have none. On a summer's morning, you will find him enter the car, as he gives the word \" all aboard,\" dressed as if newly out of a band-box, in a suit of white, or unbleached linen, from head to foot, hat and boots included. For a rollicking bit of fun, he will enter the carriage, giving some well-known passenger a \" dig in the ribs,\" as he sings out his morn ing salutation of \" How are you, old feller !\" at the same time saying to the passenger, \" I cal'clate you didn't see the calf we ketched upon the cow-ketcher.\" On the passenger pro fessing his ignorance as to such an event having happened, but, being very desirous of get ting \" posted\" on the subject, is eager for all the information he can get \u2014 the conductor, in return, still bent on a bit of fun to start the day's business with, then relates in his own peculiar fashion \u2014 which it is hopeless for us to describe, and more particularly regarding all the incidents connected with the catching of the animal referred to, and the variations, exclamations, emendations, and additions with which he garnished up his wonderful story \u2014 suffice to say that the story was well told, and ended by the conductor completely \" sell ing\" his eager listener, when he told him, with a rich leer in the one eye, that the animal was on board, and he (the passenger) was the calf. With that, the conductor would bolt to the other end of the car, leaving the whole company in a roar of laughter at the unfortunate wight who was so eager to hear something of the marvellous, which Brother Jonathan is always ready to supply, when he can meet with a proper customer who will take it in. There is another character \" on board\" the car, however, it would almost be unpardon able to omit noticing, namely, the attendant newsman. THE RAILROAD NEWSMAN AND BOOKSELLER. In America, there are almost no book-stalls connected with the railroad stations, as in Great Britain, where newspapers, periodicals, books, etc., are sold in such vast quantities. It must not be imagined, however, that the railroad traveller is neglected, in that respect, as will be found by experience on the lines, here. Started on your journey, you have not gone far before you are visited by the attendant newsman alluded to, \" Morning paper, sir 1\" \" morning paper, sir 1\" and thus he goes from one end of the train to the other, selling the morning paper for, perhaps, 3 cents \u2014 being one cent above publisher's price \u2014 but cheap enough withal. After he thinks you have had time to \" read, mark well, and inwardly digest\" all the 3 cents' worth, he visits you again, dispensing this time gratuitous literature, by handing to all and sundry a bill of"], [334, "THE RAILROAD NEWSMAN \u2014 \"PUSHING THE TRADE.\" 46 some \" heavier\" article in the literary market \u2014 \" Life and Times of Hugh Miller,\" just out, giving particulars regarding that publication \u2014 the great sale it has had \u2014 and if you wish to consider yourself a well \" posted-up\" man on such matters, you ought lo buy a copy at the price of\u2014 the almighty dollar. You have just finished reading the prospectus, when he returns and picks up all the prospectuses, as he cannot afford to have them either wasted, or to give you one gratis. You wait to see \" what next,\" when next he appears with an armful of books nicely bound, one of which he hands to every passenger. It is, \" Life and Times of Hugh Miller.\" He thus passes through the car, and having given you an oppor tunity of perusing prospectus and work also, he waits a little till you have begun to scan the pages over, and when you are nicely at work perusing some interesting story con nected with the life of that excellent specimen of Scotland's self-made men, the attendant is at your elbow, and at your ear also, making the polite remark, \" Only one dollar, sir j\" if you hesitate \u2014 \" the greatest book out, sir.\" Still you are doubtful \u2014 \" No man but thinks of having that book, sir ;\" and, at last, between the eloquence of the author and salesman of the book, you are minus one dollar, but an addition to your library of one volume. Thus you watch the tact and perseverance without many words, with which the newsman goes along, selling all he can of those he had left with the passengers. He now disappears. By-and-by his next visit is in another character. By this time, he supposes you are getting thirsty \u2014 we will not suppose, for a moment, on account of the matter being rather dry, that he had, a few minutes before, sold you; but, at all events, he appears now with a tin can full of iced water, which he dispenses in a tumbler to every thirsty person, gratis \u2014 handling both articles with some nicety \u2014 as the train flies along. Thus he supplies all who wish to drink. Having completed his journey in this line of business, he shortly appears again, loaded with another supply of books. This time, it is a \" Railroad Guide.\" He leaves a copy of that also as before, and proceeds on. After you have perused it, you, probably, are inclined to be posted up as to the time of the railroad, as well as the time of day, and feel disposed to invest 25 cents for that \u2014 well-invested money as the newsman may tell you \u2014 \" save many a train, sir.\" So on he passes, picking up those copies not wanted, and picking up the quarter dollars where they are to be met with. In this way does this attendant pass and repass, delivering, selling, and taking up copies of books of all sorts \u2014 magazines, illustrated newspapers, etc. \u2014 so that, between reading what you may have bought, and glancing over all those which are thrown in temptation's way, the time on a railroad, in America, passes away very fast, even although you should be travelling without any acquaintance to converse with. After a lapse of an hour or so, and after he has exhausted his variety of good things for the mind, our industrious friend now appears with something approaching to \" lolly pops\" in appearance, but intended as food for the body. This is the veritable \" pop corn,\" all done up in paper bags, at \" only 5 cents apiece.\" You have, probably, never tasted pop corn, you see every body else investing, and so goes another twentieth part of the said almighty dollar, for a bag of pop corn. From its starchy white look and appearance to some nice confectionary, you expect to get a sweet mouthful However, you will be disappointed, whether agreeably or not, we do not say, as that is a matter of taste. All we can say is, that we like it well enough, and that it appears to be a great favourite, from the quantities you will see consumed on cars, steam boats, in theatres, etc. It 13 the Indian Corn, subjected to heat, by some process, and blown up into a light confectionary-looking article, sprinkled over with salt, and a very healthy and, we dare say, nourishing article, for those who like it Having left you to finish your stock of \"pop corn,\" the faithful attendant is at your service once more, and if you were disappointed at his last visit, by not getting 6omc \" lolly pops,\" as you expected, you will now have an opportunity of investing another quarter of a dollar on some genuine \"candy\" of Mr. Somebody's excellent manufac ture. There is no mistake this time, so you are inclined to speculate once more. But 25 cents' worth of candy, what are you going to do with all that ? If you are at a"], [335, "THE NEWSMAN \u2014 RAILROAD REFRESHMENT STATIONS. 47 loss, the attendant will at once give you a proof of his kindness, and afford you an opportunity to exercise yours, by suggesting that it will no doubt afford you pleasure to divide it with the \" little dears\" in the seat before or behind you, and if there are none actually so close at hand, he will find some in the train who will become the grateful re cipients of your benevolent kindness. Thus appealed to, you may be led to be generous ; or, if in stoical humour that day, in that respect, you begin to look at both sides of youi quart\"r dollar, before you exchange it for the packet of candy, done up so inviting as it is in white and gold paper. The \" pop corn,\" however, by this time, urges the necessity of something to allay the thirst which it created ; so you begin to hesitate, and, at last, make up your mind you will not spend 25 cents on candy then \u2014 it's too much. To eat it all, perhaps, would turn the equilibrium of your stomach, and, whilst in that mood, between hesitation and want, the attendant \u2014 faithful man \u2014 puts an end to your soliloquy by the information that \" Wall, I guess you can have a dime's worth\" That will do \u2014 a bargain is struck, and you hand out your 10 cents, and he gives you a portion of a package, value one dime. Thus engaged, therefore, between allaying your thirst with the candy, and en joying your investments in literature, you whirl along till you come to a station where the iron horse takes in fuel and water. \" All aboard\" again, and you are once more meditating upon some of the beauties of nature, which you are passing rapidly, when another attendant appears, with a great bundle of newspapers under his arm. At the last 6topping-place, the faithful attendant, who had so sedulously attended to your mental and material wants \u2014 with profit to himself and to you \u2014 has disappeared from off the 6tage \u2014 of the car, at all events \u2014 and you 6ee no more of him. His place is taken by another, who has come up the line, perhaps 40 or 50 miles, with an up train, with the evening paper of the next large town or city you are approaching. \" Important news by telegraph ;\" \" News by the ocean telegraph ;\" \" To-day's London news.\" You are now hit home, perhaps, and in your eagerness to know what the news is, you inquire \" What is it?\" when you are brought to your senses by the dollar-and-cent laconic reply, \" 3 cents, sir.\" You had forgot ; the newsman, however, had not ; 60 you hand out 3 cents, and have it all before you. Between your morning paper, your evening paper, your one dollar volume, your Rail road Guide, your pop corn, and your candy, and sundry drinks of water, you have been pretty well occupied during the journey, and we are bound to think that you have not wearied any more with travelling only at the rate of 20 miles per hour, than you v.'ould have done if you had been on the Great Western Express, railing it at the punctual time of 60 miles an hour, with \" Hell Fire Jack\" as driver, from London to Bristol. The newsman on the railroad car is a character perfectly unique, and only to be met with on an American railroad, or steamboat sometimes. RAILROAD REFRESHMENT STATIONS. The great distinguishing difference between the refreshment saloon at the railway sta tions here and iu Britain is, that those in Britain arc, for the most part, occupied with bars, for the sale of liquors of all kinds, and wretched tea and coffee, or soup \u2014 with the latter so scalding hot, however, that you have neither time nor patience to wait till it is cool enough to enjoy it. In America it is just the reverse. The bar, where intoxicating liquors are sold, is scarcely to be seen at some stations. It forms a very secondary place in the establishment. The refreshment saloon proprietor finds it necessary to supply the best, most wholesome, and substantial victuals for travellers, whilst the railroad companies allow their passengers time to enjoy them. People in this country have no idea of travelling 300 or 400 miles, on an old fusty biscuit, or spunge cake, and keeping up the \" inner man\" with brandy and water, or pale ale \u2014 things all very well in their proper place, but not to travel upon for from 12 to 24 hours. Dinner. \u2014 In your journey along the line, we omitted to convoy you to the dining saloon. When, therefore, the bell on the engine has rung its last stroke of stoppage, you jump off the car, and are informed \u2014 \" 20 minutes here for dinner.\" You are now, probably, landed"], [336, "A WAY-SIDE REFRESHMENT SALOON\u2014 SLEEPING CARS. 48 at a station not far from a dense forest, or in the midst of a deep valley, with a range of mountains, perhaps, on every side, with nothing to be heard but the \"iron horse snorting till he comes to a stand-still, and the sound from his nostril reverberating through the val ley and re-echoed again and again. You feel disposed to disappointment in be.ng landed at such a primitive-looking station, which presents, from all yon see around you, externally, such scanty means of providing a good dinner, for you, who have tasted nothing very sub stantial, probably, from 5 to 6, a. m., and now it is 12.30 or 1, p. m. Besides, there is not the magnificent refreshment saloon as in England, like the Midland at Derby, or Carhsle with its ecclesiastical looking ceiling, and its baronial fire-place. If you have not that you have, in just such a station as that of Stafford, or at Bristol, a wooden refreshment-room, well stocked inside. You now enter the dining-room\u2014 take your seat\u2014 and we will guarantee you will get a most sumptuous dinner, there and then, for 50 cents, (or 2s. stg.,) and have time to take it in comfort, compared with the \" bolting\" necessary at some of the refreshment stations in Great Britain, where you have to pay 62* cents (or 2s. 6d stg.). At this country way-side station, they are all prepared for your coming, every thing Is ready to the minute the train is due. Most of the dishes are cut up, all ready, and, between soup, delicious trout from the mountain streams at hand, farm-yard poultry, mut ton, beef, pork, vegetables, and pies and tarts innumerable, with, for dessert\u2014 in summer sea son\u2014water-melons, musk-melons, huckleberries, and several fruits we cannot name, to gether with pure iced-water\u2014 we can vouch you have finished, most satisfactorily, 20 min utes' good hard work in the use of knife and fork. You now retire, we will be bound to say, agreeably disappointed with the refreshment-saloon, even at a way-side station in the United States of America. At some stations, the charge is only 25 cents, and a very good dinner is got All the passengers, sit down at an immense long table. There are no 2d-class refreshment-room stations\u2014 all are 1 st-class, but at 2d-class English prices. The conductor, driver, and all the attendants of the train, join at the universal table ; but none of them until they have washed themselves in the washroom adjoining the dining-saloon. Breakfast. \u2014 Travellers who start very early in the morning, or who may have been travelling all night, will hail the arrival at the breakfast station, with its plenty of good cheer, in hot coffee, tea, toast, potatoes, ham and eggs, beef steaks, mutton chops, bread and butter, eggs, (boiled, poached, and fried,) etc., etc., etc., with a tumbler of iced-water. Charge for such varies from 25 to 50 cents, depending upon localities, and set out. Time allowed, 20 minutes. Tea oe Suppek. \u2014 Generally about 5 o'clock \u2014 unless near destination of chief terminus \u2014 the train will stop for tea or 6upper, allowing 20 minutes. The fare presented is similar to breakfast, with the addition of pies, tarts, etc., with all kinds of preserves. Charge, 25 to 50 cents. Of course there are no fees to waiters. At all the refreshment-saloons on the rail roads here, the attendance is most efficient, with damsels which rival, in every respect, the far-famed waitresses at such as Wolverton, Stafford, Peterborough, or Swindon stations, in England. SLEEPING CARS ON RAILWAYS. Amongst the many improvements introduced in connection with comfortable locomotion, none of so important a character for travellers by night trains has ever been introduced as that of the sleeping berths fitted up for passengers in some of the railroads in Canada and the United States. On the Grand Trunk Railroad in Canada, the sleeping cars are the most comfortable of any we have seen ; almost in every respect like the berths of a first-class cabin in a steamer \u2014 all enclosed, with the conveniences and comforts of a good bed, washstaud, etc. \u2014 so that travellers going between Montreal and Toronto during night, can go to bed and rise in the morning at their destination much more refreshed than if they had sat up all night. This luxury can be enjoyed by paying $1 extra. On several lines in the United States cars are fitted up similarly, but not quite so completely nor so comfortable as those in Canada, al though a great improvement so far. Between Cleveland and Cincinnati, for instance, each"], [337, "CHURCHES OF AMERICA \u2014 ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. 49 car is fitted up for 56 berths, for which the extra charge is 50 cents each. Altogether, it is a move in the right direction, and, we should suppose, might be adopted with advantage on the long line runs of such as the Great Northern and London and North-Western, be tween LondoD and Edinburgh, the night trains of which, for comfortable accommodation, are nothing to compare with the cars alluded to in this country. On the Pennsylvania Central Road, there are high-backed sofa seats, which one ean repose upon very comfort ably, at no extra charge. THE CHURCHES OF AMERICA. The elegance of the churches in the United States and Canada is well known to every American traveller. Whilst there cannot be, of course, such venerable edifices to be seen i_s the fine old cathedrals of such as Salisbury, York, London, and Westminster, (Eng.,) or Glasgow and Elgin, (Scot,) yet we have no hesitation in saying, that in modern churches, those of Canada or the States will compare favourably with any in Great Britain or Ire land, either in artistic excellence in architectural design, as well as substantiality. We know of few towns in Great Britain, which, in comparison with its size, can show such a turn out of elegant places of worship as is to be seen, for example, in the city of Toronto. In one or two other towns, such as Montreal, the Catholics excel in the external beauty as well as 6ize of their cathedrals, although internally they are nothing to boast of, some of them even betraying, in our opinion, very bad taste. The English Episcopalian cathe dral and churches, as well as those of the Congregationalist and other bodies again, both externally and internally, show generally excellent taste, combined with great comfort. The Presbyterian churches, both English and Scotch, also present some very handsome edifices, excelling, as a general rule, we think, the buildings which the Scotch Free Church Presbyterians have been erecting lately in many of the Scotch towns, most of which, for tunately, make no pretensions to architectural beauty of design. For the same amount of money which many of these churches have cost, if the Americans had had to build them, they would in all probability have erected neat and tastefully-designed churches entirely of wood, and by painting them white, with green round the windows and doors, and with their bright green Venetian blinds, would have presented, aB they do in country districts here, churches and chapels, that, however small, at once commend themselves for their ele gance and neatness. In the large cities on the seaboard, such as New York, in the lavish expenditure of money which must have been spent on the maguificent edifices there, we should say, that the Americans have good reasons to be church- proud. (See New York, for engravings of such.) THE ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH. On visiting the churches in the United States and Canada, the stranger will find them well filled, generally speaking. In summer time, the ladies are to be seen going dressed in the most expensive muslins and laces, with bare arms, perhaps, under elegant mantillas of the most zephyr thinness, displaying easily the shape of the figure, be it handsome or otherwise. In the autumn or \" fall,\" the most gorgeous silks, brocades, and velvets are worn. This being the age of \" hoops,\" of course the ladies assume larger dimensions than usual; the use of that article in this country being carried to as great excess as we think it possible to be done. As a general rule, the congregations of all places of worship are exceedingly well dressed, and present, in summer time, some features rather different fiom those in Britain. In the 6-ummer time, ladies take fans with them to church \u2014 the value of that article ranging from a 5-cent dried palm-leaf, to every sort and design of the most costly Chinese and French manufacture. During the service, the fans are kept in almost constant motion in cooling their possessors, much, we should suppose, to the annoyance of the speaker, seeing these waving back and forward before his eyes, at rates varying from 5 to 60 miles per hour. The gentlemen go in suits, some of black, some white, some drab, and some brown, just ."], [338, "50 DRESS AT CHURCH \u2014 CHURCH PSALMODY. it suits their taste, convenience, or comfort Many with whole suits of white linen, and being newly washed and \" got up,\" with pure white shirt-fronts, turn-down collars, and small ribbon for neck-tie, look uncommonly well, neat, and clean-looking, and, in the hot weather, the most comfortable dress of all. As we have sat broiling under our black coat, vest, and trowsers\u2014 all woollen\u2014 we have many times envied those gentlemen in white and fine linen. In the matter of hats, too, the big black chimney pot is thrown aside by many, and the light straw or felt hat adopted in its place, so that, dressed up as now described, with a pair of thin patent leather boots or shoes, fit for a ball, it will be seen, that the American gentleman dresses so as to be as easy, light, and comfortable as he can. Little boys are similarly dressed as the gentlemen ; and girls\u2014 women in miniature\u2014 they must follow the fashion allotted to them, and are dressed and screwed up like so many big dolls, but certainly with the most exquisite neatness and taste, and some of them at no small cost. In the winter months it is just the very reverse of all this. Nothing can be too thick, almost, from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, for ladies, gentlemen, aud children. The working classes turn out to church exceedingly well dressed, and if it was difficult to tell, at one time, the difference between a Manchester or Glasgow factory-girl from the daughter of a mill-owner, on Sunday, it is pretty much the case now in America \u2014 Sally of the hotel or the private residence, as well as the well-paid workman's wife, being de sirous of showing off as well as those of the \" upper ten\" \u2014 not forgetting their fan, either, when they go out CHURCH PSALMODY. On entering almost any church, chapel, or meeting-house of any denomination what ever, the stranger must at once be struck with the most excellent psalmody which he hears in the places of worship. Generally speaking, there is as great a difference between the psalmody and music in American churches, when compared with that heard in England, as there is between the sing-song, drawling, unmusical notes to be heard in some of the churches in country parishes in Scotland, when compared with the music in such as St. Bride's, in Fleet street, or Rev. Dr. Binnie's, in Fish-street Hill, London. The reason appears to us to arise from the study which the Americans, as a people, give to the art, commencing with them when very young at the piano or melodeon, and hav ing thus early learnt it, become to like it, and carry it into their religious services. In the choirs of places of worship, as is well known, the wives and daughters of the most respectable families assist, and scarcely is there a choir, we should say, but what can boast of its prima donna, belonging to the upper classes, amongst its volunteer assistants. Struck, sometimes, with some particular tenor, towering above all the others, we have found, upon inquiry, the voice to be that of the lady of Mr. A., the importer, or hearing an ex cellent bass voice, were told it was Mr. B., the manufacturer. In some of the churches in the large cities is this particularly the case, the singing being such as we fancy could not fail to arrest the attention, and please the man who does not know even one note from an other. In some congregations, the hymn books have musical notes printed in; others, again, have music books with airs only \u2014 consequently, a large trade is done in supplying congregations with sacred music books, or with hymn books set to music. We do not find, however, that the congregations, as a body, let their voices be heard, any more than they are heard in many churches in Britain. They appear to allow the choir and the organ to do the work, and in many churches they are mere listeners. As an exception to this, may be named such as Rev. Mr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn, New York. There the whole congregation appear to sing with hearty good will \u2014 in itself, a treat to hear. Every place of worship has a musical instrument of some kind, generally an organ, or melodeon. Even the small congregation, in tbe large Scotch Presbyterian Church of St. Andrew, at Clifton, (Canada West,) appears to have been inoculated in favour of a musical instrument, for without waiting, we presume, for authority from headquarters, (being a"], [339, "LUMBER AND LUMBERMEN. 51 Scotch established church) they have asserted the right in their adopted land\u2014 and being in close proximity to the \"land of liberty\"\u2014 to introduce a melodeon to assist their psal mody, and with good effect in singing the good old-fashioned psalms and paraphrases of the \" authorized version.\" A controversy is now going on in the church meetings, in Canada, upon the subject of introducing instrumental music into churches, similar to that which is going on in Scot land, amongst the members of the United Presbyterian body there. LUMBER AND LUMBERMEN. The term \"lumber,\" is meant to represent all kinds of timber, whether in logs, deals, spars, shingles, or any other description of cut or uncut timber. \" Lumbermen\" as those who are employed in cutting down the timber, preparing it for, and making it into rafts, and \" rafting\" or sailing those rafts down the rivers to a port. Thus a raft is \" run\" or \" rafted\" down a river, when it is being taken to market to be sold. The term raftsmen is, therefore, synonymous with lumbermen, when conveying the lumber along the rivers. The lumbermen of Canada are chiefly French Canadians, and, in many respects, they lead a solitary, exposed, and hard-working life. In the summer season these men are engaged by large \"lumber houses,\" owners of im- mense tracts of forest lands and Bwamps. They are sent hundreds of miles up the country, to certain stations in' the interior ; along with them they take a supply of pork, flour, and biscuit, and warm clothing, sufficient to last over the winter season, and until the river navigation opens. When winter sets in, they are engaged \"chopping,\" or felling down the trees, and preparing them into logs. Some do nothing but chop ; others, again, attend to the \" logging,\" that is, yoking the bullocks and attending to them in drawing the logs out of the forest, to the nearest outlet of the river, or point, where they are prepared into rafts. Another is employed as cook for the party, who remains at home all day, preparing the food, and, perhaps, exercising himself in the use of the rifle, in bring- ing in some game so as to furnish an extra savory dish now and then. They live in wooden \" shanties,\" or log-houses, which, by plastering or the use of bark, are rendered as warm as any stone house. There, during the dreary months of winter, with snow and ice on every side, and a dense forest around them for many miles, do these hardy men exist, enlivening their evenings by games at cards, or probably reading the latest newspaper, if one, by any chance, should come in their way. The winter time, when every thing is frozen hard around them, is frequently a more comfortable time for them than at other seasons, when in swamps they are obliged to stand in water and chop or log. In winter they wear suits of the heavy Canadian cloth, alluded to elsewhere, with long boots, of a very heavy and substantial make. In Canada alone, it is estimated there are upwards of 30,000 lumbermen regularly emploj-ed, chiefly in the Ottawa, and far north-west districts. They are engaged for the season, perhaps. They go to work, live in the bush, as described, during the winter, and, after they have got all their logs made into rafts, they are prepared to \"run\" them when the ice disappears. The running of rafts is, sometimes, a very dangerous opera- tion, particularly on such as the Rivers Ottawa and St. Lawrence, where there are so many rapids ; however, by the use of long oars, at each end of the raft \u2014 each oar acting as a helm to steer with \u2014 and experience, the practised lumberman gets along without much dan- ger, excepting where he gets into a wide expanse of the river where the small lakes are formed, and a storm coming on, he runs the risk of the raft being blown in different directions, and thus \" wrecking\" the raft, sometimes, beyond hope of recovery, and with loss of life often. On such a lake as St. Peter's, on the St Lawrence, is this sometimes the case. We here give an engraving of rafts \"running\" the rapids of the St. Lawrence, at Cedars, Canada East, 36 miles S. W. from Montreal, which will give an idea of one of the most dangerous and exciting scenes during the voyage of a raft, on its way to market"], [340, "52 OF LUMBER RUNNING THE RAPIDS. RAFTI In some districts, the rafts are divided, and made to descend the \" slides\"\u2014 v*ere there are no rapids, or other means of conveying them past locks or falls. RAFTS OF LUMBER \"RUNNING\" THE RAPIDS, AT CEDARS, ON THE ST. LAWRENCE On the rafts are erected temporary houses, or huts, and with a cooking stove, barrels of flour, pork, etc. Thus they may be seen, making their way for hundreds of miles down the rivers to various ports on the St Lawrence, but particularly to Quebec, the greatest lumber shipping port in America. The lumbermen are engaged for so much per season, with victuals. When they arrive at Quebec with the rafts \u2014 the proceeds of their winter's work \u2014 they are then paid the amount due them, and are ready to engage for the next sea son. Sometimes the lumbermen are very troublesome, in breaking engagements with their employers, and hiring themselves to others when they get up the country. Employers"], [341, "THE LUMBER TRADE \u2014 FIRE-ENGINE ESTABLISHMENT. 53 complain of this, whilst the men, on the other hand, complain of bad treatment, or tbe terms of the engagement not being acted up to. An attempt was made to establish a registry of lumbermen in the Ottawa district, with the view of checking the evil alluded to, but nothing of a legislative character has yet been done, to render any such measures legally binding. The rafts on the Delaware, may be seen in similar manner, floating down to Philadelphia, which is the market for its lumber. All the large citieB on the seaboard aro more or less lumber markets, and by the cheapness of this article, are the people kept in a supply of firewood, (the only fuel in most places,) as well as material for building, fitting up, and furnishing houses, in doing which, the United States and Canada certainly do \" lick all creation.\" To give an idea of the magnitude of the trade done at Quebec, in the single article of lumber, of Canadian growth, we annex the following statement : \u2014 An Abstract of the Number of Pieces of all Lumber (square timber excepted) measured in Quebec during the season of 1S56. 1,518 masts and bowsprits; 1,608 spars ; 61,496 oars ; 2,639 cords of lathwood ; 1,878,173 standard pine deals ; 652,402 standard spruce deals ; 888,585 standard pine and spruce deals, uuculled ; 185,S S2 pine plank and boards, culled ; 15,110 pine plank and boards, counted ; 78,419 spruce plank and boards, culled ; 14,085 spruce plank and boards, counted ; 1,839,682 standard staves; 940,134 West India staves.

Who has not heard of this \" Institution\" \u2014 one so hallowed in the recollection of every American, from 15 to 100 years of age? As to the regular paid firemen of Great Britain, the British public care no more about them, than they do about their chimney sweeps, or street-scavengers. They are all men who are paid for doing their work, and are expected to do it weU. If they do not do it so, some one else will be got, who will do it right, and so there is an end of it Not so in America. The fire-engine of the Ameri can is associated with his first breath of life, perhaps the toy of his childhood, till it reaches into manhood with him \u2014 growing with his growth \u2014 his first thought in the morn ing, and, too often, his last thought and action at night. Grown out of a voluntary act, when towns were not able to support fire-engines, and pay men specially for looking af ter them, the institution of the fire-engine, and firemen companies, have become a power, alasl however, like all human greatness, destined to reach the summit of its greatness, and wane gradually till it disappears, at last, altogether from sight, or memory. To express an opinion against this institution at one time was tantamount to blasphemy\u2014 and to doubt their efficiency, as a body, was downright infidelity. It may be asked by some, who and what are these firemen there is so much said and written about 1 They are simply a body of men, generally young men and lads, who, in a particular district of a city, form themselves into a firemen's company, with the laudable desire of assisting in putting out fires, and saving the property at such as much as possible. The corporation furnishes them with an engine, engine-house, hose, hooks, ladders, etc., etc. They pay for the decoration and furnishing of their engine themselves. They are very particular about having their en gine to beat every other engine already in existence, or which ever may come into exist ence. It shall be more expensively painted and decorated. Its fittings of brass, copper, and silver-gilt, shall shine so as to dim the lustre of all others within eye-sight on a parade"], [342, "54 THE FIREMEN'S \"RUN OUT.\" day. Its power shall be such as to throw a jet of water higher than the highest yet at tained, and carry on its front, as a mark of its gallantry and strength, a pair of the horns of an ox. With all these beauties and qualifications, it must combine in it, all the ease, lightness, and grace of a fairy chariot, and none of the clumsy red and black painted wheels of an engine of Tilley's, or Merreweather's, of London. No; the \"Nonpareil\" fire-en gine of the 100th district \" Nonpareil Company,\" with the \" Knickerbocker Hook and Ladder Company,\" with hose, and hose-carriage, is a paragon, to match which the world is challenged. When the awful sound of a conflagration is heard tolling, mournfully, it may be, over the city, with the news of the \" devouring element\" being at work some where, it is then that the philanthropic fireman is to be seen in all his excitement and glory \u2014 then, that his bowels of compassion to save life as well as property, urges him to the scene \u2014 it is then, that the \"Nonpareil\" engine, with the \"Knickerbocker\" hook and ladder, and hose, close behind, are expected to be at the fire first of all. Yonder you see it coming scampering down the hill, in full flight with its 20 human horses in the traces, with red jackets and helmets, nearly eap-a-pie, rushing along, and clearing the streets as they go, with captain in front, and as he runs, shouting out, his orders through his sil ver-gilt trumpet. There they are in full cry, when behind them, another company with engine No. 1, wheels round the corner, and, in its attempting to pass the renowned \"Nonpa reil,\" gets jammed up against the first lamp post, and maimed for doing any more good or harm, for the remainder of that day or night. The \"Nonpareil\" still holds on its trium phant career, although it may have broken a leg or two of its members, in its encounter with No. 1. It arrives within half a gun shot of the scene of action, when another com pany, No. 2, drives up, before the redoubtable \" Nonpareil,\" and pitching into it, smashes its slender body, and all \"the fixings,\" into smithereens, till at last No. 2, and a few others arrive at the fire, and find it \u2014 a false alarm, after all. What is the meaning of all this 1 will be asked. Only \u2014 that the firemen of one company had sounded the alarm of fire, and wanting a run for themselves, thought they would show how soon they could be at a particular spot, in advance of all their neighbours, and thus take the \"shine\" out of them. In sober earnest, however, the foregoing is no exaggeration of a scene in going to an ac tual or reputed fire. The scenes of rivalry which the system has engendered, the fights at fires, the loafers and scoundrels of all sorts which have lately got connected with fire companies \u2014 whose only object is to get up fires for the sake of plunder \u2014 has led to the doom, as we believe, of the existence of volunteer companies in connection with fire-en gines and fire-brigades. Public opinion, backed by the insurance companies, have now found out a remedy for reducing the number of fires, and also the amount of destruc tion of property which follow them. That remedy is the establishing the steam fire-en gine, and a regular paid staff of firemen. The public in all the large cities almost, seem alive to the importance of adopting the new system, and appear to give it their hearty support, against the deadly opposition of the volunteer fire companies, who cannot but see that the day of their services is fixed \u2014 that their pet fire-engines may be put in glass cases as relics of the past, as soon as they like. Instead of a run out with their engine, and breaking sundry legs and arms or turning out of bed now and then to actual fires, they will be able to spend their evenino-s more pleasantly and profitably in the magnificent saloons and reading-rooms of their mer cantile libraries, and sleep sound at night without giving themselves any trouble whose property is on fire, as the iron horse, will, ere long, clear all before him, and soon drown out the biggest fire which has ever happened, in a 100th part of the time it would take 50 volunteer fire-engines, however neat and trim they may be."], [343, ""], [344, "THE STEAM FIKE-ENGINE, I The small engines will throw a li inch stream 200 feet horizontally ; two streams through a 1 inch nozzle 190 feet.

The largest en- gines are capable of discharging 2,000 barrels of water, and the smaller ones, 1,- 200 barrels, per hour. The cost of working one of these engines is about the same as that of the ordinary hand- worked engine."], [345, "55 THE STEAM FIRE-ENGINE \u2014 EXPRESS. THE STEAM FIRE-ENGINE. One of the greatest inventions of modern times, as connected with saving property from destruction and theft at fires, and for raising tbe dividends of fire insurance companies, is that of the application of steam to the fire-engine. In cities where these engines are in use, the dividends of the fire insurance companies have risen about 6 per cent ; people 6leep sound in bed at night, feeling confidence in the power of the fire (steam) engine \u2014 putting all fires out quickly, and in doing so, respecting property \u2014 with very few fires taking place now, compared with what occurred formerly. These are some of the results of the steam fire-engine being established. To Cincinnati belongs the honour of first setting the worthy example in this respect, and to one man there, viz., Miles Greenwood, of the Eagle Foundry, belongs the credit, more than to any other man, for carrying it out, although frequently at the risk of health and life. When at Cincinnati, we had an opportunity of seeing these engines at work, at fires, and most admirably did they answer the purpose. First of all, it must be understood, that, as in the London brigades, men are at the fire engine stations constantly, night and day. They have, moreover, towers at each, from the top of which a watch is kept all over the city, so that when a fire breaks out, it is seen at once. For each engine there are 4 powerful horses kept ready harnessed. Each engine is kept filled with water and fuel, and all ready to fire up. No sooner is the alarm of fire given, than one man puts a match to the fuel, when it is burning in a minute \u2014 the horses are yoked, and in two minutes are on their way to the Beene of the fire. The burning fuel in the engine is getting up the steam, and before six minutes has elapsed, steam is up to the required pressure, so that, on arriving at the fire, it is ready to work the en gine, and throw the water through the hose. If the steam is up before the destination is reached, it propels the engine forward, making it light work for the horses. At night, it is a novel sight to see the horses and steam-engine together, careering along the street, snorting up the steam and smoke as they gallop along, and making the fire-sparks fly from their heels. There is something positively grand and exeitiDg in such a sight, and one can not help, iu this matter, admiring the go-ahead character of the people, in a most practi cal direction. When they arrive at the scene of the fire, the horses are unyoked, and the firemen con nect the main hose of the engine, with the water-plugs \u2014 these conveying the water into the fire-engine \u2014 and from there, it is pumped against the fire. There the engines stand quietly working away, as easily as possible, with the stoker behind adding fuel, and an engineer in front looking after the machinery. The power of tlirowing water through these engines is almost beyond belief. Since their successful establishment in Cincinnati, almost all the large cities have been supplied with them. It is supposed, because the steam fire-engine cannot eat, drink, and bribe, that it has not made much greater headway in some cities ; however, its advantages are compelling its adoption, and, ere long, we should suppose, its use will be universal in all large towns. The steam fire-engine is made, also, for 2 horses, and. on some occasions, 6team has been got up in 4 minutes, 45 seconds. , EXPRESS. That's the word in America ! It is applied to every moving thing, animate and inani mate \u2014 to movements of the steamship, the locomotive, the body, as well as the mind. Every thing and every body is alive, and goes by express. The people live and think by express, as many of them acknowledge. From the forwarding a box of goods to their conclusions on the theory of human progression, all is express work. If you want to send a parcel 300 miles per \"goods train,\" and expect it delivered in 16 or 18 hours, as in England, you must send it here per \" express freight.\" In that case, however, you may be glad if you"], [346, "56 EXPRESS PEOPLE AND EXPRESS COMPANIES. have it delivered that distance off in 50 hours. If you wish to go 180 miles in 3 to 4 hours, as in England, simply per \" express,\" you must here go by the \" lightning express,\" and you need not fret your existence away because you are from 1 to 9 hours on the road. If, however, they cannot go by rail quite so fast as they do in Britain, with the or dinary goods trains or expresses, they make up for it other ways. Although some \" down easters\" are said to take a long time to \" calculate\" what they are revolving in their mind, the nervous New Yorker, and even the grey and drab Philadelphian will think and act 50 to 1 compared with many. They are the living types of \" express\" people. They drive by express, they walk by express when the steam is up, they count their bills by express, drink by express, and, according to the opinion of the Hon. M. P. for Dundee (Scot), they eat and spit by express. We say they drink by express; for whoever saw an American sit down and spend half an hour or more over his pint of beer or gill of whisky ? No, that is decidedly too slow. He stands at the bar of the saloon, and after the \" cock tail,\" or \" gin sling,\" or brandy and water is placed before him, the bottom of the tumbler is reached at one operation. There is no sitting and \" fuddling\" over the drink, as a genera] rule. Down it goes at a mouthful, and off he starts to some thing or somewhere else. We have met many intelligent men, who deplore that fast working of the brain which is so prevalent. One consequence is, such people do not live to enjoy the robust health they might otherwise do. Our remarks apply, of course, more particularly to men engaged in all sorts of business in the large cities. Some farmers, and many who live in the coun try, may be seen, actually, one would suppose, trying how long a time they would take to do nothing ; whilst others, again, who have made a small independency, are satisfied to let the world wag as it likes \u2014 they purpose enjoying it, and its comforts and blessings, by taking things easy. In the rural districts as good specimens in that respect are to be seen as in Farmer Giles, of Devonshire or Buckingham (Eng.). \" Express companies,\" however, form a different feature of American commercial life, and which we may here notice. EXPRESS COMPANIES. The great carriers \u2014 such as Pickford. Chaplin & Horne, and Carver <fe Co., of England \u2014 assume the title of \" Express Companies\" in America \u2014 who send all their goods by \" ex press,\" as it is called. The heavy goods, to a great extent, are consigned to the railway companies, who for ward them per \" express freight\" cars, which are proverbially slow in their speed, com paratively \u2014 so much so, that unless for very heavy articles, the great bulk of the goods sent over the country are consigned to the care of express companies. Some of these companies \u2014 in the large cities \u2014 partake of the character of the \" parcels delivery company\" of London, not extending their operations out of the city. Whereas the larger express companies extend their business, by agencies, over the entire United States to California, as well as throughout all Canada. With every express train, they have either half of a car, or an entire car, devoted to the goods they are conveying. They send a special messenger with each. At the other end of the same car, is generally the U. S. Mail, under charge of the mail guard. In the express companies' portion of the car, the messenger who has charge of the packages, delivers them out at their respective stations, and receives others to forward onward. A large and strong wooden box, and sometimes an iron safe, travels along with him, in which is deposited all letters, small and valuable packages, money-parcels, etc. They undertake the delivery of money and goods in any portion of America nearly. If you wish to send $ 100 in money, to a man at Chicago, for example, you put it in an en velope\u2014give into the express office \u2014 and they undertake to deliver the package, although in their receipt, they do not acknowledge to have received that amount, but merely a par cel, \" said to contain such.\" There are three or four companies who absorb the greater"], [347, "EXPRESS COMPANIES \u2014 WINTER TIME. 57 portion of the trade, and one can scarcely credit the magnitude of their operations. Great as such a concern, as Pickford & Co.'s is, in Britain, it actually becomes a second-rate car rying concern, vhen compared with the chief express carrying company here. One of these express companies, last October, opened, by contract, the great Pacific overland route from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, joining St. Louis (Missouri) with San Francisco (California), an overland journey of 25 days, with relays of horses at every few miles, and forcing a passage through the Rocky Mountains, carrying mails, treasure, goods, and passengers, not, however, without danger from the troublesome Indians on the route. Next to laying the ocean telegraph, it is the greatest achievement which has been accomplished for many years. It is more than probable, that all that line of road, will be shortly \" located,\" wherever found suitable for settlement. In every arrival, for example, from California, thousands of dollars in specie, notes, etc., are consigned to their care by merchants and bankers there, for delivery to parties in New York and other cities in the east, and which is received and paid over with the greatest regularity. These companies, therefore, engross a very large amount of business, which the railroad companies would have to attend to; but, with the express company, the rail road company has only one account to keep, instead of thousands. In the delivery of goods several hundreds of miles off not beiog so expeditious as that experienced in Great Britain, the cause is attributable to the transit over the railroads, and not to the express companies, as their arrangements for expediting the forwarding of goods, so far as they are concerned, are most systematic and extensive. WINTER IN AMERICA. Residents in Great Britain are, we think, too apt to fancy that the people in the United States and Canada, with the thermometer at 20 below zero sometimes, must dress some thing after the fashion of Laplanders, never be away from the fireside, and such as are to be pitied in a country, with nothing but fields of snow and rocks of ice on every side. To the poor man, who has not a sufficiency of warm clothing, fuel, and food, there is no doubt but that he feels acutely the swinter in all its severity ; and more so than he does in Britain. The man, however, who can wrap himself well up when he goes out, and has food and fuel enough to keep him warm in doors, the winter presents to him even greater attractions than any other time of the year. SLEIGH DRIVING. Then that well-known gentleman, \" Paterfamilias,\" the merchant, rigs out his sleigh or \" cutter,\" as it is called, which has been idle for 9 months, gets on the harness, with all the paraphernalia of bells, etc., on his favourite \"tit,\" yokes him, and with wife and children all seated cozily in their furs \u2014 robes of buffalo skins \u2014 and \" dreadnoughts,\" start off for a drive, with the sun shining from a cloudless sky over their heads. The bracing air tells upon man and beast, and what with that, the rattling of bells, and every one driving as if on the road to the Derby, the scene on the public streets is exciting beyond supposition. There goes Paterfamilias bowling along, with a keen north wind blowing in his face, when up comes behind him, rattling along with another lot of bells \u2014 and in a twinkling, passing within an inch of his horse's nose \u2014 a pretty little sleigh drawn by a couple of bay spank ing beauties, driven by, perhaps, another in human form, with a lady companion at her side. Old paterfamilias \u2014 fond as he is here of a bit of fast horse flesh \u2014 has too heavy a cargo on board, bo that he has no chance with the fair damsels, whose occasional pitching up and down, and skilful use of the whip and ribbands, go ringing, rattling, and bounding along, the \" observed of all observers.\" By-and-by, up comes another pair of Morgan greys, slashing along, making the snow fly from their heels, also driven by a lady, who, with a gentleman at her left side, are now bent upon disputing the right of road \u2014 at all events, as regards speed \u2014 with the two lady friends and the bays before them. Now they"], [348, "58 WINTER TIME IN AMERICA. are abreast of each other. The horses understand what is to be up, so, without many words from their fair drivers, off they set to test their powers at \" 2.40\" work \u2014 ringing and jolting \u2014 with the 2 little bays stepping out to double-quick time, with a fair and square good English step, whilst the greys go thundering along, rolling about in true \" racker\" style, with their big Morgan heads nodding up and down as they go. There is a \" clear stage and no favour\" then. At it they go. There the ladies sit, with a rein firmly held in each hand ; they get excited, the horses are at it full swing, and thus they bowl along till the Morgans prove rather strong and long in the limbs for the bays, and, after a most exciting contest, they pass their gallant and pretty competitors, and with a merry and graceful lift of tbe whip handle, by way of salute, the lady drivers part com pany, till some other party drives up to them with whom they may renew the race. In all the excellent broad streets with which America abounds, lady drivers, gent drivers, sleighs with 1 horse and Bleighs with 16 horses, are to be Been; and what with hallooing, shouting, ringing of bells, cracking of whips, snowballing as they go, and, perhaps, an up set now and then, by way of a change, who will say that such people are to be pitied in winter time. If they do not indulge in Scotia's \" roaring game,\" they have, we are bound to think, all the excitement of it. After the drive, what with the excitement and oxygen they have imbibed from the pure air, they return home for the day, with a famous appetite for dinner, and in excellent trim for the reunion at friend Jones's in the evening. WINTER EVENINGS. In the winter evenings, more particularly close after New Years' Day, balls and par ties, of one sort and another, follow in quick succession. Then the dry goods importer is careless about the solitary case which ba3 got out by the last steamer, although it should not be opened for a week at least ; the agent for the go-ahead manufacturing company, whose headquarters' are at New England, cannot mend the trade, there being no buyers, so he is at ease with himself and the world in general ; the bank teller is not harassed and pestered with such lots of \" shinplasters\" and \" uneurrent,\" or \" broken bank\" bills be ing thrust across the counter to him ; the exchange broker can scarcely get a nibble of a shave, however small \u2014 each and all making short work of their business for the day ; and as for the captain of the river or lake 6teamer, he has been laid up for a month, and will be for other 2 months, so that all parties are then inclined \u2014 having little else to do\u2014 to go hunting up old friends and making new ones, giving and accepting invitations to the nu merous and pleasant little family meetings, which form so large and so pleasant portions of the winter evenings in American society, where the piano, the melodeon, the guitar, or the violin lend their assistance in one room, whilst the chessboard, or a game at penny whist, or \" eukre\" is being played in another, and thus, in a round of evenings spent mer rily and happily, do the people pass the evenings inside the house, whilst the Etarry heavens above proclaim a dry and rarified atmosphere, unknown almost in Great Britain. If the winter is thus a scene of gayety and mirth in the large cities, it is doubly import ant to the farmer and the country store-keepers. When the country is covered with snow, then the farmer loads his sleigh, and drives over fields and roads in as straight a line as he can, the whole country affording him a road in any direction where cleared. Thus laden with poultry, and all sorts of farm produce, he reaches the nearest town, and converts these into cash, or barters them for articles of domestic use, with which he returns horne loaded. By this means, the whole country is opened up, every one finding a highway for himself. The trade of the country towns is naturally very much increased, and then the heart of the country store-keeper is light when he is doieg the best part of the whole year's trade. In some of the more northerly portions of Canada the winters are very long, but all the time the farmers are not idle, as may be supposed, but busy in burning brushwood, and other work they had partly pre-"], [349, "WINTER TIME \u2014 AMUSEMENTS AND SPORTS. 59 pared during the summer months. As the weather decreases in severity, and spring be gins to open up, then the farmer gets his seed into the ground, as soon as it is prepared, and although that may be far on in the year, compared with the seed-time of Great Britain, j et the seed is brought forward with extraordinary rapidity, arising from the moisture the ground has received, and the great heat of the sun, which then enables the farmer to turn his attention to other things. The farm produce brought into towns in winter, in the shape of poultry, etc., are all frozen as hard as ice itself, and in that condition they keep a long time quite fresh, so that large quantities of such are brought in that state, and kept in ice for months. When about to be used, all that is necessary is to place them in cold water, which at once reduces them to a proper temperature for cooking. Winter time in America, therefore, is looked forward to, by almost every one, with very different feelings from what many in Great Britain are apt to suppose. In the months of November and December, generally, there is little of that raw, damp, cold, muggy weather, so much experienced in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland. In stead of that, the sun beams forth in all his splendour, with, perhaps, a cold but dry and pure atmosphere, then termed the Indian summer part of the year, a time more enjoyed than any other by strangers from Great Britain. AMUSEMENTS AND SPORTS. If horse racing can boast of being one of England's greatest national sports, that of trot ting matches with horses in harness, may be said to be one of the great sports of America. There is, however, no great day as a \" Derby day\" of such interest as that day is with Englishmen, when it 6ets aside the more important duties of business, and even parliament itself. True, the Americans have a greater holiday, because more universal, viz., the cele bration of Independence day (4th July), but that is of a totaly different character, being one of jubilee and rejoicing. Last year, the turf appeared to be making a little more headway, and the steam is to be tried to be got up to a point in future, when the \" fashion course\" of New York is expect ed, some day, to rival that of Doncaster, Epsom, or Goodwood. A popular expressed wish seems to be that some English blood horses should be brought over to try their metal on American soil, in return for the importation into England of \" Prioress,\" and her com patriots, on the English fields of horse racing. If the Americans cannot boast of such races as those of England, their trotting matches, and trotting horses, are, in our opinion far ahead of any thing of that kind in Great Britain, To give the British reader an idea of how a horse is yoked, equipped, and driven in a trotting match, we give an illustration of one in full swing at fully \" two forty.\" The machine drawn, is built very light, yet as strong as there is occasion for, with seat only sufficient for the driver. It will be seen that the horse is attired in a very light suit of harness, which, with the machine, or \" buggy,\" presents a very slim appearance. Those horses, generally, have a peculiar gait, called \" racking,\" hence they are called \" rackers,\" or \" pacing horses.\" The \" racking,\" or trotting motion of the horse, is not the throwing of the body and legs of the animal straightforward, but a sort of rolling about motion, and, when going slowly, partakes of the appearance of a fast walk and a slow trot combined. It is a peculiar motion, and not a handsome action of the horse, according to our ideas. On the saddle, however, we are told that the motion is particularly easy for the rider, and that many lady equestrians prefer a good \" pacer,\" or \" racker,\" to any other sort of horse, on that account. It is the ambition of many who keep horses, to be able to boast of how few minutes they will take to trot one mile. Those who can trot 1 mile in 2 minutes and 40 seconds are considered up to the mark as \" fast\" horses. From this has arisen the common remark of \" 2.40,\" when applied to any thing which is done fast. Thus they have 2.40 men, 2.40"], [350, "AN AMERICAN \" RACKMER\" AT FULLY \" TWO FORTY.\""], [351, "TROTTING MATCHES \u2014 BILLIARDS AND CHESS. 61 women, 2.40 steamboats, 2.40 workmen, same as there are 2.40 horses, and if we can be lieve one common idea in England, it is that all America, every thing in it, and which is done in it, is 2.40. These trotting matches, generally, consist of matches of one, two, or four horses, and are just as exciting to the American, as a horse race, when ridden by jockies, is to an Englishman. The time for trotting is sometimes 2.31, and 2.32 for 1 mile. Tlie breed of horses considered the best trotters, are called the Morgan breed, with big, unseemly heads; and are large-boned, and long-limbed horses. They trot along at a fear ful pace, and as they pass, you are apt to expect to see the whole machine fly into a thou sand pieces; but no, it whirls along over the ground, as if it was a feather at the tail of the horse, the driver seeming to sit on nothing. To our ideas of driving the driver will be seen holding his arms very far out, and much further than English drivers, we think, are accustomed to do, but we understand it is for the purpose of giving them as much \" purchase,\" or power over the horse\u2014 some of the Morgan horse, being very \"hard in the mouth,\" and strong in the head to guide\u2014 when they get excited in the game they are playing. As drivers, we should be inclined to say, the Americans, as a people, have no superior, if any equal, in the world. When little boys, and able to hold the reins, they will be seen stuck in between the knees of the parent, and driving along with great ex pertness, until they will be met with alone, or, perhaps, two together in a buggy, and try ing the metal of their horse at \" two forty\" work, with all the relish and skill of men, and thus, in time, become excellent hands at handling the reins. Many ladies drive regularly, and in Cleveland, and some of the western cities, we saw some excellent \" whips\" amongst them. We may here remark, that in some cities of America, horse exercise is a good deal adopt ed by ladies, and in one part of the country a lady teacher advertises as engaged in giving lessons, with many excellent reasons why it should be more practised by ladies than it is. Cricket is not engaged so much in as in England, but \" base-ball \" and \" quoits\" are very much played. .The great pastimes \u2014 as games or amusements \u2014 however, are in-doors, and those are the sci entific games of billiards and chess, but more particularly the former. Large as some of the billiard rooms in London are, they are only a few in number com paratively, which are fitted up in that style of magnificence which characterize the bil liard rooms of such as New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Buffalo. In these cities, the number of billiard tables is almost incredible. At night, the lager beer saloons of the Germans are filled by men playing \u2014 and few there are but what has its billiard table \u2014 even the very meanest-looking places have one. It is the great game with the German people, and hence its great enjoyment with them. In billiard rooms in Cincinnati we have counted 16, 18, and 20 tables in one establishment, whilst the billiard rooms of the cele brated player \u2014 M. Phelan, in New York \u2014 are fitted up with 30 magnificent tables, all of the .manufacture of O'Connor & Collinder, the largest billiard table makers in America. Mr. Phelan's rooms night after night, are thronged with gentlemen enjoying this game. Markers and attendants wait on each table, and altogether it appears an exceedingly well conducted establishment In America, the playing of billiards is rendered more respecta ble than it'is in England. If it is right for billiards to be played in hotels and club-houses, and there conducted respectably \u2014 the game has extended itself amongst the people, and forms one of the greatest enjoyments of city life after business hours \u2014 and from all we could 6ee and hear of it, throughout the country, it is conducted as one of the respectable and healthy recreations of the people \u2014 but, of course, like every thing else, liable to abuse. There is not a young man scarce]}' to be met with, but who understands the game, and who can play at billiards. The apartments of billiard rooms are generally large rooms or halls \u25a0well ventilated and comfortably fitted up, both for the looker on and the player. In the autumn, or \" fall,\" must be mentioned the \" target excursions,\" as they may be termed \u2014 although an amusement of a decidedly practical character. From about the com mencement of October, up till the end of November, never a day passes almost but what"], [352, "62 DEGENERACY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. a small regiment of the employees of some large manufacturing or commercial establish ment will be seen parading through the streets in military uniform, on their way to some part of the suburbs \u2014 preceded by an excellent brass band, with invariably a coloured attendant carrying the target in the rear, and the invited guests carrying the gold or silver articles as prizes, which are to be shot for\u2014 those going nearest the bull's eye obtaining prizes respectively for their skill. Parties of this eort, are to be seen numbering from fifty to hundreds, depending upon the size of the establishment or association. In general, they are all neatly dressed in uniform, and with their muskets \u2014 with fixed bayonets, shoulder high, present a decidedly military appearance. Previous, however, to their going out on 6uch excursions, they are regularly drilled in the use of fire-arms by a military official, and the target excursion may be said to be the review day \u2014 when each is called upon to attest his proficiency in the art of handling a musket, and in being a good marksman. They start off in the morning and spend the day in this manner, dine at some appointed house, where dinner has been prepared for them, and return home in the evening. In this way are the great majority of the male population proficient, to a certain extent, in the art of war \u2014 so that in case of emergency, an immense force of citizen soldiery can be calculated upon. THE DEGENERACY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. Amongst the many popular errors entertained in Great Britain respecting America and the American people, we find we must include that which has been promulgated in certain quarters, as to the decay or degeneracy of the Americans, in their physical strength and condition as a people. We confess that until we had visited the country, we were some what of a similar opinion. From what we have seen of the people, however, over a wide extent of country, we are led to a different conclusion. We think the error has crept into British minds from the fact, that almost the only op portunity they have of judging of the American people, is from what they see of them in the samples of Americans who visit Great Britain \u2014 as merchants, bankers, dry goods or hardware storekeepers \u2014 as buyers or sellers. There is no other opportunity of judging of them otherwise, excepting by coming over and travelling through different districts of the country. To take, therefore, the sample of Americans from the close, confined counting houses of New York or Boston, as fair samples of a whole people, covering such a conti nent as this, is, we think, hasty and erroneous. As well, in our opinion, may we take the people of such as Hampshire, in the south of England, and declare that they are fair sam ples of the British people \u2014 when the size of their heads and breadth between their shoul ders has only to be compared with those of the natives of Aberdeenshire, (Scotland,) or as a whole, with the stalwart Highlanders of Scotland, or the natives of Cumberland, (Eng.) to see the difference. Just as well, also, may we say that the hard-worked entry-desk clerk in a dry-goods warehouse in Wood street, or a banker's clerk in Lombard street, London, with their bleached faces aud slender forms, are fair samples of, and the very personification of John Bull himself. We cannot take, therefore, the commercial classes of the New England States or New York, and say that they are fair samples of the American people \u2014 whilst it is well known that the tall, big-boned native of Kentucky exhibits as great a difference from such, as there is in the cases we have cited as regards the British. If we are to take the descendants of Eu ropeans as comprising the population of America \u2014 and we cannot do otherwise, as we are not treating of the aborigines of America \u2014 we ask, do the hundreds of thousands of the children of Germans, who form so large a portion of the population of America, look like a people running to decay ? Or, again, do the hardy sons of Scotland, scattered all over America and Canada, bear out the truth of such a conclusion 1 We are aware that there are local causes \u2014 such as fever and ague \u2014 and that the extreme heat and cold has an ener vating effect for a time on the constitution ; but with proper care, and avoiding the causes"], [353, "63 DEGENERACY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. of such local diseases, the constitution of the European stands as healthy now, under the purer atmosphere of America, than ever it did amid, we think, the still more trying cli mate of Great Britain, when taken as a whole. We may be met with the remark, that the American people do not look so fresh and healthy-looking, and so fat as those who enjoy the roast beef of old England, with their \" stout\" and beer after dinner to their hearts' content. All we can say is, that both in Canada, and the northern and western States of Ameri ca, we have found as fresh and healthy-looking, and as strong men as ever we met in Bri tain. We will admit, however, that the rosy colour on the cheek is not to be 6een to such an extent in America as in the country districts of Great Britain or Ireland, nor that the people, as a whole, are so fat and Btout-iooking. But in reality, that does not matter so much of itself. What is wanted to constitute health and strength, is not by eating- enor mously, and drinking porter, and being fat. What is wanted in a people is bone and mus cle, and we feel convinced that more muscle and real strength, and health, also, is to be found in the wiry frames of the moderately fat \u2014 or even in the thin timbers of an active and healthy constitution \u2014 than in the extraordinary fat individual, as we presume it will be admitted, that fat forms a very small part in constituting the strength or enduring quali ties of any animal, but rather an impediment to healthy action. If proof is needed of onr remarks, we refer no further than to the agility and strength, and health of the North American Indian hunters, who, to look at them closely, show none of that superabundant fat, or size, we are apt to give them credit for, and yet we will be bound to say, that for enduring fatigue \u2014 half shattered as their constitutions have been during many years with the whisky of the white man \u2014 they will equal any average samples of British strength. We may here observe, that having bad an opportunity of meeting with about 40 repre sentatives, or chiefs of tribes of North American Indians, last summer, on their way from Washington to their territories beyond Minnesota, we remarked, particularly, the small but nimble foot and leg of these men, some of them over 60 years of age, but moving along with all the agility of men of 20 or 30 years of age. They were, one and all, liter ally skin, muscle and bone, and in that respect, rather upset our previous notions of what we expected to find amongst them. The great mistake, we think, seems to be, that Americans are looked upon as weak in constitution and strength, simply because they are not so blown up, and of such portly di mensions as John Bull and his associates are represented to be. But if expertness, or agility and strength, are the essentials required, we have no hesitation in saying that as great an amount of these qualities will be found throughout America, as a whole, as in any part, either of Great Britain, or probably, in the world. Looking at the matter in the aggregate, therefore, we think that the very fact of what has been done in the country \u2014 the immense strides it has made, with comparatively little money at command \u2014 the extensive tracts of forest converted into fields of waving grain, or pasture \u2014 the enormous cities they have reared \u2014 the roads they have made \u2014 and in com paratively so short a period, speaks volumes for the physical energy of the people. It may be that the brains of commercial men in America, are overworked, perhaDs more than they are in London, for instance \u2014 although we doubt it \u2014 and that they su physically, in consequence ; but it is folly, we think, therefore, to say, that the whole peo ple of America are degenerating, simply because a few merchants in their hurry to get rich, fritter away body as well as mind in the operation. Whoever sees an American thoroughly alive at his business, and having manual labour to perform, whether that is packing a bale of goods, chopping down a tree, swinging a tilt hammer overhead, or, above all, going to a fire, or working a fire-engine, will see nei ther the want of will, nor want of power to do it. If he can invent a machine to do it for him, he will do so fast enough, and quite right, too, to make machinery work as much as possible for him. As connected with this subject in some degree, we would refer to the excellent practice kept up by many of the Scotch portion of the population in keeping up their national"], [354, "64 DECLARATION OF INTENTIONS. games wherever practicable, and whoever witnessed the Scottish games held in Jones's wood, New York, last September, will say, they never saw the \" caber tossed\" or the \u2022' Highland sling\" danced, or the \" putting of the stone,\" executed with greater agility or strength on the sides of Kinloch Rannoch, or even Braemar. It may be that in out-door sports the Americans would be all the better, if they had even more holidays than they have, where games and gymnastic exercises were encour aged and indulged in, so as to improve their physical strength. In that respect, however, we believe they are quite alive to the importance of such. DECLARATION OF INTENTIONS. The emigrant who arrives in the United States with the view of becoming a permanent settler, and who wishes to enjoy all the privileges of native-born citizens, must go through the form of what is called the \" Declaration of Intentions,\" as well as be a resident in the country for 5 years. The law requires such, before a vote at elections is extended to for eigners \u2014 and also to entitle them to bequeath real estate property. The intention to be come a citizen must be notified at least 2 years before the naturalization papers are ob tained, or, in fact, before the applicant becomes a naturalized citizen. The declaration of such intentions can be made before any state court, being a court of record, and having a seal and clerk, and common law jurisdiction ; before a circuit court, or district court of the United States ; or before a clerk of either of these courts. In New York, the office for declaration of intentions is situated in the City Hall, at the public park. On going there, the emigrant will see a board up with \" Naturalization Of fice\" painted upon it. On entering the office, and stating that he wishes to declare his inten tions, he is asked where he comes from, his name, age, etc. All such particulars are en tered in a book, which states that on a particular day he has declared his intentions of be coming a citizen of the United States. That book, with such declaration, is handed to the applicant to _ign. That being done, the clerk makes out a document, of which we give a copy, so that parties from Great Britain and Ireland may be aware of the terms upon which they are to expect the privilege they ask for. The document referred to reads thus : \u2014 (Copy.) STATE OF NEW YORK. In the Court of Common Pleas, for the City and County of New York : I, A. B., do declare on oath, that it is bona fide my intention to become a citizen of the United States, and do renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty whatever, particularly to the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, of whom I am a subject Sworn this day of month, 185 \u2014 . [Signed,] A. B. Signed by C. D., clerk, in the clerk's office, Court of Common Pleas, for the city and county of New York. I certify that the foregoing is a true copy of an original Declaration of Intention remain ing of record in my office. In witness whereof, I have hereunto subscribed my name and affixed the seal of said court, this day of month, 185 \u2014 . Signed here by C. D., Clerk aforesaid. Previous to obtaining the above document, the applicant has to pay the fee of 25 cents. After the five years has elapsed from the day of the applicant's arrival in the country"], [355, "65 DECLARATION OF INTENTIONS. and presuming he has declared his intentions in due form as stated, he must prove by the oath of two citizens of the United States, that he has been resident for five years, and one year within the State where the court is held, before he gets his naturalization papers. We quote the following as what appears to be the law on the subject: \u2014 \" If he have been a minor, and shall have resided in the United States for three years next before attaining his majority, he may be admitted without such declaration, on prov ing by two witnesses that he has resided five years in the United States, three as a minor and two since he became of age, making the declaration of his intention at the time of his admission, and declaring on oath, and proving to the satisfaction of the court, that for three years next preceding it has been his bona fide intention to become a citizen. \" The alien's country must, at the time of his admission, be at peace with the United States. \" If an alien die after having made his declaration of intention, and before his admission, his widow and children are citizens. \"The minor children of any one duly naturalized, if dwelling in the United States, are citizens. \" A foreign married woman cannot hold property in her own name, unless she be natural ized, though she may after naturalization hold it separate and distiuct from her husband.\" The fee for obtaining the \" naturalization papers\" is 50 cents, 75 cents, or $1 (2s. 3s. or 4s.) according to the style of the getting up of the document, and ornamental printing of said papers. Whatever may have been the reason which led to the adoption of such a law, before a foreigner could hold a legal title to real estate, we should suppose that the sooner it is wiped from off the statute book of the United States the better, as, so long as it exists as it is, it presents no additional inducement for settlers to become purchasers of real estate in the country, whilst they are not placed on a footing of equality with other purchasers, simply because they happen not to have been 5 years in the country. We have no doubt this law will be repealed ere long. In fact, the subject is beginning to be \" ventilated,\" from an article we observed in the New York Daily Times of 18th Sep tember last, in which the editor says : \u2014 \" The statutes in question are not required by any considerations of public utility, and are founded upon the obsolete maxims of a by-gone age. Why should it be necessary that an alien should file with the Secretary of State a declaration of his intention to be natu ralized, before he can be authorized to take and hold real estate . Until such declaration is filed, he cannot take title to real property, either by purchase or by will. Any devise to such alien is void, and the property passes to the heirs-at-law. Now all such provisions are entirely uncalled for. They cause trouble, and, in some cases, defeat the intentions of testators. The general policy of our law is to make the acquisition of property open and full. If there is danger to our institutions from foreigners amongst us, that danger is cer tainly lessened, and not increased, by their becoming interested in the soil. We trust the legislature, at its next session, may find time to consider this subject.\""], [356, "66 AMERICAN HOUSES, AND MODES OF LIVING. AMERICAN HOUSES. The interior of the houses in the United States resemble, in many respects, the neat, clean, and tidy appearance of a well-regulated English house. The houses of the upper classes are furnished in a style of great magnificence, particu larly as regards furniture \u2014 it being universally much cheaper here than in Great Britain. All the rooms are, generally speaking, very lofty, and airy. The dining-room of the Americans is generally on the basement floor of the house, on a level with the kitchen. When the meals are announced as all ready and on the table, the family retire down stairs to the dining-room \u2014 generally a plainly furnished apartment, compared with the other rooms up-stairs. After meals they retire at once up-steirs, and use the sitting room, parlour, or drawing-room and library, as they feel inclined. It is the same after every meal. In very small houses, even, the inmates take their meals, generally, on the ground-floor also, and sit in a room up-stairs. By this means, all waiting until tables are \" covered,\" \"set,\" or \"removed,\" is avoided, besides being much more convenient for ser vants, in having no meals and dishes to carry up and down stairs. The meals generally consist very much of the same dishes and viands as in Great Britain, with a few variations in the article of fish, and additions in vegetables and bread, unknown in Grea t Britain, for example : \u2014 At breakfast and supper the Indian corn forms an excellent and favourite bread, like 6ponge cake in appearance, is very substantial, and allowed to be nutritious. It is also baked into \" pancakes\" \u2014 called \" Indian corn cakes\" \u2014 which, with the \" Buckwheat cakes\" baked in the same manner, are evidently enjoyed, from the enormous consumption there is of them, at all breakfast and tea-tables, as they are served up, plate after plate, piping hot. They are used along with butter and golden syrup, and are baked as light as possible. A breakfast or tea-table here, is considered quite as incomplete without its buckwheat, or In dian corn cakes, as a Scotch tea-table would be, without its jams, jellies, or marmalade. There are only three meals a day \u2014 breakfast, about 1 to 8, A. M. ; dinner, 12, to 1, p. n, ; and tea, (or supper, as it is called,) from 6 to 7, p. m. See our notice of hotels in America, for an idea what breakfast and supper consist of, which is a fair sample of an American table generally. As we have stated elsewhere, the almost invariable beverage appears to be cold water, with the addition of tea or coffee being supplied at dinner, in the great majority of private houses. From the abundance of various descriptions of fruits, the desserts, at the humblest dinner tables, are such as are unknown in Great Britain, excepting at the dinner-tables of tbe wealthy classes. Even at the tables of the working classes here, we have seen magnificent apples, peaches, grapes, watermelons, muskmelons, etc., which are had most seasons, com paratively speaking, for nothing ; whilst the cranberries, whortleberries, pumpkins, brain bleberries, blackberries, currants, citrons, etc., afford excellent material, and assist to make up the immense variety of pies which are to be seen on every dinner and supper-table. We may here remark, that, in other respects, the tables of the working classes, as a gen eral rule, are furnished in a manner enjoyed only by the very best paid workmen in Great Britain. In the country towns, almost all classes own the houses they reside in, it being tbe ambi tion of every working-man even, to have a house he can literally call his own, and where, with a piece of ground attached, he can raise his own vegetables, fruits, and flowers. For that reason, one does not hear rents spoken about, so much in America as in Great Britain. The houses, for the most part, excepting in the large cities, are built of wood, and al though to a stranger, accustomed to 6ee the substantial stone houses in Scotland, or brick houses in England, the wooden houses may not appear so comfortable, yet they can be made equally as comfortable as any stone house. The almost universal fuel in America, is wood. Parties supply wood as they do coals."], [357, "AMERICAN HOUSES, AND HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS. 67 It is supplied generally in logs\u2014 cut up\u2014 but requiring a man to chop it up into the proper length for use in the almost universal fire-place\u2014 the stove\u2014 which article acts the part of a kitchen-range as well, in very compact form, as with it you can bake, boil, roast, and stew, all at one time. StoveB are made all sizes, and sold with cooking-dishes, etc., complete. In some of the large cities on the seaboard, such as New York and Philadelphia, coal is used to a large extent, and is increasing every year in consumption. It is of a very hard, brittle nature, and comes chiefly from Pennsylvania. There is no smoke from this descrip tion of coal, nor almost any from the wood used \u2014 so that it is one of the things which strikes the stranger, on visiting American cities, to find the atmosphere of all as clear and pure as if there were not a fire burning in a single house. Rather a difference this, from the murky atmosphere of such as Sheffield, Birmingham, London, Manchester, and Glas gow, with an additional supply of \" blacks,\" which now and then ornament the faces, or shirt fronts of the people, as they walk along the streets 1 We may mention, that in New York, the Scotch system of building houses in floors, or \" flats,\" with one and sometimes two families living on each floor, is carried out to a small extent. Such \" lands\" are filled, for the most part, with Germans and Irish \u2014 the Scotch people appearing to prefer the small, \" self-contained\" house, where they can procure them. The pressure of the times, during the last 18 months, has compelled many to divide their houses, by sub-letting the upper portion of them, either furnished or unfurnished. In this way, there are hundreds of cases in New York, where one house contains two families, which was tenanted by only one family previous to the panic of 1857. Regarding the performance of household duties, we find that amongst the families of the mercantile classes the daughters of a family are brought up to understand what household work is, and also how to do it ; in fact they are necessitated to do it, as that \" greatest plague in life,\" a servant, here, is not always the speedy, cleanly, and bidable gentlewoman to be found in England or Scotland. There is so much ignorance and unbecoming habits on the part of the vast proportion of imported servants, that families are obliged to be able to assist themselves when left in the lurch by any sudden whim of temper or taste on the part of their \" help.\" We find that the American ladies are not only good, but quick workers, throwing all that nervous energy of character they are possessed of into their work, to get done with it as speedily as possible ; so that whether it be at sweeping out a room, squaring up a bed room, or cooking a meal, we have found them \" smart\" at their work. It is not in the nature of an American lady, no more than it is in an American gentleman, to do any thing slow. No doubt, American ladies can take their ease, and enjoy a rest on a sofa, or on one of their easy rocking chairs \u2014 particularly on a hot day, with the mercury 100\u00b0 in the shade\u2014 as well as any other lady. Again, in the matter of early rising, the American ladies, in our opinion, put many British ladies completely to the blush, in that respect. What would some of our English or Scotch ladies think of getting up at 4 or 5, a. m., in the summer season, and going to market then ? This is necessary both in Canada and the United States, as, if delayed much longer, there would be no butcher's meat to be had long after these hours. As we have said, in the families of merchants, manufacturers, etc., the daughters are taught to work in good earnest, and some of the little girls of 8 and 10 years old will be found quite as smart as the boys of those years are generally acknowledged to be. Ladies who board at hotels are, perhaps, the only exception to what we have stated. The lady who is a permanent boarder at a hotel has, of course, nothing to do with the cares and work of housekeeping, but, ten chances to one, if even she does not know how things ought to be done, although she is not obliged to do them. All families try to do with as few servants as possible, preferring, in many cases, to do without extra assistance, rather than pay high wages for very indifferent and troublesome \" help.\" We may here mention that many American ladies are to be found engaged in ousiness, such as the medical and literary professions, more particularly in connection with the"], [358, "68 EXPENSES OF HOUSEKEEPING. provincial newspaper press, as well as writing for magazines, periodicals, etc., whilst the daughters in most respectable families are to be found engaged at particular descriptions of work at home, for stores, so as to enable them to be all the more independent of assist ance from their parents in paying for the superior style and excellence of the dresses they wear. American ladies will and do dress well, and, to enable them to do so, work hard rather than appear in any thing approaching to \" shabby genteel.\" EXPENSES OF HOUSEKEEPING. Regarding the cost of living or housekeeping, it much depends upon the locality and the knowledge of individuals what the expenses are. In country districts, where parties raise their own butter, milk, eggs, pork, wheat, vege tables, fruits, etc., of course the expenses are infinitely lower than in the large cities. Taking New York as the most expensive standard, we may safely affirm that, taking every thing into consideration, living is not more expensive than it is in London (Eng.). To give an idea of the chief items of expenditure for housekeeping in New York, we an nex the following particulars : \u2014 Rents. \u2014 A half house and use of kitchen, from \u00a315 to \u00a340 \u2014 all depending upon situation, size, and style of house, etc. Houses may be way to find out such, is for the stranger to coi papers in all large cities, where he is almost advertised, which may suit, or he may adver be got even lower, and, of course, higher.

It is somewhat similar to camphene, and gives a light equal lo 2 good candles, for about 25 cents (or Is. stg.) per week.

Rye and Indian corn is used to a considerable extent, but oatmeal is confined to portions of Canada, and some of the New England States. Every good housewife bakes her own bread, cakes, pies, etc., and the former is raised with yeast obtained in various ways. \" Salt risings,\" \" hop yeast,\" and \" yeast cakes,\" are used in the country, and these with brewers' yeast in cities. The cooking stoves are well adapted for baking. It takes usually some time for some emigrants to relish corn-bread, and this is also the case with rye. Bread made of half rye and half corn-meal, is both sweet and nutricious, but the methods of making all these are best learned from some good cook, and the American women are always willing and ready to teach a stranger the mysteries of the kitchen, if properly re quested to do so. Every American cookery book has a large number of these receipts, but a little practical knowledge is always essential. We find the following remarks published on the subject of Indian Corn Meal, and Indian Corn Bread: \"A bushel of Indian corn contains more nutriment than a bushel of wheat. Indian corn should never be ground fine. Fine meal may be eaten when fresh ground, but it will not keep sweet. The broken oil globules become rancid and bitter. \" Corn cakes, made of meal and water, with a little salt, mixed into a stiff dough, very thoroughly, and baked on a board before a hot fire, or in a hot oven, or in little cakes on a grid dle, till entirely done, are very sweet, wholesome bread. \" Corn and wheat bread is wholesome and nutricious, and easily made \u2014 if you know how. Stir two teacupfuls of white meal in a pint of hot water for each loaf; free it of lumps, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Boil two or three potatoes, peel and slice, and mash in a pint of water, which thicken with flour until it is stiff batter, and then add half a teacupful of bakers' yeast. Tou will use about one-third as much meal, scalded as above, as you do of flour; knead the meal and yeast, and sponge, and add a little salt with the flour all together, and work it well, and mould iu pans to rise moderately, and then bake, at first, in a hot oven. This bread will be moist, and more nutricious, and more healthy than if it were all flour. \" Buckwheat cakes are improved by adding corn meal, prepared in the same way, in about the same proportion as for bread. A little wheat flour may be added to advantage. Don't let your batter over-ri3e and sour, and never use saleratus if it does. \" Corn meal pudding may be made of yellow meal, stirred into scalded skimmed milk, till as thick as gruel, and, when cool, add ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and sweetening to suit the taste, and a little fine-cut suet, and some raisins, or dried peaches, or a fine-cut apple. It should bake an hour or more, according to size. You who do not believe any thing made of corn meal can be good, will please try this recipe for a pudding.\" Bakers are numerous in the cities; but it is poor economy to purchase that kind of bread, for home-made is much healthier and cheaper. The use of alum and other drugs is as well understood in America as in Britain, although bread, generally, is made from the best flour. No people consume so many cakes, pies, tarts, preserves, etc., as the Americans, and their tables are always set with an abundance of these. This is probably owing to the ease with which the materials are procured, and the skill of the women in baking, with the facility of cooking afforded by their stoves. An industrious woman may, with ease, set a good table at 6mall expense. Large quantities of \" saleratus,\" or bi-carbonate of soda, is used in baking bread and pas- try. A description of pic-nic biscuit, called \" crackers,\" are very extensively used, and are sold for from 6 to 8 cents per lb. (Sd to id. stg.). We have failed to meet with the \"Aber nethy\" or \" Wine\" biscuits, so well known in Scotland. Wheat flour is about cents (2J<_.) per lb. Indian corn meal is about 3 cents (lid.) per lb.

The wages paid for all descriptions of servants are very high, it being one of the great characteristics of the country, that every description of labour is well paid, and even the humble washerwoman shares in the receipt of good pay, compared with what is paid to such in Britain. In New York, such women receive 76 cts. to $1 (3s. to 4s. stg.) per day, with meals, for 10 hours' work. Giving out clothes to be washed costs, on the average, 50 cents, (2s. stg.) per dozen, and if ironed or got up, 75 cents to $ 1, (3s. to 4s. stg.) per dozen. Domestic servants are paid good wages, and although really good servants are scarce, very ordinary \" helps\" are paid from \u00a312 to \u00a320 per annum. Servants in America, for the most part, are either Irish or German, and we can assure ladies at home, that the \" greatest plagues in life\" are as abundant in America as anywhere, as on arrival here, girls who would be very civil and thankful to get \u00a34 per annum in Ireland, will be found not over clever, tidy, or tractable, when receiving $60 to $75 (\u00a312 or \u00a315) per annum. After Irish girls have been in the country for some time, they improve considerably \u2014 their ideas of themselves, and the wages they ought to receive, expanding likewise. Servants are employed differently, in some respects, from what they are in Great Britain ; for example, in first-class houses no laundresses are kept. The table and bed linen is washed by the cook, on a particular day, and the body clothes are washed by the maid of all work and housemaid on another day, of the same, or following week. PROFESSIONAL MEN IN AMERICA. In the course of our travels through the United States and Canada, we were led to make an inquiry, as to the position which professional men occupied, and the remuneration paid to them. The answer to our first enquiry so surprised us, that, from curiosity \u2014 and also to ascer tain if the answer to our first inquiry was general \u2014 we made further notes as we went along, on the same subject. As a few of these may prove interesting to many in Great Britain, we annex them for general information \u2014 young men in the learned professions there being, in many cases, as ignorant concerning matters in America, as many of their less educated brethren are. As stated elsewhere, men engaged in some of the professions, find it absolutely necessa ry to eke out an existence by acting the part of postmaster, reeve, general storekeeper, and magistrate. This applies more particularly to medical men. Fortunately for such, it"], [362, "72 CLERGYMEN IN AMERICA. is not considered, in Canada, or in country districts in the United States, infra dig, for them to exercise their abilities out of the regular path of surgery, and medicine, etc., etc. Clergymen, from their position, and the embargo which has been laid upon them in that respect, are left to exercise their ability in their own particular sphere, depending for their remuneration upon their talent, and, to some extent, upon the honour of the congre gations who employ them. \" The clergy are at a discount, in Canada, and no mistake,\" was the remark of a gentle man \u2014 whom we met there \u2014 well entitled to 6peak upon the subject. \" All the young men of promise,\" he added, \" are studying, either for medicine, or for the bar.\" \" Facts are stubborn chiels and winna ding.\" and facts and figures, moreover, bear out the assertion of our friend's observation and experience regarding the principal professions. \" The Clergy Reserve,\" as tbe grants of land originally appropriated by the Provincial Government for the support of the clergy of the Established Church of England and Scot land, as well as of the Roman Catholic Church, were called, have been commuted ; that is to say, the lands have been sold, and the proceeds have been invested in lands, the interest yielded by which is managed and administered by the several churches for the support, or, rather supplement of the clergy connected with them ; and, of course, every addition to their numbers, reduces the general dividend. We cannot, therefore, vouch for the exact stipend paid to the clergy, either of the Established Churches of England and Scotland, or of the Roman Catholic Church. The salaries of the Presbyterian ministers, except in large cities where they rise to \u00a3500, range from \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 stg. As for the paltry pit tance paid to Methodist ministers \u2014 unless we are misinformed \u2014 \u00a330, in addition to his board in the house of some family where he is temporarily located, is doled out to \" a young man without any encumbrances,\" and \u00a350 to the man who carries, like Peter, \" a wife, a sis ter,\" along with him in his itinerancy, with the addition of a consideration for every child in his family. From published documents we find that the entire staff of clergymen of all denomina tions in Canada, numbers somewhere about 2,270. Composed of as follows : \u2014 Episcopal Church, 300 ; Roman Catholic Church, between 700 and 800 ; Established Church of Scot land. 90 ; Free Church of Scotland, 150 ; United Presbyterian Church, 80 ; Wesleyan, New Connexion, Episcopal and Primitive Methodists, 600 ; Congregational, 70 ; B ptist, 180. \" The pastoral tie is a very brittle, one, in Canada, aB well as in the United States,\" is a clerical, as well as a common remark. When a congregation hear a popular minister, a meeting is summoned, a vote taken, and if he offers no objection to the salary, board is provided instanter, and the Presbytery is requested to proceed with his ordination or intro duction without delay. The process of dismission is equally summary. If he has dared to attack some social vice, or given offence, no matter how, to the \" sovereign people,\" a meeting is called, the resolution passed that Mr. 's services are no longer required, and he is accordingly, nolens volens, cashiered. Greater attention, it is true, is paid to ec clesiastical forms amongst the presbyterians in Canada, but demissions are very frequent, and perpetual change is the law that holds almost universally, which cannot excite sur prise to those who are aware that a congregational \" promise to pay\" of \u00a3100, to the min ister, on his settlement, very often dwindles down to three-quarters, or one-half of the stipulated sum before the end of the year. \" Why don't the clergy remind the people of their duty?\" an old country clergyman would say. What do our readers suppose would be the reply when thus appealed to, to remind the \" sovereign people\" of their duty ? \" Have you the impertinence to tell me to my face, in my own house, that I have not kept my word ?\" roared out one of their number, to a minister of the gospel, when the subject was complained of by a hard-working minister. \" Walk out, sir !\" and suiting the action to the word, he threw open the door. \" Walk out, sir ! my house is my castle, and I won't submit to be called a liar in my own house. Walk out, sir ! you won't long remain in connection with the church, I guess, if you try that tack 1 Walk out, sir !\" We must confess we were more astonished with tbe answer the honest minister got, than he was. Talking on ecclesiastical matters one day, a friend said, \" The Associate Reformed Congre-"], [363, "PROFESSIONAL MEN IN AMERICA. 73 gation at wished to engage the services of the Rev. Mr. , who had demitted his charge in connection with the United Presbyterian Church, but they could not come to terms, and he ultimately left his own body and accepted the offer of the congregation in connection with the Established Church of Scotland at , where he is still ex ercising the functions of the ministry.\" That was by no means a singular instance of a dissenting clergyman connecting himself either with the Established Church of England, or Scotland, both of which hold out the inducement, if not a permanent endowment at least, of the v \u25a0'_'. .a a tolerable supplement to the stipend offered by the congregation. Again we were gravely assured that you may bid \"good-bye\" to your clerical friend, a pliii.i Presbyterian, and shake hands with him on your return, hatted, gowned, and apron ed, as a pompous Bishop in full canonicals. The story goes that a Scotch clergyman, who bad undergone the above transformation, met his old friend \u2014 another Scotchman \u2014 a Pres byterian worthy, in the street, laid his hand upon the lapel of his coat, and remarked that it was rather bare for a Doctor to wear, upon which the Presbyterian took up the corner of the Bishop's apron, and twirling it in his fingers, responded, \"Very true, Johnny, man; but I wadna sell my soul for a dadle!\" (Scottice for an apron). From this it would ap pear that the new world of Her Majesty's dominions has not escaped the tainted touch of degrading simony. Such being the ecclesiastical condition of Canada, the legal and medical professions, frequently, hold out the fairest prospects of remuneration and success, and sufficiently ac counts for the fact that numbers of young men who have studied for the church, have ul timately betaken themselves to the study of law, medicine, or the practice of teaching in the common or grammar schools of the province. Barrister's fees are no less in Canada than in Great Britain, and the medical tariff is prodigiously high ; consequently, med ical men sometimes realize fortunes. It is said that the people are notorious for suing each other on the most trifling occasions, and if one may judge from the space allotted to puffing quack medicines \u2014 all of them, of course, \" Infallible Remedies\" for \" all the ills that flesh is heir to\" \u2014 in the provincial papers, John Bull, junior, appears to be as gullible as his portly papa in the old country. The same remarks apply, in a great measure, with regard to professional men ia the United States. It was only in December last we met with an instance, where a clergyman, in connection with a Presbyterian Church, in Brooklyn, New York, had commenced to sue (for balance of salary) the managers of the congregation, who had dismissed him with out assigning any particular reason. From a statement published some time ago, it appears that the salaries of some clergy men in the United States (such as Rev. H W. Beecher, and Rev. Dr. Chapin, of New York,) reach as much as $5000 (\u00a31000 stg.) per annum\u2014 and be it observed, on the \"voluntary\" principle a proof that clergymen of sterling ability are as much appreciated, and as well paid by the people in the United States, as any other quarter of the globe. Medical men in cities in the States realize largo incomes, from the high fees they charge. We have met several surgeons, who have been practitioners in England and Scotland, and who have great reason to be satisfied in having transferred their services to the United States. They are unanimous in announcing \u2014 much better fees, and fewer bad debts, than they were accustomed to in Great Britain."], [364, "74 EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

Be that as it may, the child is father of the man, and the American people are as fully conscious of the fact, as they are aware that the diffusion of general knowledge is the sole preparative for the proper exercise of the rights, as well as the performance of the duties of citizenship. And thoroughly determined as they are to perpetuate their political institutions to latest posterity, they have resolved to establish a system of common school education, well calculated to accomplish their noble and national purpose ; a brief outline of which is all that we can pretend to furnish within our narrow limits. Take the Consti tution of any State you please, you will find that it embodies an enunciation of the advan tages and objects of ed\".c_tion \u2014 provision for suitable school accommodation and furniture, as well as for the support of the teachers, the expenses of which are defrayed by revenues derive,, from lands appropriated for school purposes, and general taxation; and the devolution of the general management upon a committee of gentlemen elected by the people. We can only point to the importance attached to the selection of a healthy site for the school-room to the attention paid to ventilation, temperature, and lighting ; to the wisdom displayed in the classification of pupils, and in their courses of study, as well as in the regulations of schools and committees, and must, therefore, refer the reader to the numerous volumes, reports, and blue books professedly published to diffuse general information regarding the management of the educational institutions of America. There is a regular gradation of schools \u2014 primary, intermediate, grammar, and high schools \u2014 through which the pupil passes during the course of instruction, preliminary and preparatory, to matriculation in the college. When a child arrives at 4 years of age, he can obtain admission into the primary schools, which are generally taught by ladies, a class of teachers who \" are considered by the peo ple,\" as Miss Bremer correctly remarks in her \" Homes of the New World,\" \" as more skil ful than men in the training of early youth,\" and receive a remuneration ranging from 300 to 500 dollars per annum. If pupils have been detained by siekliness, delicate health, or by the negligence of parents, and other causes, from attendance at the primary schools for a length of time, they are sent to the \" intermediate\" schools, from both of which they are drafted on the report of satisfactory progress, at 7 years of age, into the \"grammar\" schools, where they remain under the tuition of a master, and a male and female assistant \u2014 if boys \u2014 until they are 14; and, if girls, until they have reached their 16th year. Lastly, the \" high\" schools are provided for the instruction of those who have undergone a creditable examination, and aspire to matriculation in the college ; to whose character Sir Charles Lyell bears the following high testimony : \u2014 \" The high schools of Boston, supported by the State,\" says he, in his \" Second Visit to the United States,\" \" are now so well managed, that some of my friends, who would have grudged no expense to engage for their sons the best instruction, send their boys to them, as superior to any of the private establishments supported by the rich at great cost.\" \" I was surprised to find,\" is the statement of the Hon. Mr. Baxter, M. P. for Dundee, \" that the masters of the Latin and English High Schools in Boston, get each $2400 a year, or only $100 less than the Governor of the State.\" In New York, also, we have met with gentlemen largely engaged in mercantile and manufacturing operations, who prefer sending their children to the common schools of tbe city \u2014 free, although they are \u2014 feeling convinced of their superiority to any private acade mies they are acquainted with. The enormous sum of \u00a35,000,000 sterling has been contributed by voluntary taxation for educational purposes alone throughout the United States. According to a late account 20 schools of law, 40 schools of medicine, and no fewer than 200 universities, with 12,000 matriculated students, and 700 public libraries, containing 2,500,000 volumes, have been established throughout the Union."], [365, "75 EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. A stranger, on visiting one of the public schools in any of the large cities, cannot but be struck with the excellence of the arrangements and system generally adopted. In the class-rooms of these institutions will be found the most complete attention on the part of all, the order and decorum, in all their movements, being equal in precision to that of a well-drilled regiment, as each little male and female pupil marches out or in, in regular file, to the sound of the piano, played by another young pupil of 8 or 10 years of age. There, instruction is made, as far as possible, a pleasure instead of a task, whilst it is of a character which the most fastidious could not but appreciate. We can attest to the superiority of the method by which information is conveyed, having heard scholars of 8 or 10 years of age answering questions, in mental calculations, which would put thousands of individuals, three times their age, to the blush in answering. Specimens of writing and drawing, also, we have seen equally surprising. Whilst such an excellent education is afforded to all, free, it must not be supposed that no interest is taken whether scholars attend regularly or not. If one should happen to be absent a single morning, a messenger is dispatched to the residence of the pupil to ascer tain the cause for non-attendance, whilst equal strictness is observable in the pupils' punctual attendance at the proper hours. The foregoing remarks apply to the common or public schools of the United States. In Canada the common schools are similarly conducted, and also free, so that education is brought to the very doors of the people, not only in large cities, but in every section throughout the province, and altogether the educational institutions of the province are alike creditable to the council which established, and the government that sanctioned them. Toronto is the seat of a university possessed of a talented staff of professors ; of a normal school, in which teachers receive a scientific training for their profession from efficient masters ; and, at the same time, of a model grammar and common school. The province is not only divided into counties, but is also sub-divided into townships (corresponding to a Scotch parish) and school sections, in the centre of each of which last sub-divisions a com mon school is situated and managed by a local board of trustees. Grammar schools have been established in the principal cities and towns, in which classical and mathematical in struction is communicated by a highly educated and intelligent class of teachers, in addi tion to the elementary branches of an English education, sometimes combined with natural philosophy, taught in the common schools. Both grammar and common schools are ex amined by inspectors appointed for the purpose, and the management of the system is entrusted, by the provincial gevernment, to a council of education, Rev. Dr. Ryerson at present being the general superintendent. A school-tax is levied by the trustees for the support of the teacher, from which a salary is provided ranging, in proportion to the wealth of the section and the number of the pupils, from \u00a360 or \u00a370 in the common schools, to \u00a3200 and upwards in the grammar schools; and the only defect discoverable in the system is, that dwelling-houses are not attached, as in Scotland, to the schools\u2014 a defect which will probably be removed by their erection in the course of the progressive prosperity of the province by the people. We have thus presented an outline\u2014 a meagre outline only, it is true\u2014 of the educational institutions of the United States and Canada ; institutions which, notwithstanding the diversity of sentiment that exists on political as well as ecclesiastical subjects, have been established, and are supported with cordial unanimity; from which, it must be evident to every intelligent reader, that they form at once the \"foundation of the nation's greatness,\" and a fitting theme for the children's song and prayer:\u2014 \" Then blessings on our common schools Wherever they may stand ; They are the people's colleges, The bulwark of the land. 'Tis a happy theme ; like a golden dream its memory seems to be, And I'll sing, while I have a voice or tongue, 'The Common School for me.' \""], [366, "76 ELECTIONS IN AMERICA. ELECTIONS IN AMERICA. Readers in Great Britain have, no doubt, read or heard of the Republican, or, it may be, the Democratic, or American \" Ticket,\" in connection with elections in America. Dif fering as the mode of electing members for Congress does from that of members for Par liament, we subjoin a few particulars which may prove interesting to those unacquainted with the modus operandi of voting by ballot \u2014 or popular elections in the New World. First of all, then, we may explain that there is no \" nomination day\" in connection with elections in America \u2014 but the formation of what is designated a party \"Ticket\" appears to be the same sort of proceeding, only carried out differently. The \" Ticket\" consists of a list of say, four candidates, who are nominated at a preliminary meeting of some of the leading men of the party, and decided upon as \" fit and proper persons\" to represent the party and their principles faithfully in Congress, and are submitted for the support of tlie party. For example, the Republican party, meet and fix upon their men, and have their names printed on a small slip of white paper \u2014 not much larger than a railroad ticket \u2014 issue them to all true Republicans to support, and carry the election of one out of tbe four names chosen. Only one can be elected, but four are submitted for the people's choice, as, although all Republicans, electors may have their predelictions in favour of a particular man \u2014 to any of the other three \u2014 consequently, the elector takes his choice and votes accordingly, for one man, scoring out the names of the other three, when he goes to vote. The meeting referred to, is called \u2014 the \" primary election\" \u2014 and the list of names (which may be two, three, four, or six) is termed the \" Republican Ticket' or the \" Demo cratic Ticket,\" as the case may be, the chief men in each party nominating or forming their ticket in the manner described. We may here remark, that the party ticket, properly speaking, consists of a series of tickets, representing the different offices for the Legislature of the State, as well as for members for the Congress of the United States, and that nearly all such elections take place on the same day, so that the names which comprise the Republican ticket or tickets, as a whole, include the names of different candidates for the different offices in the State Legislature, in the same manner as already described for the election of members of Congress. An elector, therefore, has to provide himself with a series of tickets, snitable, to enable him to vote for the officers of State, and, if a Republican in politics, he will in all probability provide himself with Republican tickets throughout, and vote accordingly for the man he deems the best for each office to be filled. To simplify the matter in illustration of the electoral system, we will refer more par ticularly to the election of members for Congress, the principle of election in all other offices being the same. When the Republican ticket (or list of names) is fixed upon, as already explained, the party at once set to work to secure, by every means in their power, the election of a Re publican candidate over the Democratic one. The names of the candidates may be seen a week or two previous to election day, printed on large, square banners, which are sus pended from the roofs of houses across the principal thoroughfares in the city, as a 6ort of standing advertisements of their claims for support ; so that for some time the streets pre sent rather a novel appearance, from the number and variety of the banners thus ex hibited. To keep alive the excitement, and advance the interest of the respective candidates, public meetings are held regularly, and in the open air sometimes, in the different wards of the city, which latter, present a few novel features. In the afternoon or evening, a small hustings \u2014 capable of containing from 50 to 60 persons \u2014 is erected in the street \u2014 in a square, or vacant place, convenient for the purpose. At about 8, p. m., the meeting assembles. On the hustings the friends and supporters of tbe party are to be seen. At one corner, on the platform, a pyrotechnist is placed, with a good supply of fireworks. In front, five or six large flam beaux are kept blazing. Some dozen or so of paper lanterns are hoisted on long poles,"], [367, "ELECTIONS IN AMERICA. 77 each one having printed on their sides the names of the party candidates, in whose inter est the meeting is held. On the ground, at one end of the hustings, is placed a piece of ordnance, generally about a 12 or 16 pounder, which, with the speakers on the platform, and the people in front, form the component parts of a political meeting in the City of New York. Thus \" fixed up,\" as the Americans would say, the speakers address the audience amid the smoke and glare of the burning flambeaux. Should there be disapprobation from any part of the meeting, the services of the pyrotechnist are called into play, who at once sends a few rockets whizzing up into the air. The variegated forms displayed by them as they explode, has the effect of attracting the attention of the audience, and quiet is again restored. By this means, the speaker proceeds as before, when, after a hearing for some time, another burst of opposition breaks forth\u2014 this time more powerful than previ ously\u2014the fireworks are once more put in operation, but this time with doubtful effect, when the artilleryman in charge announces a salvo of blank cartridge from his 12 or 16 pounder \u2014 the smoke and sound of which, repeated two or three times, at last Bilences the noise of all opposition, and thus again restores order. By such means the speakers are not kept waiting long until silence is restored. In this way the meeting proceeds, interrupted now and then by the dissentient part of the meeting, with other sundry displays of fire works, and a little more harmless thunder from the \" dog of war\" at hand. The excitement and interruptions alluded to, as witnessed by us at a ward open-air meeting in New York, last November, were exceedingly mild from what we expected to meet with, and nothing in comparison with the scenes we have witnessed on \" nomination\" days in England and Scotland. As we have stated, the hustings were erected in the afternoon or early in the evening, the meeting is held at 8, P. M., and by 10, or 10 30, p. M., it has separated, the hustings are taken down and cleared off, and not a vestige remained of what was a scene of excite ment, only one hour before. Each party holds its meetings, in this manner, on different evenings in the several wards of the city, and pays its own expenses. The day of election, however, arrives, and brings with it much of the quiet appearance of a Sunday morning. All the liquor stores are closed \u2014 by law \u2014 and many other places of business are not opened from choice. Men are not at work. Throughout the early part of the day, there is a feeling of dullness in many parts of the city. Towards noon, however, things begin to appear more lively. In the different wards there is a polling booth, about the doors of which are congregated a small, and apparently listless crowd of on-lookers, with, perhaps, a couple of policemen in the midst. Inside the polling booth, are stationed the \" Inspectors of Elections.\" The voter who has obtained his ticket, and scored out the names of the candidates he does not wish to vote for \u2014 leaving one name not scored out \u2014 proceeds to the polling place, and on entering is asked by the Inspectors of Elections his name, business, and ad dross, all of which is written down in the books, in the possession of the Inspectors, which being done, the voter hands his ticket folded up, to the Inspector, who deposits it in the ballot box \u2014 in the presence of the voter \u2014 no one, not even the Inspector, knowing for whom the vote has been given. Thus ends a transaction, which, in the minds of some men, amount to a sort of mysterious bugbear, but which in reality is nothing of the sort, but the performance of a privileged duty executed in an exceedingly quiet and becoming manner. The reason why the inspector deposits the ticket in the ballot-box is, that on election day there are a variety of ballot-boxes in use that day \u2014 one for every officer of State, as well as for members for Congress ; so that when the voter gives perhaps six or eight tickets into the hands of the inspector, he arranges them, and places each one in its proper ballot-box. He knows which box each ticket is for, as although the tickets are given in all folded up, yet the denomination of the office is printed on the outside of the ticket or slip of paper, whilst the names of the candidates are printed inside, and unseen by him. Thus, therefore, the ticket for member for Congress has \" Member for Congress\" printed on the outside, see-"], [368, "78 ELECTIONS IN AMERICA. ing which, the Inspector deposits it in its proper box, and so on with the ticket marked \"For Governor of State,\" or \"For Comptroller of State,\" etc., etc., into their proper ballot- boxes. We have observed, that a small crowd is generally collected about the doors of the poll ing-booths. Amongst such is recognized the \" scouts\" belonging to the opposition political party, who there watch the opportunity to challenge the vote of any one presenting a ticket who is not a voter. When a vote is challenged, the voter is sworn by the inspector of elec tions as to his having the right to vote, after which he is allowed to vote; but if it can be afterwards proved that he has sworn falsely, he is then handed over to be prosecuted for a serious misdemeanour. If it can be proved in the polling-booth that he has no right to vote, he is then, probably, handed over to the police who are in waiting. In the immediate vicinity of the polling-booths, outside, are erected two temporary offices on the pavement \u2014 one belonging to each of the two political parties. At such places elec tors are supplied with tickets, if they have not been provided beforehand with them. The scenes which take place on election days in some of the wards in the city of New York are dangerous as well as disgraceful. These occur in some of the most rowdy or lowest wards in the city \u2014 where it is a notorious fact, the Irish largely predominate, and to whom are attributed many of the riots which occur, and which sometimes terminate fatally. Whatever may be said, however, of elections in America, and voting by ballot there, in general, it is well that we should remember the working of the boasted electoral Bystem enjoyed by the \"free and independent electors\" of Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 more par ticularly in the \" pocket boroughs\" in England, the manufacture of \" faggot votes\" in Scot land, and where hoDesty in open voting in Ireland, is often followTed by agrarian despotism and outrage. And when we hear also of riots, and the free use of revolvers in some of the rowdy wards in the city of New York, we should recollect that these wards, all pat together, form only, after all, a mere atom of sand on the great electoral shores of the vast continent of America. Readers who are in the habit of measuring their standard of electoral affairs in America commit a grave error in taking their cue from what passes in the city of New York in con nection with such matters ; and disgraceful as the scenes are even there, we question if they are excelled by what passes in manufacturing districts even in England, where the \" bottling up\" system is carried ont occasionally under the auspices of some cotton, woolen> or worsted lord, where his workmen, or those of his committee, are engaged to play the part of ruffians in securing the votes of needy or imbecile voters by the basest of means ; where voters are held as prisoners in their own homes on the night of nomination day, and there filled drunk to overflowing, or forcibly bundled off in cabs to the head-quarters of the elec tioneering camp, where the \" bottled-up voters\" are congregated like a herd of hogs ready for the butcher, and where, between the fumes of tobacco and the immoderate use of intox icating driDks, they are secured, and half poisoned (and sometimes wholly poisoned) with liquor, and next morning, or election day, driven in cabs to the polling-booths to register their names in favour of a particular candidate, unless it be that they are considered not al together \" good men and true\" by the previous night's debauch, \u2014 in that case they are driven off to the country for an airing, in the charge of keepers, till after the polling-booths close at 4, p. M. As well may we, with truth, apply the \" bottling\" system as applicable to all the elec tions in Great Britain and Ireland, as we may those of brawling and riotous voters in New York to the elections all over America. With all their faults, we believe that the Americans in general display a spirit of inde pendence, and require the protection of the ballot a great deal less than it is required in Great Britain and Ireland, and that they are, in general, above demoralizing influences, such as tbe \" bottling up\" system referred to, and that the American workmen who enjoy the franchise, will not be bo easily bought over, by either the bland smiles or the hypocrit ical despotism of an employer, and who, in the exercise of their electoral privilege, act a"], [369, "ELECTIONS IN AMERICA \u2014 THE SHAKERS. 79 more manly and independent part compared to shopkeepers in country towns in Britain, who, in tendering their votes, act only the part of a sort of door-mat, foot-stool, or lackey to the influential lord of the manor, or it may be to the manufacturing lord of the village, whose chief qualifications for a seat in the House of Commons are frequently only a heavy purse and local influence, by means of which alone, such have been known \u2014 however un popular to the people \u2014 to succeed in defeating some of the most accomplished, popular, and valued of British statesmen. We selected New York as the place where we should see the system of electing by bal lot carried out under the most disadvantageous circumstances, and, so far as our experience goes, we felt somewhat agreeably disappointed that it did not turn out more in accordance with our previous erroneous ideas of the matter, and pleased that it is conducted in a man ner, upon the whole, vastly superior to the open voting system of Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 where bribery and intimidation, in innumerable instances, defeat the ends of honesty and fair play. THE SHAKERS. \"Shaker seeds and herbs,\" and \"Shaker flannels,\" are amongst the multifarious signs exhibited at doors, and in tho windows of retail stores throughout the United States \u2014 the excellence of these articles, as sold by a Bection of the Society of Friends in America \u2014 gen erally known as \" The Shakers\" \u2014 having rendered them famous throughout the country. The stranger in America who is desirous of seeing something of one of the \" Institutions\" peculiar to this country, may easily visit one of the Shaker villages when at New York, by taking the railroad, or steamboat up the Hudson, to Hudson City, 118 miles from New York, and thence for a few miles per rail to Lebanon Springs, in the County of Columbia, State of New York. In this trip, the tourist can enjoy the trip up the Hudson \u2014 visit Lebanon Springs, and the Quaker Settlement, two miles from there \u2014 the Catskill Moun tains, in the vicinity \u2014 noticed elsewhere \u2014 and all in the course of a few days, at compar atively little expense. The Society whose establishment we at present purpose noticing, reside at the Shaker village of New Lebanon, as we have said, two miles from Lebanon Springs, in a beautiful and fertile agricultural district. The village is situated on the face of a hill, and com mands a fine view of the valley in the vicinity and surrounding country. The village is exclusively tenanted by the members of the Community. Tbe principal building consists of a large Meeting-House, where the devotional exercises are conducted, and in the summer time, on Sundays, in the presence of vast numbers of strangers who are sojourn ing at the Springs. The Extract House is another of the chief buildings. In it is the La boratory, where the herbs, and tinctures from them, are pressed by means of crushing mills, vacuum pan, etc., under ;t skillful chemist, one of themselves. The estimation in which such are held, may be judged of from the fact, that in one year about 14,000 pounds' weight have been sold\u2014 the extracts of butternut and dandelion forming two of the principal ones sold. In another part of the village is the Seed House, formerly the old Meeting-House, near which is the Tannery, Dairy, and workshops where wooden-ware, door-mats, etc., are made. The Herb House, with its drying rooms, store rooms, etc., is another portion of the manufacturing premises. There, about 70 tons of herbs and roots\u2014 the produce of about 75 acres of their garden land\u2014 are pressed annually, by means of a hydraulic press of 300 tons pressure. In various parts of the building may be seen both men, women, and chil dren busily engaged in the different processes of manufacturing the articles named, or packing them up ready for market The Community at New Lebanon consist of about 500 persons, divided into eight fami lies, as they are called, each family being presided over by two elders and two elderesses, each of whom have an equal position in the management, and to whose orders the members yield perfect obedience. The management of the temporal affairs of the Society is entrusted to trustees, who are"], [370, "80 THE SHAKERS \u2014 COSTUME, ETC. elected by the ministry and elders, and who are legally in possession of all real estate belonging to the community. The chief business trustee is a Mr. Edward Fowler, a man of about 65 years of age. \u2014- ~~ j- \u2014 - \u2014 \u2014 o \u2014 The principles they profess are Christian, although their views of Christianity are pecu liar. It would take up too much of our space to go into detail respecting these; but we may briefly say that they believe the millennium has come ; that theirs is the millennial Church ; that marriage prevents people from being assimilated to the .character of Christ; that the wicked are punished only for a season ; that the judgment-day has begun in their Church being established ; and that their state of existence is the beginning of heaven. They entertain the doctrines of the spiritualists to a certain extent, and profess to have had their regular \"manifestations of the spirit\" for many years past, and that, for instance, the hymns they sing \u2014 both words and music \u2014 are revealed to them every week in time for devotional exercises on Sunday. In the Meeting-House they assemble at about half past 10 o'clock every Sunday morn ing, and, Quaker-like, the sexes are seated separately, with the men and women facing each other ; all the men, excepting the elders, being in their shirt sleeves, and wearing blue cotton and woolen trowsers and vests, with calf-skin shoes, gray stockings, and large turned down collars, as seen in figure 1 in engraving of costume. The women wear, for the most part, pure white cotton dresses, with white cotton handkerchiefs spread over their necks and shoulders, with a white lawn square tied over their heads, with boots similar in ap pearance to the high-heeled boots lately in fashion \u2014 the fashion of the time when the Society was established \u2014 and made of a light blue prunella.

The dance consists of a series of evolutions of different forms, presenting in each all the precision of well-trained pupils, moving as if with only one step. The illustration will give an idea of a backward and forward dance or march with SHAKERS' RELIGIOUS DANCE. them keeping time to the hymns they sing, at the same time, following the example, as they say, of David, when he danced before the Lord with all his might. After this, and when all the seats are replaced, and the congregation seated as before, one of the elders delivers a discourse, when the seats are removed again to give place to another dance of a different style, and to another hymn. This time the dance is of a more lively character, with the action of the arms, thrown up and down, and clapping of hands in regular order.' In this way are several hymns sung and danced to, and addresses delivered ; and however much parties, on reading the accounts of such, may be disposed to smile, no one can wit- ness the devotional exercises of these people, such as they are, without being impressed with feelings of the deepest respect and solemnity ; and however much they may differ from the Shakers in opinion, they will be ready to give them full credit for thorough conscien- tiousness, and faith in what they believe to be right Occasionally the \" spirit manifests itself\" by one or more of the congregation getting up and dancing or whirling round and round with extraordinary rapidity, and the parties apparently being perfectly unconscious of every thing passing around them. In this way will they continue to whirl and dance for nearly an hour without intermission. As may be well known, all property belonging to the Society is held in common by the members. All who join it do so voluntarily, after perusing the rules and regulations of the Society, which are submitted to all before they join. The Society is divided into three divisions, or classes, viz. : the senior, junior, and noviciate class. The senior class"], [372, "82 SHAKER SETTLEMENT, NEW LEBANON. dedicate themselves and all they are possessed of \" to the service of God and the support of the pure gospel, forever,\" after they have had time for reflection and experience. After being thus admitted as partners in the Community, the relationship is binding forever. The second class of members are those who have no families, but who, in joining the So ciety, retain the ownership of any private property they had when they entered it It i3 according to the laws that if any one leaves the Community they can take nothing with them but what they brought; that they receive no wages for the services they may have performed, and cannot recover any property they may have presented to the Community. The noviciates, again, are those who, on joining the Society, choose to Uve by themselves and retain the management of their temporal affairs in their own hands. Such are received as sisters and brothers so long as they fulfil the requirements of the Society in every other respect. Every one \u2014 male and female \u2014 works, from the preacher down to the youngest child who is able ; and not a moment of the hours of labour is occupied but by the busy and attentive performance of their duties. Throughout their workshops, meeting-houBes, dwellings, etc., the utmost order prevails, accompanied by the most scrupulous cleanliness of place and person. Although they have none of the anxieties of life, or that frightful spectre \u2014 the fear of want \u2014 ever before them, and with no personal or private ambition to carry out, yet all are willing, diligent, and faithful workers, and all appear to be cheerful, comfortable and happy. The Community at New Lebanon are, from all we can understand, a most intelligent body. They pursue the same system of education as that of the common schools of the United States, for although they lead a life of celibacy after they join the body, the children of those who come from the \" outer world\" are regularly taught and brought up in the doctrines and with the ideas of the Community, and from that source, as well as re ceiving all orphan children who are sent to them, there is a never-failing supply of schol ars. The children are dressed similarly to grown-up members. They possess an excellent library, and from the newspapers regularly received, the members are kept \" posted up\" aB to whatever is going on in the wicked world around them. Their conduct and character, from all accounts, is of the most exemplary kind, living up, in a high degree, to the principles they profess. In their relations with the world around them their business character for honour and uprightness is most undoubted, whilst the articles they manufacture stand deservedly high in public estimation, the very term \" Shaker\" being a sort of guarantee that the article is genuine. They carry on their botanical and all other operations in the most scientific manner, and have machinery of the most improved description for enabling them to produce the arti cles manufactured in the best possible manner. We may mention the somewhat singular fact, of this society, having taken root so far back as exactly one hundred years ago, in the City of Manchester (Eng.). In the year 1758, a woman named Ann Stanley, then the wife of a blacksmith, embraced the views of Shakerism from the disciples of some French religionists who held these, or similar views there, but suffering great persecution on account of her belief, she, along with a few others, emigrated to America, where she founded a Community at Niskayuna, (Watervliet,) near Albany, where the sect still have a Community. When she arrived in America, she took her maiden name of Lee, and thus the name of Mother Ann Lee is devoutly remem bered till this day by the sect, they looking upon her, as, they say, the revelation of the female nature of God to man, in the same way as The Christ was manifested in the person of Jesus, as the revelation of the male nature of God to man. During a great revival movement in 1780, large numbers joined Ann Lee's Community, and since then they have spread into different sections of the States\u2014 now numbering eighteen Communities\u2014 with a total of about 4,000 members, and affording a curious, interesting, and instructive feature in social economies."], [373, "83 FURNITURE. FURNITURE. Furniture and chair-making is in America what cotton manufacturing is in certain districts in England. The factories are upon an immense scale, equalling in size the Oxford Road Twist Mills, Manchester, or, in fact, any of the mills of Manchester or Preston, or Samuel Higginbotham and Sons' cotton mills at Glasgow (Scotland). Instead of employing girls, however, as in the cotton mills of Britain, all are men, mostly, who are employed in the furniture and chair factories in America, and chiefly Germans. In New York and Cincinnati alone, there are six or eight immense establishments in each, in \" full blast,\" and whether it is turning a bed-post, or leg of a chair, carving out some exquisite scroll work for some drawing-room piece of furniture, planing the rough lumber into the smooth table-top, or any of the other numerous matters connected with producing furniture, fit for either kitchen, bed-room, parlor or drawing-room \u2014 the saw, plane, turning lath, and mor ticing machine does all ; consequently there is not the number of hands employed which one would expect to find in one of these large mills. The great wonder is, where all the furniture goes to. Some of these factories turn out nothing but chairs, and whilst you stand looking at their great proportions, out pops a chair, newly put together on the first floor, with rope attached, and finding its way outside by pulleys, to the top floor of the mill, to be there finished off; then another and another follow in quick succession. We do not think that any people in the world beat the Americans in tbe rich and handsome fur niture they have in their houses. Mahogany is an every-day material in the better class of houses. The very doors in their lobbies and out side doors are characterized by great massiveness of expensive wood, with great expense bestowed upon carving the same, giv. ing their door-way (with outer door open and inner one shut) a most palatial appearance with the handles, bell-pull, and name plate all silver gilt Wild cherry and black walnut wood are generally used, although we have seen very little use made of the \" black birch,\" (although an American wood,) so much used in Great Britain. In connection with furniture making, we have noticed at several cities a new style of furniture, made exclusively for schools. The youngest to the oldest scholar sits in a seat \u2014 in some cases, by himself, or along with another \u2014 with a handsome little desk before him. All are fixed to the floor, so that all are obliged to keep their seats in their proper places, and there is no shaking of desks when writing, etc. We saw a school in operation, so fitted up, and could not help thinking it was a very great improvement on the old-fash ioned system of forms and long desks. Places for holding books, pens, ink, etc., are fixed to the desks. Such furniture making is carried on as a separate business in several of the cities in the United States, and amongst others, at Buffalo, State of New York, by Messrs. Chase & Son, who have established an agency for its sale in Glasgow, where samples may be seen in the warehouse of Messrs. Wylie & Lochead, Buchanan St."], [374, "84 EXEMPTION LAWS.

This is a bad provision, and endangers the collection of debts, in case of the death of the debtor. The widow is entitled to 800 dollars' worth of per sonal property, as against creditors, etc. Property taken in execution cannot be sold for les3 than two-thirds its appraised value, where the judg ment was obtained upon an open account, or upon paper, unless the paper contained the clause, to wit: \" Without any relief whatever from valuation or ap praisement laws,\" which should always be inserted. The debtor cannot waive the exemption or stay laws in a binding form. On negotiable paper, (being bills of exchange and notes payable at a chartered bank,) protested for non-payment, all parties thereto are jointly liable to suit.

This exemption is not to affect any labourers' or mechanics' lien, or mortgage, law fully obtained, which shall expressly stipulate that the homestead is liable. A mortgage or conveyance of the homestead is void unless joined by both husband and wife. The exemption descends to the surviving head of the family, or to their issue. The debtor must select his own homestead, and have it marked out, plotted, and recorded in the homestead book ; or tiie officer having an execution must have it done, and add the expenses to the writ.

BUSINESS\u2014 PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE As upon the commercial position of affairs generally depends the progress of the country, and happiness and comfort of the people, we purpose noticing here, briefly, the leading characteristics of the business done in the United States and Canada during the year 1S5 7, comparing its disasters with those of 1858, and ascertain something, if pos sible, of the future. From statistics published, we find that in 1857, throughout the entire United States, there were 4,932 failures, involving an amount of liabilities of $291,750,000, (or about __58,350,000 stg.,) against which we find that in 1858 there were 4,225 failures, with lia bilities of $95,749,662 (or about \u00a319,149,932 stg.). This shows a difference of __39,210, 068 stg., between the amount failed for in 1857 and that in 1858, but in reality nearly the whole of the amounts of both years' failures are connected with the trade of 1857, and that which was done previous to the panic which set in in October that year \u2014 the effects of which were carried into, and throughout the most part of the year 1858 \u2014 thus showing a grand total of $387,499,662, or within a trifle of seventy-seven millions and a half of pounds sterling of liabilities. The only natural conclusion is, as we have stated, that this large amount of money, has accrued nearty entirely from the panic, as it is well-known that the bona-fide trade done during the year 1858, has been characterized by the greatest caution, and there has been no business done of a speculative kind. As one of the pleasing features connected with the panic of 1857, is the undoubted fact, of an immense amount of debts due by parties with whom compromises were made, and to others, again, to whom time was granted during the pressure \u2014 having paid up in full \u2014 and even now, houses are to be found anticipating the time in paying up their dividends, and paying in full. Independent of large concerns, we believe that amongst the small er class of tradesmen the honourable and independent spirit of paying up every cent for the dollar past due, has been largely carried out, and speaks well for the confidence which is mutually exchanged between parties, which, after all, is more valuable in commercial communities, than bank bills. Eighteen hundred and fifty-eight, then, may be said to have seen the end of the great commercial disasters, which broke out first in Cincinnati in September, 1857, (in the fail ure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company,) and which has extended to very nearly every corner of the earth. No doubt but that in some districts, particularly in the large cities of the Northern and Western States, a large amount of old outstanding debts are yet to col lect, where possible ; but people now know the extent of the mischief which has been done, and are regulating accordingly. The trade of the past year, 1858, has, therefore, been the commencement of another new era in commercial affairs, and which will, no doubt, for some tune at least, exhibit more caution than was shown for 6ome years previous to the panic. That the country is already exhibiting signs of reviving health and strength in its manu facturing, agricultural and commercial departments is, undoubtedly, a cheering fact, de spite those complaints which now and then appear on the surface, when balancing the books of some of the public companies, or fast young cities in the west rising, like the excrescences, from an unhealthy body, to get cured, and thereby leaving the great parent-system sounder and healthier than before. In some of the manufacturing concerns of New England, two to three months orders are in hand for goods at present rates, and more orders refused, excepting at the market prices, when the goods are ready for delivery. In commercial circles, wholesale men are looking forward to doing a moderately large and safe trade throughout the year, as, from the manner in which all classes of store-keep ers have been running down their stocks for the last fifteen months, their shelves are com paratively bare of goods, so that an ordinary supply must be had; and judging from the"], [379, "BUSINESS \u2014 PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE. 89 indications which the spring trade already gives, there is every reason for encouragement for the future. The emigration from Europe during 1858, has fallen off very considerably compared with previous years, no doubt owing to the general stagnation of affairs, together with the in ducements hitherto held out for emigrating to the Australian colonies ; but as the policy of emigrating even there at present, i3 questionable, we have no doubt but that in the natural course of events the United States and Canada will be enjoying as large a share of European emigration as ever they have done, as, what with the banks full of idle capital, the recuperative powers of the country, the character of the people, and the favourable commercial prospects for the future, every thing bids fair to see an early revival of the time when things will be going \" ahead,\" as usual, in \" full blast.\" We invite attention to the very valuable table of statistics, drawn up by Messrs. B. Douglass <fe Co., of the Mercantile Agency, given elsewhere, in which will be found some interesting particulars in connection with the failures of 1857 and 1858. From it we ex tract the following statistics, respecting the failures in Canada : \u2014 CANADA. TOTAL NUMBER OF FAILURES FROM 1ST OF JANUARY TO 25TB DECEMBER. Number of Failures. Total Liabilities.

E 15 40 Increase of failures in Canada West in 1858. 93 Remainder of Canada East 15 22 Increase in Canada East in 1858 32 From the above it will be seen that business has been more healthy in Toronto in 1858 than in 1857, there being a decrease there of 9 failures during the 12 months just ended. Whilst throughout the other portions of Canada West, there has been an increase of 109 failures, during the same period. This may be accounted for from the fact of many of the failures in Toronto during the panic of the last 3 months of 1857 having occurred before their effects reached the country towns in the province of Canada West. In Montreal again the case is reversed, there having been 25 more failures in 1858 than there were there in 1857, owing probably to the same cause as already alluded to \u2014 that the failures, during the panic of 1857-8, were not announced in Montreal until after 1858 came in, and thus have been included in the returns for 1858. In the remainder of the province of Canada East, the number of failures, announced as being 22 in number for 1858, also shows an increase of 7 over the previous year (1857). Although these facts show, in 1858, an increase of failures in Canada West to the extent of sixty-two per cent., and in Canada East of one hundred per cent, over those of 1857, it must be borne in mind that such increase is to be entirely attributed to the effects of the great panic which set in, in October, 1857 \u2014 and that that increase more properly belongs to the trade of 1857 than that of 1858, as the trade of 1858 has been characterized by extreme caution\u2014 and what has been done, has been done safely \u2014 to a very great extent. During that time the fraudulent aud weak in business have been pretty well weeded out\u2014 and had the last wheat crop not proved to a very large extent a failure, things would have been much better throughout Canada for the last six months than they were. Business matters are now, however, upon a sound footing\u2014 the principal thing requred being good crops for the next few years in Canada\u2014 and more particularly if the crops prove short in Great Britain and Ireland\u2014 this, together with an addition to the capital of the country, is what is wanted to render things in Canada as lively and prosperous as ever they were."], [380, "90 STATISTICS OF FAILURES.

DISTANCES AND FARES FROM NEW YORK. In the following tables will be found the fares and distances \u2014 as near as can be ascer tained\u2014from New York to the principal cities and towns, more particularly in the north and north-west districts. The fares given, are first class, as well as emigrant fares per railroad all the way ; also, per railroad and steamboats, where the latter run. Although the fares from New York to the north and west, are professedly the same, by all the different routes, yet the railroad companies object to publish emigrant fares, which renders a compilation of such more than usually difficult. The fares as stated, however, we believe will be found correct, or any difference there may be, will be trifling. The summer fares are lower than those now stated. To the north and west, the following are the great leading routes: \u2014 The New York and Er_e Railroad. \u2014 (Station, West street, foot of Duane street,) extend- ing to Buffalo and Dunkirk. The Hudson River Railroad. \u2014 (Station, corner of AVarren street and College Place,) or Line of Steamers to Albany \u2014 thence the New York Central Railroad, and others, from there. The Pennsylvania Central Railroad, by way of Philadelphia and Pittsburg, one of the best made lines in the country, and through a beautiful district, now connected right through to Chicago. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, through the far-famed scenery of the Alleghany Mountains, and one of tbe finest routes which ean be taken by tourists. Parties at a loss for amount of fares to any given point, may calculate at the rate of 3 cents per mile first class, and one cent a mile for emigrant class. Strangers will observe that the fares are stated in ($) dollars, and (cts.) cents. For every dollar count 4s. Id. stg., and for every cent, one-halfpenny stg., which will give travellers from Europe an idea of i-he fares in British money. The fares in the second emigrant column, do not include meals on board the steamers on the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi rivers. Emigrants proceeding from New York, are booked at Castle Garden, or at the office 252 Canal street, near Washington street. Dist. from N. York. Raiload. First class Fares per Ruilroad.

The first class fare from Quebec to any station, per rail, is about three cents per mile. Through fares \u2014 to Montreal, $6 ; to Toronto, $16. Second class carriages are run on the Grand Trunk Railroad. Fare about two cents per mile. Fares being subject to alterations, we cannot guarantee the absolute correctness of the figures stated for the whole year, but any difference there may be will be trifling. Children under 12 years of age, half fare ; under 3 years, free. All emigrants' baggage is carried free along the railroads in Canada, whereas only 50 lbs. weight is allowed free on the lines in the United States. STEAMBOAT ROUTE ON THE ST. LAWRENCE.

In this section of our work will be found remarks specially intended for parties who think of visiting the United States or Canada, for the first time, either as tourists or as emigrant settlers. They are given in short paragraphs, for the most part, as a portion of the collected memoranda from our note-book, whilst travelling through the country, ar ranged in such order as is thought to be most convenient for the reader. A portion of what follows may not be new to some parties. The great change, however, which the whole continent of America has undergone lately, and since any similar work has been published \u2014 the great difference there is in the state of affairs now, and during the last 15 months, compared with what was in existence previous to October, 1857 \u2014 warrants the belief, that there is, at the present moment, as great necessity for recent information on the subject of emigrating to America, as well as regards all matters pertaining to the land and agriculture of the country \u2014 as ever there was at any previous period. With regard to 6ome of the opinions expressed, and advice tendered to intending emi grants, some parties may differ, and, possibly, because a more flattering account of the state of the country, either as regards the LTnited States and Canada, is not presented. Having had, however, no interest whatever but to state facts, and the unprejudiced impressions made upon our mind, we feel confidence in offering them for public perusal, more particularly as they are corroborated by the testimony of several reliable parties, who have been long residents in the country. To such as feel disappointed that we do not present a more glowing account of the coun try, and the inducements it offers for emigrants, we would say, that from the wonderful re cuperative powers which such a country as the United States is possessed of, the thorough \"go-ahead\" character of the people, the plethora of money which is at present lying idle, it cannot, in the nature of things, we think, be long before the country, m its manufactur ing, commercial, and agricultural position, presents very different features from what they do at present ; and when the country will, as in bygone years, be open to receive the sur plus of the poorly-paid and struggling artisans, from the over-crowded districts of the old world. For information regarding any particular point connected with the subjects noticed, the reader is referred to the copious index prefixed, as well as to the portion of the work on Canada."], [392, "EMIGRATION. THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT EMIGRATE. Evert year brings to this country a large number of parties \u2014 particularly men \u2014 who are no sooner here than they find out that they can get nothing to do \u2014 even in the best of times and who return home, dissatisfied with the country and all connected with it \u2014 and why ? simply because they did not take the precaution, before setting out, to ascertain what demand there was for such as them \u2014 and if there was any probability of their get ting employment if they went. We know of no class of men, to whom this applies with greater force than shopkeepers \u2014 countermen of every description \u2014 clerks ol\" all kinds \u2014 and even book-keepers, literary men, medical men, and lawyers. During the last 12 or 18 months more particularly, has this been painfully illustrated\u2014 when business has been suffering quite as much in the United States and Canada, as at home. The commercial disasters since October, 1857, have not, even yet, been got over; and during that time it has been melancholy to witness the cases of distress which has attended some of those classes on coming here \u2014 more particularly men with wives and children \u2014 who, used to the comforts of middle-class life at home \u2014 have come here \u2014 to starve in reali ty \u2014 or work at the hardest and most menial work \u2014 not always succeeding in getting even that to do. A correspondent in the London Times of July last, dating from Montreal, truthfully paints some such cases, which we could easily add to \u2014 from what has come un der our own observation. Tlie great cause of all this arises, in most instances, from the grossest ignorance of what either Canada or the United States are. We regret to say, however \u2014 in some few cases \u2014 the parties at home have no t beeh to blame \u2014 having been shamefully deceived by friends already in this country \u2014 who desired to get out their friends, some of whom might have money to invest. Even emigrants located in the United States have been, in this manner, decoyed by friends to give up good situations in some of the large cities for a life in the backwoods. One case we give as illustrative of a system. We happened to meet a Scotch family returning from Canada to Columbus, (Ohio) \u2014 who had been decoyed away in that manner, with the offer of a lot of land for nothing \u2014 but which they found to be a complete swamp. When they got there, the wife and children were nearly tormented to death with mosquitoes \u2014 no road to their shanty \u2014 no friends within a considerable distance \u2014 nothing to be bought, and many other miseries we have not repeated. The result was, that after losing somewhere about $100, (or \u00a320 stg.,) they were glad to find their way back to Columbus \u2014 buy back the articles of furniture they had disposed of \u2014 and the husband try to get another situation, in place of the one he gave up to go to Canada. Parties in Great Britain, therefore, should be cautious and see that they are not decoyed out on similar inducements. As illustrative of certain classes of trades and professions, for which there is very little chance of success in this country, we will take the case of literary men, professional men, and commercial assistants. Literary Men find it very difficult to get employment here. No doubt a man of sterling talent may get employment, but such does not require to leave England to find it. Tal ented men in that profession do not succeed here as they would like \u2014 from the fact that if they happen to be newspaper writers, they are ignorant of the state of politics, and parties in this country \u2014 which are so varied in designations and principles \u2014 and, besides, there is 60 much work done for the magazines and reviews here which the scissors accomplishes, at little cost, by operating upon the brains of British authors, in British publications \u2014 that the chances of clever literary men from Britain are poor indeed. Until a proper interna tional copyright law is in force, to protect the genius of a man who produces a useful book \u2014 in the same way as the man is protected who produces a clever machine \u2014 matters as regards literary men here will always remain as they are at present. Memcal Men, on coming to the States or Canada, find it very up-hill work for some time, consequently, in many parts of Canada and the States, the doctor finds it very necessary to perform the duties of postmaster, reeve, magistrate, and storekeeper in one. The doctor"], [393, "7 LAWYERS AND COMMERCIAL ASSISTANTS. of the \" universal genius\" order of intellect, is the most likely man to get on, and even he has to \" rough it\" for some time, before he gets a footing. At the same time, if able to hold out till he gets a practice sufficient to keep him, a properly qualified surgeon \u2014 with a diploma \u2014 coming either to the States or Canada, will succeed, more particularly as such a man as him will always be preferred to any of the host of quacks and half-educated medi cal men there are in this country. Properly qualified surgeons in the large cities make good incomes, more particularly in the States. As regards medical men, therefore, we rather leave it as a matter for each one to decide for himself as to the advisability of emigrating. We might suggest, that if doing well at home, remain there; ond if desirous of coming here, wait till \" times\" improve. Lawyer, and Lawyer's Clerks are about the last men who ought to emigrate, as the supply exceeds the demand ; besides, the laws here being different from what they have been accustomed to sharpen their wits and experiment upon at home, they would find themselves not sufficiently \"posted up,\" if they undertook a case against a rival who has been \" bred and to the manor born.\" Commercial Assistants. \u2014 Under this head we will include countermen of every description \u2014 drapery, grocery, hardware, etc., etc. Voung men, although clever in any of the whole sale or retail establishments in Great Britain or Ireland \u2014 and of however high standing in their employers' estimation \u2014 make a mistake in supposing they will get on well in America. The great reason why they will not get on here is, that the manner in which they have been bred, totally unfits them for taking a situation in a store here, excepting it may be that of a porter, as a first step. In arriving out here, with all their information and ex perience, they will find that a lad of 14 or 16 years of age will command a higher salary, and get a situation sooner here than they will ; arising from the fact, that that lad has been bred according to the requirements of a business store here, as we will explain. We will suppose you are a warehouseman, in a silk, woolen, cotton, or other department in a wholesale warehouse in London, Manchester, or Glasgow ; or that you are quite au fait as a tea taster, and can tell a Muscavado to the 16th of a farthing per lb., or a hardware man well \" posted\" in every thing, in reality, from \" a needle to an anchor\" \u2014 you know your department first-rate at home \u2014 conceive yourself up to \"tackle\" the most awkward customer without the fear of a \" swap,\" \u2014 leaving nothing to be desired, in fact, to make you a thorough salesman, either wholesale or retail. At the risk of offending your vanity, how ever, we must tell you \u2014 one great truth \u2014 that all your experience and ability will avail you nothing here \u2014 and mark, unless you know about all classes of goods, drapery, grocery, and hardware all combined \u2014 know how to make a sale in any department \u2014 make an entry properly in a day-book \u2014 post that into a ledger \u2014 draw out a bill correctly for the amount \u2014 tell what the discount should be, if necessary to be added to it, for over time\u2014 know how to nail up a box, or sew up a bale, or take a journey when wanted ; unless we say, you can do all these\u2014 and, moreover, have a ready acquaintance with the money of the coun try, its notes, gold, silver, and copper \u2014 you had better stay at home. We fancy we hear some of you saying, you don't want to come to a country where so much is required. That may be so, and depend upon it, Brother Jonathan can do without you. He trains up his boy first of all with a first-rate education\u2014 free if he likes ; after that, he sends him to what is called a commercial college, (see Commercial Colleges,) which fits him, at all events, for the counting-house, and every thing connected with money-making. After that, he finds him a situation in a general store\u2014 where they deal in a great variety of goods\u2014 he gets acquainted with all these sorts of goods\u2014 he is taught to nail up a box\u2014 asked to make an entry in the day-book or ledger, if the regular book-keeper (where they keep one) is absent\u2014 dispatched off in a hurry to the country, to overhaul a customer's affairs and books, or sent on a joiuney for a month. Such is no exaggerated statement of the business acquirements of the commercial assistant in the United States. We will now leave you to judge as to the probability of your getting a situation here, seeing the sort of young rivals you have in the field, and plenty of them, perhaps, wanting a situation like yourself."], [394, "CLERKS, ETC. \u2014 WHO OUGHT TO EMIGRATE? 8 No doubt there are many wholesale stores, who deal exclusively in one kind of goods \u2014 say drapery, for example. But here again your experience is deficient ; as, if you have been accustomed to only one class of drapery goods \u2014 and know nothing whatever of any other \u2014 you will see where you are at a disadvantage \u2014 leaving out of sight altogether the counting-house education which we have referred to. If there is one class of young men \u2014 as shop-keepers \u2014 better suited than another for emigrating to America, it is those who have served their apprenticeships in small old-fashioned merchant shops \u2014 in the provincial towns \u2014 where nearly every thing is sold, from red herring to silk velvet. All such a young man wants, is a little of the \" rust\" rubbing off him \u2014 and with an acquaintance with dollars and cents, he is the most likely man to get on here \u2014 although he, too, ought to recollect, he has got some sharp young fellows to compete against. The modern system of training young men for one department only, totally unfits them, from procuring a situa tion in any other department, even at home \u2014 far less in the United States. The case, as regards Canada, is a little different. Young men from shops at home may do better in Canada than in the States; but we would warn, most seriously, any one from going there \" on speculation.\" If your passage is paid, and a written engagement for some two or three years (long enough) you may go. Not otherwise. In Montreal, for example, a knowledge of the French language is indispensable \u2014 from the number of French Canadian wholesale and retail buyers there. Toronto and Hamilton are different in that respect. But let no one think of going to Canada, until things are very much im proved from what they have been, and are at present. Commercial travellers, on coming here, will find, if they get au engagement, that a new connection will have to be formed \u2014 the facilities for doing so here, being very differ ent from what they are at home. Like as in Britain, all wholesale assistants here are valued at what they are worth \u2014 by what amount of trade they can bring with them to their new employer. Clerks and Book-keepers. \u2014 The same remarks will apply, in a great measure, as in the foregoing. There is no doubt, but that first-class, young, and steady book-keepers \u2014 well recommended \u2014 having a thorough knowledge of American money \u2014 and how to keep ac counts by it \u2014 may get situations. We happen to know some from Great Britain who hold very responsible situations as such in the United States. They are, however, the ex ception, and not the rule. It is all right if you get a written engagement to come ont; but to come here on speculation is a very hazardous experiment. WHO OUGHT TO EMIGRATE. It may be asked \u2014 Who ought to emigrate to America? The question might be very briefly answered if we said simply \u2014 No one excepting farmers, or those who purpose be coming so, who have capital. Such is the answer at present, and it applies to both the United States and Canada. There is no branch of trade almost, but what is over supplied with hands at present \u2014 arising, as most parties may be aware, from the great depression which there has been, in every department of business, during the last 15 to 18 months. It is true, that the United States have recovered, to a great extent, from the effects of the late panic, and that that countrj7 is gradually merging into its usual vitality, and former progressive development ; but there is not, as yet, any inducement for artisans of any de scription to emigrate thither. The same remarks apply still more strongly with regard to Canada. Had it not been for the causes alluded to, we should, in all probability, have been justi fied in advising all good workmen to emigrate, with the view of improving their position, but as things are at present, we dare not do so. For agriculturalists, or all who have means to invest in the purchasing of land, matters present a very different prospect."], [395, "WHEN TO EMIGRATE \u2014 LETTERS TO BRITAIN. 9 At no time, for many years past, we believe, has America presented a better opportunity than it does at present, for investing money in the purchase of land \u2014 either uncleared, partly, or wholly cleared and cultivated. The late pressure of the times has caused great scarcity of money in the hands of landholders, consequently, large numbers of farms, in all stages of clearing, have been brought into the market for sale \u2014 whilst with those sold at sheriff's sale, which have been painfully frequent \u2014 properties have been bought for mere trifles, comparatively speaking. The wages of agricultural hands also have been very much reduced lately, and from present appearances, are likely to continue at a low figure, which, together with the low rate of wages paid for clearing, affords additional inducements for farmers with moderately large capital to purchase, 30 long as the present state of things exists, as there can be little doubt but that land will be bought cheap, if properly selected. The stranger may purchase land dear enough at present, as well as at any other time, (soe our remarks on purchasing and paying for such, in succeeding articles) ; but if judic iously selected, some very cheap cleared farms are to be picked up in even some of the best agricultural districts of both the United States and Canada. The farmer with small means, however, who thinks of emigrating to America, ought to consider well before taking so important a step \u2014 calculate all the expenses, and how much money is requisite to enable him to live during the first 12 or 18 months. That all depends upon whether he takes a free grant of land or purchases land, and if he purchases, if any, or how much of it, is cleared. In another part of this work, the reader will find full in formation on these points. To the agricultural class of settlers, we repeat, that the present time affords very great inducements to emigrate, as, in the case of purchasing land, it may be bought at much less than it has been previous to October, 1857. WHEN TO EMIGRATE So far as the season of the year is concerned, the best time partly depends upon the trade you belong to. If an agriculturist, any time between 1st of March and 1st of May\u2014 as then you will be in time for seed time, and when harvest operations will be going on, and be most likely to get engaged \u2014 but the earlier you are out the better. If mechanic, or any handicraft trade, it does not make so much difference, so that any time from 1st of April to 1st of September, will do. Considering the state of the weather merely, the months of July or August are as good as any\u2014 so far as a smooth passage is likely to be ; although September is one of the be_t months to come in, as you arrive out after the great heat of summer, and have 2 or 3 months of the \"Indian summer\"\u2014 the finest part of the whole year\u2014 before the severity of winter sets in. But each individual must be guided, to a very great extent, by the particular circum stances-of his own case\u2014 as to the best time to emigrate. The next matter we will notice as worthy the attention of parties in Great Britain, is connected with their correspondence with friends in America. LETTERS FROM BRITAIN. DIRECTED TO FRIENDS IN AMERICA. We have, no doubt, many thousands of letters written in Great Britain or Ireland to friends in the United States or Canada, which never reach their destination\u2014 there being two great causes for such, and these resting with the writers of such letters, who, doubtless, have often wondered they never received answers from their friends, whilst the carelessness, ignorance, stupidity, or bad writing of the senders was the sole cause of the disappointment"], [396, "10 ADDRESSING LETTERS TO FRIENDS IN AMERICA. to themselves and the friends they were writing to. The two great causes for letters no reaching their destination \u2014 are 1st. Indistinct and badly-written addresses. 2d. The name of the State in which the party resides not being included upon the address. Parties writing to friends in America often address their letters as if they were writing to some friend in the same country with themselves, and suppose that the post-office system is the same in America as in Great Britain. As two of the great rules \u2014 never to be forgot in writing to your friends in America \u2014 we would say \u2014 1st You cannot write too plain \u2014 or write as plain as you can \u2014 when addressing your letters. 2d. You cannot write the address too minutely \u2014 but more particularly, never forget to put on the name of the County and name of the State in which your friend lives. The first of these rules will appear all the more necessary to enable the post, office sorters \u2014 through whose hands it has to pass \u2014 to know where it is to be sent. If indistinctly writ ten, it may pass the hands of a few who can read any kind of writing almost \u2014 the next one he guesses \u2014 either right or wrong \u2014 what it is, and where it is going to \u2014 and probably the last man whose hands it gets into, cannot make it out and \u2014 throws it aside. It is then 6ent to the dead letter office at Washington \u2014 there kept for some time \u2014 there opened, and, if nothing valuable is found in it, there burned or destroyed. You will thus see that your letter may have got to Washington, and destroyed there, from your own fault at home \u2014 writing so indistinctly that every one could not read the address easily. More letters never reach their destination, however, from the address not being so full as it ought to be \u2014 but more particularly, for want of the name of the County and the State. Thus, for example, we will suppose you are writing to a friend in Madison, and you direct your letter \"Madison, America.\" Now, as there are at least a dozen places called Madison, in America, how is it possible the postmaster at New York can know which Madison you mean? Whether \"Madison, New Haven County, State of Connecticut,\" or \"Madison, Jefferson County, State of Iowa,\" about 1000 miles distant from the other; or, which of any of the other 10 places there is of the name of \" Madison,\" in all quarters of America ? You ought to recollect, that towns exist in America, of which there are from five to fif teen places, all of the same name, in different States. You may be writing to a friend at \" Washington,\" and, from the letter having nothing but \" Washington, America,\" upon it, the postmaster would very likely forward it to \" Wash ington City, District of Columbia,\" whilst you intended it to go, perhaps to \" Washington, State of Georgia,\" or \" Washington, State of North Carolina\" \u2014 or some of the other 12 \" Washingtons\" there are in America. The proper way to avoid error or delay, as far as possible, is to address your friend \u2014 putting on first, Christian name and surname, in full. Village or town, residing at, Name of county, in which that village or town is, Name of State, ending with \"United States.\" If for Canada, the same remarks apply \u2014 with equal force. In addressing there you should put Christian name and surname in full, Village or town residing at, Name of township, Name of county, ending with \" Canada West,\" Or if in Canada East \u2014 then say \" Canada East.\""], [397, "11 LETTERS FROM AMERICA AND INTRODUCTION \u2014 GOODS TO SELL. If it is too much trouble for you to write the name of the State in full, \u2014 you can put on the initials, merely, thus:instead of writing \"State of New York,\" just put \"H. Y.,\" or in stead of \"State of Illinois,\" put \"HI.\" That may do; but the name of the State in full renders it perfect \u2014 so that there can be no mistake. For \"Canada West,\" you can write \" C. W.,'' and for \" Canada East,\" write \" C. E.\" As we have said before, you cannot be too minute in yoor direction. If you do not happen to know either the name of County or State \u2014 and there happens to be more than one place in America of the same name \u2014 ten chances to one if ever your letter will reach its destination. LETTERS FROM AMERICA TO FRIENDS IN EUROPE. Parties in America, when writing to friends at home, should also be very particular in giving their friends their full address \u2014 name of village, name of county, and name of State \u2014 and tell their friends to address their letters plain, so that any one almost can read it. If they cannot write plain themselves, tell them to get some one to address their let ters for them who can write plain. Considering you are coming to a strange country, and probably know no one there, a little information on the importance of having letters of introduction to some one, already in the country, may be useful. LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION. Letters of introduction in Great Britain, for use there, are very often looked upon, as the Americans would say, as of \" not much account\" \u2014 or as \" not amounting to any thing.\" However true that may be there, it will be found different here \u2014 from the fact, if you, a stranger, in arriving either in New York, Philadelphia, Canada, or any where else, do not know any one in the city, town, or village where you are, you may find it awkward \u2014 .mid the want of a note of introduction to be a serious drawback. We will suppose you have arrived in New York, or Cincinnati, in search of a situation. You make application, and from what you say, you are in every way qualified, and a likely man lo fill the vacancy. But what evidence can you produce of your integrity, so briety, and general abilities and good conduct ? You are a stranger, you have nothing to show but testimonials which any one can get up specially \u2014 if so inclined \u2014 no friend in the town, or in America to refer to \u2014 as a party to whom you have been introduced. The most you can do, is to refer to your last employer in Great Britain, or to some houses there ; but before they could be written to and an answer got back from there, the vacancy is filled up most likely. Written testimonials from well-known houses in Great Britain are better than having nothing to show ; still we advise all to get letters of introduction to some respectable parties in this country\u2014 if at all possible\u2014 more particularly by young men and others, in quest of employment. With parties having goods to sell or samples to sell from, the case is rather different\u2014 as the goods represent themselves, and are a sufficient introduction to the man who is open to buy. Even in such cases, however, a letter of introduction, to some one in the city or town where you are, will do you no harm to have with you. With the working man, the case is different again, as he will on his statement in most cases, be rejected, or engaged on trial, to test his abilities. These are his best letters of introduction, to an employer, if he can be permitted to give evidence of what he can do. and how he can do it\u2014 together with being strictly sober, steady, and respectable. As referring to one of the many mistakes emigrants make in coming either tt> the States or Canada, we will now refer to the subject of bringing out goods to sell."], [398, "12 INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. BRINGING OUT GOODS TO SELL. No better evidence can be adduced as to the prevailing ignorance in the minds of many in Great Britain regarding this country, and what its wants are, than is shown by parties who bring out all sorts of goods to sell \u2014 imagining that by bringing them here, they can sell them to great advantage. It is one of the greatest mistakes a person ean make, generally speaking. If you should bring with you a large lot of English made woollen cloth \u2014 or any other article on which there is a heavy duty in the United States \u2014 say of perhaps 30 per cent \u2014 yon may fancy, by cheating the government here out of the dut}' payable on such, that you will make money by the transaction. Even then, however, the chances are ten to one, that you lose money after all \u2014 even although you pay no duty ; first, because you, being a stranger, would not know where to sell them to advantage \u2014 and although you did, you may bring something with you, which, whilst it might suit Scotland, England, or Ireland \u2014 will not suit America. Take the case of woollen cloths, as stated. If you brought English-made woollen cloths here, yon would find them unsaleable, from the fact, that almost every yard of woollen cloth worn in the United States, is either of German, French, or American manufacture \u2014 the fine tex ture of quality of the cloth \u2014 the manner in which it is finished \u2014 and its strength, when compared with English-made cloths, all combine to shut the English goods of that sort nearly out of this market. In this matter, as well as in many other respects, you, being a stranger here, should dabble in nothing, in this country, until you thoroughly understand its wants, the value of commodities here, and where you can buy and sell to the best ad vantage \u2014 which knowledge is only to be gained by living here a considerable length of time \u2014 and being thoroughly conversant with business in all its ramifications. Even taking goods to what is supposed to be out-of-the-way places, is equally as absurd as bringing them to the city of New York. The last case of this sort which we became acquainted with, we may mention, was the case of a young man just arrived from England \u2014 whom we met at Ottawa, in Canada West, towards which place a good many eyes have been turned for some time, as a likely point for settlers. This party brought out a miscellaneous lot of drapery goods, (\" dry goods\" as they are called,) thinking that the good folks of Ottawa were perishing for want of ladies' dresses \u2014 laces \u2014 white and brown calico \u2014 stockings, combs, etc., etc. He very soon found out his mistake, and, with a very rueful countenance, told us he had invested all his money in them, and could neither sell them wholesale nor retail. The result was, he had no alternative, but dispose of them in an auction room \u2014 which he did there, at a great loss. It may be said, he acted foolishly by selling them so \u2014 and that he should have gone into the \" bush\" \u2014 and opened a store in some new township, and he would have done well with them, and very likely made money there. We are inclined to think he made the best of them, under the circumstances. He was an entire stranger \u2014 knew no one \u2014 had not a single letter of introduction to any one throughout the whole of America. If he had brought these goods to Montreal, New York, or somewhere else, where he was known \u2014 and had made his arrangements for getting regular necessary supplies forwarded to him wherever he was \u2014 then, in that case, he might have made a living by opening a store in a new township. As it was, if he had done so, we fear he would have soon con sumed principal, interest, and profit, on the whole speculation, which was a very foolish, although not an uncommon one, by parties from Great Britain, who seem to forget, or not to know, that even up at Ottawa in Upper Canada, or as far as St. Paul in Minnesota \u2014 the merchants there import direct from Great Britain on the very best terms, and who know best what will sell, and suit their trade and customers. As an important step in the emigrant coming to America, we will now refer to the sub ject of"], [399, "INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. 13 CHOICE OF A SHIP. This is a very important matter, in taking a voyage to America. If you are going by steamer, you can scarcely go wrong, which companies' boat you go with\u2014 whether from Liverpool, GlaBgow, or Southampton \u2014 or by the new line of steamers from Galway (Ire land). For the emigrant, or traveller, who desires to proceed in a sailing vessel, it is of the ut most consequence that he engages his passage in a vessel belonging to respectable proprie tors \u2014 and, if possible, in a ship which is advertised as classed, or called Al. All A 1 vessels may be relied upon as being sea-worthy \u2014 for so many years ; after which time they dare not use that specific mark. Vessels are registered A 1 after they have been inspected by \"Lloyd's\" Surveyor, and pronounced by him as sea- worthy \u2014 for so many years \u2014 averag ing from 7 to 14 years \u2014 the time depending upon of what the ship is built, how she is built, and if built under cover, or not. Probably some friends have preceded you in their voyage to America, and will recom mend you to go by particular ships \u2014 and to engage your passage through particular agents\u2014 or the contrary, may be for good reasons \u2014 to avoid particular companies, ships, and agents also. In engaging your passage through an agent \u2014 at some distance, perhaps, from the port where the ship is \u2014 ascertain that he is respectable \u2014 more particularly in Glasgow, Liverpool, and London \u2014 where some shipping agents are to be found little better than swindlers. Having made up your mind \u2014 that the vessel you purpose going with belongs to a re spectable firm \u2014 that the captain, who commands her, bears a good name \u2014 and that you are ready to take out your passage \u2014 you can do so through some respectable party, who is agent for the vessel you wish to go with. From whoever you take out your passage you will get a printed document \u2014 as a re ceipt for the money you have paid \u2014 which will entitle you to a berth on board the vessel \u2014 and also another document, detailing what provisions you are entitled to on the voyage. That is what is termed the \" Government allowance\" of provisions. For the information of parties, we subjoin a list elsewhere \u2014 as applicable to emigrants \u2014 or steerage passen gers to New York \u2014 or any port in the United States and Canada. The cabin passengers will of course be provided with very much superior diet than what is supplied to steerage passengers ; and if in one of the fine clipper sailing ships \u2014 which now 6ails from Liverpool, London, Glasgow or Aberdeen \u2014 and if he is fond of the sea \u2014 he will find a good table, in general, supplied, and be comfortable in other respects. As connected with this subject, we will refer now to OUTFIT FOR VOYAGE. One of the greatest mistakes which travellers and tourists make, in their first visit to this country, is in the enormous quantity of clothing they bring with them, and that too, sometimes, of a Eort which is unsuitable for the climate and country. As a general rule, almost any old clothing is good enough for wearing on board ship particularly the first week \u2014 when you may be sick. To the emigrant, we would say \u2014 one suit of clothing on your back \u2014 and another handi ly packed in your trunk which is not \" below\" \u2014 as many shirts as will last you for 3 weeks by steamer \u2014 and 6 weeks by sailing vessel Every thing else in proportion. The same quantity for children also. You will find that quite sufficient till you arrive here. The traveller or tourist should also make his trunk as light as possible. At any season of the year \u2014 fancy-coloured woollen shirts will be found the most serviceable of any in coming across the Atlantic \u2014 or travelling through the country."], [400, "14 INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. If you come away any time between the 1st of April and 1st of September, you will have little or no use for thick or heavy clothing at sea\u2014 till you approach the Banks of New foundland\u2014-where the thermometer falls from 30 to 50 degrees\u2014 from one day to another. The cold experienced there is sometimes felt to be intense, so that it is better to have a top-coat at hand for using, when \" off the Banks.\" After you pass there you are within a few days (\" steaming\") of New York, and will find the weather mild and pleasant \u2014 un less when blowing hard. Avoid bringing hats with you, if possible. Both emigrants and tourists will find caps or \" wide-a-wake\" felt hats, with broad brims \u2014 much more agreeable and pleasant, as well as being much more useful for travelling with. It is of fully more consequence to consider what sort of clothing is necessary for America \u2014 so we shall now devote a few remarks on the SUITABLE CLOTHING FOR AMERICA. Not only do many bring far too great a stock of clothing with them for use on board ship \u2014 but also for use when they are travelling through this country on pleasure, or busi ness. Supposing the tourist leaves Great Britain any time during the spring or summer months, for the purpose of making a tour through the States and Canada, he need not burden himself with much clothing. We would recommend him to try a start with a \" wide-a-wake\" felt hat \u2014 which is nice and soft for the head, and which keeps the rays of the sun off the face. A thin, small umbrella \u2014 for using during the hot weather here, as a shade from the sun, or shield from a temporary shower. As many shirts, socks, and handkerchiefs as you may want till you get here \u2014 allowing one shirt, one pair of socks, and one handkerchief to arrive with here, clean. Bring two fancy woollen shirts amongst your supply. Same as regards under-clothiDg, Bring with you an old coat to wear on board ship, one or two pair of trousers, one vest, and a top-coat, 6uch as you generally wear at home. Have them packed in your portman teau along with your shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, collars, etc. \u2014 which is to be in your berth, on the way out. When you get here, you can get, if you wish, two or three dozen of shirts, socks, etc., etc., etc., washed, and done up, in one hour, if you are in a hurry for them. The facilities for such at the hotels being great, every thing almost being done by steam and machinery. In ordinary cases in New York, we have given out washing at 9, a. m., and had it sent up by 11, a. m., all done up. In your travelling through the country, therefore, if you should have only 3 shirts, as many handkerchiefs and pairs of socks, you could never be ill off for clean clothes. When you get here, you may find the weather warmer than you anticipated ; conse quently, either bring with you, or provide yourself, when you get here, with two suits of linen clothing \u2014 either white or brown linen drill, or grass cloth. (See our remarks on dress in America.) Provide accordingly, as you will find yourself compelled to wear clothing here which will not answer for Great Britain, no more than the clothing worn there will answer for wearing here. Have, of course, as few packages as you can. One good-sized American-made trunk \u2014 is all you want to hold every thing you want for a trip for any length of time. If you should run short of 'any article of clothing, don't imagine that they are not to be had here. We hope that it is unnecessary to say to you, Don't be so foolish as to bring any articles of clothing with you to sell here as a \" spec,\" unless you wish to dispose of them at a ruinous loss in some of the auction rooms in the cities or towns you pass through. These remarks do not apply so much in regard to emigrants. They should sell no ar ticle of clothing, unless such will overweight their luggage. In winter time, they can scarcely have too much or too thick clothing. The cold of winter is very severe at the"], [401, "15 INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. same time it _b dry and bracing. Still, tbe warmest clothing they have, for winter wear, should be brought \u2014 as all sorts of woollen clothing is expensive. Clothing for summer wear \u2014 suitable for workmen \u2014 costs a mere trifle, comparatively speaking. For example \u2014 one suit, consisting of 1 pair of trow6ers, and one shirt made in the shape of a \" Guernsey frock\" \u2014 including the indispensable flannel shirt \u2014 costs alto gether about $2, ,or 8s. stg.), which is the almost universal wear of working men \u2014 and suf ficient for wearing on a hot day. As the autumn season advances, heavier clothing is re quired. How you should bring your clothing, and other articles, we will now advert to. LUGGAGE, OR BAGGAGE, FROM HOME. It is of the utmost importance for the emigrant to bring his baggage properly done up \u2014 in trunks or boxes of a proper description. Not attending to this before starting, will be found to be regretted afterwards \u2014 by probably getting the contents destroyed, and costing a good deal for new boxes, etc., in America. We have seen, on arrival at New York \u2014 whilst the luggage was being passed by the custom-house officers \u2014 that the most flimsy and rotten packages have been brought from home. Some trunks, perhaps, which have been in the hands of families for generations, and more fit for firewood than for being labelled \u2014 bound for California, perhaps \u2014 as we have actually seen the case. What is the consequence? When they are lifted up by the handles, thejT break off, perhaps, or before they reach the bottom of the slide from the ship to the small steamer alongside\u2014 waiting to take them on shore \u2014 -the hinges fly off, or the lock gives way, perhaps, and the whole contents are scattered about, and the box forever rendered useless. Such glaring instances of stupidity \u2014 and ignorance of what was necessary for such a voyage \u2014 we could not have believed, had we not seen it displayed. A good, strong, deal box \u2014 with 6tout rope handles \u2014 like a seaman's chest \u2014 is as good a sort as any for the emigrant to have. See that it is not more heavily made than there is occasion for \u2014 so as to keep your weight of baggage as light as you can ; but better to have a box too strong than too slim \u2014 as we have explained. It would be better to have strong hinges \u2014 with padlock on it \u2014 and iron-clasped at the corners. The American-made trunks are amongst the best we have seen for the purpose of travel ling. They can be had in many places in Great Britain, and in any part of America \u2014 all qualities and prices. They are generally known by having large brass or iron knobs stud ded all over them ; they are set upon castors very often \u2014 so as to move about easily \u2014 and have two pieces of wood nailed along the length of the bottom, to keep them off the ground or floor. Bedding \u2014 such as blankets, sheeting, etc. \u2014 which is expensive in America \u2014 should be brought in all cases \u2014 tightly wrapped up in old bed-covers or canvas \u2014 and put into as little bulk as possible. Furniture \u2014 of every description \u2014 should be left, or sold off, before starting \u2014 as it can be bought for half the price in America it can be produced at in Britain. Crockery. \u2014 China, glass, etc. \u2014 which should be brought out \u2014 ought to be particularly well packed\u2014 -to prevent breakage. Such articles are very expensive in America ; there fore, a saving will be effected by bringing with you what you have \u2014 carefully packed. If you are to have far land-carriage after your arrival, you must recollect that every pound over and above 50 lbs. is charged for\u2014 and sometimes the carriage for baggage comes to a good deal of money\u2014 but still less than the difference of the cost of what you bring with you, and what you will pay for such here. The charge for such overweight is about 20 cents (10J. stg.) for 100 lbs. per every 100 miles."], [402, "16 INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. PORT OF DEPARTURE. Where you sail from, aud what port you arrive at in America, depends upon various cir cumstances, as to which may be best. If you are situated in the Eastern Counties \u2014 or near London \u2014 that port will, most likely, suit your convenience best, if you wish to go by a sailing vessel. There are no 6teamers from London ; but the Havre and Belgian steamers sail for New York from Southampton, as may be seen from their advertisements. The delay in the English Channel is sometimes very considerable for sailing vessels, before they get \" out to sea.\" If living in the Midland Counties, West of England, or North of England, you will find Liverpool, no doubt, the most convenient port of departure. From there, vessels of one sort or another are to be found sailing daily to ports in the United States; so that if bound for the United States, you will take a packet nearest to your destination \u2014 the chief port being New York \u2014 but not always the best for arriving at certain districts. Steamers sail regularly for New York, Boston, and Quebec \u2014 with sailing vessels, also, frequently to there, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, etc. Passengers from Scotland may sail, either by steamer or sailing vessel, from the Clyde \u2014 direct to New York \u2014 or by sailing vessel to any other port in the States, or Quebec, Canada ; or from Liverpool \u2014 as above. If situated in Dundee, Aberdeen, and North of Scotland \u2014 and bound for Canada \u2014 passen gers will find excellent clipper packets from Aberdeen to Quebec \u2014 which make the passage in about 30 to 35 days. In taking out your passage tickets in Great Britain, you may be \u00bbsked to book further than the port of your arrival \u2014 hence we may notice the subject of SECURING PASSAGE TICKETS. It is in so many cases dangerous to procure tickets in Great Britain for any point further than the port of arrival in this country, that we advise all emigrants and tourists to book only to the port of arrival in America. No doubt, the through tickets of such as the Grand Trunk Railway Company \u2014 issued in England \u2014 may be good enough to wherever they book; but the emigrant will find means of getting tickets to his destination, when he gets here, equally cheap. When you come here \u2014 \" booked through\" in England \u2014 you are neces sitated to proceed by one particular route \u2014 and, as you are booked through, you are not so likely to receive that attention, as when you wish to book from any point here, on to your destination. Should you arrive at Quebec, there are more ways than one, most probably of proceeding to your destination; and on inquiry of Mr. Buchanan, the government emigre tion officer \u2014 at the emigration office on the quay there \u2014 he will give you particulars of all the routes \u2014 what they cost, etc., etc. Then you can please yourself wiiich way to go. Through tickets are issued in England by parties interested in particular lines of travel; and, once booked through, you are obliged to go by them \u2014 whether they suit you best, or otherwise. Again, you arrive at New York, as an emigrant. At Castle Garden you will get every information respecting the different routes, and get your tickets there for wherever you are going to. (See Castle Garden, New York.) In some respects, \"through tickets\" from England may be of advantage, whilst the swindling practised in selling through tickets there \u2014 which are perfectly worthless in this country \u2014 makes us caution every one to be careful before he pays for a \" through ticket,\" and rather advise him to pay his passage only to the port on this side which he is to arrive at. Tourists, in booking from Quebec and New York, should always take out their tickets"], [403, "INFORMATION TO PERSONS EMIGRATING. 17 at the booking-office at the railroad station, and not at any of the booking or ticket-offices to be found in such numbers in all the large cities. In America it is very different in that respect to Great Britain, where you can only get your ticket at the railroad depot. Here, a system of ticket agency has been established, many of the ticket-offices being neither more nor less than ticket swindles. See separate article, headed \" Railroad Tickets.\" In connection with the subject of \" booking through\" tickets, even in America, we give the following case of very gross misconduct, as it appears to us, on the part of a conductor on one of the lines in the State of New York. We give this case as a sample to show, that even where parties purchase their tickets at the proper office, in this country, and are booked through a long distance, they do not always find such tickets available, as they profess to be, according to agreement. We have never met with any such cases ourselves, but no one can shut his eyes to the facts as detailed in the following advertisement, which appeared in the New York Tribune of 16th September last: \u2014 RAILROAD PETTY FRAUDS, AND GREAT IMPOSITIONS.-On the 13th of August last, three gentlemen \u2014 one a citizen of Chicago \u2014 purchased at the proper office in Chicago three tickets through to New York, expressly stipulating and agreeing with the company there, and they for all the companies on the route, that these gentlemen should have the privilege of trav- elling only (lays, stopping off nights, and also stop off' at Saratoga as long as they might choose. Arriving at Buffalo at about, 12 o'clock of a Saturday night, two of the company decided to remain in Buffalo over Sunday, and the third went to Chittenango to spend the time with friends. On leaving Buffalo, one of the gentlemen inquired of the conductor, who came around to ex amine and mark or punch the tickets, whether such process would kill the ticket to Albany, as he was desirous of stopping at Schenectady, to visit Saratoga for a few days. The conductor replied no, but stated, that when they arrived at Utica the gentleman must get from the con- ductor from that place a stop-over ticket, as was their custom. After passing Chittenango, they were rejoined by their friend, who informed them, that in consequence of the conductor having punched his check, he had been compelled, on coming on the cars, by the new conductor, to re- pay his fare, under penalty of being put off the cars if he did not. In order to save a repetition of this trouble and expense, when the conductor came around after leaving Dtica, the gentle- man who proposed to stop at Schenectady civilly stated the circumstances, exhibited his ticket, good on iU face for a ride over tke road for a fortnight, and requested either that he would not punch the ticket, or else give him a ticket to stop over as agreed upon. To which the conductor, in a most insolent manner, replied, that he would accede to neither request, but that he should punch the ticket or turn the passenger out of the car. The gentleman very properly declined to submit tec all these civilities, whereupon Mr. Conductor ..topped his train \u2014 it being about 12 o'clock at night \u2014 and catling in the assistance of a brakeman, succeeded in forcing the gentle- man, with great violence, and against much remonstrance, off' from the train, causing him con- siderable personal injury, and landing him in a strange country, without his baggage or shelter. It is barely possible that the strong arm of this giant and infamous railroad corporation is om- nipotent enough iu this state to shield it from legal punishment for such outrages. The above is an unvarnished story, and is only one of large numbers which have occurred. It is proposed by the present party, well known and honoured at home, to test this question for the benefit of the travelling public as well as himself. One principal object of this statement is to reach the attention of two gentlemen (strangers) who occupied the seat immediately in front, and who heard and saw all that passed. Should this notice meet their observation, it is hoped thev will send tbeir addresses to Messrs. PARSONS, RIGGS AND RIGGS, Attorneys, No. 10 Wall street, New York. EXAMINATION OF PASSENGERS BEFORE SAILING. Before sailing from any port a surgeon examines all the steerage passengers, just before sailing, and when all are on board, to see if none are unfit to proceed, from having any disease, or lameness about them, which may incapacitate them for emigrating to America \u2014 the government of that country being particular that they should not be saddled with the supporting of all the \" halt, the lame, and the blind,\" and the diseased from any part of the world. All, therefore, before starting, have to pass the government emigration agent, and a surgeon, before they can proceed. In the case of cabin passengers, they are exempt from such examination ; it being pre sumed, if there are any of that class amongst them, that they have friends who are able to take care of them, or can pay for being taken care of."], [404, "18 VOYAGE OUT \u2014 SEA-SICKNESS. Supposing that you are meditating to start soon, a few hints on that subject, before you start, may be of some little use to you, as well as give you some idea of life on board ship in crossing the Atlantic. VOYAGE OUT. During the voyage out, you must be prepared to miss many of the comforts you have had at home, not only in the quantity and quality of the food supplied, but in the man ner in which it is cooked. Even in the fine steamers, which ply between Britain and America, when the stomach is out of order \u2014 and in the dead-throws of sea-sickness, or just recovering from it \u2014 the traveller will then, perhaps, be apt to turn with loathing upon every thing, and almost every body, excepting the helping hand of the steward, or stewardess. If you are a cabin passenger \u2014 either on board a steamer or sailing vessel \u2014 you will be comparatively well off. Presuming it is your first voyage, we would say, that, for some days before starting, you should get your stomach and bowels, as far as practicable, into healthy action and good order. Should you get sick, acquaint the surgeon of the vessel \u2014 whose business it is to visit you once or twice a day, and who will render you all the advice and assistance in his power \u2014 although that sometimes is of little use. We would say, then, supposing you are laid up, sick \u2014 get from off your stomach, as soon as you ean, all that is likely to come. Keep your berth for a day or two \u2014 lying as flat a3 you can on your back \u2014 with your head low, and so \" fixed\" in your berth, that you will form, as much as possible, a part of the berth itself, and move with the vessel as she moves, and not be rolling about like a loose log, in your bed. Don't be in a hurry trying to eat. After you have been without food for a day or two, weather permitting, make a desperate effort \u2014 with the assistance of the steward, if necessary \u2014 to get up, and master old Neptune with the touch of sickness he has laid upon you. If the weather is fair, get on deck without delay \u2014 and don't linger about either saloon, pantry, or anywhere else ; but, getting on deck, seat yourself with your face to the wind, so as to inhale the sea air, the iodine and saline particles of which, will be amongst the first things to recover the tone and strength of your stomach. If you feel thirsty, avoid spirits of all sorts, and malt liquors \u2014 although some recom mend bottled porter. In some cases it may answer. Try what is called lemonade, on board ship and in America \u2014 not the effervescing bottled liquor of that name \u2014 but a piece of lemon, well bruised in a tumbler \u2014 till you have squeezed all the juice out of it, a teaspoonful of white sugar, bruised, and fill up with cold water. In many cases we have seen this refreshing drink, relished, when every thing else failed to get down the throat. When on deck, get a cabin biscuit, and try to eat it. Pursue this course, and next day, or day after, you may be able to enter the saloon, and partake of the regular meals which are being supplied. After you are able to enter the cabin, don't sit there too long, but spend as much of your time as possible on deck, till you are completely yourself agaia Be very careful how you use your stomach in the saloon \u2014 as, although you may never have suffered from a bad, or weak stomach in your life before, you will there find out, perhaps, you have a very delicate member to deal with, and requiring care in its treat ment towards convalescence. At breakfast, it is possible you may find, at first, that porridge and molasses are more agreeable to take, than any thing else. That, however, is a matter of taste. The tea, which is supplied on board ship, is often boiled, instead of being infused and boiled as black as can be ; and being so strong, is, in many cases, scarcely suited for the stomach of a rhinocerous \u2014 far less for an emigrant on his first voyage across the Atlantic and recovering from sea-sickness."], [405, "MEALS SUPPLIED\u2014 MANAGEMENT OF VESSELS. 19 The coffee, on the other hand, being generally roasted onboard ship, is often too much, and often too little, roasted \u2014 sailors, in general, being poor coffee-roasters; and when ground, although fresh enough, the aroma of that favourite beverage is no more like the fragrance of pure, properly roasted mocha, than it is of a piece of boiled gutta percha. To stomachs, recovering from sea-sickness, the tea and coffee very frequently on board ship is any thing but pleasant\u2014 the flavour of the one, and the sight of the color of the other, (but in that respect it is difficult to tell which is which,) being quite enough, with out tasting cither. For that reason, neither are used by many during the whole voyage \u2014 but pure cold water, or water and milk, mixed, is preferred ; and that, no doubt, is more congenial to the stomach than either the tea or the coffee above referred to. With these exceptions, the meals on board ship, in the cabin, are, generally, very excellent \u2014 in some of the steamers resembling the set-out at a first-class hotel \u2014 dinner, particularly, with its dessert afterwards, as a regular thing. In the steerage end. the emigrant will find our advice, as to sea-sicknesss, equally applicable It appears to us to be a standing disgrace to ship-owners and 6teamboat proprietors, that, in the matter ot tea and coffee, such shamefully-cooked rubbish should be offered to their passengers, as the tea and coffee which is served out, and more particularly, do we make this remark, on behr.lt of many ladies, probably with children, in the cabin\u2014 and many hundred of respectable and honest women, with their children, in the steerage \u2014 to all of whom a cup of that which \"cheers, but not inebriates,\" would be particularly grateful, during their severe trials on a voyage across the Atlantic, with, perhaps, them selves dead sick, and their helpless little ones, in the same condition alongside of them. The cause of this neglect \u2014 for it is nothing else \u2014 does not arise from any petty feeling to save so much. We believe quite the reverse. The steward, under-steward, or cooks, are often grossly careless, and extravagant in the use of these two articles of diet, whilst pre paring them \u2014 and have not the slightest regard, whether they are consumed or not We don't, therefore, charge the proprietors of vessels with a desire to save these articles \u2014 but of the most wanton extravagance on the part of their cooks \u2014 the most barefaced favour itism to some passengers \u2014 friends of the ship's servants, or others who bribe them \u2014 and a total disregard, in that particular, as to the comfort of their passengers in general. We would here remind those gentlemen ship-owners and managers \u2014 who sit esconced so comfortably in their easy chairs in their Brussels-carpeted offices \u2014 that they have a duty to perform, as well as an interest to pocket \u2014 in seeii.g that their vessels are equipped with proper men, as well as with proper sailing tackle. They are the guardians of the weak and the unprotected in the many hours and days of danger and suffering, in crossing the Atlantic. They are bound in honour, as well as in duty, to see that the servants they em ploy are men who will violate no moral, no more than they will a criminal law towards the passengers, and their property. They must be reminded that they are not entitled to look upon their second-class passengers as dogs \u2014 simply because they are not able to afford first-class fare ; and it is their duty to see that something like humanity should be exercised toward the weak and the helpless male and female passenger \u2014 and not consider that any thing is good enough for them, for the aforesaid reason. There is too much of that cold-blooded indifference on the part of all on board many vessels \u2014 from the captain down to cabin boy \u2014 in their treatment of steerage passengers ; and it is high time that directors and managers of steamers and sailing vessels looked to those things \u2014 if they have souls within them, with any other higher feelings, above pounds, shillings, and pence, or dollai'6 and cents. If they prove, by their continued indifference, that they have not, we only hope that the vigilance of the government emigration agents will, on properly represented facts of outrage or injustice, bring them to their senses before a court \u2014 where the emigrant stands, then, on the same footing as the captain or owner \u2014 and that such companies will become marked by emi grants. We are aware we will be met with the reply, that there are some people whom it is impossible to satisfy \u2014 and we grant it; nay, more, we are aware that from the fact of many \u2014 leaving home, and going to sea for the first time \u2014 are peevish, aud easily inclined"], [406, "20 TREATMENT OF PASSENGERS \u2014 BAGGAGE. to grumble and cry out, sometimes, more frightened than hurt. But let us ask, is that any reason why not more interest should be taken than there is, to prevent the violation of in nocent and unprotected females by the brutes in human form who are to be fonnd sailing as officers or crews ? or why a man ought to hold his tongue when he smarts under the injustice of a petty officer, backed up by his superior ; and if that man insists in denouncing cases of injustice or inhumanity, that he should be threatened with being placed in irons, and every petty meanness and discomfort thrown in his way '.' Is it any reason why such gross mismanagement and carelessness in the cooking of passengers' food should be allowed to exist? where tea and coffee \u2014 as we have said \u2014 is offered, not fit for the pigs, far less for the delicate stomachs of poor but honest women and children during a voyage \u2014 when not a drop of milk can be got, either for love or money ? Steamboat owners, who charge \u00a37 to \u00a38 for a passage of 12 to 14 days to their second-class passengers, need not suppose these remarks do not apply to them. We tell them plainly, that many of them have as great need to reform as their brethren who sail passenger sailing vessels. We could name \u2014 if we were disposed \u2014 steamers sailing to and from Great Britain and America where, even in that small matter of tea and coffee, the rubbish offered even to their cabin passengers, is such, that if set down to the breakfast of the dainty owners and agents, in their own homes, would quickly find a place somewhere else, and the careless servant who had prepared it, run the risk of being kicked about his business. On behalf of helplessly sick first and second-class female passengers, we trust to hear of improvement in that respect. \" 0, but,\" says Mr. Contentmen.-with-anything, \" they should have brought some tea and coffee of their own, and a tea and coffee-pot \u2014 then they would have been all right.\" Why should they, when they have paid for these things, and expected to have them supplied fit to drink? Besides, many do not expect to be served in that manner, otherwise, we have no doubt, they would provide accordingly; but, in the same way, the}- might be expected, in the course of time, to provide their own beef and mutton, also. Regarding the meat, also, supplied to second-class passengers in some steamers, we un hesitatingly assert that the quantity, quality, and manner in which it is cooked, belies the statements of advertisements which state, that steerage passengers are supplied with as much provisions as they can eat, all of the best quality and properly cooked, by the servants of the company. Such can only refer to passengers who are the favourites of stewards and cooks on board, who are very differently served from the steerage passengers in general. The public are- always assured that \"an experienced surgeon\" accompanies the ship, but it is just as well that no pretensions are made on account of the doctor's services or visits to the steerage-end. We could name vessels where surgeons have not visited steerage pas sengers till some days after sailing, and when they did, treated them in a very unbecoming and careless manner ; in truth, not simply doing their duty. They know very well they dare not treat cabin passengers so, but the unfortunate steerage passengers must go with out medicine for all some doctors either know or care how to treat them. We are aware that first-class passengers, in the exuberance of their joy at landing, and having enjoyed themselves pretty well under the captain's smiles, at the head of the table \u2014 in many of those flowery congratulatory addresses which are presented to captains on arrival \u2014 forget altogether to consult the other end of the ship, as to what the}' have to say on the subject. We suspect if they did, they would find a few amendments \u2014 in consulting the opinion of the second-class passengers \u2014 if not a vote of a different sort \u2014 or a petition to some quarter on shore. But these individuals look through, not only their own spectacles, but through the eyes of others, and express an opinion for others \u2014 as if the second-class passengers were not worth consulting. That, is about the truth of it. In fact, that system of toadying captains of vessels by cabin passengers has become so common, that in times of real danger, and when the daring skill and bravery of a captain has been nobly displayed, one really does not know whether to believe it \u2014 when he reads a truthful compliment of that nature \u2014 as such honours are so fulsomely expressed, and so easily obtained ; when if"], [407, "21 INCIDENTS ON VOYAGE. all the facts were truthfully presented, 6ome such addresses ought to be very differently worded. Another matter, we consider, ought to be looked into, and that is, all the luggage of passengers being under the ship's care \u2014 and that if any of it is stolen or destroyed, the owners to be held liable for such \u2014 in the same manner that a railroad company is. Why not check the baggage across the ocean \u2014 from point to point \u2014 where there are no changes on the way '! Until that, or some such system, is adopted, the same ras<ally thieving on board ship will continue ; more particularly so long as the system of employing \" Packet arians\" as part of the crew continues, and who sail only for one voyage, and whose real object in going to sea, is to secure as much plunder as possible on the passage, of property belonging to passengers. We observe some Canadian papers recommend passengers \u2014 in coming to America \u2014 to avoid landing at New York, and advise them to sail direct to Quebec, and by that route pass through Canada into the United States. This may do very well where the passenger is bound for a locality by which Quebec would be his nearest or cheapest way ; but we have yet to loarn that the management of steamers and sailing vessels, to and from Quebec, is so much superior, or that the crews who sail in them are so much more virtuous than the men who sail from the same ports for New York. So far as that goes, we fear they are pretty much all \" tarred with one stick.\" Until the government emigration commissioners adopt some stringent rules, pertaining to officers as well as men on board ship \u2014 and for the safety of all the luggage\u2014 whether \" below\" or not \u2014 we fear little good will be effected for the latter ; although we say that the owners and managers of ships have a great deal in their power \u2014 if they would use it. We believe, if any company would guarantee their passengers against ill-usage, treat them properly, show no favoritism to some passengers, to the injury of others \u2014 afford personal protection to their female passengers, and see to the punishing of offenders, and securing the safety of baggage \u2014 such a company would have no need to deplore the small dividends, and croak about the shipping trade going to ruin. Parties, having children on board ship, should, as far as possible, keep them -under their eye, as, in running about, and with the rolling of the vessel, they may get hurt. All pas sengers ought to avoid sitting on the side rails of the vessel, as they may be pitched over board before they are aware. Sometimes experienced men lose their lives in that way. One instance may be mentioned, of the case of the steward of the steamer \" New York\" \u2014 on her last voyage from New York to Glasgow \u2014 being drowned, by falling overboard off the rail, whilst sitting and smoking a cigar there. In the cabin as well as steerage-end of the vessel, all passengers ought to endeavour to render the voyage as agreeable and comfortable as possible, by every one evincing a desire to contribute to the enjoyment of the voyage. In the cabin-end, the evenings are fre quently devoted to singing and instrumental music, dancing on deck, readings, recitationE, speeches on humorous subjects, mock trials by judge and jury,\u2014 with passengers as counsels and defendants. In that way, many an evening is spent very pleasantly, after the first 3 or 4 days' experience at sea has passed over, and all the company begin to make their ap pearance. During the day, the time may be occupied in writing (weather permitting), reading, chess, draught, and card-playing. The latter may be said to be the never-failing and ever new recreation\u2014 either at whist or the great American game of \" Eukre.\" The cabins are plentifully supplied with literature in all departments. For a game on deck, that of \" bowling at sea\" is excellent for a change, if the vessel is not pitching or rolling too much. On Sunday, if any clergyman is on board, he is asked to preach a sermon in the cabin, and all the passengers (steerage included) can attend if they desire to do so. The speed of the ship's progress is ascertained by \"\u25a0 heaving the lead,\" which is done very fre quently during the day, and the result calculated of how many miles she is running per hour, or how far she has run in the 24 hours. That is posted up in the cabin once a day, and is one of the themes about which passengers speculate not a little, often leading to some very heavy bets\u2014 in lemonade, etc.\u2014 as to who should guess nearest the mark, for the"], [408, "22 EXCHANGING SIGNALS AT SEA. past 24 hours sailing. A cry of \" A sail, a sail,\" heaving in sight, which, to parties on land, may sound nothing extraordinary or interesting, but when at sea, and having seen nothing but the vast space of water for several days, perhaps, the appearance of a vessel becomes an object of great interest, and if she should happen to come within speaking-distance, there is quite a commotion, in seeing how the code of signals between each ship is worked ; how expertly the mate will hoist hia ship's number by flags, in answer to, or asking a question at, the craft in sight ; how the captain stands, telescope in one hand, and a book in the other \u2014 containing the name and number of every ship, we suppose, in the world \u2014 and on the appearance of those hieroglyphic stripes and crosses on the flags hoisted up by the ship in sight, he can tell through his telescope that these signs mean certain numbers, and on referring to his book, can tell also that these numbers are, probably, No. 6750, and that that is the number of \" The Travelling Scotchman,\" on his way from Liverpool to Boston, but having lost his reckoning, is not very sure whether he is on his way there, or to New Zealand, so he telegraphs by another set of flags, and asks the question, \" What's your longi tude ?\" when last taken, (it may be either that day or day before,) as it is quite possible he may Dot have been able to take it for several days on account of the cloudy state of the weather, and no sun to be seen to take it by. He is answered by your captain, according to what it was when last taken, by another set of flags, representing numbers. After the captain of the other ship has got his information, he hoists another set of flags, to convey the intelligence \u2014 \" Have lost rudder,\" or it may be, \" Short of water,\" or \" Short of pro visions,\" or \"Very leaky;\" in which ease, the ships \"heave to,\" and come within speak ing-distance through the speaking-trumpet. The captains then consult what is best to be done, and act accordingly. Again, another splendid clipper may be met with \u2014 every stitch of canvas up \u2014 this time it may be one of Messrs. Halls' unrivalled Aberdeen clippers on her way to Quebec, flying along before the wind \"like a thing of life,\" but there is little apparent progress observable. A fine sight, however, it is, to see one of these noble, full sized crafts \u2014 with every inch of sail set \u2014 careering over the ocean, with not another ves tige to be seen but her, between you and the boundless sea and horizon, and that inter rupted only now and then by her bidding defiance to the angry salt water god, as she rides so gracefully over the billows. At night, again, when all are comfortably seated at table, hearing some extempore harangue, in imitation of the \" stump,\" or, perhaps, some one who once could sing, doing his best to contribute to the harmony of the evening by attempting \"Auld lang Syne,\" when a cry gets up on deck, \" A sail, oh \u2014 a sail, oh.\" A sail at night \u2014 in the dark \u2014 how is it to be seen ? Seen or unseen, the company fly in search of shawls, over-coats, hats, and caps, and 6camper away on deck. Sure enough there is a light a long way oft\". By and by, when you are standing straining your eyes trying to see what you can, a great whiz behind you, announces that the captain has sent up a rocket, and there it goes, soaring away, comet-like, up into the sky. The vessel in sight has seen it, and she replies in similar fiery language, and shoots up her voice of the same sort, as much as to say, \" We see you,\" \" All well,\" or \" How do you do ?\" Again and again the rockets go up. She now comes nearer, but still many miles off. She is going east, whilst you are pointed due west, or, perhaps, N. N. W. She is now better seen. The captain has got his practised eye to the night-glass \u2014 a clever glass, that, which can discern things in the dark ; but so it is, as he declares it to be a steamer. Yes, so it is. You see her long saloon lighted up, showing off her windows, like so many lighted port-holes. Would that you could speak to her \u2014 to take word to Liverpool, that you are so far on your way, all well, and have that chronicled by the million-tongued press to all parts of the kingdom. But no, it is too dark, you cannot make out her name, but to give an idea of who she is, she hoists a blue light at her bow and another at her stern, and from the day of sailing of all steamers be ing known, the time out at sea, and the apparent size of the vessel, the captain can tell you she is a \" Cunard\" boat \"Yes,\" says he, \" it is the ' Persia,' perhaps ; she sailed on such a day from New York \u2014 and it must be her\" \u2014 so down goes the entry in the log-book : \"Passed a large steamer, proceeding east, at 10, p. M., on the inst\" The captain of"], [409, "\"OFF THE BANKS\" \u2014 FOGS. 23 the steamer you are on board, returned his signals of blue lights, burning for a few minutes at each end of his ship, and thus the captain of the other steamer knew it to be a steamer also, and would be able to tell, very likely, in the same way what steamer you were on board of, and so, entering it in the same manner in his log-book, you will be reported at Liverpool, after all, on his arrival there, as having \" passed a steamer proceeding west, at 10, p. m., on the inst. ;\" and thus signals are exchanged even at night, although, of course, not so particularly as they can be done during the day. In this manner does the voyage proceed every other day, something turning up to interest the passengers, until you begin to hear various talk about, and calculation, how far you are from the \"Banks.\" In your simplicity, you wonder whaJ \" Banks\" are meant, and when they will be seen. In a day or two, you are startled by the hoarse steam-whiBtle blowing its voice as a warning* to all ahead of it You are now enveloped in a dense fog, so the whistle continues to blow, alternately with the ringing of a huge bell, and thus the bell-ringing and steam-whistle keep up a continuous noisy concert, sometimes for hours only, but sometimes for days and nights together. This will be the first intimation, perhaps, that you are \" off the Banks.\" You, no doubt. have an inward desire to keep off them, too ; but let us inform you, that there is no cause for alarm \u2014 as the said \" Banks\" are quietly \" located\" at the depth of several hundred feet down, and that there will be that depth of water for you to pass over them. Arrived at what is called \" the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland,\" the 6teamer is stopped, and the lead is dropped. This is a piece of lead about the size a_.d shape of a policeman's baton, tied to a rope, which it is to convey to the \" bottom of the sea.\" At the end of the lead, there is a hollow, which is filled up with white tallow or grease, and some extended over the end of it Thus prepared \u2014 and the vessel brought to a stand, or a floating position \u2014 the lead is dropped into the sea, and allowed to run down by the rope till it finds the bottom. When it touches the ground, the mate who lets it out knows, and, as the rope is marked by knots, denoting distances, he pulls it up, and by and by the lead is drawn on board. A close inspection of the end of the lead takes place by the captain and officers \u2014 to ascertain what description of \" bottom\" there is. If \" green sand, ' you are on the \" Grand Bank\" of New foundland, and with so many fathoms of water below you \u2014 so there is no danger of your running aground. That ascertained \u2014 and the depth of water there \u2014 steam is put on again, and away you go on your course \u2014 but only at half speed, as the fog is getting thicker, and the noise of the steam-whistle and bell, is kept up alternately, at intervals, to warn vessels which may be near \u2014 although they cannot be seen, till that they are so close, that the man on the look out has to be very vigilant at his post. Supposing, however, that a light wind has sprung up, it has opened one of those peculiar-looking vistas through the fog \u2014 and you see the horizon, clear and beautiful, at the end of it \u2014 and thankful you are to see your way out of the maize of vapour you have been so long enveloped in. Whilst these mists are clearing off, you will, probably, observe some peculiarly beautiful phenomena during the process \u2014 till at last the steam-whistle has ceased its unearthly noise, the bell has ceased its din, aud now you are transported into a new world of crystal light \u2014 with a cloudless sky overhead, and the sun beaming upon you. You now feel a different being; and, with the cheering news of a change in the wind in your favour, the spirits of all on board begin to dance as light as corks on the waves below you. \" Haul away that main-sail, will ye?\" shouts the captain. \" Let go that main-brace,\" shouts the first officer \u2014 when at it the sailors go, with right good will \u2014 and with long pulls, strong pulls, and pulling altogether, they spread out the main-sail. See how they pull ; and singing one of their ditties as they pull, and in that stentorian style, which you have heard several times before on the voyage, at all hours of night and day. \" Let go that mizzen top-sail, there, will you ?\" shouts the captain again. \" Pull up your slack there, boys\" \u2014 and with an \" Aye, aye, sir\" of response from the willing Jacks \u2014 you are now sailing with every bit of canvas up; the whole ship \u2014 as viewed from the stern \u2014 looking like a perfect mountain of canvas spread out before you ; and so, with all these set square, and filled by Boreas, and favoured by Neptune keeping the sea quiet, and with the engines working full speed, you are now \" going"], [410, "24 TAKING A PILOT ON BOARD. a-head\" at the rattling pace of not less than 13 miles an hour. You have now got over other 24 hours, at that rate, or about it; so, instead of the log showing 180, 200, or 240 miles per day, it now springs up to 312 miles; or \u2014 if on board a Cunard boat \u2014 up as high as 360 miles \u2014 on which there is a shout of \" hurra !\" in the saloon, as the officer hangs up the board, with the distance announced upon it. You are now probably within a few hundred miles of New York; and, when all seated again, in the saloon, at night, you are startled on the sudden running to and fro. on deck, as if there was something going forward, when \" A sail a-head\" is heard. Again, at night ! So upon deck all the passengers go, to see what steamer this would be, two days on her way out across the Atlantic. But look! there are two lights \u2014 actually two vessels, and both sailing right ahead of you ! The captain gives the word, \" Port.\" The helmsman alters the course a little. Still they come on, both pretty near each other, and still coming right a-head, nearly. Who, or what are they ? What do they mean ? Don't they see your white light up on the foremast, and your green light at one side, and red at the other? Don't they see from that, your vessel is a steamer ? The captain and officers are puzzled a little bit. \"Port your helm,\" shouts the captain, a little annoyed, as he cannot make them out. They are sailing craft ; that is easy to see, by the position and movement of their lights on the water. One of them is now sheering off to \" leeward.\" \" Port, hard-a- port,\" shouts the captain, again, with redoubled fury. By this time, yon and the passen- gers canuot make out what it all means. Even the captain's inscrutable night-glasses refuse to do duty, or assist only to make the darkness more visible, till at last, the captaiD, turning round, shouts out once more, and looking not over pleased : \" Port your helm, bard a-port, will ye?' \"Hard a-port, sir,\" cries the helmsman. \" Stop the engine,\" cries the captain to the officer on the look-out, amidships \u2014 and bang \u2014 bang \u2014 bang \u2014 goes the big sounding bell in the engine room, and the engines are stopped. You all expect \" a ruD into\" \u2014 but no. Here the lights of the two vessels you have seen come close upon you, and in the dark blackness of the moonless night, two small sails come scudding along, and pass ; one of them within 20 yards, and the other about 100 yards off. In the wink of an eye almost, when the nearest boat reaches opposite your stern, she turns round, hauls down her sail, and pulling up along-side, shouts out something or other. Goodness gracious! what's up? some shipwrecked passengers; pirates, (hints an old lady near you,) coming on board unasked, and without you being prepared to give them a reception of the right sort. What's to be done? You and the passengers are all thronged on the poop of the deck, wondering what is to do. When, in the lull of the wind, you now hear distinctly, \" Pilot ahoy !\u00b0 Oh, what a deliverance to the said old lady. Thus, it appears that the two boats seen approaching were no other than two smart Yan- kee pilot boats, belonging to different companies, running a keen night sailing mateh, as to who should get first on board of your steamer, and take her to New York So by thib time, a pilot is seen crawling up the gangway, and jumping on deck-a recognition between the captain and the first sample of an American seaman you may have seen in your life takes place-when there is a cordial shaking hands of each other, instead of re- volvers at each other-restores the mental equilibrium of all on board, and, with steam once more put on full speed, you go on a-head, whilst the pilot boat hoists its sail once more to travel over the sea in the darkness of the night, and have another race for the next ship that shows its light in sight, and more particularly if it is a steamer The idea of the \" pilot\" being on board will, no doubt, have made you feel more safe than ever, more particularly he being an American pilot, and being near home, you presume tha t, at least, he ought to know, by headmark, every wave as it turns np, as well as he knows the channel of the North River. You are not, however, so near New York as yon suppose. These two pilot boats have been out six days and six nights, seeking and watching for you, as they knew when you ought to be in port, as well as your captain did and in picking you up, that night, they found you some 340 to 400 miles from New York' Going 340 miles to sea in an open boat, for the sake of piloting a vessel up the river i Well, if that is not pushing business, you begin to think you don't know what that means."], [411, "READING \"THE LATEST NEWS \" \u2014 LAND IN SIGHT. 25 Who ever heard of a Southampton, or Liverpool pilot going 300 or 400 miles to sea, to lay in wait for steamers or sailing vessels! But so it is in America. These men go out upwards of 400 miles for that purpose. Eight or ten men start in one boat. When a ship is picked up, they put one on board. The captain must take the first who comes. Leav ing one thus on board, they proceed on their search, till they have only as many left as will take the boat home again. A very hazardous life it is. The arrival of the pilot, therefore, has been a great event in your voyage, and as he has brought some New York papers, every thing else is thrown aside, and clusters crowd round the solitary newspaper or two which he has brought, when the crush becomes so great that there is a spontaneous request that Mr. Smith, with the spectacles on, should read out the \"latest news,\" for \"pro bono publico,\" or for the general information of one and all who have not heard whether Great Britain still occupied the same position in the middle of the ocean as she did when you left home, or whether the Leviathan had got her steam up. So Mr. Smith reads out the latest quotations of consuls \u2014 that they were J worse \u2014 that the old lady in Threadneedle street had put on the discount screw, by giving it another twist Jth up \u2014 that the \" Democratic ticket\" was going the whole hog, whilst the \" Republican ticket\" was driving a-head at the rate of \" two-forty\" \u2014 but what \" ticket\" you did not understand \u2014 that there was glorious news, such as to set the ears and eyes of all in the cabin agog, till Mr. Smith's breath might well be taken away from him almost \u2014 the \" Cable successfully laid\" \u2014 when all the passengers concluded at once it was an invention of Mr. Smith, to amuse them, so, with one accord, they would call out, \"Gammon,\" \"Humbug,\" \"Fudge,\" \" A sell of the enemy ;\" and so it went, till at length the paper was torn in the midst of the excitement, and walked off with by Mr. Nobody, who wanted to have a private tete-a-tete with the newspaper, and the pilot, before going to bed. Next morning, you find a strange gentleman seated along-side of the captain, who, with clean-shaved cheeks, bushy beard, thin, sallow complexion, turn-down collar, you really cannot mistake who he is. He is a Yankee, that is certain. But pilots don't appear in such decent \" toggery\" on the coast of Britain, when on business, nor yet are they, we think, honoured with one of the chief seats at the same table with captain and passengers. But so you will find it to be, and no doubt you will be glad to meet with a man capable of taking a seat at table with the best of you, more particularly when you have an idea, that, to a certain extent, your life and those of all on board are in his hands. On conversing with him, as he paces the deck, you will doubtless find him an intelligent per son, who can talk upon a great many subjects, and whose relating an account of his race, the night before, with the opposition boat, on the high seas, must be heard to be enjoyed, so we will not spoil it by attempting to describe it after him. He has now taken charge of the vessel, and he politely tells you you are in sight of land. But where it is, you, nor no one passenger can discover, either with or without a telescope. He points to a streak in the horizon, to the right, as being \" Long Island.\" You begin to \" guess\" he is quizzing you, when he is calmly backed out, by the captain and officers, who see it, before any passenger does. You may fancy you see something, or nothing, at the very edge of the water point of view. Thus you stand, gazing, till some double-sighted friend declares he sees it, until, by-and-by, it begins to dawn upon the sight of all, iu the shape of a narrow line, is if drawn along the horizon with a black-lead pencil. As you proceed on for an hour or so, the line becomes very, very gradually a little larger, till a knoll, like a pin point, rises upon it, and then some are fully convinced they are looking upon Lung Island, the first shadow of the mighty continent stretched out behind it. You scarcely believe it, till some time after you are pointed to look at the uhmistakeable villas on the beach. Yes, certainly, there they are! You now begin to think yourself near your destination. Then begins to crowd upon you the regret there will be of parting company with some very amiable friends you have become acquainted with, on the voyage out. You feel inclined, almost, to forget all about the rubbishing tea and coffee served up; you are inclined to forget all the tales of misery\u2014 aud something worse you have heard at the steerage end\u2014 but no, you think you are only endeavouring to render others, who"], [412, "26 ARRIVAL OFF STATEN ISLAND \u2014 CUSTOMS OFFICERS. come after you, more comfortable, by letting errors and wrongs be known, that in the future they should be rectified, when it can be done, most probably, at no extra cost to the owners, and who ought to thank you for letting them know of grievances which exist, which they would never hear of, but for such as you. Sailing up the channel, Fire Island lighthouse is pointed out to you on the right, about 30 miles from New York, and now land on both sides runs along each side. Sailing on, you approach towards Staten Island ; if in the evening, the last Dight's dancing is carried ou with extraordinary spirit. Even Mrs. Grundy has nothing to say, although she was sadly disappointed at Mr. Nobody sneaking off with the newspaper before she got a look at the births, deaths, and marriages, and to see if there was any truth in the horrid murder of old Bunkum's wife by old Bunkum himself, and then his own suicide afterwards. No, she would never forgive Mr. Nobody for that; however, she supposed they had newspapers in America, or, at all events, that they got, the \" Glasgow Herald\" from Glasgow, and that she could borrow the loan of it for \" tuppence,\" so as to have all \" news of the week\" to herself. It would occupy too much of our space to go into the details of all the incidents on board ship \u2014 and the many scenes of interest and pleasurable excitement, as well as danger, some times. Between what we have attempted to sketch, and the meals of breakfast, about 8, a. m. ; lunch, at 12, noon ; dinner, about 3, p. m., and supper, at 6 to 7,p. m., the passengers' thoughts are pretty well occupied the whole passage. A voyage across the Atlantic we take to be one of the best things in the world for a man who has never crossed, or who sees \" nothing in it\" in any thing at home. We fancy he will get his pulse raised occa sionally, and perhaps a little higher than he expected, but none the worse for it after all. In every voyage almost, we should sav, that friends are made, and acquaintanceships are formed which last forever afterwards ; and, generally speaking, after the first 3 or 4 days of the passage, a voyage across the Atlantic is capable of being made a delightful trip. ARRIVAL OFF STATEN ISLAND, OR QUARANTINE GROUND. We will now suppose you have arrived safe and well at your desired haven, and anchored off Staten Island. If in daylight, you will be much pleased (if in summer) with the ex ceeding beauty of the scenery all around, and the magnificent bay before you, where as many as 100 sail sometimes are to be seen lying at anchor. You will now be thinking about your luggage, etc., but previous to your starting up the river, the United States surgeon from the quarantine establishment on Staten Island, will make his appearance on board, as well as the custom-house officers, if they have not done so the moment you anchored. The doctor will examine all the steerage passengers and crew, and hear a report from the captain as to the health of his passengers. Any who are unwell and not able, or not thought advisable to proceed, are removed from the vessel, taken ashore at Staten Island, and placed in the lazaretto there until they are quite re covered. We may here allude to the quarantine establishment on Staten Island having been the scene of a disgraceful riot on the part of the inhabitants there, against the quarantine buildings, which they burned down last September, being afraid of yellow fever, or re ported cases of such being in the lazaretto there. They were anxious to get rid of the whole establishment, and used sword, pistol, and fire to accomplish their vicious purpose. The buildings, however, are to be rebuilt, the State government being determined that the quarantine establishment shall remain there, although to the annoyance of a few individuals. Having passed quarantine, you will now sail up the river, admiring, no doubt, the gor geous scenery on each side, and the immense river before you, when you arrive off the government emigration depot at Castle Garden. Before landing at New York, you will have to pass under the review of the United States custom-house officers, more particularly as to what you have with you in your packages."], [413, "EXAMINATION OF BAGGAGE. 27 EXAMINATION BY CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICERS. Before you are allowed to leave the vessel\u2014 supposing you to arrive at New York or some other port in the United States\u2014 with the custom house officers on board, the whole of the passengers' baggage will be hauled on deck, each passenger looking after his own, and get ting it all placed together. When you have got yours all in one place, be ready with the keys of your boxes, so as to open them when your turn comes, and exhibit the interior of them, and be ready to show that you have nothing you wish to conceal as being contra band, or liable to duty. Should you have any pieces of cloth, dress-pieces, or any thing of that sort, the best way is to show it, or say you have such, and the probability is, that, being intended to be made up for private use, they will pass it, although we believe they have a right to charge duty upon some sorts of such. We have seen some laughable cases in trying to evade the custom laws, and, as a sample, may mention the last, which was the case of a young lady, who, being desirous of smuggling in a dress-piece of merino, took the precaution to have it made up into a bustle. The sharp eye of the officer conceived the lady to be rather bulky in that part of her person, and the consequence was, the said young lady had to go to her cabin, undress, and deliver up what she had there. Her mortification was increased, when the officer told her, that if she had told him what she had, and that it was for private use, he would have allowed it to pass, but in her attempting to smuggle it into the country, he had no alternative but seize it. It is the worst thing possible, to try to evade the customs laws and duties. The officers will, generally speaking, be found to be in every respect disposed to give as little trouble as possible to emigrants and travellers. We have found them polite, ob liging, communicative, gentlemanly men, but quite up to their business, which is one very much apt to try even the temper of a saint, seeing the number of stupid people they have to deal with. By no means have any of your boxes nailed down, if you can help it. If you have, see that they are nailed with screw nails, and that you have with you a screw-driver, to un screw them, so as to have them ready for inspection. Any thing which is liable to duty \u2014 or packages suspected of containing such \u2014 is gen erally marked P. S., meaning that it is to go the Public Store for inspection. Any of yours so marked, you will inquire of the officers where to apply for it. The luggage of the cabin passenger has to undergo the same process as that belonging to the steerage passenger. After the steerage passenger's luggage has been passed, and they, with their luggage, have left the ship for Castle Garden depot, the vessel, isa steamer, will, most probably, move up the river to her wharf, to discharge her cabin passengers. The instructions given regarding the passing of luggage of steerage passengers applies to cabin passengers \u2014 only cabin passengers will get no checks, as their baggage is not put off from the ship, but remains on board till they disembark at the Wharf, unless when they are disembarked before the steerage passengers, and landed at the Custom-house quay. Even then, they get no checks. CHECKING BAGGAGE AFTER IT IS PASSED THE CUSTOMS. Supposing that you have got your baggage passed on board ship, all right, one of the officers will hand you what is called a \" baggage-check,\" being a small brass ticket, with a certain number on it. You keep that check or ticket He places another one attached to a leather strap upon your baggage, having the same number as the one he gave you. For every separate article which yon have, you will get one of these checks, every one will have a different number, each check and number corresponding with the check and number affixed to your package. After you have got these checks, you need be under no apprehension about your baggage, as the party who gave you the checks will look after it,"], [414, "28 CASTLE GARDEN EMIGRATION DEPOT. and will not deliver it up till he gets from you (or some one else) the checks with the num bers corresponding to those upon your luggage ; so that no one can get your luggage without having such checks or tickets, and being able to tell your name, and the name of the ship you came by. You will see, however, the importance of taking care of your \" baggage checks,\" and see that you get one for every package you have. If you are an emigrant or steerage passenger, and arrive at New York, the luggage will be conveyed to the emigrant depot \u2014 viz., a round house close at hand \u2014 what is called \" Castle Garden.\" You accompany it to that place, where you will receive any informa tion you may require. This establishment belongs to the United States Government, and is a mo6t excellent one for the protection of the emigrant, for whose benefit it is carried on. CASTLE GARDEN, NEW YORK. The establishment of Castle Garden depot is an institution most creditable to the United States Government Emigration Commissioners \u2014 alike in its objects, its management \u2014 in the incalculable amount of protection it affords to every emigrant who arrives in New York against plunder and swindling of every description, and the interest it takes in the emi grant, and the assistance it renders him. No one can properly appreciate what those services are, unless he had been witness to the truly fearful scenes which occurred on the landing of a ship-load of emigrants, with their baggage, previous to its establishment. It would take up too much of our space to explain every thing which is done for the emigrant th'tre. If we say, that there he is received by kind and attentive friends, who will 6ee that he is not plundered, either in the establishment or out of it, if they can prevent it \u2014 who will see that he gets proper tickets to his destination, and pays no more for them than he ought to do ? \u2014 if sick, assist him into a humane infirmary, and keep him there free of expense till he is better \u2014 see that he goes to a boarding-house where himself and property will he safe, and who wil! lend him money, even, to enable him to get to his destination \u2014 we say no more than the actual truth. The moment a ship stops opposite Castle Garden, an officer from it goes on board, and there takes charge of all emigrants' baggage, giving them \" checks\" for it. We will suppose that you are about to arrive in New York. After leaving the ship, you proceed in a large barge, or steamer, to Castle Garden landing. On landing, you will be thown the way into the interior Qf the building. Entered it, you proceed to a desk, where the \" Registrar\" sits, with a book before him, in which he enters your name, where you are from, and to where you are going. You are then passed on to another clerk at the same table, to whom you mention where you are going. He will then give you a small printed slip, filled up with all the particulars which you have told him : and suppose, for instance, that you are going to Chicago, you take that printed slip to another desk, where the clerk will furnish you with tickets which will take you to Chicago. Whilst you have been registering yourself, and getting your tickets, the baggage has, in the mean time, been taken from the steamer, and safely secured in the \" baggage depart ment\" of the establishment. If you wish to get it at once \u2014 or whenever you do wish to git it \u2014 you apply at a window, in another portion of the building, where you will observe \" English Luggage\" painted upon it On the production of your baggage-checks your bag gage will be brought and handed to you, when you then give up your checks. If you have lost or mislaid your baggage-checks, you will not be able to get it without delay and trouble. Previous to your leaving, get your baggage taken to the weighmaster, to have it weigh ed ; that is, supposing you are proceeding into the country by rail. Your baggage is there weighed, and for every pound weight which you have above 50 lbs.* you will have to pay \u00bb The charge for carriage of baggage, over the 50 lbs. weight allowed free, is about 20 cents (Vid. stg.) per 100 lbs., for every hundred miles. Thus, 100 lbs. weight for 1200 miles, will cost 42.40 (or 9\u00bb. 8d. stg.)."], [415, "THE ARRANGEMENTS AT CASTLE GARDEN. 29 so much per 100 lbs. for freight\u2014 the rate being according to distance\u2014 the railway com panies not allowing any more than 50 lbs. weight free to each passenger. Afer you have got it weighed, you get a printed certificate, stating the weight, and how much you will have to pay\u2014 of over-weight The weighmaster will then receive the money for over weight from you, provide you with a printed slip, stating that you have paid so much, and how many packages you have, and the number upon them\u2014 so that you run no risk what ever, on your journey, of being imposed upon in any way\u2014 your tickets, per rail and steamer, and your ticket respecting your baggage, being all you require. Your luggage thus in safe keeping at Castle Garden\u2014 and your tickets in your pocket\u2014 you are ready to be con veyed to the railroad station or steamboat wharf. Yourself and baggage is taken there free, and thus you are started on to your destination \u2014 having, thus far. experienced more attention than you would have received from some friends, probably. If you remain in New York any time, see that you do not, in company \u2014 probably with other emigrants \u2014 get your baggage-checks mixed with theirs \u2014 as is sometimes done \u2014 to the future annoyance of yourself and the authorities at Castle Garden\u2014 who will only deliver up the baggage for the checks having the corresponding numbers on them. We may mention, that, in the baggage department, there are, sometimes, as many as 4000 trunks, boxes, and \" pieces\" of baggage, of one sort or another, and yet all are so methodically entered in their books and numbered off into the baggage sheds, that any one piece can be found at once \u2014 its locality being known by a certain letter and number upon it. It frequently happens that emigrants arrive with, probably, not one penny in their pockets\u2014 friends who have, perhaps, shipped them off, from Europe, not considering or caring how they are to reach their destination \u2014 or if \" booked through\" with tickets which may be right, or wrong, did not consider what such unfortunate emigrant was to do for food on his journey, after arrival here. In that case, the Castle Garden authori ties do not allow him to starve \u2014 but they see what baggage he has got. According to the value of it, they advance him a certain amount of money \u2014 upon the understanding that when he gets to his destination, he will remit the money to their superintendent, as soon as he can. Although it should be 6, 9, 12, 18 months, or even 2 years, not one farthing is charged for interest. We had the curiosity to look over the pages of this loan-book, and it shows most praiseworthy specimens of honesty on the part of the poorer classes who received such temporary assistance. The sums lent, averaged from $2 to $50 (8s. to \u00a310 stg.). Out of 33 names on every page, many pages were clean paid up ; and the excep. tion seemed to be to the extent of 1 or 2 in every 33 not yet refunded. Until the money is refunded the baggage is retained. When the money is advanced, so much is advanced in tickets, to destination \u2014 and so much in money. We may mention, that a sum of about $5000 (or \u00a31000 stg.) is kept continually as a floating debt\u2014 in this manner \u2014 in relieving the necessities of the poor and unfortunate, in the manner described. Another feature in the establishment, is, taking care of children, who are sent out alone, by friends \u2014 with no money, or food, and with no other address than \" America\" \u2014 as if it was some small village they were sent to. On the occasion of our visit, we were shown a little boy and his sister \u2014 from 8 to 10 years of age \u2014 who had arrived thus from Ireland. In no instance is the real philan thropy of the establishment better shown than in such cases. These two interesting little things had travelled fully 3000 miles \u2014 to search for their father in a country. some 3,000,000 miles in area, and not a person to care for them on arrival. No letters for them, about them, or with them. There they were, under the protecting care of the establishment, who was seeing that, at least, they had the necessaries of life and a home. They had called in the assistance of the Catholic priesthood \u2014 who render most valuable assistance in all such cases \u2014 and by their means, and advertising for the parent, they may find him \u2014 and when he is found, these two little children will be forwarded per rail, or steamer, probably 1500 miles, with a label fastened round their bodies showing their destination, and to be forwarded, like express parcels, till they reach there. If such an"], [416, "30 CASTLE GARDEN \u2014 NEW YORK. establishment did nothing more than that, in such cases, it would be worthy of all com mendation. Emigrants arriving \u2014 expecting to meet friends, and disappointed \u2014 others, who expect letters, and are disappointed \u2014 others, wishing to write to friends, but who cannot write \u2014 others, who receive letters, but who cannot read them \u2014 and all such cases, meet with every assistance and the best advice in Castle Garden. There are no beds fitted up, or furniture, same as a hotel ; but emigrants, whose means are limited, sleep on the floor and benches of the premises \u2014 having bedding, etc., of their own \u2014 which they are privileged to use in particular portions of the building . Such privilege is largely taken advantage of. Sometimes as many as 2000 have been known to sleep under its hospitable roof at one time, rather than go and spend their scanty means in a boarding-house for the short time they are to be there. In another portion of the building, provisions \u2014 such as milk, bread, cheese, with sau sages, tea and coffee, etc., either cooked or otherwise \u2014 are supplied; and we ean bear tes timony to the very superior quality of every article supplied \u2014 and at the lowest possible prices. Families can there buy their tea and coffee, and cook it for themselves, at the large cooking stove in the kitchen set aside for that purpose, where hot water, fire, etc., etc., is supplied, free of charge, besides the use of washing-rooms in another part of the building. Emigrants, on their arrival at Castle Garden, undergo an examination by the govern ment surgeon, to see that none of the \" lame, the halt, or the blind,\" are landing, so as likely to become a public charge \u2014 or others who are unwell, and require to be sent to the hospital at Ward's Island, close at hand. Castle Garden was established in the year 1855, by the Government Emigration Commissioners, as a forwarding emigration depot, and we wish it to be understood, that in the imperfect sketch we have here given of it, it is impos sible for any one to conceive the large amount of good it has done \u2014 and is doing every day \u2014 to the poor, the ignorant, the needy, and the helpless stranger, as he arrives on those shores. Much as one hears of the undoubted philanthropy and benevolence of Eng land \u2014 with the occasional side-winded sneers which are levelled by some parties, in their ignorance, at America, her institutions, and people, when they bear of any thing, from which they may take a lesson \u2014 it occurs to us, that Great Britain has something yet to do, in the way of affording some such protection and assistance to the poor, igno rant, and penniless stranger who lands on her shores, and out of the books of Castle Gar den, in republican New York, we think she may take a lesson or two with some advan tage. If, therefore, you, as an emigrant, arrive at Castle Garden, you have only to ask for in formation and you will get it. If you live outside of it, for a day or two, you should leave your baggage inside, checked ; have your checks with you \u2014 but on no account, whatever, give them up to hotel-keepers, boarding-house keepers, or in fact to any one, as, if you do, it may be the last you will 6ee either of checks or baggage \u2014 as, by producing your baggage checks at Castle Garden, your baggage may be got by any one. There are 3 boarding-houses where British emigrants, and 3 others where German emi grants can be recommended to go, on applying to the officers of Castle Garden, and hotels are also recommended to 6uit the means of each individual. Castle Garden, inside, has the appearance of a circus, with a seated gallery, or Bort of amphitheatre all round it \u2014 with doors opening out on a terrace, which goes round the building \u2014 and from which one of the finest views of the river and opposite shore is to be had. The building was used, formerly, as a fort at one time \u2014 at another, as a circus \u2014 at another, as a theatre \u2014 as well as for public meetings. Now it is a permanent institution, devoted by the Commissioners of Emigration to a most worthy purpose. The superintendent of Castle Garden is Mr. John A. Kennedy \u2014 to whom we are in debted for the foregoing information \u2014 and who has our thanks for the attention and trou ble he took to explain all particulars respecting this truly noble institution. Emigrants"], [417, "31 CASTLE GARDEN \u2014 ARRIVAL AT NEW YORK. can send messages, or letters to Mr. Kennedy's care, and he will see them attended to, regarding any passenger who is expected by any particular vessel. In this way emigrants receive messages from their friends before they leave the ship. He receives, on an average, 25 to 30 letters every day \u2014 pertaining to emigrants and their affairs \u2014 which will give some idea of its immense public utility. After all, however, Castle Garden has its enemies, in the runners, low boarding-houses, etc., outside of it, and the proprietors of property in the neighbourhood, whose incomes have been lessened by the nefarious trades of such \"rowdy\" establishments being \"done up,\" by the establishment of Castle Garden. Castle Garden is supported by the \"head money\" of $2 levied on every emigrant, which is paid by the ship, and a percentage of 20 per cent they derive from the tickets they supply, which percentage the passenger does not pay for, it being the usual commis sion allowed by the railway and forwarding companies, for the sale of tickets to agents. The tickets of every conveyance company are sold within the premises. ARRIVAL AT NEW YORK. Supposing that you are now about to set foot on American soil, for the first time, a few hints may be useful. You want, no doubt, to go to a hotel. If you have not made up your mind what hotel to go to, or that none of the passengers, whose acquaintance you have made, know of any ; but whether you have made their acquaintance or not, and they can tell you \u2014 your best plan is to ask the purser of the ship to give you the name of a respectable hotel \u2014 ac cording to your means \u2014 or consult the list of hotels in New York, in this work \u2014 all of which are respectable. (See article on \" Hotels in America.\") If in a steamer, the purser, or captain, will be obliging enough to tell you all they know. Before, therefore, you leave the ship, have your mind made up to go direct to one house, or another, and when once made up your mind to go there \u2014 allow no stranger to persuade you to go elsewhere. By all means avoid what are called \" runners.\" (See our notice of this class of public pests.) You are now all ready to go on shore, perhaps. Well, you will find a lot of cabs, or \"hacks,\" yierhaps some omnibuses, and a lot of \" express carts,\" ready to convey you and your luggage to a hotel. Cabs are most expensive, sometimes, so that the man of ordina ry means very often hires an express cart. The charge for a cart is about 25 cents \u2014 equal to a quarter of a dollar (or Is. stg.) for every package. You may be asked eo many shillings \u2014 one, two, three, or four shillings, as the case may be ; but recollect that it is what are called York shillings that are meant, and that is just so many sixpences stg. One York shilling being the same as one sixpence stg., and one sixpence York means three-pence stg. Before now, we presume, you have studied our remarks on American coins, and their value in sterling money. Make a bargain with either cabman, or express-cart driver, for the fare, recollecting, that almost all such are ready to get as much as they can from you. For a cab, 2s. stg. is about the fare from the ship to the hotel, unless it is an extraordinary long way off, and few of which are so in New York ; luggage extra. It you hire an express cart, get a ticket from the driver \u2014 with his name and address. Keep it. See that he places all your luggage on his cart \u2014 and that no one but him carries it on shore for you. Seeing it safely, and all right, on his cart\u2014 he will drive you up also \u2014 or you can walk, following the eart>\u2014 (best to ride with him)\u2014 to the house you stop at. If any of your fellow passengers will join you in engaging an express cart, it will lessen the cost to each \u2014 depending altogether upon the bargain made. Sometimes omnibuses, from some of the large hotels, are in attendance. You will Bee the name of the hotel marked on the omnibus. In case you have made up your mind, to try a\u00bbd get employment in New York, we"], [418, "32 SEARCHING FOR EMPLOYMENT. may make a few remarks, for your guidance, in looking out for work\u2014 supposing that you have no acquaintance there. SEARCHING FOR EMPLOYMENT. On your arrival in this country as an emigrant, and at the town where you purpose set tling, yon are probably desirous of securing a situation. In getting a situation, you may not succeed so soon as you would like, and from the fact of your being a stranger and never having worked in this country, you will, ou that ac count, not succeed so soon as you would otherwise do. The most important advice we can give is, for you to make up your mind at once to take the very first situation which offers, no matter what it is, as, once in employment, you will have weekly wages coming in, and be in a position to improve upon the situation you have obtained, by keeping your eyes open. In other words, take a situation, however me nial it may be considered at home, and make it a stepping-stone to something better and more to your mind. No description of labour in this country is considered menial, and looked upon in the same light as it is in Britain. You ought to remember, that the man who earns an honest living \u2014 for instance, by casting the walking-beam of a steam-engine \u2014 is considered just as good a man (so far as working and respectability goes) as the man who shovels out gold and siiver over a bank counter. In fact, if there is any difference in the two, the producer of wealth is looked upon as a more valuable man than the mere dis tributor of it. We will illustrate what we wish to convey to the minds of the working classes who may come here, trying to find employment, by giving the case of a moulder, who came out here some 3 years ago, with a wife and young family. He was a first-rate workman, and a sober man. For 3 weeks that man searched and re-searched all over the city of New York in quest of employment as a moulder, but could get no employment. His means get ting low, his case was a serious one, as may be supposed; something was required to be done. He was told, if he asked to fill a vacancy, as a moulder only, he might never get a situa tion, but if he would ask for employment of any description, and be ready to take it where he called at, he might find it. Necessity compelled him to take the advice, and the next day he got a job to pick cinders in a yard at a dollar (4s.) per day. The foundry where he called at had no room for a moulder then, but offered him the situation to pick cinders. Although inclined inwardly to turn up his nose at the offer, he was glad to accept it, and for two months did he remain doing nothing else. After that time, he got a situation in the moulding-shop, and from low wages he rose to $12 (or 48s.) per week, and it is now well on for 3 years since he entered that, foundry, a very steady workman, under good em ployers. It will be seen, therefore, that this man had been going for 3 weeks \"on the wrong track\" in trying to get employment, and it is that, very thing which we wish to impress upon the minds of all who wish to get a situation, viz., to take the first which offers, if it should even be to drive a coal-cart, or, like the moulder, to \" pick cinders.\" Once in a situation, you will find ways and means to get another, and a better one. So long as you are out of employment, and never having been in any situation here, you may remain out forever, if you go upon the wrong plan in trying to get it, or too fastidious about the nature of the employment when offered to you. We have known of compositors, again, when no place was to be got in a case-room, take a job at \" feeding\" a printing-machine, but who were not long at that, before they were up in the case-room at good wages. Our remarks apply to all classes generally : the draper, if he cannot get a situation as a salesman, may be glad to take one as a light porter at first, and so on in other trades and professions. Never lose the chance in making a start, in some way or other, when you have it The same remarks apply, in trying to find employment, in any city or town."], [419, "BAGGAGE CHECKING WHEN TRAVELLING. 33 Supposing that you are about travelling to a distance, we will now explain a few neces sary particulars regarding baggage-checking. BAGGAGE AND BAGGAGE-CHECKS. In travelling through America, the stranger from Great Britain will find a most excel lent system in operation for taking care of passengers' luggage, (or baggage, as it is univer sally called here,) and one which relieves the traveller from all further concern or trouble about it after he has taken his passage on board steamer or on the railroad \u2014 a system very much superior to any thing that we have ever seen in Great Britain, excepting from Lon don to Brighton, or London to Paris. When you arrive at a railroad station, and after you have got your ticket, you apply to have your baggage checked to your destination. Suppose you wish to go from New York to Albany, you inform the baggage-master at the station, whom you will see with a lot of leather straps, with two brass tickets on each, hung over his arm. E. ch of those tickets on the strap has the same number stamped on them. The one ticket is loose, and the other fixed to the strap. You tell him you are going to Albany, and show him what packages you have. Each package ie called a \" piece,\" in America. Suppose you have 3 packages or pieces; he takes one of the straps from off his arm, slips off the loose brass ticket and gives it to you, with, say No. 1000 upon it, the duplicate of that he fixes upon one of your packages with the strap to it. He then gives you another ticket or check, No. 1001 upon it, and fixes another strap and check upon it, with same number, upon your second pack age ; and for the third package he gives you check No. 1002 upon it, and fixes a strap, with a check with same number, on it, and so on. After you have thus received your checks, your baggage is \" checked through ;\" you have nothing further to do with it, and require to give yourself no more trouble about it, as no one, not even yourself, can get the baggage without delivering up the checks. Arrived at your destination, you deliver up the checks, or, if you give them to a cab man or omnibus conductor, he will get your baggage and deliver it wherever you like. In some cases, travellers cannot get their baggage checked further than certain points. For example, emigrants going from New York or Albany to Chicago \u2014 some 1200 miles off \u2014 and going via Suspension Bridge (Niagara Falls), get their baggage checked only to Sus pension Bridge. On arrival there, the baggage has to be re-checked, that is, the same pro cess gone through as at starting, to wherever you are bound for, or as far as it can be checked to, from there. When getting your checks, you must ascertain how far your baggage is checked \u2014 if no checked to your destination \u2014 and when yon get to the station to which it is checked, get it re-checked forward. In some cases, parties may travel upwards of 1000 miles, and have their baggage checked only once all the way, and have no trouble about it. Who will say that this system is not superior to a general scramble for luggage on arrival at a station, and some sharper, perhaps, walking off in a hurry with your portmanteau, simply because he may be the proprietor of it, for any thing the guard or porter at the railway station may know to the contrary. No luggage is taken in charge by the \" baggage-master,\" on a train or boat, without be iug checked. INTELLIGENCE OFFICES. The stranger, seeing the sign up, \" Intelligence Office,\" would be apt to suppose it to be some benevolent institution for directing the stranger to any particular place, or afford ing information regarding any thing he might want to know about the city. Tho Intelligence Office has no such mission to fulfil, but simply, in some cases, to find employers for servants, and servants for employers \u2014 being what is called in England a \" Servant's Registry.\" Entering, for curiosity, one day into one of these Intelligence Offices in New"], [420, "34 EXPRESSION OF OPINION IN AMERICA. York, we found upwards of 150 females \u2014 of all ages and 6izes \u2014 waiting to be hired, all seated on forms\u2014 some with the fresh hue of the Green Isle upon their swarthy faces, and others with the sallow complexion of veteran \" New Yorkers.\" The proprietor of the estab lishment has his regular customers \u2014 in the shape of hotel keepers and families \u2014 who pay him so much per annum to keep them supplied with \" help,\" and when one servant is dis charged, all that is necessary is to 6end to the Intelligence Office for another likely hand. In some, establishments, no fee is charged to the servant ; in others, there is a fee charged when a situation is obtained. In certain cities in the west, however, the term \" Intelligence Office\" means a pawn broking establishment as well \u2014 in some of which it is not very safe to pledge any thing which you may wish to recover when you want it. EXPRESSION OF OPINION BY STRANGERS IN AMERICA. We will now presume that you have got comfortably \" located\" in some of the cities and towns in this country. A few hints, by way of reminding you of your position, and for your future guidance, may not be out of place here. First of all, then, it will be best for you to remember that your position is that of a for eigner in this country \u2014 and you need think it nothing strange if you are looked upon as such by the natives of America, and that they look upon you in a similar light, and with similar feelings, to what you or others in Great Britain may have looked upon Americans, or other foreigners, who have settled there. To all intents and purposes, therefore, you are a foreigner here, and it will be better for you to remember that fact, and act and express yourself in a manner becoming a foreigner, who has a great deal to learn regarding the customs, habits of the people, laws of the country, and courtesies of every-day life which are observed, as well as regards politics. For some considerable time, therefore, after your arrival, we would advise you to be more of a listener than a talker upou public mat ters here \u2014 particularly the politics of the counfry \u2014 as we have little doubt that you would consider the Frenchman or the German, who, only after a short residence in Great Britain, and not understanding \u2014 or understanding very imperfectly \u2014 the politics and various mat ters connected with government there, not very well qualified to express a proper opinion on such a subject, and should he be presumptive enough to do so in a dictatorial, bullying, or offensive manner, you would be apt to look upon him as an imprudent, blustering, ignorant fellow. Should you, therefore, act a similar part here \u2014 as the European foreigner alluded to in Great Britain \u2014 you need not think it strange, if you should be looked upon in the same light, also, although you may not be told so, perhaps, so out-spokenly as you would tell the foreigner at home. You may see many things which are different from what you have been accustomed to, and observe things done in a different manner to which you have seen them done in Great Britain \u2014 but, depend upon it, before you are long in the country, you will find out that things exist here in a condition \u2014 speaking generally \u2014 best suited for the people, climate, and other circumstances of the country. In matters of politics, particularly, you will do well to be careful how you express your self, until you understand the many phases of politics and political life which exist in this country, and to understand that, is not the work of either weeks or months. Regarding the question of slavery, for example, upon which you have been brought up to hold certain opinions, you will find it to your advantage to be as silent upon that topic as possible, although you will find thousands who quite agree with you in your detestation of it, and coincide with you in opinion generally. Connected with this matter, as you no doubt are aware, a great agitation is, and has been, on foot in this country amongst Americans them selves, in favour of its abolition. It being a question of such magnitude, and one of the social institutions of the country, you had better allow the agitation of its abolition, therefore and the whole question respecting it, to be settled by the Americans themselves, more particu larly if you are only a transient visitor in the country. If you are a settler, and have be"], [421, "VALUE OF AMERICAN MONEY. 35 come a citizen\u2014 have resided five years in the country, and become naturalized \u2014 and have an interest and stake in the country, then, but not till then, will it be prudent for you to take any active part in such matters. By calmly listening to both sides of the question when you hear it discussed, or reading and judging for yourself from what you will see printed regarding it in this country, you will be all the better able to understand that subject, as well as others of a social and political character, when you are a naturalized citizen of the country, and entitled to express your opinion, and advocate your views, as well as any one. If you have strong feelings upon any particular subjects, such as slavery, you must recollect that Americans have, also strong feelings, and although differing from you in opinion, and being natives of the country, they are entitled to all respect from you, a comparative stranger here, and who, consequently, cannot be so well \" posted up\" in such matters, until, as we have said before, you have been some considerable time in the country. Our remarks apply more particularly to cases where you find yourself in the midst of a miscellaneous company \u2014 where the subject is being discussed, and advocated for and against. If you are in the company of an intelligent and well-bred American alone, you may, if occasion requires it, express your opinion with all freedom ; and you will find by doing so, in a gentlemanly and becoming manner, you will be met in the same spirit On the other hand, you may meet with abolitionists, with whom you may find your self at home, and agree with on this much-vexed question. We would have you to bear in mind, also, the fact, that many who have come to this country with very strong anti slavery ideas and sentiments, have, after a residence of some years, had their preconceived notions very much modified, and, in some cases, totally changed on the subject, more particu larly as to the modus operand; by which slavery is to be abolished. Some clergymen, even, who were red-hot anti-slavery advocates in Great Britain, are now actually holders of slaves \u2014 some of them belonging to the sects of religionists who are considered the most strict \u2014 a proof what the change of circumstances, and where self-interest is concerned, will effect in the sentiments of individuals. MONEY OF AMERICA. In the United States, the currency is in dollars and cents. The copper coin, consists of a one-cent piece only. It is of two sizes \u2014 the newest being about the size of a British farthing \u2014 but thicker and with a half silvery appearance. The old cent piece is of cop per, not unlike, a halfpenny. The silver coins consist of pieces denominated \u2014 3 cents, or l^c. stg. ; 5 cents, (half dime,) or 2-Jrf. stg. ; 10 cents, (one dime,) 5d. stg. ; 25 cents, (about Is. stg.,) or J- dollar ; 50 cents, (half dollar,) or 2s. stg. ; and one dollar, or 4s. stg. The gold coins consist of $1, one dollar, or 4s. stg. ; $2.50, or two dollars and half, 10s. stg., (called \u00a3 eagle); $3, three dollars, or 12s. stg. ; $5, five dollars, or i eagle, 20s. stg. ; $10, ten dollars, or one eagle, 40s. stg. ; $20, twenty dollars, \u00a34 stg. ; and $50, fifty dol lars, \u00a310 stg. As explained elsewhere, the above is not the value you will get in the States for British money \u2014 as there is the difference of exchange to be deducted, when you come to change it here. Only, the foregoing, with the annexed tables, will explain all that is generally necessary to be known, more particularly in Great Britain. In addition to the above, there are old Mexican silver pieces in circulation, which are good enough, to those who know them ; but if you do not know them, you had better re fuse taking them in change \u2014 as you may take some \" bogus\" money by mistake. In Canada, you will have three currencies to count by\u2014 the British currency, the Halifax currency, (used in Canada,) and the American currency. There is no doubt but that the American currency is the easiest and simplest to transact business by \u2014 being much easier to count by tens than any other. The currency in Canada is now assimilated by law to that of the United States, and is cer-"], [422, "36 BRITISH, AMERICAN, AND CANADIAN CURRENCY. tainly a change for the better. All accounts in banks and government offices are now kept there in dollars and cents. To enable you to know, however, the relative value of the three currencies, we append tables which, we hope, will be found useful, and easily understood. In the government offices, such as post-offices, etc., no bank bills are taken as payment, and they are very particular in refusing defaced coins ; so act accordingly. You will find, in travelling, that the small $1 pieces are very handy \u2014 only you require to have them in a bag or something by themselves, otherwise you may lose them, as they are scarcely the size of silver 3d. piece. Carry no bank notes of one State with you into another State. Bankers do not take, on deposit account, the notes of any bank out of the State they re side in. You must, therefore, take them to a broker, and get him to give you gold, or proper notes for them, with as small \" a shave\" as possible for his trouble. York money is thus denominated \u2014 threepence, stg., is 6d York; sixpence, stg., is Is. York; one shilling, 6tg., is 2s. York, and so on. When asked the price of any thing in shillings and sixpences, always conclude it is York money which is meant. Penny pieces should not be brought to America, as they go only for one cent each. Half crowns and crowns should not be brought. Shillings, sixpences, and halfpence are more useful than some \u2014 but American coins are the best to bring, if you can get them. The British shilling is worth 22 cents; twenty shillings, stg., is worth four dollars and eighty-three or four cents.

The postal arrangements in America differ very materially from those of Great Britain. In many places, in America, there are no deliveries of letters at their addresses \u2014 unless you make special request for such to be done, and pay, in addition, 2 cents for every let ter you receive. There are no city or town deliveries on the same regular organized plan of the postal system of Britain, excepting in such cities as New York, and even there it is conducted differently. When you expect a letter \u2014 presuming you have made no agree ment for its delivery \u2014 you call at the post-office, and there inquire if there are any letters for you. At the end of each week, a list is made out of all letters, lying unclaimed, at the post-office. That list is published in the principal newspapers on Saturday, or Sun day. You may there find your name advertised \u2014 in the \"ladies'\" or \" gentlemen's\" list. If so advertised, you call at a window, at the post-office, and ask for your letter, stating that it is an \" advertised letter.\" When you get it, you pay one cent. The fact of your, perhaps, living a long way from a post-office, aud not knowing there are letters for you there, they may remain at the post-office for weeks and months. After the expiration of three months, letters in the United States are sent to the dead office of the postal depart ment at Washington City, and there opened. If they contain nothing valuable, they are destroyed. If they contain any thing of value, the writer is communicated with, and, probably, he may recover the same. This system is the same throughout all the United States. Men in business have boxes at the post-office \u2014 each one with a specific number \u2014 for which they pay a trifle per annum. In some cities there are locked boxes \u2014 others are mere \" pigeon holes\" \u2014 except ing at the New York post-office. All are arranged in the lobby of the post-office, with a number painted on each, running from number 1 to thousands. These square boxes are covered with glass in front, and when letters are placed in them, it is seen at once, by those calling, whether there are any for them. If there are any, they ask at the window for them. The addresses of all letters in such boxes, are turned downwards \u2014 so that the curious, in the lobby of the post-office, cannot tell whose letters are in particular numbered boxes. The locked boxes are square, wooden boxes \u2014 the party paying for one, having a key with which he opens it each time he calls for his letters, or papers. The stranger, who expects a letter at any particular town, must call every day \u2014 till he gets it \u2014 as there are no other means of knowing whether there is one, or not \u2014 unless he happens to see it ad vertised, at the end of the week, as already explained. It will at once be seen, by those who have been accustomed to have their letters regularly delivered at their addresses, in Great Britain, that the system here, is very dif ferent, and not so convenient, besides being more expensive. In addition to the government post-offices in cities, private enterprise steps in, and, so far as letters for town delivery go, they take the place of the regular post-office \u2014 to a large extent. These offices are called \" Dispatch Offices.\" If you wish to send a letter to a friend in the city, you pre-pay it with two cents, at one of these dispatch offices, and it is delivered, in a few hours afterwards, free, just as if it was dropped into one of the sub offices in London, at 10, A. m., it would be delivered by 12, or 2, p. m. These parties em ploy messengers, who have regular deliveries during each day. When not pre-paid, the party who receives the letter through them pays the 2 cents for the same. No mails travel here on Sundays during the day time. When on their route from a dis tance, mail trains lay over from Saturday night till early on Monday morning, or start late on Sunday night, so as to make connections with other trains on Monday morning, some 200 or 300 miles off. There are no money order offices, in the United States, similar to what are in Great Britain and in Canada. We annex the present rates of postage. It is of importance to notice, that no inland let ters will be forwarded to any part of the States, unless pre-paid."], [427, "BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES. \u25a01: UNITED STATES INLAND POSTAGE PRESENT RATES OF POSTAGE.

NATIONAL BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES. In all large cities in the United States and Canada, there are three leading benevolent institutions connected with Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 which are calculated to do an im mense deal of good. They are styled \u2014 The St George's, St. Andrew's, and St. Patrick's Societies. St. George's Society is managed by Englishmen, and is intended to aid exclusively such who are desirous of obtaining pecuniary assistance, or in procuring employment, or advice what to do under particular circumstances. St. Andrew's Society is managed by Scotchmen, with the same objects as the foregoing \u2014 towards Scotchmen only. St. Patrick's Society is managed by Irishmen, with the same objects towards Irishmen only. Each society is managed by a board of directors, under a president, or vice-president, with secretary, treasurer, etc., etc. Any emigrant, desirous of getting advice, can easily ascertain, in any city or town, the name and address of an officer of the society representing the country he belongs to. Emigrants ought to bear in mind, however, that, these gentlemen receive no payment for their services ; and, consequently, whilst desirous of assisting their countrymen all in their power, the recipients of their kindness ought to give no more trouble than is actually necessary. Whilst you may, from necessity, be obliged to ask the advice of the philanthropic gen tlemen alluded to, there are another class of men, however, whom we would warn you specially to avoid, and that is, runners."], [428, "42 RUNNERS. RUNNERS. Ir there is one class of pests in human form, more annoying and dangerous than another, to strangers, on their arrival, it is runners. You will find them infesting all steamboat wharves, and railway stations about large cities. A runner is a man who is de sirous of assisting you with your baggage, who professes to know a great deal, and who advises you to go to a particular hotel, eating-house, or boarding-house, with which he is connected. In reality, he belongs to a class of tormentors, cheats, and money-suckers\u2014 as annoying, and far more dangerous, than if you were threatened with an attack by a wolf \u2014 offered up to the stings of a hive of wasps, or seduced into the folds of a rattlesnake. At no city are they so numerous, probably, as at New York, although they are to be found everywhere \u2014 at the same time it is perfectly easy, if prepared, to withstand their attacks. On arrival, you will find them, perhaps, shouting out the names of the hotels they represent, scrambling for your luggage and, if possible, dragging it and your self off along w-ith them. In another form they will approach you quietly, but annoying ly, insisting that you should go with them, to their house In another form, and most dangerous of all \u2014 in the character of a friend \u2014 with the intentions of a fiend and one object in view, viz., plunder. We refer, more particularly, to their attacks upon the unsuspecting emigrant, who has, probably, just arrived from some agricultural district in Great Britain, Ireland, or Germany, and as \"verdant\" as the hills he has left. With the keen eye of his species, does this professional robber attack the emigrant under the guise of being from the \" old country,\" and by such artifice ingratiate himself into his confi dence, ascertain all about his affairs, what money he has, where he has it, and at last suc ceed, perhaps, in decoying him into some boarding-house\u2014 of which he is the paid run ner. Landed there, probably, with a wife and children, and baggage, the emigrant finds out, before he leaves \u2014 if ever he finds it out \u2014 that he has paid extra for every article he has had in the house, simply because the runner took him there, and had to receive a per centage on all he spent there. To recount the nefarious doings of these prowling harpies \u2014 ever ready to pounce upon their unwary prey, under, as we have said, the guise of friendship \u2014 would literally re quire volumes. We have only space to earnestly advise all emigrants, and tourists, to iiavk nothing, whatever, to Do with them, or with any stranger, whatever, in offers of assist ance, as, probably, the man you take to be a stranger and with good intentions, is only a runner, in another of their seductive forms. It will appear all the more surprising when we state the fact, that the most of all these runners arc from Great Britain and Ireland, originally \u2014 many of them being Irish \u2014 who have found themselves unable to earn an honest living at any thing else, and who, proba bly, in their coming to this country, were fleeced themselves, on their arrival, by some countryman, whose degrading example they now follow. Avoid all such, therefore, as you would avoid a plague. Some respectable hotels have porters in attendance on steamboats and trains, but they generally have an omnibus also, for passengers, into which you may go \u2014 presuming you have made up your mind what hotel you are going to. Some have, generally, a badge on their hat, or cap \u2014 although the runners we have referred to, have the same. Unless you give your baggage, or checks, to an express agent \u2014 (see Express Companies) \u2014 don't lose sight of your baggage till you see it on the omnibus you are going with, and landed at the hotel you are going to. Runners are frequently the cause of robberies of person and property \u2014 so we presume we have said enough for you to avoid them on all occasions. They are employed, also, by \" ticket agents,\" to take passengers to secure tickets by steamers, and railroads, at particu lar offices, and which are \" bogus,\" or swindles \u2014 such tickets being worthless. Never a day passes, we believe, but some unfortunate passenger is thus cheated. His only resource is \u2014 the police \u2014 to hunt them up, and get back the money, if possible."], [429, "RAILROAD TICKETS \u2014 WORKING CLASSES. 43 RAILROAD TICKETS. The tickets issued on some lines of rail are good only for the one journey, as they uni versally are in Great Britain (excepting return tickets). On other lines again, they hold good for 3, 4, 6, or 14 days perhaps, allowing the holder to spend that number of days on his journey if he wishes, to visit other towns on his route. Tickets should be held conveniently, as the conductor on the train may wish to see them after every stopping-place, when he walks through the train to collect tickets for the next station, check others, and supply those who have none. Passengers may enter a car without having tickets, but if they do so, they in general have to pay a percentage of so much more by purchasing tickets from the conductor, in stead of at the booking-office at the railroad depot. In \" booking through\" long distances, you do not get one ticket only, as in Britain, to your destination, but you are furnished with several tickets; one for every company's line you travel over, so that in some cases you may have 8 or 10 tickets given you, if going a long distance \u2014 the number of tickets depending upon the number of different lines you pass over. On some lines the conductor, after he takes your ticket, gives you a check, which you are requested to place in the band of your hat or cap, so that in passing through he may see at a glance who have tickets and who have not. A large proportion of tickets, more particularly \" through tickets,\" per railroad, are purchased at ticket-offices apart from the railroad depots, in each city. Each line of road has a ticket-agency office in all the large cities, for the purpose of booking the \" through passengers\" by its particular route. No saving whatever is effected by purchas ing tickets at such offices, whilst there are so many competing lines of road to particular points, and so many offices of a swindling character, that it is very difficult for strangers to know a legitimate, from a \" bogus\" or swindling office ; and also to know which is the quickest and shortest line of travel. We, therefore, advise all strangers to take out their tickets at the office of the railroad depot, and there book through to their destination if they think proper, after they have ascertained which is the most suituable line for them to go by. There is the heavy premium of 20 per cent, commission paid to ticket-agents on all passengers they book ; no wonder, therefore, at the great anxiety there is on the part of some agents for booking passengers through by particular lines. WORKING CLASSES IN AMERICA. One good feature in the working classes here, is, the self-respect they appear to have for the appearance of themselves and families. In workshops, generally, the men wear a 6ort of light overalls over their clothing, so that when work is over, they throw these off and appear on the streets more \"respectable\" in appearance than the mechanics of Great Britain do after work, many of whom may be seen going from their workshops to wards home, more in the character of sweeps than any thing else. In every workshop here, there are opportunities for washing, etc., after work is over, and in large establishments, it is no uncommon thing to find a placard stuck up, with \" Men's Wash Room\" upon it, to which the men repair after work and wash themselves, before going home. In the evenings and on Sundays, the working classes walk about a great deal, with their wives and children, excepting during the hottest part of the day, in summer. Instead of either husband or wife carrying a child in arms, they have a light carriage or perambu lator, (with a hood over it, set upon two large wheels, and a rest from the handle so that il can stand on a level,) which the husband wheels along with the child in it, (sometimes two,) with no great trouble to any one. Such appears a more sensible plan, than either"], [430, "WORKMEN FROM BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2014 CLOTHING. 44 of the parents being burdened by carrying a child in arms, perhaps for a mile or two, often taking away all the pleasure attending a walk. The well-dressed appearance of .the working classes, on Sunday particularly, is apparent at once to a stranger from Great Britain, and, in most of the cities, one fails to see that crowd of ragged unwashed men and women which are to be found about the lazy corners of London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and such cities. Where such are seen about cities such as New York, you may be pretty certain they are Irish, who have not been long enough in the country to learn such habits of self-respect, or others who have given way to the influence of that mighty demon \u2014 drink. The Irish, when sober and industrious, very soon pick up the better habits of this country, and appear as tidy and clean-looking as any other class. This will be most apparent in the great numbers of Irish girls who are employed as servants in hotels and private families, when they turn out on Sunday, forming a great contrast to what would likely have been their position and appearance had they remained in \" Ould Ireland.\" In this country, the Irish and Germans are largely employed at the heavier descriptions of work, and form the \" hewers of wood and drawers of water\" for the rest of the popu lation. ' At the same time, in such cities as Cincinnati, and many places in the west, the Germans occupy, as a class, some of the very highest positions amongst the manufacturing, commercial, and agricultural classes, and wherever you go, you will hear only one opinion as to their general good conduct as citizens, being very steady, industrious, and prudent, and although proverbially fond of drinking \" lager beer,\" (a sort of home-brewed beer,) they maintain their character for being a sober people as well. In workshops generally, we have found that Scotch workmen, where steady, stand as high as any. If they have any fault, it is almost certain to be that of unsteadiness, arising from drink. Many first-class workmen there are who have lost good situations here, as well as elsewhere, from this one cause and curse. From all we have seen and heard, we have no hesitation in saying, that a good Scotch workman at almost any branch of trade, is certain to get on well in this country, if he is sober, and there be a sufficient in ducement for him to emigrate. In the first place, the Americans like the Scotch, as a people, in preference to either English, Irish, or Germans. Why it is so, we cannot tell, but nevertheless we have found it so throughout all the districts we have visited. Amongst the working classes, we find they earn good wages, and are esteemed by their em ployers, more particularly in iron foundries, machine shops, printing offices, etc., etc. In counting-houses and stores, young men from Scotland, particularly if they have been some time in England as well, fill good and responsible situations, and where not of the \" fast\" sort, are esteemed by their employers. After an intelligent and \" well posted up\" Scotchman has been in this country for some time, he is said to be a match for the sharpest Yankee. English workmen and assistants generally, are equally esteemed, and get on equally well, provided they have not too much \" bounce,\" self-conceit, and John Bull-ism about them. If Brother Jonathan has a good deal of boasting in his composition, (and many no doubt have,) employers do not like to see it, exhibited in strangers to an inordinate de gree. Employers have told us they could do no good with some English workmen, simply because they were so conceited as to what they knew, and what they thought was for the best, forgetting all the time, that work which might suit for England very well, will not, perhaps, do in America. Justin the same way as Scotch workmen, when they go to England, have to learn to do some kinds of work very differently, and, perhaps, in some cases more carefully than they have been accustomed to do in Scotland. All British and Irish workmen who come here, are advised to leave the habits connected with the pint or quart measure, the gill and the mutchkin, behind them, as nothing will sooner lead a man to dishonour and disgrace than the use of them here."], [431, "CLOTHING AND ARTICLES OF DRESS. 45 CLOTHING AND ARTICLES OF DRESS. A few words regarding the clothing worn in Canada and the United States may prove useful, if not interesting, to intending emigrants and tourists. We will refer first to the spring and summer clothing. Gentlemen's Wear, \u2014 In summer, gentlemen dress as light as they possibly can \u2014 light in color, and light in texture \u2014 from boots upwards. Light straw or woollen felt hats are worn ; the latter preferred. Although dearer at first, they are the cheapest in the end. Coats are made of cotton duck, linen drill, or unbleached grass-cloth, to fit loose and easy \u2014 some white, some drab, some greenish drab, and some unbleached. Some are ako made of light, thin tweeds. Vests \u2014 when worn at all \u2014 (which is frequently not the case in hot weather) are of plain or fancy quilting. Trowsers, or \" pants\" as they are called \u2014 same material as coat ; but often fine, thin tweeds of Scotch, German, French, or best English, a3 well as American, make. Although cool linen drills are preferred by some, thin woollens are fully the most service able and agreeable in travelling, as will be found out ; but they must be thin, and light in color. Immense quantities of small shepherd's checks are worn \u2014 all woollen, and all cot ton. Boots or shoes of the lightest dancing-school make \u2014 giving the idea to a stranger that the Americans are very extravagant in wearing patent leather boots at all times. They are the most comfortable \u2014 unless it be light boots made of canvas, merino cloth, or prunella. Any thing for ease and lightness. Collars are very much worn a la Byron, with a small ribbon round the neck, which, in hot weather, will be found quite heavy nough, if you wish to keep as cool and comfortable as possible. Braces are very little worn, the \" pants\" being made to fit without The dress of a gentleman is, generally speaking, very well made, fits neatly, and with great er economy in cloth than is observable in the clothing of Great Britain. Gentlemen in banks and counting-houses will be seen oftener without, than with, coats on at all. They write and transact business \" in their shirt sleeves\" \u2014 with perhaps a cigar or a quid in their mouth. For full dress \u2014 blue coat, velvet collar, and brass buttons, with black or white vest, and black superfine cloth trowsers, with black hat. The working classes, as we have said elsewhere, when at work, have overalls on \u2014 some times from neck to feet \u2014 to keep their clothing clean. When work is over, they throw the overalls off, and go to and from work with clothing such as is not seen worn in Great Britain by the great majority of the working classes on week days. Ladies' Wear. \u2014 We fear we must be more general in our remarks as to the ladies' \"dress materials.\" Suffice, therefore, to say, that they appear to be able to get nothing too thin and light for wear\u2014 whether it is a \" duck\" of a bonnet, a \" love\" of a dress, or a handsome boot \u2014 made of some light-coloured, thin material. In morning dress, pink \" wrappers\" \u2014 and where they can turn out, and not afraid of what \" Mrs. Grundy\" will say \u2014 they wear large gingham bonnets, called hoods, or sun-bonnets, with immense capes to them, spreading over the shoulders, and in front hiding nearly the face from sight\u2014 with the view of keeping off the sun\u2014 and for that purpose they appear very common-sense looking articles. In most cities, ladies may be seen walking, during the day, with bare arms underneath beautifully thin mantillas of lace, etc., and in the evenings, walking to and from theatres and concerts, without bonnets\u2014 all for the purpose of beiDg as cool as possible. All classes of females dress, when out walking, similarly to what they do in Great Brit ain, only, there are more thin materials and light colours worn from necessity, and the most expensive fabrics they can possibly procure. The fan is almost as universal an accompaniment with a lady as a parasol, and even many gentlemen may be seen walking along the streets with a palm-leaf fan in their hand, fanning away at themselves as they proceed\u2014 others with umbrellas up, to keep the rays of the sun off."], [432, "< 46 COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS \u2014 THE RETAIL STORF- KEEPER. Children are dressed in similar materials to grown up people. Thousands of little boys, of most respectable parentage, go to school with little else on than shirt and trowsers\u2014 leaving\" them free use of their limbs to run about, and with as much coolness as possible. With clean shirt, collar turned down, eleaD face, and hair in nice order, they look neat, clean and comfortable. The foregoing remarks apply to summer weather only. With the approach of autumn, care is necessary in wearing sometimes heavier clothing \u2014 as what may suit during the heat of the day, will not suit very early in the morning, or in the evening, after sundown. Not attending to this precaution, many get colds, and sow the germs of disease. As autumn creeps on, the dress of all assimilates to that of Great Britain, with the use of heavier materials, until old Boreas makes his appearance \u2014 freezing up rivers and lakes, and coming in his cold severity, the very thickest and warmest clothing is then in requisi tion \u2014 with coats for walking, sleighing, etc. Cloth cloaks and furs are very much worn by all females who can afford to buy them ; and, in fact, every one feels the same necessity for the warmest materials they can get for wearing in winter, as there was for providing for the hot weather, with every thing as thin and light as possible. Parties coming to this country for the first time, therefore, should study what clothing is beBt adapted for the season on arrival, and provide accordingly. COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS. Notwithstanding the immense amount of trade turned over, in America, by wholesale dry goods, (drapery,) grocery, hardware, and other mercantile houses, one sees, almost, nothing of that representative of commerce, of which the British commercial traveller is the type, with his baggage and patterns weighing from 50 lbs. to nearly half a ton weight, as are met with in such hosts, at the leading stations in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and in the streets in the country towns \u2014 where they follow each other in the retailer's stores \u2014 in quick succession. Their number in Great Britain and Ireland is upwards of thirty thousand, who are constantly \" on the road,\" every one of whom \u2014 with salaries and expenses running on \u2014 are expected to do something more than merely pay expenses. Such a thing as a dry goods house, like some in Manchester, or London, \u2014 who have 12 to 15 travellers constantly out, \u2014 is a thing unknown in America. Busi ness is transacted totally diffe-ent here, and there is not that perpetual hunting up of customers by personal solicitation that there is in Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 hence retail men here are not so apt to be, as they are not, so self-important in their ideas, as many re tail shop-keepers in Britain become, when they are waited upon so specially by some of the smartest\u2014 and most gentlemanly hard-working men \u2014 which the United Kingdom can boast of. In America, on account of the distances many store-keepers are from market, and owing to the seasons of the year, there are only two great periods for purchasing sup plies \u2014 something like what was the case 20 to 30 years ago, when retail shop-keepers in Britain laid in stocks twice a year only \u2014 instead of twice a week, as many of them do now. RETAIL STORE-KEEPERS. The great trade seasons, are \" Fall,\" or autumn, and Spring. The country store-keeper then prepares his list at home, which frequently consists of everything \u2014 from revolvers and pin-cushions, to crockery, moire antiques, and molasses. He then starts off on a journey varying from 100 to 3,000 miles for such places as New York, Philadelphia, or Montreal where he selects his 4 or 6 months supply. If he is buying on time, or wants a small assorted stock of each article, he goes the round of houses where he has a credit ac count If he has got cash in his pocket, and can buy largely, and is well up in his busi ness, he attends, perhaps, the auction sale rooms, (see article on Auctions, etc.,) and there bids for and buys what he likes, on the 6ame terms as the best house in New York,"], [433, "PUSHING TRADE \u2014 RETAIL SALESMEN. 47 and as he is probably not over particular a3 to the very latest noveltieB in fashion, he may buy goods, intrinsically lower in price than they were ever made for. One of the leading \" cards\" of the storekeeper\u2014 all over\u2014 is, \" Goods, cheap from auc tion,\" or, \" Goods at auction prices.\" These he transfers into dollars and cents as soon as he can, or what is as likely in many places, into pork, flour, or wheat, which three articlcc are excellent substitutes, and are looked upon as better than some bank bills. These arti cles of produce he can always get market-price for at the next leading market, to which he ships them for cash. The storekeeper, therefore, in America, has to be \" posted up\" in markets and values of articles which his British prototype has little idea of. However, in either case, it is but a matter of exchange after all, whether it be dry goods or groceries, for a gold piece or two, or for bacon or wheat, only, that the American storekeeper has two chances for profit, by having a profit in selling his dry goods and his produce also, which he is quite wide awake enough to sell to the best advantage. Of course this ap plies exclusively to country towns in the United States and Canada. In that way large quantities of agricultural produce, dry goods and other articles of domestic consumption are sold, and not a copper of money passes in the transactions. To a stranger, some of the enticing signs up in this trade are peculiar, and different from those in Great Britain. Instead of seeing, as in the leading streets of London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh or Dublin, placards of MESSRS. BUNKUM & CO'S. STOCK, Value \u00a350,000, BOUGHT 33$ PER CENT. UNDER COST PRICE, AND MUST BE CLEARED OUT.\" Or some \" Tremendous Failure,\" or \" Excruciating Sacrifice,\" on account of somebody or other becoming seized with the hard-up fever, and with the tempting window decoy-ducks of a St. Paul's Churchyard or Holborn, and that, too, with the very accommodating terms of \u2014 \"NO REASONABLE OFFER WILL BE REFUSED.\" Instead of these, the cash-box of America is filled upon the interesting information of \u2014 \" GLORIOUS NEWS, JOHN AND JONATHAN JOINED TOGETHER.\" Or, perhaps, an 8-feet high representation of the Goddess of Liberty, holding a banner in her hand, streaming forth the gratifying intelligence \u2014 \" NO MORE HARD TIMES,\" \" GOODS TO SUIT THE TIMES,\" \" Goods from Auction Cheaper than Ever,\" and, at least, one thousand other such cheering signs, all to assist to turn the dollar to the best advantage. We must, however, in justice, give the palm to some of those truly alarm ing announcements which now and then shake the nerves almost, of quiet-going people in the large cities of Great Britain, whilst they have the effect of making the sovereigns speedily chink out of ladies' pockets into the cash-drawers of those who know how to take the public by the ears and lead them along. As yet, also, we have failed to discover in America that organised band of retail drapery goods robbers, such as the \" Towzery Gang\" of England, where ladies \u2014 once caught in their trap, are bullied or threatened with some thing approaching to \" physical force,\" if they do not purchase some superb specimen of Norwich manufacture, at \u00a312 12s., worth at least \u00a360, (according to their value,) although according to the Manchester school from whence it sprung, was not worth 60s. even when fashionable 6 years before. There is one feature, however, in the retail trade here, which is carried on to a consider able extent sometimes, and that is, when two dealers commence to \" run\" against each other with an article, that is. to sell any particularly well-known description of goods at a mere shaving of profit \u2014 in competition with each other \u2014 so that purchasers"], [434, "RETAIL SALESMEN \u2014 APPLYING FOR A SITUATION. 48 may be attracted by the comparative cheapness of the two dealers' goods. We have heard that nothing delights the dealers better than to carry on a good run for some time, as in so doing they make \" a noise in the trade,\" and whilst selling one particular article at cost, perhaps, take good care to make up the profit on other articles they sell at the same time. Tbe \" running\" system extends to all classes of goods\u2014 to a cargo of soap, or sugar, or cotton cloth. It makes no difference what it is, so that they can \" raise the steam\" with it RETAIL SALESMEN. Probably some may wish to know how things are conducted behind the counter in America. As we have stated elsewhere, under the head of \" Commercial Assistants,\" what the necessary qualifications are for being \" up to the mark,\" we need not repeat here further than relate one anecdote we heard of, to show how the matter works some times when John Bull, in looking out for a situation, tries to \" come over\" Brother Jonathan, with \" any amount of experience.\" There were some vacancies in a retail store. John applied, with a large amount of politeness, and just as if applying at 9 o'clock in the morn ing at Swan and Edgar's (London), in going his rounds. Here, however, he was in a dif ferent atmosphere, where any superfluity of politeness becomes a bore, and a want of manly independence is at once detected. Entering the store, therefore, he finds the \" gov ernor\" (\" boss\" here) conning the morning paper, with cigar in his mouth, and Jiis feet on the window-sill. Instead of politely, and in as few words as possible, stating that he called to apply for one of the vacancies, he enters as lively as a cricket, with a heavy sail of canvas hoisted about his neck, and making two or three very profound bows, starts off with, \" Good morning, sir, I have taken the liberty to call \u2014 \" \" No liberty, sir,\" says Jonathan, interrupting. John: \"I beg pardon, sir.\" Jonathan: \" No occasion, sir.\" John by this time was becoming more polite than before, and with a half-smile on his countenance, muttered out, \" Vacancy, sir.\" Jonathan, by this time was aware of the fellow's want of manliness, and came out with, \" I guess it is a situation you want.\" John was quite relieved, and now began to muster up some pluck, and some of the \" cheek\" of the craft coming to his assistance, he came out boldly, \" Yes, sir, I have called to apply for one of the vacancies you have.\" Jonathan : \" Well, I guess so. Where have you lived ?\" John : \" My last situation, sir, was with Messrs. Sweater, Premium & Co., of the Borough.\" Jonathan never having heard of that \" location,\" or if he had, he had forgot, for he inquired : \" Where's that ?\" John, no doubt surprised at Jonathan's ignorance, replied : \" In London, sir, of course.\" Jonathan : \" Oh, I see. I guess your just from England ; you won't suit for what we want. We want men with experience.\" John now began to get rather more \" plucky\" than before, and from his own knowledge of his experience, fancied that he was slightly insulted, so he instantly ejaculated out, \" Experience, Bir, I have any amount of experience. Experience, sir ! why, sir, I have lived in five-and-thirty situations during the last 2 years. What more would you want, sir 1\" expressed with all the nonchalance possible, and at last felt himself as good a man as the one he was addressing. He had certainly shut him up, as Jonathan coolly replied, with the tail of his eye turned up from off his newspaper, \" Why, I calculate you have had too much experience for us,\" and with that, John bolted right out of the store, highly indig nant. In this ease there was a misunderstanding on the part of both ; on the part of Jona than, in not knowing but that the applicant had had experience in houses on this side of the Atlantic ; whereas, John supposed, that having lived in 35 situations in the course of 24 months in London, was such as to entitle him to say he had \" any amount of expe rience,\" but in bis ignorance, not knowing that the greater part of such experience would be of little or no avail here, more particularly as his changes had been rather numerous. The retail assistants in the drapery stores in the large cities are, of course, similar to those in England, only that in serving their customers, there is not so much of that subserviency"], [435, "RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS \u2014 WHOLESALE SALESMEN. 49 of manner, on the part of salesmen, nor of that thousand-mile-off hauteur and condescension, which some ladies in middle-class life attempt to exhibit on making, or trying to make, pur chases in drapery establishments in Britain. The American lady is, in general, free, frank, and chatty in style, at the same time the lady in all her remarks. She, in general, decides promptly, and neither bores the salesmen to produce an endless variety of an article of dress \u2014 which only puzzles her the more. In genera), they are easily served, and as pl\u00ab \u2022- ant to serve as real ladies are in such as Howell & James' (London). Of course there are cases where some ladies delight to \" go a shopping\" without any intention of purchasing, and who are quite regardless of the trouble they give. These, however, are the exceptions. From the difference of manners on the part of all parties, the salesman is apt to be thought easy, independent, and even rude, if some lady newly arrived from Britain should enter a store, and look for all that extra quantity of bowing and sychophantishness of man ner, of which too much is to be seen in shops and warehouses all over Great Britain. Here there is perfect civility, with a proper degree of business independence, and with some what of the feeling, that the obligation between buyer and seller is mutual. Consequently, there are not so many great and earnest thanks expressed for the exchange of a ball of cot ton, or two oz. of tea, for the price of the same, as one is accustomed to hear in retail houses in all parts of Britain. Retail assistants are not compelled to appear behind the retail dry-goods counters of America, like so many hotel-waiters, in full dress, or parsons, in black cloth suits and white \"chokers,\" or in the \"mourning department,\" where the assistant is expected to modify his usual business-like manner into one of affected gravity, and modulate his tone into a whine, according to the depth of mourning the bonnet-ribbon is for. The retail draper's assistant here, as yet, seems to be left that amount of independence for him to dress either in a black coat or a brown one, a pair of black \" pants\" or a pair of shepherd's checks, if he thinks proper; and employers neither enforce the flunkeyism alluded to, nor compel that Regent-street style of double-faced cant and hypocrisy in the selling of a half mourn ing, or even a full mourning, dress-piece, or pair of gloves. In these respects, the atmos phere of drapery life here is purer, more wholesome, and men are free to breathe in it \u2014 even behind the counter \u2014 and not quite so afraid of being desired \" to walk into the counting-house, and make out your account\" by a shop-walking, petty tyrant, or employer, simply because you happened to let fall a package of hosiery on the counter with a little dust on it, before a customer, whilst descending a high ladder with an armful of such. To the credit of American employers be it said, from all we have seen and heard, they have some rational ideas of what human perfection amounts to, and in their conduct in such a miserably small matter as that alluded to \u2014 if they noticed it at all \u2014 they recollect, that, \" to err is human \u2014 to forgive, divine,\" far less the idea of turning a young man out of his situa tion for so paltry a mishap. Drapery readers in London\u2014 as well as further north \u2014 will know whether we are overstating the matter in the slightest degree in thus noticing the in tolerable tyranny there is exercised behind some retail counters in the United Kingdom. WHOLESALE SALESMEN. The assistant in a wholesale store is a still more independent being than the retail sales man. You will find him often serving a customer, smoking a cigar, and going about the matter very easy and cool. We have no doubt he knows his man, and treats him accord ingly. The motions of some of these \" far west\" storekeepers, are something like the Scotch and Irish buyers in Britain \u2014 never in any great hurry in deciding, and pretty much given to \" look round\" before they begin any where, although a few \" plums\" are thrown in their path to make them bite, if they will nibble at all. Probably, the very customer we now allude to with the salesman smoking his cigar, and seated on a pile of goods, or on the top of a box alongside \u2014 is one who had once been accustomed to buy his goods in Glasgow, Dublin, or Belfast, or the son of such a man, and who requires some little patience exercised if a \" parcel\" is to be made out of him. Under these circumstances, therefore, Jonathan is"], [436, "50 BOARDING OF WHOLESALE AND RETAIL ASSISTANTS. a match for him. He is the personification of Job himself \u2014 barring the cigar, we suppose \u2014 and so long as there is a dollar to be made by waiting, he will rest himself, and wait, with the occasional expression of a \"guess\" or \" calculate.\" It must not, however, be supposed that this phase of wholesale dry goods salesmanship is to be taken as a criterion of the wholesale man generally. In general, it is just the very reverse. As we have stated elsewhere, the services of a dry goods' salesman rests between selling a man a bale of goods, making an entry in a day-book or invoice, drawing a bill, or nailing np a box He is neither too ignorant for the one, nor too proud for the other. In importing houses, where cases of goods are sold by patterns on cards, the matter is a very simple one, as only the patterns arc seen \u2014 aud they speak for the case ; nor is there that diversity of work as we have mentioned in wholesale stores, as a regular thing, for one man to perform, but the salesmen employed there are able to do one and all if necessity requires it, and hence the great difference between a salesman in a store in America from one in Britain. In the one case, he can be either book-keeper, salesman, or traveller, knowing about all sorts of goods. In the other, too frequently, he knows nothing but the silks, fus tians, or ribbons of his department; and as for drawing a bill, and adding interest, it is a matter quite foreign to his commercial education or experience. In the every-day life of the wholesale and retail assistants in America, there is the great and incalculable blessiDg they enjoy, compared to thousands of their brethren in England, of being at liberty to go home after business hours, and enjoy themselves in the society of friends or relations, instead of being made the victims of that body and mind destroying system of boarding on the premises \u2014 in vogue in many of the large houses in London \u2014 where young men, after being confined all day behind a counter, with half an hour to din ner, and a quarter of an hour to tea, on the premises \u2014 where the late hours of business pre vent them, in many cases, getting outside of the door for days together \u2014 where, night after night, they march from the counter to their bedroom, where the barrack-system is in force, with 12 to 18 sleeping in one poisonous atmosphere, and, in some eases, none of the cleanest bedrooms, and rising to the universal plain breakfast of tea and bread and butter, a din ner of scandalous meat, provided by contract \u2014 with again tea and bread and butter for their 15 minutes' tea. Such an existence as that is unknown in America, and long may it remain so. No employers here can as yet be charged with shattering the constitu tions of their assistants, and sending them to premature graves \u2014 a charge which it is well known rests at the doors of some of London's largest and proudest houses, in cases of bygone as well as present delinquencies. Cases of young men falling asleep on their legs and being glad to make their bed under the counter sometimes, rather than go to their bedrooms, are unknown here. We have no desire to go into details. We have given the shadow only of realities, which have existed and do exist yet. To the honour of some houses in Manchester, more particularly, has the position of the wholesale drapery assistant been improved by shorter hours of business, and in some of the London houses improve ments in other respects have been adopted, aud not before they were wanted, although there is vet much room for improvement in quarters where the public en masse little dream of. It is only iu newly opened-up districts in America where the retail assistant boards in the family of the employer, and there he is received and treated as one of the family. There is no such a thing as boarding young men on the wholesale garrison Bystem of Lon don houses. Assistants here go to business after breakfast, at from 7 to 9 o'clock, dine where they like, and the wholesale stores close at 5 or 6, p. M \u2014 in the winter time earlier. Retail houses keep open to 7, p. m., although some of them shut at 6, p. m. We have been alluding to the large cities in the States. In Canada, (Montreal for example,) we have seen the retail stores keeping open till 9 and 10, p. m. They generally, however, shut at 8, p. M. \" Wholesale life\" in Canada is much the same as in the States, and for weeks and months nearly, in winter, assistants have nothing to do but toast their toes at the great stoves, which heat up almost every sort of house. Although we have referred more particularly to the dry goods or drapery trade, we luive done so merely to illustrate the systems of the two countries. The same remarks"], [437, "51 MPLOYER AND EMPLOYED. apply to all fm des arid all departments of commercial life. Throughout America generally there is a cordiality and harmony of feeling between employer and employed, and an independence on the part of assistants, unknown almost in Great Britain and Ireland, and we have no doubt, where such feelings exist, they have their effect in making the wheels of a concern run more smoothly along, keep up its pace better with its rivals, and avoid all the \"snags\" and pitfalls on its course, than when the \"ribbons\" are pulled and jerked about too much, and when the whip is applied to those who require none, by those who act so, in attempting to drive their business along to :i profitable issue. Every encouragement is given to young men of talent, and nowhere is a man of ster ling ability sooner appreciated, and nowhere is he better paid, than in the commercial es tablishments of the United States."], [438, "52 SQUATTING ON LAND, AND PRE-EMPTION. LAND AND AGRICULTURE. In this department of our work, we purpose including, asmuch as possible, what relates to the agriculture of the country \u2014 its produce, prices, etc., together with such information as we have gathered from a variety of sources, in different districts, both in the United States and Canada \u2014 so as to present, to all interested in such matters, as general an idea as possible, of a large portion of the whole country, particularly of those districts to which intending settlers and others are now directing their attention. To some readers, probably, our observations may be already well-known, but we believe that, for a large class of readers, the information given may be interesting, and the sugges tions thrown out \u2014 as the result of our observations, and what we have heard from reliable parties \u2014 may prove of some practical use. We will take up, first of all, then, the position of primeval farming, so to speak, or squatting on land, and that of pre-emption. SQUATTING ON LAND, AND PRE-EMPTION. SQUATTING SCENE IN KANSAS, ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSOURI. .. rrhe.,r\u00b0odbcut above represents the squatter on a \"location\" in Kansas Territory, after he has cot ud his shanty and an acre or two of land cleared, ready for cultivation. As explained elsewhere, the house now in view will, by and by, give place to one of larger dimensions, and more complete and comfortable in other 1 CSpCvCltii J For the information of those readers who do not exactly understand the nature of occu pying the land, by squatting upon it, and acquiring the pre-emptive right to purchase, we will as far as possible explain it."], [439, "NECESSARY FORMS ON PRE-EMPTING. 53 Squatting upon land, is occupying land without any legal title to it, or without asking any one's consent to do so. This applies to government lands, which are wild, or which have never been bronght under cultivation, or lands which have not been sold by them. For example, if you go out to a new territory, say Kansas, for instance, you may there select 160 acres of unoccupied, or unsold land : you take possession of it, and \" squat,\" or live upon it. When the government wish to sell that land, along with other portions in the same neighbourhood, it is put up lo pubhc auction, at the \" Land Sales\" in that neighbourhood. You, having \" squatted\" upon it, or taken possession of it, have the \" pre-emptive\" right of buying it at the govern ment price of $1.25 (or os. stg.) per acre. Hence, the word \" Pre-emption.\" Regarding the precise terms of pre-empting, we give the following law on the subject, as carried out in the Territory of Minnesota, which will give an idea of what it is, as ap plied generally, but with, probably, modifications in other States. From this it will be seen that a man, with some little capital, can go and select 160 acres of the best land he can find, in a new territory, without costing him one farthing of rent for probably a number of years, and when he does come to pay for it, he buys the whole 160 acres, and all upon it, for $200, or \u00a340 stg. Pre-emption Law. \u2014 The following embrace the points which persons wishing to make pre emptions in Minnesota, are required to prove to the satisfaction of the officers at the different Land Offices, in order to pre-empt: 1. The settler must never before have had the benefit of pre-emption under the act. 2. He must not, at the time of making the pre-emption, be the owner of 320 acres of land in any State or Territory in the United Stales. 8. He must settle upon and improve the land in good faith, for his own exclusive use or ben efit, and not with the intention ot selling it on speculation; and must not make, directly or indi rectly, any contract or agreement in any way or manner, with auy person or persons, by which the title which he may acquire from the United States should enure, in whole or in part, to the benefit of any person except himself. 4. He must be twenty-one years of age, and a citizen of the United States ; or if a foreiguer, must have declared his intention to become a citizen, before the proper authority, and received a certificate to that effect. 5. He must build a house on the laud, live in it, and make it his exclusive home, and must be an inhabitant of the same at the time of making application for pre-emption. [Until lately, a single man might board with his nearest neighbour ; but the same is now required of a single as of a married man, except that, if married, the family of the settler must also live in the house.] 6. The law requires that more or less improvement be made on the land, such as breaking, fencing, etc. ; but pre-emptions are granted where a half acre is broken and euclosed. 7. It is necessary that no other person entitled to the right of pre-emption, resides on the land at the same time. 8. No one is permitted to remove from his own land, and make a pre-emption in the same State or Territory. 9. The settler is required to bring with him to the Land Office, a written or printed applica tion, setting forth the facts in his case of the 1st, 2d and 3d requirements here mentioned, with a certificate appended, to be signed by the Register and Receiver, and make affidavit to the same. 10. He is always required to bring with him a respectable witness of his acquaintance, who is known to the (act of his settlement, to make affidavit to the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and Sth require ments here mentioned, with the same set forth on paper, with a corresponding blank certificate attached, to be signed by the land officers. 11. The pre-emptor, if a foreigner, must bring with him to the Land Office, duplicates of his naturalization papers, duly signed by the official from whom they were received. A minor, who is a hea'd of a family, or a widow, may also pre-empt\u2014 their families being required to live on the land. The settler is required to file a written declaratory statement of his intention to pre-empt before he can proceed with his pre-emption. Fees.\u2014 1st. The fee required by the Register, for filing a declaratory statement, is $1. 2d. For granting a pre-emption, the Register and Receiver can receive each 50 cents. 3d.

We next proceed to explain what is meant by farms \" cleared,\" and \" uncleared.\" FARMS, CLEARED AND UNCLEARED. A farm \" cleared,\" is one, from off which all the lumber (or timber) has been cut or cleared away, or a farm, on a prairie, on which there never had been any timber, which is called sometimes a cleared, and sometimes a prairie, farm. The great majority of the farms in the western States are prairie farms, on some of which there is not a vestige of timber growing, and on others where there may be part timber land and part prairie land. In a good healthy locality, such a farm, as the last mentioned, is most valuable ; as, in that ease, there is no lumber or timber to purchase, to fence a farm with, as well as for"], [441, "FARMING IN THE BUSH. 55 fuel ; whereas, in some prairie districts, where there is no timber, that i6 a heavy neces sary item of expenditure. On prairie lands, partly timbered, you can commence opera tions at once, without clearing, and have sufficient wood for fuel and fencing purposes. An \"uncleared\" farm, is a farm composed of forest In reality, it cannot properly be called a farm, till some portion of it is cleared and converted into a farm. But, although densely covered with sorest, it is nevertheless called an uncleared farm. The farms in Canada \u2014 which exist in a primeval state \u2014 are nearly all uncleared, called \" forest lands\" by some, and \" wild lands\" by others. Many districts of the United States are of a similar character. \" Partially cleared\" farms are those, of course, on which part of the timber is cut down and cleared away, although it does not always follow that such partially cleared lands are cultivated. Having now given, we hope, some idea of what is meant by farms being cleared, un cleared, or partially cleared, we will now proceed to consider the subject of entering upon a farm uncleared, or, as it is called, \" farming in the bush.\" FARMING IN THE BUSH, In considering the inducements which the States, or Canadas, present to emigrants, we think the bright side of the picture has been far too often presented, and looked at, with out parties having a proper conception of either the nature of the country, the difficulties to be overcome, and the hardships to be put up with for some time \u2014 thereby leading many in Europe to leave good situations, or comfortable homes, for a life which they were totally unfitted for. Supposing that you are of the agricultural class, and think of coming to try and secure a home in Canada, or any wooded district in the States, we would remind you that such is not to be secured without encountering great labour, self-sacrifice, and even privation \u2014 it may be for a time. You may have been in the habit, of fancying that you have nothing to do but emigrate \u2014 buy a piece of land, say 50 to 150 acres \u2014 pay a deposit upon it \u2014 and that you are all right for life, or that you have nothing to do but sow, reap, convert your produce into money, and make rich in a few years, and during that interim, even, that you arc to lead a romantic sort of life in the woods, with game and fish so abundant, that you have no occasion to work very hard. If such has been your idea of a \"life in the bush,\" or the backwoods, it is high time that you understood the truth, which is somewhat differ ent from any such picture. There is not a greater mistake can be made, than to have incorrect notions of what a life in the bush is, more particularly if you happen to buy a farm \" heavily\" or \" well timbered\" \u2014 words which may fall very sweetly upon the ears of some, who have little or no idea what is meant \u2014 little fancying, perhaps, that a \" well-timbered\" farm is just a dense forest ; and when \" heavily timbered,\" the trees are all the larger, and more difficult to chop down, or clear. A farm, therefore, in the \" bush,\" \" well-timbered\" or \" uncleared,\" is just as we have said, a dense forest, without a yard of ground upon which you can grow a few pota toes, until you have cleared it of some of its trees. On entering, therefore, upon an uncleared farm, you must be prepared not only to work hard yourself, but all your family (if you have any) will have to do the same. By bo doing, you will save paying out money for assistance. We will suppose you have arrived at your \" lot.\" You find no house upon it. The first thing, therefore, is for you to find out your nearest neighbours, let them know you are come to settle beside them, and you want some help to put up your \" shanty.\" This they will willingly do\u2014 in 4 or 6 days, depending upon the number employed \u2014 being always very \"lad to hear of new neighbours settling near them. They erect your house, there fore, and, so far, you have made a start. Presuming that you have got all your baggage, etc., brought up to your house and put aside, you are now about ready to commence opera tions. There you are, with your 100 acres, perhaps, with the dreary solitude of a forest on"], [442, "56 FARMING IN THE BUSH. every side of you, which you have to clear away, or part of it, and level the now big \"monarchs of the forest\" with the ground; drag them to a road or riverside; sell them, if you can find a purchaser; make fences all round your lot with portion of the trees you have chopped down, and erect a barn for your cattle, etc. All the implements you require for the first 12 months is an axe and a hoe, and, supposing you have procured these, then your first step may be said to have commenced in the formation of your future farm and home, aud in the production, by-and-by, of many of the comforts of life. It is in the first periods of your hard and laborious work \u2014 all alone, perhaps \u2014 that all your philosophy, courage, together with indomitable perseverance, is necessary, to support you in your exer- tions to accomplish your object. It is then when your heart may begin to fail, if ever it does so at all. It is then that many, like yourself, have come out to this country with very erroneous ideas as to what, \"farming in the bush\" meant, and it is then that they throw down the axe in disgust, disheartened, and repenting the day they ever set foot on this soil, perhaps; or, at all events, that they bought a farm. The consequence is, they give up their undertaking. They have an instalment of the purchase-money coming due on the property \u2014 it must be paid \u2014 and as they have no money to spare, the result is, that they must either find a purchaser for their farm, who will give them part in cash, or else the sheriff will step in and sell it to the highest bidder, or the party they bought it from comes and claims possession. Such people had, perhaps, found out, that they had made a mistake in attempting to clear a farm without the requisite perseverance or skill to do it; or it may be, that they had not calculated sufficiently all the cost of travelling and other expenses necessary to enable them to live and clear it properly. Supposing that you are in their circumstances, that you are short of funds, and are at a stand-still, all you have to do is, to hire yourself out, and such of your family as can work, to some of the neighbouring settlers, who will be glad of your assistance, and who will pay you as much as will keep you and your family comfortable, and enable you to save something besides. By this means, therefore, you will, by-and-by, have money to pay your instalment, or interest, pur- chase necessaries for your own farm, and then be independent of your neighbours' assistance and hiring yourself out, and go on more smoothly and better than before. In addition to the hard work referred to, of chopping trees, piling all the brush-wood together and burning it, and other necessary work, you may feel yourself solitary, away from the society of friends, etc., and you begin to weary. All such feelings, however, must at once be cheeked, if you wish to do any good. You will make new acquaintances where you are, with your neighbouring settlers, and what with the labours of the day \u2014 \" the blazing ingle and the clean fireside\" \u2014 a good housewife to cheer you up, the recol lection that you are then only laying the foundation of future comfort, and that there is no great achievement to be accomplished without, hard work, you lift the axe once more, and go more merrily to work, forgetting the pleasures, as well as the miseries also, that you per haps left on the other side of the Atlantic. If you happen to belong to the manufacturing or any other class of emigrants \u2014 not agri cultural\u2014you will find the life of a farmer, on an uncleared farm, all the more arduous, as you have probably never lifted an axe in your life before, and your strength is not so great as the hardy agriculturist, who will find it comparatively much easier. No matter however poor the agricultural labourer may be, if he can only get engaged upon a farm as an assistant, he will, er\" long, have the chance of having a farm of his own. No matter how small the means of a farmer, and how large his family may be, if he can only once get settled down upon a piece of land of his own, and have sufficient provisions. or money to buy them with, till he raises his own, he will, ere long, be independent, in a manner, for life; whilst the man of capital, by settling even upon an uncleared farm can, by engaging assistance, soon have his farm cleared and crops in the ground. To such a man, of course, the thing is comparatively easy, and with an excellent prospect of a good investment, (provided he has bought good land,) not only on the land he has bought, but in taking advantage of many cheap lots which he may buy in the neighbourhood, to sell again to new settlers, more particularly as partially cultivated farms."], [443, "THE BUSH\u2014 CLEARING THE LAND\u2014 RAISING A SHANTY. 57 It is well known that men, who knew nothing at all about farming in Great Britain are now excellent farmers, in America, as well is it known, that even weavers-not a very likely class of emigrants for becoming farmers\u2014 sometimes do well. (See \" Farming, not in the West\"; It greatly depends upon the man himself\u2014 what position he is in for living during the first 6 to 12 months-and if he has a wife who can help and cheer him in his first difficulties, instead of worrying his existence with whines and regrets-how he succeeds. If a family of boys and girls, able to assist at work, so much the better, so that, even with all the difficulties which operations in the woods present, you will find even amid these, if you have made a good selection, (much depends upon that,) yon will not be long before you are enjoying the most substantial comforts of life, in producing your own milk, butter, eggs, poultry, vegetables, fruit, and pork. If you expect to make a fortune at your uncleared farm, you will be disappointed, as fortunes are not to be made at Buch. All you can expect and obtain, will be a comfortable home, a good plain existence on your own property, and securing peace and independence in the enjoyment of life's greatest blessings\u2014 freedom from the cares of the future, for your self and family\u2014 freedom from the fear of want (that gaunt spectre which rises up now and then before so many of the toiling thousands)\u2014 having your children well educated \u2014bringing them up in one of the noblest professions (agriculture) \u2014 and away from the pestiferous vices of a life in a large city; altogether, we fancy, worth the while of the able and the willing to toil\u2014 even amid difficulties\u2014 for a few years. But to ob tain these, work you must, and that very hard, and under discouraging circumstances, for some time. In proceeding to any particular part of the country, you should find out the residence of the Government Land Agent \u2014 if near at hand \u2014 who will give you every advice as to how to proceed to any particular locality, and any information he is possessed of, as likely to be useful to you. As to when to emigrate, and all other particulars regarding farms, cleared and un cleared, we refer the reader to separate articles. LIFE IN THE BUSH. As illustrative of some of the features of a life in the backwoods, or upon an uncleared farm, not noticed elsewhere, as well as corroborative of our preceding remarks, we subjoin the following from a valued correspondent, residing on the banks of Lake Huron, Canada West, which we hope will prove interesting: \u2014 \" What is ' the Bush' ? ' Why, I suppose,' says the old countryman, ' it is a country overrun with thorn and thicket \u2014 bush and brake \u2014 whin and heather \u2014 brier, broom and bramble \u2014 all of which must be burnt up before the land can be brought under cultivation.' Ha! ha! These are all old country notions, indeed ! Take a forest, whose trees rear their lofty heads DO or 70 feet in height, and the girth of numbers of whose stalwart stems cannot be measured by the em brace of a man's arms. That's the primeval forest \u2014 'The Bush,' which originally covered the surface of the Canadian province. Run lines through it, as the government surveyor did, at right angles to each other, forming square blocks of several hundred acres, sub-divide them into lots of 100 acres each, and that's a Bush farm ; the title-deed of which, let us suppose, has been placed in the hands of a Scotch settler in Western Canada. \" Did you ever see a man commence to gather a grain crop by pulling it up stalk by stalk ? The very idea is ridiculous ; and yet the Canadian settler attempts a more herculean task with the assistance of the ' Yankee axe.' He fells tree after tree \u2014 strips them of their branches and leaves, and in tbe first place raises a 'shanty' \u2014 an extemporized erection rendered familiar to the eye by ' navvies' during the construction of railroads ; fixes a bedstead, of the same rough materials, in one end, and a fire-place in the other. Such is, generally, the primitive abode of the sturdy pioneer of civilization, the home of his thrifty wife and hardy family. Happy man, if he rejoices in the possession of two or three sons who can wield the axe iu slashing down those monsters of the forest that run riot in the fertility of the soil. When a clearance of 10 or 20 acres has been effected by the process of felling and stripping, the neighbouring farmers hold a ' logging-bee' for his benefit \u2014 pile up the logs in heaps, covered with the brushwood, with the"], [444, "58 THE WONDERFUL TREE IN THE BUSH. aid of oxen and hand-spikes, and conclude their day of industry with a brilliant bonfire and il lumination of the massive accumulations. Their blackened relics, however, still cumber the soil. Accordingly, they are collected together\u2014' branding' the process is styled\u2014 and at last con sumed to ashes. It is true, the blasted stumps, two or three feet in height, rooted immovably in terra firma, still disfigure the clearance, and will continue for 6 or 7 years to stand and rot, un less they are extracted by patent inventions and at considerable expense. But the settler now feels the gratification of beholding a field in the forest, the seed-corn planted in the virgin soil \u2014 like an oasis in the desert\u2014 and the sun beaming upon the prospect at least, of peace and plenty in a happy home in the new world. \" Don't imagine, however, that he can fold his hands in listless indolence in expectation of at taining independence, or of reaping an abundaut harvest on such easy terms. Fuel must be procured, of course, by felling the nearest tree, and daily chopping and splitting it into faggots. The well must be sunk, and water is, generally, found at no great depth ; patches of potatoes, turnips and Indian corn must be hoed ; and the barn and stable must be raised to house the coming crop as well as cattle. The Yankee axe rings again through the forest for many a long day ; and when some of the logs have been hewn, squared and morticed, and others have been drawn to the saw-mill, cut into lumber, (or boards,) and can ied home again, another \" Bee\" is summoned, another log barn and stable\u2014 plain oblong erections, covered with shingles\u2014 (wood split into the size and shape of slates,) are raised with a hearty shout of acclamation at their com pletion. \" Harvest comes at last, and winter, dreary and desolate, clothes the whole country with a thick winding sheet of snow ; but the gleam of the invaluable axe flashes from ' light to light' through the Bush ; block after block is chopped, logged, burnt \u2014 brought under cultivation j and only a single strip is left standing for farm purposes and fuel. \"The 'shanty' is superseded by the log-house \u2014 not without a 'Bee,' however \u2014 partitioned off into rooms, up stairs and down stairs ; the log-house yields, in course of time, to the ' frame house,' lathed, plastered, papered, and filled with elegant furniture ; and yet, commodious and comfortable even as it is, a brick or stone mansion, very generally, proves the permanent resi dence of the farmer enriched by a long course of assiduous industry. The orchard has, in the mean time, sprung up in the vicinity of the house, furnishing ample supplies of apples, pears, cherries, plums aud peaches ; the garden is stocked with cabbage, carrots, cucumbers, and cur rants, beets, onions, and French beans for family use. A team or two of horses, capable either of drawing the plough or driving in a wagon or buggy, stand in the stable ; and last, not least, several sons may have been settled on separate farms in the neighbourhood. And where, do you suppose, is the sugar obtained that sweetens their tea and flavours their preserves? ' At the store, of course,' says the old countryman. 'I never paid a penny for a pound of sugar since the first spring I came to Canada,' says the old settler, ' except for a big pot to prepare it. We walk into the Bush in spring \u2014 make an incision in the maple tree \u2014 collect the flowing sap in wooden troughs \u2014 boil it to proper consistency in the big pot, suspended, like a gipsy's, upon a cross-tree supported at each end, and pour it into moulds to undergo crystallization.' ' Do you know, then, where we purchase our vinegar?' 'At the store, to be sure.' 'No, sir. From the maple tree, also, during the process of sugar manufacture.' ' Well, then, can you guess where we procure our beer?' 'At the brewer's, I presume ; or stay \u2014 I have it this time! It is \" home-brewed\" from hop sand treacle.' ' From the maple, too, sir.' ' How are you off for soap? Soap, I guess, doesn't exude from your wonderful tree!' 'Not exactly, sir; but tbe ashes are manufactured into soap, with the addition of tallow procured from the cattle we kill for our table.' ' Sugar and vinegar ! soap and beer ! Prodigious ! as Dominie Sampson would have exclaimed ; such a heterogeneous combination of commodities extracted from a single ma ple tree ! Surely, these exhaust the catalogue of commodities provided by this invaluable deni zen of the Bush?' 'No, sir; when we have exhausted the supplies of sugar and vinegar, soap and beer, produced by the bounteous maple, we chop it into fuel.' \" The fact is, bating a few pounds of tea \u2014 green tea, moreover, annually \u2014 and probably a few yards of sundry silks and broadcloths for the male and female members of the family \u2014 for early settlers, at least, do not disdain to weave and wear the ' hodden grey ' \u2014 the Canadian farmer is surrounded with a general store, situated within the limits of the 100 acres of his own property. His wife and daughters perform the duties of bakers, cooks, and confectioners, in the domestic establishment, with the assistance of a stove, and an oven attached to it. Finer, spongier bread, and sweeter cake, you won't find in Edinburgh. Pork and ham must often supply the place of beef and mutton, especially during the hot months of summer. But a vegetable diet is demand ed at a temperature of 90\u00b0 in the shade ; and he must be tormented with a very fastidious palate"], [445, "GOOD LIVING AND HARD WORK \u2014 THE RESULT. 59 who cannot relish the lettuce, the cucumbers, tbe stewed apples, apple-tarts, and custards, not to mention a fresh fish now and then, and the milk, eggs, cakes, with melons, and pumpkins in their season, that crown the table of the Canadian farmer. \" Such a table betrays no symptoms of the 'hard times' complained of on every hand. Cer tainly not. ' The country has been drained of money,' ' Money's not to be had,' is the gener al lamentation. ' Notwithstanding, we have plenty to eat aud drink,' is the common appendix to the woful Jeremiad. \" ' When it rains, it pours,' is proverbial of Canadian life, as well as climate. Flash ! darts the lightning across the thunder clouds in summer, and down bursts a deluge that saturates the soil. Presto ! out glares the burning sun to bake the steaming surface into crust. The people strip to their shirts and pants, and suffer the perspiration to flow from every pore during the glow of their tropical summer, and muffle themselves, from top to toe, in fur caps, gauntlets and Buffalo robes during the biting cold of these polar countries. \" They swallow pailfuls of water during the intensity of the heat, and diarrh\u0153a carries them off, without warning, to their long home. They dart in swift cutters (sleighs) through a tempera ture of 20\u00b0 below zero, and Jack Frost nips their nose or bites off a finger or two. Let them but catch a chill, the cold will not only titillate them into a cough, but shake them, as does the ague, like the aspen that shivers with every passing breeze. Last year, spring burst and bud ded almost instantaneously into summer with a clear and cloudless sky, but autumn deluged and destroyed the fields of flowing grain. This year, winter would not yield to spring ; rain poured until June ; scarcely a drop fell in summer ; consequently the wheat, instead of present ing the plump appearance of a barn-door beauty, shrivelled and shrunk up like the features of 'auld grannie.' 'Hard times, sir! Notwithstanding, we have plenty to eat and drink.' Yes ; and luxuries and royal game, to boot, let us add. Why, the Canadian farmer has only to shoulder his gun\u2014 for every Canadian keeps a gun or rifle\u2014 and supply his table from the flocks of wild pigeons that literally darken the sun in spring furnishing a variety to pork and mutton from the coveys of partridges that breed in the Bush. Not only so, but a 'lordly dish' of veni son from the deer that still stray round the vicinity of recent settlements, and even from the wild ducks and wild geese which frequent the lakes, lakelets and rivers. \" Could we only recount the tales which are told by gray-haired patriarchs seated round old winter's blazing hearth, we might convey some idea of the hardships endured by the early set tlers in the province, and of the comparative ease with which a settlement can be effected in 1859. Well do I remember one of their number, declaring, in his own graphic style: 'Here am I, hashed and broken down with perpetual chopping and hard labour; my farm is cleared and fenced, but my sons will reap the reward.' ' There was not a store nearer than Hamil ton, 40 miles distant,' says another, ' and I was compelled to carry a bag of wheat and other provisions for my family on my back through the Bush \u2014 and you know what a bush-road is, especially in the fall \u2014 full of ' glaur' and cradle holes.' \" Nay, it was only the other day that a farmer told us that he started with his oxen and wagon to the store, only 20 miles distant, and could not return in less than 4 or 5 days ; but, of course, such difficulties are encountered only in some of the more recent settlements, where the roads have not been cut through the bush, and they are, therefore, compelled to wind round mud-holes and swamps, which have not been covered with ' corduroy,' on their tedious journey. The rapidity which the progress of civilization has made in the province, within tbe last few years, is almost incredible ; iu fact, penetrate the province at any point you choose, you will meet with settlers, stores and churches \u2014 ' kirk and market' \u2014 within a circle of no great dimen sions. And were it not that the government has drawn charmed lines round the ' Indian Re serves,' the red Indians would, undoubtedly, have been driven to herd with the hears and wolves which prowl round the outskirts of civilization, towards the far North. , \" We have spoken, it will be observed, in this section, of life in the Bush ; and our remarks are meant to refer more particularly to emigrants who found it necessary to economize their small capital and extend the payment of the purchase of their farms over the course of 10 years' instal ments, according to the regulations of the provincial government. But, we may add, for the information of large capitalists, that if they take a fancy to a large farm, all that they have to do, is only to express their wishes, another farmer will sell out \u2014 ' clear out' at a moment's no tice\u2014and proceed with pleasure to the ' far west,' and, finally \u2014 for the encouragement of these sons of toil, where capital is restricted to the possession of only a ' stout heart and a strong hand' the declaration of a farmer, who acts in the various capacities of school-master, Church elder, and ' independent elector' \u2014 ' I left my father's house with a bundle, and a Yankee axe over my shoulder, and chopped my way to independence.' \""], [446, "60 COST OF, AND SELECTING A FARM. THE COST OF A FARM. It will be naturally expected that we give some information as to the cost of farms. To do so particularly, is simply impossible, from the fact that the value of a farm or land, cleared or uncleared, depends entirely upon the locality, quality of land, whether cleared, partially cleared, or uncleared. Government land sells at generally $1.25 (or 5s. stg.) per acre, although they may be bought as low as 50 cents (or 2s. stg.) per acre, in some poor localities, whilst some parties, in particular localities, would give land for nothing, merely, to get it \" located.\" There are so many contingencies to determine the price of land here \u2014 different from Great Britain and Ireland \u2014 that the matter cannot be calculated upon the same principle. Thus, for example, you may have to pay $100 (or \u00a320 stg.) for one acre in some of the States, and near large cities, whilst in other localities, 100 miles off, you could buy 20 acres for that sum, and 1000 miles off, you could buy 50 or 100 acres for the same sum, and yet the one acre at \u00a320 stg. will pay you probably as well, if not better, than the 100 acres will do at the same price, because you will get as much, if not more, for the produce of that one acre as you could get off the other 100 acres, if you get any thing at all off them. It all depends, therefore, what you can raise ; the price your produce will fetch ; the quality of the soil, and the location of it, before a proper value can be placed upon land or a farm. A farm of 50 acres, all cleared and in a good state of cultivation, in the States of Pennsyl vania or New York, is sure to command a much higher price than a farm of the same sort in Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, or northern portions of Canada, simply from the fact of their being near to large cash markets, where much higher prices are detained for their produce than those of the latter. Then, again, there is the condition of soil \u2014 how long it may have been worked \u2014 state of fences, roads, farm buildings, and many other things which go to make up the value of a fprm. Partially cleared farms are sold at 5, 10, 15, or 20 to 50 dollars per acre, (\u00a31 to \u00a310,) all depending upon the quantity cleared, and other circumstances as before explained. SELECTING A FARM. In the selection of a farm, we will presume you have arrived out, and wish to select one without first serving some time to another farmer in this country. We would here remind you, however, of the great advantage a man possesses by having lived in the country some time. It enables him to get a thorough knowledge of the best lands in the neighbourhood where be may be an assistant, or in neighbourhoods even distant from there. He knows the peculiarities of the soil; how the land is held; whether it can be got cheap or not ; what he can get it for ; what terms he can make with the owner for payment of the same, that is, how much cash he will have to pay down, if any; what length of time he will get to pay it, and what interest he will have to pay till it is all paid up. These, and sun dry other matters, the man who has resided in the country for some time has a knowledge of, and, consequently, has a great advantage over the man who has just arrived, and who wishes to go upon the land at once, on his own account. You arrive out, therefore, and see a farm advertised in a loeality you think you would like. Amongst other inquiries you make, you ought to be satisfied by a personal inspection of the \" location.\" You ought to buy upon no man's recommendation. Go and judge for yourself. There may be points connected with it which may please others very well, but which may not please you. When there, ascertain how far distant it is to the nearest town, the names and population of that and other towns ; where you can find a cash market for your produce ; what fuel is on the ground, and if none, how far it will be to fetch it, and the cost of doing so; whether the land is a level or \"rolling\" (hilly) land; whether there is fever and ague in the neighbourhood (the latter information you may have to get corroborated from other quarters) ; if there is spring water, or can be got by digging for"], [447, "61 PURCHASING, MEANS, AND TERMS OF PAYMENT. it ; if near to any lakes or swamps; how near to a railroad, or quay on a river where a steamer sails; what sort of roads there are to and from such : if it is a partially cleared farm, how much is cleared; walk or ride over it, and, in fact, over the whole boundaries of the lot. If a man wishes to sell his house, barns, stock and implements, etc., along with a farm, inspect them as to condition and what they are worth. Inquire the nature of the wood on the ground, as wood differs very much in value ; if any tanneries, saw-mills, or other large works are in the neighbourhood ; how near to schools and a medical man ; how far to your nearest neighbours, and who and what they are. Again, in selectinga cleared farm, great care is necessary to see that the land has not been impoverished by over-working, a very common practice in some parts of Canada and the States, where land is never manured, but worked so long as it will yield, the holder then preferring to locate upon some new soil, which requires no trouble to manure, and thus offers his old worn-out soil to whoever is foolish enough to buy it for good rich land, aud pay for it accordingly. PURCHASING, AND TERMS OF PAYMENT. Supposing you are satisfied upon all these and other points, which may occur to your self, your next inquiry is, as to the validity of the title to the property. You may be as sured it is \"O. K.\" (all correct); but we advise you to go and judge for yourself, at the capital of the county in which the property is, where there is a register kept of all pro perties in the said county, with copies of the titles to them, and there you will see the copy for yourself; and, if all right to your mind, then you will see if you are dealing with the lawful owner of such property, and after that, if you think proper, make your bargain with him. In the examination of the title-deed, employ the most respectable attorney in the town, to look over the title-deed with you, in case there may be some, legal informality which might not occur to you. In making your bargain, you may do so, perhaps, for prompt cash down, or you may do it for part cash down, and the remainder to be paid in a certain number of years, so much to be paid annually, and so much percentage charged, till all is paid up. Instances are frequently to be met with, where a family may have purchased a piece of land, but who, not having sufficient to stock it, or clear it, as fast as they would like, do so by degrees, by taking situations where they can be got Thus, there are many work men in the large cities, who have land in some part of the country. During the winter time, they work at some trade in the city, and in the spring proceed to their land, and work there for the season, in chopping, or otherwise improving it. Again, some families, who have farms in. the country, send their sons, if grown up, to work at some trade in the large cities, who, at the end of the season, return to their parents with their savings, either in the shape of money, or agricultural implements, or stock for the farm ; and in this way they go on, from season to season, until they have amassed sufficient funds, or stock, to enable them all to remain at home, and work on the farm. Many Scotch families do so, where the sons can find employment in the large cities. Instead of doing that, others again, as we have stated elsewhere, hire themselves out to neighbouring farmers, who can afford to hire them, and pay them for their labour. Some times the newly-arrived emigrant is too proud to work for a neighbour in this way, and will rather let his farm stand still, until he is compelled by necessity to seek for the em ployment he ought to have been at, probably, months previously. A greater mistake, than that false pride, cannot be made, more particularly in a country, where all kinds of labour is considered equally honourable, and where poverty is neither a disgrace nor a crime."], [448, "62 PURCHASING TOO MUCH LAND. PURCHASING MORE THAN YOU CAN PAY FOR. In purchasing land, however, we would caution you to see that you don't promise to pay it all up sooner than you will be able to perform. If you should not be able to pay all up, when due, the party holding the mortgage, or title-deeds \u2014 till that is done \u2014 may \"fore- close\" upon you \u2014 that is, sell the property, and turn you out of it \u2014 thus, perhaps, losing all you have paid in, and your improvements besides. A common practice, amongst land speculators, is to sell their lands upon a certain time, at as heavy an interest as they can get, and if the land is not all paid up, when due, they take it into their own hands again, or, it may be, they extend it over another five years, perhaps, charging a higher rate of interest still, so that between interest and compound interest, many arc caught in a land speculator's net, which they never get out of, unless they procure the money to pay him off at once. You will thus see the importance of buying little more than you can pay for, at once, cash down, or be certain of being able to pay for when due. Many an industrious farmer is, at the present moment, toiling away, in the vain attempt to get out of the meshes of his land instalments falling due, but who, from buying too much land at first, or who, probably, speculating at a later time, has bought more than he can pay for, not being able to raise sufficient from his produce to pay for it, and who is only working at improving the soil, or clearing more land, for the advantage of the man who holds the title-deeds of the property, who is in no hurry in ejecting the farmer, so long as he sees there is no chance of his ever paying it all up, preferring rather to allow him to remain for some time to clear and otherwise improve the property. When it is sufficiently cleared and improved, then the holder of the title-deed \"forecloses,\" and the poor farmer must turn out Settlers cannot be too careful in what bargains they make for paying their land. They may buy at a time when grain is selling high, and be apt to think it will always remain so. The present low price of grain is eating into the very quick of many a poor farmer's existence, on that account Better, therefore, to buy too little than too much. ln almost all advertisements of lands for sale, you will observe the words \"Terms of payment easy,\" or, \" Terms of payment easy, and to suit the purchaser.\" Beware of these enchanting and seductive words. They are the rocks upon which all your exertions and hopes may be wrecked, like those of hundreds who have gone before you. If your means as an emigrant will permit of it, we advise you, by all means, to procure a farm partly cleared. If it is cleared for 10 acres only, you have something to depend upon at once, and with a moderate stock of provisions laid in, and with your implements and stocking, it will not be long before you raise as much as you will require, in the way of the necessaries of life; besides, you thus pass over the most difficult a'nd heart-breaking time the settler has, viz., in commencing to chop the first tree on his farm, before he can even get a house put upon it, and sometimes before he has gone far at that, and uefore he has raised one crop, his energies or spirits fail him, and he abandons it in despair. In addition to purchasing a farm, and paying for it in the manner we have described, you can, if you think proper, buy what is called a \" Land Warrant,\" of which you will see notices in all money and exchange brokers' windows and offices, having upon them, \" Land Warrants Bought\"\u2014 others, \" Land Warrants for Sale.\" You will find particulars as to what a land warrant is, in a separate article. Before purchasing such, you should, by all means, have reliable information as to where the land is situated, and all particulars regard ing it, just as much as we have previously advised you, as in buying a land warrant, you are buying a farm, or the title-deed to one. (See Land Warrants.) Again, lands are sold or exchanged, very frequently, for house property in cities, or even various description of goods. A store-keeper, in a country place, has perhaps more land than he ean cultivate, and as he cannot sell for cash, he will sell it for any description of saleable goods, for domestic use, which he can turn into cash. You may have neither city property nor goods to sell, for country lots or farms, but we only mention the fact, to show that there are various ways of buying property, as well as paying for it."], [449, "LAND WARRANTS \u2014 WHAT CAN BE DONE. 63 LAND WARRANTS. A Land Warrant is a title to a certain portion of land, given to meritorious soldiers who have been engaged in the war of 1812, and Mexican War, as a pension for services per formed. They are granted in lots of 40, 80, 120, and 160 acres each, of wild, uncleared, or uncultivated lands. The quantity granted depends upon the merits of each individual case. A warrant for 160 acres is equivalent to $200, or $1.25 per acre, that being the price at which government lands are sold. Thus, if a party has got a land warrant for 40 acres, he hands over his warrant for such to government, when they bring such land into the mar ket. He then gets a title to his land, in exchange for his warrant. Until he gets such title, he holds his land warrant, but can sell it for what he likes ; hence, land warrants are bought sometimes very cheap from parties who receive them, but who do not care about \" locating\" on them. Land warrants are thus bought and sold regularly \u2014 same as bills, bv money brokers, as already mentioned. Frequently very fine tracts of land are thus bought cheap by such means \u2014 the title to which is indisputable, once the land warrant is in the hands of the holder; but it is dangerous to purchase such until you know something of the land they represent. Land Warrants are quoted in the \"Bank Note Reporters,\" issued by exchange brokers and bankers. Thus, in September last, we find they are quoted thus: \u2014 160 acres, buying price, 91 cents per acre; selling price, 94 cents per acre. 120 \" \" \" 80 \" \" \" \" \" 83 \" \" \" 80 \" \" \" 91 \" \" \" \" \" 94. \u2022\u25a0 \" \u00ab 40 \" \" \" 110 \" \" \" \" \" 110 \" \" \" \" Market firm ; prices advancing.\" FARMING NOT IN THE WEST. It is an old saying, that many a one looks at a distance for that which is to be found close at hand. That remark, in our opinion, applies, with some force, to many small farmers, who, in coming out to the United States as settlers, rush away at once about a 1000 miles westward, whilst they could make as good investments, perhaps, much nearer homo, save a great deal of expense, and insure as good health as there is to be found any where in America, with the great advantage cf having a ready cash market for all they can produce. We are led into these remarks by a visit which we paid to the farms of some parties in the State of New York, about 100 miles from the City of New York, and within from 4 to 6 miles to one of the leading lines to and from that city. These farmers were, 15 years ago, weavers in Paisley, Scotland; but, seeing the direction manufacturing affairs were taking, became dissatisfied with the prospect which weaving held out to them, as affording any thing like comfort whilst working at it, to say nothing of providing for old age. They, therefore, determined to emigrate, and, on coming here, instead of going away west or north for several hundreds of miles, made a selection of government land-, which were then for sale at the government price of $1.25 (5s. sterling) per acre, in the State of New York, as we have said. Of course, all that land was \"uncleared,\" or a forest, and had to be cleared before they could expect to get, crop, from il. Al though, as may be imagined, they were not well suited for felling trees or \" chopping,\" still, having got up their shanty, and having a stock of provisions to last them till they could grow more, they started and chared first 10 acres \u2014 which in about 12 months yielded crops, and even during the 12 months \u2014 and with a cow, poultry, pigs, and a patch or two of potatoes, they were not long before they turned their land to account. Since then, we happen to know one of them who, out of his 70 acre lot, has about 45 acres cleared, all under cultivation, and producing every kind of grain, all kinds of vegetables, with peaches, grapes, water-melons, etc., in abundance. In answer to a few particular inquiries which"], [450, "64 WEAVERS IN AMERICA \u2014 FARMING WITH CAPITAL. we made, we found that the climate of that district is one of the best adapted for emigrants from Europe to settle in. Equable, free from any thing like fever and ague, no river being near, and high rolling land all round. The soil is every thing that can be desired for growing crops. They can sell, at their own doors, more agricultural produce, for cash, than they can raise, on account of the demand in neighbouring villages, and at tanneries in the district If they should want a city cash market, they can send their produce to New York, which is only a few hours distant ; but as they can get a higher price at home they don't 6end any there. For their own consumption their farm produce affords them poultry, eggs, milk, butter, cheese, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and pork. For fresh meat they and their neighbours kill now and then, and divide a sheep or an ox amongst them. Spring water thev have at the door ; fuel in abundance, and for nothing, out of their acres of forest behind them, which is yet to clear. The stoves adapted for wood fuel, are excellent for cooking with, besides heating the house in winter. In our visit to that district, we were much struck with the highland character of the country, it being so much so, that deer are to be found in the neighbourhood. The un doubted fertility of the soil for dairy produce, is beyond question, as in the immediate neighbourhood \u2014 the far-famed \" Orange County\" \u2014 milk, butter, and cheese are produced. and sent to New York city, where it is prized more highly than that of any other district. What, then, is the position of these men now ? After struggling and working h. rd, some times for themselves and sometimes for neighbours for payment, they are now as indepen dent as the wealthiest man in Christendom, with few anxieties about the future, and as one of them declared to us, they never work more than 4 out of the 12 months. Asking them what they did the other 8, they simply replied, that they enjoyed themselves, and from all appearance, they certainly appear to lead a royal life. On asking the good wife as to how she got on for company \u2014 when in the real vernacular of a \" Paisley body\" \u2014 she said she was never ill off for that, as she \" had mair folk to gang and see than she had time for, and gif I dinna gang and see them, they come and see me.\" Asking her if she did not weary to go back to Scotland. \" Aye, she did sometimes.\" Asking her a last interrogatory, whether she would be as she was now, or as she used to be in Paisley 15 years ago, she shook her head, and simply said, \" But you maunna (must not) say onything aboot that,\" evidently not relishing the recollection of such days. Truly do these Paisley weaver-farmers appear amongst the most contented, free, and happy beings we have seen in America, apparently fully realizing the idea, that \" man wants but little here below\" to make him enjoy life in somewhat of a rational, healthful, and happy manner. One of them told us, that now, he would not take $3000 for his farm. (\u00a3600 stg.,) even although only 45 out of the 70 acres were cleared. Original cost of land \u00a317 10s. The emigrant, in coming to this country, would do well to ponder on the foregoing facts, and ascertain if he cannot settle nearer home, before plunging away into the backwoods or far-west districts, of either the States or Canada, and be careful, as we have said elsewhere, in choosing his land or \" location\" on high rolling land, in preference to flat swampy soils, which, however rich they may be, are often only the hot-beds of mosquitoes, fever and ague, and all night enlivened with the eternal music from the croaking of myriads of frogs. FARMING WITH CAPITAL. In connection with this subject, we subjoin the following extracts from an account of a visit to another farm in the State of New York, (but further north than the foregoing,) by the Hon. Horace Greeley, of the New York Tribune, published in that paper 25th Septem ber, 1858. This farm is situated in Genesee County, and owned by Major A. B. Dickinson, who ap pears to bring scientific farming to his aid, in rendering his property as productive as pos sible. Regarding the soil, the writer says : \u2014"], [451, "WHAT CAN BE DONE ON A LARGE SCALE. 65 \"This is mainly a clay loam, of good medium quality, like that which prevails through the greater portion of Chautauque and other excellent grazing counties of our State. The timber\u2014 mainly beech, maple, hemlock, etc.\u2014 was cleared off from 10 to 30 years ago. It lies some 600 to 800 feet above the surface of the tributary of the Susquehanna at Corning, to which its waters descend, and is not overlooked by any land in its vicinity. For the most part, it slopes moderately to the creek-beds by which it is intersected. There is an abundance of (naturally) quite as good land in our State yet covered by the primitive forest, and for sale at $5 to $10 per acre.\" We may here remark, that the above is a similar description of soil to that held by the weavers from Paisley \u2014 as mentioned in the previous notice \u2014 and the nature of the country is similar. It will be seen that wild or uncleared land can be purchased there from \u00a31 to \u00a32 per acre. Regarding the products of the farm, the writer remarks: \u2014 \" Grass, hay, and beef, are, of course, the staple products of such a farm. More than 200 acres of this \"home farm\" are annually mowed, yielding from 2 to 4 tons per acre, and averaging from li to 3 tons. A single stack near the principal barn contains 120 loads, estimated at 80 to 100 tons. Wheat and Indian corn are grown to but. a moderate extent; of the latter, one piece, planted June 19, (the incessant rains of the last spring forbade an earlier preparation,) will yield 50 or 60 bushels of shelled corn, with 20 wagon-loads of pumpkins, per acre; another piece is but fair. Of buckwheat, many acres are growing; it is a good crop, and no more. Turnips the grasshoppers have taken care of. (It has been dry here for some weeks previous to to-day, and these cormorants are very abundant.) Of peas, there is a large and thrifty field, sowed late, and just beginning to blossom. Should frost hold off till October, the yield must be large, and, if sent green to New York, they would probably pay well. The kitchen garden shows a greater abundance of beets, carrots, parsnips, onions, etc., than I ever before saw on so small an area. The grapes are equally luxuriant.\" On the subject of potato growing, we recommend the following extract to farmers, in the old world as well aB in the new, exhibiting as it does, that off 85 acres of potatoes, a clear profit of at least \u00a31,000 will be made : \u2014 \" But the pride of the farm is its display of the potato. Eighty-five acres are covered with the Irish staple, whereof some thirty acres were planted early, and are now nearly, if not fully, ripe, while the residue were put in from the middle to the last of June, and are now just coming into blossom. Nowhere in America, hardly in Ireland itself, were such fields of potatoes ever seen. They are mainly of Bermuda stock, one remove from the semi-tropical island, the seed having been grown here last year, from imported pota toes of that year's growth. The rows even were half a mile long, and straight as an arrow's flight; there is not a weed to each row, and not a missed hill per acre, and, in one large field, not one to ten acres. Should frost hold off to the 1st of October, (the usual time on these breezy heights,) the yield cannot fall short of three hundred bushels per acre, and may reach four hundred. Nothing like rot is seen: in fact, a glance at those hardy vines, so rank, so green, so thrifty, would convince any one that rot is here, all but impossible. Let me give, as well as I may, from what I learned on the spot, some notion of the means by which 6uch a result has been so nearly attained : \u2014 The ground is first ploughed deeply and thoroughly, each land being marked out by the help of guides, and no crooked furrow allowed, whatever the excuse for it It is then fur rowed three feet apart, with equal exactness as to regularity. A subsoil plough is then run in the furrow, mellowing and pulverizing the soil to as great a depth as the strength of the team will allow. The seed, previously cut, so as to apportion but two eyes to each piece, is dropped on the mellow soil thus pulverized, being zigzagged from side to side of the furrow, so that, though each piece is distant one foot from the preceding, it is eighteen inches from that which lies directly behind it A broad two-horse plough follows, covering the potatoes as deeply as possible ; then a roller rolls the surface flat and compact, and"], [452, "66 SCIENTIFIC FARMING IN STATE OF NEW YORK. the planting is done. The next week, the field is thoroughly harrowed, now and then un covering a potato, but rooting up the embryo weeds, and breaking up any crust which may have formed over the sprouting potato. So soon as the rows have fairly appeared, ploughing between them is commenced, and continued till the 1st of September \u2014 some of these fields having been thus ploughed a dozen times, though they were planted but little more than two months ago. No hoe is taken into the field, but any weed that may have escaped the harrow and the plough, is pulled out by the hand. Of this, however, there is little to do. When the crop is ripe, a potato-digger, drawn by two horses, turns them out as fast as 10 men can pick them up, and thus the work is done. I estimate that this year's crop, delivered at Corning, will have cost Major Dickinson $50 per acre, and that (should no untimely frost blast his hopes) they will sell there for $150 per acre, giving him a clear profit of at least $5000, and perhaps $8000 on his potato crop alone. For 1858, 1 call that doing well. The principal, almost the only, fertilizer applied to these spacious potato fields was turf ashes, prepared by the process I shall now endeavour to describe. Paring and Burning. \u2014 I have read much of this process in English works, but, like most people, I had little faith in what I was grossly ignorant of I here saw it in progress, and will endeavour to give some idea of it. Along the sides of the road, there is apt to be a pretty thick turf, especially where the soil is clayey and moist, and has not been disturbed for years. This is ploughed up thor oughly, and left a few days to dry ; then a fire is kindled upon one end of it, fed by any chips, roots, pieces of stumps, etc., which may be accessible, and, when well started, the dryest sods are piled on, then others, until a small pit is constructed, from which a white smoke faintly issues. While this was kindling, the operator has started another; while this is getting hold, he is covering this, and so on. Two hours after starting, a week's rain would not extinguish one of these pits; it may burn more slowly, but, with a few sods thrown on whenever the fire seems on the point of bursting out, it will burn till the last turf has become ashes. The land being ploughed, Major Dickinson estimates that a good, experienced hand will burn 200 bushels per day, and that 100 bushels will suffice for an acre of potatoes. The total cost of the 200 bushels need not exceed $2 ; their value is from $12 to $20. Of course any other grass land may answer as well for this purpose as road sides; but where these are abundant and convenient, there is no need of looking further. And, though it is very true that gravelly or sandy lands afford no turf equal in value to that obtained from clay loam, yet I doubt that there is one farmer in our State who might not obtain suitable turf at little or no cost if he would. Here is one who will try. Salt and plaster are extensively used as fertilizers by Major Dickinson. He procures the former (refuse salt) by the boat-load from Syracuse, at a cost here of some 20 cents per bushel. Plaster costs him $4 per ton at Corning. He attributes his immunity from rust in good part to salt. As to plaster, he considers il good if applied to any crop at any time, but he uses most of it on grass land, especially on meadows. I am not sure whether it was he or another friend who said he should prefer to sow it immediately after taking off a crop of hay.\" It must be borne in mind, that the above results are from a farm in a part of the country thus described by Mr. Greeley : \u2014 \" A region of ragged forests, bushy clearings, scanty crops, and thinly-scattered habita tions, so ill adapted to human comfort, that one could hardly wish there were more of them, unless they were better. The road is such as this style of country produces; only at intervals and wilh difficulty admitting of the passage of one wagon by another. Wind ing upward through a wide ravine, you come at last to the ample farm\u2014 some 800 acres in area \u2014 which Major Dickinson has hewed out of the primitive wilderness, while several other farms, surrounding this and adjacent to it, belong to the same owner, and are mainly cultivated under his direction.\" The above example clearly shows what can be done on a large seale, by men possessed of ample means, and yet, at the same time, quite possible to accomplish on a smaller scale, proportionate to the means at command."], [453, "FEVER AND AGUE \u2014 SHERIFF'S SALES \u2014 LAND MEASURE. 67 FEVER AND AGUE. A story is told of a man, out west, being so bad with the \" shakers,\" that every tooth rattled so in his head, that you could hear the noise of them at the far end of a 60-acre farm. Of course, that is an American yarn, and however amusing it may be, every one who has even witnessed, far less, experienced personally, the dreadful sufferings of an attack of fever and ague, or the \" chills,\" will at once admit that they are any thing but a joke \u2014 bot a disease which seizes the unfortunate sufferer, sometimes, all in a moment \u2014 lasting for days \u2014 and in many cases, becomes so fixed in the system, that it is never got rid of, no mat ter in what part of the world he may reside. Fever and ague is brought on by the inhalation of the miasma or poisonous vapours which rise from flat, swampy, and river bottom soils, and in fact is often one of the attend ant consequences upon the breaking of \" virgin soil,\" wherever situated. Although denied by many parties in different parts of the States and Canada, every newly-opened district is more or less subject to it, unless Bituated in very hilly districts, where there is a good circulation of air, and away from rivers and 6wamps. In newly-opened soil, in some dis tricts of the western States, as well as in Canada, this is the greatest scourge the settler has to dread in looking out for a location, and it therefore becomes doubly his interest, in searching for such, to find out correct information on that very point, as he must know that without good health, and strength, he will do no good anywhere. In districts which have been cleared for some time, it may be completely gone, or rarely to be heard of; still, even in the neighbourhood of all large cities, where there are swampy places, and stagnant water lying about, fever and ague is to be found to this day. This is one of the many other reasons, why settlers from Britain should not be in a hurry fixing upon land, until they ascertain something for certain as to its locality, in this respect, and, if they ean manage to procure it, to give preference to land which has been cleared for some time. It is a very difficult matter, for strangers, to get correct information on this subject, as if they inquire in any particular locality regarding it, there are so many parties interested in deceiving them on that point, and who do not like to acknowledge that their locality is one subject of fever and ague, however true it may be. SHERIFF'S SALES. A sheriff's sale is the result of a man not paying the amount due on his property, for local taxes, or for balance of purchase-money due. For, however small the amount may be, many a poor farmer has been cleaned out of his whole lands, house, etc., who was not able to pay the amount for such, when due. At sheriff's sales, farms are sold for mere trifles \u2014 that occasion being taken by many parties, to purchase land cheap, which they undoubtedly do, however hard the case may be for the poor farmer, who has spent his last dollar, per haps, iu improving the land, and who is then obliged to see it pass from his hands, to pay some trifling sum. Men with small capital frequently, in this way, pick up farms very cheap, and, practising by the experience of the former proprietor, take care to avoid a sheriff's sale, in their own case. Farms, thus sold, are advertised in the county papers where the land is situated, and during the last 12 months, they have been painfully fre quent, both in the States and Canada.

For the information of readers generally, but more particularly for that large class, viz., agriculturists, who may have some idea of emigrating either to the United States or Cana da, we subjoin a few remarks on farm stock and produce, with prices for buying and selling the same. In quoting prices, it must be borne in mind that the price paid for stock, or that realized on produce, depends altogether upon where the stock is bought, and the produce is sold. The nearer to a good market\u2014 but particularly on the seaboard, or east ern cities \u2014 the prices always rule much higher for all descriptions of stock and produce, than it does in the north or western States. The prices quoted are those realized in the western States and Canada, as particularized which will so far give a general idea of the value of the different items named. We may here mention that the facts contained in this and the following article, entitled \" Agricultural Products \u2014 Fruits and Flowers,\" has been supplied for this work specially, by a gentleman many years a resident in both the United States and Canada, and one thoroughly qualified, from his professional position, to supply accurate information on such vitally important topics. Cattle. \u2014 The common kind of cattle which are used, in all the States and Canada, are a breed whose origin is not definitely known, but is doubtless the result of a mixture of various British, and other varieties from the continent of Europe. In recent years, the importation of choice animals of the Durham, Devon, Hereford, and Ayrshire breeds \u2014 but principally the Durham \u2014 has produced a great improvement in the general character of cattle, in particular districts. Pure bred Durhams, or short horns, of as pure breed as any in Britain, may be seen in the States of Kentucky, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, and Upper Canada, and the effect of their cross, with the so-called native breed, is a great improvement in the quality of the flesh, and appearance of the animals. Pure bred animals bring as high a price, if not higher, than the same sorts do in Britain ; as high as $1,000 (\u00a3200 stg.) is no unusual thing to pay for a fine Durham bull. Oxen are to be found of all breeds, but principally the common sort. They are in general use for heavy draught work, and are considered better than horses, for a new farm, whether woodland or prairie. In the older States, they are, to a great extent, superseded by the horse. The harness of an ox is of the most primitive kind, and consists of a yoke with two wooden bows, (or collars,) one for the neck of each animal ; between the bows, and attached to the beam, is an iron ring, to which a chain is fastened, connecting the cattle with the article drawn. Traces are never used. The price of a yoke of oxen varies with the quality, and the locality where bought. From $80 (\u00a316 stg.) to $100 (\u00a320 stg.) is a common price, at the present, for a yoke (pair) which have been broken. In the western States, and the newer districts of Canada, the ox is used for logging (drawing logs) in the woods \u2014 and on the prairies of the \"great west\" for breaking new land. In fact, oxen are the most useful animals about a farm, particularly iu wooded dis tricts in Canada, and some parts of the States. They can draw logs where a horse would \". tear himself to pieces\" \u2014 draw wagon loads of manure, lumber, etc., and plough over any sort of ground. They may be slow, but are invaluable on a new farm. Fat Cattle rate higher, of course, than oxen ; but their prices are greatly influenced by the rates paid in the great eastern cities, (especially New York,) whose markets are sup plied by Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and even as far west as Illinois. Cows. \u2014 In the dairy regions, good cows are often found \u2014 but no breed is exclusively used. Neither the farmers of Canada or the States have as yet propagated any particular breed, with an eye to the greater production of milk. Ayrshires and Alderneys are few and far between. Good cows bring prices proportionate to their milking qualities. From $20 (\u00a34 stg.) to $50 (\u00a310 stg.) may be considered the extremes \u2014 $30 (\u00a36 stg.) an every-day price. Milk. \u2014 The price of milk, in the western cities, is from 3 to 6 cents per quart (1^ to 3d. stg.)."], [455, "DAIRY PRODUCE \u2014 HORSES \u2014 MULES, ETC. 69 Butter is sold from 10 to 20 cents (5d. to 10<_. stg.) per lb., according to quality. It is always used slightly salted\u2014 never quite fresh, as in Scotland\u2014 except by the Germans. Cheese sells at from 6 to 10 cents (3d. to 5<_. stg.) per lb. There is little sold, excepting the better qualities. The western reserve of the State of Ohio produces more butter and cheese than any other section of the same size in America, and it is from that quarter great quantics are sent to the British market. It is a part of Northern Ohio, and is bordered by Lake Erie on the north \u2014 but does not include the north-western part of the State. The soil of the Reserve produces fine grass and clover, but is not good for wheat or Indian corn. In that district the land is well cleared. Horses. \u2014 The horses commonly used in the West are light, wiry, and active \u2014 well adapted to the roads; and the same animal i3 used for the saddle, wagon, carriage, and plough, and looks and works well in all. For a number of years, the Morgan breed \u2014 originally from Vermont, (U. S.) \u2014 has engrossed much of the attention of dealers and farmers. They are not large animals, but have often rather larger heads than can be considered handsome; otherwise, they are strong, compact built, with good bottom, and make capital roadsters, and trot with excellent action, and very fast. Much of their blood is now diffused through out the West. They, no doubt, contain a large percentage of the blood of the Canada pony, which is of French extraction, hardy, long-lived, and high-spirited, but small. Great value is placed upon the trotting powers of the horses in America \u2014 particularly in the States; and if the American blood horses have not always been successful at the races iu England, their trotters, or \" rackers,\" or \" pacers,\" would, we fancy, show to greater ad vantage in trotting matches. These \" rackers,\" as they are called, have a peculiar style of trot quite different from the ordinary straightforward step of ordinary English trotting. The motion of a racker, is that of a sort of rolling-abont motion, whilst he trots, and the action of the horse is any thing but graceful to our ideas of trotting. When going at a slow trot, he appears to be half walking, half trotting. A good trotting horse is expected to travel at the rate of 2 minutes and 40 seconds to the mile ; hence the common remark is applied to any thing which is fast, being a two-forty. (See Amusements in America.) Thorough-bred Horses. \u2014 There are several very fine thorough-bred race horses, either imported or of imported parentage, in the West. \"Bonny Scotland,\" half brother to the late famous British mare, \" Blink Bonny,\" is owned by Messrs. Reber and Kutz, of Fair field County, Ohio, who use him for the exclusive purpose of stock-getting. The same gen tlemen own a number of famous turf horses. R. A. Alexander, of Kentucky, owns \" Lex ington,\" said to be the fastest horse in America, but now blind. He is also kept for breeding purposes. Draught Horses. \u2014 Clydesdale and Norman horses are owned by a few. There are also a few stallions of the heavy draught breeds of Great Britain scattered over Ohio and the States between that and Iowa. Good horses of the common sort may be had from $80 (\u00a316) to $160 (\u00a330) each. Often enormous prices are paid for fancy stock. Donkeys are nowhere to be seen in America \u2014 we presume being too slow and stub born to be useful there \u2014 not suiting the Yankees' idea of progress. Mules. The stranger will be struck with the immense number of mules in use in mostly all the large cities in the United States. We have counted as many as 60 in one railroad station (in Philadelphia), employed in teams of 6 and 8 each, drawing the cars about the yard and through the city. They are employed drawing carts, omnibuses, wagons, and even buggies or carriages, although seldom the latter. We have seen them frequently 12 to 14 hands high\u2014 splendid fellows\u2014 handsome in the extreme, excepting their big heads and long ears. The larger mules are far stronger than horses, are easier kept, and far more durable. Great quantities are reared in Kentucky, and other districts on the River Ohio. The stallions are largely imported from Malta, and find their way all over the States nearly. Good, handsome mules sell high\u2014 say from $21 iO to $400 (\u00a340 to \u00a380) per pair. The feed for horses, generally, is oats and hay, or a mixture of oats, bran, Indian corn, etc., ground together, and sold as \" feed.\""], [456, "70 WOOL, SHEEP, PIGS, AND POULTRY. Wool anu Sheep.\u2014 In August, 1858, wool averaged the following: Ohio, 35 cents (Hid.) per pound; Michigan, 34 cents (lid.); Indiana, 30 cents (15<_.); Illinois, 31 cents (15|<_.); and Wisconsin, 32 cents (16<_.). Ohio is the wool-producing State, but other States, 'and Canada, produce a great deal. The common sheep is a sort of mixed breed, neither very good for mutton or wool ; but the Southdowns and Leicesters are getting to be more com mon, especially the former, and much good mutton and wool is the result The Spanish, Saxon, and Silician breeds are propagated extensively for producing fine wool, and there are many fine flocks of pure blood in the West. Upper Canada, Ohio, and Kentucky have a great many Southdowns. Twelve years ago, sheep, in Ohio (as in Australia) were killed for their hides and tallow ; this is no longer the case. Then they could be bought at $1 a head, alive, with their fleeces ; now, the price is higher, and the mutton of far better quality. All the famed breeds of Europe are to be met with in America. The price of sheep varies with the breed; but good common may be bought at $2 each. The price of lamb does not differ much from that of mutton. For perfectly new portions of the country, it is difficult to fix the price at any thing, as it varies with the supply and demand to a much greater extent than ever occurs in the settled districts. In general, however, they rate higher in the eastern than in the western cities. Good mutton sells at from four to eight cents per pound, a preference being always given to the hind quarter of all animals, from a deer to a bullock. Pigs. \u2014 Are to be found of all breeds, with any number of the long-nosed, slab-sided ill-looking grunters, that once were the rule \u2014 with few exceptions \u2014 all over the west. Suf folk, are now in favour \u2014 and Berkshires, Chinese, and many other sorts are becoming common. The result is, pork has improved in quality \u2014 and it is the staple animal food of the rural dis tricts. Pigs require little care : they run in the woods during the summer, and in autumn, or \" fall\" as it is generally called, they are driven into the pens, and fed with Indian corn. This pork is good ; but thousands of hogs are fattened every year on distillery slops, until they become almost a mass of soft blubber, and great quantities, diseased in that 6tate, are killed, salted, and packed for exportation. This article is not bought by the western people for home use. Pork, by the carcass, sells during the killing season \u2014 in December \u2014 at from three and a half to six cents per pound, dressed. Hams, smoked, at from seven to twelve cents per pound during the whole year. Shoulders two cents less. No one buys food for the purpose of feeding pigs, but rather buy pigs to eat the corn. Poultry. \u2014 Breeds as in Britain. The chicken-fever, that attacked, a few years ago almost every one, has subsided entirely. When at its height, shanghaies were all the rage, and the feathered population increased at a rapid rate, and big prices were paid for big birds. Now, decent-looking fowls may be bought at sixpence to a shilling sterling each, and eggs at 8 to 12 cents (id. to 6<_.) a dozen. Poultry of all kinds is cheap. Geese, 25 to 50 cents (Is. to 2s.) each; turkeys, 75 cents to $1 (3s. to 4s. stg.); and ducks, 50 cents (2s.) to 62 cents (2s. 6a?.) per pair. Bees. \u2014 Many-years ago, bees were more common than now, in consequence of the great increase in later times of the destructive bee-moth. The honey-producing plants are numerous, consisting of white clover, buckwheat, lime-tree or bass-wood, also the Lorio dendron, or tulip-tree \u2014 with a host of others. The honey is often of very fine quality. Farmers, when sending their produce to market, will do well to attend to the following directions when sending it to a commission agent to sell for them. We quote the following from a circular of a respectable commission agent: \u2014 \" Notice to Consignors of Farm Produce. \u2014 Put up every thing in neat order. Mark plain, indelible directions on every package, including weight, with tare, count, and name of articles. Also tack a bill of particulars inside of one package, marked ' Bill,' and always send one by mail, with noace when and how things are forwarded. \" Commissions. \u2014 For selling berries, fruits, etc., where packages are returned, and on small lots of stuff, 10 per cent. Other farm produce, generally, 5 per cent. \" Butter only brings highest quotations when perfectly made and sweet, in small, neat packages.\""], [457, "AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS \u2014 WHEAT. 71 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS\u2014 FRUITS AND FLOWERS. Wheat. \u2014 The northern States and Canada are the principal wheat-growing portions of North America. Kentucky and Tennessee produce good wheat, but the quantity is not great; these States are, however, well adapted to the growth of this staple, but, as free and slave labour cannot coexist in one community, and both thrive, their farming interests suffer. The labour of slaves will, and always does, deteriorate the land, in consequence of the mis erable methods of cultivation, and the want of any incentive to exertion except the lash Emigration to the south is at a stand-still, except to the south-westerly State of Missouri, and that State will ere long become a free one. The clay lands of Ohio are well adapted to wheat culture, and, when first cleared, excel lent crops are obtained ; but in consequence of a want of knowledge as to the proper rota tion of crops, and an exhausting system of tillage, these naturally fertile fields soon exhibit a marked decrease in both quantity and quality. A great error seems to have crept into the minds of farmers, that certain soils are inexhaustible ; working on this hypothesis, they have demonstrated the reverse to their own cost. This is the case, also, in Canada, and in the valley of the Genesee, in the State of New York. In the States west of Lakes Michigan and Huron, white wheat does not thrive, and Mediterranean takes its place. In prairie soils the \" fall\" sown plants are thrown out hy the frost, unless well covered with snow. The soil is too loose and porous, being composed, in genera], of decayed vegetable matters, mixed with fine sand. Alumina does not, as a general thing, form a large percentage of such soils, but the reverse. They are rich \u2014 ex tremely so, but a bad system of culture may, and will, exhaust them. There is great difference in the quality of the different soils of North America, for the production of wheat. Some, with the best methods of cultivation, will produce very light crops, while others, with the poorest tillage, will, for a few years, amply reward the farmer. As a general rule \u2014 with common cultivation \u2014 the number of bushels per acre does not equal that of Britain, with the improved systems of cultivation now practised there. In 1858, the average per acre in Ohio, did not exceed 9 bushels, but that was owing to the peculiarity of the season, and the extreme wet spring ; so much rain having fallen, that in Lake Erie, and, in fact, the whole chain of great lakes, the water rose several feet, and the low lands were flooded, killing the whole crop. This was the case along the course of the Mississippi River also, where several of the cities and towns were rendered almost unin habitable for the time, and Cairo was near, as well could be, destroyed. The same cause hindered planting Indian corn (maize) until a month after the usual time. Wheat, in America, is injured greatly by insect enemies. The Hessian fly (Cecidomyia destructor) and the wheat midge (C tritica) are very injurious in the older portions of the country. The chinch bug (Micropus leucopterus is extremely hurtful in the south and south-west, but never reaches Canada. Rust and smut prevail to a considerable extent, and much loss is suffered thereby, but a careful selection of seed, and a thorough washing and steeping in the manner usually prac tised in Britain, with good tillage and under-draining, will almost entirely prevent their development. In selecting a farm in America, it is absolutely necessary to take into consideration the use to -which it is to be put \u2014 whether as a grazing or a grain farm. If wheat is intended to be extensively raised, then land with the same kind of soil as the best wheat-growing land in Europe should be selected, if possible. White wheat is produced of excellent quality in Canada, the deep snows preventing the throwing out by frost, and protecting the young plant from injury during the winter. This is not the case south of the lakes ; for there the snows are seldom deep, and often thaw entirely away several times during the winter. On the prairie lands of the north-west the snow lies better, and is occasion ally very deep. The usual price of white wheat per bushel, in the district between Chicago (Illinois) and"], [458, "72 INDIAN CORN AND OATS. Cleveland (Ohio), is one dollar ($1) ; sometimes it is higher, at others, lower; but it is sel dom less than that. In localities removed from the lines of travel the price is less. In many localities \u2014 especially in Canada\u2014 the farmers kept themselves poor by running into debt to the storekeepers, pledging themselves to pay in wheat, and were thus at the mercy of their creditors, many of whom fleeced them thoroughly, paying any price for the article they liked. This miserable system is still carried on at some of the out-of-the-way places. No emigrant should allow himself to get into the clutches of such land-sharks as these. Corn (Maize, or Indian Corn).\u2014 This is one of the great staples of the country south of the lakes, and is universally styled \"corn.\" Canada is not well adapted for its growth \u2014 although some is grown there. A sandy loam is best adapted for it, and many fields, con taining hundreds of acres, are planted with this healthful and sweet grain. South of the Ohio River it is grown to an immense extent, yielding very large crops. One hundred bushels to the acre have been often obtained ; and, under nearly every circumstance, the yield is far greater than that of any other cereal. Corn is always cultivated in hills, and worked both ways, with a cultivator, or double shovel plough. The latter is the best implement. The planting varies with the locality; a good rule is to plant when all danger of late frosts is over \u2014 say the beginning or middle of May. A crop of corn is often raised immediately after clearing woodland, or breaking prairie. In the former case, no ploughing is performed \u2014 but the planter goes along, with an old axe, and driving the blade into the ground, breaks the surface, and then drops three or four kernels, covering them up. When the corn comes up, it is hoed by hand. In old land, the ground is well ploughed previous to planting, and every weed is kept from the field. Corn is less liable to injury, and the crop is more certain, than almost any other. Frost, in the early part of autumn, is most to be dreaded \u2014 before the grain has thoroughly ripened. In planting time, several birds dig up the grain and devour it \u2014 and many insect grubs also eat it. Field mice will sometimes commit a great amount of mischief in this way. The spindle worm \u2014 the caterpillar of a moth \u2014 enter the hollow stalks, when young, end, eat ing the interior, destroys the stalk, and with it all hope of the promised grain. Raccoons are very fond of the ears, when grown, and the farmers' boys make a business of hunting them, with dogs, in the moonlight nights. The stalks are eaten by cattle, and help to eke out the supply of winter provender. Much of the corn raised is given to hogs for fattening purposes, and immense quantities are used in the manufacture of bad whiskey. Corn bread is excellent, and rye or wheat flour is usually mixed with the corn meal. The price of corn, per bushel, averages about 40 cents (Is. Sd. stg.); corn meal, 1-} cents (3 farthings) per pound. Oats. \u2014 The climate of Canada is well adapted for the growth of oats, and a good article is produced there. In the western States, the grain is light and \" chaffy ;\" farther south it ceases to be productive. In Canada \u2014 and also in the State of Vermont, and State of Maine \u2014 oatmeal is made, and used for human food ; but this is not the case in Ohio, and the States west of that. There, oats are used entirely for feeding horses. The price per bushel is about 30 cents (Is. 3d. stg.) average. The past season, 1858, they were higher, in consequence of the failure of the crop from rust, a disease that, previous to that time, the oat was exempt from. Too little care is taken in the cultivation of this grain. Rye grows well, but is very liable to ergot Its use as food, for man, is somewhat on the decline. Average price, about 50 cents (2s. stg.) per bushel. Barlet. \u2014 Not grown for food, but generally used in manufacturing ale and beer. Sel dom given to stock, for food. Potatoes are still affected with the rot, yet pretty good crops are often obtained. The price is very variable ; and they are sometimes sold as low as 25 cents (Is. stg.) per bushel, and at others as high as $1.50 (6s. stg.) \u2014 50 cents (2s. 6tg.) is a common price."], [459, "VEGETABLES, FRUITS AND FLOWERS. 73 Vegetables.\u2014 All kinds are good and plentiful, and much used. Melons of all kinds are very cheap and good. Squashes are fine eating. Pumpkins are made into pies, but their chief use is to feed cows. Fruit.\u2014 AppleB are abundant and good. They are of the best quality, but not a sure crop. Plums, the same. Pears do not thrive well, in many places ; but currants, and the smaller fruits, with the exception of gooseberries, are all that can be desired. Grapes are good, in many sections, and excellent wine is produced. The south shore of Lake Erie is peculiarly well adapted to the growth of this fruit, and almost every one \" sits under his own vine.\" Citrons grow in great abundance, and make a delicious preserve. In Iowa and Northern Wisconsin, the apple does not thrive \u2014 the winters being too severe ; neither does the peach : that is the case also in some parts of Canada with the latter fruit The varieties of apples, and, indeed, of all fruits, include all the famous European sorts, and a host of others raised in the country. The latter are generally best. American apples are always in demand for exportation. Orchards are both numerous and large \u2014 a farm with out one is considered so much less valuable. Every old farm has one or more, often con taining hundreds of trees, and occasionally thousands. Cider is made extensively, and is often sold at $1 a barrel, of 34 gallons \u2014 $2.00 is high. No peculiar kinds of fruit are used for this purpose, as in England. Cider is a common beverage with farmers. Vinegar is made from it, of excellent quality, and is much used for pickling. Apples sell at from 20 (Is. stg.) to 50 cents (2s. stg.) per bushel, when plenty ; but in scarce seasons, the price is doubled \u2014 and often more. Peaches are sometimes as low as 50 cents (2s. stg.), at others as high as $5 and $6 (20s. to 24s. stg.) per bushel. They are grown in the open orchard, on untrained trees, like apples. We once saw a barrelful sold for 18a. sterling, and a barrel of apples for the same price. Grapes are sold at from 5 to 8 cents ('lid. to id. stg.) per pound \u2014 but ere long will be cheaper. Every one who has a spare rood of land plants a grape-vine, and in two or three years its purple clusters gladden his heart The extreme north-west and north-eastern States are not, however, adapted to the vine ; neither is the greater portion of Canada. The banks of the Ohio River, the south shore of Lake Erie, Missouri, probably Kansas, the south part of Indiana, and Michigan, are all adapted to its growth, and will, ere long, supply the markets of America with good wine. Flowers. \u2014 In the cities and suburbs flowers are extensively grown, of nearly all the sorts cultivated in Britain. Every yard is gay with bright blossoms. Dahlias, roses, and verbenas, grow and flower well. Many plants, however, that withstand the climate of Britain in the winter are unable to do so in the northern States. Several British native plants, when grown iu these States \u2014 the daisy, for example \u2014 die during the heat of summer, in consequence of the lack of moisture. Pansies \u2014 unless planted in rather moist soil, with a northern exposure \u2014 do not flower well. The heather \u2014 dear to the heart of every Scots man \u2014 will not grow at all. It needs a moist atmosphere, and must feel the air among its tiny leaves. The dry, warm winds of midsummer, in all North America, burn up, and soon entirely destroy its tender leaves, and the plant dies. The greatest care can preserve it for a few seasons only \u2014 and that in a green-house. The lover of flowers will find no difficulty in satisfying his cravings for such pets, for he can cultivate with ease hundreds of choice sorts. Nurseries and seedsmen are found in every town of any size ; and the choice bulbs of Holland, and seed of annuals from England, can be had at reasonable rates. No one need be without the beautiful in nature, if willing to work. Peas grow well ; but in the States are much injured by a little beetle \u2014 the pea-bug (Bruchus Pisi) and every pea, if examined, will be found to contain \u2014 if green \u2014 a little mag got; if ripe \u2014 a small, grayish bettle. Seed peas have to be imported from Canada, where this destroyer is either unknown, or less numerous. For this reason, peas are cultivated as a garden crop only, and are never fed to stock.

Foe general information, but more particularly for the information of parties who think of emigrating to the New World as agricultural settlers, we annex a few particulars of the description of houses which are common in the country \u2014 from the primitive \"shanty\" to the complete farm house, with barns, etc. The newly-arrived emigrant who settles in a part of the country where logs can be got cut up cheaply at a saw-mill, or where trees on his property are scarce, generally erects what is called a \" shanty,\" made of sawn lumber (deal boards), something after the fashion of the temporary erec tions put up for the use of \" navvies\" when railroads are being made. On lands which are \" pre-empted,\" by squatters, such are generally put up in the style of the illustration No. 1, which, in all parts No. 1. \u2014 A Shanty. of America, is very generally the first home of the emigrant. Another style of house is that represented by No. 2, which is more substantial erection, with, in general, c ne or two windows and a door at the front, which may be called an emigrant's hut. Either of these two styles of homes, and sometimes the following one, No. 3,' are erected by the neighbors, who are always glad to welcome all new settlers, and render them every assistance in their pow-er. The \" shanty,\" however, is more properly repre sented in Nos. 1 and 2. The \" log house\" or \" log-cabin,\" as it is called sometimes, is the next de scription of house which follows \u2014 sometime after No. 2. \u2014 Emigrant's Hut."], [462, "76 ,0G HOUSE AS IT IS, AND AS IT MIGHT BE. settlement \u2014 incases where it has not been made the first erection. Log-houses, iu general, are comfortable, or, at all events, are capable of being made so. Illustration No. 3 will give an excellent idea of a \"log-cabin as it is.\" When it forms the first erection, it is put together roughly, but solid ; and by plastering with clay, such houses are rendered as warm as any stone house. The logs, being notched at each end and placed crosswise on the top of each other, are fitted in, and will with stand the heaviest storm of wind, rain, or snow. There is, however, great room for improvement in the erection and comfort of 6ueh houses. The cost of such erec tions may be set down as \u2022 nothing, thetimber being taken off the emigrant's laud, or supplied along \u2022with the labour free, by his nearest neigh- \" bours. The illustration No. 3 faithfully represents tlie log-houses in general use in all parts of America ; there being seldom more than one small window and a door at the front, with another small window and the fire place and chimney at one end of the house. In some few cases, log-houses present a very different appearance, more like our illustri tration No. 4, of a \"log house as it might be,\" with a veranda in front, and vines or other plants creeping up the rustic pillars in front, as well as round the doorway and ends of the projecting roof, presenting, sometimes, pictures of rural neatness and comfort Whilst the log-cabins lik \"P0\"_-_ Q <i im __i-\\mrM-__!__,_1 _if _Am_ are composed of som times only one apartment, we give a ground plan where four apartments might be made with great ease.

It is made of sawn lumber, for the most part, with shingles for the roof."], [463, "77 WESTERN COTTAGES AND FARM HOUSES.

The first story has a main and No. 8. \u2014 End View of House No. 1."], [464, "78 GROUND PLAN OF FARM HOUSE. back entrance, the former covered by a porch ; a parlour, a living-room, a kitchen of good size, and ample closet accommodations. \" The kitchen part of the house, in order to save expense in the foundation, and to gain more height in the garret, is sektwo risers, or about sixteen inches, lower than the main No. 10. \u2014 Plan of First Floor of No. 1. No. 9. \u2014 Cellar Plan of No 1. floor. The attic, or second floor, affords two fine bedrooms, with closets, and a useful open garret. The peculiar feature of this design is the one chimney, which answers for all the rooms. The flue of the kitchen fire-place is brought over to the chimney at the ceiling of the intervening closet, so as to be entirely out of sight and with out taking away any room, and the parlour has a blind mantle with a stove-pipe hole, connecting also with the chimney by passing under the stairs. No. 11. \u2014 Plan of Second Floor. \" This cottage can be built for $595 ; or if in closed with clear, narrow clap-boards, for about $16 more.\" We might give illustrations of still larger farm and country houses, but prefer giving what is considered to be an excellent design for barns and outhouses about a farm, as represented in illustrations Nos. 12 and 13. Such design is suitable for a size of barn much larger than is in general use, and is given to furnish a model of one which can be adopted for almost any size. Regarding this model, we quote from the designer, who says : The body of the main barn is 100 feet long by 50 feet wide, the posts ten feet high above the sill, making 9 bents. The beams are 14 feet above the sills, which is the height of the inner posts. The position of the floor and bays is readily under stood from the plan. The floor, for a grain barn, is 14 feet wide, but may be contracted to 12 feet for one exclusively for hay. The area in front of the bays is occupied with a sta tionary horse-power, and with machinery for various farm operations, such as threshing, Bheiling corn, cutting straw, crushing grain, etc., all of which is driven by bands from drums on the horizontal shaft overhead, which runs across the floor from the horse-power"], [465, "79 BARN AND OUTHOUSES. on the other side ; this shaft being driven by a cog-wheel jn the perpendicular shaft round which the horses travel. \" A passage four feet wide extends between the bays and the stables, which occupy the two wings. This extends up to the top of the bays, down which the hay is thrown for feeding, which renders this work as easy and convenient as possible. \"The floor of the main barn is three feet higher than that of the stables. This will allow a cellar under it, if desired \u2014 or a deeper extension of the bays \u2014 and it allows stor age lofts over the cattle, with sufficient slope of roof. A short flight of steps at the ends of each passage admits easy access from the level of the barn floor. \"The line of mangers is two feet wide. A manure window is placed at every 12 feet The stalls are double ; that is, for two animals each, which are held to their places by a No. 12. \u2014 Perspective View of Barn. rope and chain, attached to a staple and ring at each corner of the stall. This mode is preferred to securing by stanchions. A pole or scantling, placed over their heads, prevents them from climbing 60 as to get their feet into the mangers, which they are otherwise very their feet into the mangers, which they are otherwise very apt to do. \" The sheds, which extend on the three sides of the barn, and touch it at the rear end, are on a level with the stables. An inclined plane, from the main floor through the ruid- die of the back shed, forms a rear egress for wagons and carts, descending three feet from the floor. The two rooms, one on each side of this rear passage, 16 by 34 feet, may be used for housing sick animals cows about to calve, or any other purpose required. The stables at the front ends of the sheds are convenient for teams of horses or oxen, or they may be fitted for wagon-houses, tool-houses, or other purposes. The rooms, 16 feet square at the inner corners of the sheds, may be used for weak ewes, lambs, or for a bull-stable. \" Racks or mangers may be fitted up in the open sheds for feeding sheep or young cattle, and yards may be built adjoining, on the rear, six or eight in number, into which they may run and be kept separate. Barred partitions may separate the different flocks. Bars may also inclose the opening in front, or they may, if required, be boarded up tight Step-lad ders are placed at convenient intervals, for ascending the sheds lofts."], [466, "80 BEE-HOUSE, AND COST OF BUILDING. \" A granary over the machine-room is entered by a flight of stairs. Poles extending from bay to bay, over the floor, will admit the storage of much additional hay or grain. As straw can not well be kept when exposed to the weather, and is at the same time be coming more valuable as its uses are better understood, we would suggest that the 6pace on these cross poles be reserved for its deposit from the elevator from threshing grain, or until space is made for it in one of the bays. \" A one-sided roof is given to the sheds (instead of a double-sided), to throw all the water on the outside, in order to keep the interior of the yards dry. Eave-troughs take the water from the roofs to cisterns. The cisterns, if connected by an underground pipe, may be all drawn from by a single pump if necessary.\" The whole erection consists of wood, exclusively. Tlie annexed illustration (No. 14) represents a design for a rustic apiary or bee-house, \u2014 of which we have seen several in use in different parts of the States \u2014 with the hives placed in wooden boxes, interlined with glass, through which the intere_ting sight of the No. 14. \u2014 An Apiary or Bee-House. manufacturing of honey is seen, whilst the \" busy bees\" are at work. Honey forms one of the many dishes which adorns the tables of intelligent farmers, forming as it does an agreeable variety to the various preserves with which their tables are covered at breakfast and supper time. COST OF MATERIALS. It is impossible to give any idea of what housebuilding materials and labour costs, so as to be correct in all districts, as the price of labour and lumber varies somewhat \u2014 but more particularly the latter \u2014 in different localities. The emigrant who has plenty of trees on his property has no need to purchase any. If he wishes to build his house of deals, he has only to send his logs to the nearest saw-mill, and have them cut up and properly planed, which does not cost much, and which, in some cases, it is cheaper to do than use whole logs, where such are valuable. The following prices are what such articles and labour cost in New York. Where the expense is greater or less, allowance must be made in esti- mating co:?t of erection.
