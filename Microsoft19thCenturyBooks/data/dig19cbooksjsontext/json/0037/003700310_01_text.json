IORE than a dozen years ago, Mr. Pas- ton, of Wellfield, was in the habit of taking his little daughter Ph\u0153be in his hand to Brockcotes, where he was engaged in painting a series of pictures for the Pro tector's Gallery. One day as the child was playing beside her father, a tall stooping gentleman strolled in, and Mr. Paston immediately stopped his. work to attend to him. The circumstance took hold of Ph\u0153be's mind, for her father was not given to pay heed to visitors, and, indeed, pushed his absorption in his labours to the extent of making Mrs. Paston feel cruelly injured. VOL. I. B"], [14, "Noblesse Oblige. 2 The gentleman did not wear a velvet coat or a star on his breast, or anything fine, save a very bright ring, which flashed on his finger and dazzled Ph\u0153be as he pointed here and there at the pictures. The child was struck, and stopped her play as her father had stopped his work, remaining very quiet watching the stranger. At last he noticed her, and inquired, \"Is this hazel-eyed little woman your girl, Paston ?\" \" She is. Her mother is glad to have her in safe keeping, and she is proud to come up here with me.\" \"No doubt. So this is my little girl's god-daughter. Why she is twice as brown and stout as the other. Come with me, little one \u2014 what do they call you ? You will be a treat to Lady Dorothea, and we shall see if we cannot find something to please you in return.\" Ph\u0153be appeared anything but inclined to"], [15, "Prelude. 3 leave her father and go away alone with the grand stranger, through the labyrinth of corridors and saloons ; but her father looked so shocked at her contumacy, that the poor little thing submitted unconditionally. Lord Exmore took her chubby hand in his long fingers, and speaking to her a careless en couraging word now and then, led her, troubled and bewildered, along what ap peared to the child's imagination miles on miles of carpet, marble, and polished oak. On they went, past more pictures, rows and rows of portraits of gay ladies with whole sweet pots of flowers on their heads and bosoms \u2014 ladies with very low necks and very long curls \u2014 ladies with jeweled stoma chers and stiff ruffs \u2014 ladies in close cambrie caps, and swathed in shawls, like superannu ated babies, \u2014 and ladies studded round with babies' heads like spots on a peacock's tail. All these portraits of ladies were flanked b2"], [16, "Noblesse Oblige. 4 by portraits of gentlemen, like papa's Don Quixote\u2014 like the figure on the tomb in the church of St. Basil\u2014 like the virger of the church \u2014 like the jockeys who rode at the Wellfield races. At last, when Ph\u0153be had been dumbfounded, and nearly driven out of her small wits, Lord Exmoor opened a door into a large, light, warm saloon, and dropped her hand. It was a room no less wonderful than those they had passed through. There was a fire with a curious high fender, and before it a little white, silken-haired black-eyed dog, in a dog-basket lined with blue. There were green and red and yellow birds flying and hopping to and fro in a large cage in one of the windows ; there was a globe full of gold and silver fish ; there were screens covered with paper pictures ; there was a spotted wooden horse, like one of Lady Ex moor's piebald ponies, with a real mane and"], [17, "Prelude. 5 tail ; there was a tiny house, with the front somewhat wanting, thus laying bare dining room and drawing-room, bedrooms and kitchen, furnished with every convenience for the natives of Lilliput ; there was a glass cabinet stuffed with large and small wax dolls of both sexes, of every variety of com plexion and attire, and at every stage of doll or human life \u2014 flaxen-tressed dolls and raven-haired dolls, dolls in court dress ready to be presented to her Majesty, and dolls, setting privacy and propriety at defiance, prepared to retire to rest in the presence of other dolls in full military and naval uni form. This room was occupied by a comely elderly lady in a lace cap, a white apron over her spotless chintz calicot, and a silk shawl round her shoulders. She sat in one of the windows sewing by the aid of gold-rimmed spectacles. She rose on Lord Exmoor's en-"], [18, "Noblesse Oblige. 6 trance, and curtseying to him a little, in the style of his noble grandmother, remained waiting his commands. There was another occupant who sat still at a table in the middle of the room, and merely gave a calm little nod, uttering an abstracted \" Good-morning, papa,\" as she looked up on the first opening of the door. This was a little girl, spare and slight, with a precocious air of mingled dignity and acuteness. She was dressed in a white frock, and had her long black hair delicately di vided, and hanging down on her shoulders, in striking contrast to Ph\u0153be's short, thick, broken ringlets, little darker than a hazel nut, which were massed and crushed against her brown poppy-tinged cheeks, as they had been left by her old-fashioned bonnet. The little girl of Brockcotes was engaged over a small china dinner-service, by the help of which she was rehearsing a dinner-"], [19, "Prelude. 7 party, with great precision and decorum. She did desist immediately on the intrusion upon her company, but continued her ma n\u0153uvres of the plates and dishes, accompany ing them with little audible speeches, deliver ed in clear treble tones, at once easy and emphatic. \" Duchess, will you try the haunch of venison ?\" \" Lady Mary, I can recommend the Lafitte ;\" merely glancing the while at the intruders, from beneath her long eyelashes, with her large, limpid grey eyes, the pupil a violet black, the iris a clear, pearly grey. \"Dorothea, I have brought you a little friend ; come and speak to her,\" the Earl in terrupted his daughter. \" I beg your pardon ; presently, papa,\" Lady Dorothea excused herself, till she had dismissed her viewless company with the formal adjournment, \" Duchess, shall we go to the drawing-room?\" Then she came"], [20, "Noblesse Oblige. 8 down directly from her chair, and walked straight to Ph\u0153be and the Earl. \"Papa, you have forgotten to present us,\" she reminded him, still refraining from letting her eyes rest on Ph\u0153be. \" Is it one of the Godolphins or the Needhams ? \" naming two of the county families, without the pretence of a stage whisper. \" No ; it is Mr. Paston's little girl, to whom you stood godmother, Dolly. Of course, you don't remember it, because you were a baby yourself at the time.\" \" I do remember, papa, \u2014 I mean I have been told of it, \u2014 and shall send her a ' Christ ian Year' and a 'Child's Companion' next Easter. How do you do, Mr. Paston's little girl, my god-daughter?\" \u2014 coming close to Ph\u0153be, and looking her all over now, with bright, meditative, friendly eyes. \" Keep her with you, Dorothea. Let the"], [21, "Prelude. 9 children have a romp together, Dykes,\" di rected the Earl, turning away. \" You hear what my Lord says,\" repeated Lady Dorothea, with vivacious impressive ness. \" You are to stay with me, my little god-daughter ; and, since I need not be on ceremony with a little Wellfield girl, I may tell you that I should like you to show me how the town girls get up their dolls' wash ings. Dykes will find us tubs, lines, and irons ; only, in case Dykes hurt herself, we will not have the irons hot. Do you know, Mr. Paston's little girl, I held one to my cheek once, as I had seen Mrs. Chenevix at the Wellfield Lodge do, and I had to go in afterwards to the Countess with a blistered face ! Dykes was dreadfully vexed about it ; but little girls ought to learn everything, in case of riots and revolutions and things, and that they may not grow up shockingly ignorant, and their children's children after"], [22, "Noblesse Oblige. 10 them. Oh, I forgot, if you do not like to show me your way of doing washing or keep ing shop, \u2014 you must know how to keep shop, and I am sadly afraid I keep it all wrong,\" put in Lady Dorothea wistfully, \u2014 \"we will have cards, or dinners, or what ever you prefer, because you have come to visit me here at Brockcotes, and it is my duty to entertain you.\""], [23, "Town and Castle. 11 CHAPTER I. Town and Castle. IELLFIELD was a quiet-going, old- fashioned little town, shone upon, not shadowed by, Lord Exmoor's great seat of Brockcotes. Once upon a time it had been a mere dependency of the old castle \u2014 a cluster of thatched houses, with a square towered little church, occupied by the vassals of the Latimer family ; now it was dignified, demure, and, as a rule, too respectable to be picturesque. It accommodated a population of eight thousand, who had not preserved an olive-tinted thatch roof or an umber-brown wooden house among them all, save in holes and corners."], [24, "Noblesse Oblige. 12 Wooers' Alley was the most picturesque quarter of unpicturesque Wellfield, and was not unsuited to be the habitation of poet or painter. It was a by-way, as all your lovers' lanes and wooers' alleys are. Odd and ir regular, it still had gable ends facing the road, and presented here and there a wide gateway, with lamps like Chinese lanterns suspended between old elm and ash trees, though they led to nothing more imposing than a market-garden, a wood-yard or a laundress's green. Wooers' Alley did not limit its line to one gradient, but ascended and descended, and indulged in the sharpest angles, to the aggravation of the old and the lazy. Some of its houses looked as if they. had been built on a level with the tops of other houses, and had their pleasure-grounds parallel to their neighbours' roofs. Others again were sunk after the fashion of a well, and were contemplated over garden walls in"], [25, "Toivn and Castle. 13 hollows twenty feet below the path. Wooers' Alley was more exclusive even than those squares and terraces in London, which refuse to lend themselves to any carriages but private ones. A wheel barrow could not have undergone the inequalities and eccentricities of Wooers' Alley without risk. The most aristocratic visitors were therefore forced to come on foot, or not at all. After its. quietness, a quality which it had in common with most little towns, the dis tinguishing characteristic of Wellfield was a prevailing aristocratic flavour of Brockcotes and the Latimers. And this notwithstanding the fact that, since the passing of the great Reform Bill, the town had occasionally felt itself sufficiently independent to return another than Lord Wriothesley, the Earl's eldest son, to the Lower House, there to practise his eloquence for the Upper ; and to"], [26, "Noblesse Oblige. 14 pass by humbler scions of the house of Latimer when Lord Wriothesley happened to be a minor, or otherwise disposed of. Since the Conquest the family had not lost a grain of its social influence ; the influence had changed its character, that was all. The market-place was encumbered by a statue of the late Lord Exmoor, in a stone facsimile of the regimentals \u2014 very high at the neck and short in the waist \u2014 which he had worn when he fought for his king and country in the Peninsula. The principal en trance to the town was embellished with a fountain, guarded by four greyhounds, seat ed on their granite haunches (the sup porters of the Brockcotes' coat-of-arms), presented to the town by the reigning Coun tess when Lady Wriothesley, and called the Wriothesley Fountain. The great privilege of the town consisted in the right to provide the supplies and fur-"], [27, "Town and Castle. 15 nish the service of the Earl, and of the outer public who flocked at particular sea sons to visit Brockcotes ; while a chief part of its relaxation lay in the old use and wont of walking in Brockcotes Park, and in being entertained by the Latimers, \u2014 going through the form of entertaining them, in return, at every era of birth, marriage, or accession in their history. Brockcotes was not more than half a mile from Wellfield, though its park stretched some miles in another direction. The mass of building on the height, relieved by its great clumps of wood, was not only conspi cuous from Wellfield, but its quadrangle and portico, broken lines of roof, towers, and turrets, formed a more imposing representa tion of a town than Wellfield itself. Brock cotes was the show-place of the county, and Wellfield might well cherish a little satisfac tion in the proximity, which was both pro-"], [28, "Noblesse Oblige. 16 fitable and pleasurable to it. The Exmoor family, on their part, took a pride in keep ing up what guide-books and county histories call a baronial residence, and in commonly residing in it from autumn till Easter, in spite of the many self-sacrifices and inconveniences involved in the circumstance. One of the gates of Brockcotes \u2014 a species of undress gate in plain iron, with a porter's lodge no better than a suburban Swiss cot tage \u2014 opened at about a hundred yards dis tance from the point where the High Street of Wellfield terminated in the park wall of Brockcotes, and where the street was slant ingly cut in two by the dogmatic, brusque flight of Wooers' Alley. This gate, known as the Wellfield gate, was open to the towns people from seven in the morning till nine in the evening. Any attempt to close it would have been the most likely thing to produce a rebellion of the Wellfield lieges,-"], [29, "Town and Castle. 17 unless it were the enormity of the family's ceasing to be the staple customer of the Wellfield butchers, bakers, grocers, and linen-drapers, and having its stores supplied by contract from tradesmen in the capital, with the aid of the railway, after the fashion of the old cosmopolitan army contractor, Mr. Coke. The oldest resident could not remember a time when the Wellfield child ren were not free to run among the shadows of the leaves, play at hide-and-seek round the tree-boles, gather periwinkles and prim roses at the tree-roots, and gaze in wonder ing admiration at the fallow deer and Scotch cattle which strayed about ; when the Well field lovers could not saunter and smell the hawthorn and the roses, and listen to the nightingale ; when the old Wellfield gossips could not find shelter from sun and wind to put their nodding heads together under the boughs ; or when the careful wives and rosy vol. i. c"], [30, "Noblesse Oblige. 18 daughters of working men engaged at the castle, could not carry pitchers and covered plates to their bread-winners at breakfast and dinner hours. The Wellfield avenue had its tide, always welling more or less full, of common humanity and its kindly joys and sorrows, to temper the retirement and re pose of the great Latimers of Brockcotes. Strolling through the grounds, one came on patches of bracken, pale gold in their first sereness, and set off by the deep, clear malachite green of clumps of laurels ; on huge bushes of sycamores and great larches bending to the ground, and sweeping it with their branches. These led to the American Garden beyond, between breaks of rhodo dendrons and azaleas. As the visitor ascend ed terrace after terrace, and gazed round on the wealth of trees in the park, wide as a chase, the monotony broken by the silver sheet of the mere, covering its seven-"], [31, "Town and Castle. 19 ty acres, and on the domed and turreted kennels \u2014 a smaller Brockcotes on a rising ground \u2014 his eye then wandering far away to the fields on fields of stubble and green crop, pasture and coppice, with bountiful country houses, snug villages, and towers and spires of parish churches, all on the Brockcotes estate, he could scarce help thinking the scene the grander for anything he had witnessed elsewhere. He saw but a section of the great faqade of the castle, but that was enough. It had taken six cen turies to complete, and it represented about as many styles of English architecture. There was the Norman keep, solid, grim and slit holed, with wallflower and frogs'-mouth tufting the clefts of the massive walls which had one day bristled with cloth-yard shafts ; there were Tudor windows and clock-towers ; Inigo Jones colonnades and gateways ; Sir John Vanbrugh suites of rooms \u2014 Gibbs. c2"], [32, "20 Noblesse Oblige.

Ph\u0153be's Walk to the Castle. H\u0152BE PASTON had just returned to her father's house in Wooers' Alley. She had been away eighteen months, finishing her education with her cousins the Halls, at Folksbridge, the trading seaport in the east of the county ; and taking a flying trip to the Continent under her uncle and aunt's wing. She was now walking up to Brockcotes to report herself, and to pay her homage to her godmother and friend, Lady Dorothea, as duly and undoubtingly as if the two had lived in the Middle Ages. It is true that the Brockcotes family had a particular claim on the Pastons, \u2014 the pre-"], [34, "Noblesse Oblige. 22 sent Earl having what is significantly termed \"made\" Mr. Paston five-and-twenty years before, and having never tired of employing and backing him since. Lady Dorothea and Ph\u0153be, too, as children, had got up wash ings and dinners and shop-keepings with such zest, that the games had brought a faint colour into Lady Dorothea's thin white face ; and as a consequence, Mr. Paston's little girl was summoned over and over again to repeat the charm, until the children became regular play-fellows and attached compan ions. The association was renewed every time the family returned to Brockcotes, and continued without a break till Ph\u0153be had left to go to her cousins. The child's play had become girls' lessons and chatter, and in place of exhibiting her dolls' dresses, it had. been her confirmation-dress, and the dress thought of for her first drawing-room, which Lady Dorothea had latterly shown"], [35, "Ph\u0153be's Walk to the Castle. 23 and talked of to the sympathising Wellfield girl. Withal, the intimacy had been main tained within bounds, and conducted with discretion by the ruling powers. The intercourse had been held chiefly in the nurseries, school-rooms, gardens, and park ; or in the Pastons' house at Wooers' Alley. Ph\u0153be had not been placed in the false position of a humble companion in the Brock cotes drawing-rooms, neither had she been suffered to sink into the housekeeper s-room, though she had a well-merited respect and regard for Mrs. Bald and Miss Thorpe, the housekeeper and the Countess's maid, who shared it between them when there was no company. And when mentioning these two, not only highly respectable, but tremendous ly responsible and authoritative personages, one should not omit to add that they occasionally drank tea with Mrs. Paston at Wooers' Alley."], [36, "24 Noblesse Oblige. It had been managed by Lady Dorothea's mother and Ph\u0153be's father \u2014 alike in being eminently sensible individuals in their differ ent walks \u2014 that Ph\u0153be should keep her own place in her experience of high life. As for Lady Dorothea, it is the privilege of Lady Dorotheas that no honest company can degrade them. When they stoop, it is to confer distinction. Yet though Ph\u0153be Paston was in a spe cial sense a retainer of the Latimers, any girl in Wellfield, up to Miss Adelaide Coke, \u2014 the daughter of old Mr. Coke, the retired army agent at the White House \u2014 who was permitted to attend, not merely the ball at Brockcotes in the race week, which was open to all the town's people who could establish the most distant pretensions to being in the middle class, but the county ball, where she sometimes danced in the same quadrille with Lady Dorothea\u2014 any girl in"], [37, "Ph\u0153be's Walk to the Castle. 25 Wellfield would have been exalted in her own estimation, and in that of her neighbours, by being called upon to go up to Brockcotes and be admitted to familiar intercourse with Lady Dorothea. Ph\u0153be dispensed with no punctilio, there fore, when she entered the gateway without saying \" By your leave,\" and merely stop ped for old acquaintance-sake to exchange a greeting with the lodge-keeper, \u2014 a little cricket of an elderly woman, contrasting strongly with the deliberate, taciturn porter at the great gate. \" Going up to see Lady Dorothea, Miss Paston ? You've stepped in before without being unmannerly, as true enough, it was not like that you, a young lady and a travelled lady, would be, sew-er-ly.

This came before her now in all its ludic rousness. It was not that the Halls could not command luxuries and comparative splendours. They had been accustomed to them ; at all events, Mrs. Hall had, for she was a daughter of one of the first merchants in Folksbridge. But even if Mrs. Hall had been able to monopolize and preserve all the cedar-wood, ivory, spices, and Dutch pictures on which she delighted to expatiate, and though there had been joined to them the upholsterer's and the jeweller's glories of purple velvet, amber satin, rococo chairs and Parian marble statues, up to gold toilet plate, \u2014 what could these count weigh ed against the treasures of Brockcotes?

Ph\u0153be knew well there were things which money could not buy, far other than dancing-masters' graces and bastard Byronisms. They might be illusions, too, it is true, but they were dear next to household charities, and sacred after Divine sacraments. For what in them selves were family jewels, armour, shields, stained glass, the whole ultimata of the Ho race Walpoles, to the musty, worm-eaten, state banqueting-room where one Latimer had spent his rents for a year and a day on a loyal feast to a king in adversity ; or to the shabby business-room in which another"], [42, "30 Noblesse Oblige. Latimer had pledged lands and life to save his country and maintain the integrity of its halting but high-reaching laws ; or to the faded state bed on which had lain the coffin of a hero, resting from his last fight, with the tattered, soiled banner spread over it, which was afterwards to form the grandest relic of the old guard-room. The diamonds and Milanese mail were overborne by the cracked dels flower-pot in which a brave dame had once hidden the title-deeds of her children's inheritance from the house's enemy. Why, every step in this house led to a hoary record of history, wrought in by some member of a family which, for a score of generations, had held in trust for the people a great stake in the country. Ph\u0153be did not enter Brockcotes by the great gateway. The Earl himself did not think of doing this, except on great occa sions. It would have involved a progress"], [43, "Ph\u0153be's Walk to the Castle. 31 through the guard-room, the armoury, the old hall, the Elizabethan saloon, the white drawing-room, with the Queen Anne closet, and the great picture gallery, before the inhabited quarters of the house could have been reached. Ph\u0153be had made the round with unflagging interest many a time, and hoped to make it again in triumph with her cousins ; but it would take half a day. For the needs of private and ordinary intercourse there were side doors in every direction, which the family had learnt to use as they had learnt to occupy graciously a house which was not theirs alone but the country's \u2014 liable to be invaded three days a week, in all its ancient and splendid localities, by a hydra-headed, gaping, fingering, enthu siastic monster, whose convenience they had to consult, and who was mortally jeal ous of so much as a terrace, a- garden, a row of windows, a suite of rooms kept"], [44, "Noblesse Oblige. 32 back from it and retained for private ends.

Altogether this simple sprig of the servants' hall of Brockcotes was a mightily different specimen of the genus plush from the dreadful boy in buttons whom Ph\u0153be's aunt Hall affected; or even from the men hired to wait at parties at Garnet Lodge, who got drunk, broke the diamond cut frosted water jug, and were so intolera bly saucy and insolent to Olive Hall when she corrected them, that she had to call upon her brother Frank to order them out of the house. r> VOL.

I don't count scientific, antiquarian, clerical or social economic letters under the same head.

You know I shall contrive to get rid of my share of the family correspond ence by economising my te a and toilet, or by coming up here after dinner, if mamma can spare me, or, should all other resources fail, by tearing the letters into little bits, and flinging them out of the window, with the world none the poorer, or myself a bit peni tent.\" \" I don't believe that,\" asserted Ph\u0153be ; \" you never treated my letters so, and in stead of your not thinking of such havoc, I don't know who would mind it more.\""], [51, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 39 \"Ah ! you always thought a great deal bet ter of me than I deserved.

You must take luncheon with us, and pay your re spects to the Countess. Of course that is settled.\" Lady Dorothea's room adjoined the south ern nurseries, where Ph\u0153be and she had first met. Ph\u0153be was sure that Lady Doro thea would not have vacated it for another, or changed any of its salient features. It was not the fashion at Brockcotes for the inhabitants to flit from perch to perch, or to dismantle and refurnish their nests. There was the strongest element of conservatism in the great house.

The boudoir was decidedly plain, spacious, and wonderfully convenient. The pale French-gray walls were without relief of watered paper or gilt cornicing ; and all the adornment they had was from some chalk drawings and water-colour sketches of Lady- Dorothea's \u2014 not always in the best perspec tive, nor with the most perfect touch \u2014 and photographs of members of the family and the household, including favourite horses and dogs. The carpet was Turkey indeed, but it was worn thread-bare, and the cheval mirror was encased in an out-of-date, tarnish ed, black and gold frame. The wood was maple, the hangings chintz, the porcelain"], [53, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 41 common white and gilt-edged china. The aristocratic element lay in the ample provi sion for every possible requirement of the occupant. The toilet service was full, though it was not of silver or silver gilt, but of 4 tortoise-shell and alabaster. There was a reading-table, a writing-table, a portable book-case, a flower stand, a cabinet, a desk, a work-basket, a night lamp, a day lamp, and chairs, couches, and footstools for all the phases of industry and idleness, notwithstand ing the principal lounge had no more ex pensive cover than white dimity. Suppos ing Brockcotes subjected to a siege, Lady Dorothea's room would have afforded her occupation and entertainment during every month of the twelve. The bedroom beyond, with the door ajar, was even less costly, in its light iron bed stead, serviceable chests of drawers and wardrobes, with only the delicacy of its"], [54, "Noblesse Oblige. 42 linen, its complete provision for warmth in winter and air at all times, and the enamel tiles of its lavatory, to distinguish it from any ordinary unpretending bedroom of the upper class. But there was one detail un attainable, save in such quarters ; the win dows belonging to these rooms commanded three separate vistas of the park, each of them a long sylvan alley, with its striking suggestive termination \u2014 the first being the great gate ; the second, the Brockcotes' obe lisk, raised to commemorate slave emancipa tion, in which the Latimers of Brockcotes had played their part ; and the third, the group of Scotch firs, planted as a record of the family of Countess Jean \u2014 a waving tree for each weeping baby that had grown into a man or a woman, and was now dead and mouldering into dust within the walls of the Brockcotes' mausoleum, or in strange lands, or in the depths of the sea."], [55, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 43 Lady Dorothea was as far removed from extravagance in dress as her rooms were from extravagance in furniture. There was no such distinction now between the morning dresses of the friends as there had been between those of little Lady Dorothea and Mr. Paston's little girl. Lady Dorothea's cambric muslin was hardly finer than Ph\u0153be's : and although hers was freshly put on for the morning, and Ph\u0153be's for the week, that of the ar ristocratic lady, because less care was called for perhaps, was the more crumpled and flecked of the two. Another change in their personal attributes was that Lady Dorothea was at the present moment the more tanned and freckled of the two, with those small, clear, dark freckles, like spots on the lip of a shell, which only come out on very fine skins. Mr. Finlay, the Scotch gardener, and his subordinates, could have given a reason. Lady Dorothea had a passion for working"], [56, "Noblesse Oblige. 44 in the greenhouses with her own hands, and when it was hot there, unless the opinion of the Countess occurred to her, she would throw off her hat and gloves without the least concern for her complexion ; besides, she had taken Lord Wriothesley's dogs under her special care during his absence, and the kennels were at a quarter of a mile's dis tance from house, in the most exposed situation as to sun and wind in the park. In addition still, Lady Dorothea rode with the Earl, as well as drove with the Countess, and did an amazing amount of family, poor, and parish work at odd times on the estate. Except one hour before luncheon, and an other before dinner, when she read and wrote in her own room, she was good to be found somewhere or other out of doors all through the spring and autumn days. Indeed, she was half as much time in the open air as a field- worker, and ten times as much as a"], [57, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 45 home-staying, embroidering, house-keeping young lady in the rank of Ph\u0153be Paston. As to Lady Dorothea's head, the fine hair of which had been so treasured and cultivat ed by nurse and maid, she would, in her perfectly cultivated womanhood, as soon have thought of coming down to the break fast-room with a diamond coronet on her temples, or a wreath of artificial flowers and flower-sprays hanging down her back, as have descended to her world showing anything but the quietest little mouse-black head, its natural ornament disposed of, in these days of chignons, in some mysteriously simple manner. She left frizzling, plaiting, bandeauing, and rosetting, to her Abigail, \"Thorpie,\"the Countess's maid, and Thorpie's coquettish little niece. Lady Dorothea was slight, pale, and under the middle size, as ever ; and the first impression made by her on a stranger might"], [58, "46 Noblesse Oblige. be one of momentary disappointment that \" the daughter of a hundred earls \" should appear a trifle insignificant. It required a second look and a second thought to appre ciate the fineness of the traits, of the very contrast between the dark hair and the natu rally satin-white skin ; to discover how pure, subtle, and tender \u2014 in the French sense \u2014 would be the blush of rose which animation or emotion would call into the cheek. Once sensible of the true beauty of a high-born woman, and there is an inclination to regard every other style of beauty as coarse and clumsy in comparison ; yet Lady Dorothea, thanks to her open-air life and active, well balanced mind, was not intrinsically fragile, hectic, or softly weak-looking. There were in her carriage and gestures the nerve and elasticity of both health and breeding, to carry her, if necessary, over mountains of tribulation and seas of difficulties. In place"], [59, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 47 of being languid or statuesque, her face was espiegle and mobile to a fault \u2014 open, indeed, to the charge of never being seen in a state of repose. Ph\u0153be Paston was lithely round, and several inches taller than Lady Dorothea. She was in face softly brown, with a warm, not a swarthy brownness, answering to eyes having an olive tint in their hazel irises, and a blue ness in the white of their balls. Dimples came and went in her cheeks ; and her mouth, a little too full, preserved an archness and capacity for expanding into a rich straight line of intent enthusiasm or sobriety, which altogether redeemed it. It was saying a good deal for Ph\u0153be Paston's face and figure that they could bear to be looked at beside Lady Dorothea's fine black and white traits \u2014 beside the thin nostril, the flexible mouth, with the transparent teeth glancing through the perpetually varying curves, the"], [60, "Noblesse Oblige. 48 arched neck and arched foot. What was most amiss in Ph\u0153be was, that she wore her hair German fashion, so that the wave and ripple back from the low, square forehead, ap peared something smart beside Lady Doro thea's smooth little morning head, the shape of a greyhound's; and that her hands \u2014 though she had no passion for working in green-houses, no obligation to feed dogs, and was particular in wearing gloves when she tied up her roses and carnations \u2014 were one or two degrees larger, and of heavier mould and material, than Lady Dorothea's. Of course Ph\u0153be exaggerated the defect, and called her hands bear's paws and mason's mallets beside those of her Ladyship, and thus escaped all conceit where those mem bers were concerned. Lady Dorothea marshalled Ph\u0153be to one of the window seats, and they sat down together, like Hermia and Helena, \" both"], [61, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 49 on one cushion,\" and commenced a brisk fire of questions. \" First, about the cousins at Folksbridge, whom you knew so little of, and have lived a year and a half with \u2014 are they nice people?\" \" Very nice, and two of them so clever,\" replied Ph\u0153be, promptly. \u25a0 \" I know one is the only son \u2014 the journal ist in town \u2014 whom Wriothesley met on the Danube, swore a friendship to, and praises up to the skies. But you are not going to marry him, as I once predicted ?\" \" No, indeed,\" Ph\u0153be negatived decis ively, with a laugh indicative of the clear est of consciences, and without a shade of a blush. \" That would never do.

I suppose he cannot help what constitutes him a sort of puritan vagabond. It is the old Danish pirate in his blood rising against the other element of the Dutch shopkeeper.\" Ph\u0153be said not a word in reply to Lady Dorothea's particular definition of her taste, and ignored any special allusions it con tained, while her cheeks were tingling with provocation under it, and with dread lest she had not heard the last of this. No more came just then. Lady Doro thea went off to something very different. \" Are your cousins very fond of garnets, Ph\u0153be, that they call their house Garnet Lodge ?\" \" I fancy they would prefer rubies,\" cor- E 2"], [64, "Noblesse Oblige. 52 rected Ph\u0153be, the least bit in the world of fended. \" They did not christen the place, it was named by the former owner.\" \" Oh ! then they are not responsible for the name,\" admitted Lady Dorothea, taking pains to make amends for her indiscretion. \"And that is one advantage of stepping into strangers' shoes.

Swine are very well in their own way, but why have to drag them into one's mouth twenty times a day when we are in Dorsetshire ? And what did you think of foreign lands, you little Wellfield native?

At what points on your route did you stay longest, and what places did you admire most ?\" It had still been the grand tour to Ph\u0153be, perfect in its six weeks shortness ; and she had seen everything with such vivid percep tion and lively appreciation, that she had not time to tell Lady Dorothea one half of what her ladyship would have liked to have heard, as she sat listening, with her keen analytical faculty, and the half pensive weight of experience, looking out of her bright, pellucid eyes, and playing about her trans parent face. In Ph\u0153be's description, one place chased"], [66, "Noblesse Oblige. 54 another. Every now and then she called herself back with an \" Oh !

I am glad you had such a holiday. So you stopped at that little place beyond Coblentz. You were more fortunate than we were. We wanted to ' do it,' but we could not manage this, for we could not find accommodation for our party. We were once driven out of Lausanne for the same reason. You wouldn't believe, Ph\u0153be, the trouble and the heart-burning that difficulty often occasioned.

He and his sisters are coming here to meet Wriothesley on his return for the race week. It is such a comfort that we are to have Wriothesley home at last,\" continued Lady Dorothea, taking up the present theme grate fully, though she had not flinched from the other. \"We expected nothing less than that he would be off to the Rocky Moun tains, where we could not spare him, because he is the only son we have ; besides, that is"], [69, "Lady Dorothea's Boudoir. 57 not exactly the way in which we want Wriothesley to distinguish himself.\" \" I heard something from Frank Hall of Lord Wriothesley having taken honours at Oxford,\" put in Ph\u0153be. \" I was not sur prised to hear it.\" \"Yes; but I don't know that a peer is entitled to take away so much Latin and Greek from his college. I don't know that it is not a mistake \u2014 that a more moderate quantity might not serve his turn.

We think no harm of that, when we can afford it ; but the Latimers have always confined their taste in this matter to the Wellfield race week, and left the larger doings to the Grevilles. Besides, Wriothesley has no bent in this direction.

He had thin dark hair, which, both on his head and his cheeks, looked as if it had not stamina enough in it to undergo a change to iron grey, but would \"wede away \" with years.

It was an inquisitive, rather than an intellectual face \u2014 kindly, somewhat sensu ous, yet not without elements of mingled weakness and stubbornness in it. And his figure was by no means commanding. In deed, had the face or the figure belonged to an ordinary man \u2014 had not both had legibly written on them, \"I am Charles Aubrey Latimer, Earl of Exmoor, gifted with great territorial sway for good or evil, capable of mending or marring, in some degree, the well-being and happiness of thousands of my fellow-creatures,\" he would not have stood"], [85, "The Latimer Family. 73 conspicuously out from the multitude. As it was, the consciousness of his position, with the culture of birth and breeding, gave an air of ease and power to the good-natured, well-disposed nobleman, which sat not un gracefully upon him. But Lady Dorothea had not spoken of the family history without her host. Lord Ex moor had been content to stand in the first rank of country gentleman, because he had not felt himself qualified for anything greater. The Latimers, like the Grosvenors, the Fitzwilliams, and the domestic branch of the Spensers (according to recent autho rity), had been, upon the whole, notably virtuous, while they had fallen far short of the scornful magnificence of the Caven dishes, the killing wit of the Stanhopes, and the industry and aplomb of the Russells.

It was a greater relief than Ph\u0153be could have imagined when the gong sounded for luncheon, and she had to go with Lady Do rothea to the Countess, certain that the lat ter would not assail her with Barty Wooler. The Countess was the unpopular member of the Exmoor family. She had been an heiress \u2014 the Latimers having married heir esses, more or less, for centuries. It was a provision made incumbent on them by their hereditary liberality, which was not lavish-"], [91, "The Latimer Family. 79 ness, because there was no prodigality in their blood. But the Latimers had a tra ditional mode of doing business, which was rather peculiar to them. They were not prodigal, but open-handed \u2014 an expensive characteristic, perhaps more so than the other, when there is a rebound to miserli ness every now and then as a stop-gap. At the same time, there had been no corre sponding largeness of sagacity and enterprise in opening up new sources of wealth. The family had not been statesmen accumulating uncounted treasure by their venality ; nor had they grown richer and richer by allow ing wealth to have its outlet in trade, in addition to breadth of territory or length of pedigree. The Latimers, not showing these faculties, had no resource but to marry heiresses. It was from the Countess that Lady Do rothea and Lord Wriothesley inherited their"], [92, "Noblesse Oblige. 80 low stature. The Earl was only inclined to be weak and shaky on the legs, and, when he did not hold himself upright, to be shambling in his gait. The Countess was a withered little woman of middle age, look ing as if she might have been put away in a bandbox, although when she was in high dress she made good her right to wear the renowned Exmoor necklace of brilliants. She was naturally reserved, and her de fective hearing rendered her still quieter. The Wellfield people had a theory that she was inordinately proud. Though Ph\u0153be had gone to Brockcotes from her childhood, she could not say anything for or against the theory. All that she was sure of was, that the Countess had an unfortunate and unenviable power of holding people who did not belong to her immediate family cir cle at arm's length \u2014 dangling them, as it were, by the very tips of the fingers, and"], [93, "The Latimer Family. 81 contriving to pour upon them at the same time, quite unintentionally, a depressing shower of cold water.

But she could not get over feeling stiff, stupid, and uncomfort- able in the Countess's company. On the other hand, and as if to compensate for the public slight, Lady Exmoor's family were excessively attached to her, and owned her influence to an overweening extent. Such men as the Earl are good husbands, both from principle and inclination ; but he con- sulted the Countess constantly, and adopted her views before those of any other person, even of the cherished son and heir, who had a vested interest in his father's more impor tant undertakings.

Ph\u0153be found the Countess engaged in needlework. Lady Exmoor, besides a talent for silence, had a talent for embroidery, which, with its demands on patient applica tion and elaborate design and execution, is out of keeping with a hurrying, distraught age. She had taken up as a congenial task what Lady Dorothea was tempted to com pare to weaving ropes of sand \u2014 the great Exmoor Countess's drawing-room hangings, which had been in process from the date of the South-Sea scheme.

Lady Dorothea thanked her stars that she would never be Countess of Ex moor, to be forced to put her hand to the work, and drop it wearily, unfinished, to her successor. Ph\u0153be had associated these shroud-like folds of silk and unfading flow ers with the Countess ever since she was first introduced to the great lady's presence; and although she had seen the Gobelin ta pestry and the achievements of Flemish wea vers in the interval, she continued to respect the Countess's hangings almost as much as the peeress's coronet which Lady Exmoor had worn when she walked at the Queen's coronation. Yet Ph\u0153be no more expected to witness the Countess's hangings finished and in common use, than she expected to see the Countess in her coronet and neck- g 2"], [96, "Noblesse Oblige. 84 lace driving her ponies along the streets of Wellfield. Lady Exmoor greeted Ph\u0153be willingly, but with an effort, which made itself so felt as to render it difficult for Ph\u0153be to reply to her. Her ladyship invited Ph\u0153be to accompany the party to luncheon with a still greater effort, and saw that the girl was made comfortable with such a crowning effort, that it became a great trial for Ph\u0153be to swallow a morsel. Indeed, it was a mar vel to her that Lord Exmoor and Lady Do rothea could eat their mutton and chicken, asparagus, Stilton cheese, and Queen Claudes, and drink their Madeira and milk, with so much equanimity.

It was a sorry end to the pleasant days of her first inter course with the artist in Folksbridge. But there is many a sorry end to a fair beginning, as Ph\u0153be ruefully realized when the tangle of her maiden meditation refused to be dissi pated even by the sight of the fallow deer \u2014 attractive and graceful beyond comparison to those who do not know the wild, startled nobility of the antlered heads of the red deer, as they look out of the mist on the"], [98, "Noblesse Oblige. 86 mountain sides, and show themselves for a moment before their fleet hoofs spurn the heather."], [99, "Barty Wooler makes a Suggestion. 87 CHAPTER V.

Yet he was stout of limb and fair of face \u2014 full of"], [100, "88 Noblesse Oblige. healthy, hardy philosophy and good-humour. There was no womanish intolerance about him, although, when driven to express him self in Dr. Johnson's \"Well, no, sir,\" he would set a face of iron to his opponents. \" Pure in body, and noble in soul,\" yet he had that peculiar restiveness and restlessness of temper by which the best-conditioned Saxon may be capable of shewing his descent from the Sea Dogs. \" And why should I have that poor, fret ting creature, and her fine stuck-up miss of a daughter in my house at this time of day, son Barty ? They haven't asked my price all these years, and we owe them nothing. And what has come over Caleb Paston that he cannot go out?

It was \" like son, like mother,\" in their case. Only, the strong will and racy tongue, which had enabled Judith Clay, the yeo man's daughter, to captivate Clerk Wooler, the delicate curate, were traits which in the son had been refined and mellowed by edu cation and contact with the world. The mother was left unmistakably the yeoman's daughter still ; while the son, with his father's \u00e6sthetic bent grafted on his mother's vigor ous constitution, was as unmistakably a pro fessional man and a gentleman. \" Perhaps because I don't care to bear malice, mother,\" Barty replied to his mo ther's first question, as he pulled his reddish beard. \" You haven't borne malice, Barty Wool er; you've shown that plain enough, and"], [102, "Noblesse Oblige. 90 long enough, already ; and if ever there was a dirty dog's trick \" \" Hush, say no more about it, mother,\" Barty interrupted her hastily. \" You never mentioned the affair to any one in Well field ?\" he added, in a more anxious tone. \" Now, did you, mother ?

Little good that would do. I knew a trick worth two of it.

So far he had vindi cated a man's provoking sense of cool supe riority and command of temper.

It was separated from the street by a mouldy paved court, which was fenced by a low wall, parapet, and railing, and ornamented with a single row of dropsical, mildewed laburnums. In an artist's inspi ration, Barty had improved matters by a free importation of common ferns, which lent to the cellar-like court the cool depths of green and luxuriance of vegetation that belong to the neighbourhood of a woodland spring. Even a pleasant irregular innova tion of this kind Mrs. Wooler would not have tolerated from any hand less privileged than her son's.

This she did at first by heroic motherly struggles for the child Barty's sake. To occupy a house capped and crowned even with a row of dwindling, pining trees, formed an important item in settling the scale of social rank at Wellfield. In other respects the trees were of no ac count to anybody, either in the way of beauty or of use. They only flowered in a sickly, straw-coloured fashion. They served as a noted resort for wasps in early autumn, while their poor leaves did not afford Mrs. Wooler a shelter from the profance gaze of the vulgar.

But her little infirmity did not impair the zest with which Mrs. Wooler pursued the sole excitement of her life. This was look ing out for, catching in the act, and con demning to summary chastisement, the street boys who chalked her wall with offensive caricatures of \" pleecemen \" and Mother Hubbards, or flung up their caps among her scanty boughs ; or, resting their message baskets on her parapet, swung upon her railings.

But she had grand ideas of discipline ; the daughter of a race of yeomen, she had as mortal a hatred to trespassers as ever was exhibited by the lords of the manor whose acres her father had tilled. The laburnums and the court, moreover, had all along been part of Mrs. Wooler's credentials. Having obtained these, she was minded not to part with them, but to hand them down intact to her child, not withstanding that all the privilege which they had secured for her had been admit tance to the border-land of the better so ciety of Wellfield. She could not do more than keep her own in the earlier days of her possession, and she had been obliged for a period of years to eke out her means by having the successors of Mr. Wooler as lodgers, and by working for her uncles, the"], [118, "Noblesse Oblige. 106 great linendrapers in Folksbridge. Then she was relieved from the support of Barty, and received assistance from him, instead of giving it to him. At last, the old bachelor brothers Clay came round, after having been twice so deeply offended as to with draw their favour \u2014 first, by the marriage of their blooming niece Judith to the sickly, scholarly curate ; and again, by Barty Wooler's taking it upon him to make his own choice of a profession, and fixing on what was wont to be considered the un thrifty, poverty-stricken profession of an artist. The valuable recipe for bringing about such a desirable result was simple, and might be often used effectually if heirs expectant like the Woolers could but follow it in its grand simplicity. The Clays saw that the Woolers went their own way, and,"], [119, "Barty Wooler makes a Suggestion. 107 without the Clays' favour, were strong to stint or to starve themselves. So the rich uncles grew ashamed of their own tyranny, and learned to feel some respect for their next of kin. At the same time, the pro gress of art among the great middle classes was beginning to be felt. The wealthy old men, influenced by the common tendency, began to take a little pride in their grand nephew's gracious gift \u2014 in his travels, com missions, and achievements. Indeed, they felt more pride than his mother, for she pressed her lips together, and could not bring herself to think or to say that her son's work was equal to his neighbour's. Thus it came about that the Clays, repre sentatives of a firm which had existed for three quarters of a century, and which, during the last half year, had turned over capital to the amount of five hundred thou-"], [120, "108 Noblesse Oblige. sand pounds sterling, openly acknowledged and entered into particular arrangements with Barty Wooler as their heir."], [121, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 109 CHAPTER VI. Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. IT was a characteristic of Mrs. Wooler, that having once made up her mind, she never lost time. So she at once made her way to Wooers' Alley. Nor did she fail in her overture, which was accepted, with only the affectation of a demur from Mrs. Paston. Men and women are constantly finding themselves on the verge of situations which they never expected to fill. To the helpless chagrin of Ph\u0153be, she saw that she would have to make her first appearance with her mother at an evening party, in the laburnum-"], [122, "Noblesse Oblige. 110 supported house in the High Street, to the edification of the Wellfield world. Mrs. Wooler and her maid-servant, Becky, were engaged all the day in preparing for the party. The event was improved by the in auguration of a thorough cleansing of the house, from garret to cellar, lt is doubtful whether this was done with a grim intention of making Barty pay a small instalment of the price of his folly, or as a practical ex ample to Becky of the duty of avoiding whited sepulchres \u2014 a text on which Mrs. Wooler was prone to hold forth. As she finished the new bag for the onions in the back kitchen, and as Becky completed the scouring beneath her bed, Mrs. Wooler ex cused herself for any irrelevancy in her pre sent preparations, by observing, that nobody could tell what might happen. Thus she escaped all leisure for fretting, if she ever fretted over what was inevitable."], [123, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. Ill As for Becky, who was cast in a softer mould than her mistress, and could have prized a few minutes' leisure, she had, simul taneously with the first ring of the bell, to shake herself into her company gown with a gulp of haste, and to poise her cap behind her ears, her face glowing and shining from ex ercise and brown soap, in place of enjoying the doubtful liberty of sighing over her con fiscated finery of glass ear-drops and im mense crinoline. Notwithstanding Mrs. Wooler's extensive preparations, nothing was done for partial effect. To Barty's relief, the two parlours remained in the state in which they always were. There was hardly a distinguishing mark between the two, unless the distinction of colour which marked off the Vicar of Wakefield's blue bed from his brown. There was nothing positive to indicate dining-room or drawing-room \u2014 neither in side-board nor"], [124, "112 Noblesse Oblige. lounging-chair, nor in the absence or the presence of ornament. The most definite marks were Mrs. Wooler's utilitarian work table, and an equally heavy, unpretending bow-pot, filled with a pot-pourri of rose leaves and lavender, smelling more of the fruit of cloves than of flower blossom. Even the terms \"best\" and \"worst\" became vague where everything was well preserved alike. Mrs. Wooler's rooms resembled the old stage of the old theatre, where the character and the interest of each scene were to be derived from the occupants and their intercourse, the players and their play. Ph\u0153be, in spite of her prejudice, gave a kind of consent to this austerity of detail, on account of the unities being preserved. She was sensible that there was a greater like ness between it and the stately propriety and unconsciousness of Brockcotes, than could be detected between the chambers of the"], [125, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 113 Castle and the theatrical artisticness of the painter's house in Wooers' Alley, or the heap of elegant but incongruous surround ings at Garnet Lodge. She was aware of a harmony not displeasing to the eye in the primitive, unpretending baldness of Mrs. Wooler's parlour. She felt it was like the bareness of an upland which caps the sky. But Ph\u0153be's perception was little better than a truthful instinct. There was not enough noblesse oblige in her class to enable her to get over the disadvantage of being the Woolers' guest against her will. She knew that it would be a breach of fair con ventionality to behave otherwise than what her mother called \"prettily\" to her enemy in her enemy's own house. Beyond that trifle she contributed nothing which she could help to what should have been life in its higher and purer dramatic element in the Woolers' unsophisticated sitting-room. I VOL.

It need not be wondered at, then, that no sooner had she passed between the labur nums, crossed the flags of the court and the threshold, been welcomed by Mrs. Wooler with stern courtesy, and by her son with what was in the circumstances quite com prehensible, but quite delicate cordiality, than Barty saw that he had taken another false step in dragging Ph\u0153be to the house which owned him as master. But though Barty was notably rash and blundering, he had one superiority from his years. He was not tempted to throw up his chances for one false step more or less ; he was rather inclined to contest his chances inch by inch, and make the best or the worst of them. Ph\u0153be behaved prettily, yet she was any body but herself, as she sat there nailed to her mother's side, mincing her words, as his mother had said she did. In such a position,"], [127, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 115 Mrs. Wooler, in her day, would have been either stonily silent or outrageously saucy. Mrs. Paston at her marriage had been a very pretty woman, as an artist's bride is given to be. She had not been brown, like Ph\u0153be, but golden-haired, with hyacinth blue eyes and apple-blossom cheeks. But her beauty had not worn well. Her eyes had waxed weak, her maiden blush had be come what painters term \" streaky,\" and her golden hair was now wonderfully like an orange wig under her blonde head-dress. After Mr. Paston had ceased to attire her as a lay figure, and to tell her what she ought to wear, she had adopted the utmost insipidi ty in the style of her dress. Now that Ph\u0153be was grown up, Mrs. Paston had a daughter's taste and conscience to appeal to ; but she complained, inconsistently enough, that Ph\u0153be had a mind of her own on these points. Mrs. Paston sat there with her cap i2"], [128, "Noblesse Oblige. 116 fallen back from her out-of-date orange head, and with her tintless, shapeless, yet hand some gown dropping down about her flat body. But she did not look more out of place beside the strong, rasping life of Mrs. Wooler in her thick black silk gown with its old-fashioned folds, than did Ph\u0153be in her girlish labyrinth of pique and nervous affec tation. Nor did Ph\u0153be present a less broad con trast to four out of the eight Miss Medlars who were present in exuberant health and spirits. The Miss Medlars were the daugh ters of the first attorney in Wellfield. They were all grown up, and all ready to marry. But not one of them had so much as entered on the necessary preliminary of being courted. The low and vulgar Wellfield wags had multiplied the number of the Miss Medlars to forty, \u2014 \" the forty Miss Medlars ;\" then, by a natural wicked association, they had"], [129, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 117 changed the Miss Medlars into thieves \u2014 \" the forty thieves,\" innocent though they were of stealing men's hearts. They were tall, stout, passably good-looking girls. Their bane was plethora in constitution as well as in number. Few men could serenely contem plate a wife of eleven-stone weight anymore than thirty-nine sisters-in-law. The Miss Medlars had this evening armed themselves for conquest. They came in white grena dines, with blue Swiss bands, and very short sleeves, which the)T filled to overflowing as some children do. Like children, too, their massive white arms and hands showed only dimples where, in a less generous formation, bones would have been. They had huge chignons of abundant hair \u2014 a ruddier bronze in hue than Barty Wooler's. Besides so much warmth of colour, Ph\u0153be Paston's hair took an olive hue like her eyes. Whether or not it was because Barty had"], [130, "118 Noblesse Oblige. never shown the slightest inclination towards any one of the forty, Mrs. Wooler maintained to herself that she would have been better pleased if he had sought to marry the whole forty open, dashing girls, than cast sheep's eyes on a demure, deceitful minx like Ph\u0153be Paston. Mrs. Wooler was somewhat less partial to the two Miss Staceys, whom she called, in her old expressive vernacular, \" dawlish young madams.\" Not that they were not affable. They were only too affable for the daughters of a retired Folksbridge merchant, who had further refined his family by re tiring from the world altogether, and leav ing to a widow and co-heiresses a modest amount of fortune. This was happily suf ficient to allow them to play at being coun try gentry in a fancy cottage of Exwood, about half a mile from Wellfield, where they kept a one-horse chaise, and hired, for min-"], [131, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 119 gled protection and service, one man-ser vant in addition to their maid-servants. This man-servant was a sort of Jehu and Adam in one, and it was principally in right of the one-horse chaise and the Jehu Adam, that the two Miss Staceys had arrived at the dis tinction of meeting Miss Adelaide Coke on such occasions as choral practising, and sew ing mornings at the Rectory, just as Miss Adelaide Coke met Lady Dorothea at county balls. The Miss Staceys were maypoles of girls, with everything about them elongated, even to their faces and hands, \u2014 involving such tenuity that it reminded Barty Wooler of the uniform trait of the Virgin's figure in the Byzantine pictures, and the far from exhilarating impression of imbecility it con veyed. Miss Rowe, the only remaining lady, was \" a well-connected person,\" as she would"], [132, "Noblesse Oblige. 120 have specially insisted on describing herself. She had had a brother a major in the army, and an uncle a commodore in the navy. She was past the age of probable conquests, past the age even of forlorn hopes directed against the elderly bald-headed widower, Mr. Mossman, who kept Barty Wooler in countenance, the only other man among so many women. But though past schemes and disappointments, Miss Rowe was not past parties. She was in that happy, tranquil St. Martin's summer, when an invitation meant an unmistakable opportunity to wear her moire, her rings and brooches. One of these last was a minute ship spun in filigree ; another a small model of a cannon. She wore an elaborate head-dress of feathers, flowers, and family lace. Her highest plea sure was to sit in a warm, well-lit room, with the covers off the furniture, and to eat and drink all the delicacies of the season ;"], [133, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 121 play a few rubbers of good, serious whist ; and receive and impart the most whetting scandals going in the neighbourhood. At Miss Rowe's age there was no disturbing chance of important consequences lurking behind an invitation, unless indeed it might be the risk of catching cold, and Miss Rowe could take precautions in wraps. She had reached the period of life when bosom friends are generally interpreted by tangible tough pieces of knitted wool, and when a prudence cap, an old velvet bonnet, and a thick veil, are more in request for an even ing walk, than an airy cashmere hood in the loveliest moonlight. Mrs. Wooler had some genuine respect and regard for Miss Rowe, but there was still a rivalry of ancient standing between the two, which had begun in the early pre ference of Clerk Wooler for Judith Clay. The weapons of the strife were, on the one"], [134, "122 Noblesse Oblige. hand, rigid yeoman principles, and great trade expectations ; and on the other, com parative laxity of tone, and superior birth and breeding. In moments of provocation, Mrs. Wooler, who relished Miss Rowe's society well enough, was yet guilty of speak ing of her to Barty as another Jezebel and Delilah up in years. Gentlemen were not, like ladies, to be picked up on a moment's notice at Well field. Married men thought they discharged their duty fully, when they did the honours of their own houses. Young men, eligi ble partners either for an evening or for life, were so scarce that not more than one could be expected to appear, and he was made much of on an ordinary occasion. It is not surprising, then, that Mrs. Wooler had been able to do no more than procure Mr. Mossman, the mildest, most inoffen sive specimen of his kind. During his late"], [135, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 123 wife's lifetime he had depended on her for tune, and had found his chief employment in escorting her, and carrying her basket with her head-dress when she went out to tea. Perhaps it was because of this that he had inherited, along with his widower's an nuity, a free pass to all such parties. From long practice he was as well qualified to speak on the markets, the prospects of gar dens, the health of children, the moral con dition of servants, as any lady in the land. The ladies called him a great acquisition ; but the men groaned over him. Widow and maiden atoned to him, however, by chirping and twittering round him with an tique airs and palpitations and subdued jealousies. Mrs. Wooler and Miss Rowe were two exceptions \u2014 merely tolerating their admirer ; for in the perversity of man kind, or in the fate which continued to pit the ancient women against each other, they"], [136, "124 Noblesse Oblige. were the forbidden fruit after which Mr. Mossman had a meek hankering. There was an absence of the Church ele ment at Mrs. Wooler's party. This, how ever, was not from any disrespect entertained by Mrs. Wooler towards the clergy. She had been brought up in the faith of Church and State. She had a lofty veneration for the very boards of her prayer-book, and a tenderness half fond, half fierce, for the cloth to which Clerk Wooler had belonged. But, to tell the truth, there was, owing to various causes, an absence of the Church element, not to say of Christianity, in those walks of Wellfield society which did not in clude the dissenting interest. The Vicar of St. Basil's \u2014 a distant connexion of the Ex moor family \u2014 was an old bachelor, aristo cratic, learned, and dry, who insisted on performing the duties of his parish himself, without the aid of a curate, except when he"], [137, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 125 made use of Lady Dorothea. The Rector of St. Mary's was elderly, as well as dull witted in his conscientiousness \u2014 a man who employed slow, drudging curates, like him self, and whose childless wife was a bond fide invalid. There was not even a feud between St. Basil's and St. Mary's Among the resolutely cheerful guests, Ph\u0153be sat with her black dog on her back, irreconcilably hostile. She was intensely conscious of the fact that the Medlars and the Staceys were watching every tittle of her intercourse with Barty Wooler. She knew that the interest of a rumoured marriage be tween her and Barty afforded their neigh bours an absorbing study, with the added zest arising from disparity of years, as well as from great prospects on the one side, and all the coyness and reluctance of a spoilt girl on the other. Such lively speculations, in the midst of the envy they could not fail to"], [138, "Noblesse Oblige. 126 excite, were a priceless treasure in the stag nation of Wellfield. Miss Rowe would pop them newly gathered into her scandal-bag, and make two or three additional cosy par ties out of them. Had Ph\u0153be been of a temper and an age for bland philosophy, this reflection ought to have consoled her, but it did not. Barty Wooler had cause lessly brought upon her such mortification and confusion of face, that she felt she could not stop till she hated him. Mrs. Wooler, as she sat behind her tea urn, took in the spectacle with a shade of ironical satisfaction. She had warned Barty, and he would not listen. See what came of it. Here was the pert, boarding-school miss, Caleb Paston's daughter, turning up her fine nose, if not even losing her head, at this misplaced homage of her betters, whom she ought to serve humbly with all"], [139, "Mrs. Wooler receives her Guests. 127 she has. Mrs. Wooler had a strong senti ment of justice, and a supreme faith in her own instincts, which greatly helped her to bear the sight of Barty's discomfiture, and a Paston's heartless arrogance. But she was somewhat enraged with the fool and baby of a girl, who, at the outset, and before the world, scouted Barty, answered him in snap pish monosyllables, and looked another way when she spoke to him. This was enough to make Barty's old wound burn again. The lines round his mouth drew together and hardened with yearning and pain, although it must be added, with a little tormenting sense of di version, which would not have laughed out at him under similar provocation, when he was twenty years younger. He was older by a lifetime than Ph\u0153be, and could easily read her self-will.

But he had a way of his own in doing it. He made light of his work, touching only on its defects.

I remember I was eager after the effect of a silvery green foliage against an opal sky, and you see my little liberty with one half of the oaks saved me the trouble of drawing a batch of wil lows.\" This behaviour came from the bad side of Barty's character; and Ph\u0153be Paston, who was accustomed to hold his profession in honour, had thought so badly of his tone in speaking of it, that she had quarrelled"], [143, "After Tea. 131 with him about it when the two were free to dispute. \" You are ashamed of being a painter, sir,\" she had said, \" as some writers are ashamed of being literary men.\" \" No, Miss Paston,\" he had soberly denied the charge ; \" I must let you have a glimpse into the real state of the case : I am ashamed of my own shortcomings.\" Then Ph\u0153be, having an idea how much had been expected of him, and how he had unaccountably fallen short of the goal, judged that he was self-condemned, and in the abundance of her youthful generosity was sorry for him. But to-night, when he tossed about his landscapes \u2014 most of which Ph\u0153be had seen before \u2014 and scoffed at them, for the benefit or the bewilderment of his audience, he got no quarter from her.

Ph\u0153be had heard her father speak in high terms of Wooler's masterly sketches. She herself had sufficient familiarity with art, though without hereditary genius, to see that the drawing was bold and true, the colouring harmonious and vigorous, some times wonderful in its flashes of insight.

It was like a fire in the bones \u2014 something to be looked at with an approach to awe, to be mourned for at times as if it were a possession, and to be gloried in be cause it constituted a noble career.

He had the defects and the excellences which one expects to find in a rarely endowed and rarely-instructed woman. His genius was not creative, but descrip tive ; still, his work had a finish, a faithful ness, a delicacy, and a tenderness which no intelligent man or woman could fail to ap preciate. To Ph\u0153be it seemed that the result was produced by the draining of drop after drop of the artist's life-blood. Well might Ph\u0153be decline to have any thing to do with what seemed to her a heartless, light-minded exhibition. She had been offended before, and she was as much affronted now as if she had listened to a scurrilous jest on a holy life.

The Miss Staceys bent like willows over the table, giggled at the very graveyard of Scutari, wondered how he could do any- thing and everything \u2014 put in a tree, or manage a stone. In their own eyes the Staceys were, without doubt, far above the social rank of artists ; but they had just enough sense and experience to guess that it would be extremely difficult for them to meet with husbands of what they considered their rank in life, since they had not such fortunes as would bribe needy officers or small sprigs of the aristocracy. They had learnt from Miss Coke that art was more"], [148, "136 Noblesse Oblige. genteel, though less remunerative, than trade. They believed, moreover, that Lord Wriothesley was an amateur artist, and mixed somewhat freely with professional men at home and abroad. Barty Wooler himself might be classed as an amateur artist when once he had entered on the Messrs. Clay's riches. Nay, he might then ignore the source of his funds by sinking them in the purchase of an estate, and sub siding gracefully into a country gentleman, with an elegant taste for the fine arts. The Miss Staceys had thus wit to contemplate possibilities. Neither did they neglect to take into account and give due weight to Barty Wooler's handsome person and gen tleman-like attributes.

Miss Rowe, too, looked all round her, with an aroused comprehensive glance. She had not had malice aforethought, but now a recollection flashed upon her which she could not help coupling with the expression on the Wooler faces before her. There had VOL. I.

So far as Miss Rowe knew, there had never been a satisfactory explanation of the affair. As the great gossip of the town, Miss Rowe now felt it a duty, which she had ne glected too long, to sift the old quarrel to the bottom, notwithstanding that the par ties most concerned seemed disposed to let it lapse into oblivion. It was really from a sense of duty, and from what might be called professional pride of character, that Miss Rowe was induced to prosecute the in vestigation. She was not a radically ill natured woman. In spite of some rankling at the loss of her evening's whist, and a dis \u2022 tinct impression that Judith Clay and her son, as well as the Pastons \u2014 all alike up starts in the Wellfield world \u2014 would be none the worse of being taken down a peg or two"], [159, "After Tea. 147 in their own and the public's estimation, she did not enter on the work maliciously.

Ph\u0153be's eye and ear were quick to seize on the clouded brow and the asperity of the tone. It pained her to receive a hint of her father's friend having borne a grudge, and nourished a petty spite and vindictiveness against him, all these years. She had heard of the loss of a college prize wrecking a lad's future career ; but she could not think how defeat on a fair field should have so told on the frank strong man who now stood before her. Inadvertently she stared at Barty until he looked up and directly met her gaze. He read its meaning, and with a fiery flush through his bronzed skin, seemed about to address her in indignant refutation of the unspoken accusation. But he changed his mind a second time the same moment, and diverted the current of conversation. \"Do you go often to Brockcotes, Miss"], [161, "After Tea. 149 Paston ?

Only think how awkward it would have been if war had broken out, and the only son and heir of Lord Exmoor had got to go to it and be killed among all the common soldiers ! No wonder the Earl has made him sell out on account of his duties and honours at home. When I go to Brockcotes I can never get rid of the idea that I shall do something wrong. Mr. Paston he won't take the trouble to show me beforehand, and Ph\u0153be professes she don't know neither what is to come. But she is used to it all, and don't mind the grandeur.

Wooler enjoyed the sensation \u2014 it was a refreshment to him after having been worried and stung. His only doubt was whether he might not pay too dear for his pastime. But he was not too old for mischief, nor nearly too old for waxing dogged and defiant under injury. \" Has the present Earl merged into the queer old fogie he threatened to be when he was Lord Wriothesley ?\" he questioned, carelessly. \" He had a habit of going a fishing in a Quaker's hat, and of sitting cross-legged to read his letters on the steps of that precious encumbrance of a statue to the man who, as I have heard tell, hunted over my grandfather's farm in season and out of season, and at the same time hunted the poor old Methodist preachers out of the town.

Lady Dorothea had not merely been like a bright, particular star to her, but was something between her princess and her sister, from whom she had never swerved in her allegiance. She did not care if some people called her a snob, but she could not bear to listen to Barty's scornful sarcasms.

In truth, he was anxious to make it up with Ph\u0153be, for he was burden ed with compunctions which she did not seem inclined to take off his hand. Yet he was not conscious of having gone very far wrong. He had been rude certainly, and in his own house, too, but then he had been provoked into speaking out freely.

She was afraid it would make her feel terribly old to have a son-in-law, not only grown-up, but well-nigh as old as Paston ; but there was one thing, Mr. Wooler was a fine-looking man, and she had always gone in for beauty. Mr. and Mrs. Barty Wooler would, no doubt, go off and enjoy themselves, and she would be left with old Mrs. Wooler, who looked as if she could snap her up. But she was prepared to sacrifice herself to aid her daughter's tri umph. She was even willing to let it be understood that she was half a dozen years older than she was. These tokens of her mother's excited weakness were harder lines to Ph\u0153be than all that had gone before. She was con-"], [172, "Noblesse Oblige. 160 vinced that Barty understood it all. She did not know that he had said to himself that her mother was more like a superannu ated canary than anything else in the world ; yet, although she was not informed of his words, she instinctively guessed his feelings. She could ill brook from an unfavoured suitor what she would have barely tolerated from a man she loved, because there might be an inopportune sense of the ludicrous, but substantial good-will would exist along with it, and filial respect would come in time. The sole house of any pretensions in Wooers' Alley was the Pastons.' It had been the old rectory, and it not only com manded a near view of St. Basil's, with the warlike battlements to its peaceful tower, and the thick clothing of ever-young ivy wandering and winding up its gray but tresses, but it bore in itself a likeness to"], [173, "The Walk to Wooers' Alley. 161 Close architecture in its mulboned windows with their heavy ledges, its peaked coping above the door, and its close-shaven court, which suffered what seemed the wanton gaiety of orchard and garden to drop into the background.

She had been born and brought up in it, and had spent all but the last eighteen months of her life in it. And in spite of the Folksbridge people's depreciation of the little town, Ph\u0153be was staunchly fond of it. Though she had seen the world lately, and had ad mired many a greater and grander scene, the true heart had always turned to Well field and its picturesque corners.

Ph\u0153be had never ceased to look forward to two things on her return home \u2014 to walking up to Brockcotes, and to strolling leisurely and delightedly along Wooers' Alley at sun set or at moonrise. Less than three months ago she would have regarded Barty Wooler's escort, not as a drawback, but as a boon. Being a Well field man, she could not have the happiness of acting as his cicerone in Wooers' Alley. But who, save her father, could better ap preciate its many glories ?

Three months ago she would have prattled to Barty Wooler freely and fearlessly on every object of the walk, and would have prized each one of them the more for the freedom and the inspiration of the prattle. But now, be cause he desired to have all her prattle to himself, he should have none of it. Thus their whole relations were disturbed and overturned.

So he had to console himself with the simple facts of the walk on the early autumn even ing, and with the conquest of Mrs. Paston \u2014 a triumph which in other circumstances he could perhaps have dispensed with. Ph\u0153be would have been full of unmixed thankfulness that the walk was at an end, had it not been for the incident with which it closed. Mr. Paston met them at the door. He was a man of whom it could be written, \" Much study had made him very lean and pale and leaden-eyed.\" He was a little like Ph\u0153be, but wasted and worn, and with all her buoyant life and high courage stifled and broken. Still there was a deep, ardent, repressed glow in his eyes, and he looked the very type of a man marked out for neuralgia, heart-complaint, breast-pang, pa ralysis.

Notwithstanding the hour, he wanted Barty to come in, and when Barty declined, he said emphatically, \" Come when you like, Wooler ; remember, you are always welcome.\" Ph\u0153be's father was not like her mother. He was a wiser man in his generation \u2014 proud and delicate-minded. In his strong affection for his only child he was not likely to be carried away by public clamour or private vanity.

IHERE was one room in the old Rec- tory at Wooers' Alley which Ph\u0153be, after her return from Folksbridge, loved and prized even more than she had done before she went away. This room did not offend her more matured and trained taste as the drawing-room undoubtedly did.

But her mother, who had not an original idea in furniture any more than in"], [179, "ln the Painting-room. 167 dress, was not accountable for this.

The Wooers' Alley drawing-room (in its solitary state literally the drawing-room of Wooers' Alley) exhibited a faded transcript of that phase of Caleb Paston's life, when he came back from Rome wearing a blue cloak, a coat with crimson-lined sleeves, and a cameo ring. He had now left that period of his life far behind, but he had not sought to bring his drawing-room into correspon dence with his advanced experience. Indeed, he had ceased to notice the details of a room into which he went but seldom, and only to rest when he did go.

As for Ph\u0153be, ever since her return she had been wanting to see everything with the old unquestioning eyes, and had, at the same time, been striving to tone down the deep distinct colours of the drawing-room furni ture \u2014 the scarlet and black of its vandycked curtains, and the apple-green ground of its carpet \u2014 and been doing all she could to soften what was odd and fantastic in the preponderance of eagles, griffins, and ser pents. Her ambition was to blend into greater unity the curiosity chairs and cabi nets, and to make the most of the few good pictures, which were very much marred by the bad light and by their accompaniments. She had done what she could to keep the room from speaking \" shop \" to a degree and in a manner quite incongruous with English middle-class home-life."], [181, "In the Painting-room. 169 But this other room in the old Rectory Ph\u0153be thought was fit to be looked at after the Brockcotes rooms. She felt it was as far beyond any of the rooms at Garnet Lodge as works of art are beyond the mere products of wealth. This was her father's painting-room. He and Ph\u0153be did not call it a studio, holding the term to be a foreign affectation. Mr. Paston rarely tolerated visitors here, even when he was not working, unless, in deed, it might be an employer like Lord Ex moor. Mrs. Paston never crossed the door, having an obstinate aversion to the smell of paints. Besides, she laboured under the standing grievance that Mr. Paston would never warn her to keep off his easel till it was too late, and declined to prompt her as to what she should notice and admire, so as to save her from mistakes which were awk ward in an artist's wife."], [182, "170 Noblesse Oblige. But Ph\u0153be had been free of her father's painting-room from the time when she served as a professional child-model, even before she was able to walk with a hold of his hand to Brockcotes. Her father had said she was such a quiet little woman that she never dis turbed him or did mischief. The quietness, however, proceeded from her not having been brought much into contact with other children, rather than from her being a phe nomenon of infantine discretion. She soon got a small appreciation of his performances, and would walk round them of her own accord, her plump little balls of hands osten tatiously and sagely clasped behind her back; all the while contemplating the pictures at her ease, like a little old virtuoso.

Art, he felt, was long \u2014 too long, too arduous, and too exclusive a path for any but a very ex ceptional woman's safe tread. Mr. Paston was too grateful for a little tolerably intelli gent sympathy to lament that it was not the sympathy of a rival, in a rivalry that should ultimately carry the girl away on the en grossing current of her own fortunes. It was a great step granted to Ph\u0153be when she was told that she might enter her father's painting-room in his absence, look at its contents as she liked, and thus store up observations and conclusions for the painter's benefit the next time they should have a talk."], [184, "172 Noblesse Oblige. About a week after the Woolers' party, she was spending an evening by herself in the painting-room, where she was most se cure from interruption and intrusion. She was now acting as housekeeper, her father and mother having gone to visit Aunt Sally, a sister of Mr. Paston's. Aunt Sally moved in a somewhat humbler walk of life than the Pastons, but was in quite comfortable circumstances. She was married to a par ish-clerk and schoolmaster, about ten miles distant from Wellfield, and was tenacious in demanding that her kindred who had risen in the world should come and see her, and taste of her hospitality once a year or so, or make up their minds to be baited and bom barded by her bitter reproaches. The or deal was such, that Mr. Paston, though not a visiting man, preferred the first alternative. The painting-room was at the back of the house, and had been the old Rectory dining-"], [185, "In the Painting-room. 173 room. It was lit entirely from one side, and by pleasant oriel windows, which looked into the orchard and flower-garden.

Ripening am ber and purple plums, straw-coloured cod ling apples \u2014 earliest of the apple tribe \u2014 and mottled russet-green pears, were drop ping on the grass. Silver stars of asters, golden suns of marigolds, Versailles ranks of hollyhocks and dahlias stood confronting each other, with the early dusk softening their features, or the harvest moon bright ening them \u2014 all being evidence that the September race-week, the gala of the Well field year, with its company, honours, ex citement, and profits, was near at hand. As Mr. Paston did not work at night, and objected to the presence of gas in his"], [186, "Noblesse Oblige. 174 room, there was no chandelier. In its stead there was an oil reading-lamp.

You know you are on for bidden ground, Frank ; papa will not let anybody in here unless he is here himself.\" \" But I'm not anybody, Ph\u0153be, any more than yourself,\" persisted Frank Hall, keeping his ground unabashed ; \" may not a nobody come in ?\" Ph\u0153be hesitated ; she knew very well that it was the last thought likely to be seriously entertained by Frank Hall that he was a nobody ; but she did not want to over step her instructions.

Although fault finding was Frank's trade, she knew he was capable of something better. But she was discomposed by the presence of the stranger, very likely another ironical journalist, whom her cousin did not introduce to her. She decided, at last, that her father would prefer that she should lean to the side of liberality and courtesy, and she granted Frank Hall and his companion the required permission. \" Since you have come so far, Frank, I suppose I am not obliged to turn you out. But you must make up your mind to behave like a nobody \u2014 take no notice of anything you see, and not go and lay down the law about it afterwards ; or if you do I shall never forgive myself.\" \"You may depend upon my behaving like a nobody, Miss Paston,\" Frank's anony mous friend broke in ; \" for I have not a"], [196, "Noblesse Oblige. 184 particle of claim to any other character.\" Still Frank did not introduce the stranger, and Ph\u0153be had a passing notion that it was somewhat odd that he should address her by name without an introduction. Frank stood looking at his companions as though his acute pug-nose were sniffing a little sur prise and a good deal of amusement in the air, very much, indeed, as if he had expect ed the persons before him to have known and recognised each other. Seeing the posi tion of affairs, Ph\u0153be became possessed with the conviction that the under-sized, dark, pleasant-looking young man of three or four and twenty must be some other newspaper man (higher bred, and not smelling so un mistakably of tobacco) whom she had met in Frank Hall's society at Garnet Lodge or at Folksbridge, and whom she ought to greet and welcome to Wellfield. Yet in spite of the most strenuous effort of memory she"], [197, "Surprised and Mystified. 185 could not recall when or where she had seen her new acquaintance. The low stature which had elegance in it, and the face that was largely forehead, eyes, and soft mous tache and beard, she could not remember, though once seen they were not likely to be forgotten. She could not arrive at any more definite conclusion than that she must have seen the gentleman before. Ph\u0153be felt that the vagueness of the ante cedents made her position awkward, and she dreaded that Frank Hall, though senior of the party by half a dozen years, might be tempted to farther mystification and mis chief. She was eager to make a diversion by showing the pictures. Frank told her that in for a penny was in for a pound, and added something about holding a key to the position beforehand, so that a surreptitious advantage was of no moment.

The stranger must be an artist like her father, and not a jour nalist like Frank. But how could she have come to think she had seen him before, while all the time she was satisfied that Barty Wooler was the only artist whose ac quaintance she had made since she left her father's house? Frank had brought his artist friend to see her father's pictures, and it was hard to say whether the cousins had been altogether discreet in the manner in which the purpose had been fulfilled. \" It is bad enough to have a round-eyed"], [199, "Surprised and Mystified. 187 baby to represent the typical mother, but a vile woman of the world is a mighty deal worse,\" remarked Frank Hall, with dry directness, as he looked at the Del Sarto. He had no relentings towards the wicked, or, for that matter, towards the foolish of the world. Ph\u0153be proceeded to illuminate one of her father's pictures, which he had painted a number of years before. He still kept it on his wall, and occasionally retouched it, although he sometimes disparaged it as being maniere and harsh, like his early version of the Brockcotes tragedy. At least Ph\u0153be remembered that when her father had shown his pictures to his old friend, Wooler had advanced to it, and looked at it without permitting himself an expression either of praise or censure, although he had been commenting on the others very freely.

Ph\u0153be could not consent to measure its deserts by their standard, but neither could she set up her opinion in opposition to theirs. Accordingly she displayed the picture with a doubtful qualm of her responsible daughter's heart. The painting was a version of the apocry phal legend of one of the Bellini stealing from another Italian painter the secret of painting in oils \u2014 a secret which had before then cost Andrea the assassin his crime, and the victim his life. The Bellini, in the dis guise of a Venetian cavalier, strolls into his fellow's studio, and in the character of a sitter introduces himself to the envied pos sessor of the grand arcanum of painters. During the sitting, while the unsuspicious painter mixes his pigments, the Bellini nar-"], [201, "Surprised and Mystified. 189 rowly watches, and learns the medium which by comparison left the juice of figs as weak as water. Caleb Paston had not only re produced the medi\u00e6val studio and the figures \u2014 the unsuspicious worker manifestly triumphing in the hidden, hard-earned know ledge, which is now unconsciously oozing from his finger-ends, and the eager, ab sorbed spectator, masking his interest by pretending to play with the painter's popin jay \u2014 but had rendered the whole with something of the justness and concentration which belonged to his last, best style. In particular he had lent to the darkened face of the Bellini a devouring anxiety, a despair ing necessity, which made his discovery a matter of life and death to him. \" This is not bad,\" said Frank Hall's asso ciate, using a quiet negative form of praise, that needed all the cordiality and pleasure of the tone to keep Ph\u0153be from spurning"], [202, "190 Noblesse Oblige. it as an ill-conceived and unmerited slight on her father's established reputation. \" This is not the Bellini, however,\" ob jected the young connoisseur ; \" at least, I have seen Gian Bellini's portrait at all periods of his life, and this is none of him. It is a fancy likeness ; I take it there is more in it of the man who painted it than of Bellini.

Ph\u0153be herself had a quick remorseful feel ing that such vehement jesting in earnest might seem bold and ungracious in the eyes of a stranger. Several influences contributed to the result.

She was pursuing two lines of thought. The main line, which she kept to herself. was something like this : \" And so this boy is at Brockcotes too. What right can he"], [215, "Surprised and Mystified. 203 have to be there ? Surely Frank can never have been so outrageously independent as to carry a companion unasked to share in the Brockcotes hospitalities.

The Earl is very good, but he never forgets that he is the Earl of Exmoor ; and no one else forgets it, save a noisy artist of the Barty Wooler type, or a man of letters like Frank, notwithstanding that he pretends to polish, and has an idea of going into Parliament, and becoming a great man in politics.

I have a sketch of Lady Dorothea in coloured chalks, which was not done by papa, but was sent me from Munich, and is hung in my own room, but I do not think it does her half just ice. The Countess does not care to sit, though papa has painted her ; so did Leslie on her marriage, and Thorburn in a group with her children. Lord Wriothesley has been so much away from Brockcotes, since he was a little fellow, that we would not know a portrait of him at Wellfield, though we had it.\" Ph\u0153be ended in the slight accent of ill-"], [217, "Surprised and Mystified. 205 usage with which Wellfield was beginning to allude to the protracted absence of the heir apparent. \" Since he was a little fellow,\" repeated the stranger, as if in absence of mind, and Frank Hall laughed at this indiscretion. The artist continued : \" I hope Lord Wrio thesley will not disappoint you either in the flesh or on the canvas when he does turn up. The worst thing of a rara avis is, that when you've got it in your hand, it is so apt to prove but a common crow.\" Ph\u0153be flashed up again, as the champion of the Brockcotes family. \"Lord Wriothesly has taken a double first at Oxford,\" she urged warmly, setting the young man right, and putting an end to her own stiffness ; \" he is very clever. With his abilities and position, he must do some thing great.\" \" But what on earth is there great left for"], [218, "206 Noblesse Oblige. him to do ?\" argued his detractor, showing a strong sense of the difficulty. \" The handle to his name may have helped him to his class \u2014 I don't doubt that there are tuft hunters among the examiners as well as among the students.

We have pinned our faith to him, and mean to be very proud of his triumph.\" \" I suppose patentee of the green wax, or surveyor of the meltings at the Mint, would hardly suit Lady Dorothea's book or yours?\" questioned her opponent. Ph\u0153be did not recognise the quizzical al lusion, and with the strong prejudice of her years against being laughed at, had a still more decided objection to the process as being performed by an assuming lad whom Frank Hall thought fit to carry hither and thither with him. \" Lord Wriothesley ought to be very grate ful,\" concluded the young man more seri ously. \"For what?\" asked Frank Hall cyni cally ; \" for having honours thrust upon"], [220, "Noblesse Oblige. 208 him, or for having other people borrow his honours ?\" * \"Never mind, Hall. He ought to be grateful, and, what is more, I believe he is. \" Well,\" said Frank, with a still queerer look than any that had gone before, \" you should know best.\" And he followed this up by a brusque statement that if they meant to show themselves to the Countess, they could not trespass on Ph\u0153be's patience any longer. So he took leave of his cousin in haste. When the gentlemen were gone Ph\u0153be tried to escape out of the labyrinth she had been led into, and to cast off the incubus of baulked curiosity. But simple as the clue was, its very simplicity, and the pre-occupa tion of her mind, made her miss it. The only conclusion she could arrive at was, that Frank, like his tribe, had a propensity for"], [221, "Surprised and Mystified. 209 doing things differently from other people, and had no objection to astonishing his friends. Ph\u0153be liked Frank Hall all the same, and was proud of the position which he had attained among journalists, while, nevertheless, she railed at him and his affect ation. \" Ph\u0153be,\" cried Mr. Paston, prepared to bring an accusation against his daughter on his coming into the drawing-room next day, \" Ph\u0153be, what scrape is this you have got into ?\" \"Is it my allowing Frank Hall and his friend to come into your painting-room last night, papa ?\" inquired Ph\u0153be without much perturbation, as she leant forward to arrange a glass full of purple and white stocks on the table before her. \" Frank was in the doorway before I saw him, and I could not very well turn both him and his friend out ; but you know I told you all about it when VOL. i. p"], [222, "210 Noblesse Oblige. you came home this morning, and of the other man whom I could not make out, and whom Frank did not take the trouble to name.\" \" Humph ! the man you could not make out !

As it was, he took refuge in a bit of hyperbole. \" I daresay Hall took notes of the scene. It might serve some friend who writes for the Olympic or the Adelphi.\" \" I could not have said anything very bad,\" reasoned Ph\u0153be, readily taking con solation to herself now that her father in dulged in humorous exaggeration, \" because there is nothing bad to be said of the Brock cotes family.

Lord Wriothesley, like his father, was quiet and simple, unconsciously dignified and affable ; and he was, in addition, Lady Dorothea's own brother in quick intelli gence and the abandonment with which he threw himself into a subject. Until he rose to go he did no more than take Ph\u0153be, who kept in the background the better to cover her confusion, into the general scope of his looks and words. Then he addressed"], [227, "Surprised and Mystified. 215 her particularly to offer his sincere excuses for his share in the misunderstanding and mystification. \" It was an accident, Miss Paston, and al together unpremeditated.

For that matter, art was a mild specialty of the house of Exmoor. The present Earl had always made Paston's painting-room a lounge when he was in Wellfield ; and in this he had only followed the example of his father, who was supposed to have dis covered and developed the genius of the charity school-boy. The Countess, too, dis played a subdued tinge of the art tendency in her indefatigable labours at the Coun tesses' drawing-room hangings, and in her elevation of the embroidery into a business of importance. Lady Dorothea, the most original member of the family, had least of the prevailing bent. The natives of Wellfield, on their part, thought the Latimer love of art an aristocra tic weakness \u2014 very amiable, but still a weakness, and occasionally murmured at it, as carrying an undue amount of the august family countenance into one narrow channel."], [231, "Lord Wriothesley at Home. 219 Why should Lord Exmoor frequent Mr. Paston's painting-room more than the Rec tory, the family doctor's house, or the attor ney's ?

As for Frank Hall, he was really too busy to take note of his noble ally. He was en grossed with the necessity of acquiring well bred ease in shooting over great covers in the morning, and dining at great tables in the evening. He could not get to Wooers' Alley on his own account, except merely on flying visits, and this chiefly to repeat expla nations of his continued absence. Nevertheless, Frank's presence served to help his friend, within the briefest space of weeks, to establish himself on a familiar foot ing with the household at Wooers' Alley.

At the same time, he wiled Ph\u0153be from her displeasure with him and her disgust with herself. There is this fur ther to be said, that the manner in which the two made each other's acquaintance had left a personality in their intercourse which could not have existed had they been origin ally presented to each ether as chief and vassal.

Even Ph\u0153be was forced to own reluctantly that Lady Doro thea would be spoiled if this trait grew in her. It is true she had been so thoroughly well brought up, that the inclination did not show itself in her behaviour towards her father and mother, to whom she was altogether sweet and submissive. But it peeped out, perhaps all the more obtrusively, in her dealings with her brother. Not that he was jealous or irritable under it.

At last he even proposed to sit to Mr. Paston for a portrait which the Countess wished to have taken. If the young nobleman had a double motive, like the Bellini, he had a fair field for his machinations.

But at last the foolish fancy enteredherhot young head that hewastrying to bribe her by the promise of making her the richest woman in Folksbridge, \u2014 the temptation with which her cousins, nay, even Lady Dorothea, had assailed her. \" It is useless to tell me all this, Mr. Wooler ; I can never change my mind.\" He grew a little pale, and his full tones became harsh as he said, with a tolerably successful effort at composure \u2014 \" I have done, Miss Paston.

Pray do me the small fa vour \u2014 no, don't be frightened.\" He paused to reassure her, with an inevitable grimness in his smile, and then went on : \"I don't think you will object to do me this favour. It is only to offer my excuses to your father. When we spoke of it the other morning, I promised to tell him how my mission fared ; but a man does not like to be bearer of the news of his own defeat, if he can help it. Of course, if you have any objection, I shall not ask you to do this for me.\" Ph\u0153be could only mutter that she did not object. Barty took her hand for an in stant, lifted his hat formally, and left the garden. Ph\u0153be was conscious of a shadow falling across the sunshine, of a chill coming into the air, and of a sense of blank regret and sharp self-accusation. She looked round her half stunned, half scared, and thought"], [268, "Noblesse Oblige. 256 the little flower-garden was barren and hard in its stereotyped brightness. She looked down at herself in her dainty buff skirt and jacket, and wondered if she, whom he had called, by implication, callous, were as hard and shallow as the garden. Heretofore she had always preferred the cool, grave court, with the sober old flower-border, to the new showy flower-beds. But she would hate the latter, after this day's work. She saw Barty again with the same eyes as when she had admired him in the beginning of their acquaintance. Her father's estima tion of him must be correct, and she would not see his like again as a lover. Not that she dreamt she could have accepted him, but it was a grief to her that there had been no alternative found but to decline his dearest wishes, and destroy his fairest prospects of happiness. He had said so. She was sorry now, and even ashamed of"], [269, "A Love Tale. 257 the manner of the deed. She was sensible when it was too late, that she had not be haved well under the trial. She felt she had been ungracious and ungenerous to a man who had distinguished her by his highest regard. Ph\u0153be's remorse lasted till her reluctant feet had carried her to the threshold of her father's painting-room. She stood there, not only shy and shrinking, but waiting till she could see an inch before her. The change from the broad yellow afternoon sunshine, the fresh air, and the vivid mosaic of the flower-beds, to the dimness of the painting-room, in which the plaster-casts looked like ghosts and the pictures shadows, struck her as it had never done before. Here her father led a charmed life in a world of his own, and was now finishing a spell of long and hard work. It seemed to agree with him at present. He was stand- VOL. i. s"], [270, "Noblesse Oblige. 258 ing before a picture of the \" Reconciliation of Jacob and Esau,\" which he had lately sketched in. Judging from his low whistl ing \u2014 a trick which was not native to him, but which he had caught from Barty Wooler \u2014 he was looking at it with satisfaction. But Mr. Paston was not so lost to sympa thy that he did not anticipate Ph\u0153be's con fession as soon as her guilty face appeared in the door-way. She did not need to in troduce the subject, for he turned round on her with a sharp interrogation. \" You haven't had a difference with Wooler ? \u2014 you haven't dismissed him with out the simple grace of considering the mat ter, and without consulting your friends, Ph\u0153be ? I had hoped better things of ss you. Mr. Paston contrived on the instant to scatter Ph\u0153be's compunction to the winds. What was there to consider in the matter ?"], [271, "A Love Tale. 259 What had her friends to do with her choice ? Ph\u0153be was very jealous of the freedom of her heart. Mr. Paston was stricken with disappoint ment, but he did not utter another word of displeasure. Instead of walking up and down, and venting his excitement in irritable complaints, according to his custom, he stood sorely vexed and mortified. He did not say to Ph\u0153be that his life was precarious ; that he could not do more for her and her mother than leave them fairly provided for. He did not seek to entice Ph\u0153be by refer ence to Barty Wooler's prospects. Let peo ple say what they would, Caleb Paston was not a mercenary men. But when he spoke again, there was a poignancy of regret in the tone in which he vindicated and reproached himself in a breath, as if he had been in fault, and not Ph\u0153be. \" Bear me witness, Ph\u0153be,\" he said, \" that s2"], [272, "260 Noblesse Oblige.

I know you could not help it, but it cuts me up. I meant you to be happy, child : who should care for your happiness if I do not ? I thought all the mischief was to be remedied. Barty and I long worked together ; not that we were equals, though I was very fond of him. He was my superior then, above me in every respect, and yet who so pleasant, or so lavish in his regard and confidence?

She had come in from the garden with very conflicting feelings ; and she opened wide, moist eyes at the outpouring of her father's disappointment. But in the end she was hardened rather than softened. She did not, however, remind her father how little there could be in common between a man who was blustering, headstrong and overbearing, even in his courtship, and a re tired, absorbed artist. She did not argue that there must be something illusive in the friendship which could be suffered to lie dor mant for twenty years. That would have been to say that she was wiser than her father, and Ph\u0153be did not say it, although she did not escape the thought. Ph\u0153be was tormented by the suspicion that her father had deceived himself into expecting terribly unreasonable things of her,"], [276, "264 Noblesse Oblige. because of an early partiality and a recent caprice. He had not been wont to act thus, but he had always been exceptional and eccentric. She now fully realised this for the first time. She had a dread that her father had been betrayed into exaggeration, into speaking melodramatically. She ex perienced an aching sense of the weakness of one dear and reverenced, together with a quick desire to shield both him and herself from the result of this weakness. She took courage to re-enter the painting room shortly after her dismissal. \" Papa, I am very sorry that I have vexed you and Mr. Wooler. I did not think that I was coming home to do this,\" she ended abruptly, with a swelling heart, as her father sunk down in an attitude of weariness, and leant his gray head on his hand.

It was something more than the ordinary awkwardness of getting rid of an unwelcome suitor, and of feeling constrained, as a point of duty, to tell her story to the head of the family. It was an event which fancifully grieved and mortified her father, and swept away a dream which he had taken to his heart. It did not follow because Mr. Paston had received the information that he would communicate it to his wife. Not that the couple lived unhappily. They got on as well as could be expected in the manifold shortcomings which exposed a life's mistake. But besides a turn for sarcasm in his speech with her, Mr. Paston had acquired, almost unconsciously, a habit of not seeing and hearing his wife. This involved the avoid ance of tete-a-tetes with her, above all on any subject which deeply interested him. It was a minor fret to Ph\u0153be to break"], [278, "266 Noblesse Oblige. the facts to her mother, who was, as she expressed it, \" struck all in a heap \" by Ph\u0153be's audacity, improvidence, and in gratitude.

But, to do Mrs. Paston justice, she did no more than whimperingly bewail. She was as incapable of sustained resentment as of magnanimous silence. Ph\u0153be was her father's daughter, young as she was. Mrs. Paston had always said that Ph\u0153be had a mind of her own, cruel and cross as it was to proclaim this of her own child. She washed her hands of the business in which she had never been consulted.

And then the story had to be confided to Lady Dorothea, if only to silence her specu lations. She disapproved, like the rest ; but she arrogated no right of friendship to resent the step Ph\u0153be had taken on her own responsibility, or even to reproach her gossip.

The races this year were expected to be particularly good, from the fact of their being patronized by the Marquis of Fair chester, Lord Exmoor's intended son-in-law. That the event was in anticipation of the greater gala of the Marquis's marriage with Lady Dorothea, was a circumstance, too, which had its effect. Additional flocks of county gentry, with numbers of the remoter allies and adherents of Lord Fairchester, were thus attracted to Wellfield. Ph\u0153be was anxious to see Lord Fairches ter, and to judge for herself whether his personal qualities were on a level with his titles and estates, so as to render him a fit match for Lady Dorothea.

But Lady Dorothea was far from content with herself; anything like tremor was foreign to her, and, accord ing to her code, very unsuitable. \" I don't know what has come over me,\" her ladyship said confidentially to Ph\u0153be, as she sat sipping her tea after Mrs. Paston had left the two together, not caring, save by proxy, to have the honour of an Earl's daughter's regard. \" I have as much need of something to steady my nerves as a washerwoman, Ph\u0153be, and I don't conceal from you that it is about Fairchester. I have been thinking all the morning how nice it would be to be \u2014 not a milkmaid, for it strikes me milkmaids stumble on their fate in a manner not unlike our own \u2014 but a girl of the middle-class, like you and your cou sins, the Halls. How pleasant it would be u2"], [304, "292 Noblesse Oblige. to form acquaintances naturally, consulting your own individual taste, and to go on, with the acquaintance ripening into friend ship, and, by slow degrees, into something else.\" \" I am afraid girls of every class and grade have their own difficulties and griefs,\" said Ph\u0153be, wistfully, more to fill up a pause than anything else. \" No doubt, my dear child ; but there are difficulties and difficulties, as our French neighbours express it. I can remember, when I was quite a baby, hearing Harris solemnly informing her acquaintances that I was ' bringing-up ' for my Lord Fairchester ; but it is not so pleasant, Ph\u0153be, when one is brought up to the stake.\" Lady Dorothea was guilty of inconsist ency, like the rest of the world. In her unwonted mood she had forgotten how slightingly she had spoken of the accidents"], [305, "An Unexpected Pleasure. 293 of middle-class marriages on that first day Ph\u0153be had gone up to Brockcotes after her return from Folksbridge ; and how, on the same occasion, she had dwelt with the most unquestioning worldliness on certain advant ages possessed by Barty Wooler \u2014 on his be ing a painter, Mr. Paston's old friend, and having the solid inheritance of the Clays in store. But though Lady Dorothea had for gotten all this, Ph\u0153be had not. \" My hand is shaking,\" cried Lady Doro thea, in extreme vexation and disgust. \" I declare the next thing will be that I shall drop through the floor when we meet in the drawing-room ; and there will be so many eyes on us. Oh, dear !\" sighed Lady Doro thea, as she broke off in a sudden exaspera tion \u2014 \" you won't mind my saying it, Ph\u0153be, since Mr. Hall is our esteemed and invited guest, and we are not likely to forget that we are his obliged hosts, but isn't it hard to"], [306, "294 Noblesse Oblige. have a press-man here just now ? Why ! Mr. Hall may condescend to write a fashionable novel some day, and may now be taking notes of my costume and conduct to fill an odd chapter. We are never free from our enemies. They hover over us like lovers, and harass us like avenging furies. I should be the last person to deny that we owe a duty to the public ; but is it not enough to have reporters at our banquets, our battles, our Parliaments, our operas ? Must we also carry them into our family meetings, and our withdrawing rooms ?\" Ph\u0153be could not help laughing at this spurt at Frank Hall. She said she was sure he would not write a fashionable novel, or a novel of any kind for that matter, since there was no sentiment in his composition. Then she tried to comfort Lady Dorothea by the assurance that she had heard Lord Fairchester was sensible and amiable ; and"], [307, "A n Unexpected Pleasure. 295 that her ladyship might therefore depend on his doing all that was considerate and kind to support her in the trying position in which she was placed. \" Of course he is good,\" Lady Dorothea assented, a little impatiently, \" or the affair would not have been thought of by a good father like the Earl. I don't deny that the Blounts, taking them all in all, have had but indifferent characters, except in the matter of contriving to extend their lands ; still they have not been the very worst of us. They have never committed murder that I have .heard of, or turned Turks, or been convicted of robbery, apart from faroe tables and rouge et noir banks. But they have contracted an awkward habit of being ex pelled from their colleges, and they have once or twice stood a court-martial, which makes one quake for the family reputation when one remembers that Mr. Blount is"], [308, "Noblesse Oblige. 296 still in the navy. But all that is past, we trust, and the family are going to make an effort to gain their proper place in the country. The late Countess, a Spencer, was an excellent woman. Still, I must con fess that her son seems to have monopolized her valuable qualities. Lady Penelope and Lady Louisa are headstrong, silly girls. As for Mr. Blount, who is Fairchester's heir presumptive, I am afraid he is a desperately mauvais sujet. But he must be borne with; for it is everybody's duty to bear with and provide for his or her black-sheep.\" Lady Dorothea, though high-minded, was tender of the black-sheep of her class. She ignored them when she could, and when she could not, she spoke of them as unlucky and blank supernumeraries, but not as out casts from their social rank. \"You see,\" she went on, \"it is no longer as in the days when gentlemen had the"], [309, "An Unexpected Pleasnre. 297 dangerous capacity7 for uniting manly am bition with love of pleasure. Fairches ter's grandfather and great-grandfather were four-bottle men, and libertines of the second-water at least. But they \"were also mighty hunters and zealous placemen. They were never found straying from their peers' benches. They neither missed the division at five o'clock the one morning, nor failed to fill their saddles at the same hour down at their own country-seats the next.\" \" You draw a striking picture of the old race, Lady Dorothea, and you are not afraid to throw in the dark shadow in the back ground,\" observed Ph\u0153be. \" But it's a true picture, Ph\u0153be,\" her ladyship went on. \"The only thing the Blountswereeasyinwasas to theirown morals and those of their neighbours.

Do y7ou know, Ph\u0153be, that I think the late Lord Charlton, considerably refined from their grossness, was the very last of the great old men of quality, precisely as the Earl of Warwick was the last of the barons? But about poor Mr. Blount : he has nothing of his forefathers in him, save their tainted addiction to riotous living. He has none of the Stanhope wit, and is more like the ill-fated Herveys.\" \" But you are not going to marry Mr. Blount, Lady Dorothea,\" suggested Ph\u0153be. \" God forbid, Ph\u0153be !\" her ladyship ex claimed, with hasty emphasis. \" That could not have been thought of for a moment in our family, not even though Lord Fairches ter had made up his mind never to marry.

Dear ! the men only whisper it as yet, and they would be fit to take off my head if they knew of our talking over these matters ; so take care and keep state secrets, Ph\u0153be. But who can say that such is not Fairches ter's and Wriothesley's fit avocation ?\" Ph\u0153be ventured to break the impressed silence in which she sat by remarking \u2014 \" You remember, Lady Dorothea, how often I have agreed with you as to Lord Wriothesley's cleverness ?

But as the work has been given Fairchester to do, I suppose he can wait till his tongue is loosed, and he can, meta phorically, speak plain, and then go forward and take his proper post among his peers. Even if he cannot be such a public speaker as to fit him for leader, his immense stake will constitute him a Fin MacCoul of a fol lower.\" \" I think, Lady Dorothea, that it must be a great lot to be such a man's wife,\" said Ph\u0153be."], [313, "An Unexpected Pleasure. 301 \" Yes, my child ; it is a great lot,\" Lady Dorothea admitted, frankly, with her eyes sparkling, and her hands clasped in her lap ; \" to be the means of aiding him in breaking his bonds, and at last fulfilling the pledges so largely forfeited by his ancestors, and, with the aid of a powerful and honourable connexion, to help to rescue a great family from the slough in which it has been content to wallow for centuries.\" \" Yes, it is a great lot,\" repeated Ph\u0153be, with bated breath, as thought and enthusi asm struggled in her mind. Lady Dorothea's intense matter-of-factness had crystallised into something like a vein of poetry at once homely and heroic, as in deed is the nature of all concentration of idea and purpose. Ph\u0153be Paston looked at her friend in ad miration, but not without a species of trou ble at the ungirlish sacrifice which Lady"], [314, "Noblesse Oblige. 302 Dorothea was contemplating. It was plain she could not make the offering without pain and shrinking. \" As if I were the first bride of Brock cotes who has had her burden to bear,\" her ladyship exclaimed, impetuously, after a pause, taking herself sharply to task. \" I could give you legends to the contrary, fit subjects for a painter's daughter \u2014 I must not say a painter's mistress noiv, Ph\u0153be.\" Ph\u0153be winced a little, but as she said no thing, Lady Dorothea went on \u2014 \"There was Joan Latimer, married at fifteen to Lord Scrope, who was forced to have the knot tied at once, that he might make sure of her dower lands, though it was but three days before he was to embark for the siege of Orleans, where he was slain by a shot from a French culverin. There, now, isn't that something for a painter ?\" \" It is something for poet as well as"], [315, "An Unexpected Pleasure. 303 painter, in my opinion, Lady Dorothea,\" said Ph\u0153be. \" Yes, something for a poet too, though the main interest is pictorial, as one might say. But, to my mind, there was not so much pictorial as pathetic in the case of that Elizabeth, believed to be the great heiress of Earl Evelyn \u2014 the same Lady Elizabeth whose portrait in a white hood hangs over the cedar door in the blue bed-room, which her ghost is said to haunt, as if it had not had enough of earth ! But we don't believe in ghosts. She was only Earl Evelyn's heiress, till his son Earl Geoffrey was born, late in the family. My poor, far-away Aunt Elizabeth had the small-pox the same year, and, being marred alike in fortune and in face, her mar riage with one of the sensual, proud Somer sets went on notwithstanding, although he never looked on his wife's scarred face after their miserable marriage, until he had satis-"], [316, "Noblesse Oblige. 304 fied himself that it lay, without deception, in the coffin.

It seems to me that I am cut out for an independent, single life. The living woman I envy is Miss Bur dett Coutts. We have some old letters from Anne Pitt, Chatham's sister, and Fanny Pelham, the Duke of Newcastle's laughter (who both died unmarried), to their spright ly contemporary7, Lady Dolly Latimer. And you have no notion how enjoyable these letters read, although you must make allow ance for the coarseness of the age.

No one can say that I would en courage sinecures. But when you consider what is required of us, I think the means should be provided for maintaining our position in more ways than one. It would not matter to me, because, as an only daughter, it is incumbent on me to marry, and to extend the family connexion, and the first thing that we are made for is to fulfil our immediate obligations.\" Ph\u0153be said nothing to this, because she felt a little conscience-stricken.

But she had not been able to fully enter into such rea sons, far less to allow them to weigh with her for a single moment in her decision. Lady Dorothea proceeded with her lec ture more at ease. \" If Wriothesley should have a large fa mily of daughters, I do trust that the old provision will be revived for them, so that they need not all marry or starve upon a pittance. Don't you see in the newspapers, child, how spinster-daughters of peers come to grief, become bankrupt, and are the prey of dishonest foreigners ?

The peer's daughter ekes out her living by going the round of her more fortunate friends, living a month at this castle, and six weeks at that lodge. She is shown into the draughty7 bed-room, and set down in the worst seat at table.

I have no turn for dreary desolation, and I declare that, with any wit I have, I cannot see a variety of escapes for a girl who is not approachable and susceptible. I shall go while the impression is fresh upon me, and meet my lord for whom I am destined, with the coolness of a martyr, and without much will either of his or mine. If you can walk with me to the end of the Wooers' Alley with out any inconvenience,\" Lady Dorothea end ed, with a clinging to Ph\u0153be which was a slight departure from the coolness of a martyr, \" I should like it very much, as it may be the last occasion for ever so long.\""], [321, "An Unexpected Pleasure. 309 \" I will go with you as long and as far as you will let me, Lady Dorothea,\" Ph\u0153be an swered fervently. \" But if it is to keep Mrs. Paston from her tea-table, or Mr. Paston from his painting room, you must not think of it.

I stole a march upon Chetwynd, Dugdale and Bob Bertie, who both came yesterday7, and who are now out with Wrio thesley trying his new drag round by the great gateway. I did want to see you, and feel how innocent and eager and happy you are, and have you all to myself for once again, Ph\u0153be.\" Her ladyship wound up with another pressure of Ph\u0153be's hand.

In her progress through Wooers' Alley, she excited the never-failing interest which a bird of another hemisphere, alighting and sunning its rich snowydown and glossy raven plumage among the common silver-weed and sorrel of the wayside never fails to inspire in ordinary birds. Such customary notice Lady Dorothea- received with the unconsciousness of a queen. She had still a warning to give Ph\u0153be. \" You are to have the Edgecumbes with you this year as usual,\" remarked her lady ship. \" Yes, I understand so,\" said Ph\u0153be. \"Mrs. Edgecumbe, poor old soul, has had her troubles,\" whispered her ladyship, \" and she lived in an evil day.

Your father and mother, and another per son more nearly concerned, will look after you. The couple reached the pony carriage, but Lady Dorothea's confidences were not yet exhausted ; so, holding Ph\u0153be's hand in hers, she said \u2014 \" Good-bye, dear.
