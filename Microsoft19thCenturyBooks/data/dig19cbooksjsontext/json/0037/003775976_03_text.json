The anxious expression of Mynheer Kalm's face, as he perused a cautiously-worded letter from Mr. Joyce, urging him to come to England at once, would have been a capital study for a humorous painter. Since the loss of his beloved daughter, Mynheer had become so bewddered in his faculties, that the services of Kloots were in greater request than ever, when any difficulty arose. That worthy having received instructions that an audience would be granted him in the summer house, and rightly concluding that something of importance was to be discussed, was cautious that VOL.

He was too much accustomed to the sublime composure of his employer to expect any formal greeting ; and when Mynheer put Mr. Joyce's letter into his hand, he fuUy understood that he was to read it, and advise thereupon. Kloots read it through with great attention, and when he had finished, said, emphatically \u2014 \" I should think, Mynheer, you ought by all means to go.\" Mynheer looked vacantly at his retainer, as though not quite certain whether he had heard him distinctly ; but being assured, by the decided look of Kloots, he faintly queried \u2014 \" Steam ? \" \" Why, yes, Mynheer, you'd hardly choose to go in a sailing vessel in these days of quick travelling.\" The silence maintained for some time was a proof of the alarming effect the mention of"], [11, "MYNHEER KALM'S JOURNEY. 3 quick traveUing had upon Mynheer's mind. He objected, in the first place, to travelling of any kind, but quick travelling was his especial abomination. He had been up the Rhine, as the reader will remember, but that was an inland stream, the shores being everywhere visible, and the current, though rapid, was not turbulent enough to toss the vessel about; yet, even then, Mynheer thanked his stars most heartily when the business was over, and he was allowed to return in peace to his beloved summer-house. Had he not sworn never again to leave it till carried to his last resting-place ? Had he not, over a friendly meerschaum, invoked the sympathies of neighbour Vanderbeck, respecting the dangers of travelling ? He, who never felt himself safe upon water rougher than a mill dam, to venture upon the wild tempestuous ocean ! To mount upon billows, which ran sometimes as high as his own warehouse, and then to dive into those awful black hollows in the waves, which often swaUowed up big ships as easily as an elephant swallows up a child's biscuit."], [12, "4 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Then he objected to steamers, and never passed along the quays when they were hissing, groaning, sputtering, screaming, puffing, and snorting alongside, as though entering a violent protest against the tribulations they had just encountered, without wondering why sensible people ever trusted themselves in such disagreeable con veyances, and fully expected a tremendous explosion every day of his lHe. While cogitating how he could best escape some of these annoyances, and yet comply with Mr. Joyce's evidently earnest request, a happy idea occurred to him, and he murmured, almost with animation \u2014 \" Fishing Boat.\" \" They stand a deal of knocking about along shore, Mynheer, but sometimes when they put out to sea, a contrary wind carries them out of their course, and the poor fellows are half-starved before they can put into any harbour.\" Appalled by this picture, Mynheer then remembered another horror of the ocean, and whispered piteously to Kloots \u2014"], [13, "MYNHEER KALm's JOURNEY. 5 \" Sea sickness.\" \" Yes, Mynheer, that's not very pleasant to be sure ; but the best thing you can do will be to go to bed directly you get on board, and He with your feet toward tho bows of the ship, so that when she pitches, you will pitch with her.\" Mynheer reflected upon this delightful prospect with a long-drawn sigh, and giving Kloots, in the fewest possible words, some instructions, resigned himself to his fate. He was at his wit's end as to the errand which made Mr. Joyce write so earnestly, and wondered why that gentleman did not come over himself, a course which would have pleased him infinitely better than undertaking a sea voyage. He had never in his life ventured upon the ocean, holding as he did to the opinion, that those who go anywhere by water, when they can proceed by land, must be out of their senses. The only advantage of water carriage, he had yet discovered, was to float down his timber rafts from the Upper Rhine. Mynheer refreshed himseH with a tumbler of Schiedam, and invited his manager to follow"], [14, "6 LOST FOOTSTEPS, his example, which invitation Kloots availed himself of with such alacrity, that the stock of liquor in hand sensibly diminished in five minutes. \" I think, Mynheer, after all, this Httle trip will cheer you up, and do you good,\" said Kloots, consolingly. The groan which Mynheer gave sounded like nothing so little as assent, but Kloots continued \u2014 \"Mr. Joyce is a warm-hearted gentleman, and will be very glad to welcome you to England. What his important communication may be, I cannot guess ; probably about M. Morel.\" Kloots fancied Mynheer nodded acquiescence, but in fact he was nodding involuntardy, being so overcome by his reflections, that he had fallen into a profound slumber. \" It is strange, Mynheer,\" said Kloots, who generally got extremely loquacious after two or three glasses, \" very strange indeed, that M. Mor6l should have left Rotterdam so suddenly, without even calling upon you. I only discovered it by accident ; passing the Chateau, and finding"], [15, "MYNHEER KALM's JOURNEY. 7 it closed, I learned that they had aU gone, Madame Morel having been the first.\" Mynheer's only answer, was a sonorous snore, which Kloots, now becoming somewhat muddled, might have fancied was a murmur of assent. He filled his glass for, perhaps, the tenth time, and asked his master some direct question. There was no response, yet Mynheer's meerschaum emitted a graceful and continuous cloud of smoke, Mynheer's heavy breathing being sufficient to keep it alight. \" Ah, poor gentleman,\" sighed Kloots, sym patheticaUy, \"he has never been quite himself since we lost our darhng girl. What a sad thing to be sure, such a genius as he was, such miraculous faculties for making a good bargain. There's not his equal yonder, I do beheve,\" waving his hand in the direction of the city ; \" and the dear sweet girl she was, always so fuU of fun and merriment, always so kind, and good tempered ; and what a friend she was to my poor old mother.\""], [16, "8 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Kloots, with some genuine feeling creeping into his muddled brain, began sobbing aloud. That mysterious process which so frequently blends outwards sounds and scenes with our dreaming fancies, now associated the grief o* Kloots with some terrible vision of shipwreck and disaster in Mynheer's brain, and with a sudden cry of alarm, he feU forward upon the floor of the summer-house, upsetting the glasses upon the table, and what, in Kloofs mind, was more disastrous, every drop of the liquor. But he flew manfully to the rescue ; the lamp had been knocked down by Mynheer's faU, and they were in complete darkness. The unfortunate gentleman, probably in his fright, imagining that he was at the bottom of the sea, groaned heavUy, and gave himseH up for lost. Kloots did not lose his presence of mind, but tinkled the Httle beU, and assistance speedUy came, for he found himseH quite unable to raise the portly form of his master. A light being procured, Mynheer saw how the case stood, and for the first time in his Hfe, Kloots heard from his"], [17, "MYNHEER KALm's JOURNEY. 9 tacitern employer a hearty laugh, a laugh as loud as it was long, a genuine side-holding roof echoing guffaw, which made the rafters of the summer-house ring again, and the very floor tremble beneath their feet. \" Come, that's right, Mynheer,\" said Kloots, joyously,\" \" that's a noble beginning for your voyage ; and do you set off while you are in the mind. I'll go at once and assist in the packing up.' The vessel was about to sail in three hours from that time, but Mynheer had been so disquieted, that he had made no attempt to prepare for his journey. The active co-operation of Kloots, however, soon animated the household, and in ample time he saw his beloved master safely on board, and tucked up in his cabin, with his feet toward the head of the vessel. The sea was smooth, and the wind was fair, and though Mynheer was as qualmish as a gentleman of his inches might be expected to be, who had never before traversed the ocean, he bore the voyage extremely well, and never quitted his cabin till the steamer reached London."], [18, "10 LOST FOOTSTEPS. He had forgotten, in his bewilderment, to write to Mr. Joyce, or that gentleman would have met him upon his arrival. The consequence was, the poor gentleman came upon deck in the midst of all the noise and hurly-burly, and, distracted by the confusion, gave himself up an easy prey to the first assadant. This was a cabman, of a genius so remarkable, that he had been known to compass a journey of four miles in his endeavours to reach the Mansion House, after a fair start from London Bridge. Seeing Mynheer, this extraordinary man took a benevolent interest in him at once, and without delay, hustled him into the cab, and conveyed him at a steady pace in the direction of Holloway. When they had reached Highbury, Mynheer, thinking he could not do better than give the driver some information, caUed out suddenly, in good EngHsh \u2014 \" London Bridge.\" He remembered that as one of the stations of the South Eastern RaUway, but the driver was"], [19, "MYNHEER KALm's JOURNEY. 11 far too astute to turn immediately back. By turning out of the main road, and winding through a labyrinth of little streets, he finally reached the station, after a drive of three hours. Mynheer was of a placid temperameut. He had dropped into a most refreshing sleep, after giving the word to his driver, and, being aroused by the enquiry of the porter as to his luggage, was reminded that it was still lying on the deck of the steamer. But Mynheer wanted his dinner, and having paid the cabman three times his fare, and accepted the offer of the obHging official to telegraph for the luggage, Mynheer sat down to a cosy dinner at the hotel, as little disturbed in his expression by the loss of time, as an Egyptian Sphinx might have been by the rising of the Nile."], [20, "CHAPTER II.

He paid a fareweU visit to Molton , and was calling upon Mr. Joyce. Entering the room without ceremony, as he had been accustomed to do, he found his friend looking so intently at a portrait, that he did not perceive Adrian's approach. \" What a lovely face, Mr. Joyce,\" Adrian said, \" I wonder you have never shown me that before.\" \" I never show it to anybody, Adrian, nor would you have seen it now, but by accident. You have sometimes wondered, I dare say, why, with vigorous health, an ample fortune, and the society of cultivated friends, I am at times"], [21, "13 the story of a picture. very sad. This portrait is the answer, for it recalls the lost happiness of my youth. \" Not that I believe youth is the only time for happiness. Middle Hfe has its calm pleasures, and even age is endurable when not accompanied with too many aches and pains. I should be happy enough still, but for this one sad recollec tion. There was a moment in my life, Adrian, when it seemed that the decision of a second might have changed my fate for the rest of my days, and the remembrance of it must always be very painful to me. I will tell you how it was. \" Few men had fairer promises of happiness in youth than myself. I had been educated for the bar, but the death of a wealthy relative, shortly after I came of age, left me master of a pretty estate on the coast of Norfolk. There was a fine old house, surrounded by majestic woods, and with glorious views of the sea. In the height of summer, perhaps, when the rooms were darkened by the shadow of the woods, some might have called it gloomy, but it was endeared to me by many chddish associations. It was there, too, I"], [22, "14 LOST FOOTSTEPS. had met the sweet girl who was to have been my wife. If this portrait be not an absolute blunder, you see a nature most keenly susceptible to pleasure or pain, more exquisitely aHve to external influences than any woman I have ever met. It was this very sensitiveness which sometimes alarmed me, but I had a confident hope that it would decrease with time. My whole thoughts were devoted to her, and I beheve she loved me with her whole heart ; yet there were moments when her easy gaiety would suddenly vanish without any apparent cause ; when music, which was a passion with her, would fad to interest her, and she would seem utterly careless and indifferent to everything. She could evidently give no reason for these sudden fits of depression. \" Some friends from London had promised me a visit, and many plans were made for their amuse ment, amongst other things, an archery fete, which Clara entered into most heartily, and from having been extremely sad for a day or two, she became quite happy and cheerful again, in anticipation. It was the autumn, but the weather"], [23, "15 THE STORY OF A PICTURE. was clear and delightful. Our friends came, and never was there a merrier lunch than we had on the lawn the day after their arrival. Clara entered with the most evident enjoyment into the festivities ; and, catching the infection of her joyous mirth, the place echoed with laughter every moment. If a pause occurred, somebody immediately thrummed a guitar, or the sound of the piano came from an open window, or a glee or part song was chanted with boisterous applause. Then came the archery fete in the afternoon. \" A score of lovely girls came, dressed in coquettish fashion, with arrows, more likely to wound their tender-hearted swains than hit the bull's eye ; then a merry quadrille took place; and when they began to be weary, Clara proposed a game of forfeits. She was a little jealous when, in the course of the game, I had to kiss the prettiest girl, except herself, for blundering, and promised a severe sentence when it next came to my turn to pay forfeit. \" This happened very soon, and Clara said \u2014"], [24, "16 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \" ' Now he shall go into the library and wait till he sees a ghost.' \" You should have heard the peals of laughter that foUowed this suggestion. The bare absurdity, as it seemed, to expect a phantom upon a calm, clear October afternoon, with the mellow sunshine streaming over th-3 russet woods, and glittering upon the sea ; it was the quaintest idea imaginable. \" 'I am afraid, ladies, that I shall leave your pleasant society for some time,' I said, ' unless some fair damsel will become a ghost for the moment.' \u2022\"No, that we won't,' cried Clara, ' there must be plenty of ghosts in an old place like this. Of course there is a mystery or romance of some kind that has never been discovered.' \" ' But phantoms don't promenade in the day light, Clara,' said I dolefully. \"However, my tormentors insisted upon the forfeit being paid, and I went off to the library to pacify them. It was on the side of the house opposite to that where my visitors were assembled,"], [25, "17 THE STORY OF A PICTURE. and the approach was through a long and some what gloomy corridor, almost dark abeady, though comparatively early in the afternoon. \" When the door of the library closed upon me, there was almost a complete silence, save but the echo of the waves upon the beach, and the gentle murmur of the wind in the lofty trees near the house. I could not hear a sound of the merry makers I had so lately quitted, and the stillness was by contrast somewhat saddening. \" Before I had been many seconds in the library, I became conscious of a feeling of appre hension, which I could not by any means account for. It was in vain that I peered into every corner of the lonely room, there was nothing un usual in its appearance ; besides, it was still day light, my friends close at hand, the house famUiar to me from childhood ; every book upon the shelves had the aspect of an old friend.

The heavy blind was hanging a Httle aside, too, just as I had drawn it on the previous day to get a Httle more light at dusk. \" The room was the worst lighted in the house, but was the quietest, and there was a solitary path way leading over the cliff down to the sea, within a yard or two of the window, which was a delightful place in the summer. Impatient of my captivity, and anxious to shake off the uneasy impression which fastened upon me, I walked to the window, haH suspecting, half hoping some fair visitor was coming to play the part of phantom, and release me, and I vowed inwardly to make her pay for her presumption. \" I had reached the casement, haH incHned to jump out, when a slight rustling, and a gleam as of some white object in the distance attracted me. I, at first, thought that one of the young ladies was hiding behind a tree to play me a trick, and carry out the joke, and raised my foot Hghtly to the window, intending to give chase, when I felt myself suddenly rooted to the spot, as though an"], [27, "19 THE STORY OF A PICTURE. invisible chain had been flung around me. I became irresolute, and incapable of exercising the slightest power of the wdl. \" I was vividly reminded of the extraordinary feelings I then experienced by reading the other day a passage in ' MoreU's Psychology,' where he speaks of a state of the mind, consisting of a succession of separate impressions, each separate sensation Hke a momentary Hfe and death of the individual being, and depriving the soul of seH consiousness, tiU this chaos of impressions clustered round a central or uniting point.

A string had broken, and, perhaps, explained her absence, and after waiting a few moments, some one went into the house to seek her. I should have gone myself, but concluded, without doubt, she must be indoors, and at the same moment an old schooHeUow, to whom I had scarcely spoken as yet, came up, and Unking his arm in mine, began to chat of old days we had spent together. \" ' Don't be so anxious about the young lady,' he said, merrdy, 'they will be sure to take care of her.

No one had seen her since she sang the ballad to the harp upon the lawn.

We were too bewildered for some time to take any decisive step, but wandered aimlessly seeking her, hour after hour. Nobody dined that day, and it was midnight before we thought of seeking along the shore. \" Then, with lanterns, we walked about tdl day break, hearing only the low moan of the waves, and seeing only the white foam of the breakers, with, sometimes, a twinkHng light on the deck of some fishing boat. \" I cross-questioned each visitor with passionate anxiety, but there was not one among them who had heard from Clara, or seen anything in her manner, indicating any change from her usual habits. All agreed in saying that they had never seen her so happy and cheerful as she had been up to the moment of her extraordinary dis appearance. Her health, too, had been unusuaUy good previously. There was nothing to be done,"], [33, "25 THE STORY OF A PICTURE. but to continue the weary task of searching for her \u2014 a task in which the villagers joined heartUy, for Clara was known and beloved by every inhabi tant of the place, and with genial familiarity, was more often, than not, caUed by her christian name. \" For miles, in every direction, friends and neighbours continued the search through the foUowing day, when at night, a rough, honest boatman came up to the house, his face showing too plainly his sympathy. For a moment I was calmer than he. I had yet to learn the blank horror of the story he would have to tell me. With much difficulty, and with an evident desire to spare me, his simple tale was at length told. He had been out fishing, with his mates, for some hours, and they had caught nothing, when at length the net was dragged by an unusual weight, and his comrades began to puU with great alacrity, thinking they had met with a great haul of fish.

There was a rude stall for art there also, and copies of Crucifixions and Holy famihes hung in company with the hero of Austerlitz. Nor was it difficult to say which claimed the greatest admiration from the crowd, the Saviour or the Destroyer, for it was at the time when the popularity of Louis PhiHppe was on the wane, and men, some of whom had fought in the Grand Army, looked back regret fuUy to that day so fuU of glory and then so fuU of despair for France.

In truth, a strange face was a rarity at the time of the year. Many Enghsh came there in the height of summer, for the scenery was lovely and the Hving very cheap ; but there had been a pro found disquietude in the capital, and every stranger was looked upon as a spy watching the course of events on behaff of the government. The feeling growing up in the minds of the popu lation was not unlike what is taking place at the present moment. It was a pause before a possible storm \u2014 a storm which might easily have been averted if those in power had not been blinded by selfishness and luUed into security by a behef in majorities, forts, and troops \u2014 majorities which proved nothing, and advanced nothing \u2014 forts which might at any moment serve to imprison their defenders, and troops who were secretly fuU of sympathy with the popular ideas, and conscious also how Httle glory there was to be gained in a contest with their feUow-countrymen.

There was growing in France, and it wiU perhaps never more be eradicated, a feehng of impatience against the insolence of authority and ready sympathy for those compelled to yield to it. It may be that the daUy increasing import ance of the American RepubHc, or a fuUer know ledge of our English freedom, had something to do with this altered tone in the masses of the people, and discussions were frequent when any action of the government savoured of restraint.

Neither side would Hsten to compromise, and the more cla morous the populace became, the more rigid was the attitude of the ministers. Then as now, the right to meet freely and debate public questions was discussed with the greatest bitterness; and each man, feeling that his claim to be heard upon topics that imme diately concerned him was in jeopardy, was determined to make a stand upon this point H upon no other. It was at this juncture that the French ministry of the day made fatal blunders, and it was plainly seen by those who understood the popular feeling, what the end must be. The street vagrants who broke lamps and demohshed shop windows for the sake of plunder \u2014 the reckless and impoverished, who would merely welcome an outbreak for the chance of a drunken orgie, began to speculate upon their harvest : but they were not alone.

Adrian spent his time at first in sketching and wandering, without any direct aim, from one quaint old town to another; but everywhere was the same stagnation of aU business, the same pre-occupation in men's minds. Rumours came flying from Paris that an outbreak was imminent, and some of the bolder spirits from the provinces went up to the capital, partly from curiosity, partly, perhaps, to join in some of the secret societies which were estabhshing to defy the government and bring about a new order of things.

The prevalent idea was a republic, and it was thought by the more ardent and enthusiastic minds, that a republic would find a sufficient number of men, prepared and qualified to carry on the government so as to inspire confidence in the people, and present a dignified attitude in the eyes of other nations. Anxious to watch the progress of a movement so different from anything that had taken place in his own land for a couple of centuries, Adrian could not resist the temptation to go to Paris. He had fallen in with a young French artist, M. Maurice Vaissier, who was brimming with antipathies against the ruling powers. He was an accomphshed young man of good family, and spoke Enghsh with the greatest fluency. He had read all our great authors, understood the principles of English government, and having conceived a warm admiration for Adrian's abilities, strongly urged him to Paris, as the only place in France for a young artist. It was a critical time for France when the young men reached the capital. The ministry 3 VOL. III."], [42, "34 LOST FOOTSTEPS. had been dismissed as a concession to popular feeling, and for the moment there was a calm, but a calm with which nobody was satisfied, and which could not possibly continue. Suddenly, when expectation was on the tiptoe for the next move, the National Guards fraternised with the people, and in many cases aUowed themselves to be disarmed by their countrymen without the slightest resistance. The Comte Mole, who had been deputed by the king to form a new ministry, had also signally failed. Marshal Bugeaud, in command of the French troops in Paris, protesting against certain orders, resigned his' command ; his officers became disaffected, and whole regiments allowed the mob to possess themselves of arms and ammunition. By this movement an irregular but very for midable army of nearly twenty thousand men obtained possession of the Parisian streets, most of which were then extremely narrow and crooked, and favourable to the kind of warfare attempted. Barricades of omnibuses, ladders, barrows, planks, paving stones, and even articles"], [43, "35 IN PARIS. of furniture speedily arose in quarters capable of active defence, and in some cases there had been actual conflicts between those of the troops who remained firm to the government and the people. A sharp struggle had taken place at the Palais Royal between the people and one of the line regiments in charge of the state apart ments, in which Adrian's new friend bore a prominent part. Heading a party in the defence of a barricade he came back to Adrian, laughing merrily at the exploit as only a Frenchman can, and immediately joined another expedition bound for the TuUeries to demand the abdication of the king, who had been advised to give place to his grandson, the Count de Paris. Everything, however, was too late for the unfortunate monarch, who had neither the time nor the calmness of mind necessary to combat such difficulties as now beset him. Bewddered, despairing, he learned that the troops had given way to the people. The TuUeries was at the"], [44, "36 LOST FOOTSTEPS. mercy of the mob, and he signed with a sense of relief the act of abdication, proposed to him by Emile de Girardin. Excited by the extraordinary events which were taking place, Adrian followed his young friend from one post to another Hke one in a dream. In more than one instance he would have met with rough usage, had it not been for his companion, who, with a simple password which acted as a tahsman wherever they went, soon restored the good humour of the mob. They had reached the Chamber of Deputies, where the abdication of the king was being discussed amid cries of \" Vive la Repubhque,\" the crowd without becoming each moment more violent. Suddenly, as by an invisible impulse, the vast concourse moved forward, and Adrian was literally carried into the Chamber. Groups of men, some dressed in the ordinary blouse, some with dilapidated coats hanging in rags from their shoulders, some with dragoon's helmets on their heads, but all with some kind of weapon in their"], [45, "37 IN PARIS. hands, muskets, spears, swords, and flourishing the tricoloured flag. With a hearty cheer for Maurice Vaissier, they hoisted him into a seat lately occupied by one of the deputies, and called upon the President to propose a republic. Unawed by this demonstration, the President calmly put on his hat, and was about to move from his place, but the uproar then became terrific, and not a voice could be distinguished for some seconds, untd Ledru Rollin, making himseH audible by the aid of his magnificent voice, cried out \" Gentlemen, \u2014 In the name of the people I demand silence. A government has been pro posed to you, against which I protest. You have already been fighting for two days, and, H necessary, you will continue the struggle \" The shouts of applause were tremendous ; arms were brandished, and caps thrown into the air, when Lamartine rose calmly and spoke. His dignified manner silenced the crowd, and they listened with respect. He spoke with regret of the blood which had been shed, and of"], [46, "38 LOST FOOTSTEPS. his desire, first of all, to put a stop to civU war. He then proposed a provisional government, which should take upon itself the task of appealing to the country, and thus establishing a form of government based upon the popular wiU. There was thundering applause at the conclu sion of this speech among the more moderate ; but fierce passions had been aroused, and were not so easily quelled. WhUe Adrian listened with eagerness to the proceedings, Maurice touched him on the shoulder, and made a sign for him to follow. Immediately they left the chamber they were foUowed by a considerable number of the armed crowd, who had, it seemed, chosen Maurice Vaissier as a leader. Following him quickly through the narrow, winding streets, they c.ame to a spot where preparations were evidently being made to resist an attack. Blinds were drawn down, doors barricaded, the stones from the roadway pUed in heaps, while a quantity of scaffold poles from a neighbouring building"], [47, "39 IN PARIS. were hastily fastened together to blookade the street. \"Here I may close my life,\" said Maurice Vaissier, with a steady look at Adrian. \" Why, then, have you come here ? \" was the answer. \" Could you not as easily have turned in another direction ? \" \" It is my destiny ; but, come, you must want some refreshment by this time.\" Giving a signal to a man armed to the teeth, who was guarding a door near them, they entered, and found a plen tiful meal ready for them. Excited by the peculiar behaviour of his companion, Adrian could not eat much, and his ear caught ominous sounds occasionaUy. Maurice listened to these sounds from time to time, and once, when they sounded nearer, took up a gun that stood near him, and examined it. \" There is no need for you to brave danger, my friend ; it is not your cause, but for France some must fall, and I may be one of them. May I ask a favour of you ? \" \" Certainly,\" was Adrian's reply."], [48, "40 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \" If it should be that I fall, you wdl give this letter at the address upon the envelope. I would not trust it to the post, for special reasons. Promise me, will you ? \" Adrian took the letter, and gave the promise, wondering greatly why this young, gaUant fellow should heedlessly sacrifice himself, especially as it seemed that the government was giving way, and that a Httle patience on the part of the people would secure their desires. In another moment shouts were heard in the street beneath them, and looking out of the window, Adrian saw that the street, which half an-hour before appeared so deserted and silent, was alive with human beings. Every window, every door, every roof, was occupied by men, armed, and resolute. Maurice addressed a few words to them, which were received with a cheer, and then, taking his gun, he shook hands with Adrian as one who parts for the last time, and mounted the barricade to give the signal. For a moment Adrian saw the active figure"], [49, "41 IN PARIS. glance over the pUed up heap of the barricade. Then there was a cry of \"Vive la Repubhque,\" then a hundred guns were levelled through openings of the barricade, and through windows, and downward from the lofty roofs. There was a clatter of glass, and a thousand echoes dying away amid the smoke, and then for a moment a dead silence. \" Again,\" shouted Maurice, and guns were reloaded with the greatest rapidity, but in the interval the fire was returned. A volley came crashing into the barricade. There were shouts and cries of pain, mingled with execrations. Maurice raised his cap with an air of defiance, and caUed upon his companions to fire quickly. In a second more he fell back, fatally wounded. Adrian rushed from the house and lifted him from the ground. He smiled, and faintly shook his head, but spoke not a word ; and before Adrian, haH carrying, half dragging him, had reached the house, he was dead. At the same moment the attacking party had reached the barricade, and some of the soldiers,"], [50, "42 LOST FOOTSTEPS. climbing nimbly over, made a vigorous onslaught upon the defenders. Adrian, unarmed, and embarrassed with the corpse of his friend, could make no resistance, nor could he escape. A group near him, seeing his position, threw themselves upon the soldiers like fiends, and forced them back, until he had reached the house. Many of the crowd followed him, and defended the house against the troops ; who, however, having thrown down the barricade, seemed unwiUing to prolong the contest, and passed out of the street. Once more there was sdence, and then Adrian, for the first time, felt faint and in pain. He had received a bullet in the left arm from which the blood was flowing freely. The people of the house were extremely kind to him. A surgeon was called, who, examining the wound, found that it was not serious, and by the next morning he was able to fulfil the sad office imposed by his promise the day before."], [51, "CHAPTER IV. A Fatal Meeting. After two or three very exciting days Paris soon became tranquil again. The feeling of the great mass of the people was so strong in one direction as to render the office of those who had been chosen leaders of the movement compara tively easy. The struggle in which the gallant young Vaissier fell had been a rash attempt to re vive the idea of a Legitimist party but had signally failed, as might have been foreseen from the first. The young painter, a descendant of an old family in Brittany, which had for half a century Hved in protest against Napoleonic influence, had come up to Paris filled with the ideas he had imbibed from childhood, and had conceived it possible, in the stormy events likely to take place, that he mis^ht find a circle willing to carry out his views."], [52, "44 LOST FOOTSTEPS. At first he met with some success; for in the agitated state of the public mind every shade of opinion had its representatives. A compact little body of adherents raUied round him, and, full of passionate aspiration, the young man flung him seH into the conflict without a thought of conse quences. But when the general pubhc declared so strongly against their cause, young Vaissier soon saw a thinning of his ranks, and when the actual struggle took place perhaps scarcely two hundred really supported his direct purpose, the remainder consisting mainly of those reckless spirits who are always so plentiful in Paris when an outbreak is Hkely, and whose patriotism has about as much foundation as their pohtics, mean ing little more than a sharp look out for plunder. With a last look at the noble features of the dead young painter, Adrian left him to the care of the people, and with his note and dying message to his family started for Brittany. Adrian had, upon two or three occasions when staying in Brittany, visited young Vaissier's home, and, charmed with its picturesque situation,"], [53, "A FATAL MEETING. 45 had carefully painted it in water colours. It was a strange, fantastic old place \u2014 half mansion, half fortress, half farmhouse ; rude antique towers being blended with overhanging gables, where innumerable birds had built their nests under the eaves. The inhabited portion of the house was fuU of long dark passages and sombre rooms, wainscoted with oak, and the front of the building looked out upon a kind of courtyard, now used as a farmyard. Nothing could be seen from the windows but the walls and outbuildings, yet it was situated in the heart of most romantic scenery. Almost under the very walls ran a swift river, so deep down beneath the overhanging rocks that it was scarcely audible, but a Httle lower down the stream there were pleasant cornfields and verdant meadows, in the midst of which stood a ruined monastery which was near to the road leading to the house. Fatigued with his journey, for there was no conveyance nearer than five or six miles, Adrian sat down in the shadow of the monastery to rest."], [54, "46 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Though but the first week in March the sun was shining brilliantly, and threw long fantastic shadows from the broken sculpture and ruined arches of the building. The roof had faUen cen turies before, and the bare waUs stood open to the sky. A gentle wind whispered tremulously through the crevices and waved the clinging ivy that clustered round the hoary walls. The silence was so great and soothing that Adrian, who had passed a sleepless .night, involuntardy dropped into a slumber and had a most extraordinary dream. Upon an antique tomb, which yet remained entire, was carved a female figure in a recumbent attitude, with hands crossed and eyes raised to heaven. Was it fancy merely? It seemed to Adrian in his dream that the figure suddenly became Hke his beloved Louise. The likeness grew more and more vivid each instant, and he could almost believe that it moved, and that a wild cry of distress was uttered at some great distance. Greatly excited by it Adrian awoke with a feeling of horror, and looked about him, but the"], [55, "47 A FATAL MEETING. place was as silent as ever. There was the same rustHng of the wind \u2014 the same fantastic shadows \u2014 the same quiet figure upon the antique tomb. There was not an echo of any human footstep or sound of human voice, and Adrian, persuaded that it was merely an excited fancy, rose sadly to pursue his journey. As he stepped into the dusky glen leading to the home of the Vaissier family, he listened with a sort of shudder for which he could not account to the brawling of the swift stream beneath, and he felt oppressed and lonely as he gazed at the taU crags overhanging the stream, though he knew it could not be many minutes ere he reached the houso where, though the bearer of such me lancholy intelligence, he was sure of a welcome for himseH, as indeed the Enghsh are in aU the provinces of France. The scenes he had witnessed in the capital had rendered Adrian's ear preternaturally acute, and he was certain when he again turned into the road leading to his destination that he heard a foot step at a considerable distance."], [56, "48 LOST FOOTSTEPS. It was stealthy and peculiar \u2014 sometimes stop ping suddenly, then advancing at a very rapid pace. Adrian was entirely unarmed, and remembering the excited state of the country thought it better to hurry forward. He, however, Hstened for a few seconds without detecting the slightest sound, and concluded that the traveller, whether his intentions had been evU or not, must have taken another direction. He kept on till he had reached the rude wooden bridge that spanned the narrow ravine at a dizzy height above the roaring waters \u2014 so far, indeed, that the rays of the declining sun did not pene trate to the torrent. High as the bridge stood above the stream, however, its force, swoUen as it was with winter floods and melting snows, made the rude framework shake and tremble. Adrian knew there was no danger for a single passenger, for he had seen cattle and loads of hay and corn pass over it. Why, then, he asked himseH, should he hesitate to cross it as though it was likely to give way beneath his weight ?"], [57, "49 A FATAL MEETING. He paused irresolutely ere he stepped upon the bridge, and again he heard (and now he fancied it must be nearer) the same peculiar stealthy foot step he had heard before. But immediately he listened it stopped again, and Adrian, ready to smile at his own weakness, stepped upon the bridge and had nearly crossed it when he paused for a moment to look at an open ing in the rocks, through which one window of the chateau was visible. He had cause enough to remember that tiny casement. How often, for years after, in quiet hours of retirement, in day dreams, in the midst of artistic labours, even in his very dreams, did that soHtary window seem to flash before him, as he saw it lighted up for a moment with the deep glow of the sun, which, in the glen where he stood, was no longer visible. He stood still a moment upon the end of the bridge, fascinated ; gazing, with the eye of a painter, upon a scene which was pecuhar and novel. He looked down into the dark space beneath him, heard but could not see the raging VOL.

Now, in reahty, there were footsteps ap proaching him rapidly, but the noise of the waters drowned them completely. It was only when Adrian roused himseH to leave the spot that he perceived a tall figure standing like a shadow beside him. He felt a vigorous grip upon his shoulder as he turned, and, with a suppressed cry of alarm, saw in the dim light that his companion was M. Morel. His first thought was of Louise, as the strange dream he had had flashed upon his mind, coupled with the equally strange appearance of M. Morel in such an unexpected place. He forgot for the time the state of mind in which he had left her husband, and remembered her only. She was ill \u2014 perhaps dying \u2014 perhaps, even, dead \u2014 and had sent in her last moments, some message of affection and confidence with which she dared not trust herseH -when living."], [59, "51 A FATAL MEETING. But why by M. Morel ? was his next thought. Had her husband recovered his faculties? He looked fuU of health and vigour, but Adrian perceived, in a second glance, the same wUd Hght in the eyes \u2014 the same fierce, animal gaze, which had so often appaUed him. Adrian, recovering his presence of mind, put several questions rapidly to his companion, but they received no answer ; and he was about to move from the spot where he stood, thinking it a wise precaution, considering M. Morel's state of mind. Perhaps the strange situation in which they were placed suggested to the broken mind of M. Morel some violent idea, for he effectuaUy prevented Adrian moving one step further. Once, when Adrian attempted to pass him, he muttered some incoherent words, and threw up his arms. Not wishing to irritate him, Adrian gave way, and leaned for a moment against the rails of the bridge. The next instant he felt himself forced upon this frail support, which cracked and quivered"], [60, "52 LOST FOOTSTEPS. with the strain, and promised speedily to give way and precipitate them into the gulf below. Explanation there was none \u2014 resistance scarcely any, for Adrian's arms were held as though in a vice. Struggling, however, for the purpose of saving his own life, he freed one arm, and gave his antagonist a sudden blow with the hope of forcing him to relinquish his hold. Infuriated by this, M. Morel renewed his attack with the utmost violence. It became a death struggle in which it seemed very probable that the physical strength of the madman might prevail; but the rail of the bridge gave way beneath a fierce lunge, and Adrian saw with horror the form of M. Morel fall backward over the bridge and disappear. There was no cry for help, nor could any help have reached him. In vain did Adrian make a wild attempt to reach him by climbing over the frail bridge, and leaping upon some of the sHppery masses of rock, constantly wetted with the spray. The furious torrent must have carried M. Morel beyond the reach of human aid in an instant."], [61, "A FATAL MEETING. 53 The incident had occupied but a few seconds, and its suddenness so overwhelmed Adrian that he was totaUy unable to consider calmly what was to be done for some time. At length, remembering how near help was, he made for the chateau with breathless haste, but was met before he reached the house by some of the farm people, who had seen him there in company with Vaissier, and recognised him at once. Through the cleft in the rock the scene had been witnessed by one of the servants, and it was through the alarm she had given that assistance was coming to the spot. When, however, Adrian, with great haste and agitation, related what had taken place, he observed an air of suspicion in the faces of the men. It was evident from their glances they thought it possible that a crime had been com mitted, and with looks of evident distrust they escorted him to the house. They were five or six in number, and two of them walked behind Adrian, apparently to prevent his escape. When he anxiously enquired why they did not search"], [62, "54 LOST FOOTSTEPS. for M. Morel, he was answered merely with a shrug of the shoulders, and one of them with an ominous look said, \" He will be found, my friend, perhaps, sooner than you wish or expect.\""], [63, "CHAPTER V.

As for Cecily, what shall we say ? Simply that she was femininely human, and, being so, found it extremely difficult to resist such unreserved admiration as Edie bestowed upon her. When she watched him daily becoming more earnest in his art, and graduaUy discarding the thousand little vulgarities of speech and manner which are insensibly caught up by the careless man-about-"], [69, "61 UZELLI HOODWINKED. town, she found herself asking almost uncon sciously whether aU this might not be the result of genuine affection for herseH. From this consideration she began naturaUy to discuss Edie's personal merits, and found a great deal to be argued in his favour. He was young, fairly accomplished, and undeniably clever when he chose to apply himsolf, and of late he had, as even UzelH admitted, worked very hard. A picture he had lately painted would have excited Uzelli's warmest admiration, had not Cecily herseH been obviously chosen as the model of the heroine, at which UzelH had frowned terribly, as much from latent artistic jealousy, as from the fear that Cecily would ultimately be caught in the toils of matrimony. He did not beheve in marriage. \" Scolding de servant, and nursing de baby, zere is an end to art,\" said UzeUi.

There being no excuse for any further delay, the pair started, and, reaching Hampstead, wan dered into some of the pleasant lanes, Uzelli sometimes sitting down upon a bank to make a rude sketch or puff another cigar. Edie had caUed at Fitzroy Square within a few minutes after they had quitted it, but was very undecided as to his course when he learned in what direction they had gone. Cecily had given him no positive encouragement, and UzeUi would be certain to resent the intrusion. He had discussed the matter with Arthur Joyce, who had been with him to breakfast after a carouse on the previous evening ; but the advice of that flippant young gentleman was not nearly so palateable as formerly. Edie was so thoroughly head over ears that he could not tolerate Arthur's slangey allusions to courtship, love, and marriage. Arthur's summary proposition to \" go in and win right off,\" was rejected as barely feasible in the present stage,"], [71, "63 UZELLI HOODWINKED. and he went off to Fitzroy Square in a somewhat melancholy mood, increased when he learned that the adored one had left the house but five minutes before. It was one of those haH-a-dozen days which Wordsworth has immortalized for their peculiar charm, coming as they do so cheeringly after the gloom and cold of the winter, but the most spiritual nature cannot always be in harmony with nature. Edie was thinking more of Cecily's blue eyes than the ethereal blue of the sky, and he would rather have listened to her Hghtest whisper, than to the sighing of the gentle wind. He hesitated two minutes, then made for Hamp stead himself with all possible speed, spending all his loose silver upon the first Hansom that came up, and urging the driver as though it had been a case of life or death. The consequence was that Edie had the pleasure of seeing UzelH and Cecily alight from the slower. going omnibus, and walk gently through the town,"], [72, "64 LOST FOOTSTEPS. but it was at least an hour before he ventured very near them. It was part of his policy to catch Cecily alone in the first place ; and after waiting and watching for a long time, he saw at length her beautiful figure through an opening in a hedge, at some distance from the professor, and beyond his hearing. She came to a stile that separated one field from another, and stood up it to take a more extensive view. It was a charming landscape, though Edie at the moment had no eyes for that, but leaped forward joyously to greet her, and as suddenly checked himseH. \" Perhaps,\" he thought, \" I had better go in a contrary direction. I feel haH ashamed of my weakness in following her Hke this, when she evidently doesn't care a button for me.\" But when Cecdy, with a pretty movement, raised her hand to shade her eyes he felt a positive pain in his heart, from jealousy, believing, as he did, that she was looking for someone else."], [73, "65 UZELLI HOODWINKED. All the time he had slowly walked on, and had got quite close to her; so close, indeed, that Cecily saw him before he intended, and received him pleasantly enough, but with a certain restraint which the young mau inter preted unfavourably. There they stood, face to face, her eyes looking into his with the prettiest expression of wonder possible, or, at least, a very good imitation of it.

Still the conversation flagged. Jack hoped Ce. ily was quite well, and Cecily replied that she was. Then he said that she was unusually sdent, at wliich Cecily expressed surprise.

Then she blushed the faintest shade deeper than the rose on her lovely cheeks, and Edie came out with a stream of eloquence which did not surprise Cecily half so much as the orator who uttered it, for Cecdy had become quite well used to pretty compliments and soft nothings. \" Ah, if I only dared to say,\" murmured Jack, at the conclusion of his speech. \" Then let me be your father-confessor,\" said Cecily gaily, \" and you may be assured I will keep the secret.\" \"I fear you are disposed to ridicule me,\" said the sensitive young man, \" for you cannot be ignorant of my real feelings.\" There was a graver look in Cecily's face, and had Edie been less in earnest his suspense might have quickly ended. \" If you have any hope for me, for heaven's sake do not withhold it,\" said Edie, in tones rendered almost inaudible by emotion. Cecily was taken by surprise. She had only that morning begun to think seriously whether"], [76, "68 LOST FOOTSTEPS. she loved Jack a little, or not, and here he was going at express speed to the point. At this instant the gruff, husky voice of the professor was heard in the distance calling \" Ceesely ! Ceesely ! vere is got my lose ? \" Cecily gave a little nervous laugh at the oddity of the situation, which, Edie mistaking, made him so disgusted, that, leaping the stile, he struck across the field at no measured pace, cursing her in his heart as a mere flirt. Before he reached the opposite side of the meadow he heard a sweet voice calling him back. It was Cecily, breathless with haste and agitation. \"Do not think, Mr. Edie, that I am wanting in respect to you, but my dear friend will hardly trust me out of his sight. I was obliged to pacify him by running back a moment.\" \" Then you don't utterly despise me,\" cried Edie eagerly, \" you will give me a chance of proving how deep and true my devotion is.\" Say what you will, hardened man of the"], [77, "69 UZELLI HOODWINKED. world, in ridicule of the glorious enchantment, the rapturous delight of youthful love.

Jack would not face the professor just yet, he was too full of happiness to be able to endure some curt or caustic remark from UzeUi. He turned back to London, on foot this time, for he had expended his loose sUver in the journey there, and cash was not very plentiful yet with Edie.

He felt how much courage, firmness, and deter mination it would require to make up for the time and .opportunities he had lost ; but he was not dispirited.

After the usual salutations, a scolding from the old gentleman as to the remoteness of his last visit, and a solemn warning upon religious matters, Jack began his special business. \"I have been seriously thinking, father.\" \"You have ! well, I'm glad of that, and it's quite time you did. The Reverend Josiah is very anxious about your spiritual welfare.\" \" It was not exactly about my spiritual welfare I came to speak,\" Jack said dubiously. \" Ah, indeed ! but I might have expected as much.

Mr. Edie took no notice of his son's retort ; but began to ply him with a sort of matri monial catechism. \"Do you suppose you know anything of the feminine character ? \" enquired the old gentleman. Jack hoped so. In his secret heart he rather prided himself upon his experience of that kind. \" One of the few sensible Hnes of poetry that I remember,\" said his father, \"is that about women, ' Uncertain, coy, and hard to please. \"But you leave out the best part of the quotation, father.

Jack, knowing how differently women estimate such matters, thought it was as well his mother did not hear this Httle speech. In fact, the good woman, always happy to welcome her wayward son, was at that moment in the kitchen, trying to improvise some deheacy to make amends for the very homely dinner which was already provided. She was always ready with an apology if anybody caUed, and when she came back to the parlour where Jack had been holding conference with his father, she uttered so many lamentations, while the cloth was being laid, that she had nothing better for her son, that her husband said bluntly \u2014"], [88, "80 LOST FOOTSTEPS. \"Nonsense, mother, what are you talking about ?

If we don't treat you well. an excuse won't mend the matter.\" Jack thought this sounded a little more gracious, and decided to leave further discussion of his matrimonial ideas till after dinner. There was just a chance, as the Reverend Josiah had dined with them lately, that a bottle of wine might be left in the house in which case his father might be induced to look at the affair in a more generous spirit. \" There now,\" said the old gentleman, when the cloth was cleared, and as Jack anticipated, the wine came upon the table to do honour to his visit ; \u2014 \" If the Queen has had no worse a dinner than ourselves, and eaten it with as good an appetite \u2014 I refer especiaUy to you, Jack, for love"], [89, "81 PARENTAL ADVICE. seems not to have had any iU-effect upon you in that respect \u2014 I should say Her Majesty is to be congratulated.\" \" Hear, hear,\" cried his hopeful son, and judiciously helped his parent to the port. \" Come, Jack, let us hear the whole business, how it began and how it's likely to end,\" said the old gentleman, meUowing with the effect of the dinner and the wine. \" There's nothing, in my opinion, more amusing for us old fogies than to see the fools young feUows make of themselves about chits of girls who are laughing in their sleeves at them aU the time, and thinking no more of love than a monkey is thinking of his grandmother.\" Hereupon Jack plunged into a most ecstatio description of Cecily's charms, while the old gentleman sipped his port, sometimes chuckling when his son's enthusiasm reached a very high pitch, or sometimes calling out merrily \u2014 \" Take another glass of port, Jack, and keep cool, my dear boy.

And where does this peerless fair one hang out ? \" Jack explained how UzelH adopted Cecily, but kept a discreet silence as to her former life. It would have been utterly impossible to make his father understand that anybody could be virtuous and pure who had ever been connected with a theatre. He enquired rather too curiously, Jack thought, as to Uzelli's prospects and the chance of his bestowing a dowry upon the young lady. Then his mother joined them, and the secret being unfolded to her, she was compelled to relieve her feelings by a few tears, which Jack thought a great bore, but was consoled afterwards by the very warm interest his mother immediately took in Cecily. The end of it was, that, backed up by maternal influence, Jack was promised some needful assistance, if he decided upon matrimony, though Mr. Edie assured him, as they shook hands at the garden-gate, that he \u2022\" would repent it \u2014 that men always did \u2014 when it was too late.\""], [91, "CHAPTER VII.

The constant watchfulness exercised by Louise had a most soothing and beneficial effect upon her husband's mind, and, at times, he seemed in some degree to recover his faculties, and was allowed to wander about alone. At other times he relapsed into his peculiar brooding humour, muttering strange phrases, which caused those about him to use additional caution. He had been left for some time by himself in one of these calmer moods ; but when they came to seek for him they were greatly alarmed not to find him, and, though the search was continued for some hours, no trace of him could be found. One of his peculiarities in his saner moods had been the desire for money, and to pacHy him, Louise had given him, from time to time, all the loose gold in her possession. This treasure appeared to afford him the greatest satisfaction. He gloated over it, and counted it in a wayward fashion, sometimes stopping in"], [93, "M.

For the most part he appeared entirely ignorant of their contents, and trifled with them as a chdd might have done, occasionaUy tearing them into minute fragments, and scattering them into the air, laughing merrily as he did so.

Morel had obtained possession of these letters, and could not be induced to part from them again. Frequently taking them from his pocket, and reading them furtively, he became so excitable and restless as to occasion very great uneasiness. Mr. Joyce was the first to take the alarm, and, from constantly watching M. Morel, he began to fear that the unfortunate man had planned some scheme of revenge against Adrian. The distance, however, from England, and the fact that Adrian was constantly shifting from place to place, rendered the chance of M. Morel finding him extremely improbable ; the HkeUest idea was, M. Morel himseH would fall into danger. Several days passed, and nothing whatever was heard of the missing man, when Mr. Joyce suggested they should make enquiries relative to the foreign steamers leaving England.

It would be useless he knew to write or telegraph, for Adrian's movements were uncertain, especially as in his last letters he had spoken of a journey to Paris, and of the excited state of the country.

From all they could gather it appeared that the purpose which had taken possession of the unfortunate man's mind, had so far influenced his outward manner that neither the crew or passengers of the vessel had noticed anything extraordinary about him. They enquired at the hotel where he had stopped, but the landlord, when closely questioned, had merely said \u2014 \" He was perhaps a Httle strange in his manner, and abrupt in his movements, but\" \u2014 with a significant shrug of the shoulders \u2014 \"he was Enghsh, what would you have ? \" After much trouble they ascertained that he had been last seen at a Httle viUage a few miles inland, and without losing a moment they started in the direction indicated.

Probably supposing his visitors to be no better than they ought to be, the man came very cautiously toward the gate, and they heard a most unpleasant \" click \" as he came near ; and by the light of the moon, which now rose high enough to throw a light into the valley, they saw that he carried a huge horse-pistol. He could not speak a word of English, and his French was a patois almost unintelligible to Mr. Joyce. \"We must certainly make him understand something quickly, however,\" said that gentle man, \" or we may have our brains blown out.

He was answered in a very pleasant female voice, and shortly a handsome, dark brunette, evidently the farmer's daughter, came down with a lamp, dehghted, apparently \u2014 as French girls always are \u2014 with anything in the shape of an adventure. To add to the satisfaction of the wanderers, they found that the young lady spoke exceUent Enghsh, and informed them that they were several mUes from the nearest town.

They were fortunate enough, indeed, in find ing the shelter they did, for the moon was soon hidden by dark clouds, and the wind increased till it became a complete hurricane. The rain fell in torrents, and was beaten with tremendous violence againts the diamond-paned casement. They could hear the rivulet by which they had wandered before reaching the farm, gradually changing its tone, swollen by the floods, till it roared Hke a cataract. They could hear the creaking of the tall trees in the vaUey, swayed to and fro by the violence of the wind, as though by the relentless hand of some invisible demon of the storm, while the wind howled in the vast chimney a chorus of indescribable voices."], [103, "95 M.

Their gay young hostess, whose mind, like that of the Bretons generally was full of wild superstitions, was awed and silenced by the tempest, and once, when Martin looked round the dimly-lighted room, trembled, and turned pale, and crept a little nearer to the table, till they began to chat again to reassure her. \"I am no believer in the supernatural,\" said Martin, \" but sometimes one is led to believe ' that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.'

Questioning their young hostess, they learned that the peasant, returning home late from the next town, had found the body of a man, which had evidently floated for a considerable distance down the torrent, and he feared had come there by foul means. There had been a mur der committed not long before, through pohtical animosity, and it was supposed that this was another victim.

The storm had abated during the last few minutes, and, following the peasant, they walked beside the stream, for, perhaps, half-an hour, and then, coming to a deep ravine, the peasant pointed to the spot where the body was lying, and they clambered down the rocks at once. The countryman said that owing to the storm and the darkness of the night he had mistaken his path, and had fallen down the ravine. The rocks being so slippery with the mud and rain he had lost his footing again, and had rolled to the very edge of the torrent where the body was found. The peasant was a stranger, and the farmer, when the discovery was made at first, became suspicious of his guide, and, holding the lantern up to his face, questioned him closely ; but the man's answers were evidently genuine, and the farmer was disposed to trust him. It was a difficult and even dangerous task to"], [107, "M.

Owing to the slippery state of the rocks, and flooded stream, it appeared extremely dangerous to quit the path ; and the peasant was sent back to the farm to procure ropes and a ladder. He returned quickly, and then, fastening the ladder to the overhanging trees, they descended to the bank of the torrent, and were not long in dis covering the drowned man. It was nearly an hour before they could raise the body of the unfortunate man to the footpath, for the lantern had been struck out of the farmer's hand by a flapping branch as he descended, and was carried down the stream. It required the utmost caution in the darkness so as not to endanger their own lives.

Placing it upon the ladder, they carried their horrid burden back to the farm, little dreaming what a revelation awaited them. There could be no doubt, when a light was procured and they examined the corpse, that it was the form of M. Morel they had discovered in this extraordinary manner. But how he came by death, whether by accident, or whether it was the result of a foul crime they had yet to discover. There had been method in his madness, that was evident.

In the meantime the authorities had been communicated with, and Adrian was not aUowed to go at liberty. According to the spirit of French law, every suspected person is treated as gudty. He was, therefore, Httle surprised to learn that he would, in all pro-"], [110, "102 LOST FOOTSTEPS babdity, be put upon trial, in consequence of the death of M. Morel. It grieved him deeply, also, remembering the mode in which French criminal trials are con ducted, to know that his only chance of clear ing himseH from the gravest suspicions would be to enter into detaHs and particulars of his past life, which, whde extremely painful to himseH, would also bring upon him the whole battery of cross-examination so freely indulged in by French judges. An examination took place within a few hours. The girl who had witnessed the conflict between Adrian and M. Morel from the window of the chateau, was called first to give her evidence. She could not state positively who made the first attack, as, when she saw the occurrence, the men were violently struggling, and in a moment afterwards, the top rail, which was placed to protect passengers, being, perhaps, rotten from age and damp, gave way, and M. Morel was thrown violently into the torrent ; but,"], [111, "103 THE TRIAL. when pressed closely, she could not say whether this fall was occasioned by Adrian, or not. The peasants who came from the chateau, when the girl gave the alarm, were then called, but they could add little to the evidence, be yond giving an account of the agitated state in which Adrian was when they reached him. The corpse of the drowned, or, as they evidently believed, murdered man, had not been found, as, owing to the turbulent and flooded state of the stream, it had probably drifted miles away. There was very little evidence upon which to convict Adrian; but the prefect, a pompous old man of narrow intellect, and little experi ence, was greatly impressed with the gravity of the circumstances, and decided to send the case to the Court of Assize. Adrian attempted to enter into explanations, as well as his limited knowledge of French would permit, but the pompous old prefect would not Hsten to a word, merely telHng him that the case would be tried, and then he"], [112, "104 LOST FOOTSTEPS. would have counsel, and an opportunity to make his defence, if he had any to make, \"which,\" added the prefect, \" according to present ap pearances, seems very doubtful.\" No time was lost by the provincial magis trate. The procurer-general drew up the act of accusation, and, after being confined to the chateau for three days, strictly watched and guarded, he was brought up in custody for the pubHc hearing of the case. Counsel was aUowed him ; but owing to his imperfect knowledge of the language, and the restrictions under which, in such eases, the counsel acts (being first admonished by the president, that in defending the prisoner, he must be careful to say nothing against his own conscience), his defence was extremely inefficient. Adrian knew enough French to comprehend the general sense of the president's admonition* and, spite of vexation and anxiety, could not repress a smde when he fancied what some of our Old Bailey practitioners would say to such a suggestion from the bench."], [113, "105 THE TRIAL. The jury being sworn in a very similar manner to that adopted in our own country, took their places, and the trial began. In France, the system of criminal justice rests principally upon the government. The gens d'armes seize an accused person, and frequently themselves cross-question him, or the witnesses against him with a minuteness of detaU which would not be tolerated in England. The reader, however, must remember that this was twenty years ago, and some considerable changes have taken place consequent upon an examination and comparison of the laws with those of our own country. There are many faults to be amended, and many abuses to be aboHshed, even yet, in the administration of our laws ; but they are stiU, as they have long been, in advance of the laws of other nations, as may be seen by the frequent introduction upon the continent of new systems assimilating to our own. England may proudly say that she was the first to throw off those barbarisms of the feudal ages, which stdl exert such an evU influence upon"], [114, "106 LOST FOOTSTEPS. the continent ; and especially with regard to the mode of treating a person suspected of crime, but not actually proved guilty. It commonly happens in France, that the most direct, and at times indeed, the only evidence against a prisoner is drawn from his own lips by the precise and skdful questions of the president, who has rather the air of an inquisitor, than the calm, patient deport ment of our own judges, investigating the case, as they generally do, in such a manner that it is impossible to say if they have any individual feeling for or against the prisoner. The superior principles of our own administra tion are seen in the fact that in France the prisoner who has the greatest amount of physical composure or hardihood, has the greatest chance of escaping the consequences of his deeds ; and, in too many eases, this coolness is the result of long continued and successful crime. A few preliminaries having been settled, the trial commenced by the president entering into a long statement, and a severe and one-sided examination of Adrian, questioning and cross-"], [115, "107 THE TRIAL. questioning him in the most elaborate manner; sifting his answers for the edification of the jury, and dismissing with a gesture of derision, any thing in his statements which did not appear relevant to the main question. Where Adrian was at fault in the language, an interpreter assisted; and he was drawn step by step through the whole labyrinth of his past life, and most intimate relations with M. Morel, Louise and her family. In fact, the attack \u2014 for it was nothing less\u2014 was carried on in such a way as to place many of the simplest and most natural incidents in the young painter's Hfe in a com pletely false light, and in a way calculated to give the jury the very worst impression. By questions, answered by Adrian with the greatest candour and freedom, he made it appear that Adrian by his interviews with Louise, had gone far to undermine the confidence M. Alorel would otherwise have placed in her. The strange event by which Louise had been separated from her husband, though related as briefly and clearly as possible, was so tortured and"], [116, "108 LOST FOOTSTEPS. twisted in substance by this incessant badgering, that the curiosity and suspicion of the jury in creased every moment. It seemed to them so obvious that Adrian's design was to weaken the influence of her husband for his own ends, that the president heaped positive insult upon him, and in fact treated him as if the crime was actuaUy proved against him. The counsel replied, but the case had been so much damaged by the vehemence of the president, that his efforts were almost useless. In addition, also to these disadvantages, the counsel in a French trial is so much shackled that there is Httle chance of his influencing the minds of a jury by such powerful appeals as we frequently hear in English courts of justice. The verdict is by a majority, and is agreed upon in a much more circumstantial way than in England, where the opinions of the jurors are more often than not formed as the trial is pro ceeding. In most cases their verdict is given very speedily after the summing up of the judge, and often without retiring from the box. But"], [117, "109 THE TRIAL. in France, especially in the provinces, there is much more ceremony observed. A formidable batch of papers is carried to the retiring room, and then an immense time is occupied with technicaUties, criticisms, references to the code, and long speeches, until the original impressions they have derived from the evidence must undergo considerable changes. In this country the judge may be said to be, and in fact generally is, in point of fact, counsel for the accused ; he warns him against avowals that might injure his cause with the jury, and watches his accusers with most patient care, in order that no more unfavourable opinion than is necessary may be presented to those who have to pass the verdict; for the general feeling of Englishmen is that it is monstrous to force a suspected person to criminate himseH. Nor indeed is it often necessary that he should do so to further the ends of justice. It almost invariably happens that some strange network of circumstances surrounds the man who commits any serious crime. He becomes involved un-"], [118, "110 LOST FOOTSTEPS. consciously in this labyrinth ; the clue often is found in the simplest manner, and from stage to stage is taken up by others, till detection becomes inevitable. For lack of this direct evidence it is, beyond doubt, that criminals do sometimes escape ; but it is unquestionably better that it should be so than that society should ever commit the outrage of sacrificing the innocent. The severe ordeal which Adrian had endured had thrown no light upon the actual circumstances of M. Morel's death. It was shown that he had perished by falling from the bridge in the struggle with Adrian, but there was no proof that Adrian struck the blow. He might have been only defending himself, as his counsel urged, against an attack made upon him by a furious lunatic. Much ingenuity was shown in suggesting causes for M. Morel's presence there. It was darkly hinted by the president, with a view, probably, to some admission by Adrian, that the drowned man had been allured by him to the spot upon some specious pretence ; but this"], [119, "111 THE TRIAL. damaging line of attack was negatived by the manner in which Adrian had been engaged during the few previous days. Communication had been received from Paris which clearly established the truth of his statements as to time and place. The hour of his arrival at the little country station, some few miles from the chateau, was also ascertained ; and then considerable doubt was thrown by the president upon Adrian's account of how he passed the time after leaving the railway till he reached the bridge. No consideration was aUowed for his fatigue and anxiety of mind. He was acting strangely, if not suspiciously, thought the president, in not at once making his way to the chateau. Again, with reference to Adrian's statement of M. Morel's insanity, they were not agreed. It was not possible, the president thought, that any but a sane man would have made the voyage from England, would have stayed at hotels, and generally conducted himself so as not to draw upon him any particular notice. Even supposing, also, the truth of this statement,"], [120, "112 LOST FOOTSTEPS. that in no way modified or altered the actual crime. It would have been more satisfactory, the president concluded, if the body of M. Morel had been found. An examination could then have taken place, and would, perhaps, have brought conclusive evidence as to the cause of death. The presence of wounds or contusions might prove the death to have been one of premeditated violence. For many weary hours did the jury ponder over these facts and suggestions, and still had arrived at no conclusion. They were not of a class hkely to come to a ready decision, being mainly small proprietors who farmed their own little estates, which were handed down from father to son. They were men who lived in the same spot aU their days, and seldom quitted it, save to transact business at some neighbouring town. They were men little accustomed to judge of serious crimes, and though utterly mystified by the strange ciroumstances Adrian had related, were rather disposed favourably towards him.

The vdlage near which the body of M. Morel had been found was about a dozen miles from the chateau of the Vaissier's; but there was no main road connecting them, nor any frequent communication. The road was difficult, and in bad weather almost impassable. It was, therefore, only the merest chance that Mr. Joyce and Martin discovered where and how M. Morel's death had taken place. Indeed, it was not tdl the jury were actuaUy weighing the evidence for and against Adrian that these gentlemen reached the court, and obtained an interview with the authorities.

He might have fallen, or have been pushed into the stream, but had received no injury upon the person which could have caused his death. There being Hterally nothing to criminate Adrian, he was set at Hberty, and with a sad heart went with his father and Air. Joyce to the farm where M. Morel was lying. He was decently buried in the churchyard of the Httle viUage, and then Mr. Joyce urged getting back to England with aU possible speed. He had too much deHcacyr, and too great a regard for Adrian's feelings, to make any allusion to the changes rendered possible by the death of M. Morel ; but that was what influenced him, and cau,sed him to press their speedy return. Contrary to his expectations, Adrian lingered.

There was a great nobleness of nature in Adrian, spite of many faults and failings. He had sought Louise eagerly when she was free. Even when united to M. Morel he found she was neglected and unhappy, he pressed his suit again, and urged a separation. But the first fever of expectation and hope had passed. He was not less anxious to win her after all these trials, but he was more willing to wait. He would prefer not to speak of his dearest wish tiU he could do so without a loss of self respect. He intended, if he came to England, to allow some time to pass before he sought an interview with Louise.

Louise had been tried by sorrow and regret ; she had paid a severe penalty for a single false step, and Adrian had learned enough of her to be satisfied that he would do well to await the time when Louise would, of herself, gladly welcome a more intimate relation. He was less impatient than of old, because his confi dence was greater. He had just passed that hectic period when youth is so impatient for the possession of the beloved object, and then so fre quently satiated immediately afterwards. He felt, that if no unforeseen hindrance stood between them, Louise would ultimately be his ; and if the happiness was of a less ecstatic kind than it might once have been, it was none the less likely to be sure and lasting."], [125, "CHAPTER IX.

Mynheer is wise in his generation ; and, to save himseH the painful worry of asking unnecessary questions, has got by heart the euphonious name \" Dorking,\" from which point he knows there is a chance of finding his brother-in-law at some time or other. Like children who are sent upon an errand, and whose minds are pre-occupied with their last game of marbles, or hop-scotch, and who"], [126, "118 LOST FOOTSTEPS. are compelled to repeat at intervals of three seconds the names of the articles they are sent for, so Mynheer in the whirlwind of steam whistles, the crash of buffers, the clanking of chains, and jostling of multitudes, feels that his only safety is in constantly repeating the name of the town which is his destination. It served his purpose well at first, for a Dover train was upon the point of starting ; and Mynheer, with his sohtary word \" Dorking,\" got a nod from a benevolent guard, with the added information, \" change at Redhill ; \" but so rapid and indistinct was his utterance, made doubly so by a small whistle stuck in his mouth, that to Mynheer the suggestion was of no practical value. Our worthy Dutchman took his seat in the train, grieving that the rigid enactments then in vogue respecting smoking prevent the soothing influence of the meerschaum. At the first station Mynheer caUed out, \" Dorking,\" and so for many others ; but re ceiving an invariable answer in the negative, Mynheer began to tire of the effort of keeping"], [127, "THE END OF MYNHEER KALm's JOURNEY. 119 awake so long, and beheving that he had a con - eiderable journey yet before him, composed himself by a nap, and the train reached Red HiU. Not all the bustle of changing, not all the hissing and sputtering of the engine, the clang of the station bell, or the solemn warnings of guard or porter, served to arouse Mynheer. Sta tion after station was passed, and ultimately Mynheer found himseH upon the platform at Dover, enquiring once more for Dorking, and exciting the interest of passengers, porters, and ticket collectors, who winked and smded over his blunder. Unmoved by his mishap, Mynheer, learning that there was some difference of fare to be settled, and that there was no other train back that night, pointed to his luggage, and muttered the word \" hotel ; \" then, diving into the recosses of his capacious pockets, he hauled up his beloved meerschaum, and sitting down on a barrow, standing empty in the road, puffed a meditative cloud with the keenest enjoyment, whUe the porter stood waiting his orders as to the luggage."], [128, "120 LOST FOOTSTEPS. There sat Mynheer, blowing away his annoy ance (if he felt any), while sundry smaU boys aired their wioked wits upon him, and mystified porters came out of the station to watch this ex traordinary stranger, whom no mishap could put out of countenance. Not that they wondered much. Men have become too matter-of-fact, now, to wonder at anything long. Novelties come so fast, and occupy so much of our attention, that we cannot spare much time for curiosity. We want something that wiU bring us money speedily, or whUe away an idle hour without any mental effort, and we are satisfied, whether we are peers or rail way porters. Finishing his meerschaum with the utmost gravity, Mynheer betook himseH to the hotel, the lights of which were shining brightly but a few yards away, though it was past midnight; and there, without a word to waiter or chambermaid, slowly mounted the stairs, and slept peacefuUy till morning.

His look was serene, for his face had none of those twists and angularities, which reveal that the soul within, whatever may be its strength or weakness, is apt to be blown about by the winds of adverse passions.

But breakfast over, he did not delay. There was a train back to Red Hill, shortly, and the obliging waiter having given Mynheer tho fuUest particulars as to the change of carriage, even left his other duties, and saw the worthy Dutchman to the station. Being so early in the day, and journeying also by a fast train, Mynheer managed this time not to forget the station, and without further delay or mischance arrived at last at Dorking. But there was no Mr. Joyce to meet him ; and when he enquired at the inn where he had heard that gentleman sometimes stopped, he learned to his dismay that Mr. Joyce had gone abroad, and it would be uncertain when he returned. This was a heavy blow and sore discourage ment to a gentleman of such methodical habits as Mynheer Kalm. But there was no help for it, and he engaged a fly to convey him to his relative's house, wondering now, more than ever, what could be the errand which made Mr. Joyce"], [131, "THE END OF MYNHEER KALM's JOURNEY. 123 so urgent \u2014 wondering still more at the additional urgency of the business that could have taken Mr. Joyce away at this time. But he would know in time \u2014 that was enough for Mynheer Kalm. If there was any good news it would certainly keep ; if bad, a Httle delay in ascertaining it, was not a cause for regret. So, with this admirable philosophy, Mynheer mounted the fly, and was soon winding through the pleasant lanes leading to Leith Hill and Molton. But there are moments when the most placid mortals can be greatly roused \u2014 when the un sympathetio kindle with passion, and the indolent are stirred into feverish activity. Mynheer was never, perhaps, in a more somnolent mood than when his conveyance reached Molton, for having no extarordinary anticipations respecting his visit to Mr. Joyce, he had allowed the driver to take his own time, and it was late in the afternoon when he reached the village. But as the fly turned the corner of the beautiful lane which, shaded by lofty trees, conducts the traveller to Alolton, Mynheer saw a vision which,"], [132, "124 LOST FOOTSTEPS. if it did not make each individual hair stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine, at least quickened his blood and stirred his nervous system as it had never been stirred before. For, looking through an opening of the trees, at a spot where a stile led to a pathway across the fields, Mynheer saw a lady coming slowly up the path, and that lady advancing nearer each moment, looking very lovely but very sad, absorbed in her own thoughts \u2014 mystery of mysteries, what did it mean ? His darling Louise, he had left in her grave ! With his own hand he had scattered flowers upon the coffin containing that beloved form. Yet, unless some dark spell was upon him \u2014 unless reason had forsaken him \u2014 that was the child of his heart \u2014 his lost Louise. It was impossible for him to speak or move. He believed for the moment that he had lost his reason. The incidents of past days spent with Louise \u2014 his love, joy, and misfortune \u2014 all that had been and might have been \u2014 daring hopes for the future \u2014 flashed upon his bewildered mind like phantoms.

Twinges of fear \u2014 dawnings of hope \u2014 relapses of despair. \u2014 At one instant it was the actual form of his darling Louise, whose arms were about his neck, whose burning kisses were upon his Hps. Then he was in a world of shadows, and he was borne upon the irresistible wings of fate from ecstacy to annihilation. Then the sweet voice he remembered so well, soothed and calmed the excited man, and in a few seconds he ceased to be that strange compound \u2014 half angel, half idiot \u2014 which genuine passion will sometimes make of an ordinary man.

Then explanations came in a torrent, joyous at first, as explanations usuaUy are when dear ones meet, but soon saddening, when facts have to be told in place of ardent hopes and happy memories. Mynheer Hstened with amazement and sorrow to the strange tale of M. Morel's weakened intellect and disappearance. He had no suggestion to make, nor could he unravel the mystery. He was glad to know that Mr. Joyce had immediately gone in search of the unfortunate man, for he had the utmost confidence in that gentleman's energy and judgment. His sole pleasure was to dwell upon the Httle incidents of their past life in Rotterdam, and Mynheer must have talked more in the few hours following. his meeting with Louise, than he had done in several previous years.

Joyce and Martin arrived in England, and she was told all. Mr. Joyce could not state the whole events without frequent mention of Adrian's name ; but he noticed with pain that whenever he did so, Louise appeared to shrink from any reference to him. In fact, it was the cause of the deepest grief to her to learn that through Adrian her husband should have met his death. Perfectly convinced in her heart that no blame could possibly attach to him, there came into her mind the possibihty that if any nearer relation should be established beween them, there might be room for censorious voices to ddate upon the details of her husband's death. There was but one way to avoid this ; and it was, she thought, as much her duty to Adrian, as to preserve her own honour, that she resolved never to see him any more. It was a sad alternative ; and it was with great hesitation she spoke of it to Air. Joyce. That gentleman, taking a more ordinary view of the circumstances, combatted her resolution warmly but without effect."], [136, "128 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Then there was Mynheer Kalm, urging, as much as his mild temperament allowed, that they should at once go back to Rotterdam. For Mynheer knew nothing of Louise's feehng with regard to Adrian, and was only too anxious to try the soothing effect of famiHar scenes upon his daughter's mind. He had learned enough of M.

For he saw at once that the touch of death"], [143, "135 PARTED. was upon the brow he loved, that the touch of death had given that unearthly brightness to the eyes and that unworldly solemnity to the tones of the plaintive voice. \"Are you not tired of sitting here so long, Arthur?\" enquired Mary softly. A gentle kiss was the only reply. To speak with such a full heart as his was impossible. \" I was glad, Arthur, very glad, when you came ; but I wished to defer to the last mo ment the fatal knowledge that we must part so soon. Our dream of life must be concluded elsewhere. Yesterday I did not think the end was so near, but I feel now that it cannot be many days, perhaps not many hours.\" \" Oh, for God's sake, don't talk so, Mary ; you are weak to-night, and, perhaps, the ex citement of seeing me is hurtful. If you could sleep a Httle, the fresh dawn would see you revive again. \"I shall not see many more dawns, you may be certain, dear Arthur. I shaU die with some bright hopes and visions unfulfilled ; but"], [144, "136 LOST FOOTSTEPS. I have faith in the decrees of God, and I shall pass away the happier, in the belief that you will not forget me. I shall hope that our first sweet meeting upon a summer evening as bright as this wdl be long remembered. Not to make you unhappy, either,\" said Mary, tenderly winding her arm about his neck, and bidding him, in whispering tones, to check his fast falhng tears. Then, with sudden resolution, she insisted that he should stay no longer, and they parted for the night. Percival Hope saw her first in the morning. He was an early visitor, for Mary treasured the few peaceful moments she spent with him when the house was stdl and undisturbed. She had a final request to make, too, which she preferred to speak of when they were quite alone. \" You know, dear Air. Hope, that pleasant, mossy waU where we have often sat together, and where, I dare say, my girlish, idle talk has interfered with many a thought for a ser mon. Let me lie there, for the wind comes so"], [145, "137 PARTED. gently through the drooping boughs, and the sun seems to linger there longer than any where else.\" The curate promised, for he knew it was hope less to tempt her with alluring anticipations of returning health. \" And one thing more, dear friend. You will speak gently to Arthur, wiU you not, and don't blame him too much. He has been idle and reckless I dare say, but not more so than others of his age and position.\" Mr. Hope had too often Hstened to Mr. Joyce's complaints of his nephew's irregularities to be able to think very favourably of the young man ; but what could he say at such a time, except to promise whatever Alary desired- So strong and enduring are our earlier im pressions, that slight feelings, circumstances, and associations are embalmed and consecrated in our memories as long as we live. How much more Hkely still was Mary, fading away, with no knowledge of the hardness and apathy of the world, to retain in her last moments pleasant"], [146, "138 LOST FOOTSTEPS. memories of the days she had spent with her young lover, and to beheve that there was much goodness in him which others could not discover. She had rallied for a time, and appeared so animated that, but for his great experience in similar cases, Mr. Hope might have been led to believe she would recover; but, later in the day, when Arthur came, there was a change, and it was evident, even to the young man himself, that she was rapidly sinking. Then, from hour to hour the only question was which hour would be the last. Sometimes life seemed absolutely gone, then, for a brief space she would revive, and, perhaps, in a few faint whispering tones, or with only a gentle pressure of the hand, give Arthur the assurance that she yet Hved. As for Arthur, the sight of the pure, unselfish girl, who loved him so faithfully, so swiftly passing away from Hfe and love, awakened in him thoughts and feelings suoh as he had never felt before. A lover of pleasure, he had yet to learn how smaU and insignificant a part it plays"], [147, "139 PARTED. in the great scheme of existence. He had been unconscious tiU that moment how many a folly (and often worse than folly) had been counter acted by the influence of a pure and unworldly nature like this, and he felt as the shipwrecked mariner feels who sees the topmost spar of the vessel that might have saved him sink beneath the line of the horizon.

In all the years of his ministry, Percival Hope had never felt so deep a sorrow as for the loss of this sweet and gentle girl, but his grief did not stand in the way of his performing his various duties ; and it is well for those in the humbler walks of Hfe, that they have little time for dwelling upon sorrowful memories. Work is a powerful agent in subduing and alleviating grief. Mr. Hope undertook to carry out the last wishes of poor Mary, whose grave was dug as she de sired beneath the sunny wall where many happy hours had been spent together. One might say with Shelley, that it was enough to make one in love with death, the prospect of sleeping in so fair a spot ; for the church of Molton stood upon"], [149, "REQUIESCAT IN PACE. 141 a gentle hiU, and the churchyard sloping down to the road commanded a lovely prospect of hill dale and pasture. The day before the funeral, aU the children of the Sunday schools where Mary had taught came up to the mill to look at her in her last sleep. All the unmarried young women of the village had been there previously, for it was one of the simple customs of the village thus to do honour to the memory of one who like themselves had never been wedded. They were fuU of sorrow for the loss of one so young and full of promise, but were not awed like the children, many of whom were in the presence of death for the first time. Mr. Gabriel was a rich man, but, according to Mary's own desire, there was no ostentation shown in the last offices of death. The coffin was ex- tremely plain. There were many flowers about the coffin, brought by the young girls who had been there in the morning, and bunches of rosemary, which the old people said would keep green for years and decay only as the lonely occupant of the grave decayed.

The children lingered with their hands behind them, with that look upon the face which plainly told that they had seen without comprehend ing a great mystery, and at last scuffled down the long passages of the miUer's great house, whispering and half afraid, for somehow the pale dead face brought with it the remembrance of past days when, living, the sweet-tempered and gentle girl had patiently Hstened to their blunder ing lessons, her face shining like an angel's when she had succeeded in making any one of their number comprehend some subHme truth. Even upon Arthur was bestowed some of the respect and reverence this simple girl had inspired, and the young man pondered deeply over the lesson thus mournfully brought home to him.

A few days had passed since the grave closed over Mary Gabriel ; but Arthur Joyce still lingered in the neighbourhood, and often, at dusk, when the village was stdl, wandered alone to the quiet grave.

There is something irritating rather than sooth ing, in such a scene, when the soul is iU at ease, and thus Arthur Joyce found it. To him, at that moment, it would have been greater relief to have paced the deck of a ship tossed upon mountainous waves, or have braved a wild storm in some remote solitude. He was in the full vigour of early manhood, but never before had his feelings been thoroughly aroused. The ordinary excitements of a Hfe of pleasure, surrounded by reckless and dissolute companions, too often blind and deaden the soul to the real grandeur and significance of life. With such associates and such aims, the heights and depths\u2014 the vast possibilities \u2014 the responsibilities and cravings of the earnest individual man serve mainly as food for Hght raillery ; and re membering all this, though feeling it in its full force, for the first time in his life, Arthur Joyce felt that it would be impossible for him to take his place again with the companions"], [156, "148 LOST FOOTSTEPS. of his past life, either to share their pursuits or their pleasures. All this he was prevented from confiding to his uncle by the remembrance of his former follies; and it was very possible, too, that Mr. Joyce, having formed a very decided opinion in reference to Arthur, would hardly have given the young man the sympathy and encourage ment such a mental crisis demanded ; but in Percival Hope he found a man who was better calculated by habit and experience to console and advise him. To him Arthur opened his heart as only the young do when in the first bitterness of a deep grief, and the first disenchanting effect of new and unexpected revelations of human life they see how shallow and untenable all their hastily- formed ideals suddenly become ; who:i they perceive how instantaneously they are shattered to frac ments by the first touch of reality. These are the moments of all others when the young are fortu nate if they meet with a wise and kind adviser who is neither a cj nic nor an optimist \u2014 who is"], [157, "149 AN EMIGRANT PARTY. familiar with human grief and who knows its cause and its cure. There was at that time in almost every village in England great discussion with regard to Emigration, and, after much consideration, Arthur resolved to join a party which was about setting out from Molton. The leader of this movement was but a labour ing man, but his intelligence and honesty went far to make amends for his deficiency in cultiva tion. Arthur had met and conversed with him after one of his solitary rambles and had spent some time at his cottage. He saw plainly how hard life was for such a man in an English village, and ceased to wonder that he and others like him were determined to try their fortune abroad. His cottage, always well kept with flowers in the windows, and creeping plants climbing gracefully about the porch, was a charming picture ; but the struggle within doors was out of keeping with its external beauty, and Job Trinder, after long endurance and much trial, had decided to quit it. \" Then, it's quite certain, Trinder, that you are"], [158, "150 LOST FOOTSTEPS. going ?\" enquired Arthur, when he again visited the cottage. \" Quite true, sir. Our minds are made up. You see, we poor men don't get forward in this country. One year the weather is favourable and wages are a little higher, then aU goes back again through a bad harvest, iUness, or some other cause. What with time going on, and we getting older and less fit for work, there's little hope for us but to end our days in the union.\" \"You must have been here many years \" said Arthur. \" Couldn't you hold on a little longer ?\" \" No, sir,\" Job replied, \" we get tired of always fetching up old scores. It wiU be better to wipe out and begin afresh.\" \" I begin to think so myself,\" Arthur said sadly, \" and, if you would not object to my joining you, I feel that I might begin a better life in the new world than I have led in the old.\" \" But what do gentlemen want to leave the old country for ? \" enquired Job ; \" England is a very good place for people who can dress well, and keep a Httle cash in their pockets.\""], [159, "151 AN EMIGRANT PARTY. \" There are difficulties which cannot be solved by dressing weU, or a balance at the banker's, Job, and such a position is mine. In the far West I could endure labour and hardships which would be impossible here, and in such a Hfe I feel is my only chance of becoming such a man as I crave to be.\" \" Well, sir, it's not for me to raise any ob jection,\" answered Job, \"and, I daresay, a young gentleman like yourself, with some scholarship) wdl be a great advantage to us.\" \"That's settled, then, and I'll go,\" cried Arthur, and the men shook hands heartily, and parted. It was with very melancholy feelings that Percival Hope saw the broad-wheeled waggon roU up the steep hill of Molton, early upon a midsummer morning, to convey to the station the goods and luggage of the emigrant party. He sympathised with them deeply, and sighed to think, as the waggon stopped at Job Trinder's cottage door, that these men, who"], [160, "152 LOST FOOTSTEPS. were leaving their native land, were the steadiest and most energetio of his poorer parishioners. His fanoy wandered to past scenes, in whioh these simple people had played their part man fully, patiently, and with a genuine honesty of purpose worthy of a better fate. Yet fame blew no trumpet over their deeds. Their own feeling of self-respect, and the heartfelt greeting of their friends and kinsfolk were all they had to cheer them on their future path, and lessen the sad ness of their unwilling departure from the land of their youth. How the good curate longed for unbounded wealth, that he might with one word, one wave of the hand, have stayed this sacrifice \u2014 for sacrifice he could not but consider it. He knew fuU weU that poverty had not weaned them from love of their fatherland. Too often the human heart oHngs most reso lutely to that whioh has caused it the bitterest trials. But a touch arrests his attention, and he turns to see Arthur Joyce at his side. \" They will soon be away, now, sir,\" Arthur"], [161, "153 AN EMIGRANT PARTY. said, \" and I came to see if I could be of any assistance to you ; my own outfit wdl not occupy any great space,\" he continued, smiling sadly, \"and I have arranged to meet them at the railway.\" With that, Arthur, nodding to Mr. Hope, went into the cottage, and assisted to bring out the homely goods. He was soon followed by several assistants. Down came bent and haggard-looking old' men, whom one would not for a moment have suspected as about to undertake a voyage to a new world, unless, indeed, it had been that undiscovered country from which no traveller returns. Dark-eyed and ruddy-cheeked girls also, who, one would have thought, might surely have found homes and husbands, amongst the green fields of their native vil lages ; sturdy young men, the pride of many a golden cornfield, or new-mown sward, and the life of many a jovial harvest home, were there, eagerly and silently bringing out their household goods to the edge of the steep"], [162, "154 LOST FOOTSTEPS. pathway, to be lifted into the waggon, and carried across the sea. In their ignorance of the requirements of new settlements many articles were sent which could be of no possible use to them. Again, other items were unwillingly left behind, be cause they were identified with some home association. Perhaps a brown jug which had often foamed with ale at a village festival, or a bucket whieh, for half a lifetime, had been dipped into that old well outside the cottage door, destined some future day to lave the flood of the Mississippi. One feels the keen edge of an axe as he flings it into a basket, thinking, perhaps, of the dusky forest which will fall beneath its blows. Another looks lovingly at a scythe, or reaping hook, as a knight might glance at a trusty sword ; and who will blame him, for he wields a nobler implement than spear or battleaxe.

Uzelli Gives Way. Adrian felt so much confidence in his ultimate fate that he grieved less than Mr. Joyce expected, when informed by that gentleman of Louise's departure for Rotterdam. He imagined that the tranquil life at Rotterdam, filled, as it would be, with memories of happy days they had spent together, might revive that feeling towards him which he was certain Louise once possesseJ. \"At three-and-twenty a young and beautiful woman is not likely to become dead to the world, and the chances of a handsome and clever young husband,\" said Mr. Joyoe merrily, when talking over the matter with Martin Hope, who was feverishly anxious to see his son happy and contented.

He was still as ambitious as ever, and would be far more likely to make a direct effort to win Louise, if he had taken any position as an artist. He had been greatly moved to see Cecily again looking so happy and beautiful. In many tender and affectionate letters ho had received from her he had traced a higher development of intellect than he had thought her capable of, and when he saw her again he was convinced that her pure soul had not been dimmed by the breath of the world, for her thoughts and feelings were expressed with the freshness and freedom of her girlhood.

Why not leave the contest to those who are compelled to endure it for a bare livelihood?\" Adrian understood very well Cecily's allu sion ; but he believed he knew Louise best, and did not combs t her views. He did not get on as well in London as formerly. Although it is unquestionably the place where there is the greatest demand and the greatest reward for every kind of mental effort, it is certain that to some natures it is anything but a nursery for their powers.

It is too often in London a match against time, the intellect being occupied most about anything that can be turned to imme diate account. It is one of the most common and natural weaknesses of human nature which prompts us to acquire every possession, and gain every enjoyment by the quickest and easiest means. We seldom make for ourselves what we can readily purchase, and are generally willing to accept the conclusions of others rather than undergo the labour of examining for ourselves. The opportunities, also, for immediate enjoy ment and recreation are so numerous in an immense city, and we are tempted to relax so frequently when our work does not proceed as we wish, that it is almost certain that there is a greater proportion of failures among those who follow a career of mental effort in Lon don, than elsewhere.

The subject Adrian had chosen was quite of a modern character, and he was therefore not surprised to find UzelH discovering many faults in it. Adrian, however, knew that it would be but wasting time to devote himself to the cold abstractions of ideal art for which the professor had pined all his Hfe, but which found less favour daily with the public. The subject was an Italian Festa, and was full of colour and animation. A bold group of figures in the foreground dancing, formed a strong contrast to a Une of distant mountains upon the opposite shore of a lake, veiled with the golden haze of a summer evening. There were in tho middle distance the masts and rigging of numerous vessels, all deiorated"], [169, "161 UZELLI GIVES WAY. in honor of the fete with flags and streamers, and scattered about at different points were macaroni dealers, coffee sellers, tumblers, quacks, our old friend Punch, and musicians playing on various instruments \u2014 altogether a picture full of life and variety, but which the professor criticised, quizzed, and pretended to dislike, bouncing out of the room with half-a-dozen oaths, in as many languages, but constantly calling in again, nevertheless, curious to see what Adrian was likely to make of it. Adrian frequently saw Jack Edie, and won dered greatly at a very decided change in his manner and habits. He was evidently no longer the Jack Edie of old. And his indo lence seemed entirely to have forsaken him, along with a large amount of conceit which had hitherto been patent to everybody. Adrian was not long in discovering the in fluence of Cecily, and rightly judged that it was for her sake Edie worked so hard, painting anything and everything, for the young man began to be conscious that he would not make 11 VOL.

Adrian smiled sometimes at the extremely domestic tone of the works of a student, who so lately revelled in all the possibilities of High Art. Once Edie aimed at nothing lower than a goddess or nymph, now he exercised his pencil on broom girls and watercress dealers. In old times he disported amongst the fabulous monsters of mythology ; he now succeeded famously with two or three cows cooling them selves in the shadow of a haystack ; and when Adrian called upon him, previous to leaving London, to finish his own picture at leisure, he found Edie painting, with evident gusto, a child playing with a kitten. \" Y'ou see,\" said Edie, as if in explanation, \u2022' one mustn't be too particular when one has a commission from Wardour Street.

Adrian looked at it with great surprise, for it was a most finished likeness of Cecily, and Edie, who blushed like a schoolboy, said nothing. \" Your friend, Solomon Levy, has good taste if he purchases anything of that sort, Jack,\" said Adrian. \" Indeed I shall be very glad if you will allow me to purchase it myself, for I'm certain I could not equal it. You must have taken great interest in the original, I fancy.\" Edie's feeling with regard to Cecdy was so sensitive and delicate that he was not sorry, now that the ice was broken, to make a friend of Adrian, and induce him to break the matter to UzelH. He had some qualms of conscience as to his own doings in the days of their earher acquaintance, but they were both a few years older, and Edie hoped inwardly that Adrian's memory was not too retentive upon these points. \" The fact is,\" said Edie, \" that we are en gaged\u2014Cecily and I, and don't know, for our lives, how to break it to UzelH.

He disclaimed, to some extent, the influence Edie supposed him to have with UzeUi, but promised to do all in his power to ensure the happiness of the lovers, a promise which brought a profusion of thanks from Edie. But Adrian found when he attempted to keep his promise, that he had no easy task to per form.

He had just finished, when Adrian caUed upon him, the scene from the \" Tempest,\" upon which he had lavished many a month of careful and loving skill and labour. The admirable like ness of Cecily, whioh formed the most prominent, or at least the most attractive, figure in the"], [174, "166 LOST FOOTSTEPS. composition, led them naturally to speak of her. But when Adrian became somewhat en thusiastic in her praise, he was responded to by a hasty monosyllable, or a muttered sound which resembled a stifled grunt more than anything human. The professor was quite certain, from the moment Adrian began to speak of Cecdy, that he had an object in doing so, and he was so tenacious of his hold upon CecUy's affections, that he was unwilling to hear any suggestion whatever having reference to her. Adrian hardly knew how to begin. At last, feeling it incumbent upon him to say something, if he meant to keep his promise to Edie, he said abruptly \u2014 \" Cecily has grown up a fine girl, Mr. UzeUi.\" \" Oh, yais, zere is not many better zan my Ceeseley, eider in looks or in disposition, and I tink she lose me, Got bless her.\" \" That she does I can assure you, Air.

Cecily was not long in doubt as to the cause of Uzelli's agitation, for the blunt old man put the question directly in the plainest and most unmistakeable way. She was a little startled by his abruptness, but, with her usual simphcity, replied at once \u2014 \" My d^ar, kind friend, I ought to have told you from the first,\" said Cecily with tears in her eyes. \" When you took me from a Hfe that was hateful to me, and I became the happy mistress of your home- \u2014 free from aught that could lower me in my own estimation \u2014 free from the temptations and dangers of the world without \u2014 I ought to have made a better return than to have kept any secret from you.\" \"Zere is no harm, Ceeseley, my lose.

Adrian saw that the old professor could not resist her; and it was odd to perceive how this crotchety old man, who all his Hfe had been out of the way of tenderness and affection, basked in the evident genuineness of Cecily's love for him. It was easy to understand how un- willing he was to give up his empire over her fresh young heart, but at length he said with an effort \u2014 \" Ceeseley, my lose, you vas ze good angel of"], [180, "172 LOST FOOTSTEPS. my life, ven I vas almost weary of zat life, and \u2014 Got dam ! we must not be parted.

Having once overcome his objection to Cecily showing affection for anyone else, the professor seemed quite in a hurry for the marriage to take place. Never was there a greater trans formation than was seen during the past year in Uzelli's house in Fitzroy Square. It had been one of the dirtiest, dullest houses in that part of London, which is saying a great deal. The windows were encrusted with smoke and dust, and never opened for months together ; the door-step was always muddy, and the few visitors who called upon him so rarely made anybody hear \u2014 by reason of broken beU-wires and dilapidated knockers \u2014 that it was usual to hammer with a stick, cane, or broken umbrella, at the nearest window, or shout tdl the square"], [182, "174 LOST footsteps. echoed with the sound, before anyone could gain admittance to the old painter's sanctum. But all this was changed now, and UzelH, who, owing to the excellent management of Cecily, found himself the possessor of a consider able balance at his bankers, determined to make his pretty housekeeper ample amends for her diligence. Notwithstanding her entreaties, that he would not be so extravagant, tradespeople and work men were invading the house from morning till night, and Cecily, finding it useless to gain say the professor, set herseH to evolve beauty, comfort, and order out of a chaos of furniture, decorations, and workpeople. Jack Edie, though he begged hard to share these arrangements, was kept at arm's length by UzelH, until something like completeness was achieved. When, at last, he was aUowed to see the dingy old house which was to be his future home, he overwhelmed UzelH with expressions of gratitude and pleasure.

Then she rushed to the open window in a perfect rapture, respecting the brilliant array of flowers with which UzelH had decked the balcony the day before. Then it was settled, Edie was to have a studio to himself; though at present it must be confessed, Cecily's own belongings principally filled the room, and the fine new easel which was to be a special present from UzeUi, was decorated with her walking hat and mantle. Jack had imbibed strange theories of domestic life owing to his Bohemian habits, and the appearance of comfort and homeliness which surrounded him filled him with the strangest feelings, so that he could hardly do justice to the exertions of the charming girl, who had done so much in producing the wonderful changes in the Fitzroy Square domicile. As to Cecily, she ran joyously from room to"], [184, "176 LOST FOOTSTEPS. room, occasionally coming across Uzelli and exclaiming with every new purchase \u2014 \" You naughty man, you must leave off. in deed you will ruin yourself if you go on at this rate.\" \" Hold your tongue, mees, and mind you own beezeness \u2014 ze picture yonder fetch me near a tousand pounds, and ze nobleman who bought him say to me so kindly ' Now, UzeUi, my dear fellow, whatever money you like to have, say de vord and let me write a sheque, ' and I say ' Milord, zere is a sweet leetle girl whose face is yonder in ze picture, and zis leetle maid wants to run off and be married.'

UzeUi received his meriment with the greatest good humour, and then handing Cecily the cheque, told her to pay it into the bank at once, or he might Hght his pipe with it. As such a catastrophe was by no means unlikely, UzelH being one of the most absent of men, she hastened to do his bidding. Her happy lover slipped away to see the cheque paid. This son of Bohemia could hardly beheve his eyes when he beheld this tiny shp of paper \u2014 five hundred pounds with just a stroke of the pen, was, to Edie, a transformation hardly seeming possible away from the Mint or Bank of England.

It grieves us to state that his valuable pubhcation never reached the hands of that gentleman. Jack was far too engrossed with his charming com panion to think much about the state of UzeUi's soul, and the painter himseH did not appear to have any very serious qualms about it, for they found him, on their return to Fitzroy Square, smoking with the utmost enjoyment, and altogether appearing to have had, as our American cousins say, \" a good time.\" Stdl he was getting quite impatient for their return, and listened to Jack's account of their reception by his parents with the HveHest interest.

As Jack was about to leave, therefore, the pro fessor, not without a certain nervous hesitation, called him into the study. \" Ven yon 6poke to me at ze first about Ceeseley, Mr. Edie, I told you zere was an objeotion.\" \"You did, answered Jack, and I blush to"], [189, "FITZROY SQUARE. 181 remember how unjust and ungenerous I was in my judgment of you and your motives with reference to Cecdy.

Of course he speedily discovered Maude, and George near at hand doing his best to attract her attention, in which effort he certainly succeeded to some extent, though often enough gaining only a satirical glance from the beloved one. When Maude perceived Frank, she was de lighted, anticipating, as she- did, plenty of fun in watching their rivalry. Frank quickly got near"], [211, "MAUDE AND HER LOVERS. 203 her, and, evidently at a loss for something to say, remarked that she was looking duH, whioh brought from Maude a hope that he would endeavour to enhven her ; and turning to George, she said, \"Do you hear, Mr. Sandford, your friend is complaining of my dullness to-night.\" \" If you wiU favor me in the next quadrille , I shall be able to judge for myseH,\" said George, and Maude stood up at once, whUe Frank chuckled inwardly in anticipation that George would inevitably make a fool of himseH, either by losing his place, trampling upon her dress, dashing her against the opposite couples, or stamping upon her feet. But George was pretty successful, and got through the quadrille without any special mischief. Frank was beside himseH with jealousy, and, seizing his opportunity, engaged Maude for a waltz, determined to do or die. \" You had better have contented yourseH with a quadrille, I should think,\" said George with a maHcious look, utterly astounded as he saw Frank with a confident air; \"a fellow looks such a"], [212, "204 LOST FOOTSTEPS. donkey when obliged to sit down giddy and half blind after the first turn round the room.\" \" An opportunity for you to gain fresh laurels,\" retorted Frank, flying off with Maude in another second. Maude was a delightful dancer ; her figure was light and graceful ; she was not too taU, and every movement was fuU of gaiety and grace. SaiHng round the room with this pretty girl in his arms, Frank was intoxicated with deHght ; and so weU had he profited by the instruction of old Hawkins as to draw many envious glances from the Moltonian youths, whose experiences of waltzing were extremely limited. Frank, however, could not trust himseH to another waltz, thinking it was the best generalship to leave a good impression behind him. Acting in accordance with this view, he determined to leave the party early, though with a mingled feehng of happiness and anxiety. Maude, of course, took not the slightest notioe of his departure. She had always a stock of admirers on hand, and seemed supremely"], [213, "205 MAUDE AND HER LOVERS. indifferent as to their comings or goings. Frank, however, was delighted to beheve that he had made a favorable impression upon the capricious young beauty, while he believed, also, that George would so exult in his departure as to become quite overbearing in his attentions, and thus cause a re action in his favor. Frank went away quite satisfied that the card house of his rival was sapped at the foundation and must speedily faU. Yet he half repented afterwards of his seH-denial.

It was a glorious moonlight night ; and from time to time some of the dancers came out upon a terrace in the garden which was raised high enough above the road to give a pleasant view of the surrounding scenery. Frank was parading the lane beneath dissatisfied with himself for having left the party, when he fancied he could hear"], [214, "206 LOST FOOTSTEPS. Maude's voice upon the terrace above. He listened, but could not distinguish what she said. A sharp pang of jealous doubt crossed his mind, however, when he saw his rival, George Sandford, emerge from the shadow of some trees with Maude leaning upon his arm. They were coming towards the gate, and she was wishing her companion good night in her livehest tones, while George, evidently dehghted, took her hand and pressed to his Hps. It was reaUy too bad, thought Frank, who cursed himself for a noodle in having left the room a minute earher than his rival and for beheving that Masde would think of him three seconds after he had gone. He was relieved to hear the voice of Mrs. Crankley expostulating. \" I reaUy must speak to Mr. Hope,\" said that lady severely, \" It is past midnight and you know how averse your papa is to late hours.\" \" With such a moon as this,\" exclaimed Maude perversely, \" I don't think I shaU go home for these two hours.\" George also, greatly to Mrs. Crankley's horror,"], [215, "207 MAUDE AND HER LOVERS. pleaded that Maude should stay a Httle longer ; but the worthy dame was too careful of the \" proprieties \" to give wild youths such encourage ment ; and, dismissing the young man with frigid coolness, took the fair and fickle damsel away. Little did that precise lady dream that another adorer was lingering within earshot, rejoicing heart and soul at the discomfiture of his rival. Young people who go to an evening party in the country are contented to walk home afterwards if the weather is fine, and frequently the pleasantest part of the affair is the stroU homeward through the fields by moonhght. Maude was walking rather sulkily beside her companion, feeling, it must be confessed, that she had done less mischief than she would have liked among the susceptible hearts of the young men of Molton, when, to the horror of Mrs. Crankley, Frank Littleton stood beside them. \" We had better walk a Httle faster, Maude, my dear,\" said that lady ; \" your dear papa wiU be quite impatient at our being so late.\" \"My dear papa had better go to bed,\" re-"], [216, "208 LOST FOOTSTEPS. sorted the young lady, \" and then we needt'n hurry.\" In vain Mrs. Crankley urged and fidgetted. Maude, with a string of compliments falhng gratefuUy upon her ears, with the memory of half a-dozen conquests to think over and smile at, and with the soft air of a summer night cooling her fresh rosy cheeks, after the heated atmosphere of the baU room, was in no hurry to reach home. And Frank, too, forgetting the jealous hate with which he saw George Sandford's attentions to Maude, exerted himself to amuse her, and, spite of the short sniffs and muttered warnings of Airs. Crankley, persisted in accompanying them all the way to the curate's door. When Mr. Hope, who had been sitting up for them, saw Frank's deferential leavetaking, he was not in the best of humours.

It was out of the ordinary legal track ; but Bloxham and Co. had always done a snug style of business amongst the merchants and shippers of Eastcheap and Tower HU1.

Aware that his old master had every facility for managing a difficult case, he put the affair entirely into Bloxham' s hands, explaining how matters stood fully.

Madame was perfectly well aware that she had no claim to the wealth she clung to so tenaciously ; but she had gained sufficient know ledge of Louise during the short period of her married Hfe to believe that the opposition would not come from that quarter, and she did not for a moment dream of the powerful opponent who had been watching her movements. So utterly had M. Morel squandered his own estate, that, at the time of his marriage, he had not a farthing unencumbered. Heavy loans, high rates of interest, constantly-increasing debts, had swept away all that remained of the fortune his father had acquired, and, but for the marriage with Louise, they would have been absolutely destitute.

He had become extremely attached to Edie, and marvelled greatly at the change in the young man since he first came as a student to Fitzroy Square. To a fine form, and an independent manly bearing, there was added a decision and purpose in the expression of his face which had hitherto been wanting. His thick fair hair and dark blue eyes gave him somewhat of a poetic aspect, while a slight depression of the brows and"], [245, "A WEDDING BREAKFAST. 237 a few not ungraceful wrinkles upon his forehead, indicated a thoughtful and ardent nature, only requiring to be directed into a worthy channel to bring its owner respect, sympathy, and fame. Time, and the hour, bring the longest days to an end, and at last came the welcome wedding morn, and Jack came to claim his bride from Uzelli, who shook his finger at Edie in sham displeasure, grinning all the while, with his study cap rakishly stuck on one side of his bald wrinkled head, and whispering to an old artist at his side that Edie had lost his heart and head also. In fact, Edie was evidently quite bewildered with happiness ; and I believe there is great truth in the assertion that a man loves more passionately at his age than the mere youth who has barely passed his teens. There is, doubtless, much sentiment in the youth's choice, but with the man of more mature years, it is generaUy a more absorbing feeling. He has, perhaps, looked long for his ideal, and the so-caUed love at first sight is in reality nothing more than the realisation of 6ome long-oherished dream, which we seize eagerly"], [246, "238 LOST FOOTSTEPS. because we had despaired of its ever becoming a reality. Edie had seen life under an aspect which was uninviting, and especially so as regarded the other sex. The vanity and caprice of the sex when developed by ignorance and flippant companion ship is hateful in the extreme to a man of heart and taste. He may, in the absence of nobler specimens of the sex, amuse himseH with such for a time ; but rarely, indeed, does he marry them, and it is especiaUy this forward class of girls that causes so many bachelors. Men laugh, for the moment, at their absur dities and small-talk ; but the idea of being chained for hfe to such companions alarms them. Many a time had Edie been drawn into temporary familiarity with a girl of this stamp ; but the enchantment which seemed to belong to her disappeared upon a nearer approach, and he was heart-whole again. It had been a fancy of UzelH's that Cecily should bp dressed as nearly as was consistent"], [247, "239 A WEDDING BREAKFAST. with modern millinery ideas to the portrait he had painted of her in the scene from the \" Tempest,\" and, much as the nobleman who had purchased the work wished to have it home, Uzelli would not consent to part with it till the wedding was over. It was associated with the happiest year of the old painter's life. Many a long day had he sat in his grimy studio, and bored himself with experiments in High Art, which, when he had covered acres of canvas, brought him barely enough to keep body and soul together. It seemed a mystery to the old man, that since he had adopted Cecily, nobody ever complained of his coloring, which once used to be a stock subject for ridi cule. Nobody now quizzed the unearthly manner or the violent attitudes of his figures. Unconsciously to himseH there was a fuUness and freedom in his work which he had toiled for ineffectually in other days. The truth was the man was happy, and the author of this story believes in happiness above aU things in the development of pure art.

So the main feature in the decoration of the drawing-room on the morning of the wed ding was the large picture of the \" Tempest,\" and it was from no vanity in his work, but simply in the depth of his affection for his adopted child. He could hardly honour her enough for the new feehngs with which she had inspired him, and he looked forward in her marriage to reaHze the peaceful happiness of a weU- ordered and prosperous home. There is not much to dweU upon in the wedding arrangements. Cecily positively re fused to aUow the old man to spend more upon"], [249, "241 A WEDDING EREAKFAST. herself. Nor, indeed, as Jack said at the wed ding breakfast, was it aU neeessary, for it was hardly possible for a young bride to look prettier than Cecily did, or to feel more hopeful and happy ; and when after the breakfast was weU nigh over, and UzeUi remembered that he would be alone in the house where he had spent so many dreary years, he was almost inclined to beg them to take no wedding tour, lest he might relapse into his old moody, fitful, impatient habits. And when they drank his health, and he stood up to return thanks, the remembrance of those gloomy years of disappointment, when he was laughed at or unappreciated, made him for the moment sad, when the bare possibihty that such a time could come again flashed upon his mind. \" A speech, Uzelli ; a speech, old boy,\" cried some of his old companions, who were astonished as himseH at the transformation in him. \" Diable, how can I speak ven I feel too moche ? \" wag the answer.

ObHvious, as the worthy merchant was upon most topics, he could hardly fad to notice that at times his beloved daughter was wonderfuUy absent and meditative, and sometimes when he -'frew his chair to her side, in his favorite summer-house, and after a long \u2014 a very long \u2014 interval of silence put some question to her in the briefest of monosyllables, he received no answer. Sometimes, in these abstracted moods she would sit for hours by herself lost in a reverie, until the very persons and places that formed her imaginative dreams seemed palpably before her. One day especially, she had been sitting thus, her mind insensibly carried back to some past scenes. It was in the early part of the evening, and a fire had been Hghted to counter act a fog from the canal. Never had she been so abstracted. Old faces flashed upon her in the flickering firelight; old hopes and aspira-"], [258, "250 LOST FOOTSTEPS. tions came afresh to her memory from the years that were gone ; sweet tones that had touched her heart in those days, seemed now to echo faintly in her ears ; bright looks and sunny smiles now, perhaps as she thought, lost to her for ever, came vividly to the mind's eye. It was growing late and the moon, which rose round and full when the fog cleared away, streamed brilliantly into the chamber. Mynheeer, who could not bear to be long absent from Louise, came into the chamber, but as he ap proached his daughter she seemed to be asleep, and he calmly sat down to wait till she awoke. He had been sitting but a few minutes thus, when it struck him that an unusual shadow feU across the floor of the room, which seemed to come from the direction of the window.

It is your lean and sallow folks who belong to the superstitious order, and we will not in-"], [259, "251 AT ROTTERDAM AGAIN. suit Mynheer by supposing that he had any idea of ghosts or phantoms. The glance that he had was so sudden, that he could not be certain, but he fancied it must surely have been a human face. But why anybody should be standing there gazing upon his sleeping Louise, was a mystery far beyond his compre hension, and now he came to think about not at all a pleasant mystery either. Was it some trick of Madame Morel, who, having failed in gaining her object openly, was bent upon some underhand man\u0153uvre ? Or, again, was it merely a vagrant, who had been watching their movements, and was bent upon helping himself to some of the contents of the apartment. Vagrants are, happily for the Dutch, by no meVms so common as they are here, and the people have a reasonable dislike of them, and take great precautions for keep ing them at bay. Mynheer, who was himself a magistrate, though one of the most benevolent of men, had a wholesome horror of the vaga bond class who had no settled home or definite"], [260, "252 LOST FOOTSTEPS. occupation. It did not occur to him, however, till he had given the tramp time enough to get half-a-mile away, that if he went round to the back of the house he might be able to see who it was. Without awakening Louise, Mynheer, stirred to unwonted activity, called one of the servants, and murmured his sus picions ; but the domestic assured him that not a soul had been in the garden, but themselves, and, as to tramps or vagrants, Mynheer's dislike of them was so well known, and his taste so scrupulously considered by the police, that not a tramp had been seen about the locality for months. Mynheer, however, still dissatisfied, made a sluggish inspection of the premises, and, coming back to the room where Louise was, without making any discovery, dropped breathless into his easy chair just as his daughter awoke. \" I have had a very strange dream, papa,\" said Louise, in a subdued tone. \" I have been dreaming of a face I shall, perhaps, never see again, for the owner of it is, in all probabdity,"], [261, "253 AT ROTTERDAM AGAIN. some hundreds of mdes away at this moment, and yet \" continued she in a tone which was even more subdued, and, in fact, scarcely audible to Mynheer himseH, \" it was a kind and honest face, and I would gladly have seen it again, if but for a moment.\" Mynheer looked at his daughter with the greatest astonishment. There was absolutely no scope in Mynheer's imagination for the con sideration of these metaphysical kind of ideas. He could not, for the Hfe of him, make out what relation there could be, or should be, between his daughter's vision and the person looking in at the window. Yet, when he told er what he had seen, or rather fancied he had seen, his daughter's eager questions upon the subject quite dumbfoundered him. If his daughter had a dream, that was one idea, thought Mynheer ; and if a man looked in at the window \u2014 perhaps intending some mischief \u2014 that was another idea ; but how the two could blend or have any connexion with each other, as they evidently seemed to have in his"], [262, "254 LOST FOOTSTEPS. daughter's mind, was a mystery the most com' plex of all. Throughout the next day Louise moved about the house, or wandered in the garden like one in a dream. When her father told her the strange circumstance of their being, as he sup posed, watched, and of his failuie to discover anybody upon the premises, the narration had affected her strongly. The momentary glance Mynheer had caught of the intruder, coupled with his own slowness in action, had been insufficient to give any idea of the cha racter, or even the sex of the stranger, but a possibility crossed the mind of Louise which caused her a strange agitation. Now for the first time, she acknowledged to herself how completely Adrian held possession of her heart and how utterly ineffectual had been her at tempt to suppress her memories of him. There are moments in the experiences of most of us, notwithstanding the prosaio surroundings of our daily life, and the deadening effect of habit and custom upon the imagination, when we are"], [263, "255 AT ROTTERDAM AGAIN. led to believe that the soul has been appealed to by other influences than those merely of sight, sound, or touch. I do not write this with any deference to so-called \" spiritual manifestations,\" the spirituality of which is about on a par with the jugglery of the street conjuror. I allude rather to that nameless inexpressible seeling which induces one at a particular moment to anxiously shun, or as unreservedly engage in any special course of action ; which fills our minds, whether we will or no, with memories of attached friends we may not have seen for years ; which awakens forebodings that induce us to change our plans and adopt an entirely new course upon the very threshold of a pro jected enterprise ; which lead us on as with the grasp of an invisible hand beyond the boundaries controlled by our own will. So strongly was Louise influenced by feelings similar to those we have attempted to describe, that she made an attempt to discuss the sub ject with her father, and when they were seated together according to custom after dinner,"], [264, "256 LOST FOOTSTEPS. and Mynheer proposing an adjournment to the summer house, had taken his forty winks and seemed invigorated and refreshed enough to be equal to the topic, Louise broached it in the hope that it might lead to something. \" You remember dear father, the young artist who came into your office for some time,\" Louise began timidly to say. Mynheer nodded. \" I think you were attached to him.\" Again there was a nod, and Mynheer pointing with his fat forefinger toward the portrait Adrian had painted of Louise, looked pleasantly at the picture and then at Louise, as if to compare the likeness, and once more nodded again. \" Had you any reason to think that Mr. Adrian Hope quitted Rotterdam in consequence of my marriage?\" Mynheer was posed. He took his meerschaum from his Hps, and considered without moving a muscle, for about ten minutes, when fearing it might go out, he puffed vigourously for a few seconds, and then unable stiU to reply"], [265, "257 AT ROTTERDAM AGAIN. took a turn round the tuhp beds and stared abstractedly at the canal. But he was no nearer a solution of the problem than ever. The question seemed to ramify itseH the more the longer he considered it. For what reason should Adrian Hope leave Rotterdam ? Was it not that art seemed more attractive than the inspec tion of piles of timber loading and unloading. Why should a young gentleman with so much talent as his portrait of Louise evinced, sit upon a stool at an office desk, and unravel compli cated accounts and post entries in ledgers. Of course it was perfectly natural that Mr. Hope would become disgusted with the mechanical routine of a merchant's office and go back to his former profession. He therefore came back and sat down by her side, looked in her face and shook his head most decidedly. Louise smiled to perceive how slow her fa ther's comprehension was in matters that did not faU immediately within his view, and then proceeded to overwhelm that placid gentleman by her next remarks.

Yet the worthy merchant recovered himself after a time, and motioned his daughter to proceed. \" Partly from diffidence, partly from the fear that he had not awakened my interest in him to such an extent, as to justify him in speaking plainly as to the state of his feeHngs, he allowed me to become engaged to M.

I am induced to dweU upon the memory of Adrian Hope especially to-day, be cause I cannot help feeling that in some un accountable way I am drawn to him more than I have ever been.

He merely motioned Adrian to a seat in the summer-house in the same way he had done when Adrian saw him for the first time, and indeed for any change in his outward man he might have been sitting in the same place ever since. But the effect upon Louise was very different. The first glance at Adrian, the recollection of all that had passed between them flashing upon her mind in a single instant, the unmistakeable purpose plainly showing in his eager face deprived her of aU ordinary command of her feelings, and unable to speak, scarcely to breathe, she sank back in her chair and fainted. To Hft her up and carry her to a seat in the open air was but the work of a few seconds ; but it was a considerable time ere Adrian could trust himself to speak of the feelings nearest his heart.

I should not be surprised if my first impression proved to be the correct one.\" \" Perhaps Mr. Littleton will call again sir.\" Scarcely had Mrs. Crankley uttered the words, when a knock was heard at the door, and young Littleton was there. \" I am very glad, Mr. Hope, that you have not gone out this morning, for I wish to say a few words upon a subject that concerns me deeply,\" said the young man. \" I shall be pleased H I can do you any service,\" said Percival Hope, not dreaming what Frank's errand was. \" You may have guessed, my dear sir, what has brought me to your house so often,\" said the young man modestly ; \" some months since, I was a constant visitor, and would have continued to accept your hospitality, but the state of my feelings \" \" Really papa this is too absurd,\" cried Maude, breaking in upon them suddenly, \" I cannot imagine what could have induced Mr. Littleton to suppose I had given him any encouragement\""], [278, "270 LOST FOOT8TEPS. \" I think if I were Mr. Littleton,\" said the curate gravely, \" I should consider a little before I made a proposition to such a capricious girl a* you are, Maude, and I should advise you to be more cautious in future how you behave to re spectable well-conducted neighbours.\" Percival Hope was generally so indulgent that he rarely spoke reproachfully, and his words and manner brought the tears into Maude's eyes, and she rushed from the room. The episode was by no means unfavorable for Frank Littleton, and we have reason to know that before leaving the house the young man had made such good use of his time as to have obtained the wilful young beauty's confession that she was not indifferent to him. As for Adrian and Louise they lingered all the day in the quaint old garden at Rotterdam, and Mynheer Kalm seeing them so engrossed with eaoh other, spent the greater part of his time at the wharf, where Kloots, who had mysteriously dis covered how matters stood, treated the workmen to such frequent libations in anticipation of possible"], [279, "ALL'S WFLL THAT ENDS WELL. 271 events, that poor Mynheer could hardly get a moment's peace, and was glad to take refuge at an ancient hostel, where he occasionally met sundry magnates of the Rotterdam corporation to report upon official matters connected with pile-driving, dam-stopping, and so forth. In this respectable estabHshment Mynheer's habits were well known, and no sooner did he make his appearance than a substantial jorum, together with a well-used meerschaum, was sent up to a certain snuggery never invaded by the vulgar, and there Mynheer sat in state, and chuckled portentously over his daughter's happiness tdl vanquished by Schiedam and fatigue, he dropped into a peacefnl slumber. The hanging committee at Trafalgar Square had dealt kindly by Adrian, and his Italian Festa with which Mr. Joyce was thoroughly delighted, had been placed in a capital position. All the principal journals were unanimous in praise of it, and many a column of high flown art criticism had been devoted to it, not a word of which did Adrian read. His sole care respecting it, was whether it pleased the general public and the few friends who were"], [280, "272 LOST FOOTSTEPS. most competent to judge of its merits. Through the influence of Louise he had put forth his utmost powers, and he counted upon her recognition of his talent most of all. He would have preferred after all that had taken place in the past, to have brought Louise to Eng land, and for their marriage to have been celebrated at the old church of Molton, but Mynheer could not be moved upon this point. It was evident he would never be persuaded any more to leave his beloved Rotterdam. Not all the glories of the Rhine or Switzerland, vineyard, glacier, Alp or waterfall, nor the pleasant hills of Surrey, clad with heather, and peeping out from some of the lovehest lanes in the world, could wean Mynheer from the delights of his smooth lawn, his placid canal, fish ponds, and tulips, and the daily visit to the sombre old wharf, presided over by Kloots. Besides, he was determined Louise should not be out of his sight any more. He was wealthy, and never enquired for a moment whether Adrian would have any fortune or not, though Martin, proud of his son, had insisted upon a settlement"], [281, "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL. 273 whioh astonished the young painter, ignorant as he had been of his father's resources. The con sequence was that Adrian somewhat unwiUingly, it must be confessed, was compelled, to take up his residence at Rotterdam, and the preparations for the wedding went merily on. On the day before the marriage, Louise received a visitor she hardly expected. She was summoned to the drawing-room to see a lady, who would not give her name, but who, immediately Louise en tered, fell upon her neck, and embraced her with every appearanoe of genuine affeotion. It was Madame Morel. \" And my darling Louise wiU permit me to be one of the guests upon the occasion of her marriage, I am well assured,\" said Madame with muoh warmth. Louise was at first a Httle staggered by this proposition, and the embarrassment of the situation was increased by the appearance of her father at the instant. \" My feheity is complete,\" said Madame, looking with a smiling expression at the vaoant and Ib VOL.

She believed also that Adrian would be secretly annoyed at the presence of this woman who had plotted and schemed for her own purposes to the very latest moment. Madame read her thoughts like a book, and answered them as though they had been spoken : \" My darling Louise is fortunately in ignoranoe of many things which are but too famdiar to more worldly people. Has the dear girl evei known"], [283, "ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL. 275 what it was to live in some furnished lodging without the means of paying a clamorous landlady, tapping at the chamber every week for her miser able rent ? Certainly my darling Louise has not, and God be thanked, it is so. Has my dearest Louise known what it was to have a son bound up with every fibre of her heart, but a son who did not love her, and wasted viciously every sous of the money she obtained for him by tricks and schemes. My sweet Louise has been spared this, but she wiU know also what it is to be a solitary woman, fighting the world alone, without money, without friends, and without credit. Think of this, my darhng, and forgive me, who have injured you so much.\" Madame put her handkerohief to her eyes, and shed a few genuine tears. Louise was far too tender-hearted to trample upon a faUen foe, and readdy promised that she should be one of the guests at the wedding, and used her influenoe with Adrian bo effectuaUy that he met Madame before she left the house, and if he did not treat her with quite the friendliness of Louise, was at least civil."], [284, "276 LOST FOOTSTEPS. It was a lively wedding, indeed, and Madame Morel did her utmost to infuse gaiety into the proceedings. She bribed Kloots secretly, and drilled the workmen at the wharf in a serenade until the possibility of a false chord was out of the question, and when the nuptial party came baok to the wedding breakfast, a chorus of melodious thunder greeted them from a gaily decorated barge upon the canal, a compliment which gratified Mynheer beyond measure. She won over her old antagonist, Mr. Joyce, who of course was present, and when the bride and bridegroom had gone off for the honeymoon tour, a dance was improvised, and the old lawyer was Madame's first partner, followed, by Mynheer himseH, who had never in the memory of the oldest inhabitant been seen to foot it in a quadrille before, though Mr. Vander beck, who knew more about Mynheer than anybody else, asserted that in their younger days when they were shm young feUows of twenty, and more sedate dances were in vogue, they had often gone together to a ball.

The noble man who had purchased it, knew UzelH's pro pensity to touch and re-touch in past days, and the picture as it was, seemed to the purchaser so satisfactory, that he was determined to have it home without another moment's delay, and or dered the van to wait in a neighbouring street, and draw up at Uzelli's door the instant the wedding party disappeared.

Every footstep of the men as they lffted it off the easel, filled him with agitation, and when it was placed in the van, Uzelli, forgetful of his remaining guests, walked beside the vehicle in his smoking cap through the muddy streets, and would not quit his work till he saw it safely hung in the gallery which was to be its destination. \" Got dam !
