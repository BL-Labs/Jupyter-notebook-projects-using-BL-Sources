Every fly at the railway station had been engaged to bring visitors to Mr. Shirley's private residence, and more than one carriage had been seen in the quiet lanes. There were other visitors than city men to-day, for the West End contributed also to swell the number of guests, and it was no little astonishment to some titled gen tlemen from Belgravia, to find such VOL III.

A grand project was in contemplation at the Chingford Villa, and as nothing can be done in England without a dinner to begin with, Mr. Shirley determined to invite these gentlemen to dine first, and afterwards to unfold the scheme he had in view. This was simply to transform the firm of Shirley and Son into \" The Colonial Produce Company, Limited,\" a remarkably easy and agreeable way of staving off that ruin, which could not otherwise be delayed. I wish I could inform the reader what number of shares it was proposed to issue, and of what amount, but unfortunately, so many a fair prospectus has found its way to the flames latterly, that I fear the one"], [11, "3 LIMITED LIABILITY. in question, has also served to light the fire. However, it was intended, of course, to raise a great deal of money, which was to be expended \" partly in purchasing the old established business of Shirley and Son, and forming it into a company without delay.\" The directors were happy to state that the well-known financier, Lord Dufferly, would be chairman of the board. That Messrs. Walter Shirley, senior, and Walter Shirley, junior, would be direc tors ; also, that George Harland, Esq., merchant, of London and Merton, Ox fordshire, would become a director, with other important and distinguished mem bers of the commercial and aristocratic world. Considering the vast extent of the business transacted by this old commercial house, it was proposed that the directors received for their services b 2"], [12, "4 MARTYRS TO FASHION. the sum of one thousand pounds per annum, and that the old servants of the firm be retained ; and the directors had also the great satisfaction to announce that the eminent bankers, Tightfit and Bland, would transact the business of the \" Colonial Produce Company, Limited,\" and also, as it was whispered at the dinner table, discount the paper of the company without any restriction. \" The great success with which the firm of Shirley and Son had been con ducted,\" said Lord Dufferly, in his little after-dinner speech, when he introduced the subject to the guests, and offered the shares of the under taking, \" was in itself a guarantee of a handsome dividend to the shareholders. He did not wish to be sanguine (no director, shareholder, chairman, or paid"], [13, "5 LIMITED LIABILITY. clerk of a company ever is), but he believed he might say, judging by the extent of the transactions already, and the unbounded field which opened to them, in supplying the large demand for colonial produce, that a dividend of at least fifteen per cent, was absolutely certain. Few companies started on so sound a basis as \" The Colonial Produce Company, Limited,\" few were so little restricted in their range of business. He was not acquainted with commercial details him self, but he had been informed upon the very best authority, that in such commo dities as currants, rice, sago, and tapioca, there was practically no limit to the amount of business which could be done. Was it for them to lock up their funds in acres of barren land, which barely returned them two per cent., when a golden harvest was awaiting them from"], [14, "6 MARTYRS TO FASHION. tapioca ? Would they, as men of com mon sense, allow their capital to lie dormant in banks and ground rents, in waterworks and railways, when twenty per cent, was lurking in currants ? Certainly not.\" This speech of Lord Dufferly was so well received, that a large number of shares were subscribed for ' there and then. No questions were asked, for it appeared, just at that time, as if the very name of a company was a guarantee for immense interest upon capital. New schemes were brought forward hourly \u2014 nothing was too hot for the coolness of a promoter, or too heavy for the resources of a director. It was only to catch a lord, and half-a-dozen directors, men whose names had been advertised a little. It was enough for shareholders generally, that John Smith, Esq., or William"], [15, "7 LIMITED LIABILITY. Tompkins, Esq., could be seen in the various daily papers, and that the shares were quoted at a premium. George Harland was staggered when the proposition had been made to him, to become a director, at a thousand a year. He was strange to London modes of doing business, but when his uncle assured him that in a short time it was probable that every kind of business would be transacted by a company, and when he read in the papers every day reports of companies, all paying dividends, some of twenty, some even of fifty per cent., it did seem as though his brother Gilbert was wasting his time at Merton. He wrote to Gilbert immediately the company was formed, inviting him to take shares, and sending him papers with accounts of meetings, &c. At first Gilbert turned a deaf ear to all this,"], [16, "8 MARTYRS TO FASHION. but there was a secret temptation he could hardly resist in the prospect. Annie Warren was at home again, but the friendly and affectionate feeling of old seemed utterly gone. Michael War ren could hardly, after all that had passed actually forbid him the house, but it was very certain that Annie avoided him, and the farmer, sulky with his own mortifications, would sometimes not speak to him at all. His brother, director of a company, at a thou sand a year ! why, in three years, he would receive back his capital invested. He could trust his brother of course ; George had always seemed quick-witted enough, and his uncle Shirley had been extremely kind. The one difficulty with Annie would be smoothed away with a thousand a year, for his uncle's influence would, perhaps, be sufficient to get him also on the board."], [17, "LIMITED LIABILITY. 9 Full of the idea, he called upon the paper maker, Compton, who had always fancied the timber dealer's premises, and wished to erect a second mill there. The stock of timber and goodwill of the business, would be worth, at least, seven or eight thousand pounds. The premises were freehold, and if he let them on lease, at a handsome ground rent, that would be a living for his mother, and then came the chief motive that in fluenced him \u2014 would Annie refuse him with a thousand a year ? He was convinced she would not. With a thousand a year, one could do almost anything, such was Gilbert Harland' s exaggerated idea. For himself, he had not the slightest ambition for smart dress, smart furniture, or smart company. He would have been contented and happy, as his father had been before"], [18, "10 MARTYRS TO FASHION. him, to w7ork hard and live plainly. In reality, he despised, as we know by his conversations with Annie, the flashy costume and the slangy manners of the day, and preferred simple, straightforward work, as a means of gaining his daily bread, before any schemes, or artificial modes of making money. But it requires immense self-reliance not to go with the tide, especially when one's ideas are influenced by a passionate affection for a pretty girl, who craves all sorts of graceful and delicate surroundings, which can only be obtained with money, and enough of it. He saw plainly, now, that Annie would not, and could not be happy in narrow circumstances, and he began, himself, to consider whether he would admire her as much, if, instead of the charming dresses she wore, he saw her daily in a homely dowdy costume,"], [19, "LIMITED LIABILITY, 11 ill-fitting, and of coarse material. The little nicknacks and ornaments she always wore, seemed to suit her uncommonly well, and it was an agreeable relief to see her to-day in one kind of dress, and to-morrow in another. All this need not be dispensed with, if he had a thousand a year. She was fond, too, of giving little parties, and making presents, and buying all the new songs, and subscribing to the local charities. One might get a great deal of this sort of thing out of a thousand a year. So impressed was Gilbert with the future before him, withal so hopeful, that he paid a visit at once to the Mount Farm, and discussed the subject with Mr. Warren. Gilbert could not but remark the sudden thaw in the farmer's manner, when he had read George's letter."], [20, "12 MARTYRS TO FASHION. His reception had even been more ungracious than usual, and it was with some difficulty that Gilbert prevailed upon him to read the letter, but the immediate change in his manner, when the prospect dawned upon him that Gilbert might, after all, become a rich man, was laughable in the extreme. He was a little surprised, too, at the actual position of the Harlands. He had always considered them poor people. In fact, Gilbert's wooing had been so free from pretence, that he had as yet not even made the farmer acquainted with the value of his timber business and stock. Another idea entered the farmer's mind while he read George Harland's letter. Could not he, Michael Warren, be a director of a company ? He sounded Gilbert thereupon at once, and Gilbert,"], [21, "LIMITED LIABILITY. 13 only too happy to find his course of true love likely to flow in a smoother channel, promised to write to his brother for further particulars, that very day. In the meantime, \" The Colonial Produce Company, Limited,\" progressed swimmingly. George's little capital was, of course, now paid back to him in shares of the company, and so rapidly did the undertaking meet public favor, that he might have made a thousand pounds by selling his shares, within ten days after the first advertisement in the Times. But it is pleasant to have a little power, and George was not displeased when important-looking city men called, and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing his name upon the board of this and that company. He was amused, too, when quiet country gentlemen solicited"], [22, "14 MARTYRS TO FASHION. an interview with him, and craved his advice as to investments for the savings of a lifetime, and when architects and builders consulted him as to the arrange ments for new premises. Of course the buildings in St. Mary Axe were discarded by the company, though com modious enough to have done five times the business ever transacted by Shirley and Son. If ever George entertained a doubt as to the solvency of his uncle, that feeling was entirely banished when he saw the eagerness with which the shares were taken up. He was not aware of the extent of the mania which had seized the public mind, and attributed the success to the tangible value of Shirley and Son's business. It was not a little gratifying to be a director of such a flourishing concern, and he wrote"], [23, "LIMITED LIABILITY. 15 again to Gilbert, urging him, if thera was any chance of Compton buying the timber yard, to close with the offer at once, and join him. Gilbert had caught the infection of the times, like his brother. In spite of the remonstrances of the widow Harland, and in opposition to the advice of many old friends, he sold the timber yard to the paper maker, but his strict sense of justice made him careful that the risk, if any, should be entirely his own, and he therefore made terms with Compton, which secured his mother a living, come what would. Mr. Warren was greatly disappointed to find that the arrangements already made would not permit of his becoming a director. It would have suited him admirably. To have bounced and blus tered, and acted in the grand style"], [24, "16 MARTYRS TO FASHION. upon the property of others, would have been extremely congenial to his nature. Finding himself too late for this pur pose, he revenged himself by purchasing largely in shares of the company, though warned by George, who was already acquiring some financial knowledge, to be prepared for the calls wThen they became due. But the process seemed so easy. To buy hundred pound shares, by the payment of a pound or too upon allotment, and a call of five pounds in two or three months, was perfect child's play. If Michael Warren had only remembered at that moment, the diffi culty he experienced in raising the last year's rent ; but it was his way to forget a trouble or annoyance the moment it was over. He became the proud pos sessor of fifty shares in the new company,"], [25, "17 LIMITED LIABILITY. and there was not a single farmer within ten miles of Merton, but was made acquainted with the fact. What an important man he became once more, how loud he talked when he attended market, and how he domineered at any social gathering. Cruppy was perfectly bewildered by the grandeur of his manner, and betook himself oftener than usual to the \" Coach and Horses,\" to talk the matter over with his old cronies. Mrs. Higgins, also, was mystified. It was not the style farmers adopted when she was younger, and she could make nothing of these modern ways, but fell back upon her unfailing hope, that this, like everything else in the world, \" was for a wise purpose.\" In Walter Shirley's opinion, limited liability was the best system ever VOL.

If they go for advice to their friends, the only suggestion they are greeted with, is, \"put it in the funds, or buy a house with it,\" or some old fashioned system of that sort. Well, they buy a house, and don't get their rent, or the roof falls in, or the main drainage system falls foul of them, and puts them to no end of expense, and if they go to the funds, what interest do they get ? Now here in limited liability is a nice sort of ready-made providence for such people.

Poor Sandall fretted greatly at the loss. of his daughter. He was a thoughtless, foolish man, perhaps, but there was a vein of tenderness in his nature, and it had all been lavished upon Caroline. He saw in her something of the bright- ness and gladness of his lost ideal. She was a link between him and the world, which now being removed, seemed to condemn him to exile, for he was not a man to propitiate others. If a pupil bungled, Sandall called him a fool without the slightest hesitation. K he painted a sketch for a farmer or trades man, and any fault was found with it when he took it home, he would most"], [30, "22 MARTYRS TO FASHION. likely carry it back again, and never return it. He often reproached himself in his solitude with the manner in which he had trained Caroline. He never could satisfy himself, now that she was gone, that he had done enough for her. He forgot all her petulant ways, all her pride and caprice ; he only remembered the pretty girl who was the companion of his sketching rambles. He never sketched now. Since her marriage, the poor artist fell into a melancholy state, sometimes being so forgetful and wan dering, that he was hardly in his right senses. He had still one constant, earnest friend in Laura Mostyn, but she per ceived, with pain, that he was hardly able to take care of himself. She called upon him constantly, and always"], [31, "Caroline's first grief. 23 came with some present, to add to his comfort, and listened by the hour together, when he was in his dreamy moods. One day when she called, she found him really ill. His mind wan dered, but he rambled chiefly about his art and his daughter. \"Ah, Miss Mostyn, you are exceedingly kind,\" he said, \"but I wish you would persuade Caroline to come down and see me. She is very forgetful of her poor old father. If I could have given her a fortune she would have been more affectionate, perhaps. But it is not given to everybody to paint like Turner, Stanfield, or Landseer, and how many are there who might have been great if they could only have waited.\" Then the artist, who was compelled to keep his bed, wandered away to some youthful memories, which had no mean-"], [32, "24 MARTYRS TO FASHION. ing for Miss Mostyn. At last, he seemed to remember that someone was in the room, and muttered something about a landscape. She leaned down to him, and tried hard to understand what he meant, but he seemed so weak and imbecile, that he could only point to the adjoining room. Laura, compassionating his helpless state, ran eagerly to the next room, in the hope of discovering what he wanted, but the room had a very un promising appearance. Evidently, at one time, he had used the place as a studio, but it was now thoroughly neglected, full of dust and cobwebs. A critical notice of one of his works was pasted upon the wall, with the date affixed, as though the artist had an idea that it Avould stimulate him in his labors, but the room looked as though"], [33, "CAROLINE'S FIRST GRIEF. 25 it had not been used for years. Puzzled as to Sandall's meaning, she was about to come back to him, and ask him again what he wanted, when her eyes fell upon a package of considerable size, which looked as though it contained a picture. Fancying this was what the painter wanted, she hastily unpacked it, covering herself with dust as she did so. When the wrappings were off, she saw it was a really exquisite landscape and placed it against the wall, lost in admiration. It was a view on the Thames at sunset, taken from a spot a few miles from Merton, where the river bent gracefully round, beneath a bold range of hills, covered with dense foliage on the one side, while upon the other, a wide expanse of undulating scenery formed a glorious contrast to the pic turesque foreground."], [34, "26 MARTYRS TO FASHION. As Laura gazed upon the picture, her eyes filled with tears. She was so keenly alive to everything that was beautiful, and it seemed to her so truly sad that such exquisite talent should be lost to the world. Meanwhile, Sandall's faculties were clearing up a little, and he called, in a weak voice from the other room \u2014 \"May I trouble you, Miss Mostyn, to bring a landscape there is in that room. I fear it is very dirty, but I should like to see it again, it has been there for nearly twenty years. Good God ! how happy I was when I painted that ; how many days did I spend from dawn till dusk, watching all the various lights of dawn, noon, and sunset, till I satisfied myself under what aspect it would look best.\" Miss Mostyn, with no little effort,"], [35, "CAROLINE'S FIRST GRIEF. 27 brought the picture to the artist's bed side, and set it upon a chair, so that he might see it. He raised himself in bed, and looked at it long and earnestly. \" Perhaps it might sell now,\" he murmured thoughtfully. \" I wonder why it was returned. Didn't catch the popular taste, I suppose. Perhaps it would go down now. There will be a market for big pictures some day, I shouldn't wonder. Will you keep my poor landscape, Miss Mostyn ?\" \" That I will, with pleasure, Mr. Sandall.\" \" Somebody might make an offer for it in time, and Caroline will be glad to know that her old dad painted one picture that wasn't contemptible.\" \" If you will only name your own price, Mr. Sandall,\" said Laura, \"I will buy the picture. I consider it simply"], [36, "28 MARTYRS TO FASHION. beautiful, and should be proud to possess it. I had no idea that you were such a painter as that proves you to be.\" \" You would buy it from charity,\" said the artist, faintly. \" You are an angel of goodness, Miss Mostyn, but I won't have charity from anybody.\" \"Don't distress yourself, Mr. Sandall, I'll talk the matter over with Caroline.\" \" Have you heard from her lately ?\" asked Sandall, rousing himself. \" I hope she is happy in her marriage, but I was never much impressed by that Captain Mellor. He was too flippant and worldly for my taste. If I get better, and go to London, I wonder if he would make me welcome. I know so little of fashionable manners.

I shall never see her again, I believe. Give her my blessing, it is all I have to give her.\" \" You must not be desponding,\" said Laura, kindly, \" the winter will soon be over, and then you will get out of doors, and feel yourself again. You shall paint me a landscape as a com panion to this, but I will have my own choice of subject, mind.\" Sandall put out his weak, trembling hand, as though seeking for something. Laura came a little nearer, and he took her hand, and put it to his lips. \" You have seen the best and worst of me,\" he said, almost in a whisper, \"God bless you.\" While he spoke, Laura observed a great alteration in his expression. He babbled some unintelligible words, having reference to his art, or the painting"], [38, "30 MARTYRS TO FASHION. beside him. Laura could not understand which. In a moment the thought en tered her mind that the poor artist was very near~his end. She had never wit nessed death herself, and with her rich glow of health, and her warm, large heart, it seemed to her inexpressibly sad that he should die like this. There was no cottage near, and no one passing, and she was afraid to leave him. She went once more to the bedside, and looked at him. He was so still, that at first it seemed as though he was really dead. Alarmed at this, she went to the cottage door, and this time, to her great joy, saw someone coming that way. She waited at the door, till a well dressed, handsome man came up, who bowed politely, and was about to pass on, when Laura stepped out and spoke to him."], [39, "CAROLINE'S FIRST GRIEF. 31 \" There is a person lying here dan gerously ill, I fear. I am alone with him, and quite ignorant what should be done; will you kindly step in and give me your opinion, and assistance.\" \"It is my profession, madame,\" said the stranger, bowing again, and speaking in a slightly foreign accent, and evidently astonished at her great beauty, he fol lowed her into the house. He approached the side of the bed, felt Sandall's pulse, and sitting down, looked at him earnestly for some time. Though the first sight of Laura had evidently impressed him deeply, pro fessional habit so far influenced him, that he sat watching the poor artist, apparently unconscious of her presence. \" Some stimulants might revive him for a time, but it will not be for long.\" Laura looked about the little cottage,"], [40, "32 MARTYRS TO FASHION. but there was nothing to be found.

He was confirmed in his opinion that poor Sandall's tide of life was fast ebbing"], [41, "Caroline's first grief. 33 away. There was nothing that could be done, beyond giving him momentary relief. Santi looked round the bare and miserable room, wondering more and more to see such a picture as that which stood upon the chair by the artist's bedside. Wondering, too, at the anxiety of that beautiful woman, and thinking how like she was to a portrait of Giorgione, he had seen in a gallery at Rome. Remembering, too, how he had said, if he could ever see a woman like that, he would ask her to be his wife. That was but a boyish fancy, and he had never seen his ideal, or anything like it, before. But this lady came out of charity, of course, to visit the poor dying man.

In an incredibly short time, Laura came back, bringing a servant with her, laden with w7ine, fruits, jellies, and other good things, but Santi took only a little brandy in a teaspoon, and applied it to Sandall's lips. It revived him for a few seconds ; he opened his eyes and looked wildly about him, but did not speak. Then his eyes settled upon the picture, and a glowing smile passed over his face, as if he had recognized a dear friend. \"One can see that he painted that,\" said Santi, in a gentle tone, so tender and sympathetic, that Laura's heart warmed to him at once. The smile that lighted up the features of the dying artist, was like the fading glow that tinged the subject of his picture. Night must follow, and that soon.

She, however, tele graphed at once, warning her that he was dangerously ill. The new7s came at an unfortunate time. Caroline was shrewd enough in her judgment of character, and she had been too accustomed to a make-shift life to be long in discovering the un certainty of Captain Mellor's ways and means. As for that gentleman, he was not much moved by Caroline's evident knowledge of his circumstances. He adopted his usual philosophy, trusting that some favourable chance would turn in his favor, and spare him any great trouble in the matter. He had so often been picked up and put on his d 2"], [44, "36 MARTYRS TO FASHION. legs by that capricious nurse, Fortune, that he felt himself warranted in trusting to her yet. He was like many, who, when they are in a position which is occasioned by their own cowardice or folly, think only of the chances that may release them. He was almost confirmed in the belief that his indis cretions served him best. With grave doubts as to her future, when she returned to town, Caroline went down to Merton, to learn that the poor, shambling, careless, kindly artist was gone. She had been too thoughtless, too flippant, herself, to bestow much care upon him while he lived, but now it was too late, many bitter thoughts crowded upon her, and she made no secret to Laura of her regret for her past conduct. \"If I had listened to him, it would"], [45, "CAROLINE'S FIRST GRIEF. 37 have made me happier all my life,\" said Caroline, with genuine grief. But it was unavailing now. The future did not look promising for Caroline. She could not even pay the expenses of her father's funeral. Laura wondered that Captain Mellor did not accompany his wrife, but he had made some plausible excuse that he could not leave town. The funeral over, Caroline went back to Jermyn Street, but her reception by Mrs. Torkey was anything but cordial. \" I was afear'd, ma'am, you wasn't a coming back again,\" said that lady, rigidly. \" Oh, of course I came back again. I don't know why you imagine that. I was not aware Captain Mellor had made any other arrangements.\" \" As to arrangements, ma'am, begging"], [46, "38 MARTYRS TO FASHION. your pardon, I think it is time he did make some sort of arrangement.

Captain Mellor will bear speaking to, if any man will.\" \" Don't be excited, Mrs. Torkey, I will speak to him myself, when he comes home.

Captain Mellor, too, knew the time the train came in, for she had written to him, but he had not met her at the station. He might have done that, thought poor Caroline, it is not so far from Jermyn Street to Paddington, but, perhaps, he had missed her, in which case he would be back directly. ' She rang the bell, and enquired of"], [48, "40 MARTYRS TO FASHION. the grubby maid what time the Captain had gone out. \" The Capting ain't been in the house these three days,\" said the girl. \"But he must have got my note?\" \" There was a note in a lady's writing, but we are used to them,\" the girl replied, in a matter-of-fact tone, not intending any rudeness. Caroline ran to the mantel-piece, and looked behind the dingy frame of the mirror, where any notes were usually placed by the girl. There, sure enough, was her own note, delivered the day before, but it was not opened.\" \" Good heavens ! something must have happened to him.\" \" I don't know, ma'am.\" said the girl, \" the Capting would often go away for days, the Capting would.\" \" Very likely, but not with a wife"], [49, "Caroline's first grief. 41 waiting for him,\" cried Caroline, pas sionately.

Her love of luxury was mainly the result of a refined taste. She did not wish merely to surpass her neighbours in fashionable extravagancies. If crinoline was the mode, she did not appear in larger skirts than anybody else, and if any friend, possessing ordinary judgment, had guided her, instead of a vain, childish woman, like her mother, it is probable, she would not have risked her happiness by inducing Gilbert to change his mode of life, through her prompting. For it must be confessed, that no sooner did she learn the change that was likely to take place in Gilbert's position, than she became less reserved and distant in her behaviour towards him. She did not, when he came, find"], [52, "44 MARTYRS TO FASHION. excuses to stay in her own room till he was gone, nor refrain, wrhen he was present, from joining in the conversation. Altogether, she looked better in health and happier than Gilbert had seen her for a long time, and he was full of spirits and extremely hopeful of the future, in consequence. He no longer attempted to reason with her, and advise her as he had done before, when he imagined that his future life and home would be the Merton timber yard, and he was fearing she might be unhappy with the homely surroundings of the place. It had grieved him to find fault with her, even more than it had grieved her to hear the condemnation, for there was nothing dearer to Gilbert Harland than a woman's honor. He would not willingly have lowered the repute of"], [53, "ANNIE IS WON. 45 the humblest of the sex. It was only when he felt that Annie, by dress and accomplishments beyond her station, was forfeiting some of her claim to his esteem, that he had blamed her. Had she resembled many of her sex, she would have simply laughed to scorn such old fashioned remonstrances as these, but she knew his opinion was worth having, and she evaded the actual objection, by many little graceful man\u0153uvres. She did not imagine she would make herself more attractive by copying the false red hair and painted eyebrows of a certain class of her sex, nor did she wish to emulate those who are flirted with by a weak-minded set of young gentlemen, who show them selves, however, not absolute idiots, by refraining to marry such women.

She did not desire money in preference to affection and pure happiness. She did not wish to live a life of utter idleness, and had not lost all sense of responsibility, like too many of her fair sisterhood. She was not prepared to pay any price for the gratification of a transient pleasure, or the indulgence of a pet vanity. There was a genuine modesty in her nature, even when she was most inclined to follow the madness of extreme fashion. Gilbert had seen what this want of restraint amongst the young girls of the day was fast leading to, and the ten dency to follow them, which he saw in"], [55, "47 ANNIE IS WON. Annie, had alarmed him, and as a right thinking honest man, with a plain unpretentious home to look forward to, we cannot wonder at him. He saw that parents ceased to have any autho rity over their children \u2014 less even with their daughters than their sons, for the young damsels threw off all restraint, becoming daily bolder in their language, and coarser in their manners. They seemed destitute of any tenderness of feeling, and apparently did not even understand such an antiquated idea as high principle and justice to others. He saw them ruining hard-working fathers, who had spent all their lives in unceasing drudgery. He saw them no longer gentle, unassuming or domes ticated ; indeed, they had lost that sweet home feeling, which was once the greatest charm of an Englishwoman,"], [56, "48 MARTYRS TO FASHION. and which made her the envy of other nations. The love of display led them away from home and its duties, and they sought abroad the morbid craving for admiration wrhich so fatally possessed them. To Gilbert, there was no more satisfaction in such a display, than in the plumage of those gorgeous, foreign birds, which attract the eye for a moment by the strangeness or splendour of their plumage, but soon disappoint us when we find they are no songsters, or if they have any note at all, it is merely a wild screech, more painful than melodious. Who would not, rather, in the long-run, be content with the innocent, homely, brown bird, that would make the wood land echo with its choice melodies, gladdening the heart, as much as they delighted the ear. Gilbert's plain com mon sense told him, that there were"], [57, "ANNIE IS WON. 49 many drawbacks to the delights of love in a cottage, and he would not have asked Annie to make any great sacrifice for him, but for the life of him, he could not see any happiness to be gained by indulging in such monstrous folly as he had witnessed during the few days * he wandered about the streets of London in search of her. There was just that drawback to be guarded against in the future. If he accepted his brother's proposition, and joined the \" Colonial Produce Company, Limited,\" and Annie married him, as he now hoped and believed she would, they must live in, or near London, and the thought of his wife visiting in a dress, below her shoulders, or with her hair hanging down, as though she had just escaped from a lunatic asylum, quite horrified him. He knew, too, that VOL. Ill e"], [58, "50 MARTYRS TO FASHION. there were great temptations to pleasure and luxury in the vicinity of London, and he sometimes wondered if Annie would give due consideration to the responsibilities and duties of married life. He, least of all men, would accept the fate which some husbands tamely submit to \u2014 that of being tolerated merely. However, Gilbert felt that the dangers of over-refinement were preferable to the blank, dull, joyless married lives of such as he knew in Merton. With Annie by his side, it would be his care to watch over her and protect her from any unfavourable influences. These thoughts, which had passed through his mind, had in no degree abated his love for her, or made him irresolute, but any thoughtful man, like Gilbert, would naturally weigh all the chances and risks of a given course of proceeding,"], [59, "51 ANNIE IS WON. even if determined beforehand to accept them. He had been bred up in a home, where many narrow prejudices chilled the warmth of the domestic hearth. His tenderness of heart and manly affection for his mother made him fall uncom plainingly into her habits and views. He inherited all her neatness and order liness, but he had often sighed for a little more sunshine, a little more society and cheerfulness. The widow was un flinching in every good work, but her life was spent without any grace or ease. From morning till night her delight was to scrub, to polish, to sweep, till there was not a spot or speck to be seen upon the homely furniture or. the sanded floor, for the widow Harland still regarded carpets with disdain, as modern inventions to conceal dirt and e2"], [60, "52 MARTYRS TO FASHION. encourage vermin, and excuse lazy wenches from scrubbing floors. It was, therefore, an exquisite change for Gilbert, when Annie came home from school, to visit frequently at the Mount Farm, and it was not till he knew more of Mr. Warren's affairs, and saw how inadequate his means were for the style he aimed at, that he warned Annie with the affectionate earnestness of a lover, and the freedom of a true friend. Something like that first change which had come over his mind upon renewing his acquaintance with Annie, after her return from boarding school, influenced him again, now, after the blank deso lation which it had been to him to lose her for a time ; and he was far too happy to see any cause for reproach, when she took his arm once more"], [61, "ANNIE IS WON. 53 and wandered in the pleasant lanes of Merton, as gay and thoughtless as a child. Gilbert, it is true, was still a long way from being that romantic hero of which she had dreamed. He was good looking, but his good looks were those of a blunt, solid Englishman, accustomed to look things in the face, and call things by their right names. He had a rooted hatred for overfine language, or overfine manners, but if he was not quite so smooth and polished as she would have liked, he had a good heart, and it would not be an altogether unpleasing office to take upon herself the task of varnishing over the rough points of his character.

There was a happy wedding in Merton. Mr. Warren did give five pounds and more to the ringers, as he had said he would, when that marriage with a baronet was in his mind, and he did not forget, either, to have the path leading from the church porch covered with carpet. The ringers rang with a will, for Annie was a general favorite, but some points of the programme Mr. Warren had sketched out, were unful filled. The young couple did not go to Switzerland or Italy, but spent the honeymoon in London."], [64, "56 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Mrs. Warren cried a good deal, but without being apparently much the worse for it, and Annie cried, too, herself, at leaving her old home. She knew little of the trouble and care it had been to her father to keep that home, nor how long it might .be before he must part with it. She had been happy there, and left it now with regret. She looked back at the snowy blind of her own room, with keen memories of the happy hours she had spent there. It was a fanciful idea, but it almost seemed as though the huge old poplars waved her a parting benediction ; there was such an air of almost human sympathy in the aspect of everything surrounding her old home. Mrs. Higgins had flung the old shoe after them, when they left the farm, and hoped it would be \"for a wise"], [65, "57 LETTER WRITING. purpose,\" though still having her doubts whether marriage was not a system calculated to place undue power in the hands of irrational and discontented creatures, for such she always considered men to be. But if Mrs. Higgins was. not quite clear as to the merits of matrimony as an institution, she was not the less interested in the event, for she was tenderly \u2014 so far, at least, as she under stood tenderness \u2014 attached to Annie. Sitting, about a week after their departure, at tea with Cruppy, who had been excessively cast down by the loss of his pretty young mistress, she sud denly startled him by clearing off the teacups and saucers, with extreme rapidity. \" What's amiss, Mrs. Higgins ?\" Cruppy asked."], [66, "58 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" Get me the pen and ink.\" Cruppy did so. \" Now some writing paper.\" Cruppy procured that also. \"Now be quiet, and let me think a bit.\" Singular ideas passed through Cruppy's mind, as he watched the rigid old lady, sitting there in a brown study, biting the end of her pen with terrible fierce ness, and frowning to a degree which almost alarmed him. Could it be pos sible, he thought, that the marriage had awakened some latent idea of love and matrimony, which had lain dormant for half a century in the heart of this austere maiden. Was she about to pen a love letter to some long neglected swain \u2014 if so, how devoutly Cruppy pitied him. Meanwhile, he continued gazing at her with the liveliest curiosity."], [67, "59 LETTER WRITING. The paper was before her \u2014 her arms were spread out upon the table, but she could not summon resolution to begin.

Her stirring up the ink had not improved its fluency, and the first movement of the pen caused a catastrophe. She tore up another sheet, and began again in earnest, so earnestly, indeed, that the effort to keep the pen steady, and make the lines run straight, made her perspire as though she had been hard at work. \" Cuss them aitches.\" This muttered exclamation had refer ence to the difficulty she found in writing the initial of Harland. Cruppy looked over, and the size and splendour of the letter H elicited his warmest admiration. \" Writing is a wonderful accomplishment, it's like making a pen talk,\" said he. \" Don't interrupt me.\" But Cruppy could not help it. He"], [70, "62 MARTYRS TO FASHION. shuffled with his feet, he coughed, he leaned upon the table. At last, losing all patience, Mrs. Higgins got up solemnly from her chair, caught the fidgetty Cruppy by the collar, pushed him into the wash house, and shut the door upon him. She seemed to think no more of this achievement than an ordinary person would of boxing the ears of a refractory child, and Cruppy accepted his punishment in the same spirit. However, after a time, Mrs. Higgins found her ideas coming so slowly, that she determined to admit him again. \" Come in, and be quiet if you can.\" Cruppy took his place again at table with the utmost good humour, increased, if possible, when Mrs. Higgins, as a peace-offering, gave him the key of the cellar to draw himself a mug of ale,"], [71, "LETTER WRITING. 63 for Cruppy could drink a jug of ale at any season. \" Tell her everything that's happened,\" Cruppy suggested.

Almost every line was obliterated by the sombre flood. Cruppy looked astounded, and fearing the dame's aspect, beat a hasty retreat, and gave no further assistance. He had a sensitive remembrance of other occasions when he had aroused the irrit- able old lady's wrath, for she was not particular in her choice of weapons \u2014 a broom or rolling pin \u2014 a dish clout or scrubbing brush, served her purpose equally well, and as he knew by stern VOL III.

There had already been so many mishaps over the letter, that she determined to finish it out of hand, come what would. At length, when poor Mrs. Warren, who had relapsed almost into imbecility since Annie's departure, had found relief from her alarm in a copious flood of tears, and Michael Warren, who stood upon his dignity more than ever, threatened to break the door open if she did not answer, Mrs. Higgins appeared radiant.

The consequence was, that a sudden jolt upon a stone threw him off his insecure seat, and down he went. The hill was very steep, and the pony was trotting pretty fast.

But onward, still onward they went, past the marsh, the lane, the wood, till the river came in sight, and glittered in the starlight, beneath Merton bridge, and died away in gentle murmurs, amid the tranquil meadows. A sullen boom, from the belfry of Merton, startled Cruppy. \" Nine o'clock,\" he whispered to him self. \"What old Warren will say to this caper, the Lord knows.\" Now they came in sight of Coombe, and it was, indeed, Coombe House that was on fire.

To add to Santi's perplexity, he now saw Laura, at the end of a long passage, leading to one of the bed chambers, eagerly imploring assistance, to get her aunt out of the house.

Santi heard him, and the ladder was planted against the wall. Nothing would induce Laura to move till her aunt was got out, and this was a task which was not easy of accom plishment. The poor lady was so help less, that it occupied, at least, a quarter an hour to get her to the ladder, and then she was obliged to be carried down.

There was a high wind, too, and by the time the fire engines came from Oxford and Wallingford, the house was a complete wreck. In this dilemma, Cruppy showed considerable tact and judgment. \" Most likely, ma'am, you know the Mount Farm,\" he said to Laura. \" Oh yes, the pretty house with those large poplars in front.\" \"That's it,\" Cruppy said. \"I've got master's pony and trap here, and this gentleman was riding with me when we saw the fire.

It was also a convenient plan for escaping the scolding which otherwise awaited him, for the rough treatment of his master's favorite pony. He went home gaily in conse quence. As he imagined, Mr. Warren was delighted with the prospect of enter taining these stylish neighbours, and startled even Mrs. Higgins by the numerous orders he gave for their comfort.

A light was burning in Annie's room, now appropriated by Laura, which was put out at this moment, and the stranger turned away, and walked slowly down the lane. \"I must know what that means,\" thought the farmer, and followed the man instantly. It was Santi. \" Good night, my friend,\" said the Italian, and hurried on. It was part of Cruppy's duty to look round the barns, stables, and outhouses at night, and see that all was safe.

In introducing his brother as director of \"The Colonial Produce Company,\" George Harland little imagined what the result of that step would be. We have before alluded to the marked difference in the characters of the brothers. With men of Gilbert's stamp, any decided and important event in their lives, tends to strengthen and develope their particular individuality. Thus, it will occasion no surprise, to learn that Gilbert, after having spent the honeymoon, and settled down in a suburban villa, after the fashion of city men generally, devoted himself to the"], [142, "134 MARTYRS TO FASHION. business of the company, with the deci sion, firmness, and clearness of vision, that distinguished all his doings. \"If I am to be a director of a com pany, and receive a thousand a year in return for my services and capital,\" argued Gilbert, \"by all means let me earn it, and do myself justice, and the company also.\" And in doing his work, whatever it was, there was an air of authority, which greatly impressed all who came in contact with Gilbert. Men felt at once that he was not to be trifled with ; that evasion and chicanery would be quickly seen through ; that he would not be satisfied . with glossing over a diffi culty, or, as city men call it, \" making things pleasant\" \u2014 a suggestive phrase that, when it stands for broken hearts, ruined homes, and dishonored names,"], [143, "135 OFF THE RAILS. as alas ! it has often done during the past year or two. In a calmer mood, it is unlikely that Gilbert would have taken so decided a step as to sell the timber yard, and cut off the chances of retreat, in case of failure, so completely as he had done ; but for Annie's sake, he would have thought no risk too great, and the greater the sacrifice demanded of him, consistent with honor and justice, the stronger he imagined would be his influence. George was in every respect the opposite of his brother. He was calmer in his manners, softer in his tones, milder in his looks, and slower in his perceptions than Gilbert. Knowing how frequently George had been deceived in his dealings at Merton, and how often he had confided in people who took"], [144, "136 MARTYRS TO FASHION. advantage of his genial nature, Gilbert would have hesitated before embarking in business with him, upon a larger scale, had not the proposition been backed up by his uncle. He knew that Shirley and Son had been for years a firm of considerable magnitude, and judging by the style in which they lived, he concluded that the business must be profitable and sound. When, however, he joined the com pany, and saw the lavish expenditure on all hands, the increased staff, the enormous rent paid for the new premises in Cannon Street, which were in reality not much larger than the old warehouse in St. Mary Axe, and yet cost more than double the rent ; when he enquired closely into the terms of credit, also the rates of profit, the salaries and"], [145, "137 OFF THE RAILS. commissions paid to travellers and agents, the advertising and high remuneration of the directors, his plain common sense told him, that to make such an enter prise really successful, would not be one of the easiest tasks ; and he immediately entered into a series of elaborate cal culations, based upon such statistics as he could obtain, during the short time he had been connected with the company, and the result of his deliberation was, that the \" Colonial Produce Company \" would not, could not, and did not pay. More than this, the inexorable logic of figures, convinced him that the business could not have paid for some time past. There were curious items in the books, as handed over to the company, which had been passed without comment by Lord Dufferly and others like him, who only sought a profit from"], [146, "138 MARTYRS TO FASHION. the use of their names, but Gilbert's case was different from theirs. The stake he had in the company was vital to him. It either meant one of two things, ease and affluence, or absolute ruin. He had been quick to detect the rottenness of the company, and took measures then and there, to bring matters to a climax. George was sipping his coffee in his Islington apartments, and skimming the contents of the Times, when he received an unexpected call from Gilbert. \"You're an early visitor,\" George said, \"but I am very glad to see you, old fellow. You've not breakfasted yet, I suppose.\" \" Some time ago,\" Gilbert replied. \" In fact, George, I have not slept over well, and I was glad to get up early.\" \"Nothing the matter, I hope.\""], [147, "OFF THE RAILS. 139 \" There is this the matter, George. We stand a very good chance of being ruined.\" \"Good heaven, what do you mean,\" exclaimed George, as he dropped the Times, and half rose from his chair with excitement, seeing the grave expression of Gilbert's face. \" The simple fact is, George, that this infernal ' Colonial Produce Company,' is very little better than a swindle.\" \"And I have tempted you into it, thinking that it would hasten your happiness, and enable you to live in a style that would be more agreeable to Annie. What an unmitigated ass I have been, but is it really, really so ? Have you proved it is ?\" The poor fellow could say no more, but, wringing Gilbert's hands, burst into tears."], [148, "140 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" There, there, my good fellow,\" said Gilbert, half tenderly, half impatiently, \" don't take that to heart ; we are in an awful mess, and we must get out of it the best way we can; you must stand by me hard and fast, but for a day or two say nothing, and do not in any way show that you have any suspicions.\" \" What then do you propose ?\" \"I cannot yet explain my entire plan, but I will sift the whole thing to the bottom before I speak a word. When I do act, it will be in a way that shall be final.\" George recovered his spirits almost immediately, under the influence of his brother's firmer temperament, and his curiosity was awakened to know what discovery Gilbert could have made in so short a time."], [149, "141 OFF THE RAILS. \u25a0\" Everything seemed going on swim mingly, as far as I could judge,\" George said, cheerfully. \" Aye, and they would go on swim mingly for a year or two, perhaps, and we should receive our salaries, and a handsome dividend upon our shares, and no end of people will be crying up the company, and making a picking out of it, and by and by the bubble bursts, and we are penniless.\" \"What has tended to make you suspicious ?\" asked George. \" The large quantities of goods supplied within a short space of time, to four or five firms of doubtful reputation,\" Gilbert answered, \" you will be able to see through it yourself, when I mention the names.\" \"Ah, I know the parties you are alluding to, George said, \" and I imagine"], [150, "142 MARTYRS TO FASHION. what you are intending to do ; you mean to enquire carefully into their affairs.\" \" I do, and at once ; let us say no more till I am satisfied.\" He shook hands with George, and they parted. Gilbert started for the city, but did not at once go to the offices of the company. In pursuance of his plan, he called first upon a clever accountant, in Moorgate Street, and then proceeded to Walbrook. It is well known that any merchant or tradesman subscribing to the establish ment of Messrs. Parry and Wynne, of Walbrook, may obtain always in a day or two, generally in an hour or two, sufficient details as to the credit and stability, the capital and resources of any city firm of a year's standing, to enable him to judge in some degree the"], [151, "OFF THE RAILS. 143 amount of risk he will incur, in giving such a firm credit. Gilbert had ascertained that, and many other items of useful knowledge, applicable to city trading, before he had been many days connected with the company. He knew, therefore, that there was not the slighest reason for incurring unnecessary risk. He had sent in a list of names two days before. Names of firms and export agents, with whom \" The Colonial Produce Company\" was trading largely, and he now awaited, at the office in Walbrook, the report which Messrs. Parry and Wynne promised him. \" You are quite certain,\" Gilbert, said to the clerk who attended to him, \" that the particulars you are now giving me, can be relied upon.\" \"Quite so,\" the clerk answered."], [152, "144 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \"Messrs.

Shirley and Son, will doubtless, to avoid exposure, consent to the arrangement, and we may get out of the affair without much loss.\" \" Don't be too sanguine. It will be a work of time ; after it is carried through the court, and liquidators appointed, and the assets realized, a considerable hole will be made in the capital.\" \" The board assembled on the following day. George felt extremely nervous as he took his place with his brother directors, but Gilbert was as firm as a rock, and his purpose was unalterable."], [157, "149 OFF THE RAILS. He remembered his mother's tears and bitter regrets at the sale of the timber yard, which had been in his family for more than a century. He pictured his own humiliation, and the shock it would be to Annie when she discovered all her roseate dreams annihilated, and she would be compelled, perhaps, to sink down to a lower position than that she would have occupied originally. He cursed the pride and weakness which had led him to sacrifice the interests of others in this blind way. Even for Michael Warren, he had a feeling of pity, knowing, as he did, how difficult it would be for the farmer to meet his liabilities, if pressed. His indignation towards his uncle and cousin, knew no bounds. He had been all his life accustomed to conduct business matters with the most rigid integrity."], [158, "150 MARTYRS TO FASHION. When he sold a pile of timber, there were the number of feet and inches, the exact size, and quality, which could be as readily ascertained by the customer as himself. There was no shifting or shuffling. His ideas of right and justice had not been blunted by con stantly mixing with men of doubtful principles, holding positions to which they were not entitled, either by capital, talent, or honorable labor. When, therefore, Gilbert calmly, but firmly made a statement to his brother directors, praying them at once to wind up \"The Colonial Produce Company,\" and showing by unanswerable facts, that the company was not, and never had been, solvent, the accusation fell upon them like a thunderbolt. The particulars of the company's affairs had been, in a great measure,"], [159, "151 OFF THE RAILS. taken for granted. The directors, with the exception of Mr. Shirley and Gilbert Harland, were not men of business, and the reality of their position struck them dumb. Lord Dufferly was the first to speak. \" We are greatly indebted to Mr. Harland,\" said he, \"for the enquiries and calculations he has been good enough to make. In lending my name, which, I am proud to say, is for the first time associated with transactions of a doubtful character, I was misled by false representations. I shall certainly second the proposition made by Mr. Harland, that this company be volun tarily wound up. Possibly, the severe pressure we experienced last year in financial matters, may, however, be some excuse for Mr. Shirley, senior.\" \"You are over hasty, Gilbert,\" said"], [160, "152 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Mr. Shirley, nervously, and like a drowning man, catching at a straw. \" Messrs. Tightfit and Bland w7ill dis count paper to any amount, upon the houses you have named.\" \" Remember,\" said Lord Dufferly, \"the company, not the bankers, will have to provide for those bills, if they are worthless.\" \" I think we have heard quite enough,\" said another director, a man of unstained honor, \"to warrant a dissolution of the company. Mr. Harland' s statement is so clear and concise, that no second course is open to us. We have to thank him for his manly conduct, and I sincerely trust he may not suffer seriously in consequence.\" \" It will give me the greatest pleasure to meet Mr. Harland at my table,\" said Lord Dufferly. \"His moral courage"], [161, "OFF THE RAILS. 153 will at least save us from disgrace, if not from disaster.\" The meeting ended, after a formal resolution being put, and carried, for winding up the company. Mr. Shirley and Walter passed Gilbert on their way out of the room, but neither of them spoke a word. As for Walter, he felt utterly crushed. The doors of that pleasant mansion in Gros venor Square, were closed upon him for ever, and Lord Dufferly's beautiful daughter he knew would never be his. Poverty might not have prevented the union, but the mistaken kindness of his father had ruined his prospects for ever. It seemed remorseless upon Gilbert's part, but there was no middle course. He pitied both his uncle and his cousin, but that did not alter the stern facts. The company had been got up and"], [162, "154 MARTYRS TO FASHION. conducted on a principle which must ensure greater loss every moment it was carried on. It would be some loss to all concerned, as it was, but delay would have sacrificed everything. Gilbert went home to his pretty little wife with a very heavy heart, which, however, he tried his utmost to conceal. He certainly felt more for her than for himself. He was strong and vigorous in frame, with unbounded energy and moral courage. To a man of his stamp, there was no such word as failure. If one channel was closed, he would find another, and that speedily, but the desires and dreams, which had already cost Annie many tears, and frequent disappointment, seemed likely to bring her real sorrow. Gilbert knew, already, that he would"], [163, "155 OFF THE RAILS. make a serious loss upon his shares, and he had been at much expense in furnishing their villa, and other indul gencies which might have been spared. He could see at present only one plan of action, which was to go back to Merton, and compromise the matter with Compton, as best he could. He believed that the paper maker would not drive a hard bargain with him, when he learned how unfortunate the city experiment had proved. Annie received her husband joyously. \" Oh, Gilbert dear,\" she said, as soon as he entered the door, \" there is such a charming ballad concert to-night, at St. James's Hall. Lemmens-Sherrington, Sainton Dolby, Sims Reeves, Arabella Goddard, and I don't know how many more. Do take me, will you ?\" Could he tell her at once that he was"], [164, "156 MARTYRS TO FASniON. nearly ruined, and, perhaps, her father also? There was much sympathy for George and Gilbert, when the affairs of the company came to be investigated. The item of three thousand pounds, advanced by George, of course appeared upon the books, and was regarded by the directors as a discreditable operation on the part of Mr. Shirley. Men become astonishingly virtuous, and show the greatest hatred of any deceptive or underhand dealing, when they cannot possibly derive any benefit from it. If, by the advance, a success ful company had been established, the thing would have had quite another aspect. Mr. Shirley would have been looked upon as a model financier. The affair got wind, and was wafted abroad over the city, like many other"], [165, "OFF THE RAILS. 157 ill winds, which do nobody good, but which seem always blowing hardest when times are pressing. Men said in an undertone, at street corners \u2014 \" I say, what do you think of old Shirley, swindling his nephew out of three thousand pounds.\" \"You don't say so, how is that?\" Then comes an explanation, and like other tales, that of the \" Colonial Produce Company \" loses nothing by carrying, so that the shares fall to zero, and nobody will look at them. Then follows ridicule, that potent element of destruction, and finishes what mismanagement began, and in a day or two Shirley and Son are in common parlance, \" off the rails.\""], [166, "CHAPTER XL BADEN-BADEN.

He may shoot or hang himself, or quit the country.

The position in which he was now placed, and his mother's determined hold upon her purse-strings made him desperate. Within an hour or two from Caroline's departure, he wras on his way to Baden, determined to venture all his remaining cash for the chance of once more break ing the bank.

He supposed Caroline would stay at least a week or so in the country. She would visit Laura Mostyn he knew, but he could not read Caroline's thoughts in that matter. Conscious that she had been the means of undermining whatever attachment he felt for Laura, she had an uneasy conscience in accepting her hospitality.

Having decided against visiting Merton till the autumn, a feeling of peace and security crept over Hugh's mind, to which it had been a stranger for the last two years.

As to his young wife, intoxicated with the loving worship of the hand some young Englishman, she gave herself up with all the glow and impetuosity of her southern nature, to the joys of youth and love.

Hugh had never seen the man before, but when their eyes met, he was fas cinated by the intense gaze of the singer, and could no more avoid them than if some strange magnetic influence had been exercised upon him. Schondorf had a different feeling. This was the man he had been seeking for months. He knew him by the extreme likeness to the portrait he"], [183, "SCHONDORF'S CONCERT. 175 carried about with him. Schondorf was on the point of starting upon this engagement, when Santi's message came to town, and thus was prevented from following the clue given to him. But now he was determined that Hugh should not escape him, and the stern earnestness of his purpose gave to his tones a depth and power, such as had never been heard in La Scala before. He was not merely singing the music of the demon huntsman, he seemed himself, for the moment, like an avenging fiend. The thunder of his deep notes vibrated through the theatre, till Hugh felt his very blood chilled by them. Such sing ing as this was unaccountable ; its weird power filled him with awe, and the singer's gaze never left him an instant, but seemed to penetrate his very soul."], [184, "176 MARTYRS TO FASHION. When it was concluded, there was a furore that shook the very walls of the house. Applause was not the name for it. It was the very madness of enthusiasm. They shouted, they encored, they stamped, they roared like savages, shed tears in their intense delight ; and when the tumult, which occasioned some perturbation, as it was supposed by the police to have a political meaning, had subsided, Schondorf sang the latter por tion of the scena again, with equal effect. But his eyes looked into those of Hugh keen, stern, and enquiringly, even while he bowed his acknowledgments of the whirlwind of applause ; and the look became so painful to Hugh, that he proposed to withdraw as soon as it was over. \" You are unwell, dearest, I know you are,\" said his bride, \"I have seen you"], [185, "SCHONDORF'S CONCERT. 177 look pale all the time that strange man was singing.\" \" Merely the heat and excitement, my love,\" answered Hugh; we are not accustomed, in our cooler climate, to welcome a public performer with so much warmth. And there is something in this man, I cannot explain what, that has a singular effect upon me. If I were superstitious, I should imagine that he had some mysterious power over me : some influence upon my future life and destiny, which I am unable to account for, and unable to control.\" Yielding to the suggestion, they left the theatre, and as their hotel was but a short distance, Hugh proposed they should pass the celebrated cathedral, while the moonlight was upon it.

Charles, darling, what is it, tell me what is the matter,\" cried the lady, for Hugh seemed paralyzed; at length, he said to Schondorf \u2014 \"Come with me to the nearest cafe'"], [187, "SCHONDORF'S CONCERT. 179 and do you, dearest, go back to the hotel. I have a few words to say to this gentleman.\" A vehicle was passing, and Hugh, placing his young wife in it, and telling her not to be alarmed, turned with Schondorf into a cafe. \" Your behaviour is so strange,\" said Hugh, when thev w7ere alone, that I must request an immediate explanation. The words you made use of, refer to an event which has deeply moved me.\" \"Your brother,\" said Schondorf, \" with out wasting words, was the real Sir Charles Sinclair, and now, Hugh Sinclair, the time has come for you to make restitution.

He seemed utterly unable to defend his conduct, or to evade its consequences. \"Justice shall be done,\" said he, faintly, \" come what will.\" \"Some men would not believe your penitence,\" said Schondorf, \"but I under stand men well, and I perceive you will keep your word ; and now, say when and where, in the presence of witnesses, and sealed with legal powers, this claim shall be established.\" \" To-morrow at twelve, at my hotel ;\" and he gave Schondorf the address.

The Mostyns, however, still remained at the Mount Farm, and Laura was well pleased with the life they led.

Old Lady Mostyn, having been much shaken by the late misfortune, induced Santi to give Laura some advice as to her treatment. She derived so much benefit from his skill, that to pacify her, Santi consented to call every day. He felt, at the same time, that he was placing himself in a false position, but the temptation to be near Laura was irresistible. Laura, on her part, felt herself drawn more and more to the physician every hour. The evident truthfulness of his character, the under current of passion and sentiment that was revealed in his looks and tones, his"], [192, "184 MARTYRS TO FASHION. gentle easy manners and refinement of taste, and not less his good looks, for the Italian was a very handsome man, all attracted Laura. There was a certain mystery clinging to his position, which was also not without its charm. He seemed a man who had mixed in good society, but was either without property, or had met with misfortunes. There was that in Santi's manner, earnestly as he tried to conceal it, which quickly betrayed his inward feeling to Laura, and she was too completely a woman not to feel a little triumph in the subjugation of this handsome man. There was a satisfaction, too, in feeling that it was her personal attraction alone which fascinated him. She was quite sure that he was not a fortune-hunter, that he was captivated with her qualities as a woman, rather than influenced by"], [193, "laura's decision. 185 any advantages of her position. She believed, too, that the sudden coldness and reserve, which he sometimes as sumed, was the result of high-minded conduct, and was certain, that without encouragement, he would quit her society eventually, without one word to indicate his secret aspirations. Laura had no adviser, her aunt was old, helpless, and almost childish, her fortune was entirely at her own disposal, and if she loved the man, it was but for her to give him sufficient encourage ment, and none could gainsay her. But Laura had her own pride to combat; she had already been wounded by the conduct of Captain Mellor, and sometimes imagined that she had brought a certain amount of humiliation upon herself, through her freedom and thought lessness. Not that the defection of the"], [194, "186 MARTYRS TO FASniON. Captain had occasioned her more than a passing regret, though she grieved sincerely over the probable disappoint ment and unhappiness of Caroline. It was natural that Laura, being so warm-hearted and impulsive, and ready to respond instantly to any show of affection, should be, for the moment, deceived in the man. But there is always one safeguard in spontaneous feeling, it has a tendency to draw out the character and temper of the person upon whom it is bestowed. This had been so, especially with regard to Mellor, and the early discovery which Laura had made of his true character, led to the satirical and half-bitter remarks we have chronicled in a former chapter. A woman like Laura, having once been induced to wear her heart upon her sleeve, would not so heedlessly"], [195, "LAURA' S DECISION. 187 imperil it in future. But the slight imaginary loss of self-respect, which had pained her for the moment, had not in any way altered her manners or disposition. A coarser and more selfish kind of temper might have been soured by such a slight as she had received. Not so Laura. She saw plainly that any feeling the Captain may have had for her, was too shallow to be permanent ; there was not warmth or glow enough in it to have kept her own alive for any length of time. The little insight into character she had gained, had not been without its use, for she felt that the hour or two spent at the death-bed of poor Sandall, had revealed to her a man of genuine and noble nature. She pictured to herself the demeanour of a man like Mellor at the death-bed of the poor"], [196, "188 MARTYRS TO FASHION. disappointed artist. What sympathy, what delicacy would he have shown ? None whatever \u2014 probably he would have invented some paltry excuse to leave the cottage. The great mystery of death, which in a moment levels our childish distinctions of rank and cir cumstance, had little meaning for such a man ; but there had been a solemn dignity, a reverential tone in the behaviour of Santi, which made Laura feel from that moment, that it would be possible to love such a man deeply, and with an affection that would strengthen with time. Several times the Italian came and went, during his attendance upon Lady Mostyn, without seeing Laura. Mrs. Warren, or even Mrs. Higgins, accom panied him to the old lady's apartment, and to Laura's enquiry if Santi had"], [197, "LAURA'S DECISION. 189 made any suggestion, or had requested to speak to her in reference to her aunt, the answer had simply been that Santi had reported favorably of her ladyship, and nothing more. Meagre nourishment this for love to feed upon, but there are times when love does not stand in need of rich stimulants, or piquant dainties for its support and growth. Just such a time was this, when Laura saw the physician come and go, and yet did not even appear personally to enquire as to her aunt's recovery. One day, however, a message came to Laura's bedroom \u2014 she took refuge there about the time Santi was likely to call \u2014 a message that sent the blood rushing to her lovely cheeks, partly from fear, partly from hope, partly from pride. This message was brought by Mrs."], [198, "190 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Higgins, and was to the effect that Santi would be glad to speak with her. Laura recovered herself in a moment, and replied \u2014 \" I will come down to him. I hope my aunt is not worse.\" \" Oh dear no, miss,\" said Mrs. Higgins, \" she walked a bit in the garden, just now, leaning on that gentleman's arm.\" Laura knew that perfectly well, but ladies in love must say something. She went, as if by instinct, into the garden, and a very pretty garden it was at the Mount Farm, and there she found Santi. He bowed low, but he could not con ceal his agitation, and his sweet tenor voice was a little tremulous when he spoke. \" I have been to-day to Coombe,\" he said, \"and find that a large portion of"], [199, "laura's decision. 191 the house is ready for habitation. I thought, under the circumstances, you would be glad to know, that there will be no danger in removing Lady Mostyn.\" \" I am very glad, indeed, to hear that,\" Laura answered, \" as she will, doubtless, be pleased to get back to Coombe, but for myself, I have enjoyed these few days spent at the farm, amazingly, and shall exchange, with regret, the cheerfulness of the Mount Farm, for the dulness of Coombe.\" \"It is hard to believe in dulness, where Miss Mostyn is present,\" said Santi. It was the first compliment he had paid her. \"It is very kind of you to say so,\" Laura replied, \" but woman's world in England is a restricted one.

I must go back in a few days to Italy.\" \" Indeed ! I am very sorry to hear that.\" \" I am but a poor man, Miss Mostyn, dependent upon my profession for bread.

I shall make the most of the little pro perty I have in Rome, and settle in one of the cities on the coast, perhaps Leghorn, or Genoa, and you will forget that such a poor fellow as Santi ever lived.\" \"Never!\" answered Laura, \"I shall always remember that I have been associated, under singular circumstances, with a true gentleman, who has made me forget that there are such things as country, climate, or language, where real vol in. o"], [202, "194 MARTYRS TO FASHION. manhood is concerned. If I am likely to be forgetful at all, the risk is of forgetting myself.\" The warm-hearted creature shed tears, and could say no more. \"Oh, madame,\" said Santi, \"if you speak like that, and look like that, I shall indeed forget myself also, and, p3rhaps, forfeit your good opinion for ever. Yet, if I dared to say\" \u2014 He waited, but Laura did not speak a word. \" If I dared to say,\" he repeated, that I loved you, as well as ever man loved woman in this world \u2014 that it is madness and annihilation to quit this land, and carry with me but a memory of your tender heart and noble form \u2014 if I dared to say, that I shall never again, in all my life, see a woman to equal you \u2014 if I, poor, unfriended, and"], [203, "laura's decision. 195 lonely, dared to say this to a woman who is rich, who is beautiful, who has placed confidence in me, and who now speaks with so much kindness and feeling, would she not think me an idiot ?\" \"No, indeed,\" said Laura, \"she would think that you meant every word you say. She would think everything pure minded and honorable : she would forget the paltry differences of wealth, the artificial distinctions of rank ; and be thankful that such barriers as these could so easily be overthrown.\" \" What can I do to prove my devo tion ?\" exclaimed Santi. \"Only be for the remainder of your life, the good, kind, manly fellow I have known during the past few weeks, and I shall be abundantly contented.\" \" And your friends ?\" \" Will laugh at me a little, I dare o 2"], [204, "196 MARTYRS TO FASHION. say, but I hope to prove that I am the best judge of my own happiness.\" If Mr. Warren had been already mys tified by the conduct of Santi, he was staggered entirely, when, coming home from Wallingford market, he overtook the happy pair in the lane, Laura leaning upon the Italian's arm, and both so engrossed with each other, that they did not perceive him. \"There really is no understanding these foreigners,\" was his puzzled com ment."], [205, "CHAPTER XIV. WINDING UP. Before Annie had learned what a heavy blow had fallen upon all concerned in the \" Colonial Produce Company,\" her confidence in London life had been somewhat shaken. She had indulged in some extravagant dreams as to the extent of her visiting list, the cultivated acquaintances she would make, the general refinement and lofty tone of London society. Those who are really familiar with that society will readily understand that the fashionable world for which Annie sighed, was very far removed from her. The circle in which her husband"], [206, "198 MARTYRS TO FASHION. moved, consisted of men who had slaved at the drudgery of the desk and the counter, till their whole natures were colored and toned by their daily occupa tions. What intellectual pursuit is a man likely to follow, who has been from nine till six in a dingy warehouse, or muddling his brains with columns of figures ? who has had an indigestible dinner, hastily swallowed in the middle of the day, while grudging every moment he spared from his engrossing occupations ; or, perhaps, with no dinner till he reaches home, when fatigue, and the process of digestion, quite incapacitate him from any thought deeper than that required by a lively novel, and even then, he generally goes to sleep over the second chapter \u2014 what can be expected in the way of intellectual resource from such men ?"], [207, "199 WINDING UP. That was one class of business men. Then, sometimes, would come specimens of another sort.

Men who had leisure time enough, perhaps, to have become painters, poets, or what not. But did they ? On the contrary, when men of this stamp visited her husband, they fell to discussing speculative schemes, and rail way shares ; they suggested ideas for new companies, or keenly criticised the management of those already existing ; their only topics of the day were the rise and fall of the rate of discount, and the price of consols ; their prime amusement the dissection of some gigan tic swindle ; and their chief anecdotes"], [208, "200 MARTYRS TO FASHION. were of strange expedients to raise the w7ind. If Annie sang, they chattered an accompaniment. If she spoke of artists or musicians, she found the names of the greatest and best in the world of art, were less familiar to them than the name of any sharp lawyer, who had successfully carried some broken-winded scheme through Parliament. If these men constituted society, she preferred to be alone. Once or twice Lord Dufferly had called, to consult Gilbert respecting the company, but his stay had been short, and Annie, who scarcely saw his lordship, felt that, during the brief interview, her husband had merely received the deference due to a good man of business. Lord Dufferly had evidently no greater interest in Gilbert than in a machine, that was doing its proper work regularly."], [209, "WINDING UP. 201 Then the ladies ! Well, Annie, when at Merton, certainly enjoyed a little cultivated society. The paper maker's daughters were, at least, well educated, and sang and played with considerable skill. There were no attractions to tempt them away from home, and they were glad for Annie to join them in the evening, and bring her music or fancy work ; and if Mr. Chekker, who was supposed to have his eye upon the eldest Miss Compton, dropped in later in the evening, they got up a glee or part-song, applauded each other much, and were quite happy. Or, they took part in the Penny Readings, and Annie would sing a little ballad, so feelingly, that the simple country folks might be seen with tears in their eyes, and talked of it miles away, and sometimes, she would be"], [210, "202 MARTYRS TO FASHION. invited to a dance or amateur concert at the houses of the neighbouring gentry. All this, was at least, friendly and sociable, and while Annie remembered many pleasant little gatherings at Merton, she was bitterly disappointed to find that in London she had not even that gratification. For the wives of the men her husband now associated with, were either women who had helped their husbands in grub bing up the money they possessed, or else wrere the daughters of men who had w7orked their way from a very humble position, and who were so extremely anxious to forget the sordid foundations of their fortunes, that they only culti vated society in a higher grade than their own, and suffered martyrdom in various ways to effect an entrance into the world of fashion."], [211, "203 WINDING UP.

Gilbert saw all this, and was grieved at the evident disappointment of his pretty young wife. To compensate for the absence of that society for which she pined, he took her constantly to places of amusement, but the effect was not satisfactory ; such novelty as could be had soon wore off. One gets tired of seeing the same drama more than three times, and the opera is expensive, and not always in season. Besides, Gilbert was often not in the best disposition for evening amusements, after his day"], [212, "204 MARTYRS TO FASHION. in the city, and sundry little tiffs, too trivial to grieve him, but important enough to cause him a passing vexation, had taken place. The rigidity of London life had at least one good result, it broke, in some degree, the despair which Annie felt, when the failure of the company became known to her. But when Gilbert gently and tenderly explained to her the full extent of the disaster, he thought she would have sunk under it. Feeling it incumbent upon him to realize every shilling, he sold off all the pretty furniture of the villa so lately furnished in exact accordance with Annie's tastes. He applied himself to the task of winding up the company, with the same diligence and systematic care he would have exercised if the affair had been flourishing."], [213, "WINDING UP. 205 One of his brother directors twitted him with his anxiety about some obscure item in the accounts, but Gilbert retorted sharply \u2014 \"It is the least we can do, after playing with the money of others, to give them some explanation where, and how it is gone.\" The same principle influenced him in his private arrangements. His heart sank within him, when he saw Annie's tears, as item after item of elegant furniture, selected with the greatest taste, was handed up for the inspection of dirty brokers and Jews, and knocked down to them at half the original cost, but Gilbert would have paid to the uttermost, if he had gone back to Merton on foot. At length his task was ended, and he enquired if George would join him once"], [214, "206 MARTYRS TO FASHION. more in re-establishing the business of the timber yard. But George had not the moral courage to face Merton gossip just yet. Gilbert urged him, and spoke earnestly as to his own feelings. \" You know, George, we have done nothing to be really ashamed of. We have been deceived, and so have thousands in these foolish schemes, but we have paid the penalty of our pride, and there is no better way, I think, to gain the respect of our old friends and neighbours, than by resolutely setting to work to retrieve our losses.

NINE DAYS' WONDER. TnERE were few men who would accept the inevitable, with a better grace than Gilbert. Satisfied that his wisest course was to go back to the quiet country life at Merton, he set himself with the utmost energy to carry out the plan. Compton, as he imagined, being wealthy, and not without some gene rosity, notwithstanding his cynical man ners, made the arrangements for the re-purchase of the timber yard as easy as he could, and in a few weeks after the break-up of the company, it seemed as though no change had taken place in his outward life."], [217, "NINE DAYS' WONDER'. 209 But inwardly he had a hard struggle to contend with. His young wife seemed apathetic and indifferent to everything at first, and it had only been by unceasing effort, and unweary ing kindness and patience, that Gilbert had brought her to a more resigned and christian state of feeling. It seemed to him, that if Annie would only fall into her old ways, associate with her old friends, and in every way endeavour to live her former life again, that she must eventually become happier. One of his first steps, was to induce her to sing again in the old church. She had still an intense love of music, though in London she sang very little, and Gilbert felt he had achieved a master stroke, when Mr. Chekker paid them a visit, at his suggestion, and urged upon Annie again to take her place in the choir.

Old associations came back to them in the familiar notes, old jealousies and petty aversions, seemed to become dimmer, and under this simple spell, these human beings, who so little understood themselves, felt in some strange, undefined way, that life for the moment, at least, was larger, sweeter, and better than they had known it for a long time. And they were grateful, too, in their homely way, for the influence Annie had exercised upon them, and before she could escape from the church, there was a crowd of honest genial faces in the porch, and so many kind invitations and good wishes, that she went home with tears in her eyes, and Gilbert felt that his patience and earnestness were really bearing good fruit after all. p 2"], [220, "212 MARTYRS TO FASHION.

Then the sweet spring-time was advancing rapidly, and there was no smoke to darken the soft blue of the sky, no harsh sounds to deaden the happy notes of the birds, no gloomy, narrow streets to shut out the distant landscape. The change from the murky gloom of the winter in London, seemed to reveal a glory, joy, and peace in the sweet fields and the rippling river, she had never received from them before.

The failure of the company caused heavy calls to be made upon the farmer, and it was with the greatest difficulty he could keep the farm. Fre quently sharp reminders would come of long standing debts, and he was obliged to put them off with lamentable excuses. Arthur, too, was making but a sorry figure at college. It was but too plain that he would never reflect any credit upon his friends. His life was purpose less, and his abilities were not sufficient to enable him to profit by study.

The widow Harland was less rigid than might have been expected, and was as genial as old age and disappoint ment can well be.

Laura was deeply affected by the fate of this handsome, proud, worldly man.

She determined to make a settlement upon Caroline, which would, at all events, relieve her from anxiety, and if she chose to take up her residence at Coombe, there was plenty of room for her in the large, old, rambling house. It was quite a relief to Laura, in the midst of her grief, to feel that she had some means, at least, of expending her hitherto superfluous tenderness and sym pathy. The future of single blessedness, with the society of lapdogs, parrots and tom-cats, which she had laughingly"], [235, "227 A CONTRAST. pictured to Caroline, was not likely to be her fate now. She never cared for accomplishments, or visiting : all she craved for, was to have a powerful interest created in her own home. It cheered her every moment in the day, to feel that Santi was an un worldly, unsophisticated man, free from any taint of the man-about-town. A man who would not require vulgar ex citements to keep him cheerful and good tempered. A man of cultivation, too, who would know how to appreciate any taste or refinement in her, and not be merely a coarse lover of dogs and horses, like the country squires of the neighbourhood. Laura was quite careless, even if she sank a little in public estimation through this alliance. She had enjoyed all the Q 2"], [236, "228 MARTYRS TO FASHION. luxuries of pleasure and wealth, but would have gladly sacrificed them, if such a course had been necessary, to secure the affection of such a man as he who had chosen her. She had lived all her life with her prim old aunt, having lost her parents when she was quite a child, and had grown up with a secret fund of passion, fire, and tenderness, which would have shocked the old lady, could she have imagined the thoughts that filled her lovely niece's brain.

English men would hardly have had as little reserve with each other, had they really been brothers. Such friendships are by no means uncommon on the continent, and Santi, in the joy of his heart, wrote to his old friend, without the slightest restraint. He described his first interview with Laura, and every little incident that had happened, up to the happy fruition of his hopes. Every little peculiarity, every little trick of manner, or uncon scious grace that Laura possessed, were lovingly dwelt upon by the enraptured Italian. \" Yes,\" he concluded, \" I loved Laura"], [238, "230 MARTYRS TO FASHION. from the moment in which her eyes first met mine, by the death-bed of a poor, but clever artist, whose declining days had been soothed by her tenderness and generosity. \" Do not imagine, Schondorf, that her beauty alone is the sole foundation of my love.

Annie saw, with intense grief, that her father was growing daily paler, and more haggard. His eyes were dull, his looks vacant and desponding. It was evident, that he was at his wit's end as to the future. At other times, he was the victim of a feverish agitation; his words, looks, and manner, showed impatience and excitement, and he would suddenly leave the farm, and go into Oxford, almost daily, without speaking a word to any body as to his business. Sometimes, at night, Mrs. Warren"], [242, "234 MARTVRS TO FASHION. would wake with alarm, to hear her husband walking about the room, and muttering to himself. She was too timid to show him that she had seen his anxiety, but sought Annie's advice at once. But even Annie failed to soothe his excitement and nervousness. He hardly noticed her gentle sympathy, and when she pressed him for the cause of his sorrow, he was silent, or left her altogether. The fact was, poor Warren was alarmed by the near approach of the time, when he must pay up the calls on behalf of the \" Colonial Produce Company.\" He was already deeply in debt, but a man who is known, may frequently hold out for years in the country, after he is absolutely insolvent.

It was agree able to send Annie and her mother shopping, and see them at church on Sunday, looking smarter and prettier than their neighbours ; but the linen draper wanted money. To make matters worse, Arthur had"], [244, "236 MARTYRS TO FASHION. been accepting bills, for the sake of raising money at college, at terrible rates of interest, and implored his father to meet them, and save him from disgrace. Bitterly as it pierced the farmer's pride, he felt there was but one man to whom he could appeal with any confidence, and that was Gilbert. He could not be blind to Gilbert's genuine, honest, and straightforward behaviour in a case of difficulty, but he winced at the idea of showing him in what con dition his affairs had been for years, after having lorded it over him as he had done. The farmer had always avoided looking closely into his affairs. The moment he did so, any time during the past ten years, he saw at once that he ought to retrench, and not permit the constant"], [245, "237 GOING TO THE DOGS. little indulgences, and unnecessary ex penses which were daily sapping the roots of his position.

Even the poor laborers had some arrears due to them. When Mr. Warren at length sum moned up courage to speak to Gilbert about it, he met with none of that latent sarcasm, which he had so much feared. On the contrary, Gilbert, though fully alive to his weak and self-indulgent nature, pitied him from his heart. He saw at once that the Mount Farm could be held no longer, unless the farmer chose to stand a seige. and ultimately submit to the inevitable crash that must soon come.

There were many points of sympathy between Mellor and Caroline. Both were, not to speak it harshly, adventurers.

One might imagine two butterflies, fluttering from flower to flower, during a sunshiny day, sipping the sweets prepared for them by the labor of others, as emblematical of such natures as Caroline and Mellor.

Laura saw with astonishment and intense sorrow, that Caroline pined aw7ay from the moment of learning Mellor's fate. She was never possessed of much physical strength, but her sprightliness and vivacity, gave an appearance of health and vigour, that did not really belong to her.

How earnestly she longed that the painter of that sweet landscape yet lived. It seemed to her, that she was now so utterly alone in the world, and with her father to comfort her, she could have borne her grief better. Not that anything could exceed the generous care of Laura Mostyn, but Caroline knew of her engagement to Santi, and of course felt that her own claim would be slight with such a woman, compared to that of a husband.

She was so weak that she would have fallen, had not Laura, who was as vigorous as she was tender-hearted, supported her, and almost carried her along. But, even in the few days since she had been at Coombe, Laura per ceived that she had become sensibly weaker, and it was quite with difficulty that she tottered to a garden chair, and sank into it, quite exhausted. \"There, I'm glad, dear, that you summoned up courage to come out,"], [254, "246 MARTYRS TO FASHION. aster all.

After a time she revived a little, and Laura watched the signs of returning anima tion with the greatest anxiety. \"Oh, how my head whirls,\" said Caroline, feebly, as she gradually re covered. \" Why have I come back again to life and unhappiness.\" \" The air, perhaps, is too keen for you, dear,\" and Laura, without calling"], [256, "248 MARTYRS TO FASHION. assistance, carried her back into the house, laid her upon a sofa, and sat beside her, while Caroline, too exhausted to speak, could only press her friend's hand gently, to thank her. Laura was inexpressibly sad.

Tennyson has told us w7ith exquisite truth and feeling, how youth looks forward, and hopes in the spring-time, for there is a deep sympathy between the spring-time of the heart and the awakening of nature from its wintry sleep ; and it gives us sometimes a sense of something jarring, and inappropriate, when we see frail humanity sinking to the grave, while"], [257, "Caroline's last grief. 249 every hour the life of nature is ex panding, and giving promise of the wealthier summer. The gay sparkle of Caroline's manner, and the joyous glances of her eyes, had quite disappeared, yet, in the midst of her sorrow and weakness, there was something of the old charm about her, and Laura admired it as much as ever, and did not wonder at poor Mellor's fascination. Sometimes, when she felt better for a few hours, there were touches of her old mischievous ways and impertinent tones, which made Laura smile, in spite of her sadness.

He had not the courage or endurance of Gilbert, who would begin again at the same task an inde finite number of times, if he was but satisfied of reaching his mark at last.

It was useless for Gilbert to assure him that no blame rested upon him, he could not lay the flattering unction to his ow7n soul, and he deter mined, after much consideration, to quit England, and join Mr. Shirley and Walter. He was more tolerant of the failings of others than Gilbert, and felt no bitterness towards his uncle and cousin.

He lingered on the way, and looked lovingly at some familiar spots, with the sad consciousness that it might be many years before he saw them again. Especially he hovered about any little choice bit of landscape, which he had sketched under Sandall's guidance. That is the deep charm of the landscape painter, which outsiders do not understand.

It is not too much to say, that most men really do not know what there is in nature. For what some men see, they might as well be blind. As he approached Merton, George thought of his old life there, and more and more rejoiced, that he had not promised Gilbert to return. He was glad to see his mother once more, and already seemed to feel her arms about his neck, and her kiss upon his cheek, and hoped she would not reproach him too severely, for leaving her. It was pleasant to ramble again through the well-known fields, to see"], [262, "254 MARTYRS TO FASHION. the rich luxuriance of Merton woods, and the silvery light of the wandering stream, but the soul of these sweet pictures had departed.

As he came a little nearer to the village, he left the high road, and took his way through a well-known path, beside the river, which brought him into Merton, near the church. It made him feel unusually sad to hear the bell tolling, as he passed the church yard. It seemed, as if every note told him, in a hollow mysterious voice, that another of his hopes had departed. A few tottering old people, whose faces he knew, came quietly into the churchyard, and George, following them slowly, soon reached the open grave. He enquired whose grave it was, but"], [263, "CAROLINE'S LAST GRIEF. 255 they could not tell him. Someone, however, knew it was a young lady from Coombe. He had never seen Miss Mostyn, but had heard of her from Caroline, and supposed it must be she who had died. At all events, he would wait ; and presently the funeral procession came. It was conducted with great simplicity, and Mr. Chekker read the service with much feeling. Absorbed in the beautiful service, George had not noticed his brother Gilbert and Annie near, but Gilbert, with a gentle touch upon George's shoulder, drew his attention away. \" It is a pity you are here,\" Gilbert said, in a whisper. \"Why,\" George asked. \" Because you are giving yourself unnecessary pain.\""], [264, "256 MARTYRS TO FASHION.

This was Mr. Warren's feeling, exactly. He had been under pressure from his youth, and the body and mind, too, lose their elasticity in time. A more determined policy, and greater self-denial, might have saved him years ago, but things had gone on too long. His creditors had ceased to have any confidence in him, and would hardly wait to give him the opportunity of meeting their claims, by selling off his stock peremptorily. Cruppy thought it strange that nobody would come forward to help the farmer. Generally, in the country, men are to be found willing to give a neighbour assistance, upon anything like reasonable security, but Cruppy was not aware"], [269, "CRUPPY' S TRIUMPH. 261 what expedients Mr. Warren had already adopted.

As he went along, he resolved in his mind many ways of addressing a lady of Miss Mostyn's position, often stopping by the wayside to rehearse his part, for he wished to state the farmer's difficulty in the most dignified way possible, and above all things he was anxious to impress upon her that he come entirely on his own responsibility.

When Miss Mostyn returned, the name of Job Cruppy was sent up, with much tittering, in no way, however, disturbing Cruppy's equanimity, as he was quite contented . to join in the laugh against himself, provided he gained his object. \" Hope you'll forgive the liberty, Miss Mostyn,\" said Cruppy, when he reached Laura's room, \" but things are going so bad, just now, at the Mount Farm, and master seems to have lost his head altogether.\""], [275, "CRUPPY'S TRIUMPH. 267 \"Why, dear me, Cruppy, what is the matter ; you seemed cheerful enough when I wTas there. Indeed, I thought there could not be a happier place than the Mount Farm, anywhere.\" \" And I thought so too,\" rejoined Cruppy,\" and I've been upon the place all my days, but there's nought but trouble there now.\" \"But how came that about?\" \" I think, miss, things have got behind for a long time, and master belonged to some sham company in London, that's failed, and he's called upon to pay up a lot of money. Then, Master Arthur ain't going on well at college.

But tell me, now, Cruppy, what you want me to do. Cruppy, after fumbling in his pockets for some time, produced an enormous posting bill, which gave full particulars of the sale at the farm. \" If anybody went to the sale, and bought on master's account, just enough to set him going, the neighbours wouldn't bid against him, I know.\" \" I will see to that at once, Cruppy, and I think you are a faithful, good hearted fellow for coming to me as you have done.

Michael Warren, not dreaming of the little plot concocted on his behalf, fell into the trap with the greatest facility. Just as Cruppy heard the wheels of Miss Mostyn' s carriage, he engaged the farmer in conversation. He was griev ously humiliated when he saw who the occupant of the carriage was, but Laura gave him no time to escape her. She had left the carriage, and was shaking hands with him in the heartiest manner, before he could think of a word to say. Cruppy, meanwhile, had discreetly dis appeared over a neighbouring stile. \"Now, my dear Mr. Warren, I am"], [278, "270 martyrs to fashion. really almost offended with you for leaving this beautiful place. What is the meaning of it all ?\" \"It means, Miss Mostyn, that I'm a ruined man.\" \"You are really in difficulty?\" \" I certainly am, Miss Mostyn, and I see no way out of it.\" \" Then, pray, why did you not make a friend of me, I am already greatly indebted to you for your hospitality, when we were burnt out, and I shall always feel the Mount Farm to be a second home. I should have called upon you ere now, but for a very sad trouble I have had myself. But tell me who your creditors are, and let us see if we cannot stop the sale.\" Mr. Warren, bewildered, went into the farm with Laura, and gave her a list of names. The sum-total of his"], [279, "CRUPPY'S 'TRIUMPH. 271 debts, made a formidable appearance, but Laura was not easily moved from her purpose. \" I will see these people in the course of a day or two, and let you know what arrangement I can make,\" said Laura, her eyes looking brilliant as twin stars, with the delight of performing a gene rous action. Santi met her on her way home, and he needed little magic to divine what had brought the colour to her cheeks, and the sparkle in her eyes. He had not known Laura Mostyn long, but long enough to discover that nothing added so much to her glorious beauty, nothing gave such sweetness to her tones, as the knowledge that she could relieve some sorrow, or alleviate some pain. Laura lost no time in calling upon the most obstinate of Warren's creditors,"], [280, "272 MARTYRS TO FASHION. and her influence, combined with tangi ble assistance, so far relieved the farmer's more pressing engagements, that the sale was indefinitely postponed."], [281, "CHAPTER XX. MERTON ONCE MORE. Gradually, Annie began to find her interest reviving in her old associations, and as she strove earnestly to make herself more w7orthy of her simple minded and affectionate husband, she felt a piece of mind and quiet happiness which she had not known for a long time. There were hours, even yet, when the life of the timber yard seemed prosaic enough, and the rough voices of the wrorkmen, and the harsh sounds of their labor jarred painfully upon her ears, somewhat over-refined for the everyday incidents, and unromantic details of the vol.

When Miss Mostyn, who became one of Annie's best friends, showed her the beautiful landscape, which had been the turning point of poor Sandall's career, she confessed, with tears in her eyes, that her own disappointment had not been severer than her own vanity"], [283, "275 MERTON ONCE MORE. deserved. If abilities such as poor Caroline's father possessed, had been neglected by the world, for want of a little tact of the possessor, surely she had no reason to complain. George had stayed with them for a few days, before embarking for Mel bourne, but the poor fellow was sorely grieved for the fate of his early love. He remembered only her gay, lively manners, and the piquant sallies of her capricious humor \u2014 her grace, beauty, and talent \u2014 and how heartily he forgave her treatment of himself. He was glad when the time came for the vessel to sail. He went once more to look at one charming view, which had been his favorite trysting place, a spot where the fields and meadows stretched out for mauy a mile, with lofty trees and"], [284, "276 MARTYRS TO FASHION. distant hills, and the silvery, winding Thames gleaming between. How changed his own feelings were, since he last stood in that spot. But the w7indmill w7as flapping its sluggish sails \u2014 the weathercock glittering upon Merton spire \u2014 the barges creeping slowly up the river, as though not a moment had passed. Many a night, when the moon was streaming dow7n upon the vast ocean, and there was not a sound but the ripple of the calm waters beneath the ship, did that scene come back to his memory, and a voice he would hear no more on this side the grave, seemed to enchant his ear. His companions were Mr. Shirley and Walter, who made an effort to regain his old jaunty manners, but the past hung very heavily upon both father and son."], [285, "277 MERTON ONCE MORE. Mr. Shirley was quitting a position in which his name had been important and influential for the best years of his life, to take a subordinate post amongst strangers, and Walter, though he never reproached his father a moment, knew that the reckless scheme in which he had embarked, shut Lord Dufferly's door upon him, and lost him one of the most beautiful girls in London, for her father was rich and proud, and no tears or entreaties would move him, where his honor was concerned. The narrow escape from absolute beggary, Mr. Warren had experienced, was not without good effect. There was an inherent love of bragging in the man, which no misfortune or experience could counteract, but the humiliation of having all his expedients, all his extra vagancies and follies talked about in"], [286, "278 MARTYRS TO FASHION. every farmhouse round Merton, certainly induced more caution than he had ever shown before. Miss Mostyn knew perfectly well that the farmer would never be able to pay back the sums she had advanced, but she did not expect it, and was perfectly contented. With her good husband, and her good heart, she was as happy as one can well be in this world, and many a time did the handsome husband and wife roam down that shady lane, leading from the Mount Farm, and act over again the pleasant scene that led to their present happiness, generally winding up by a call at the farm, when Mr. Warren bustled about, and gave fifty directions in a minute to Cruppy, who executed part of them, and showed the deepest respect for Miss Mostyn, espe ciallv as that ladv seldom left the farm"], [287, "279 MERTON ONCE MORE. without leaving him a substantial token of her good-nature and good-will.

Once or twice he had been heard of at the Manor, but no one had sought his friendship, or took the least interest in him. Mrs. Higgins is still the ruling power at the Mount Farm, working hard, early and late, sneering occasionally at Mrs. Warren, who was as timid as ever, and who found a refuge from all the calami ties of life in her ready flowing tears. Mrs. Higgins blustered and scolded as of yore, but it must be confessed that Cruppy stood higher in her good graces than he had ever done before.
