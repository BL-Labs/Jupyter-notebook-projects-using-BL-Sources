It was evidently the interest of Henry the Seventh, and of James, to be at peace. The English monarch was unpopular ; every attack by a foreign power endangered the stability of his gOArernment, en couraging domestic discontent, and strengthening the hands of his enemies : on the side of the Scottish king there were not similar causes of alarm, for he was strong in the affections of his subjects, and beloved by his nobility ; but grave and AATeighty cares engrossed his attention, and these were of a nature which could be best pursued in a time of peace. The state of the VOL. IV. B"], [24, "1497. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 18 revenue, the commerce and domestic manufactures of his kingdom, and the deficiency of his marine, had noAV begun to occupy an important place in the thoughts of the still youthful sovereign : the disorganized con dition of the more northern portions of his dominions, demanded also the exertion of his utmost vigilance ; so that he listened not unwillingly to Henry's proposals of peace, and to the overture for a matrimonial alliance, which was brought forward by the principal commis sioner of England, Fox bishop of Durham. The pacific disposition of James appears to have been strengthened by the judicious counsels of Pedro D'Ayala, the Spanish envoy at the court of Henry the Seventh. This able foreigner had received orders from his sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella, to visit Scotland as the am bassador from their Catholic majesties; and on his arrival in that country, he soon acquired so strong an influence over this prince, that he did not hesitate to nominate him his chief commissioner for the con ducting his negotiations with England. A seven years' truce was accordingly concluded at Ayton, on the 31st of September, 1497;1 and in a meeting which took place soon after, between William de Warham, Henry's commissioner, and D'Ayala, who appeared on the part of James, it was agreed that this cessa tion of hostilities should continue during the lives of the two monarchs, and for a year after the death of the survivor. Having accomplished this object, the Spanish minister and his suite left the Scottish court, to the regret of the king, who testified by rich presents the regard he entertained for them.2 This negotiation with England being concluded, 1 Rymer, vol. xii. pp. 673, 678, inclusive. a MS.

JAMES IV. 19 James had leisure to turn his attention to his affairs at home ; and although in the depth of winter, with the hardihood which marked his character, he took a pro gress northward as far as Inverness. It was his object personally to inspect the state of these remote portions of his dominions, that he might be able to legislate for them with greater success than had attended the efforts of his predecessors. The policy which he adopted was, to separate and weaken the clans by arraying them in opposition to each other ; to attach to his service by reAvards and preferment some of their ablest leaders ; to maintain a correspondence with the remotest dis tricts, and gradually to accustom their fierce inhabi tants to habits of pacific industry, and a respect for the restraints of the laws. It has been objected to him that his proceedings towards the highland chiefs were occasionally marked by an unbending rigour, and too slight a regard for justice ; but his policy may be vindicated on the ground of necessity, and even of self-defence. These severe measures, however, were seldom re sorted to but in cases of rebellion. To the great body of his nobility, James was uniformly indulgent : the lamentable fate of his father convinced him of the folly of attempting to rule without them. He Avas persuaded that a feudal monarch at war with his nobles was deprived of the greatest sources of his strength and dignity ; and to enable him to direct their efforts to such objects as he had at heart, he endeaAroured to gain their affections. Nor was it difficult to effect this : the course of conduct which his own disposition prompted him to pursue, was the best calculated to render him a favourite with the aristocracy. Under the former reign they seldom saw their prince, but lived in gloomy independence at a distance from court, resorting thither"], [26, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1497. 20 only on occasions of state or counsel ; and Avhen the parliament Avas ended, or the emergency had passed away, they returned to their castles full of complaints against a system which made them strangers to their sovereign, and ciphers in the gwernment. Under James all this was changed. Affable in his manners, fond of magnificence, and devoted to pleasure, the king delighted to see himself surrounded by a splendid nobility : he bestowed upon his highest barons those offices in his household which ensured a familiar atten dance upon his person : his court was a perpetual scene of revelry and amusement, in which the nobles vied with each other in extravagance, and Avhilst they impoverished themselves, became more dependent from this circumstance upon the sovereign. The seclusion and inferior splendour of their own castles became gradually irksome to them ; as their residence was less frequent, the ties which bound their vassals to their service were loosened, whilst the consequence Avas favourable to the royal authority. But amid the splendour of his court, and devotion to his pleasures, James pursued other objects which were truly laudable. Of these the most prominent and the most important Avas his attention to his navy: the enterprises of the Portuguese, and the discoveries of Columbus, had created a sensation at this period throughout every part of Europe, which, in these times, it is perhaps impossible for us to estimate in its full force. Every monarch ambitious of wealth or of glory, became anxious to share in the triumphs of maritime adventure and discovery. Henry the Seventh of Eng- land, although in most cases a cautious and penurious \u25a0 prince, had not hesitated to encourage the celebrated expedition of John Cabot, a Venetian merchant settled at Bristol ; and his unwonted spirit was rewarded by"], [27, "1497. JAMES IV. 21 the discovery of the continent of North America.1 A second voyage conducted by his son Sebastian, one of the ablest navigators of the age, had greatly extended the range of our geographical knowledge ; and the genius of the Scottish prince catching fire at the suc cesses of the neighbouring kingdom, became eager to distinguish itself in a similar career of naval enterprise. But a fleet was Avanting to second these aspirings ; and to supply this became his principal object. His first care was wisely directed to those nurseries of seamen, his domestic fisheries, and his foreign com merce. Deficient in any thing deserving the name of a royal navy, Scotland was nevertheless rich in hardy mariners, and enterprising merchants. A former par liament of this reign had adverted to the great Avealth still lost to the country from the want of a sufficient number of ships, and busses, or boats, to be employed in the fisheries.2 An enactment was now made that vessels of twenty tons and upwards should be built in all the seaports of the kingdom ; whilst the magistrates were directed to compel all stout vagrants AArho fre quented such districts, to learn the trade of mariners, and labour for their OAvn living.3 Amongst his merchants and private traders, the king found some men of ability and experience. Sir Andrew Wood of Largo, the two Bartons, Sir Alex ander Mathison, William Merrimonth of Leith, Avhose 1 Mr Biddel in his Life of Sebastian Cabot, a work of great acuteness and research, has endeavoured to show that the discovery of North America belongs solely to Sebastian, and not to John, Cabot. From the examination of his proofs and authorities, I have arrived at an opposite conclusion. The reader who is interested in the subject will find it discussed in the Appendix to \"A Historical View of the Progress of Discovery in North America.\" 2 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 235. \" Anent the greit innumerable riches yat is tint in fault of schippis and buschis.\" 3 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. ii. pp. 17, 18."], [28, "1497. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 22 skill in maritime affairs had procured him the title of \" king of the sea,\" and various other naval adventurers of inferior note, were sought out by James, and treated with peculiar favour and distinction. They were en couraged to extend their voyages, to arm their trading vessels, to purchase foreign ships of war, to import cannon, and to superintend the building of ships of force at home. In these cares the monarch not only took an interest, but studied the subjects with his usual enthusiasm, and personally superintended every detail. He conversed with his mariners ; rewarded the most skilful and assiduous by presents ; visited familiarly at the houses of his principal merchants and sea officers ; practised with his artillerymen, often discharging and pointing the guns, and delighted in embarking on short voyages of experiment, in which, under the tuition of Wood or the Bartons, he became acquainted with the practical parts of navigation. The consequences of such conduct were highly favourable to him : he became as popular with his sailors as he was beloved by his nobility ; his fame was carried by them to foreign countries ; ship-wrights, cannon-founders, and foreign artisans of every description, flocked to his court from France, Italy, and the Low Countries ; and if amongst these were some impostors, whose pretensions imposed upon the royal credulity, there Avere others by whose skill and genius Scotland rose in the scale of knowledge and importance. But the attention of James to his navy and his foreign commerce, although conspicuous, was not ex clusive ; his energy and activity in the administration of justice, in the suppression of crime, and in the regu lation of the police of his dominions, were equally remarkable. Under the feudal government, as it then existed in Scotland, the obedience paid to the laws"], [29, "1497. JAMES IV. 23 and the consequent increase of industry and security of property, were dependent in a great degree upon the personal character of the sovereign. Indolence and inactivity in the monarch commonly led to disorder and oppression. The stronger nobles oppressed their weaker neighbours; murder and spoliation of every kind were practised by their vassals ; whilst the judges, deprived of the countenance and protection of their prince, either did not dare or did not choose to punish the delinquents. Personal vigour in the king was in variably accompanied by a diminution of crime and a respect for the laws ; and never was a sovereign more indefatigable than James in visiting with this object every district of his dominions ; travelling frequently alone, at night, and in the most inclement seasons, to great distances ; surprising the judge, when he least expected, by his sudden appearance on the tribunal, and striking terror into the heart of the guilty by the rapidity and certainty of the royal vengeance. Pos sessed of an athletic frame, which was strengthened by a familiarity with all the warlike exercises of the age, the king thought little of throwing himself on his horse and riding a hundred miles before he dreAV bridle ; and, on one occasion, it is recorded of him, that he rode un attended from his palace of Stirling in a single day to Elgin, where he permitted himself but a feAV hours' repose, and then pushed on to the shrine of St Duthoc in Ross.1 Whilst the monarch Avas occupied in these actiATe but pacific cares, an event occurred which, in its con sequences, threatened once more to plunge the two countries into war. A party of Scottish youths, some of -them highly born, crossed the Tweed at Norham, 1 Lesley's History, Bannatyne edit. p. 76."], [30, "1498-9. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 24 and trusting to the protection of the truce, visited the castle ; but the national antipathy led to a misunder standing : they were accused of being spies, attacked by orders of the governor, and driven with ignominy and wounds across the river. James's chivalrous sense of honour fired at this outrage, and he despatched a herald to England, demanding inquiry, and denoun cing war if it Avere refused. It was fortunate, however, that the excited passions of this prince were met by quietude and prudence upon the part of Henry; he represented the event in its true colours, as an unpre meditated and accidental attack, for which he felt regret, and was ready to afford redress. Fox, the Bishop of Durham, to whom the castle belonged, made ample submissions ; and the king, conciliated by his flattery, aud convinced by his arguments of the ruinous impolicy of a war, allowed himself to be appeased. Throughout the whole negotiation, the Avisdom and moderation of Henry presented a striking contrast to the foolish and overbearing impetuosity of the Scottish monarch : it was hoped, however, that this headstrong temper would be subdued by his arrival at a maturer age ; and in the meantime the English king despatched to the Scottish court his vice-admiral, Rydon, to obtain from James the final ratification of the truce, which was given at Stirling on the 20th of July, 1499.1 In the midst of these threatenings of war, Avhich were thus happily averted, it is pleasing to mark the efforts of an enlightened policy for the dissemination of learning. By an act of a former parliament, (1496,)2 it had been made imperative on all barons and free holders, under a fine of twenty pounds, to send their 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xii. p. 728. 2 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 238."], [31, "1500. JAMES IV. 25 sons, at the age of nine years, to the schools, Avhere they were to be competently founded in Latin, and to remain afterwards three years at the schools of \" Art and Jury,\" so as to ensure their possessing a know ledge of the laws. The object of this statute was to secure the appointment of learned persons to fill the office of sheriffs, that the poorer classes of the people might not be compelled, from the ignorance of such judges, to appeal to a higher tribunal. These efforts were seconded by the exertions of an eminent and learned prelate, Elphinston bishop of Aberdeen, who now completed the building of King's College in that city, for the foundation of which he had procured the papal bull in 1494. In the devout spirit of the age, its original institutions embraced the maintenance of eight priests and seven singing boys ; but it supported also professors of divinity, of the civil and canon law, of medicine and humanity ; fourteen students of philo sophy and ten bachelors were educated within its walls : nor is it unworthy of record, that its first Prin cipal was the noted Hector Boece, the correspondent of Erasmus, and a scholar whose classical attainments and brilliant fancy had already procured for him the distinction of professor of philosophy in Montague College at Paris. Scotland noAV possessed three universities : that of St Andrews, founded in the commencement of the fifteenth century ; Glasgow, in the year 1453 ; and Aberdeen, in 1500. Fostered amid the security of peace, the muses began to raise their heads from the slumber into which they had fallen ; and the genius of Dunbar and Douglas, emu lated in their native language the poetical triumphs of Chaucer and of Gower.1 1 Memoirs of William Dunbar, p. 45, prefixed to Mr Laing's beau tiful edition of that poet."], [32, "1500-2. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 26 It was about this time that James concluded a de fensive alliance with France and Denmark ; and Henry the Seventh, who began to be alarmed lest the monarch should be flattered by Lewis the Twelfth into a still more intimate intercourse, renewed his proposals for a marriage with his daughter. The wise policy of a union between the Scottish king and the Princess Margaret had suggested itself to the councillors of both countries some years before ; but the extreme youth of the intended bride, and an indisposition upon the part of James to interrupt by more solemn ties the love which he bore to his mistress, Margaret Drummond, the daughter of Lord Drummond, had for a while put an end to all negotiations on the subject. His continued attachment, however, the birth of a daughter, and perhaps the dread of female influence over the impetuous character of the king, began to alarm his nobility, and James felt disposed to listen to their remonstrances. He accordingly despatched his commissioners, the Bishop of Glasgow, the Earl of Bothwell his high admiral, and Andrew Forman, apostolical prothonotary, to meet with those of Henry; and, after some interval of debate and negotiation, the marriage treaty was concluded and signed in the palace of Richmond, on the 24th of January, 1502.1 It was stipulated, that as the princess had not yet completed her tAvelfth year, her father should not be obliged to send her to Scotland before the 1st of Sep tember, 1503 ; whilst James engaged to espouse her within fifteen days after her arrival.2 The queen was immediately to be put in possession of all the lands, castles, and manors, whose revenues constituted the 1 Rymer, Foedera, vol. xii. pp. 776, 777; 787. 3 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xii. p. 765, gives the dispensation for the marriage.

JAMES IV. 27 jointure of the queens-dowager of Scotland ; and it was stipulated that their annual amount should not be under the sum of two thousand pounds sterling. She was to receive, during the lifetime of the king her husband, a pension of five hundred marks, equivalent to one thousand pounds of Scottish money ; and, in the event of James's death, was to be permitted to reside at her pleasure, either within or without the limits of Scotland. On the part of Henry, her dowery, considering his great wealth, was not munificent. It was fixed at thirty thousand nobles, or ten thousand pounds sterling, to be paid by instalments within three years after the marriage.1 Besides her Scottish servants, the princess was to be at liberty to keep twenty-four English domestics, men and women ; and her household was to be maintained by her husband in a state conformable to her high rank as the daughter and consort of a king. It was lastly agreed, that should the queen die without issue before the three years had expired within which her dowery was to be paid, the balance should not be demanded ; but in the event of her death, leaving issue, the whole sum was 1 At a period as remote as 1281, when silver was far more valuable than in 1502, Alexander the Third gave with his daughter to the King of Norway the value of nine thousand three hundred and thirty three pounds of standard silver, one half in money, for the other half an annuity in lands, valued at ten years' purchase, whilst the stipu lated jointure was to be ten per cent of her portion. Henry the Seventh, on the other hand, when it might be thought more necessary for him to conciliate the affection of his son-in-law, gives only five thousand seven hundred and fourteen pounds, silver of the same standard, and stipulates for his daughter a jointure of twenty per cent, besides an allowance for her privy purse. \u2014 M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. iv. in Appendix, Chronological Table of Prices.

The tender age of the young princess, however, still prevented her immediate union with the king, and in the interval a domestic tragedy occurred at court, of which the causes are as dark as the event was deplor able. It has been already noticed that James, whose better qualities were tarnished by an indiscriminate devotion to his pleasures, had, amid other temporary amours, selected as his mistress Lady Margaret Drum mond, the daughter of a noble house, which had already given a queen to Scotland. At first little anxiety Avas felt at such a connexion ; the nobles, in the plurality of the royal favourites, imagined there existed a safe guard for the royal honour, and looked with confidence to James's fulfilling his engagements with England ; but his infatuation seemed to increase in proportion as the period for the completion of the marriage ap proached. His coffers were exhausted to keep up the 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xii. pp. 787, 792, inclusive. 3 The portion of C\u00e6cilia was 20,000 marks, equal to \u00a313,333 English money of that age. \u2014 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. xi. pp. 825, 836. 3 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 41."], [35, "JAMES IV. 1502. 29 splendid establishment of his mistress : large sums of money, rich dresses, grants of land to her relations and needy domestics, all contributed to drain the revenue, whilst her influence must have been alarming. The treaty was yet unconfirmed by the oath of the king, and his wisest councillors began to dread the consequences. It was in this state of things that, Avhen residing at Drummond castle, Lady Margaret, along with her sisters, Euphemia and Sybilla, were suddenly seized Avith an illness which attacked them immediately after a repast, and soon after died in great torture, their last struggles exhibiting, it was said, the symptoms of poison. The bodies of the fair sufferers Avere instantly carried to Dunblane, and there buried Avith a precipitancy which increased the suspicion ; yet no steps were taken to arrive at the truth by disin terment or examination. It is possible that a slight misunderstanding between James and Henry concern ing the withdraAving the title of King of France, which the Scottish monarch had inadvertently per mitted to be given to his intended father-in-law,1 may have had the effect of exciting the hopes of the Drum monds, and reviving the alarm of the nobles, who adopted this horrid means of removing the subject of their fears ; or we may, perhaps, look for a solution of the mystery in the jealousy of a rival house, which shared in the munificence and disputed for the affec tions of the king.2 From the sad reflections Avhich must have clouded his mind on this occasion, the monarch suddenly turned, Avith his characteristic versatility and energy, to the cares of government. 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xiii. pp. 43, 44. 2 The Lady Jennet Kennedy, daughter of John lord Kennedy, bad born a son to the king, whom James created Earl of Moray."], [36, "1502.

The Scottish auxiliaries, in conjunction with- the Danish force and a squadron furnished by the elector of Brandenburg, were commanded by Christiern prince royal of Den mark, and the insurgent Norwegians for the time completely reduced, whilst their chief, Hermold, was taken prisoner and executed. James's fleet noAV re turned to Scotland ; the artillery and ammunition Avhich formed their freight were carried to the castle of Edinburgh, and a mission of SnoAvdon herald to the Danish king, to whom James sent a present of a coat of gold, evinced the friendly alliance Avhich existed between the two countries.1 All was now ready for the approaching nuptials of the king. The pope had given his dispensation, and confirmed the treaties ; James had renewed his oath for their observation ; and the youthful bride, under the care of the Earl of Surrey, and surrounded by a splendid retinue, set out on her journey to Scotland. Besides Surrey and his train, the Earl of Northum berland, Lord Dacre, the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Durham, and other civil and ecclesiastical grandees, accompanied the princess, who was now in her fourteenth year ; and, at Lamberton kirk, in Lam mermuir, she was met by the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Earl of Morton, and a train of Scottish barons. The royal tents which had been sent forward were now pitched for her reception ; and, according to the 1 This expedition of the Scottish ships to Denmark, in 1502-3, is not to be found in Pinkerton.

JAMES IV. 31 terms of the treaty, the Earl of Northumberland de livered her with great solemnity to the commissioners of the king. The cavalcade then proceeded towards Dalkeith. When she reached Newbattle, she was met by the prince himself, with all the ardour of a youth ful lover, eager to do honour to the lady of his heart. The interview is described by an eye-witness, and presents a curious picture of the manners of the times. Darting, says he, like a hawk on its quarry, James eagerly entered her chamber, and found her playing at cards : he then, after an embrace, entertained her by his performance upon the clarichord and the lute : on taking leave, he sprung upon a beautiful courser without putting his foot in the stirrup, and pushing the animal to the top of his speed, left his train far behind.1 At the next meeting the princess exhibited her musical skill, whilst the king listened on bended knee, and highly commended the performance. When she left Dalkeith to proceed to the capital, James met her, mounted on a bay horse, trapped with gold ; he and the nobles in his train riding at full gallop, and suddenly checking and throAving their steeds on their haunches, to exhibit the firmness of their seat. A singular chivalrous exhibition noAV took place ; a knight appeared on horseback, attended by a beautiful lady, holding his bridle and carrying his hunting horn. He was assaulted by Sir Patrick Hamilton, who seized the damsel, and a mimic conflict took place, which concluded by the king throwing down his gage and calling \"peace.\" On arriving at the suburbs, the princess descended from her litter, and, mounted upon a pillion behind the royal bridegroom, rode through the streets of the city to the palace, amid the accla- 1 Leland, Collectanea, vol. iv. p. 284."], [38, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1502. 32 mations of the people.1 On the 8th of August, the ceremony of the marriage was performed by the Archbishop of St Andrews, in the abbey church of Holyrood; and the festivities which followed were still more splendid than those which had preceded it. Feasting, masques, morris dances, and dramatic en tertainments, occupied successive nights of revelry. Amid the tournaments which were exhibited, the king appeared in the character of the Savage Knight, sur rounded by Avild men disguised in goat skins ; and by his uncommon skill in these martial exercises, car ried off the prize from all Avho competed with him. Besides the English nobles, many foreigners of dis tinction attended the wedding, amongst whom, one of the most illustrious was Anthony D'Arsie de la Bastie, who fought in the barriers with Lord Hamilton, after they had tilted with grinding spears. Hamilton was nearly related to the king ; and so pleased was James with his magnificent retinue and noble appearance in honour of his marriage, that he created him Earl of Arran on the third day after the ceremony.2 De la Bastie also was loaded with gifts ; the Countess of Surrey, the Archbishop of York,3 the officers of the queen's household, doAvn to her meanest domestic, ex perienced the liberality of the monarch ; and the revels broke up, amidst enthusiastic aspirations for his hap piness, and commendations of his unexampled gene rosity and gallantry. Scarce had these scenes of public rejoicing concluded, when a rebellion broke out in the north which demanded the immediate attention of the king. The measures ' Leland, Collectanea, vol. iv. p. 286-7. 2 Mag. Sig. xiii. 639. Aug. 11, 1503. 3 Accounts of the Lord High-treasurer, sub anno 1503. August 9 11, 12, 13. &"], [39, "1502. JAMES IV. 33 pursued by James in the Highlands and the Isles, had been hitherto followed Avith complete success. He had visited these remote districts in person ; their fierce chiefs had submitted to his power; and in 1495 he had returned to his capital, leading captive the only two delinquents who offered any serious resistance, Mac kenzie of Kintail, and Macintosh, heir to the captain of clan Chattan. From this period till the year 1499, in the autumn of which the monarch held his court in south Kentire, all appears to have remained in tranquillity ; but after his return (from Avhat causes cannot be dis covered) a complete change took place in the policy of the king; and the wise and moderate measures already adopted, Avere succeeded by proceedings so severe as to border on injustice. The charters which had been granted during the last six years to the vassals of the Isles, were summarily revoked. Archibald earl of Argyle was installed in the office of lieutenant, Avith the ample and invidious power of leasing out the entire lordship of the Isles.1 The ancient proprietors and their vassals were violently expelled from their here ditary property ; whilst Argyle and other royal fa vourites appear to have been enriched by neAV grants of their estates and lordships. We are not to wonder that such harsh proceedings were loudly reprobated : the inhabitants saw, with indignation, their rightful masters exposed to insult and indigence, and at last broke into open rebellion. Donald Dhu, grandson of John lord of the Isles, had been shut up for forty years a solitary captive in the castle of Inchconnal. His mother was a daughter of the first Earl of Argyle ; and although there is no doubt that both he and his 1 The island of Isla, and the lands of north and south Kentire, were alone excepted. VOL.

To reinstate him in his right, and place him upon the throne of the Isles was the object of the present re bellion.2 A party led by the Mac-Ians of Glencoe, broke into his dungeon, liberated him from his capti vity, and carried him in safety to the castle of Torquil Macleod in the Lewis; whilst measures were con certed throughout the wide extend of the Isles for the establishment of their independence and the destruc tion of the regal power. Although James received early intelligence of the meditated insurrection, and laboured by every method to dissolve the union amongst its confederated chiefs, it now burst forth with destructive fury. Badenoch was wasted with all the ferocity of Highland warfare, Inverness given to the flames ; and so widely and rapidly did the con tagion of independence spread throughout the Isles, that it demanded the most prompt and decisive measures to arrest it. But James's power, though shook, was too deeply rooted to be thus destroyed^ The Avhole array of the kingdom was called forth. The Earls of Argyle, Huntley, Crawford, and Marshal, Avith Lord Lovat and other barons, were appointed to lead an army against the islanders ; the castles and strongholds in the hands of the king were fortified and garrisoned; letters were addressed to the various chiefs, encouraging the loyal by the rewards which awaited them, whilst over the heads of the wavering or dis affected were suspended the terrors of forfeiture and execution. But this was not all : a parliament assem bled at Edinburgh on the 11th of March, 1503,3 and 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 247. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. pp. 239, 249."], [41, "1503. JAMES IV. 35 in addition to the aboA-e vigorous resolutions, the civilisation of the Highlands, an object which had en grossed the attention of many a successive council, was again taken into consideration. To accomplish this end, those districts whose inhabitants had hitherto, from their inaccessible position, defied the restraints of the law, were divided into new sheriffdoms, and placed under the jurisdiction of permanent judges. The pre amble of the act complained in strong terms of the gross abuse of justice in the northern and western divisions of the realm, more especially the Isles ; it described the people as having become altogether savage, and provided that the new sheriffs for the north Isles should hold their courts in Inverness and Dingwall, and those for the south in the Tarbet of Lochkilkerran. The inhabitants of Dowart, Glen dowart, and the lordship of Lorn, who for a long period had violently resisted the jurisdiction of the justice-ayres or ambulatory legal courts, were com manded to come to the justice-ayre at Perth ; and the districts of MaAvmor and Lochaber, which had in sisted on the same exemption, were brought under the jurisdiction of the justice-ayre of Inverness.

The districts of Ross and Caithness, now separated from the sheriffdom of Inverness, were placed under their own judges ; and it Avas directed that the inhabitants of these three great divisions of the kingdom should as usual attend the justice-ayre of Inverness."], [42, "1503. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 36 It appears that, for the purpose of quieting the lowland districts, the king had adopted a system, not uncommon in those times, of engaging the most power ful of the resident nobles and gentry in a covenant or \" band,\" Avhich, under severe penalties, obliged them to maintain order throughout the country. By such means the blessings of security and good government had been enjoyed by Dumfriesshire, a district hitherto much disturbed ; and the Earl of Bothwell now ear nestly recommended a similar method to be pursued in the reduction of Teviotdale. In the same parliament a court of daily council Avas appointed, the judges of which were to be selected by the king, and to hold their sittings in Edinburgh. The object of this new institution was to relieve the lords of the \" Session\" of the confusion and pressure of business, which had arisen from the great accumu lation of cases, and to afford immediate redress to those poorer litigants whose matters had been delayed from year to year. The ferocity of feudal manners, and the gradual introduction of legal subtilties were strikingly blended in another laAV passed at this time, by Avhich it was directed, that no remissions or par dons were hereafter to contain a general clause for all offences, as it was found, that by this form, much abuse of justice had been introduced. A ferocious ruffian, for example, Avho to the crime of murder had, as was generally the case, added many inferior offences, in purchasing his remission, was in the practice of stating only the minor delinquency, and afterwards pleading that the murder was included under the pardon. It was now made imperative, that before any remission was granted, the highest offence should be ascertained, and minutely described in the special clause ; it being permitted to the offender to plead"], [43, "150.3. JAMES IV. 37 his remission for all crimes of a minor description. The usual interdiction was repeated against all ex- port of money forth of the realm ; forty shillings being fixed as the maximum which any person might carry out of the country. The collection of the royal cus- toms was more strictly ensured : it was enjoined, that the magistrates of all burghs should be annually changed ; that no Scottish merchants should carry on a litigation beyond seas, in any court but that of the Conservator, who was to be assisted by a council of six of the most able merchants, and was commanded to visit Scotland once every year. The burghs of the realm were amply secured in the possession of their ancient privileges, and warning was given to their commissaries or head men, that when any tax was to be proposed, or contribution granted by the parliament, they should be careful to attend and give their ad- vice in that matter as one of the three estates of the realm ; a provision demonstrating the obsoleteness of some of the former laws upon this subject, and proving that an attendance upon the great council of the king- dom was still considered a grievance by the more la- borious classes of the community. With regard to the higher landed proprietors, they Avere strongly enjoined to take seisin, and enter upon the superiority of their lands, so that the vassals Avho held under them might not be injured by their neglect of this important legal solemnity ; whilst every judge, Avho upon a precept from the Chancery had given seisin to any baron, was directed to keep an attested register of such proceed ing in a court-book, to be lodged in the Exchequer. It appears, by a provision of the same parliament, that \"the green wood of Scotland\" Avas then utterly destroyed : a remarkable change from the picture for merly given in this Avork of the extensive forests AAThich"], [44, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1503. 38 once covered the face of the country. To remedy this, the fine for the felling or burning of growing timber was raised to five pounds, whilst it was ordered that every lord, or laird, in those districts where there were no great woods or forests, should plant at the least one acre, and attempt to introduce a farther improvement, by enclosing a park for deer, Avhilst he attended also to his warrens, orchards, hedges, and dovecots. All park-breakers and trespassers within the enclosures of a landholder, were to be fined in the sum often pounds; and if the delinquency should be committed by a child, he was to be delivered by his parents to the judge, who was enjoined to administer corporal correction in pro portion to its enormity. In the quaint language of the act, \" the bairn is to be lashed, scourged, and dung, according to the fault.\" All vassals, although it Avas a time of peace, were commanded to have their arms and harness in good order, to be inspected at the annual military musters, or weapon-schawings. By an act passed in the year 1457, it had been recommended to the king, lords, and prelates, to let their lands in \"few farm;\" but this injunction, which, when followed, was highly beneficial to the country, had fallen so much into disuse that its legality was disputed : it loosened the strict ties of the feudal system, by permitting the farmers and labourers to exchange their military ser vices for the payment of a land rent ; and although it promoted agricultural improvement, it was probably opposed by a large body of the barons, who were jea lous of any infringement upon their privileges. The benefits of the system, however, were now once more recognized. It was declared lawful for the sovereign, his prelates, nobles, and landholders, to \"set their lands in few,\" under any condition Avhich they mioht judge expedient ; taking care, however, that by such"], [45, "1503. JAMES IV. 39 leases the annual income of their estates should not be diminished to the prejudice of their successors. No creditor was to be permitted to seize for debt, or to order the sale of any instruments of agriculture : an equalisation of weights and measures was com manded to be observed throughout the realm : it was ordained that the most remote districts of the country, including the Isles, should be amenable to the same laws as the rest of the kingdom : severe regulations Avere passed for an examination into the proper quali fications of notaries ; and an attempt was made to reduce the heavy expenses of litigation, and for the suppression of strong and idle paupers. The parlia ment concluded by introducing a law which materially affected its own constitution. All barons or free holders, whose annual revenue was beloAV the sum of one hundred marks of the new extent, established in 1424, Avere permitted to absent themselves from the meeting of the three estates, provided they sent their procurators to answer for them ; whilst all Avhose income was above that sum, were, under the usual fine, to be compelled to attend.1 Such were the most remarkable provisions of this important meeting of the three estates ; but in these times the difficulty did not so much consist in the making good laAVS, as in carrying them into execution. This was particularly experienced in the case of the Isles, Avhere the rebellion still raged with so much violence, that it Avas found necessary to despatch a small naval squadron, under Sir AndreAV Wood and Robert Barton, two of the most skilful officers in the country, to co-operate with the land army, which was commanded by the Earl of Arran, lieutenant-general 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 240-254."], [46, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1504. 40 of the king.1 James, who at present meditated an expedition in person against the broken clans of Esk dale and Teviotdale, could not accompany his fleet farther than Dunbarton.2 The facility with which Wood and Barton reduced the strong insular castle of Carneburgh, Avhich had attempted to stand a siege, and compelled the insurgent chiefs to abandon their attempts at resistance, convinced him, that in his attention to his navy, he had not too highly estimated its importance. Aware, also, of the uncommon energy Avith which the monarch directed his military and naval resources, and witnessing the rapidity with which delinquents were overtaken by the royal ven geance, Macleod, Mac-Ian, and others of the most powerful of the island lords, adopted the wiser policy of supporting the crown, being rewarded for their fidelity by sharing in the forfeited estates of the rebels.3 A temporary tranquillity having been thus estab lished in the north, the king proceeded, at the head of a force which overaAved all opposition, into Eskdale. Information was sent to the English monarch, re questing him to co-operate in this attempt to reduce the warlike borderers, Avhose habits of plunder Avere prejudicial to the security of either country ; and Lord Dacre, the warden, received his master's instructions to meet the Scottish king and afford him every assis tance.

He was attended in his progress by his huntsmen, falconers, morris dancers, and all the motley and various minions of his pleasures, as well as by his judges and ministers of the law ; and whilst troops of the unfortunate marauders were seized and brought in irons to the encampment, executions and entertainments appear to have succeeded each other with extraordinary rapidity.1 The severity of the monarch to all who had disturbed the peace of the country was as re markable as his kindness and affability to the lowest of his subjects who respected the laws ; and many of the ferocious borderers, to whom the love of plunder had become a second nature, but who promised them selves immunity because they robbed within the Eng lish pale, lamented on the scaffold the folly of such anticipation. The Armstrongs, hoAvever, appear at this time to have made their peace with the crown ;2 whilst the Jardines, and probably other poAverful septs, purchased a freedom from minute inquiry, by an active co-operation with the measures of the sovereign.

In 1504, great efforts had been made, but with little permanent success, and the progress of the insurrection became alarming. Macvicar, an envoy from Macleod, who was then in strict alliance with the king, remained three weeks at court : Mac-Ian also had sent his emis saries to explain the perilous condition of the country; and, with his characteristic energy, the king, as soon as the state of the year permitted, despatched the Earl of Huntley to invade the Isles by the north, Avhilst himself in person led an army against them from the south ; and John Barton proceeded with a fleet to reduce and overawe these savage districts. 2 The terror of the royal name, the generosity with which James rewarded his adherents, and the vigorous measures which he adopted against the disaffected, produced a speedy and extensive effect in dissolving the confederacy. Maclean of Dowart, Macquarrie of Ulva, with Macneill of Barra, and Mackinnon, offered their submission, and were received into favour ; and the succeeding year (1506) Avitnessed the utter de struction of Torquil Macleod, the great head of the rebellion, whose castle of Stornaway, in Lewis, was stormed by Huntley ; whilst Donald Dhu, the captive upon whose aged head his vassals had made this des perate attempt to place the crown of the Isles, escaping the gripe of the conqueror, fled to Ireland, where he soon after died.3 1 Treasurer's Accounts, 1504, sub mense Oct.

JAMES IV. 43 It was noAV proper for the monarch to look to his foreign relations, to seize the interval of peace at home, that he might strengthen his ties with the continent. France, the ally of Scotland, had been too constantly occupied with hostilities in Italy to take an interest in preventing the negotiations for the marriage of the king to the Princess of England. The conquest of the Milanese by the arms of Lewis the Twelfth, in which Robert Stuart lord of Aubigny had distinguished him self, and the events which succeeded in the partition of the kingdom of Naples between the Kings of France and Castile, concentrated the attention of both mo narchs upon Italy, and rendered their intercourse with Britain less frequent. But when the quarrel regarding the division of the kingdom of Naples broke out between Ferdinand and Lewis, in 1503, and the defeats of Seminara and Cerignola had established the superior ity of the Spanish arms in Italy, negotiations betAveen LeAvis and the Scottish court appear to have been renewed. The causes of this were obvious. Henry the Seventh of England esteemed none of his foreign alliances so highly as that with Spain ; his eldest son, Arthur, had espoused Catharine the Infanta ; and, on the death of her husband, a dispensation had been procured from the pope for her marriage Avith his brother Henry, now Prince of Wales. It Avas evident to Lewis, that his rupture with Spain AATas not unlikely to bring on a quarrel with England, and it became therefore of consequence to reneAV his negotiations Avith James the Fourth. These, however, were not the only foreign cares abroad. Some of their ships, which had been cruising against the English in 1497, had been seized and plundered on the coast of Brit tany, and a remonstrance was addressed to Lewis the Twelfth, by Panter, the royal secretary, which complained of the injustice, and insisted on redress. [Epistol\u00e6 Regum Scotorum, vol. i. pp. 17, 18.]"], [50, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1505-6. 44 Avhich attracted the attention of the king. In the autumn of the year 1505, Charles D'Egraont duke of Gueldres, a prince of spirit and ability, who Avith difficulty maintained his dominions against the un just attacks of the Emperor Maximilian, despatched his secretary on an embassy to the Scottish monarch, requesting his interference and support.1 Nor was this denied him. The duke had listened to the advice of the Scottish prince when he requested him to with draw his intended aid from the unfortunate Edmund de la Pole earl of Suffolk, the representative of the House of York, who had sought a refuge at his court ; and James now anxiously exerted himself in his behalf. He treated his envoy with distinction ; despatched an embassy to the duke, Avhich, in passing through France, secured the assistance of LeAvis the Twelfth, and so effectually remonstrated with Henry the Seventh and the Emperor Maximilian, that all active designs against the duchy of Gueldres Avere for the present abandoned.2 In the midst of these transactions, and whilst the presence of Huntley, Barton, and the Scottish fleet Avas still necessary in the Isles, the more pacific parts of the country were filled Avith joy by the birth of a prince, which took place at Holyrood on the 10th of February, 1506. None could testify greater satisfaction at this event than the monarch himself.3 He instantly de spatched messengers to carry the news to the kings of England, France, Spain, and Portugal ; and, on the 23d of February, the baptism was held with magnificence in the chapel of Holyrood. The boy was named James, after his father ; but the sanguine hopes of the kingdom were, within a year, clouded by his premature death. 1 Accounts of the High Treasurer, 1505, Sept. 6. 3 Ibid. 1506, July 6 and 8.

JAMES IV. 45 At this conjuncture an embassy from Pope Julius the Second arrived at the court of Scotland. Alarmed at the increasing power of the French in Italy, this pontiff had united his strength Avith that of the Emperor Maximilian and the Venetians, to check the arms of Lewis, whilst he noAV attempted to induce the Scottish monarch to desert his ancient ally. The endeavour, however, proved fruitless. James, indeed, reverently received the papal ambassador, gratefully accepted the consecrated hat and SAVord which he presented, and loaded him and his suite Avith presents ; he communi cated also the intelligence Avhich he had lately received from the King of Denmark, that his ally, the Czar of Muscovy, had intimated a desire to be received into the bosom of the Latin church ; but he detected the political finesse of the warlike Julius, and remained steady to his alliance with France. Nay, scarcely had the ambassador left his court, when he proposed to send LeAvis a body of four thousand auxiliaries to serve in his Italian wars, an offer which the rapid successes of that monarch enabled him to decline. Turning his attention from the continent to his affairs at home, the king recognized with satisfaction the effects of his exertions, in enforcing, by severity and indefatigable personal superintendence, a universal respect for the laws. The husbandman laboured his lands in security, the merchant traversed the country with his goods, the foreign trader visited the markets of the various burghs and seaports fearless of plunder or interruption ; and so convinced was the monarch of the success of his efforts, that, with a whimsical enthusiasm, he determined to put it to a singular test. Setting out on horseback, unaccompanied even by a groom, with nothing but his riding cloak cast about him, his hunting knife at his belt, and six-and-twenty"], [52, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1508. 46 pounds for his travelling expenses in his purse, he rode, in a single day, from Stirling to Perth, across the Mounth, and through Aberdeen to Elgin ; whence, after a feAV hours' repose, he pushed on to the shrine of St Duthoc in Ross, where he heard mass. In this feat of bold and solitary activity, the unknown mo narch met not a moment's interruption ; and after having boasted, Avith an excusable pride, of the tran quillity to which he had reduced his dominions, he returned in a splendid progress to his palace at Stir ling, accompanied by the principal nobles and gentry of the districts through which he passed. Soon after, he despatched the Archbishop of St Andrews and the Earl of Arran to the court of France, for the purpose of procuring certain privileges regarding the mercantile intercourse between the two countries, and to fix upon the line of policy which appeared best for their mutual interest regarding the complicated affairs of Italy. In that country an important change had taken place. The brilliant successes of the Vene tians against the arms of Maximilian had alarmed the jealousy of Lewis, and led to an inactivity on his part, which terminated in a total rupture ; whilst the peace concluded between the Emperor and James's ally and relative, the Duke of Gueldres, formed, as is Avell known, the basis of the league of Cambrai, which united, against the single republic of Venice, the apparently irresistible forces of the pope, the emperor, and the kings of France and Spain. For the purpose, no doubt, of inducing the king to become a party to this powerful coalition, Lewis now sent the veteran Aubigny to the Scottish court, with the President of Toulouse;1 and the monarch, who loved the ambas- 1 \" Vicesima prima Martii antedicti, Galli\u00e6 oratores, D\"us videlicet D'Aubeny et alter, supplicationum regi\u00e6 domus Magister, octoginta"], [53, "1509. JAMES IV. 47 sador for his extraction, and venerated his celebrity in arms, received him Avith distinction. Tournaments were held in honour of his arrival ; he was placed by the king in the highest seat at his own table, appealed to as supreme judge in the lists, and addressed by the title of Father of War. This eminent person had visited Scotland twenty-five years before, as ambassa dor from Charles the Eighth to James the Third ; and it was under his auspices that the league between the two countries was then solemnly renewed. He now returned to the land which contained the ashes of his ancestors, full of years and of honour ; but it was only to mingle his dust with theirs, for he sickened almost immediately after his arrival, and died at Cor storphine.1 Another object of Lewis in this embassy was to consult with James regarding the marriage of his eldest daughter, to whom Charles king of Castile, then only eight years old, had been proposed as a husband. Her hand was also sought by Francis of Valois dauphin of Vienne ; and the French monarch declared that he could not decide on so important a question without the advice of his allies, of whom he considered Scot land both the oldest and the most friendly. To this James replied, that since his brother of France had honoured him by asking his advice, he Avould give it frankly as his opinion, that the princess ought to marry within her own realm of France, and connect herself rather with him who was to succeed to the crown than with any foreign potentate; this latter being a union out of Avhich some colourable or equis egregie comitati, urbuem ingressi snt, Scotiam petituri.\" Narratio Hist, de gestis Henrici VII. per Bernardum Andream Tholosatem.

The ad vice was satisfactory, for it coincided with the course which LeAvis had already determined to follow. Happy in the affections of his subjects, and gratified by observing an evident increase in the wealth and industry of the kingdom, the king found leisure to relax from the severer cares of government, and to gratify the inhabitants of the capital by one of those exhibitions of which he was fond even to weakness. A magnificent tournament was held at Edinburgh, in which the monarch enacted the part of the Wild Knight, attended by a troop of ferocious companions disguised as savages ; Sir Anthony D'Arsie and many of the French nobles who had formed the suite of Aubigny were still at court, and bore their part in the pageant of Arthur and his Peers of the Round Table, whilst the prince attracted admiration by the uncommon skill which he exhibited, and the rich gifts he bestoAved ; but the profuse repetition of such expensive entertainments soon reduced him to great difficulties. The constant negotiation and intimacy between France and the Scottish court appear at this time to have roused the jealousy of Henry the Seventh. It required, indeed, no great acuteness in this cautious prince to anticipate the probable dissolution of the league of Cambrai, in which event he perhaps anti cipated a revival of the ancient enmity of France, and the possible hostility of James. His suspicion was indicated by the seizure of the Earl of Arran, and his brother Sir Patrick Hamilton, who had passed through England to the court of Lewis without the knowledge of Henry, and were now on their return. In Kent they were met by Vaughan, an emissary of England ;"], [55, "JAMES IV. 1 509. 49 and, on their refusal to take an oath which bound them to the observation of peace with that country, they were detained and committed to custody. To explain and justify his conduct, Henry despatched Dr West on a mission to the king, who resented the imprison ment of his subjects, and declared that they had only fulfilled their duty in refusing the oath. He declined a proposal made for a personal interview Avith his royal father-in-law; insisted on the liberation of Arran ; and on these conditions agreed to delay, for the present, any renewal of the league with France. The imprisoned nobles, however, were not immediately dismissed ; and, probably in consequence of the delay, James considered himself relieved from his promise. The death of the English king occurred not long after, an event which was unquestionably unfortunate for Scotland. His caution, command of temper, and earnest desire of peace, were excellent checks to the inconsiderate impetuosity of his son-in-laAV ; nor, if we except, perhaps, the last-mentioned circumstance of the detention of Arran, can he be accused of a single act of injustice towards that kingdom, so long the enemy of England. The accession of Henry the Eighth, on the other hand, although not productive of any immediate ill effects, drew after it, within no very distant period, a train of events injurious in their progress, and most calamitous in their issue. At first, indeed, all looked propitious and peaceful. The Scottish king sent his ambassador to congratulate his brother-in-laAV of England on his accession to the throne ; 1 and the youthful monarch, in the plenitude of his joy on this occasion, professed the most anxious Avishes for the continuance of that amity betAveen the 1 Rotuli Scoti\u00e6, vol. ii. p. 572.

The existing treaties were confirmed, and the two sovereigns interchanged their oaths for their observance ; J nor, although so nearly allied to Spain by his marriage, did Henry seem at first to share in the jealousy of France which was entertained by that power; on the contrary, even after the battle of Agnadillo had extinguished the hopes of the Venetians, he did not hesitate to conclude a treaty of alliance with Lewis the Twelfth. All these fair prospects of peace, however, were soon destined to be overclouded by the pride and impetuosity of a temper which hurried him into unjust and unprofitable AA7ars. In the meantime, Scotland, under the energetic government of James, continued to increase in Avealth and consequence : her navy, that great arm of national strength, had become not only respectable, but poAver ful: no method of encouragement had been neglected by the king ; and the success of his efforts was shown by the fact, that one of the largest ships of war then known in the world was constructed and launched Avithin his dominions. This vessel, which was named the Great Michael, appears to have been many years in building, and the king personally superintended the work Avith much perseverance and enthusiasm.2 The 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xiii. pp. 261, 262. 3 \" Her length was two hundred and forty feet, her breadth fifty-six to the water's edge, but only thirty-six within ; her sides, which were ten feet in thickness, were proof against shot. In these days ships carried guns only on the upper deck, and the Great Michael, notwith standing these gigantic dimensions, could boast of no more than thirty five ; sixteen on each side, two in the stern, and one in the bow. She was provided, however, with three hundred small artillery, under the names of myaud, culverins, and double dogs ; whilst her complement was three hundred seamen, besides officers, a hundred and twenty gunners, and a thousand soldiers.\" M'Pherson's Annals of Commerce, vol. ii. p. 42.

JAMES IV. 51 family of the Bartons, which for two generations had been prolific of naval commanders, were intrusted by this monarch with the principal authority in all mari time and commercial matters : they purchased vessels for him on the continent; they invited into his kingdom the most skilful foreign shipwrights ; they sold some of their own ships to the king, and vindicated the honour of their flag, Avhenever it was insulted, with a readiness and severity of retaliation Avhich inspired respect and terror. The Hollanders had attacked a small fleet of Scottish merchantmen, plundering the cargoes, mur dering the crews, and throAving the bodies into the sea. The affair was probably piratical, for it was folloAved by no diplomatic remonstrance ; but an exemplary vengeance followed the offence. AndreAV Barton was instantly despatched with a squadron, which captured many of the pirates ; and, in the cruel spirit of the times, the admiral commanded the hogsheads which were stowed in the hold of his vessels to be filled with the heads of the prisoners, and sent as a present to his royal master.1 So far back as 1476, in consequence of the Bartons having been plundered by a Portuguese squadron, let ters of reprisal were granted them, under the protec tion of Avhich there seems reason to believe that they more than indemnified themselves for their losses. The Portuguese, whose navy and commerce Avere at this time the richest and most powerful in the world, retaliated ; and, in 1507, the Lion, commanded by John Barton, was seized at Campvere, in Zealand, and its commander throAvn into prison. The sons of this officer, hoAvever, having procured from James a renewal of their letters of reprisal, fitted out a squadron, Avhich intercepted and captured at A'arious 1 Lesley's History, Bannatyne edit. p. 74."], [58, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1509. 52 times many richly-laden carracks returning from the Portuguese settlements in India and Africa ; and the umvonted apparition of blackamoors at the Scottish court, and sable empresses presiding over the royal tournaments, is to be traced to the spirit and success of the Scottish privateers. The consequence of this earnest attention to his fleet, was the securing an unusual degree of tran quillity at home. The islanders were kept down by a few ships of war more effectually than by an army ; and James acquired at the same time an increasing authority amongst his continental allies. By his navy he had been able to give assistance, on more than one occasion, to his relative the King of Denmark ; and Avhile the navy of England Avas still in its infancy, that of the sister country had risen, under the judicious care of the monarch, to a respectable rank, although far inferior to the armaments of the leading navigators of Europe \u2014 the Spaniards, the Portuguese, and the Venetians. It was at this period that the memorable invention of printing, \u2014 that art which, perhaps, more than any other human discovery, has changed the condition and the destinies of the world, \u2014 found its way into Scotland, under the auspices of Walter Chepman, a servant of the king's household.1 Two years before, the skill and ingenuity of Chepman appear to have attracted the notice of his royal master ; and as James was a friend to letters, and an enthusiast in every new invention, Ave may believe that he could not view this astonishing art with indifference. We knoAV that he purchased books from the typographer ; and that a royal patent to exercise his mystery was granted to 1 He printed in the year 1508 a small volume of pamphlets, and soon after, the \" Breviary of Aberdeen,\""], [59, "1509. JAMES IV. 53 the artist, the original of which still exists amongst our national records. The art, as is well known, had been imported into England by Caxton as early as the year 1474 ; yet more than thirty years elapsed before it penetrated into Scotland, a tardiness to be partly accounted for by the strong principle of con cealment and monopoly. Amidst all these useful cares, the character of the monarch, which could no longer plead for its excuse the levity or thoughtlessness of youth, exhibited many inconsistencies. He loved his youthful queen Avith much apparent tenderness, yet he was unable to renounce that indiscriminate admiration of beauty, and deArotion to pleasure, which, in defiance of public decency and moral restraint, sought its gratification equally amongst the highest and lowest ranks of society. He loved his people, and would, in the ardent generosity of his disposition, have suffered any personal privation to have saved the meanest of his subjects from distress ; but his thoughtless prodigality to every species of empiric, to jesters, dancers, and the lowest retainers about his court, with his devotion to gambling, impoverished his exchequer, and drove him, in his distresses, to expedients Avhich his better reason lamented and abandoned. Large sums of money also were expended in the idle pursuits of alchemy, and the equally vain and expensive endeavours for the discovery of gold mines in Scotland : often, too, in the midst of his labours, his pleasures, and his fantastic projects, the monarch Avas suddenly seized Avith a fit of ascetic penitence, at which times he Avould shut himself up for many days Avith his confessor, resolve on an expedition to Jerusalem, or take a solitary pil grimage on foot to some favourite shrine, where he Avept over his sins, and made resolutions of amend-"], [60, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1511. 54 ment, which, on his return to the world, were instantly forgotten. Yet all this contradiction and thoughtless ness of mind was accompanied by so much kindliness, accessibility, and warm and generous feeling, that the people forgot or pardoned it in a prince, who, on every occasion, showed himself their friend. It was now two years since the accession of Henry the Eighth to the crown ; and the aspect of affairs in England began to be alarming. The youthful ambi tion of the English king had become dazzled with the idle vision of the conquest of France ; he already pondered on the dangerous project of imitating the career of Edward the Third and Henry the Fifth ; Avhilst such was the affection of James for his ally, that any enterprise for the subjugation of that king dom Avas almost certain to draAV after it a declaration of Avar against the aggressor. Nor Avere there want ing artful and insidious friends, Avho, to accomplish their own ends, endeavoured to direct the arms of Henry against Lewis. Pope Julius the Second and Ferdinand of Spain having gained the object they had in view by the league of Cambrai, had seceded from that coalition, and were now anxious to check the successes of the French in Italy. The pontiff, with the violence which belonged to his character, left no measure unattempted to raise a powerful opposition against a monarch whose arms, under Gaston de Foix and the Chevalier Bayard, Avere every where trium phant ; and well aware that an invasion of France by Henry must operate as an immediate diversion, he exhausted all his policy to effect it : he at the same time succeeded in detaching the emperor and the Swiss from the league ; and the result of these efforts was a coalition as formidable in every respect as that which had been arrayed so lately against the"], [61, "1511. JAMES IV. 55 Venetians. Julius, who scrupled not to command his army in person, Ferdinand of Spain, Henry the Eighth, and the Swiss republics, determined to employ their Avhole strength in the expulsion of the French from the Italian states; and LeAvis, aware of the ruin which might follow any attempt to divide the forces of his kingdom, found himself under the necessity of recalling his troops, and abandoning the possessions which had cost him so many battles. These transactions were not seen by James without emotion. Since the commencement of his reign, his alliance Avith France had been cordial and sincere. A lucrative commercial intercourse, and the most friendly ties between the sovereigns and the nobility of the two countries, had produced a mutual warmth of national attachment : the armies of France had repeatedly been commanded by Scotsmen ; and throughout the long course of her history, whenever Scotland had been menaced or attacked by England, she had calculated without disappointment upon the assistance of her ally. As to the wisdom of this policy upon the part of her sovereigns, it would noAV be idle to inquire ; it being too apparent that, except where her independence as a nation Avas threatened, that kingdom had every thing to lose and nothing to gain by a war with the sister country. But these were not the days in Avhich the folly of a war of territorial conquest was recognized by European monarchs ; and the gallantry of the Scottish prince disposed him to enter with readiness into the quarrel of Lewis. We find him accordingly engaged in the most friendly correspondence with this sove reign, requesting permission, OAving to the failure of the harvest, to import grain from France, and renewing his determination to maintain, in the strictest manner, the ties of amity and support."], [62, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1511. 56 At this crisis an event happened which contributed in no small degree to fan the gathering flame of ani mosity against England. Protected by their letters of reprisal, and preserving, as it Avould appear, a here ditary animosity against the Portuguese, the Bartons had fitted out some privateers Avhich scoured the Western Ocean, took many prizes, and detained and searched the English merchantmen under the pretence that they had Portuguese goods on board. It is well known, that at this period, and even so late as the days of Drake and Cavendish, the line betAveen piracy and legitimate warfare was not precisely defined ; and there is reason to suspect that the Scottish merchants having found the vindication of their own Avrongs and the nation's honour a profitable speculation, were dis posed to push their retaliation to an extent so far beyond the individual losses they had suffered, that their hostilities became almost piratical. So, at least, it appeared to the English : and it is said that the Earl of Surrey, on hearing of some late excesses of the pmateers, declared that \" the narrow seas should not be so infested Avhilst he had an estate that could fur nish a ship, or a son Avho was able to command it.\" He accordingly fitted out tAvo men-of-Avar, Avhich he intrusted to his sons Lord Thomas Howard and Sir EdAATard HoAvard afterAvards lord high-admiral; and this officer having put to sea, had the fortune to fall in with Andrew Barton, in the Doaviis, as he Avas re turning from a cruise on the coast of Portugal. The engagement which folloAved was obstinately contested : Barton commanded his own ship, the Lion ; his other vessel was only an armed pinnace : but both fought Avith determined valour till the Scottish admiral Avas desperately Avounded : it is said, that even then this bold and experienced seaman continued to encourage"], [63, "1511. JAMES IV. 57 his men Avith his whistle,1 till receiving a cannon shot in the body, it dropped from his hand, and he fell dead upon the deck. His ships were then boarded, and carried into the Thames ; the crews, after a short imprisonment, being dismissed, but the vessels detained as lawful prizes. It was not to be expected that James should tamely brook this loss sustained by his navy, and the insult offered to his flag in a season of peace. Barton was a personal favourite, and one of his ablest officers ; whilst the Lion, the vessel which had been taken, was only inferior in size to the \" Great Harry,\" at that time the largest ship of war which belonged to England. Rothesay herald was accordingly despatched on the instant, Avith a remon strance and a demand for redress ; but the king had now no longer to negotiate Avith the cautious and pacific Henry the Seventh, and his impetuous succes sor returned no gentler answer than that the fate of pirates ought never to be a matter of dispute among princes. It happened unfortunately that at this moment another cause of irritation existed : Sir Robert Ker, an officer of James's household, master of his artillery, and warden of the middle marches, having excited the animosity of the borderers by AArhat they deemed an excessive rigour, was attacked and slain by three Englishmen named Lilburn, Starhead, and Heron.2 This happened in the time of Henry the Seventh, by whom Lilburn Avas delivered to the Scots, whilst Star head and Heron made their escape ; but such was the 1 Lesley, Bannatyne edition, pp. 82, 83.

After some years Lilburn died in prison, whilst Starhead and his accomplice stole forth from their concealment ; and trusting that all Avould be forgotten under the acces sion of a new monarch, began to walk more openly abroad. But Andrew Ker, the son of Sir Robert, was not thus to be cheated of his revenge : two of his vas sals sought out Starhead's residence during the night, although it was ninety miles from the border, and, breaking into the house, murdered him in cold blood ; after AAdiich they sent his head to their master, who exposed it with all the ferocity of feudal exultation, in the most conspicuous part of the capital ; a proceeding Avhich appears to have been unchecked by James, whilst its summary and violent nature could hardly fail to excite the indignation of Henry. There were other sources of animosity in the assistance which the Eng lish monarch had afforded to the Duchess of Savoy against the Duke of Gueldres, the relative and ally of his brother-in-law, in the audacity Avith which his cruisers had attacked and plundered a French vessel Avhich ran in for protection to an anchorage off the coast of Ayr, and the manifest injustice with Avhich he refused to deliver to his sister, the Queen of Scot land, a valuable legacy of jewels which had been left her by her father's will. Such being the state of affairs betAveen the two countries, an envoy appeared at the Scottish court with letters from the pope, whilst nearly about the same time arrived the ambassadors of England, France, and Spain. Henry, flattered by the adulation of Julius, who greeted him with the title of head of the Italian league, had noAV openly declared war against France ;"], [65, "1512. JAMES IV. 59 and anxious to be safe on the side of Scotland, he condescended to express his regret, and to offer satis faction for any violations of the peace. But James detected the object of this tardy proposal, and refused to accede to it. To the message of the king of France, he listened with affectionate deference, deprecated the injustice of the league which had been formed against him, and spoke Avith indignation of the conduct of England, regretting only the schism betAveen Lewis and the see of Rome, which he declared himself anxious by every means to remove. Nor Avere these mere words of good will : he despatched his uncle, the Duke of Albany, as ambassador to the emperor, to entreat him to act as a mediator betAveen the pope and the King of France ; Avhilst the Bishop of Moray proceeded on the same errand to that country,1 and afterwards endeavoured to instil pacific feelings into the College of Cardinals, and the Marquis of Mantua. To the proposals of the ambassador of Ferdinand, who laboured to engage him in the papal league against Lewis, it was answered by the king, that his only de sire was, to maintain the peace of Christendom ; and so earnest were his endeavours upon this subject, that he advised the summoning of a general council for the purpose of deliberating upon the likeliest methods of carrying his wishes into effect. To secure the co operation of Denmark, Sir Andrew Brownhill Avas deputed to that court ; and letters which strongly recommended the healing of all divisions, and the duty of forgiveness, Avere addressed to the Avarlike Julius. It was too late, hoAvever : hostilities between France and the papal confederates had begun ; and James, aAvare that his OAvn kingdom Avould soon be inA'olved 1 Epistol\u00e6 Reg. Scot. vol. i. p. 126-128."], [66, "1512. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 60 iii Avar, made every effort to meet the emergency with vigour. His levies Avere conducted on a great scale ; and we learn from the contemporary letter of the English envoy then in Scotland, that the country rung Avith the din of preparation : armed musters were held in every part of the kingdom, not excepting the Isles, iioav an integral portion of the state : ships were launched ; forests felled to complete those on the stocks : Borthwick, the master gunner, was employed in casting cannon ; Urnebrig, a German, in the ma nufacture of gunpoAvder : the Great Michael Avas victualled and cleared out for sea: the castles in the interior dismantled of their guns, that they might be used in the fleet or the army ; and the ablest sea officers and mariners collected in the various sea ports.1 In the midst of these preparations the king visited every quarter in person ; mingled with his sailors and artisans, and took so constant an interest in every thing connected with his fleet, that it began to be rumoured he meant to command it in person. Yet Avhilst such was the hostile activity exhibited through out the country, negotiations Avith England Avere con tinued, and both monarchs made mutual professions of their desire to maintain peace ; Henry in all proba bility with insincerity, and James certainly only to gain time. It was at this time that the Scottish queen gave birth to a prince in the palace of Linlithgow, on the 10th of April, 1512, who aftenvards succeeded to the throne by the title of James the Fifth.2 Early in the year 1512, Lord Dacre and Dr West arrived as ambassadors from England, and were re ceived with a studied courtesy, which seemed only intended to blind them to the real designs of Scotland. 1 Treasurer's Accounts, 1511, 1512. - Lesley, p. 84."], [67, "1512. JAMES IV. 61 Their object was to prevail on the king to renew his oath regarding the peace with England ; to prevent the sailing of the fleet to the assistance of the French; and to offer, upon the part of their master, his oath for the observation of an inviolable amity with his brother.1 But the efforts of the English diplomatists were successfully counteracted by the abilities of the French ambassador, De la Motte : they departed with splendid presents, indeed, for the king delighted in showing his generosity even to his enemies, but with out any satisfactory ansAver; and James, instead of listening to Henry, reneAved the league with France, consenting to the insertion of a clause which, in a spirit of foolish and romantic devotion, bound himself and his subjects to that kingdom by stricter ties than before.2 About the same time an abortive attempt by the Scots to make themselves masters of Berwick, and an attack of a fleet of English merchantmen by De la Motte, who sunk three, and carried seven in triumph into Leith, must be considered equivalent to a declara tion of war. Barton, too, Falconer, Mathison, and other veteran sea officers, received orders to be on the look-out for English ships ; and aware of the impor tance of a diversion on the side of Ireland, a league was entered into with O'Donnel, prince of Connal, who visited the Scottish court, and took the oath of homage to James : Duncan Campbell, one of the High land chiefs, engaged at the same time to procure some Irish vessels to join the royal fleet, which, it was now reckoned, would amount to sixteen ships of Avar, besides smaller craft ; a formidable armament for that period, and likely, when united to the squadron of the King of France, to proATe, if skilfully commanded, an 1 Lesley, p. 85. 3 MS.

Yet James's preparations, with his other sources of profusion, had so completely impoverished his exchequer, that it became a question whether he Avould be able to main tain the force which he had fitted out. In a private message sent to Lord Dacre, the treasurer of Scotland appears to have stated, that a present from Henry of five thousand angels, and the payment of the disputed legacy, which with much injustice was still withheld, might produce a revolution in his policy -f and it is certain that, on the arrival of letters from Lewis, instigating Scotland to declare war, the reply of the monarch pleaded the impossibility of obeying the injunction unless a large annuity was remitted by France. The borderers, however, of both countries had already commenced hostilities ; and Robert Bar ton, acting under his letters of reprisal, and scouring the narrow seas, came into Leith, after a successful cruise, with thirteen English prizes.2 In their mutual professions of a desire for peace both governments appear to have been insincere : Henry had determined to signalize his arms by the reconquest of Guienne, and only wished to gain time for the em barkation of his army ; James, shutting his eyes to the real interests of his kingdom, allowed a devotion to Lewis, and a too violent resentment for the insult offered to his fleet, to direct his policy. To concen trate his strength, however, required delay. Repeated messages passed betAveen the two courts ; the Scottish prince, by his ambassador, Lord Drummond, even pro ceeded so far as to offer to Henry a gratuitous remis- 1 Letter, Lord Dacre to the Bishop of Durham, 17th of August.

He found the king engrossed in warlike preparations, yet visited for the moment by one of his temporary fits of penance, in which he projected an expedition to Jerusalem, animated equally by a romantic desire of signalizing his prowess against the infidels, and a hope of expiating the guilt which he had incurred in appearing in arms against his father. He had been shut up for a week in the church of the Friars Observants at Stirling ; but the effect of this religious retirement seems to have been the reverse of pacific. He expressed himself with the utmost bitter ness against the late warlike pontiff, Julius the Second, then recently deceased ; declaring that, had he lived, he would have supported a council even of three bishops against him. He had resolved to send Forman the Bishop of Moray, and the chief author of the war against England, as ambassador to Leo the Tenth, the new pope ; and it was reported that LeAvis had secured the services of this able and crafty prelate by the pro mise of a cardinal's hat. To Henry's offers of redress for the infractions of the truce, provided the Scottish monarch Avould remain inactive during the campaign against France, he replied that he Avould not proceed to open hostilities against England, without previously sending a declaration by a herald ; so that if the king fulfilled his intention of passing into France with his army, ample time should be allowed him to return for the defence of his kingdom. It was unequivocally 1 Rymer, F\u0153dera, vol. xiii. pp. 347, 348."], [70, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1513. intimated that peace with France was the only condi tion upon which an amicable correspondence could be maintained betAveen the two kingdoms ; and amongst minor subjects of complaint, Henry's continued refusal to send his sister's jewels was exposed in a spirited letter from that princess, Avhich was delivered by Dr West on his return.1 La Motte soon after again arrived from France with a small squadron laden with provisions for the Scottish fleet, besides warlike stores and rich presents to the king and his principal nobles. About the same time the King of Denmark sent several ships into Scotland, freighted with arms, harness, and ammunition ; and O'Donnel, the Irish potentate, visited the court in per- son, to renew his offers of assistance against England. But an artful proceeding of Anne of Brittany, the consort of Lewis, had, it Avas believed, a greater effect in accelerating the war than either the intrigues of the Bishop of Moray or the negotiations of La Motte. This princess, who understood the romantic weakness of the Scottish king, addressed to him an epistle con- ceived in a strain of high-floAvn and amorous complaint. She described herself as an unhappy damsel, surround- ed by danger, claimed his protection from the attacks of a treacherous monarch, and sent him, not only a present of fourteen thousand crowns, but the still more tender gift of a ring from her own finger \u2014 a token to her faithful knight, upon whose ready aid she implicitly relied. She concluded her letter by imploring him to advance, Avere it but three steps, into English ground, for the sake of his mistress, as she had already suffered much misconstruction in defence of his honour, and 1 West to Henry, 1st April.

The fleet which assembled evinces that the efforts of the king to create a navy had been eminently suc cessful. It consisted of thirteen great ships, all of them, in the naval phraseology of the times, Avith three tops, besides ten smaller vessels, and a ship of Lynne lately captured. In addition to these there was the Great Michael, Avith a thirty-oared galley AA'hich be longed to her, and two ships, the Margaret and the James, AAThich, although damaged in a late gale, were now repaired and ready to put to sea. Aboard this fleet Avas embarked a force of three thousand men, under the command of the Earl of Arran, a nobleman of limited experience in the art of Avar : one of the principal captains of the fleet was Gordon of Letter fury,2 a son of the Earl of Huntley ; but, unfortunately, Arran's higher feudal rank and his title of Generalis simo included au authority over the fleet as well as the army, and this circumstance drew after it disas trous consequences. Why James should not have appointed some of his veteran sea officers, Barton, Wood, or Falconer, to conduct a navy of Avhich he 1 Lindsay, p. 171. Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 87. ' Lesley, p. 87. VOL. IV.

Instead of obeying the orders which he had received from the king, who, with the object of encouraging his seamen, embarked in the Great Michael and re mained on board for some time, Arran conducted the fleet to Carrickfergus, in Ireland, landed his troops, and stormed the town Avith much barbarity, sparing neither age nor sex. J The reckless brutality with which the city was given up to the unlicensed fury of the soldiery would at all times have been blameable, but at this moment it was committed during a time of peace, and against the express promise of the king ; yet such was the folly or simplicity of the perpetrator, that Avith the spirit of a successful freebooter, he did not hesitate to put his ships about and return to Ayr with his plunder. Incensed to the utmost by such conduct, and dreading that his delay might totally frustrate the object of the expedition, James despatched Sir Andrew Wood, to supersede Arran in the com mand ; but misfortune still pursued his measures, and before this experienced seaman could reach the coast, the fleet had again sailed. Over the future history of an armament which was the boast of the sovereign, and whose equipment had cost the country an immense sum for those times, there rests a deep obscurity. That it reached France is certain, and it is equally clear that only a few ships ever returned to Scotland.

The war, indeed, betAveen Henry and Lewis Avas so soon concluded that little time was given for naval enter prise ; and the solitary engagement by which it was distinguished, (the battle of Spurs,) appears to have been fought before the Scottish forces could join the French army. With regard to the final fate of the squadron, the probability seems to be, that, after the defeat at Flodden, part, including the great Michael, were purchased by the French government ; part arrived in a shattered and disabled state in Scotland ; Avhilst others, which had been fitted out by merchant adventurers, and were only commissioned by the government, pursued their private courses, and are lost sight of in the public transactions of the times. But we must turn from these unsatisfying conjectures to the important and still more disastrous events which were passing in Scotland. Although the war was condemned by the wisest heads amongst his council, and the people, with the exception of the borderers, whose trade was plunder, deprecated the interruption of their pacific labours, so great Avas the popularity of the king, that from one end of the country to the other, his summons for the muster of his army was devotedly obeyed. The low land counties collected in great strength ; and from the Highlands and the remotest isles, the hardy inhabi tants hastened under their several chiefs to join the royal banner. The Earl of Argyle, Mac-Ian of Ardna murchan, Maclean of DoAvart,and Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenurcha, with many other barons, led their clans men and vassals to support the quarrel of their sove reign ; and within a short period James saw himself at the head of an army, Avhich at the lowest computation Avas a hundred thousand strong."], [74, "1513.

It dwelt with some exaggeration upon the repeated injuries and insults which James had received from his brother-in-law. It accused him of refusing a safe-conduct to his am bassador (a proceeding Avorthyonly of an infidel power;) it upbraided him Avith a want of common justice and affection in withholding from his sister, the Queen of Scotland, the jewels and the legacy Avhich had been left her by her father ; 1 it asserted that the conduct of England, in a late meeting of the commissioners of the two countries on the borders, had been deficient in honour and good faith ; that Heron, the murderer of a Scottish baron who was dear to the king, was pro tected in that country ; that Scottish subjects in time of peace had been carried off in fetters across the border ; that Andrew Barton had been slaughtered and his ships unjustly captured by Henry's admiral ; Avhilst that prince not only refused all redress, but showed the contempt Avith Avhich he treated the demand bj declaring war against James's relative, the Duke of Gueldres, and noAV invading the dominions of his friend and ally the King of France.

It was, indeed, high time to accelerate his levies, for Home the lord-chamberlain, at the head of a force of eight thousand men, had already burst across the English border, and after laying waste the country, was returning home with his booty. A long interval of peace, however, had been followed, as usual, by a decay of military skill amongst the Scots. The cham berlain, neglecting his discipline, forgot to push on his piquets, but marching in a confused mass, embarrassed by the cattle which he drove before him, and thought less of an enemy, was surprised and defeated with great slaughter at a pass called the Broomhouse, by Sir William Bulmer. The action was, as usual, decided by the English archers, who, concealing them selves in the tall furze with which the place abounded, struck doAvn the Scottish companies by an unexpected discharge of their arrows.1 This being often repeated, the confusion of their ranks became irrecoverable, and the English horse breaking in upon them gained an easy victory. Five hundred were slain upon the spot, and their leader compelled to fly for his life, leaving his banner on the field, and his brother Sir George Home, with four hundred men, prisoners in the hands of the English. The remainder, consisting of borderers more solicitous for the preservation of their booty than their honour, dispersed upon the first alarm, and the whole affair was far from creditable to the Scots. So much was the king incensed and mortified by the result of this action, that his mind, already resolved on war, became impatient to Avipe out the stain inflicted on the national honour, and he determined instantly to lead his army in person against England. This was a fatal resolve, and appeared full of rash- 1 Holinshed, edit. 1808, p. 471. Hall, p. 556."], [77, "1513.

The queen earnestly besought him to spare her the unnatural spectacle of seeing her husband arrayed in mortal con test against her brother ; and Avhen open remonstrance produced no effect, other methods Avere employed to work upon the superstition Avhich formed so marked a feature in the royal mind. At Linlithgow, a few days before he set out for his army, Avhilst attending vespers in the church of St Michael, adjacent to his palace, a venerable stranger of a stately appearance entered the aisle Avhere the king knelt ; his head was uncovered, his hair, parted over his forehead, floAved down his shoulders, his robe was blue, tied round his loins with a linen girdle, and there Avas an air of majesty about him, which inspired the beholders with awe. Nor was this feeling decreased AA'hen the unknown visitant walked up to the king, and, leaning over the reading desk Avhere he knelt, thus addressed him : \" Sir, I am sent to warn thee not to proceed in thy present under taking; for if thou dost, it shall not fare Avell either with thyself or those Avho go Avith thee. Further, it hath been enjoined me to bid thee shun the familiar society and counsels of women, lest they occasion thy disgrace and destruction.\" The boldness of these words, which were pronounced audibly, seemed to excite the indignation neither of the king nor those around him. All were struck Avith superstitious dread, Avhilst the figure, using neither salutation nor reverence, retreated and vanished amongst the croAvd. Whither he went, or hoAV he disappeared, no one, Avhen the first feelings of astonishment had subsided, could tell ; and although the strictest inquiry Avas made, all remained a mystery.

On arriving at head-quarters, James was flattered Avith the evidence he had before him of the affectionate loyalty of his subjects. The war was unpopular with the nobles; yet such was the strength with which the loAvland counties had mustered, and the readiness with Avhich the remotest districts had sent their vassals, that he saw himself at the head of a noble army, ad mirably equipt, and furnished Avith a train of artillery superior to that which had been brought into the field by any former monarch of Scotland. Leaving his capital, and apparently Avithout having formed any definite plan of operations, the monarch entered England on the 22d of August ; encamping that night on the banks of the river Till, a tributary stream to the TAveed.2 Here he seems to have re mained inactive for two days ; and, on the 24th, with the view of encouraging his army, he passed an act, that the heirs of all Avho fell in the present campaign, should not be subject to the common feudal fines, but should be free from the burdens of \" ward, relief, or marriage,\" Avithout regard to age.3 The proclamation is dated at Twiselhaugh, and from this place he moA'ed down the side of the TAveed, and invested the castle of Norham, which surrendered after a siege of a week. 1 Buchanan, xiii. 31.

At Ford, which Avas stormed and razed,1 Lady Heron, a beauti ful and artful Avoman, the wife of Sir William Heron, who was still a prisoner in Scotland, became James's captive ; and the king, ever the slave of beauty, is said to have resigned himself to her influence, which she employed to retard his military operations. Time was thus given for the English army to assemble. Had Douglas or Randolph commanded the host, they would have scoured and laid waste the Avhole of the north of England within the period that the monarch had al ready wasted ; but James's military experience did not go beyond the accomplishments of a tournament ; and although aware that his army was encamped in a barren country, where they must soon become dis tressed, he idled away his days, till the opportunity was past. Whilst such was the course pursued by the king, the Earl of Surrey, concentrating the strength of the northern counties, soon raised an army of tAventy-six thousand men; and marching through Durham, re ceived there the sacred banner of St Cuthbert.

It re proached him with having broken his faith and league, which had been solemnly pledged to the King of England, in thus invading his dominions, and offered him battle on the succeeding Friday, if he would be content to remain so long in England and accept it. Lord Thomas Howard added a message, informing the king, that as high-admiral, and one who had borne a personal share in the action against Andrew Barton, he was now ready to justify the death of that pirate, for which purpose he would lead the vanguard, where his enemies, from Avhom he expected as little mercy as he meant to grant them, Avould be sure to find him. To this challenge, James instantly replied, that \" he desired nothing more earnestly than the encounter, and would abide the battle on the day appointed.\" As to the accusation of broken honour, Avhich had been brought against him, he desired his herald to carry a broad denial of the statement. \" Our bond and promise,\" he observed, \" was to remain true to our royal brother, so long as he maintained his faith with us. This he was the first to break; we have desired redress, and have been denied it ; we have warned him of our intended hostility, a courtesy Avhich he has refused to us ; and this is our just quarrel, which, with the grace of God, we shall de fend.\" These mutual messages passed on the 4th of September ; and on the day appointed, Surrey ad vanced against the enemy.

JAMES IV. 75 the obstinacy of the king in wasting upon his plea sures, and his observation of the punctilios of chivalry, the hours which might have been spent in active war fare, had created dissatisfaction in the soldiers, many of whom deserted with the booty they had already collected, so that in a short time the army was much diminished in numbers. To accept the challenge of his adversary, and permit him to appoint a day for the encounter, was contrary to the advice of his best counsellors ; and he might have recollected, that in circumstances almost similar, tAvo great masters in war, Douglas and Randolph, had treated a parallel proposal of Edward the Third with a sarcastic refusal. He had the sagacity, hoAvever, to change his first encampment for a stronger position on the hill of Flodden, one of the last and loAvest eminences which detach themselves from the range of the Cheviots ; a ground skilfully chosen, inaccessible on both flanks, and defended in front by the river Till, a deep sluggish stream, which wound betAveen the armies. On advancing and reconnoitering the spot, Surrey, who despaired of being able to attack the Scots with out exposing himself to the probability of defeat, again sent a herald, to request the king to descend from the eminence into the plain. He complained somewhat unreasonably, that James had \" putte himself into a ground more like a fortress or a camp, than any in different field for battle to be taxed ;\" x and hoping to work on the chivalrous spirit of the monarch, hinted that \" such conduct did not sound to his honour ;\" but James Avould not even admit the messenger into his presence.

He had chosen an impregnable position, had fulfilled his agreement by abiding the attack of the enemy ; and such Avas the distress of Surrey's army in a wasted country, that to keep it longer together was impos sible. He attempted, therefore, a decisive measure, which would have appeared desperate unless he had reckoned upon the carelessness and inexperience of his opponent. Passing the Till on the 8th of Sep tember, he proceeded along some rugged grounds on its east side, to Barmoor Avood, about tAvo miles dis tant from the Scottish position, Avhere he encamped for the night. His march Avas concealed from the enemy by an eminence on the east of Ford ; but that the man\u0153uvre was executed without observation or interruption, evinced a shameful negligence in the Scottish commanders. Early on the morning of the 9th, he marched from Barmoor Avood in a north westerly direction ; and then turning suddenly to the eastAvard, crossed the Till with his vanguard and artillery, which was commanded by Lord Howard, at Twisel bridge, not far from the confluence of the Till and the Tweed ; Avhilst the rear division, under Surrey in person, passed the river at a ford about a mile higher up. Whilst these movements were taking place, with a sloAvness Avhich afforded ample opportunity for a suc cessful attack, the Scottish king remained unaccount ably passive. His veteran officers remonstrated. They showed him, that if he advanced against Surrey, when the enemy Avere defiling over the bridge with their vanguard separated from the rear, there AATas every chance of destroying them in detail, and gaining an easy victory. The Earl of Angus, whose age and ex perience gave great weight to his advice, implored"], [83, "1513. JAMES IV. 77 him either to assault the English, or to change his position by a retreat, ere it was too late; but his prudent counsel was only received by a cruel taunt, \u2014 \" Angus,\" said the king, \" if you are afraid, you may go home ;\" a reproach which the spirit of the old baron could not brook. Bursting into tears, he turned mournfully aAATay, observing, that his former life might have spared him such a rebuke from the lips of his sovereign. \" My age,\" said he, \" renders my body of no service, and my counsel is despised ; but I leave my two sons and the vassals of Douglas in the field : may the result be glorious, and Angus's foreboding unfounded !\" The army of Surrey was still marching across the bridge, Avhen Borthwick, the master of the artillery, fell on his knees before the king, and ear nestly solicited permission to bring his guns to bear upon the columns, which might be then done with the most destructive effect ; but James commanded him to desist on peril of his head, declaring, that he Avould meet his antagonist on equal terms in a plain field, and scorned to avail himself of such an advantage. The counsel of Huntley was equally ineffectual ; the remonstrance of Lord Lindsay of the Byres, a rough warrior, Avas received by James with such vehement indignation, that he threatened on his return to hang him up at his own gate. Time ran on amidst these useless altercations, and the opportunity Avas soon irrecoverable. The last divisions of Surrey's force had disentangled themselves from the narroAV bridge ; the rear had passed the ford ; and the earl, marshalling his army with the leisure Avhich his enemy alloAved him, placed his entire line betAveen James and his own country. He was thus enabled, by an easy and gradual ascent, which led to Flodden, to march upon the rear of the enemy ; and, Avithout losing his advan-"], [84, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1513. 78 tage for a moment, he advanced against them in full array, his army being divided into two battles, and each battle having two wings.1 On becoming aware of this, the king immediately set fire to the temporary huts and booths of his encampment, and descended the hill, with the object of occupying the eminence on which the village of Brankston is built. His army was divided into five battles, some of which had assumed the form of squares, some of wedges ; and all were drawn up in line, about a bowshot distance from each other.2 Their march was con ducted in complete silence ; and the clouds of smoke which arose from the burning camp, being driven in the face of the enemy, mutually concealed the armies ; so that when the breeze freshened, and the misty curtain was withdrawn, the two hosts discovered that they were within a quarter of a mile of each other. The arrangement of both armies was simple. The van of the English, which consisted of ten thousand men, divided into a centre and two wings, was led by Lord Thomas Howard ; the right wing being intrusted to his brother Sir Edmund, and the left to Sir Marma duke Constable. In the main centre of his host, Surrey himself commanded ; the charge of the rear was given to Sir Edward Stanley ; and a strong body of horse, under Lord Dacre, formed a reserve. Upon the part of the Scots, the Earls of Home and Huntley led the vanguard or advance; the king the centre, and the Earls of Lennox and Argyle the rear ; near which was the reserve, consisting of the flower of the Lothians, commanded by the Earl of Bothwell.

JAMES IV. 79 menced at four in the afternoon by a furious charge of Huntley and Home upon the portion of the English vanguard under Sir Edmund HoAvard ; which, after some resistance, was throAvn into confusion, and totally routed. Howard's banner was beaten down ; and he himself escaped with difficulty, falling back on his brother, the admiral's division. That commander, dreading the consequences of the defeat, instantly des patched a messenger to his father, Lord Surrey, entreating him to extend his line Avith all speed, and strengthen the van by drawing up a part of the centre on its left. The man\u0153uvre was judicious, but it would have required too long a time to execute it ; and at this critical moment, Lord Dacre galloped forward with his cavalry, to the support of the vanguard.1 Nothing could have been more timely than his assistance ; he not only checked the career of the Scottish earls, but, being seconded by the intrepid attack of the admiral, drove back the division of Huntley Avith great slaugh ter, whilst Home's men, who were chiefly borderers, imagining they had already gained the victory, began to disperse and pillage. Dacre and the admiral then turned their attack against another portion of the Scottish vanguard, led by the Earls of CraAvford and Montrose, who met them with levelled spears, and resolutely withstood the charge. Whilst such Avas the state of things on the right, a desperate contest was carried on betAveen James and the Earl of Surrey in the centre. In his ardour, however, the king forgot that the duties of a commander were distinct from the indiscriminate valour of a knight ; he placed himself in the front of his lances and billmen, surrounded by his nobles, who, Avhilst they pitied the gallant weakness 1 Letter of Lord Dacre, in Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 460."], [86, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1513. 80 of such conduct, disdained to leave their sovereign un supported.1 The first consequence of this was so furious a charge upon the English centre, that its ranks were broken ; and for a while the standard of the Earl of Surrey Avas in danger ; but by this time, Lord Dacre and the admiral had been successful in defeating the division led by Crawford and Montrose ; and Avheeling towards the left, they turned their whole strength against the flank of the Scottish centre, Avhich wavered under the shock, till the Earl of BotliAvell came up with the reserve, and restored the day in this quarter. On the right, the divisions led by the Earls of Lennox and Argyle Avere composed chiefly of the highlanders and islesmen ; the Campbells, Macleans, Macleods, and other hardy clans, who were dreadfully galled by the discharge of the English archers. Un able to reach the enemy with their broadswords and axes, which formed their only weapons, and at no time very amenable to discipline, their squadrons began to run fiercely forward, eager for closer fight and thought less of the fatal consequences of breaking their array.2 It was to little purpose that La Motte and the French officers who Avere with him attempted by entreaties and blows to restrain them ; they neither understood their language nor cared for their violence, but threw themselves SAVord in hand upon the English. They found, however, an enemy in Sir Edward Stanley, whose coolness was not to be surprised in this manner. The squares of English pikemen stood to their ground ; and although for a moment the shock of the moun taineers was terrible, its force once sustained became spent with its own violence, and nothing remained but a disorganization so complete that to recover their 1 Hall, p. 562. 3 Buchanan, xiii, 38."], [87, "JAMES IV. 1513. 81 ranks Avas impossible. The consequence was a total rout of the right wing of the Scots, accompanied by a dreadful slaughter, in which, amid other brave men, the Earls of Lennox and Argyle AArere slain. Yet, notwithstanding this defeat on the right, the centre under the king still maintained an obstinate and dubi ous conflict Avith the Earl of Surrey. The determined personal valour of James, imprudent as it Avas, had the effect of rousing to a pitch of desperate courage the meanest of the priArate soldiers, and the ground becom ing soft and slippery from blood, they pulled off their boots and shoes, and secured a firmer footing by fight ing in their hose. No quarter Avas given on either side ; and the combatants were disputing every inch of ground, when Stanley, without losing his time in pursuit of the highlanders, drew back his division and impetuously charged the rear of the Scottish centre. It Avas noAV late in the evening, and this movement was decisive. Pressed on the flank by Dacre and the admiral, opposed in front by Surrey, and now attacked in the rear by Stanley, the king's battle fought Avith fearful odds against it ; yet James continued by his voice and his gestures to animate his soldiers, and the contest was still uncertain Avhen he fell pierced with an arroAV, and mortally wounded in the head by a bill, within a few paces from the English earl, his antagonist. The death of their sovereign seemed only to animate the fury of the Scottish nobles, Avho threw themselves into a circle round the body and defended it till darkness separated the combatants. At this time Surrey Avas uncertain of the result of the battle ; the remains of the enemy's centre still held the field; Home with his borderers hovered on the left, and the commander wisely allowed neither pursuit nor plunder, but drew off his men and kept a strict watch VOL.

When the morning broke, the Scottish artillery were seen standing deserted on the side of the hill ; their defenders had disappeared, and the earl ordered thanks to be given for a victory which was no longer doubtful. He then created forty knights on the field, and permitted Lord Dacre to follow the retreat ; yet, even after all this, a body of the Scots appeared unbroken upon a hill, and were about to charge the lord admiral, when they were compelled to leave their position by a discharge of the English ord nance.1 The soldiers then ransacked the camp and seized the artillery AA'hich had been abandoned. It consisted of seventeen cannon of various shapes and dimensions, amongst which were six guns admirable for their fabric and beauty, named by the late monarch the Six Sisters, which Surrey boasted were longer and larger than any in the arsenal of the King of England. The loss of the Scots in this fatal battle amounted to about ten thousand men.2 Of these a great proportion were of high rank ; the remainder being composed of the gentry, the farmers, and landed yeomanry, who disdained to fly Avhen their sovereign and his nobles lay stretched in heaps around them.

The names of the gentry who fell are too numerous for recapitu lation, since there Avere few families of note in Scotland which did not lose one relative or another, whilst some houses had to weep the death of all. It is from this cause that the sensations of sorrow and national la mentation occasioned by the defeat were peculiarly poignant and lasting ; so that to this day few Scots men can hear the name of Flodden, without a shudder of gloomy regret.1 The body of James was found on the morrow amongst the thickest of the slain, and re cognized by Lord Dacre, although much disfigured by wounds. It was carried to Berwick and ultimately interred at Richmond.2 In Scotland, however, the affection of the people for their monarch led them to disbelieve the account of his death : it was well known that several of his nobles had worn in the battle a dress similar to the king's ; and to this we may probably trace a report that James had been seen alive after his defeat. Many long and fondly believed that, in completion of a religious vow, he had travelled to Jerusalem, and would return to claim the crown.3 The causes which led to this defeat are of easy de tection, and must be traced chiefly to the king himself. His obstinacy rendered him deaf to the advice of his 1 See Notes and Illustrations, letter A. s Weever's Funeral Monuments, p. 181. 3 Godwin in his Annals, p. 22, mentions, \" That when James's body was found, his neck was opened in the middle with a wide wound, his left hand, almost cut off in two places, did scarce hang to his arm, and the archers had shot him in many places of his body.\" The sword and dagger of the unfortunate monarch are to be seen at this day preserved in the College of Arms in London, and have been engraved by the late Mr Weber as a frontispiece to the battle of \"Flodden Field,\" an ancient poem published by that author."], [90, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1513. 84 officers, and his ignorance of war made his individual judgment the most dangerous guide. The days Avhich he wasted in the siege of Norham and Etal, or squan dered at Ford, gave his enemy time to concentrate his army, and when the hosts were in sight of each other, he committed another error in permitting Surrey to dictate to him the terms on which they Avere to engage. A third blunder was the neglect of attacking the Eng lish in crossing the river, and his obstinacy in not employing his artillery, which might have broken and destroyed the enemy in detail, and rendered their defeat when in confusion comparatively easy. Last of all, James's thoughtlessness in the battle was as conspicuous as his want of judgment before it. When Surrey, mindful of his duty, kept himself as much as possible out of the deadly brunt of the conflict, and was able to watch its progress and to give each division his prompt assistance, the Scottish monarch acted the part of Richard or Amadis, more solicitous for the display of his individual bravery and proAvess than anxious for the defeat of the enemy. It was a gallant but a fatal weakness, which cannot be sufficiently con demned ; dearly expiated, indeed, by the death of the unfortunate prince himself, whose fate, some may think, ought to defend him from such severity of censure ; but when Ave consider the flood of noble and of honest blood Avhich Avas poured out at Flodden, and the long train of national misfortunes which this disaster en tailed upon the country, it is right that the miseries of unnecessary Avarfare, and the folly of a thirst for individual glory, should be pointed out for the admoni tion of future ages. The character of this monarch may be sufficiently understood by the history which has been giATen of his reign ; and it is pleasing, in running over its most pro-"], [91, "JAMES IV. 1513. 85 minent features, to exchange censure for applause. His energy, firmness, and indefatigable activity in the ad ministration of justice ; his zeal for the encouragement of the useful arts ; his introduction of the machinery of law and justice into the northern districts and the domi nions of the Isles ; his encouragement of the commerce and the agriculture of the country ; his construction of a naval power ; his provision for increasing the means of national defence by casting artillery, building forts, and opening by his fleet a communication with the remotest parts of his kingdom, were all worthy of high praise ; whilst his kindness of heart, and accessibility to the lowest classes of his subjects, rendered him de servedly beloved. His weaknesses were, a too anxious desire for popularity, an extravagant love of amusement, and a criminal profusion of expenditure upon pleasures which diminished his respectability in the eyes of his subjects, and injured them by the contagion of bad example. He Avas slain in the forty-second year of his age, leaving an only son, an infant, who succeeded him by the title of James the Fifth.

Charles V. | The neAvs of the discomfiture of the Scottish army at Flodden spread through the land with a rapidity of terror and sorroAV proportionate to the greatness of the defeat, and the alarming condition into which it in stantly brought the country. The wail of private grief from the hall to the cottage, was loud and universal. In the capital were to be heard the shrieks of women, who ran distractedly through the streets bewailing the husbands, the sons, or the brothers, who had fallen, clasping their infants to their bosoms, and anticipating in tears the coming desolation of their country. In the provinces, as the gloomy tidings rolled on, the same scenes were repeated ; and had Surrey been inclined, or in a condition to pursue his victory, the consequences of the universal panic were much to be dreaded ; but the very imminency of the public danger was salutary in checking this violent outburst of sorroAV in the capi tal. During the absence of the chief magistrates, Avho had joined the army Avith the king, the merchants to AA'hom their authority had been deputed, exhibited a"], [93, "JAMES V. 87 1513. fine example of firmness and presence of mind. They issued a proclamation which was well adapted to re store order and resolution. It took notice of the rumour, touching their beloved monarch and his army, Avhich had reached the city, dAvelt on its uncertainty, and abstained from the mention of death or defeat ; it commanded the whole body of the townsmen to arm themselves at the sound of the common bell, for the defence of the city. It enjoined, under the pen alty of banishment, that no females should be seen crying or wailing in the streets; and concluded by recommending all women of the better sort to repair to the churches, and there offer up their petitions to the God of battles, for their sovereign lord and his host, with those of their felloAv citizens Avho sen'ed therein.1 It was soon discovered that, for the moment at least, Surrey had suffered so severely that he did not find himself strong enough to prosecute the victory, and an interval of deliberation was thus permitted to the country. Early in October, a parliament assembled at Perth, which, from the death of the floAver of the nobility at Flodden, consisted chiefly of the clergy.2 It proceeded first to the coronation of the infant king, which was performed at Scone with the usual solem nity, but amid the tears instead of the rejoicings of the people. Its attention was then directed to the condition of the country ; but its deliberations Avere hurried, and unfortunately no satisfactory record of them remains. Contrary to the customary law, the regency Avas committed to the queen-mother, from a feeling of affectionate respect to the late king.

It appears, hoAveA'er, that there was a party in Scotland which looked with anxiety on the measure of committing the chief situation in the government to a female, whose near connexion with England ren dered it possible that she might act under foreign influence; and a secret message was despatched by their leaders to the Duke of Albany, in France ; a nobleman who, in the event of the death of the young king, AATas the next heir to the throne, requesting him to repair to Scotland and assume the office of regent, Avhich of right belonged to his rank.2 In the meantime, the apprehensions of the country were quieted by the intelligence that Surrey had dis banded his host ; a proceeding to which that able commander was reduced, not only by the loss Avhich he had sustained, but by the impossibility of supporting an invading army without the co-operation of a fleet. It was probably on his own responsibility that Howard thus acted, for, on receiving accounts of the victory, whilst still in France, Henry appears to have been solicitous to folloAV up his advantage, and transmitted orders to Lord Dacre of the north, warden of the eastern marches, and Lord Darcy, directing them to make three principal incursions into Scotland.

The condition of the country, meanwhile, was alarming, and when men began to recover from the first impulses of grief, and to consider calmly the most probable schemes for the preservation of order, under the shock which it had received, the prospect on every side appeared almost hopeless. The dignified clergy, undoubtedly the ablest and best educated class in Scot land, from whose ranks the state had been accustomed to look for its Avisest councillors, were divided into feuds amongst themselves, occasioned by the vacant benefices. The Archbishop of St AndreAvs, the Pre lates of Caithness and the Isles, with other ecclesias tical dignitaries, had fallen in the field of Flodden, and the intrigues of the various claimants distracted the church and the council. There were evils also to be dreaded from the character and the youth of the queen mother. Margaret had been married at fourteen, and was now only twenty-four ; her talents were of so high an order that they dreAv forth the unbiassed encomium of Surrey, Dacre, and Wolsey ; but there were some traits in her disposition which remind us of her brother, Henry the Eighth. Her resentments were hasty, her firmness sometimes degenerated into obstinacy, her passions were often too strong for her better judg ment ; her beauty, vivacity, and high accomplishments, were fitted to delight and adorn a court, but imparted an early devotion to pleasure, too much encouraged by the example of the late king, and AA'hich his sudden and unhappy fate rather checked than eradicated.

The Duke of Albany had now received the invitation from the lords of his party ; and unable instantly to obey it in person, he sent over the Sieur D'Arsie de la Bastie,1 the same accomplished knight whom we have seen a favourite of James the Fourth, and who was already personally known to many of the Scottish nobles. Along with him came the Earl of Arran, who, since the unfortunate result of his naval expedition, by which the late king had been so deeply incensed, appears to have remained in France, in command of that portion of the fleet which was the property of the crown ; the remainder, consisting of merchant vessels commissioned by government, having probably long ago dispersed on private adventure. He was cousin german to Albany : the former being the son of Mary, sister to James the Third ; the latter of Alexander, the brother of that prince, whose treason, as we have seen, against the government in 1482, did not scruple to aim at the crown, and even to brand the reigning monarch with illegitimacy. Arran still bore the title of high-admiral, and brought to Scotland a few ships, the three largest vessels having been left behind in France. His high birth and near relationship to the royal family impressed him with the idea that his interference would be respected ; but his abilities were of an inferior order, and he found many proud nobles ready to dispute his authority. Amongst these, the principal Avere Home the chamberlain ; the Earl of Angus, the recent death of whose father and grand father had placed him, when still a young man, at the Lesley, p. 97-"], [97, "1514.

Between Home and Angus, a deadly feud existed ; the lesser nobles and gentry in the south joining themselves to one side or the other, as seemed most agreeable to their individual interests; whilst in Athole, and other northern districts, bands of robbers openly traversed the country ; and on the borders, the dignities and revenues of the church, and the benefices of the inferior clergy, became the subjects of violent and successful spoliation.1 In the midst of these scenes of public disorder, repeated attempts were made to assemble the parlia ment ; but the selfishness of private ambition, and the confusion of contradictory counsels, distracted the deliberations of the national council ; and the patriotic wisdom of the venerable Elphinston in vain attempted to compose their differences.2 It was, however, de termined, that for the immediate repressing of the disturbances, the Earl of CraAvford should be appointed chief justice to the north of the Forth, and Home to the same office in the south ; whilst, in contemplation of the continuance of the war with England, an attempt Avas made to derive assistance from the courts of Denmark and France. To the sovereigns of both these countries Scotland had readily lent her assistance in troops and in money : the insurrection of the Norwegians against the Danish monarch had been put down by her instrumentality ; and the war with England, which had cost the country so dear, had been undertaken at the instigation of France; yet from neither the one nor the other did the Scots, 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 120. 3 Dacre to the King, 10th March, Caligula, B. vi. 48, quoted in Tinkerton, vol. ii. p. 219."], [98, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1514. 92 in their day of calamity, receiA-e any thing like an equivalent for her sacrifices. The present policy of Lewis the TAvelfth, who had been reduced to ex tremity by the league formed against him, rendered this monarch solicitous for peace with England, and fearful of any step which might exasperate its sove reign. He not only, therefore, refused all active assistance, but ungenerously threw difficulties in the way of Albany's departure, pretending that he could not dispense with the services of so valuable a subject ; a mortifying lesson to Scotland upon the folly of her foreign alliances, but of which she had not yet the Avisdom to make the proper use. In the midst of this disturbance at home, and dis appointment abroad, the queen-mother was delivered of a son, who was named Alexander, and created Duke of Ross ; whilst a parliament, which met immediately after her recovery, confirmed her in the regency, and appointed \" three wise lords,\" whose names do not appear, to have the keeping of the young king and his brother.1 Yet, in spite of every endeavour to allay them, the disorders of the country continued ; and Avhilst the queen corresponded with her brother, lamenting the selfish ambition and fierce independence of Home, who arrogated to himself an almost royal authority, that monarch ungenerously abused her in formation, by directing his wardens of the border to repeat their inroads, and carry havock and war into the defenceless country. It Avas a miserable feature of feudal Scotland, (it may be said, indeed, of feudal Europe,) that a Avoman of any wealth or rank, who Avas deprived of the protection of a husband or father, became an object of attack, liable to be invaded in 1 Margaret to Dacre, Caligula, B. vi. 78."], [99, "1514. JAMES V. 93 her castle, and carried off by some of those remorseless barons, who, in the prosecution of their daring ends, little recked the means they used. The greater the prize, the more certain and alarming was the danger ; and as the possession of the person of the infant mo narch gave to any faction Avhich detained it the chief influence in the government, we may easily understand that the queen-mother, surrounded by a fierce and ambitious nobility, for the suppression of Avhose law less proceedings the authority Avith which she had been intrusted was insufficient, soon began to long for some more poAverful protector. That Margaret, therefore, should have thought of a second marriage was by no means extraordinary; but when it was declared that, without any previous consultation Avith her council, she had suddenly given her hand to the Earl of Angus, her best friends regretted her choice. It was evidently a match not so much of policy as of passion, for Angus is described by the sagacious Dacre as \" childish young, and attended by no Avise counsellors ;\" but his person and countenance were beautiful, his accomplishments sIioaaw and attractive, whilst his power, as the head of the house of Douglas, Avas equal, if not superior, to that of any baron in the kingdom. The queen herself Avas still in the bloom of her youthful charms ; and when her affections fixed upon Angus, she only waited for her recovery from childbirth, to hurry into marriage Avith a precipitancy which Avas scarcely decorous, and certainly unwise. By the terms of the royal will, it at once put an end to her regency ; and although Angus flattered himself that his neAV title, as husband of the queen, Avould confer upon him the tutelage of the infant sovereign, he Avas met by an opposition far more poAverful than he anticipated."], [100, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1514. 94 The peace betAveen France and England was now concluded ; and although Scotland was embraced in the treaty at the desire of Lewis, the cold and cautious terms in which that country was mentioned, might have convinced her rulers of the folly which had squandered so much treasure, and sacrificed so much national prosperity, for a sovereign whose gratitude lasted no longer than his necessity. It was stated that if, upon notification of the peace, the Scots were desirous of being included, there should be no objec tion urged to their wishes ; x but if, after intimation of these terms, which was to be made before the 15th of September, any invasions took place on the borders, the clause comprehending that country was to be of no effect. No invasion of any note did take place, but minor inroads on both sides disturbed, as usual, the peace of the marches ; and the difficulty of adjust ing these in the courts of the wardens, with the desire to postpone all leading measures till the arrival of Albany, occasioned a delay of eight months before Scotland acceded to the treaty. One of the immediate effects of the imprudent mar riage of the queen seems to have been, the separation of the nobility and the country into tAvo great factions, which took the names of the English and French parties. At the head of the former were Angus and the queen ; indeed, if we except the great poAver and widely ramifying vassalage of the House of Douglas, there were few other permanent sources of strength on which they could build their hopes. The latter, the French faction, embraced almost the whole nobi lity, and was supported by the sympathies of the people.

Nor could this event be much longer delayed. Lewis had now no pretext for his detention ; the peace with England was concluded, the sentence of forfeiture, which had excluded the duke from the enjoyment of his rank and estates in Scotland, was removed, and the condition of the country called loudly for some change. At this crisis, by the death of the venerable and patriotic Elphinston bishop of Aberdeen, was removed the only man who seemed to possess authority in the state, an occurrence which increased the struggles of ecclesiastical ambition.1 It was the intention of the queen to have appointed Elphinston to the arch bishoprick of St Andrews, but on his death she nomi nated to that see the celebrated Gawiu Douglas, her husband's uncle, \u2014 a man Avhose genius, had this been the only requisite for the important dignity, was cal culated to bestow distinction upon any situation.

An indecent spectacle was thus exhibited, Avhich could not fail to lower the church in the eyes of the people: the servants of Douglas, supported by his nephew and the queen, had seized the archiepiscopal palace, but were attacked by Hepburn, who carried the fortress, and kept possession of it, although threatened by Angus with a siege. Forman, however, had the address to secure the interest of Home the chamber lain, and a treaty having been entered into, in which money Avas the chief peacemaker, it was agreed, that Hepburn should surrender the castle, on condition of retaining the revenues which he had already collected, and receiving for his nephew the rich priory of Col dingham.1 These ecclesiastical commotions, however, were surpassed in intensity by the feuds amongst the nobles, who traversed the country at the head of large bodies of their armed vassals, and waged priArate war against each other with a ferocity Avhich defied all interference. The Earl of Arran, encouraged by the protracted delay of Albany, aspired to the regency ; and being joined by the Earls of Lennox and Glen cairn, declared Avar against Angus, who narrowly escaped falling into an ambuscade Avhich was laid for his destruction.

He even carried his intrigues so far as to make a secret proposal to Margaret for her immediate flight with the infant monarch and his brother into England; a scheme which amounted to nothing less than treason. The agents in this plot were Williamson, one of the creatures of Dacre, an English ecclesiastic resident in Scotland, and Sir James Inglis the secretary of the queen. Margaret, in reply, regretted that she was not a priATate woman, able to fly with her children from the land Avhere she Avas so unhappy, but a queen, Avho was narrowly watched ; Avhilst any failure in such an at tempt might have cost her servants their heads, and herself her liberty.

Meanwhile, although baffled in the perpetration of this project, the intrigues of Dacre contributed greatly to strengthen the English faction ; and Home, Avhose formidable power and daring character rendered his accession no light matter, embraced the party of the queen. Albany, Avho had long delayed his voyage, now began to think in earnest of repairing to Scotland. The death of Lewis the Twelfth, which had been followed by the accession of Francis the First, was accompanied by no material change in the policy of his kingdom towards her ancient ally ; and an embassy was despatched to induce the Scottish government to delay no longer accepting those terms by which they were comprehended in the peace between France and England. In a letter from the council of state, this request was complied with, on the ground, that al though not so far weakened by their recent disaster, as to doubt they should be soon able to requite their enemies ; yet, for the love they bore to France, and their zeal for the crusade against the infidels, which was then in agitation, they would be sorry that Scot land should oppose itself to a general peace.1 Scarce had Le Vaire and Villebresme, the French ambassadors, received this favourable ansAver, when, on the 18th of May, the Duke of Albany, with a squadron of eight ships, came to anchor at Dunbarton.2 1 Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 509. 3 These vessels appear to have been the remains of that fleet which"], [105, "1515.

The intrigues of Henry the Eighth, conducted with much skill and judgment by Lord Dacre, had separated from his party some of the most potent of the nobility, aat1io at a former period anxiously requested his presence ; and many good men, who anxiously desired a continu ance of peace, and deplored the calamities which an unnecessary war had already entailed upon the country, dreading the politics of Albany, Avhich soon disclosed an unreasonable animosity to England, threw their influence into the faction which opposed him : others, indeed, resented the interference of England in the Scottish councils, deeming it impolitic and unnatural that the monarch who had slain the father, and shed with unexampled profusion the noblest blood in the land, should be selected as the favoured counsellor of the infant successor and his widowed mother. To assert their independence as a kingdom, and to cherish a hope of revenge, were the principles which actuated no inconsiderable party ; nor is it to be doubted, that amongst the great body of the people these feelings Avere regarded Avith applause. Of this numerous class the new regent might have easily secured the support, had he not alienated them by a too servile devotion to James had despatched, under the Earl of Arran, to the assistance of the French monarch, and whose building and outfit had cost the country so large a sum.

From his father, who had traitorously attempted to seize the crown, and to brand the royal family with the stain of illegitimacy, he was not likely, they said, to imbibe very loyal ideas; whilst the late instance in England, of the crimes of Richard the Third, would not fail to suggest a lesson of successful usurpation and murder to a Scottish usurper, between wThom and his title to the throne there stood only the slender lives of two infants.

He was ignorant of the constitution, of the language, of the manners of the country : his loyalty to the French king, whom he constantly styled his master ; his ties to that king dom, where his life had been spent, his honours won, and his chief estates were situated ; his descent from a French mother, aud marriage with the Countess of Auvergne, were all enumerated, and with much plau sibility, as circumstances which incapacitated him from feeling that ardent and exclusive interest in Scotland which ought to be found in him to whom the regency was committed. When to all this it is added, that Albany was passionate in his temper, and sometimes capricious and wavering in his policy, it was not ex pected that his government would be attended with much success.

Albany was unmoved ; and the supporters of the queen, with the exception of Home and Angus, shrunk from an alliance which exposed them to so severe a reckon- ing.2 But the most important affair, and one which re quired immediate attention, was the custody of the young monarch and his brother. These princes were still under the charge of their mother, the queen dowager. The negotiations, however, into which she had entered with Henry the Eighth, and in the course of which Williamson and Dacre had almost prevailed on her to deliver the royal children to England, proved clearly that since her new connexion with Angus, she was unworthy to remain their protector. The regent, therefore, wisely judged that no time ought to be lost in removing them from her charge ; and for this pur pose a parliament was assembled at Edinburgh.

Eight lords were nominated by the parlia ment, out of which number four were to be chosen by lot ; and from these Margaret was to select three, to whose custody the king and his brother -were to be committed. This having been done, the three peers proceeded to the castle of Edinburgh, where the com mands of the parliament were to be carried into effect: but nothing was farther than obedience from the mind of the queen. When the nobles approached, the gates of the fortress were thrown open, disclosing to the populace, who rent the air with their acclamations, their royal mistress standing at the entrance, with the king at her side, his hand locked in hers, and a nurse behind, who held his infant brother in her arms.1 The sight was imposing; nor was its effect diminished, when, with an air of dignity, and a voice whose full tones all could distinctly hear, she bade them stand and declare their errand. On their answer, that they came in the name of the parliament, to receive from her their sovereign and his brother, the princess com manded the warder to drop the portcullis ; and that massive iron barrier having instantly descended be tween her and the astonished delegates, she thus ad dressed them : \u2014 \" I hold this castle by the gift of my late husband, your sovereign, who also intrusted to me the keeping and government of my children; nor shall I y. Id them to any person whatsoever : but I respect the parliament, and require a respite of six days to con sider their mandate.\" Alarmed for the consequences of this refusal, which, if persevered in, amounted to 1 Dacre to the Council.

She then transmitted her final answer to the regent : it proposed that the children should be committed to the custody of Angus, Home, the earl marshal, and Lauder of the Bass, \u2014 all of them, with the exception of the marshal, devoted to her interest, and in intimate correspondence with England.2 This evasion, which was nothing more than a reiteration of her refusal to obey the orders of parliament, rendered it necessary for Albany to adopt decisive measures. He accordingly collected an armed force, summoned all the lords, on their alle giance, to lend their assistance in enforcing the orders of the supreme council of the nation ; directed Ruth ven and Borthwick to blockade the castle of Stirling, so that no provisions should be permitted to enter ; and commanded Home, who was then Provost of Edinburgh, to arrest Sir George Douglas, the brother of Angus, that peer being himself in the Mearns ; whilst his uncle held Douglas castle. Home indig nantly refused, and, under cover of night, fled to New ark, a border tower upon the Yarrow ; whilst Angus, who had received orders to join the host at the head of his vassals, kept himself within his strength in his own country, and concentrated his power for the storm which he saw approaching. 1 Caligula, B. ii. 341, b. 2. s Ibid."], [110, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1515. 104 A proclamation was now issued against such persons as illegally retained the castle of Stirling; and Albany, at the head of seven thousand men, and attended by all the peers, except Home and Angus, marched against that fortress, and summoned it to an immediate sur render. Resistance was hopeless ; and the queen had already carried her obstinacy beyond all prudent bounds. Her party, which chiefly consisted of friends retained in her service by the money of England, de serted her when the danger became imminent ; and requesting an interview with the regent, she delivered the keys of the castle to the infant monarch, who placed them in the hand of Albany, and only added her hope, that the royal children, herself and Angus, would be treated with favour. The answer of the regent assured the princess, that to herself and his infant sovereign, he was animated by no feelings but those of devoted loyalty ; but for Angus, whose opposition to the will of parliament, and dangerous correspondence with England, amounted, he declared, to treason, he would promise nothing, so long as he and his followers were banded together in open rebellion.1 The king and his infant brother were then committed to the custody of the earl marshal, (a nobleman, who had been nominated on a former occasion by the royal mother herself,) along with the Lords Fleming and Borth- Avick, whose fidelity to the crown was unsuspected. John Erskine was appointed governor of the fortress ; a guard of seven hundred soldiers left in it ; and the queen conducted with every mark of respect to Edin burgh, where she took up her residence in the castle.

To this meeting Angus was not admitted, by the saga city of the English warden, his youth and versatility of purpose being dreaded ; but Home continued to work on the husband of the queen, and the strength of Teviotdale was raised to resist the alleged tyranny of the regent, and avert the destruction which hung over the English party in Scotland.1 In this emergency, the conduct of Albany was marked by prudence and decision : he summoned the force of the kingdom ; but, before proceeding to hosti lities, transmitted a message to the queen, in which he expressed his earnest desire for a pacification, and proposed articles of agreement, which were more fa vourable than the conduct of her party deserved. He engaged to support her and her husband in all their just and equitable actions ; to put her in full posses sion of her jointure lands, and maintain her in the state and dignity befitting her rank ; under the condi tion that she should accede to the wishes of the parlia ment, co-operate in those measures which were esteemed best for the security and independence of the state, and renounce all secret connexion with other realms, especially with England. When Henry's schemes for the removal of the king and his brother, and the intrigues by which Dacre contrived to defeat every attempt to reduce the country to order and good government are taken into view, these proposals appear wise and conciliatory. Yet such was the unhappy infatuation of the queen, that she rejected them with out hesitation ; and to make a merit of her firmness, transmitted them privately to Dacre.2 To Home 1 Dacre to the Council.

The crisis, he said, only required immediate activity and vigour, by which the monarch might destroy his enemies, and new-model the government according to his interest and wishes.1 These offers were strongly seconded by Dacre, who advised an invasion ; whilst the chamberlain, assured of the support of England, assembled a powerful force, and commenced the war by retaking the castle of Home, which had been seized by the regent, and securing the strong tower of Bla cater, situated on the borders, within five miles of Berwick.2 To this safe-hold, the queen, who had continued her secret correspondence with Henry, now resolved to retire, finding herself, as she represented, in a sort of captivity at Edinburgh, whilst her friends were imprisoned, and her resources impoverished by the injustice of the regent. Dacre had recommended Blacater from its proximity to England, and the faci lity she would enjoy of support and communication with her royal brother ; shrewdly observing, also, that, being within the Scottish borders, her enemies could not allege that she had forfeited her rights by deserting the country. She accordingly found means to join Lord Home, who, at the head of an escort of forty soldiers, conveyed her in safety to Blacater ; from 1 Caligula, B. ii. 186.

Henry, although professing peace, was at this moment the worst enemy of Scotland. Having been baffled in his attempt to get the young king into his hands, it became his object to increase the neces sary evils of a minority, by thwarting every measure which promised to restore tranquillity to that country. By means of his indefatigable agent, Lord Dacre, he had not only corrupted some of its leading nobility, but so successfullyfomented dissensions amongst them, that every effort of the regent to re-establish the control of the laws, was rendered abortive by the prevalence of private war. To league herself, therefore, with Eng land, against the independence of that country of which her son was sovereign, whilst Albany, with much ear nestness and sincerity, offered her a complete restora tion to all those rights and revenues, as queen-dowager, which she had not forfeited by her marriage, was an excess of blindness and pertinacity difficult to be under stood, and which drew after it the most calamitous consequences. The conduct of Albany had been marked hitherto by a laudable union of firmness and moderation ; and so completely was it seconded by the approval of the nobles and the clergy, that although on other points at variance amongst themselves, all appear to have united in support of his determination to enforce obedience to the parliament, and restore some degree of stability to the government. He found little diffi culty, therefore, in raising an army of forty thousand men : but anxious that his intentions should be clearly 1 Credence to Lord Dacre and Thomas Magnus, by the Queen of Scots.

At the same time, John Duplanis, a French envoy, was commissioned to renew the terms for an agreement, which had been formerly offered to the queen, and which this ill-advised prin cess once more indignantly repelled. The regent instantly advanced to the borders, where it was expected the Earl of Home would be able to make some serious resistance ; but the power of this dreaded chief melted away before the formidable array of Albany : he was taken prisoner ; committed to the charge of the Earl of Arran; found means to seduce his keeper, not only to favour but to accompany his escape ; and fled to England, whither he was soon after followed by the queen and Angus.1 No step could have been adopted more favourable to the in trigues of Henry ; and the fugitives were received by Lord Dacre with open arms. The queen, shortly before this, had addressed a letter to Albany, in which she attempted a vindication of her conduct. Necessity had compelled her, she asserted, to forsake her country, not without fears for her life ; she pro tested against the conduct of the regent, and claimed as a right, conferred on her by the will of the late king her husband, (a deed which had received the papal confirmation,) the government of the kingdom, and the tutelage of the infant monarch.2 The first 1 Dacre and Dr. Magnus to Henry the Eighth, Harbottle. 18th October.

JAMES V. 109 pretence was ridiculous : for since his arrival in Scot land, Margaret had been treated by Albany with invariable respect. To the second request, the council of Scotland returned the answer, that by her second marriage, Margaret, according to the terms of the royal will, had forfeited all right to the tutelage of her son ; whilst the disposal of the government could neither be affected by the will of a deceased monarch, nor the sanction of a living pope, but belonged to the three estates, who had conferred it upon the Duke of Albany.1 That nobleman, notwithstanding the infatuation of the mother of his sovereign, was still anxious to make a last effort for a compromise : he addressed two letters to her on the same day ; the first a manifesto from the council ; the other, a private communication written with his own hand. The terms of both were moderate, and even indulgent. The council implored her to awake to her duty ; declared their aversion to all rigorous measures; besought her to come back amongst them ; and, as an inducement, promised that she should enjoy the disposal of all benefices within her dowery lands, a benefice to. her late counsellor, Gawin Douglas ; and lastly, the guardianship of her children, if she would solemnly promise, that they should not be carried out of the kingdom. These proposals the queen imprudently rejected ; for what reasons does not clearly appear. An acute historian2 pronounces them too specious to be honest ; but Albany's whole conduct shows them to have been sincere, although Margaret, acting under the influence of Angus, Home, and Arran, had been taught to regard them with suspicion.

This agreement, which was dated loth of October, 1515, although it bears no express reference to England, appears to have been concluded under the direction of Lord Dacre.1 Nothing now remained for Albany but to exercise with firmness the authority which had been committed to him ; yet although the conduct of those who leagued themselves against the government compelled him to measures of just severity, he evinced an anxiety for conciliation. The flight of Arran rendered it necessary for him to seize the castles of a rebel ; but when, at Hamilton, his mother presented herself before the regent, and passionately interceded for her son, he received the matron, who was a daughter of James the Second, with the respect due to her royal descent, and assured her of forgiveness, could she prevail on him to return to his allegiance. Nor was he forgetful of his promise ; for Arran, a nobleman of a weak and vacillat ing though ambitious character, renounced the league with Angus as precipitately as he had embraced it, and was immediately received into favour.

JAMES V. 111 was seized with one of the diseases incident to his early years, and died at Stirling ; a circumstance which it was to be expected would not be lost upon the queen, who instantly fulminated against Albany an accusation of poison. So atrocious a charge fell innoxious upon the upright character of the regent, who, although the nearest heir to the crown, had felt enough of its thorns to make him rather dread than desire the kingdom ; and the future conduct of Angus and Home, from whose faction the calumny proceeded, demonstrates its falsehood. Yet the enmity of Gawin Douglas, the accomplished bishop of Dunkeld, did not hesitate, in 1522, to repeat the story. These events were followed by a renewal of the alliance with France ; and to evince that the governor was animated by a sincere desire for that tranquillity which could alone afford him leisure to compose the troubles of the country, Duplanis the French ambas sador, and Dunbar archdean of St Andrews, were sent to meet the English commissioners at Coldingham, for the negotiation of a peace between the twro countries. At this moment Henry earnestly desired such an event : the success of Francis the First, at the battle of Marignano, had given to this prince the whole Milanese, and roused the jealousy of Wolsey, who, now directing, but with no profound policy, the councils of England, prevailed on his master and the emperor to enter into a league for the expulsion of the French from Italy. It was necessary, therefore, to be secure on the side of Scotland ; and although a general peace could not be then concluded, the truce between the kingdoms was renewed.1 Home and Angus, Whose conduct had been dictated by the selfishness of disap- 1 Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 549."], [118, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1515. 112 pointed ambition, were awakened by these prudent measures to the desperate state of their affairs ; and soon after, withdrawing themselves from the queen, who lay dangerously ill at Morpeth, they retired into Scotland, where, restored once more to their hereditary possessions, they for a time abstained from all opposi- tion to the government. The facility with which these nobles appear to have procured their pardon, was in the regent perhaps more generous than prudent ; but it evinces the sincerity of his desire for the welfare of the country, and seems completely to refute those charges of insatiate avarice, and profuse dissipation, raised against him by the malice of his enemies, and too hastily retailed by a historian of this period.1 For the conduct of Home the queen found some ex- cuse, but to be thus deserted at her utmost need by a husband for whom she had sacrificed her royal pomp and power, was an ungrateful return for her love, which Margaret's proud spirit never forgave. She waited only for her recovery to fly to the English court, where she loaded Albany and Angus with re proaches, imploring her royal brother to interfere for the preservation of her son, and her restoration to those rights which in truth had been forfeited solely by her own imprudence. Nor was Henry deaf to her entreaties : overlooking the conciliatory principles which marked the govern ment of Albany, and which, in spite of the bribery and intrigues of Dacre, had received the support of the people, this monarch directed a letter to the three estates, in which, in no measured terms, he called upon 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 155, who, without considering its suspicious tenor, gives implicit belief to the Memorial of Gawin Douglas, Caligula, B. iii. p. 309, and to the \" Wrongs\" of the queen, Caligula, B. ii. p. 211 : an original signed by \"Margaret.\""], [119, "JAMES V. 1516. 113 them not only to remove that nobleman from the regency and the care of the king's person, but to expel him from the kingdom ; upon the ground that, as the nearest heir to the throne, he was the most suspicious person to whom so sacred a charge could be committed. To this extraordinary epistle, which was laid before them in a parliament assembled at Edinburgh, on the 1st of July, 1516, the estates returned a decided an swer. They reminded Henry that the Duke of Albany was governor by their own deliberate choice, expressed in a general council of the nation held immediately after the coronation of their youthful sovereign. He had undertaken, they said, this high and responsible office, which by the canon law belonged to him as nearest relative to the infant king, not from his own wishes, but at their earnest request. He had left the service of France, and his estates and honours in that country, with reluctance ; he had fulfilled its duties with much talent and integrity ; and they declared that, so essential did they consider his remaining at the head of affairs to the national happiness, that, were he willing, they would not permit him to escape his duties or to leave the country. With regard to the anxiety expressed for the safety of the infant monarch, they observed that it appeared wholly misplaced in the present instance, as the person of the sovereign was intrusted to the keeping of the same lords to whose care he had been committed by his mother the queen; whilst they concluded with great firmness and dignity, by assuring the English monarch, that it was their determination to resist with their lives every attempt to disturb the peace of the realm, or endanger the security of the present government.1 1 Rymer, Foedera, vol. xiii. p. 550.

The means and agents by which this wTas effected were as base as they were successful. From an original letter of the warden himself, addressed to Wolsey, we learn that he had in his pay four hundred Scots, whose chief employment was to distract the government of Albany by exciting popular tumults, encouraging private quar rels, and rekindling the jealousy of the higher nobles. \" I labour and study all I can,\" says he, \" to make division and debate, to the intent that, if the duke will not apply himself, that then debate may grow that it shall be impossible for him to do justice ; and for that intended purpose I have the Master of Kil maurs kept in my house secretly, which is one of the greatest parties in Scotland. * * And also (he adds) I have secret messages from the Earl of Angus and others, * * and also four hundred outlawes, and giveth them rewards, that burneth and destroyeth daily in Scotland, all being Scotsmen that should be under the obedience of Scotland.\"1 Such was the commence ment by Dacre of that shameful system for the fostering of internal commotions, by the agency of spies and the distribution of bribes amongst the nobles, which 1 Letter, Dacre to Wolsey, 23d August, 1516.

JAMES V. 115 was continued by Sir Ralph Saddler, and afterwards brought to perfection by Lord Burleigh under Eliza- beth. It is to this cause, and not, as has generally been believed, to any fault or gross mismanagement upon the part of the regent, that we must ascribe the misery of the country. Albany was supported by the affection and confidence of the middle classes, and the great body of the nation ; but their influence was counteracted, and his efforts completely paralyzed, by the selfish rapacity of the clergy, and the insolent ambition of the aristocracy.1 Scarcely had Arran returned to his allegiance, when he entered into a new combination with Lennox, Glencairn, Mure of Cald- well, and other barons, with the apparent object of wresting from the regent that share in the government to which Arran not unjustly deemed himself entitled, by his affinity to the royal family, but for which his vacillating character totally incapacitated him. The rebellion at first assumed a serious aspect : the castle of Glasgow, belonging to Beaton archbishop of that see, and which was important from its being the depot of the king's artillery, was stormed and plundered by Mure, who enriched himself by the spoil and retained it for Arran ;2 but the promptitude and energy of Albany, who instantly assembled an army and marched to the spot, overawed the conspirators and compelled them to submit to terms. The fortress was surren dered. Beaton the primate employed his influence to obtain the pardon of Arran with his associate earls ; and Albany, who often erred on the side of leniency, once* more received them to the peace of the king; 1 To this observation there were a few exceptions, but these had little influence where the majority were corrupted. 2 Mure of Caldwell had married Lady Jane Stewart, sister to the Earl of Lennox. \u2014 MS. document, in possession of William Mure, Esq. of Caldwell."], [122, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1516. 116 whilst Mure, an able and turbulent baron, who was nearly connected with Lennox, profiting by the com motion, continued to excite disturbances in the west country. It had been under the condition of his renouncing all secret intercourse with Henry the Eighth, and residing peaceably on his estates, that Albany had extended forgiveness to Home. But it soon became apparent that the attempt to secure his adherence to the government was hopeless. His correspondence with Dacre Avas renewed ; bands of hired marauders, known to be followers of the Scottish earl, and in the pay of England, broke across the marches, and ravaged the country with unexampled boldness and ferocity. Murders, rapine, fire-raising, and every species of outrage, threatened the total dissolution of society ; and it became necessary either to vindicate the laws by an example of instantaneous severity, or weakly to abandon the government to the anarchy by which it was invaded. Under these circumstances, Home and his brother, either trusting to Albany's ignorance of their correspondence, or inveigled by his promises, imprudently visited the court, and were instantly apprehended. Much obscurity hangs over the trial which followed ; and if we may believe some of our historians, the charge of having excited the late commotions against the regent, was mingled with a more atrocious accusation of being accessary to the defeat at Flodden, and the death of the late king. That this last imputation Avas unfounded, seems to be proved by sufficient evidence; but the truth of the first was notorious, and could be established by a multiplicity of witnesses. The lord chamberlain was accordingly found guilty : against his brother the same sentence was pronounced; and both were executed"], [123, "JAMES V. 1516. 117 without delay, their heads being afterwards exposed above the Tolbooth or public prison of the capital.1 Ker of Fernyhirst,2 one of their chief followers and a baron of great power on the marches, Avas also tried and condemned, but respited by the regent, who in stantly led a powerful force to Jedburgh, and, by a judicious severity, reduced the unquiet districts on the border to a state of temporary repose. The office of chamberlain was bestowed upon Lord Fleming, a nobleman of tried fidelity; whilst the French knight, De la Bastie, who was much in the confidence of the regent, and possessed of equal courage and experience, became warden of the east borders ; an appointment deeply resented by the friends of Home, who secretly meditated, and at length accomplished a cruel revenge. On his return to Edinburgh, Albany assembled the parliament. Its principal business was the disposal of a singular claim presented by his step-brother Alexander Stewart, which, had it been supported by the three estates, must have excluded him from the regency. Stewart was the eldest son of Alexander duke of Albany, the regent's father, by his first mar riage Avith a daughter of the Earl of Orkney ; but it was now declared that this marriage had been pro nounced unlawful by a vote of a former parliament, and on this ground the title of Albany, the eldest son by a second marriage, was confirmed as the second person in the realm, and nearest heir to the crown.3 Not long after, Francis de Bordeaux, ambassador from the court of France, arrived in Scotland ; and the expectations of the regent and the parliament were 1 Lesley, Hist.

It was soon, hoAveATer, discovered that the policy of that kingdom toAvards Scotland had undergone a considerable change. The treaty of Noyon, concluded on the 26th of August, 1516, between Francis the First and the King of Spain, had secured to the former monarch his conquests in Italy : the emperor Maximilian, after an ineffectual attempt to wrest from him the duchy of Milan, had been compelled to retire and accede to its provisions ; Avhilst to France the single difficulty remained of re moving the enmity of Henry the Eighth. It is this object which explains the coldness of Francis to his ancient allies, the Scots. They had claimed a restitu tion of the county of Xaintonge, originally assigned by Charles the Seventh to James the First in 1428 ; but their demand was evaded : they had requested the aid of France against England ; it was not only re fused, but an advice added, recommending the regent to conclude a peace Avith that country upon the first occasion which offered : nay, not content with this startling dereliction of those principles upon the per manence of Avhich Albany had too securely rested, the French monarch refused to ratify the alliance betAveen France and Scotland, Avhich had been renewed by his ambassador Duplanis and the Scottish council of regency, within a year after the death of James the Fourth. We are not to Avonder that such conduct increased, in no small degree, the difficulties Avhich already em barrassed the regent. His conduct in his high office had been marked by ability and disinterestedness. He had maintained the independence of Scotland by resisting the rude dictation of Henry; but he shoAved"], [125, "1516. JAMES V. 119 every desire to cultivate peace with England upon a fair basis : he had punished, with a severity to Avhich he was compelled by their frequent repetition, the treasons of Home, and the excesses of the borders ; he had shown the utmost anxiety to recall the queen mother to her country and her duties, provided such an event could be accomplished without endangering the safety of the young monarch ; and the confidence in his administration, which was expressed by parlia ment, had given a decided refutation to the injurious attacks of his enemies. But these enemies were still powerful ; the money of England and the intrigues of Dacre continued to seduce many venal persons amongst the Scottish nobles : their vassals were encouraged to weaken the government by spoliations, private feuds, and every species of unlicensed oppression ; whilst every attempt to introduce into the great body of the aristocracy a principle of cordial union Avhich might at once secure the integrity of the country, and promote their own interests, Avas broken by the selfishness and rapacity of their leaders. Under such disheartening circumstances, the regent had looked to the support of France, as a counterpoise to the concealed attacks of England; but this was iioav about to be AvithdraAvn;1 and, in the parliament which assembled in November, 1516, to deliberate upon the communication of the French ambassador, Albany, Avith much earnestness, requested permission of the three estates to revisit France for a short period. From all Avho Avere interested in the Avelfare of the country, this proposal met Avith a vigorous opposition.

His leave of absence, however, extended only to four months ; and in this interval, the manage ment of the government was intrusted to a council of regency consisting of the prelates of St Andrews and GlasgOAV, with the Earls of Huntley, Argyle, Angus, and Arran. The young king was brought to Edin burgh castle, and intrusted to the keeping of Lord Erskine and the earl marshal.

At Lamberton Kirk, the same familiar spot where, fourteen years before, she had been received by the Scottish nobles, the blooming bride of her sovereign, she was met by Angus, Morton, and De la Bastie ; but on her arrival in Edinburgh, was not permitted to visit her son the king. It was soon after understood, that the plague had made its appearance in the capital, and his guardians took the precaution of removing the young monarch to Craigmillar, where, relaxing in their rigour, his mother was indulged with occasional inter views : but a report having arisen that a secret project had been formed for his being carried into England, (an attemptwhich the former conduct of the queen rendered it exceedingly likely would be repeated,) it was thought proper once more to restore him to the security of his original residence.1 To ensure, if possible, the continuance of quiet to the country during his absence, Albany had carried along Avith him, as hostages, the eldest sons of many of the noblest families, whilst he had committed the principal command upon the borders, at all times the most distracted and lawless portion of the country, to the chivalrous and polished De la Bastie, Avhose talents in the field and in the cabinet Avere still higher than his accomplishments in the lists.

Nor Avas this opportunity long of occur ring : keeping his state as warden in the fortress of Dunbar, La Bastie exerted himself Avith indefatigable diligence in repressing disorder.

Conscious of the cruel fate Avhich awaited him, he pushed his horse to speed, and, from the extraordinary fleetness of the animal, had nearly escaped, when his ignorance of the country unfortunately led him into a marsh. Every effort entangled him more deeply : it Avas in vain that he struggled to extricate himself, in vain that he besought his merciless pursuers, as they A7alued their honour as knights, to spare his life and accept his submission : the only reply was, insult and mockery ; and, throAving themselves upon him, he Avas 1 I have heard that there is a curious MS. history of the family of Wedderburn, at Wedderburn-house, which gives some minute and interesting particulars regarding the murder of De la Bastie.

The ferocious Lord of Wedder burn, exulting in the complete though tardy vengeance, cut off his head, tied it by its long and plaited tresses to his saddle-bow, and, galloping into the town of Dunse, affixed the ghastly trophy on the market cross. He then threw himself into his castle, where for a season he defied the utmost efforts of the laws.1 The death of La Bastie was a serious blow to the maintenance of the authority of Albany : but although unable instantly to arrest the perpetrators, the regents exerted themselves with considerable vigour. It Avas suspected that Angus, or at least his brother, Sir George Douglas, had been involved in the guilt of the Homes, and on this ground Arran, the next in power amongst the nobles, was appointed warden of the marches. Without delay he seized Douglas and his accomplice Mark Ker : measures also were taken for the trial of the Homes, whose escape might have produced the worst consequences ; and a parliament having assem bled at Edinburgh on the 19th of February, sentence of forfeiture was passed against all concerned in the assassination of La Bastie. The more difficult task remained in the apprehension of the culprits ; but Arran having assembled a poAverful force, accompanied by the king's artillery, an arm of war which the nation OAved to the late monarch, marched against the insur gents. Ere he had advanced many miles, however, the rebels besought his mercy. The keys of the castle of Home were delivered to him at Lauder, the forti fied houses of Langton and Wedderburn thrown open, and the warden, with perhaps too great a leniency, extended even to the principal murderers a pardon.

The chief power, therefore, con tinued in the hands of the regency, and a renewal of the truce Avith England2 gave some leisure to attend to the healing of the wounds which still deeply rankled in the country. Of these one of the chief was to be found in the condition of the Isles, where the rude in habitants had lately signalized themselves by unusual violence and disorder. Under the latter years of the reign of James the Fourth, these districts had been unusually tranquil. It had not been the sole policy of that monarch to overawe the seditious by the severity of his measures : he had endeavoured to humanize them by education, and to introduce a knowledge of the laws, aud a respect for their sanctions ; not through the suspected medium of lowlanders, but by supporting Highland scholars at the universities, and afterwards encouraging them to reside permanently within the bounds of the Isles. It was as an additional means for the accomplishment of this enlightened purpose, that 1 Caligula, B. i. p. 247.

JAMES V. 125 this monarch was ever anxious to get into his power the sons of the Highland chiefs, whom he educated at court ; hoping thus to attach them to his service, and to employ them afterwards as useful instruments in the civilisation of their country. With this view, he had secured in some of his northern expeditions the youthful sons of Sir Alexander Macdonald of Loch alsh,1 and the eldest of these became a favourite of the monarch. He restored part of his paternal estate ; conferred on him the distinction of knighthood ; and permitted him frequently to visit the Isles.2 Upon the death of this sovereign, it was soon discovered that these favours had been thrown away, for scarcely had the chieftains escaped from the carnage at Flodden and returned home, when a rebellion wTas secretly organized, of which the object was to restore the ancient princi pality of the Isles in the person of Sir Alexander Mac donald of Lochalsh. At the head of this insurrection was Maclean of Dowart,3 commonly called Lauchlan Cattanach, and Macleod of Dun\\-egan, who seized the castles of Carnelreigh and Dunskaich, and threatened with the extremity of fire and sword all who resisted the authority of the new Lord of the Isles. It needed not this fresh source of disorganization to weaken the administration of Albany : and although a commission to put down the insurrection was early given to the Earl of Argyle, and his efforts were seconded by the exertions of Mackenzie of Kintail, EAven Alanson, and Monro of Foulis, the rebellion against the government spread through Lochaber and western Ross.

Under assurances of safety, the principal leaders repaired to court, and the chief of Lochalsh procured for himself and his folloAvers favourable terms of reconciliation.1 Scarce, however, had he returned to his remote domi nions, when, owing to a feud Avhich he had long main tained against Mac-Ian of Ardnamurchan, the flames of civil discord were again kindled in the Isles, and the ferocity of private warfare soon assumed the more serious shape of rebellion against the state. Ample powers were again granted to Argyle, as lieutenant general over the Isles ; and Maclean of Dowart, lately the chief supporter of Macdonald, having procured a remission for all the crimes committed by himself and his adherents during the insurrection, not only deserted his cause, but engaged in hostilities against him with a violence Avhich declared that nothing but the utter destruction of the \" wicked blood of the Isles \" would restore tranquillity to the government of his soArereign, or security to the inhabitants of these remote districts. There seems reason to belieA'e, however, that the ex tensive power granted by the council to Argyle and Maclean, Avas more nominal than real ; for although broken in his strength, the indefatigable claimant of the throne of the Isles remained unsubdued; and having united his forces to those of the Macleods and Alexander of Isla, he was strong enough to attack and entirely defeat his mortal enemy Mac-Ian, at Craig- 1 Gregory's History of the West Highlands, p. 114-117."], [133, "1518-19.

Mac-Ian himself, Avith his two sons, were amongst the slain : the ferocious islanders, who had a heavy arrear of blood to settle with this powerful chief, exulted in the ample vengeance by which he had been overtaken ; and the consequences of this victory might have proved serious, had not the rebellion been brought to an unexpected close by the death of Macdonald of Lochalsh, who left no descen dants to dispute the claims of the throne to the lordship of the Isles. From this period till the assumption of the supreme poAver by James the Fifth, the principality of the Isles remained in comparative tranquillity, OAving principally to the exertions of the Earl of Argyle, Avhose activity and loyalty are perhaps to be traced as much to his ambition of family aggrandize ment, as to any higher patriotic motive. Although tranquillity was thus restored in these remote districts, the country continued disturbed. Much of the disorder was to be traced to the violence and ambition of Angus, Avhose feudal power Avas too great for a subject, and whose disappointment in being refused the regency, delighted to vent itself in an open defiance of the laws. For a Avhile his reconciliation with the queen, to whom, as the mother of their so vereign, the nation still looked Avith affection, imparted a Aveight to his faction, which rendered him a formid able opponent to the regency ; but the fickleness of his attachment, his propensity to Ioav pleasures, and the discovery of a mistress whom he had carried off from her friends and secluded in Douglasdale, once more rekindled the resentment of the proud princess whom he had deserted, and an open rupture took place. She assumed a high tone, violently upbraided him for his inconstancy, reminded him that with misplaced affec tion she had even paAvned her jewels to support him in"], [134, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1518. 128 his difficulties, and concluded by expressing her deter mination to sue for a divorce.1 As soon as this resolution, in which the queen was supported by the most powerful of the nobles, became known in England, Henry, Avho foresaw in its being carried into effect a death-bloAV to his influence in Scotland, opposed it Avith his characteristic impetu osity. He despatched Chatsworth, a friar who filled the office of minister-general of the Obsen'antines in England, with letters to his sister, and enjoined him at the same time to remonstrate against the divorce ; a commission which he fulfilled with much violence, declaring that the measure was illegal, that she was labouring under some damnable delusion ; and insinu ating in no measured terms, that a strict examination of her own conduct might provoke from Angus a counter charge of adultery. It is easy to see in all this a proof that Henry considered Angus as the head of the English faction, and that the queen, with the principal nobles, Arran, Argyle, Lennox, Fleming, and Maxwell, had become aware of the importance of a more cordial union against the intrigue and domination of England. Such, hoAvever, was the effect of this remonstrance, that Margaret, if not convinced, was intimidated ; and, against the advice of her counsellors, a reconciliation took place between her and Angus, which was as insincere as it was precipitate.2 From these domestic dissensions the attention of the regency was drawn to a mission from Christiern the Second, the Danish king, who earnestly petitioned from his Scottish allies a subsidy of a thousand High land soldiers3 to assist him in his Norwegian wars. 1 Caligula, B. i. 275.

A few years after this, hoAvever, the reiterated requests of the Danish monarch were met by the grant of a small body of troops under the command of Stewart of Ardgowan ; J but the tyranny of Christiern, and the piracies of the Danish privateers upon the fleets of their merchantmen, effectually cooled the zeal of their allies, and no further auxiliaries appear to have left the coun try to the assistance of the unpopular monarch. On his return to France, Albany carried with him an authority from the parliament to superintend the foreign affairs of Scotland ; and it is to his credit that, in the disposal of benefices, at that period one of the most lucrative sources of peculation, his applications to the pope were, without exception, in favour of natives : a circumstance which affords a satisfactory answer to the accusations which his enemies have brought against him of a blameable love of money, and a want of national feeling. The continued change in the policy of the French king now caused the re newal of the peace Avith England ; and Francis having included his allies, the Scots, in the treaty,2 provided they agreed to its terms, La Fayette and Cordelle arrived as ambassadors in England, from whence, in company of Clarencieux herald, they proceeded into Scotland.

To these wise proceedings the only opposition Avhich was offered came from the Earl of Angus. As this haughty noble, whose great estates and numerous vas salry rendered him at all times formidable, increased in years, his character, throwing off the excesses of youth, discovered a power and talent for Avhich his opponents were not prepared, and his ambition, Avhich had hitherto only given occasional distress, became systematically dangerous to the government. His faction was numerous ; embracing the Earls of Craw ford and Errol, the Lord Glammis, the prelates of St Andrews, Aberdeen, Orkney, and Dunblane, with many other dignitaries and partisans. On the arrival of the French ambassadors at the capital, he had made an ineffectual effort to intrude into the place of Arran, and undertake the management of the treaty; but this being peremptorily declined, he intercepted them on their return to England at the head of a formidable array of his vassals, and rudely upbraided them for their alleged contempt of his authority.2 1 Margaret to Wolsey, Stirling, 26th Dec.

But on repairing from Dalkeith, where the court was then held, to the metropolis, he found the gates shut against him, and Archibald Douglas, the uncle of Angus, installed in the civic chair.1 The partisans of the lieutenant-general, the title now given to Arran, attempted to force their en trance, but were repulsed with bloodshed ; and Gawin, a carpenter, the friend of Angus and the principal leader of the tumult, was slain by Sir James Hamilton, commonly called the bastard of Arran. About the same time, Home of Wedderburn, whose wife was the sister of Angus, and whose hands had been recently stained by the blood of De la Bastie, added the guilt of sacrilege to murder, by assassinating the Prior of Coldingham with six of his family, and thus making way for the intrusion of William Douglas, the brother of Angus, who instantly seized the priory. When such were the steps of ecclesiastical promotion, and such the character of the dignitaries who ascended them, we are scarcely to Avonder that respect for the hierarchy did not form a feature in the age. But to this censure it must be alloAved that there were eminent exceptions; and a remarkable one is to be found in the learned, pious, and venerable Dunbar bishop of Aberdeen, avIio, living himself in primitive simplicity, refused to expend the minutest portion of his revenues upon his personal Avants, and entirely devoted them to Avorks of public utility and extensive charity.2 1 Dacre to Wolsey, 10th Dec.

But, upon the meeting of a parliament which had been summoned for the healing of these disturbances, a scene occurred which is too characteristic to be omitted. The capital, where the estates were to as semble, had been partially abandoned by the partisans of Angus, who retained as a body-guard only four hundred spearmen ; whilst, in consequence of a re commendation transmitted by Albany the late regent, which wisely directed that, for the public peace, no person of the name of Hamilton or Douglas should be chosen provost, Archibald Douglas had resigned that dignity, and Robert Logan had been elected in his place. The party of Angus were thus greatly weak ened in the city, and Arran the governor mustered in such strength, that his friends, of whom Beaton the archbishop of Glasgow and chancellor of the kingdom was the principal, deemed that the opportunity of reducing the OATergrown power of Angus was too favour able to be neglected. For the discussion of their designs a council of the principal leaders Avas held in the church of the Black Friars, AA'here' Gawin Douglas, the cele brated Bishop of Durikeld, appeared as a peacemaker between the contending factions. Addressing himself to Beaton the primate, Ayho wore a coat of mail under his linen rocquet, he earnestly remonstrated against their intention of arresting Angus ; and so warmly urged his entreaty, that Beaton, suddenly striking his hand on his breast, declared on his conscience that they had no hostile intentions, or at least that he was"], [139, "1520. JAMES V. 133 ignorant of their existence. \" Alas, my lord,\" said Douglas, as the steel plates of Beaton's armour rung to the blow, \" I perceive your conscience clatters.\" The spirited appeal of Douglas, hoAvever, had nearly succeeded, and Sir Patrick Hamilton, the brother of the governor, had agreed to become umpire, when Hamilton of Finnart, a man distinguished for his ferocity, upbraided him Avith cowardice in declining the combat ; and pointed to the spearmen of Angus, who, being joined by a band of borderers under Home of Wedderburn, had arrayed themselves in a formidable phalanx upon, the causeway. It was a reproach which the proud spirit of Hamilton could not bear. \" Bastard smaik,\"1 said he, \" I shall fight this day where thou darest not be seen.\" Upon which he rushed into the street, folloAved by a few of his retainers, and threw himself sword in hand upon the ranks of the spearmen, whilst Angus, pressing forward, slew him on the spot, and fiercely assaulted his followers, most of whom fell pierced by the long pikes of the borderers ; all forbear ance was noAv at an end ; and the conflict becoming general, the party of Arran, after a fierce resistance, were entirely routed, the chief himself being chased out of the city, and Beaton compelled to fly for safety behind the high altar of the church of the Dominican convent.2 Even this sanctuary Avas not enough to screen him from the ferocity of the soldiers, who tore off his rocquet and would have slain him on the spot, but for the timely interference of his riATal prelate, the Bishop of Dunkeld.

The hatred of the queen-doAvager to her husband Angus, was noAV too deep to admit even the semblance of a reconciliation ; her temper, which partook of her brother's violence, resented his imperious mandates ; and as Dacre and Wolsey, who regarded Angus as the pillar of the English interest, began to treat her with coldness, Margaret, not unnaturally, was induced to look to France, in whose policy towards England a very sudden revolution now took place, in consequence of the election of Charles the Fifth to the imperial throne. The political treachery of Wolsey, AA'hose personal ambition had become incompatible Avith the continuance of his devotion to Francis, is well knoAvn to the student of European history ; and one of its immediate effects was the reconciliation of Albany and the queen-do Avager, Avho, by a letter under her own hand, entreated his return to Scotland,2 anticipating, by a union of their parties, the complete submission of the kingdom to their authority. It Avas even ru moured that Albany had employed his interest at the papal court to procure the queen's divorce from Angus, with the design of offering her his hand ; whilst a still more ridiculous report Avas circulated, of Avhich it is difficult to trace the origin, that the young king had been conveyed to England, and that the boy to Avhom royal honours were then paid in Stirling was a plebeian child, which had been substituted in his place. In the meantime Angus, Avhose nomination as one 1 Caligula, B. vi. 140. Instructions a Monr. Robert Estuard, Sei gneur D'Aubigny. 8 Caligula, B. ii. 195.

All things, therefore, seemed to urge upon the queen's party the necessity of immediate action ; and as the open accession of Henry the Eighth to the interests of the emperor, by dissolving the ties between that monarch and the French king, had removed every impediment to the departure of Albany, this nobleman set sail from France, and arrived in Scotland on the 19th of November, disembarking from the Gareloch in Lennox ; from thence he proceeded to Stirling,1 where he was immediately joined by the queen, and Avelcomed by that princess, whose affections Avere as violent as her resentments, with an indiscreet fami liarity, Avhich gave rise to reports injurious to her honour. Lord Dacre, in a letter to his sovereign, represents her as closeted with Albany, not only during the day, but the greater part of the night, and careless of all appearances ; whilst he refers his majesty to the Bishop of Dunkeld, then at the English court, for a confirmation of the intimacy Avhich existed between them.2 AVhatever truth Ave are to attach to these accusations, to which the character of the queen gives some countenance, the immediate effects of Albany's arrival were highly important.

In the letters addressed to his royal master and to Wolsey, he re presented the regent's intimacy Avith the queen as scandalous and adulterous : it was reported, he said, that they had endeavoured, by a high bribe, and in contemplation of their marriage, to induce Angus to consent to a divorce ; that Albany evidently looked to the throne ; and that some men did not scruple to affirm that the life of the young monarch was in 1 In a letter from Wolsey to Henry, November 1521, the secret and insidious policy of Henry towards Scotland is strikingly laid down. \" Nevertheless, to cause him not only to take a more vigilant eye to the demeanour of the Scots, as well within Scotland as without, and to be more diligent, hereafter, in writing to your grace and me, but also favourably to entertain the Homes and other rebels, after his accustomable manner, so that they may continue the divisions and sedition in Scotland, whereby the said Duke of Albany may, at his coming hither, be put in danger ; and though some money be employed for the entertainment of the said Homes and rebels, it will quit \"the cost at length.\" \u2014 State Papers, published by government, p. 91 ."], [145, "JAMES V. 1521. 139 danger. It may be conjectured, that, although Dacre repeats these as the rumours which had begun to cir culate amongst the people, he was himself the principal author from whom they emanated. Such were the secret practices by Avhich this busy political agent, and the creatures whom, on another occasion, he mentions as being in his pay, endeavoured to bring into disrepute the government of Albany ; but for the present they were too gross to be su c cessful The only portion of truth Avhich Avas to be found in them, related probably to the governor's intrigue with the queen, which the licentious manners of the times, and the well-known gallantries of that princess, ren dered by no means an improbable event. That Albany had any design of marriage, that he was ambitious of the royal power, or that he contemplated the atrocious crime by which he must have ascended the throne, are calumnies refuted by the whole tenor of his former and subsequent life. The best practical ansAver, indeed, to these imputa tions, was the success and popularity of his government. Angus, whose poAver had been too intolerable for the council of regency, with his adherents, Home and Somerville, were compelled to fly for security to the Kirk of Steyle, a retreat Avhose obscurity denotes the contempt into Avhich they had fallen. From this place they engaged in a negotiation with Henry, which was managed by the celebrated Douglas bishop of Dun keld, a keen and unscrupulous partisan of his nepheAv Angus.1 This prelate Avas empoAvered to visit Dacre 1 \" The Instructions and Commission for my Lord of Dunkeld to be shewen to the king's grace of England \" is a curious document. It is preserved in the British Museum, [Caligula, B. vi. 204,] and com mences with the following startling accusation : \"Item first, ye shall shaw how the Duk of Albany is come to Skotland, and throw his pretended title that he has to the crown, it is presumed, he havand the"], [146, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1521. 140 \u25a0 on his journey to England, and afterwards, in a per- sonal interview with Henry, to explain to that monarch the political state of Scotland, and the alleged excesses of the regent. These, there is reason to believe, he had every disposition to exaggerate ; and in consulting the original papers which he has left, and the diploma- tic correspondence of Lord Dacre, the historian who is anxious to arrive at the truth, must recollect that he is perusing the evidence of partisans Avho wrere entirely devoted to the English interest, and whose object it Avas to reduce the country under the complete control of the English monarch. It is, therefore, with some distrust that we must listen to the accusation brought against the regent of a profligate venality in the dis- posal of ecclesiastical patronage, Avhen we recollect his different conduct at a time when his actions could be closely watched, and the temptation was, perhaps, greater. To Dacre, Albany strongly remonstrated against the infractions of the truce, and the encourage- ment held out by Henry to those rebellious chiefs in Scotland, who had been cited to answer for their trea- sons before the great council of the nation ; whilst the English Avarden, Avithholding from Albany his title of regent, and addressing him simply as one of the coun- cil, retorted a complaint against the conduct of Lord Maxwell, who had refused to proclaim the peace, and permitted an invasion of the English borders. There can be no doubt that the accusations on both sides were well founded, as, in these times, from the fero- kepand of the king our soveran lord, your nephew, and the reull of his realme and subjects, [there] is grete suspicion and danger of his person ; wherefore, without hasty assistance, and help of the king's grace of England, it is thought to us that our soverain lord forsaid stands in gret jeapardie of his life.\" \u2014 See also the valuable volume of State Papers published by government, Part i. pp. 17, 18.

JAMES V. 141 cious habits of the borderers, nothing could be more difficult than to enforce the observation of a truce ; but the regent, who seems to have been sincere in his desire of peace, promised immediate redress, whilst Dacre, although he recommended his master the king to abstain from any abrupt declaration of wrar, craftily suggested a plan by which, through pensions granted to the English northern lords on condition of their invading the Scottish borders, he might distress the country even more than by avowed hostilities.1 He excited the animosity of the English king at the same time by informing him that, to the prejudice of the title of his royal nephew, the regent had assumed the style of majesty ; and he insinuated, from some expres sions which had been used by the Scottish governor, that his zeal in the office of lord warden might not improbably expose him to attempts against his life.2 In the meantime the Bishop of Dunkeld proceeded on his secret mission to Henry ; and the strength of Albany became so great, that, after an ineffectual endeavour to abide the tempest which awaited them, Angus and his partisans deemed it prudent to escape into England. It is unfortunate that the principal original records which remain of these troubled times, and from which we must extract the history of the second regency of Albany, are so completely the composition of partisans, and so contradictory of each other, that to arrive at the truth is a matter of no little difficulty. But in examining the impetuous measures adopted by Henry, the violent accusations against the goA'ernment of Albany which proceeded from Dacre and the Bishop of Dunkeld, and the animated, though partial, defence 1 Caligula, B. vi. 205, 206.

Soon after the flight of Angus, his uncle, the Bishop of Dunkeld, addressed a memorial to the English king, in which he bitterly arraigned the conduct of the regent, accusing him of reiterated acts of peculation, and alleging, that his avarice had proceeded so far as to have converted the royal robes and tapestries into dresses for his pages ; the young king, he affirmed, Avas kept in a state not only of durance, but of Avant ; the fortresses of the kingdom were garrisoned by Frenchmen ; the ecclesiastical benefices shamelessly trafficked for gold ; and the croAATn lands dilapidated by an usurper, who, he maintained, had no title to the regency : it having been expressly declared by the parliament, that should Albany remain more than four months in France, he should forfeit that high office. Margaret, on the other hand, despatched an enAroy to her brother, to wdiom she gave full instruc tions, written Avith her own hand, in which she con tradicted, in the most pointed terms, the distorted representations of the Bishop of Dunkeld. She de scribed the conduct of the regent as respectful and loyal ; he had in nothing interfered, she said, Avith the custody of the king, her son, who, by the permission of the lords whom the parliament had appointed his guardians, resided with herself in the castle of Edin burgh. She entreated Henry not to listen to the scandal which had been raised against her by a traitorous and unworthy prelate, Avho had forfeited his bishoprick, of which the governor had given her the disposal ; and she besought her brother not to imitate, in his present ansAver, the sternness of a former mes-"], [149, "JAMES V. 1522. 143 sage, but to give a favourable audience to her envoy, and a friendly construction to her remonstrances.1 Nothing, howeATer, could be farther from the mind of this monarch, who, giving himself up completely to the selfish policy of Wolsey, had resolved upon a war both with France and Scotland : he denounced his sister as the paramour of the governor; declared that he would listen to no terms until he had expelled this usurper from Scotland ; accused him of having stolen out of France, in defiance of the oath of the French king, which guaranteed his remaining in that country ; he despatched Clarencieux herald with a severe reprimand to the queen, and addressed, at the same moment, a message to the Scottish estates, which gave them no choice but the dismissal of Albany, or immediate hostilities Avith England. To this haughty communication the Scottish parliament replied with firmness and dignity. They derided the fears ex pressed by Henry for the safety of his nephew the king, and the honour of his sister, as idle, entreating him to refuse all credit to the report of such Scottish fugitives as abused his confidence : they reminded him that Albany had been invited by themselves to assume the regency ; that he had conducted himself in this office with all honour and ability, as clearly appeared by his discovering and defeating the iniqui tous designs of those traitors who had conspired to seize their youthful king, and transport him out of the realm ; and they declared, that hoAvever solicitous i 1 Caligula, B. vi. 208. 6th January, 1521-2.

He accordingly passed into France, where he appears to have devoted himself to such studies as rendered him, on his return, a more formidable oppo nent than he had ever yet been.2 Whilst the estates replied in this spirited manner to the proposal of Henry, neither they nor the governor could shut their eyes to the injurious consequences of a war with England.

JAMES V. 145 were the only means by which their country, worn out by long intestine commotions, could revive. They were, indeed, once more the allies of France, and the French monarch, against whom the emperor and Henry had now declared Avar, was anxious by every method to employ their arms in his favour ; but their eyes were now open to the sudden changes which were perpe tually taking place in European politics, and they had not forgotten the facility with which, on a late occasion, Francis had abandoned their interests when they became incompatible with his OAvn views of ambi tion. It was determined, therefore, to assemble an army, but to act on the defensive, and to make the best provision for the presentation of peace, by assum ing the attitude of war. To these calm and Avise counsels the violent conduct of Henry offered a striking contrast. He published a sentence of confiscation and banishment against all French and Scottish subjects who were resident in England, and insisted that the Scots should be driven from his dominions on foot, with a Avhite cross affixed to their upper garments. He commanded the Earl of Shrewsbury to raise the poAver of the northern coun ties ; and this leader, suddenly penetrating as far as Kelso, gave that beautiful district to the flames, but Avas repulsed with considerable loss by the borderers of Merse and Teviotdale. About the same time an English squadron appeared in the Forth, and, after ravaging the coast, returned Avithout opposition to the Thames ; a proof that, during this calamitous minority, the naval enterprise of the Scots had declined. It was impossible, however, that these outrages, which might be only preludes to more serious hostilities, could be overlooked ; and Albany having assembled a parliament at Edinburgh, it was resolved that war VOL. IV. k"], [152, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1522. 146 should be instantly declared against England. The young king, now in his eleventh year, was removed from the capital to Stirling castle, Lord Erskine, a peer of tried fidelity, being appointed his sole gover nor ; and letters Avere issued for the array of the Avhole feudal force of the kingdom. At this moment, Avhether induced by the promises of Dacre, or actuated by that capricious mutability in her affection which Margaret seems to have possessed in common with her brother Henry, the queen suddenly cooled in her attachment to the interests of the regent, and betrayed the whole secrets of his policy to the English warden ; becoming an earnest advocate for peace, and intriguing with the chiefs and nobles to support her views. It was now the period which had been appointed for the muster of the Scottish host; and Albany, at the head of a numerous and Avell appointed army, eighty thousand strong, and with a formidable train of artillery, advanced toAvards the English borders, and encamped at Annan. Neither party, however, were sincere or earnest in their desire of war. Henry wished to avoid it, from his anxiety to concentrate his undivided strength against France ; the Scottish governor, from a conviction that a Avar of aggression, although favourable to the interests of Francis, was an idle expenditure of the public strength and the public money. On commencing hostilities, therefore, both belligerents appear to have mutually intimated the condition on which they considered that the war might be speedily concluded. Henry had so far altered his tone as to insist simply on the stipulation that the King of Scots should be placed in the hands of faith ful guardians, without adding a word regarding the necessity of Albany's departure from the realm ; Avhilst the regent declared that he Avas ready to stay the"], [153, "1 522. JAMES V. 147 march of his army, under the single condition that France should be included in the treaty to be nego- tiated by the belligerents. The Scottish force, how- ever, advanced to Carlisle ; and as the flower of the English army was with their sovereign in France, an universal panic seized the northern counties, Avhich seems to have communicated itself to the desponding despatches of Wolsey ' but Dacre, who kneAV from the queen-dowager the aversion of the leaders to the war, and the pacific desires of the regent, immediately opened a correspondence with the governor, and, by a course of able negotiations, succeeded in prevailing upon him to agree to an abstinence of hostilities for a month, for the purpose of sending ambassadors into England. He then disbanded his army, Avithout striking any blow of consequence.1 It has been the fashion of the Scottish historians to arraign the con- duct of Albany on this occasion, as singularly pusil- lanimous and inglorious : but a little reflection will convince us that the accusation is unfounded. It had been the advice of Bruce, a master in the art of Scottish war, from whose judgment few will be ready to appeal, that, in maintaining their independence, the Scots should abstain from any lengthened or pro- tracted expedition against England ; that they should content themselves with harassing the enemy by light predatory inroads, and never risk a pitched battle, which, considering the inferior resources of the coun- try, might, even in the event of a victory, be ultimately fatal. By this counsel the regent was now wisely guided; and it ought not to be forgotten, that the obstinate neglect of it, in opposition to the remon strances of some of James's ablest commanders, had 1 Lesley, Bannatyne edit. p. 123. State Papers, p. 107. Wolsey to Henry the Eighth,"], [154, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 148 1522. brought on the defeat of Flodden, and the subsequent calamities of the country. Dacre and Shrewsbury were indeed unprepared to meet the Scots with a force at all equal to that which they led against him ; and had they been combating, as in the days of Bruce, for their national existence, it might have been a question, Avhether they ought not to have taken ad vantage of the opportunity, by wasting the country in a rapid inroad ; but now the circumstances Avere entirely changed. Albany, the queen, and the Scot tish nobles, were all equally desirous of peace. Aware of the folly of sacrificing their country to the ambition of France, the peers had declared to Dacre, that \" for no love, favour, or fair promises of the French king, would they in any wise attempt war against England, or invade that country:1 nothing but Henry's com mand that they should dismiss the regent from the country, and submit to his dictation, having compelled them to take arms.\" From this demand he now de parted. Dacre, in an altered tone, only stipulated that measures should be taken for the security of the young king : he promised an immediate truce, and to stay the advance of the English army ; to command a cessation of all hostilities on the borders, and to pro- cure a safe-conduct for the Scottish ambassadors to the court of England. It Avould have been unwise to have sacrificed such favourable terms to any idle ambition of conquest or invasion ; and the writers who have accused the regent, on this occasion, of Aveakness and infatuation, must have given an imperfect examina- tion to the peculiar and trying circumstances in which he was placed. Whilst it appears, however, that the conduct of Albany was undeserving the severity of 1 Caligula, B. vi. 256, dorso. Instructions by the king's highness to Clarencieux king at arms."], [155, "1522. JAMES V. 149 the censure with which it has been visited, it is not to be denied that Lord Dacre acted throughout with great political ability. I have digressed thus far in examining the conduct of the regent, because our more ancient historians have attributed the sudden peace to dissensions in the Scottish host ; whilst Pinkerton, and those who have folloAved his steps, trace it solely to the pusillanimity of Albany, both opinions being founded, as it appears to me, on erroneous grounds. On the dismissal of his army, Albany returned to the capital, and resumed the anxious labours of his regency : the queen, at the same time, with charac teristic caprice, continued her private correspondence with Dacre, betraying the secrets of the governor, and thus enabling him to defeat his measures by soAving dissensions amongst the nobles ; whilst the negotiations for continuance of the truce were brought to an abrupt termination, by Henry's decided refusal to include France within its provisions. Nothing, indeed, could be more irksome or complicated than the duties which on every side pressed upon the governor. His engage ments to France prompted him to hostilities Avith England ; his own opinion, and his attachment to his nephew the king, convinced him that peace was to be preferred, for the best interests of the kingdom com mitted to his care : he had none beside him upon whom he could place implicit reliance in the discussion of state affairs, or the execution of his designs. Many of the nobles were corrupted by the money of England : if he attempted to punish or detect them, they rebelled; if he shut his eyes to their excesses, his indulgence Avas interpreted into weakness ; and the queen dowager, by the junction of whose party with his oavu he had so lately succeeded iu putting his enemies to a precipitate flight, was not to be trusted for a moment."], [156, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1522. 150 It was, perhaps, the difficulties of his situation, and the impossibility of reconciling these various parties and interests, Avhich now induced him to meditate a visit to France for the purpose of a conference with Francis the First, in which he was no doubt solicitous to vindicate what must have appeared to that mo narch the culpability of his late inaction. About the same time the Earl of Shrewsbury, whose age incapa citated him for the activity of a military command, Avas removed, and Surrey, a nobleman of great vigour and ability, appointed chief warden of the borders ; Avhilst the Marquis of Dorset and the experienced Dacre acted under him as wardens of the east and west marches.1 The governor noAV appointed a council of regency, which consisted of the Archbishop of Glasgow chancellor, with the Earls of Huntley, Arran, and Argyle, to Avhom he added Gresolles, a French knight much in his confidence : he bound them by oath to attempt nothing which should weaken his authority f and promising to return within ten months, under the penalty of forfeiting his regency, he sailed for France, where he was received by the king wdth much respect and kindness. During his absence, the war, notwithstanding the assurances of Dacre and the promises of Henry to preserve peace, continued to rage with undiminished violence on the borders. The conduct of the English monarch, indeed, must have appeared intolerable to every one who contrasted it with his hollow profes sions of love to the person and government of his nepheAV.3 Dorset, the warden of the east marches, 1 Lesley, p. 123. 2 Caligula, B. ii. 327.

Yet Henry had but lately declared, by Clarencieux, Avhom, on the retirement of Albany, he had despatched into Scotland, that he considered the war unnatural, and Avas earnestly desirous to live at peace Avith his royal nepheAV. It is scarcely to be expected, that the intimation of such violent proceedings should not have inceused Albany ; and although out of the kingdom, and aware of the difficulty of persuading its divided nobility to any union, he determined to make a last effort to repel the insult offered to his government, and save the kingdom from being alternately wasted as a rebellious district, or administered as a province of England.1 To this he was the more inclined, as the extreme cruelty with Avhich the country had been wasted, had, my lords, the king's highness, my sovereign lord, bering tender zele to the good of peax, and specially with his derest nephew, and the Queen of Skotland hath sent me to know whether ye persever and continew in your vertuous intente and mynde towards the establiss ment of good peax betwix both the realms.\" Instructions to Claren cieux, an original corrected by the cardinal.

His claim, as a descendant of a sister of Edward the Fourth, had been supported by Francis the First, and it was now, with the object of disturbing the government of Eng land, espoused by Albany.2 On his arrival, the condition in which the regent found his affairs Avas far from encouraging. His for mer ally, the queen-dowager, had completely embraced the English interest, and was eagerly engaged in a negotiation with Dacre and Surrey, which threatened to change the whole aspect of affairs. It was proposed, with the object of flattering the princess, that her son, the young king, should solemnly assume the supreme power, whilst she, at the head of a council, should con duct the government ; and the correspondence upon this subject, although at this moment not conducted to a favourable termination, Avas not long after resumed Avith complete success. When Albany looked to the nobles, he discovered, that although willing to assemble an army for the defence of the borders, they were totally averse to an invasion upon a great scale, or to a war of continued aggression, in Avhich they argued, that for the sole object of obliging France, they could gain nothing, and might hazard all ; whilst, on turning to Surrey, the English commander, he found him Avith 1 Caligula, B. iii. 53.

JAMES V. 153 peace indeed upon his lips, yet by his whole conduct shoAving a determination for immediate war. We know, by a letter of this stern leader to Wolsey, that he had resolved to conduct such an invasion as should lay waste the Scottish border to the breadth of tAArelve miles, and reduce it for ever after to the state of an uninhabited desert.1 To these difficulties, which pressed him on every side, must be added the circumstance, that the regent had little experience in the peculiar system of Scottish war, but had been trained in the military school of Italy ; and that any designs which he attempted to form for the conduct of the campaign, Avere communicated to Surrey by the queen, Avhose conduct had made her contemptible in the eyes of both parties. With such complicated embarrassments, ultimate success could scarcely be expected ; but for the moment, Albany, whose coffers had been recently filled, and were liber ally opened, found the venality of the Scottish nobles a sure ground to work upon ; and even the queen, wdio at first had thoughts of retreating to England, Avas so dazzled by his presents, and Avon by his courtesies, that her allegiance to that country began to waArer ; nor did she scruple to inform the Earl of Surrey, that Henry must remit more money, else she might be induced to join the French interest.2 It Avas of material consequence to the regent that hostilities should instantly commence, as the foreign auxiliaries were maintained at a great expense, and the dispositions of the nobility were not to be trusted for any length of time. A parliament was assembled Avithout delay ; a proclamation issued for an array 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 217. Caligula, B. vi. 318-320. s Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 223. Caligula, B. vi. 380.

For the selfishness and venality of such conduct, little excuse can be pleaded ; and it is unfortunately too frequently to be found in the preceding and subsequent history of the Scottish aristocracy. MeanAvhile, all looked fair for the moment. On the day appointed, the army mustered in considerable strength on the Borough-muir, near Edinburgh. Argyle, indeed, delayed at Glasgow, for the purpose of assembling the Highlanders and Islesmen ; the Mas ter of Forbes did not hesitate to speak openly against the expedition ; and Huntley, one of the most powerful of the peers, excused himself by feigning indisposi tion : yet a respectable force assembled, amounting, in effective numbers, to about forty thousand men, not including camp followers, which, on such occasions, Avere always numerous. With this army, Albany ad vanced toAvards the borders ; whilst symptoms of an early winter darkened around him, and his march was 1 Caligula, B. iii. 57. Sir William Eure to Surrey.

JAMES V. 155 impeded by dragging his train of artillery through the rude and heavy roads of a country totally dissimilar from that in which they had been accustomed to act. The Scottish soldiers and their leaders became jeal ous of the foreign auxiliaries, who required much at tendance and consumed the best of every thing ; whilst the towns and burghs complained of the necessity im posed on them to furnish transports for their baggage. Owing to these causes, the march was slow, and indi cations of disorganization early began to exhibit them selves. Meanwhile, tidings arrived that Surrey had as sembled his host, which outnumbered Albany by a thousand men ; whilst the confidence they expressed in their leader, and the unanimity and discipline by Avhich they were animated, offered a striking contrast to their enemies. The whole army was eager to en gage in hostilities; but, till Albany commenced an offensive war, it was reported that Henry's orders confined their commander to defensive operations. This last rumour appears to have revived amongst the Scottish peers their former indisposition to invade England, and suggested the notion that the war might be yet avoided. It happened that the celebrated Buchanan Avas at this moment a volunteer in the army ; and the account of such an eye-witness is highly valuable. On arriving at Melrose, wdiere a wooden bridge was then thrown across the Tweed, murmurs of discontent began to break forth, which all the entreaties and remonstrances of Albany could not remove ; and these gathering force, soon proceeded to an open refusal to advance. It was Avith the great est difficulty that the regent, putting himself at their head, prevailed upon part of the van of the army to cross the bridge ; the rearward obstinately refused to"], [162, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1523. 156 follow ; 1 and soon after, the divisions which had passed over, turned their backs, and returned to the Scottish side. To struggle against such a determination Avas impossible ; and Albany, disgusted aud incensed with the treachery of men whose solemn promises were so easily forgotten, adopted perhaps the only other alternative ; and encamping at Eccles on the left bank of the TAveed, laid siege to Wark castle Avith his foreign troops and artillery. The description given by Buchanan' of this border fortress is valuable, as, with little variation, it presents an accurate picture of the Scoto-Norman castles of this period. It consisted of a high tower placed within an inner court, and sur rounded by a double Avail.

With their character istic spirit and ready valour the French easily carried the first court ; but the English setting fire to the booths, in which they had stoAved their farm produce, smoked the enemy out of the ground they had gained. The artillery then began to batter the inner wall, and effected a breach, through which the men-at-arms charged Avith great fury ; and had they received sup port from the Scots, there is little doubt the fortress Avould have been stormed ; but, on effecting a lodgment Avithin the court, so destructive a fire was poured in upon them from the ramparts, shot-holes, and narroAV windows of the great tower, which was still entire, that it was difficult for such a handful of men to maintain their ground : the assault, nevertheless, was continued till night ; and when darkness compelled 1 Buchanan's Hist, of Scotland, B. xiv. c. xxii."], [163, "1523. JAMES V. 157 them to desist, it was proposed to reneAV it next day.1 But it was now the 4th of November, the winter had set in, and a night of incessant snow and rain so flooded the river, that all retreat was threatened to be cut off. The assaulting party, therefore, recrossed the Tweed with the utmost speed, leaving three hundred slain, of which the greater number wrere Frenchmen, and once more joined the main body of the army.2 While these events occurred, Surrey was at Holy Island ; and on hearing of the attack on Wark castle, he issued orders for his army to rendezvous at Barmore Avood, within a few miles of Wark. The news of his speedy approach confirmed the Scottish nobles in their determination not to risk a battle. So completely had the majority of them been corrupted by the money and intrigues of Dacre and the queen-dowager, that Albany did not venture to place them in the front, but, on his march, formed his vanguard of the French auxiliaries; a proceeding rendered the more necessary by the dis covery of some secret machinations amongst the peers for delivering him, if he persisted in urging hostilities, into the hands of the enemy.3 To attempt to en counter Surrey with his foreign auxiliaries alone, Avould have been the extremity of rashness, and to abide the advance of the English Earl Avith an army Avhich re fused to fight, must have exposed him to discomfiture and dishonour : under such circumstances, the regent, whose personal courage and military experience had been often tried on greater fields, adopted, or rather had forced upon him, the only feasible plan which remained. At the head of his artillery and foreign auxiliaries, the 1 Caligula, B. vi. 304-306. Surrey to the king. 8 Buchanan, Book xiv. c. xxi. xxii. Lesley, Bannatyne edit. p. 125. 1 Caligula, B. i. 281.

When carefully examined, we must arrive at an opposite conclusion. The retreat of Albany is only one other amongst many facts, which establish the venality and selfishness of the feudal aristocracy of Scotland, and the readiness Avith wdiich they consented, for their OAvn private ends, to sacrifice their individual honour and the welfare of the country ; nor, in this point of view is it unim portant to attend to some remarkable expressions of Surrey, which occur in a letter addressed to his sove reign. They furnish not only an instructive commen tary ou Henry's alleged anxiety for the welfare of the kingdom of his nephew, but demonstrate the folly of those ideas which, it is probable, guided some of the Scottish leaders \u2014 that an abstinence from hostilities upon their part avouM be attended by corresponding moderation on the side of Surrey.

On his return to the capital, the governor assembled a parliament, of which the proceedings were distracted by mutual accusations and complaints. The peers accused the regent of squandering the public treasure, although the greater part of the money Avhich he had brought from France had found its way in the shape of pensions into their own coffers, or had been neces sarily laid out in the support of the foreign auxiliaries. They insisted on dismissing the French troops, Avhose farther residence was expensive; and, notwithstanding the inclement season of the year, compelled them to embark : an ungenerous proceeding, which led to the wreck of the transports on the shores of the Western Isles, and the loss of great part of their crews.2 To Albany, such conduct was mortifying in the extreme : it convinced him, that every effort must fail to persuade such men to adopt the only line of conduct AA7hich was likely to render the government respected, and to free the country from the dictation of England. He de termined, therefore, once more to retire to France ; and, in a conference Avith the nobility, requested three months' leave, in which he might visit that kingdom, and discover what further assistance might be expected from the French king, in carrying on the Avar with England. His demand, after much opposition, was granted, under the condition, that if he did not return on the 31st of August, the league with France, and his own regency, should be considered at an end : 3 but 1 \" And hath made suche waste and spoil in his own countre, that they shall not recover these seven years.\" Surrey to Henry the Eighth.

A loan of forty thousand crowns was positively refused him; and the lords consented with an ill grace to the high and confidential office of treasurer being given, during his absence,1 to Gresolles, the same knight who had been added to the council of regency in 1522. These arrangements being completed, and having prevailed on the parliament to intrust the keeping of the king's person to the Lords Cassillis, Fleming, Borthwick, and Erskine, he took an affectionate leave of his youthful soA-ereign, and sailed for the continent, com mitting the chief management of affairs to the chan cellor, Avith the Bishop of Aberdeen, and the Earls of Huntley and Argyle.2 On quitting the kingdom, Albany asserted that his absence would not exceed three months ; but it is probable, that his repeated reverses in a thankless office had totally disgusted him both with Scotland and the regency ; and that, when he embarked, it was with the resolution, Avhich he fulfilled, of never returning to that country. 1 Lord Dacre to Cardinal Wolsey. 3 1st May, 1524.

For the last two years, the Earl of Angus, who had formerly shown himself so cordial a friend of England had resided in France, whence Henry the Eighth, de- sirous of employing him in his designs for embroiling the government of Albany, had secretly called him into his dominions. It was now esteemed the moment when his presence in Scotland might once more rein- state the English faction, which had been long gaining strength, in undisputed power; and the earl, whose foreign residence had increased his experience and talent, but not improved his patriotic feelings, at once lent himself to the projects of Henry. During his banishment, he had corresponded Avith that monarch : although an exile, he had made himself master of the political divisions and intrigues by Avhich the kingdom was distracted ; and having agreed upon his plan of operations, he accelerated his preparations for his return to his native country. Before, hoAvever, this project could be put into execution, the departure of VOL. IV. L"], [168, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1524. 162 the regent had given rise to a revolution, which, for a season, totally changed the aspect of public affairs. In this, the chief actors were Margaret the queen-dowager, and the Earl of Arran ; whilst its sudden and startling success seems to prove, that the project had been gra dually matured, and only waited for the departure of Albany to bring it into effect. The young king had now entered his thirteenth year, and already gave pro mise of that vigour of character which aftenvards distinguished him. His mother, no longer controlled by the presence of a superior, determined to place him upon the throne ; a scheme which, by the assistance of England, she trusted, might be easily accomplished ; Avhilst Henry was ready to lend himself to the design, from the persuasion that the royal power, though ostensibly in the king, would be truly in the hands of a council overruled by England. Surrey, therefore, remained in the north, to overawe any opposition, by the terror of an immediate invasion ; and Margaret, having gained to her interest the peers to whom the person of the sovereign had been intrusted, suddenly left the palace of Stirling, and, accompanied by her son and a small retinue, proceeded to Edinburgh, which she entered amid the joyful acclamations of the popu lace. The procession, which, besides the queen-mother and her train, consisted of the Earls of Arran, Lennox, Crawford, and others of the nobility, moved on to the palace of Holyrood, Avhere a council was held, the king declared of age, and proclamations instantly issued in his name. He then formally assumed the government ; the peers tendered their oaths of allegiance ; and many, as well of the spiritual as temporal estate, entered into a solemn agreement, by which they abjured the en- gagements which had been made to Albany, declared his regency at an end, and promised faithfully to main-"], [169, "1524. JAMES V. 163 tain the supreme authority of their sovereign against all Avho might dare to question it.1 Against this extraordinary act, of Avhich the real object on the part of Henry could not be concealed, and over which the capricious character of the queen, alternately swayed by the most violent resentments or partialities, threw much suspicion, the only dissentient voices were those of the Bishops of St Andrews and Aberdeen. They contended that to confer the supreme poAver upon a boy of twelve years old was ridiculous ; that to remove him from the governors to whom his education had been intrusted, and plunge him at once in his tender years into the flatteries and vices of a court, must be certain ruin ; and they reminded the nobles of their promises so lately pledged to the Duke of Albany, to whom the regency at this moment un questionably belonged. For this bold and honest conduct they were by the queen's party immediately committed to prison ; nor could the offer from Wolsey of a cardinal's hat induce Beaton to renounce his pro mises to Albany, or become the tool of England.2 The news of the success of this revolution, Avhich in its rapidity had anticipated the wishes of Henry, Avas received Avith the utmost satisfaction in England.3 A guard of two hundred men-at-arms was immediately 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 238.

In return, she earnestly remonstrated against Henry's permitting the return of Angus into Scotland, not without a threat that, should her request be over looked, she would find another support than that of England. She demanded, at the same time, a pension and the order of the garter for Arran, and declared that without greater supplies it would be impossible for her to defray the charges of the government. In the meantime, a full account of these changes was transmitted by Gresolles, the captain of Dunbar, to the Duke of Albany; and a truce having been concluded for three months with England, it was determined that Dr Magnus, a person of great acuteness and diplomatic experience, should proceed as ambassador to Scotland. He was accompanied by Roger Ratcliffe, a gentleman of the privy chamber, whose agreeable and polished manners Avould, it was expected, have a favourable in fluence on the young king. In the midst of these transactions, the sincerity of the queen became suspected. Her late demands were considered too peremptory and covetous, and the coun tenance shown to Angus at the English court in no small degree alienated her affections from her brother ; nor Avas her personal conduct free from blame. With a volatility in her passions which defied the voice of reproof, or the restraints of decency, she had now be come enamoured of Henry Stewart, the second son of Lord Evandale, and in the ardour of her new passion raised him to the responsible office of treasurer. - The people had hitherto regarded her Avith respect, but"], [171, "JAMES V. 1524. 165 they no longer restrained their murmurs : Lennox and Glencairn, Avho had warmly supported her in the late revolution, left the capital in disgust ; and Arran, who had never ceased to look to the regency of Scotland as his right, and in whose character there was a strange mixture of weakness and ambition, though he still acted along with her, held himself in readiness to support any party Avhich promised to forward his OAvn views. Whilst this earl and the queen continued to receive the money of England for the support of the guards, and the maintenance of their private state, they deemed it prudent to open a negotiation with Francis the First, then engaged in preparations for his fatal expedition into Italy. That monarch received their envoy with distinction : professed his anxiety to maintain the an cient alliance between the kingdoms : reminded them of the intended marriage between the Scottish king and his daughter, and declared, that Angus having secretly escaped from his dominions, without asking his permission, or that of Albany, Avas undoubtedly animated by hostile intentions, and ought to be treated as a fugitive and a rebel.1 He addressed also a letter to the queen, in Avhich he besought her to adopt such measures as must secure the true interests of her son. But Margaret's blinded attachment to Henry Stewart, upon Avhose youth she had noAV bestoAved the high office of chancellor, and Arran's devotion to his own interests, effectually estranged from both the attachment of the nobles, who found themselves excluded from all in fluence in the government. They, indeed, as well as the queen, were in the pay of England ; and to such a degree of organization had the system of bribery and private information been carried, that Avhilst the Duke 1 Caligula, B. vi. 411.

The faction, however, contained within itself the seeds of its disunion ; for whilst the queen and Arran dreaded the poAver of Angus, and warmly remonstrated against his return, the peers of the party who found themselves neglected in the administration, looked to this event as the most probable means of recovering the impor tance which they had lost. It was in this state of things that Wolsey, who began to find that Margaret and Arran would not be sufficiently subservient to Eng land, entered into a secret agreement with Angus,2 in Avhich that peer, on condition of his being permitted to enter Scotland, stipulated to support the English in terest in that country and the government of James, equally against the open hostility of Albany, and the intrigues of the faction of the queen, which, from the venality and insolence of its measures, seemed to be rapidly hastening its ruin. An attempt was first made to reconcile Margaret to her husband, which completely failed ; and symptoms appearing of a coalition between the party of Albany, and that of Arran and the queen, Angus was no longer detained by Henry ; but, after an exile of two years, with increased ambition and 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 246.

At the same time the English ambassadors, Dr Magnus and Ratcliffe, arrived at the capital ; and a complicated scene of intrigue and diplomacy commenced, into the minuter particulars of which it would be tedious to enter. The scene which presented itself was indeed pitiable. It exhibited a minor sovereign deserted by those who owed him allegiance and support, whilst his kingdom Avas left a prey to the rapacity of interested counsellors, and exposed to the attacks of a powerful neighbour, Avhose object it was to destroy its separate exis tence, and reduce it to the condition of a dependent province. When we look more narrowly into its condition, we find that three great parties or factions at this moment distracted the minority of James. The first Avas that of Albany the late regent, supported by the influence of France, and conducted, during his absence, by the talents and vigour of the chancellor Beaton : of the second, the leaders were, the Earl of Arran, and the queen-mother, in whom the present power of the state resided, and Avho possessed the custody of the king's person : Avhilst at the head of the third was Angus, Avho had sold himself to the English government. The secret treaty, however, betAveen this peer and Henry, was unknown in Scotland ; and so great was the affection of the people for the house of Douglas, Avith Avhose history they associated so much chivalrous enterprise and national glory, that on his arrival in his native country, he was received by all ranks Avith joy and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Wolsey's jealousy of the Queen of Scots became confirmed, wdien he found that the Bishop of Aberdeen and the chancellor, Beaton, were set at liberty, and perceived the party"], [174, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1524. 168 of Albany once more rising into a dangerous impor tance. Such was the state of affairs on the arrival of Angus in Scotland ; and his improvement in judgment was seen by the moderation of his first measures. He addressed to the queen a submissive letter, professing his attachment to his sovereign, and his anxiety to do him service; he abstained from showing himself at court ; and, although able to command an army of vassals, he travelled with a modest retinue of forty horse, in obedience to an order of the government. These quiet courses, however, produced no effect on Margaret, whose ancient love to Angus had long before this turned into determined hatred ; whilst, with a contempt of all decency, she made no secret of her passion for Henry SteAvart, intrusting to his weak and inexperienced hands the chief guidance of affairs. Magnus, the English ambassador, attempted, but with equal want of success, to effect a reconcilia tion between her and her husband. The continuance of the pensions, the support of the English guard of honour, the present of a considerable sum for the exigencies of the moment, and, lastly, the promise of a matrimonial alliance between her son and the Princess Mary, were artfully held out as inducements to con sent to a pacification, and to abandon her opposition to Angus. Margaret was immoveable ; and, avowing her venality, she did not scruple to assign as her chief motive, that, in the event of a treaty of peace with England, the kingdom, by which we may understand herself and Arran, would lose the annual remittance of Francis, Avhich amounted to forty thousand francs.1 Thus thwarted in his application to the queen, Magnus, 1 Caligula, B. i. 285-290, inclusive.

It Avas determined, therefore, that a sudden blow should be struck, which might at once punish her obstinacy, and ensure the pre-eminence of the English interest. A parliament having assembled at Edinburgh, the distracted condition of the government, and the ex pediency of an immediate embassy to England, pre paratory to a general peace, came before the three estates. In one measure all parties seemed to agree. Albany's regency, in consequence of his continued absence, was declared at an end, and a committee of 1 Caligula, B. vi. 333.

Such was the state of matters, and the par liament had noAV sat for a week, Avhen, on the 23d of November, before daylight, an alarm was heard at the walls of the capital, and a party of armed men, fixing their scaling-ladders on the parapet, made good their entrance into the town, after which, Avith shouts and acclamations, they opened the gates to their com panions. It Avas now discovered that this force, Avhich amounted only to four hundred men, was led by the Earls of Angus and Lennox ; Scott of Buccleuch, the Master of Kilmaurs, and other chiefs, had joined them ; and as daylight broke they advanced fearlessly to the Cross, and proclaimed that they came as faithful sub jects to the king's grace. They next proceeded to the council of regency, which had assembled in great alarm, and repeating the same assurance, declared that the young king Avas in the hands of evil disposed persons, Avho were compassing their ruin and that of the whole nobility ; wherefore they required them to assume the custody of their monarch, and exercise the chief rule in the government.1 During these proceedings, the castle, which was in the hands of the queen's party, began to open its fire upon the town, Avith the object of expelling Angus ; and in the midst of the thunder of its artillery, and the shouts of the infuriated parti sans, a deputation, consisting of the Bishop of Aber deen, the Abbot of Caoibuskenneth, and Magnus the English ambassador, hurried to the palace, where they found the queen, and some lords of her party, 1 Magnus and Roger Ratcliffe to the Lord Cardinal.

On their arrival, Margaret consented to receive the bishop and his associate, but she per emptorily ordered Magnus to begone to his lodging, and abstain from interfering in Scottish affairs ; a mandate which that cautious civilian did not think it prudent to disobey. Meanwhile the fire of the for tress continued, and the peaceful citizens fell victims to the unprincipled efforts of two hostile factions. The conduct of Angus, hoAvever, was pacific; his folloAvers abstained from plunder ; no blood was shed, although they met Avith various peers with Avhom they were at deadly feud ; and upon a proclamation, commanding him, in the king's name, to leave the city, he retired to Dalkeith towards dusk. After dark, the queen, taking with her the young king, proceeded by torchlight to the castle, and dismissing all the lords, except Moray, who was devoted to the French interest, shut herself up in the fortress, and meditated some determined measures against her ene mies.1 Although there is no decisive evidence of the fact, there appears a strong presumption that this attack upon the queen was preconcerted by English influence, and probably not Avholly unexpected by Beaton the chancellor.

Alarmed at so sudden a turn of affairs, the queen and Arran hastened to appease Henry by an embassy, of wdiich the purpose was to treat of an immediate pacification, upon the basis of the proposed marriage between the young king and the Princess Mary.2 As a further means of accomplishing this, Marchmont herald was despatched to France, with the announcement that the regency of Albany had been formally declared at an end, and a remonstrance was addressed to Francis against the injurious consequences which too steady an attention to his interests had brought upon the commerce of Scotland.3 These measures, if adopted some time before this, might have been attended with the recovery of her influence by the queen ; but they came too late : their sincerity was suspected ; and al though Margaret continued to retain possession of the king's person, whom she kept in the castle of Edin burgh, the Earl of Angus and the chancellor Beaton already wielded an equal if not a superior authority, and had succeeded in attaching to themselves not only the great majority of the nobility, but the affections of the citizens : they were supported also by the English influence ; and it became at length evident to the haughty spirit of the queen, that to save the total 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 254.

The situation of the country, which was the theatre of constant rapine and assassination, called loudly for a settled administration ; the nation were disgusted with the sight of two factions who fulminated against each other accusations of treachery and rebellion. Such was the prodigality of the queen, who squan dered the royal revenues upon her pleasures, that Avhen the English monarch Avithdrew the pensions which had hitherto supported her administration, and recalled the guard which waited on the sovereign, the necessi ties of the state became urgent, and the palace and the court were left in poverty. Under such circumstances, it was absolutely necessary that some decisive step should be adopted by Angus and the chancellor, and, in a meeting of the principal lords of their party, held at St Andrews, a declaration was drawn up, which called upon all Avho were interested in the good of the common weal, to interfere for the establishment of its independence and that of the young king. They re presented the sovereign as imprisoned by an iniquitous faction in an unhealthy fortress, exposed to the unwholesome exhalations of the lake by which it was surrounded, and incurring additional danger from the reiterated commotions of the capital.1 They protested 1 Caligula, B. vi. 394.

These were bold measures ; but the queen deter mined to make yet one effort for the confusion of her enemies. She appealed to England, flattered Henry by a pretended acquiescence in his designs, urged the accomplishment of the marriage between her son and the princess, and earnestly requested the advance of the Duke of Norfolk with ten thousand men to the borders ; she next assembled the few peers who re mained with her in the castle, expatiated on the arrogance of their opponents, and implored them to raise their followers, and give battle to the enemy. But Henry suspected her sincerity ; the peers dreaded the insolence of her new favourite, Henry Stewart; and she discovered, with the deepest mortification, that from neither could she expect any thing like cordial support.

Magnus, the acute minister of Henry, had from the first suspected the sincerity of the queen, and within a short period her duplicity Avas completely detected.2 The very day on which the agreement with the peers and her husband was concluded, she opened a secret negotiation with Albany, acknowledged his authority as regent, professed a devotion to the interests of France, denounced as ignominious the idea of a peace with England, declared that she would leave Scotland sooner than consent to a sincere reconciliation with Angus, and eagerly requested the interest of Francis and Albany to accelerate at the Roman court her process of divorce.

Nothing could be more unhappy than the condition of Scotland, torn by domestic dissension, exposed to the miseries of feudal anarchy, with a nobility divided amongst themselves, and partly in the pay of a foreign power; a minor monarch whose education was ne glected, and his caprices or prepossessions indulged, that he might be subservient to his interested guardians; a clergy amongst whom the chief prelates were devoted to their worldly interests ; and a people who, whilst they groaned under such manifold oppressions, were yet prevented by the complicated fetters of the feudal system from exerting their energies to obtain redress. All was dark and gloomy: the proposal of a lengthened peace with England, and a marriage between the king and the Princess Mary, appeared to be the single means Avhich promised to secure any thing like tranquillity; and this measure, if guarded so as to a prevent a too exclusive exertion of foreign influence, might have been attended with the happiest results ; yet such was the infatuation of the queen-mother, that she gave the match her determined opposition, and, by her influence with her son, implanted an aversion to it in his youth ful mind. It Avas not to be expected that the characteristic impetuosity and haughtiness of Henry should brook such conduct; and he addressed to his sister a letter so replete Avith reproaches, that, on perusing it, she burst into tears, and bitterly complained that the style of the king was more fit for some vulgar railer, than to be employed by a monarch to a noble lady.1 Yet terrified by its violence, and convinced that her parti sans were gradually dropping aAvay, she replied in a 1 Caligula, B. vii. 3.

So deep, indeed, were her suspicions of Angus and the chancellor, with whom she had lately entered into an agreement, that she refused to trust her person in the capital, Avhere her presence in a parliament Avas necessary as president of the council of state ; and as the recent truce with England could not be proclaimed without her ratification, the country was on the point of being exposed to the ravages of border war. It was therefore determined, that the deed should be effectual without this solemnity ; and irritated by this last indignity, she attempted a secret negotiation with the queen-mother of France, who, upon the captivity of her son in the battle of Pavia, had succeeded to the regency. Even this resource failed her, for by this time Wolsey had quarrelled with the emperor, and, according to those selfish views by which his public policy was often directed, had pre vailed upon his royal master to conclude a treaty with France ; a death-blow to the hopes of the Scottish queen, and the prospects of the French faction. In the proceedings of the same parliament, there occurs a strong indication of the increase of the principles of the Reformation ; and we learn the important fact, that the books of Luther had made their way into Scotland, and excited the jealousy of the church. It was enacted, that no merchants or foreigners should dare to bring into the realm, which had hitherto firmly persevered in the holy faith, any such treatises, on pain of imprisonment and the forfeiture of their ships and cargoes; and it Avas enjoined, that all persons who publicly professed such doctrines, should be liable to the same penalties.1 An embassy now proceeded to England ; a truce 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 295.

A feeble attempt was indeed made by Arran, to prevent by force the rati fication of the truce ; and for a moment the appearance of a body of five thousand men, which advanced to Linlithgow, threatened to plunge the country into war: but the storm AAras dissipated by the promptitude of Douglas. Taking the king along with him, and sup ported by the terror of the royal name, he instantly marched against the rebels, who, without attempting to oppose him, precipitately retreated and dispersed.1 At this moment the country, so long distracted by the miseries of border Avar and internal anarchy, en joyed something like a prospect of tranquillity. A pacification of three years had been concluded with England ;2 and this was an important step towards the marriage which had been lately contemplated between the young king and the Princess Mary. The alliance between England and France had destroyed, for the moment, the French party in Scotland, and removed that fertile source of misery which arose to that country out of the hostilities of these great rivals; the anxiety of Henry to accomplish a reconciliation betAveen Angus and his sister the queen was sincere; and if Margaret had consented to a sacrifice of her private feelings, it would have probably been attended Avith the best effects. Magnus, whose prolonged resi dence in the capital as the envoy of England was disliked by the people, had, by his departure, removed this cause of enmity ; and the able Lord Dacre, whose intrigues for so many years had sown disunion and 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 271.

Blinded by her attachment to Stewart, Margaret would not for a moment listen to the pro posal of a reunion Avith her husband ; and he, who desired it not from any affection, but Avith the motive of possessing himself of her large estates, renounced all desire of reconciliation the moment he discovered that the council would withhold their consent from such a project. The divorce accordingly was pronounced with that mischievous facility which marked the pro stitution of the ecclesiastical law ; and scarcely was the sentence passed, when Margaret precipitately wedded her paramour, Henry Stewart, who disdained to ask the consent of the king, or to communicate the event to his chief ministers. Incensed at this presumption in an untitled subject, the lords of the council, in the name of the king, sent Lord Erskine with a small military force to Stirling, where the queen resided ; and the princess was compelled to deliver up her hus- 1 This able and busy lord, whose MS. correspondence, first opened by the acute Pinkerton, presents the most interesting materials for the history of this period, is entitled to the equivocal merit of being the inventor of that policy which was afterwards carried to perfection by the sagacious Burghley under Elizabeth : the policy of strengthen ing the government of his sovereign by the organized system of cor ruption, bribery, and dissensions, which he encouraged in the sister kingdom ; he died 25th October, 1525.

This scheme was now at an end, and its discomfiture drove him upon new and more violent courses. His authority in the capital, and throughout the whole of the south of Scotland, was immense. Since the marriage of the queen, he had effected a union with Arran and his adherents, \u2014 a party Avhich, in feudal dignity and vassalage, was scarcely inferior to his own : he was warden of the marches, an office of great authority ; and his place as one of the council of state gave him, according to the act of a recent parliament, a command over the person of the young king, which he had employed with great success to win his boyish affections. The party of Albany had gradually dis appeared ; the queen, since her marriage, had fallen into contempt : Lennox, one of the most powerful of the peers, had become a firm ally of Angus ; and nothing but the authority of the secret council, which resided chiefly in the chancellor Beaton, stood between the earl and the entire command of the state. In these circumstances, an artful stroke of Douglas's enabled him at once to reach the summit of his ambition. The king had noAV completed his fourteenth year, a period when, by the law of the country, his majority as an independent sovereign commenced. The event took place in April ; and between this period and the month 1 Lesley, p. 133. Caligula, B. vii. 29.

On the 13th of that month, a parliament assembled at Edinburgh ; and an ordinance was suddenly passed, Avhich declared that the minority of the sovereign was at an end, that the royal prerogative noAV rested solely in the hands of the king, who had assumed the govern ment of the realm, and that all other authority which had been delegated to any person whatever was annulled ; 1 a measure against which, as it was founded apparently on the most substantial legal grounds, neither the chancellor nor the secret council could protest, but which in one moment destroyed their power. But although the statute which gave the powers of the government to the secret council Avas annulled, the act of the three estates, which intrusted the keeping of the king's person to certain peers in rotation, remained in force : of these Angus Avas one ; and this crafty statesman had taken care to convene the parlia ment at the precise time, Avhen, by a former act, it belonged to himself and the Archbishop of GlasgoAv to assume the guardianship of the king; so that this new resolution of the three estates evidently placed the supreme power in the hands of him wdio had the custody of the sovereign. It was an able stroke of policy, but it could not have occurred under any other than a feudal government. To masque this usurpation, a new secret council was appointed, consisting chiefly of the friends of Angus, and including the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Prelates of Aberdeen and Galloway, the Earls of Argyle, Mor ton, Lennox, and Glencairn, with the Lord MaxAvell, whose advice, it was declared, his grace the sovereign Avill use for the welfare of the realm ; but it w7as shortly 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 301.

The ancient tyranny of the house of Douglas now once more shot up into a strength which rivalled, or rather usurped, the royal power ; the borders became the scene of tumult and confusion, and the insolence of the numerous vassals of this great family was intoler able. Murders, spoliations, and crimes of varied enormity, were committed with impunity. The arm of the law, paralyzed by the power of an unprincipled faction, did not dare to arrest the guilty : the sources of justice were corrupted ; ecclesiastical dignities of high and sacred character became the prey of daring intruders, or were openly sold to the highest bidder ; and the young monarch, who was watched with the utmost jealousy and rigour, began to sigh over a captivity, of which he could not look for a speedy termination. 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 307.

JAMES V. 183 Such excesses at length roused the indignation of the kingdom ; and Lennox, one of the most honest of the peers, secretly seceded from Angus. It was now the middle of summer, and as the Armstrongs had broken out into their usual excesses on the borders, Angus, with the young king in his company, conducted an expedition against them, wdiich was attended Avith slight success. Before this, however, James had con trived to transmit a secret message to Lennox and the Laird of Buccleuch, a potent vassal of that house, which complained bitterly of the durance in which he was held by the Douglases ; and as the royal cavalcade was returning by Melrose to Edinburgh, Walter Scott of Buccleuch suddenly appeared on a neighbouring height, and, at the head of a thousand men, threAV himself be tween Angus and the route to the capital.1 Douglas instantly sent a messenger, who commanded the border chief, in the royal name, to dismiss his followers ; but Scott bluntly answered, that he knew the king's mind better than the proudest baron amongst them, and meant to keep his ground, and do obeisance to his sovereign, who had honoured the borders with his presence.2 The answer was meant and accepted as a defiance, and Angus instantly commanded his fol lowers to dismount ; his brother George, Avith the Earls of Maxwell and Lennox, forming a guard round the young king, retired to a little hillock in the neigh bourhood, whilst the earl, with Fleming, Home, and Ker of Cessford, proceeded with levelled spears, and at a rapid pace, against Buccleuch, Avho also awaited them on foot. His chief followers, however, were out laAved men of the borders, whose array offered a feeble resistance tothe determined chargeof the armed knights 1 Lesley, p. 134. 8 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 330."], [190, "184 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1526. belonging to Angus ; the conflict, accordingly, was short : eighty of the party of Buccleuch were slain, the chief Avas compelled to retire, and, on the side of the Douglases, the only material loss Avas the death of Ker of Cessford, a brave baron, who Avas lamented by both parties.1 Not long after this, another and more determined effort to rescue the king from his ignominious thraldom was made by Lennox, who, it was privately suspected, had encouraged the attempt of Buccleuch. Having leagued himself Avith the chancellor and the queen, this nobleman advanced to Stirling at the head of an army of ten thousand men, whilst, with the hope of conciliating his hostility, the Douglases' despatched against him his uncle Arran, who commanded a superior force. The mission, however, was vain : Lennox declared, that he would enter the capital and rescue his sovereign, or die in the attempt. Arran instantly despatched a messenger to Angus, then at Edinburgh; Avho, commanding the trumpets to sound, displayed the royal banner, and, unable to restrain his im patience, pushed on towards Linlithgow, leaving the king to follow, under the charge of his brother, Sir George Douglas. It was on this occasion that a slight circumstance occurred Avhich produced after wards important effects, and marked the ferocious manners of the times. The young monarch, who Avas fond of Lennox, and kneAv that he had taken arms from affection to his person, advanced sloAvly and un- Avillingly, and was bitterly reproached for his delay by Douglas. On reaching Corstorphine, the distant sound of the artillery announced the commencement of the battle, and his conductor urging speed, broke 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 312."], [191, "1526.

Yet they made good their passage, and some squadrons, as they pressed up the opposite bank, attacked the army of Arran with great gallantry ; but their array had been broken, they found it impossible to form, and were already giving way, when the terrible shout of \"Douglas,\" rose from the advancing party of Angus, and the rout became complete.2 Lennox himself fell amongst the foremost ranks ; and Arran, a man of a gentle and affectionate nature, was found kneeling beside the bleeding body of his uncle, Avhich he had covered with his cloak, and passionately exclaiming, that the victory had been dearly purchased by the death of the Avisest and bravest knight in Scotland.3 The triumph of Angus was great ; his power Avas con solidated by the total failure of the coalition against it, and the chains of the young king appeared more firmly riveted than ever. It Avas hardly to be expected that the Douglases Avould use their success Avith moderation, or neglect the opportunity it offered to destroy effectually the 1 Buchanan, xiv. 28. 2 Lesley, p. 136. 3 Lindsay, 215"], [192, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1526. 186 power of their enemies. They accordingly made a rapid march to Stirling, with the intention of seizing the queen and the chancellor ; but both had fled, and Beaton found the pursuit so hot, that he was com pelled for some time to assume the disguise of a shepherd, and to conceal himself in the mountains till the alarm was over.1 The distress of the young king was great on hearing of the death of Lennox, and it rose to a feeling of the deepest resentment, when he discovered that after he had surrendered, he was murdered in cold blood by Hamilton the bastard of Arran, a ferocious partisan of Angus. On hearing that the day was going against him, James had sent forward Sir Andrew Wood, with earnest entreaties that his life might be spared ; but, in the rejoicings for their victory, his humanity Avas treated with deri sion by the Douglases, whose triumph soon after seemed complete, wdien Henry the Eighth despatched his letters to offer them his congratulations on their late successes, with his best advice for the education of his nephew, and the entire destruction of their enemies.2 Upon this last point Angus scarcely needed instruc tion ; and having convoked a parliament, he proceeded, with no gentle hand, to the work of spoliation and vengeance. It was first declared, that his and Arran's proceedings in the late rebellion of Lennox, were under taken for the good of the king, and the safety of the commonwealth ; and this act was followed by the for feiture of the estates of the insurgent lords. To Arran were presented the lands of Cassillis and Evandale ; to Sir George Douglas the estate of Stirling of Keir, who had been slain ; whilst Angus took for himself the 1 Lindsay, 217. 2 Caligula, B. vii. 67, 69.

To the queen-mother, for whom the king had become a suppliant, he behaved with moderation. She was invited to the capital, welcomed on her ap proach by her son, who met her Avith a numerous retinue, permitted to converse with him familiarly, and received Avith courtesy by Angus, a conduct adopted out of respect to Henry the Eighth, and which shoAved that her power was at an end. Beaton the chancellor had, in the meantime, by large gifts and the sacrifice of the abbey of Kilwinning, made his peace with his enemies, and counted himself happy in being permitted to retire from court ; whilst Arran, the successful col league of Angus, becoming a prey to the most gloomy remorse for the death of Lennox, shut himself up in one of his castles, and declined all interference in matters of state. The government was thus abandoned to an undivided despotism, and the tyranny of the house of Douglas became every day more intolerable to the nation. To bear the name was esteemed sufficient to coA-er the most atrocious crime, even in the streets of the capital : and, during the sitting of parliament, a baron who had murdered his opponent on the threshold of the principal church, Avas permitted to walk openly abroad, solely because he was a Douglas ; and no one, by his apprehension, dared to incur the vengeance of its chief.1 There were men, however, bred in these iron times, and nursed in that enthusiastic attachment to their chief created by the feudal principle, who despised all 1 Caligula, B. vi. 420.

Of this an event which now occurred strikingly demonstrated the truth. A groom of Lennox, having arrived in the capital, whether by accident or intention does not ap pear, met a fellow-servant in the street, and eagerly demanded if he had seen Hamilton the bastard of Arran ? \"I have, and but a short time since,\" was the reply. \"What!\" said he, \"and wert thou so ungrateful a recreant to thy murdered lord, as to per mit him to live? \u2014 begone! thou art unworthy of so noble a master.\" With these words this daring man sought the palace, where a numerous body of the re tainers of Douglas were mustering for a projected expedition to the borders. Singling out Hamilton from amongst them, he watched him till he left the assembly, and springing upon him as he entered a dark passage, repeatedly buried his dagger in his bosom, leaving him stretched, with six wounds, apparently lifeless upon the ground. As the cry of blood arose, he darted into the midst of the crowd, and might have eluded pursuit but for an order which commanded the palace gates to be closed, and all Avithin the court to draw up against its walls. This scrutiny instantly led to the seizure of the assassin, who was discovered, according to the strong expression of the Scottish law, \" Red hand \" with the marks of recent blood upon his dagger and his person.1 On hearing that Hamilton was likely to survive, he bitterly upbraided himself for the failure of his purpose, and Avhen in the tortures which preceded his execution, his right hand w7as amputated, obsenred, that it merited such a fate, not for its crime, but for its failure. Such were the tem pers and the principles Avhich grew out of the feudal system. 1 Lesley, p. 139. Buchanan, xix. c. 31."], [195, "1527. JAMES V. 189 To atone for the injustice of his usurpation, Angus, during his progress to the borders, assumed a severity which constrained the Armstrongs and their lawless adherents to renounce, for a season, their ferocious habits, and to give hostages for their future obedience to the government. He next proceeded to appease a deadly feud which had broken out between the families of Lesley and Forbes, and whose ramifications of pri vate vengeance, extending through the districts of Mar, Garioch, and Aberdeen, plunged the country in blood.1 The Highlands, remote from the seat of government, aud completely neglected since the defeat at Flodden, had gradually relapsed into a state of almost irretrieA'a ble disorder. Where the law was not totally forgot ten, it was perverted to the Avorst purposes of rapine and injustice : its processes were employed to screen the spoiler and the murderer : crimes Avhich mingled in their character the ferocity of a savage with the polished cunning of a refined age were perpetrated with impunity ; and the venal government of Angus neglected the outrages which they found it lucrative to countenance and almost impossible to repress. Matters at last proceeded to such an extremity, that the alternative of immediate interference, or the entire separation of the remoter northern counties from the government ,was presented. Lachlan Macintosh, chief of the noted clan Chattan, was murdered by Malcolm son, his near relative, for no other reason than that he had endeavoured to restrain the excesses of his re tainers.2 The assassin escaping, buried himself in an island of the lake of Rothiemurchy in Strathspey ; but his retreat was invaded, and he fell a victim to Ibid. p. 137. 1 Lesley, p. 136."], [196, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 152S. 190 the vengeance of the clansmen.

Scarcely had he assumed this dignity, Avhen he sent Moray a peremptory order to deliver up the infant, and, on his refusal, mercilessly ravaged his lands, sacked the town of Dyke, which belonged to him, and stormed andrazed to theground his castle of TarnaAvay.1 Nor Avas this enough: the young heir of Macintosh had been committed to the care of the Ogilvies, Moray's near kinsmen; and to revenge this imaginary insult, the ferocious mountaineer appeared before the castle of Pettie, belonging to Ogilvy of Durness, and, carrying it by assault, murdered twenty-four of their house. But the triumph Avas brief; for when Hector was about to continue his outrages, Moray, Avho had procured a royal commission, rapidly assembled an army, and sud denly invading the Macintoshes, defeated them with the utmost slaughter. Tavo hundred of the principal delinquents were made prisoners, and led to instant execution ; but the chief himself escaped ; and such was the fidelity of his clansmen, that neither rewards nor tortures could induce them to disclose the place of his retreat. His brother, however, Avas seized and hanged, whilst Hector, flying to the capital, obtained the royal mercy only to fall a victim to the dagger of a monk at St Andrews, whose history and motive are alike unknown. 2 Amid these dark and sanguinary scenes, the government of Angus continued firm, being strengthened by the friendship of England, to whose interests he cordially attached himself, and by the apparent accession of the chancellor Beaton.

The reconciliation of the archbishop to his pOAverful rivals, and his readmission to a share in the govern ment, were signalized by a lamentable event, \u2014 the arraignment and death of Patrick Hamilton abbot of Feme, the earliest, and, in some respects, the most eminent of the Scottish reformers. This youthful suf ferer was the son of Sir Patrick Hamilton of Kincavil, and Catherine Stewart, a daughter of the Duke of Albany. Educated at St Andrews, in what was then esteemed the too liberal philosophy of John Mair, the master of Knox and Buchanan, he early distin guished himself by a freedom of mind, which detected and despised the tenets of the schoolmen. He after wards imbibed, probably from the treatises of Luther, a predilection for the new doctrines ; and being sum moned before an ecclesiastical council, he preferred at that time, when his faith was still unsettled, an escape to the continent to the dangerous glory of defending his opinions. At Wittemberg, he sought and obtained the friendship of Luther and Melancthon ; they re commended him to the care of Lambert, the head of the university of Marpurg, and by this learned scholar Hamilton became fully instructed in the reformed opinions. No sooner did a full conviction of the errors of the church of Rome take possession of his mind, than a change seemed to be wrought in his character : he that before had been sceptical and timid, became"], [198, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1528. 192 courageous almost to rashness ; and resisting the tears and entreaties of his affectionate master, declared his resolution of returning to Scotland, and preaching the faith in his native country. x He embarked, arrived in 1527 at St Andrews, publicly addressed the people, and, after a brief and zealous career, was arrested by the ecclesiastical arm, and thrown into prison. His youth, (he was then only twenty-eight,) his talents, his amiable and gentle manners, interested all in his favour; and many attempts were made to induce him to retract his opinions, or, at least, to cease to disturb the tran quillity of the church by their promulgation to the people. But all AAras in vain : he considered this tran quillity not the stillness of peace, but the sleep of ignorance ; he defended his doctrines Avith such ear nestness and acquaintance with scripture, that Aless, a Catholic priest, who had visited him in his cell with a desire to shake his resolution, became himself a con vert to the captive, and he was at last condemned as an obstinate heretic, and led to the stake. On the scaffold, he turned affectionately to his servant, Avho had long attended him, and, taking off his gown, coat, and cap, bade him receive all the worldly goods now left him to bestow, and Avith them the example of his death. \" What I am about to suffer, my dear friend,\" said he, \" appears fearful and bitter to the flesh ; but remember it is the entrance to everlasting life, Avhich none shall possess who deny their Lord.\"2 In the midst of his torments, which, from the aAvkwardness of the executioner were protracted and excruciating, he ceased not to exhort those who stood near, exhibiting 1 Spottiswood, pp. 62, 63.

How long wilt thou suffer this tyranny of men?\" and when death at last came to his relief, he expired with these blessed words upon his lips, \" Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" 1 The leading doctrines of Hamilton were explained by himself in a small Latin treatise, which has been translated by Fox and incorporated in his Book of Martyrs. It contains a clear exposition of the manner in which a sinner is justified before God, through faith in Jesus Christ, and a beautiful commentary on some of the principal Christian graces. Although occasionally quaint and obscure, it proves that the mind of this good man was in advance of his age, at least in Scotland.2 It was now two years since Angus had obtained the supreme power. During this time, the despotism of the house of Douglas had been complete ; and the history of the country presented the picture of a cap tive monarch,3 a subservient and degraded nobility, and a people groaning under oppression, yet bound, by the ties of the miserable system under which they lived, to the service of their oppressors.

But Douglas, taking the young monarch in his company, and summoning the lieges to muster under the royal standard, laid siege to the fortress ; and Margaret, although she knew that her son was an unwilling enemy, and weary of his fetters, did not dare to disobey his summons. Falling on her knees before the king, she presented the keys of the fortress, and implored pardon for herself and her hus band, wdiilst Angus, in the insolence of uncontrollable dominion, smiled at her constrained submission, and ordered Henry Stewart to a temporary imprisonment.1 The secret history of this enormous power on the one hand, and implicit obedience on the other, is to be found in the fact, that the Douglases were masters of the king's person ; they compelled the young monarch to affix his signature to any deeds which they chose to offer him. Angus was chancellor, and the great seal at his command; his uncle Avas treasurer, and the revenues, as well as the law of the country, Avith its terrible processes of treason and forfeiture, Avere com pletely under his control. So long as James remained a captive, all this powerful machinery was theirs, and their authority, which it supported, could not be shaken ; but as soon as the king became free, the tyrannical system Avas undermined in its foundation and certain to disappear.

Beaton the ex-chancellor, and his assis tant in his schemes, having given a magnificent enter tainment to the young king and the Douglases in his palace of St Andrews, so completely succeeded in blinding the eyes of Angus, that the conspiracy for his destruction was matured when he deemed himself most secure.1 James prevailed first on his mother, whom it was not deemed prudent to intrust with the secret, to exchange Avith him her castle of Stirling for the lands of Methven, in Strathern, to be given Avith the dignity of peer to her husband ; and having placed this fortress in the hands of a captain on whose fidelity he could rely, he induced Angus, under some plausible pretext, to per mit him to remove to his palace of Falkland, Avithin a moderate distance from St Andrews.2 It was here easy for him to communicate with Beaton, and nothing re mained but to seize a favourable moment for the execu tion of their design: nor was this long of presenting it self. Lulled into security by the late defeat of the queen, and the well-feigned indifference of the chancellor, the Douglases had for a Avhile intermitted their rigid watch over the king. Angus had passed to Lothian, on his private affairs : Archibald his uncle, to Dundee ; and Sir George Douglas, the master of the royal household, having entered into some transactions with Beaton regarding their mutual estates, had been induced by 1 Caligula, B. iii. 136.

Calling Balfour of Ferny, the keeper of Falk land forest, and chamberlain of Fife, he issued orders for a hunting party next morning, commanding him to warn the tenantry, and assemble the best dogs in the neighbourhood ; he then took supper, wTent early to bed, under pretence of being obliged to rise next morning before daybreak, and dismissed the captain of his guard, who, without suspicion, left the royal apart ment. When all Avas quiet in the palace, James started from his couch, disguised himself as a yeoman of the guard, stole to the stable, attended by two faithful ser vants, and, throwing himself upon a fleet horse, reached Stirling before sunrise. On passing the bridge, then secured by a gate and tower, he commanded it to be shut, and kept so at the peril of the warden's life ; and then, proceeding to the castle, the governor, in a tumult of delight to behold his sovereign free, knelt down, and tendered his homage as he presented the keys of the fortress, amid the shouts and rejoicings of the garrison. Worn out with anxiety and travel, James noAV snatched a few hours of sleep ; and couriers having been de spatched in the interval, he awoke to see himself surrounded by his nobles, and felt, for the first time in his life, that he was a free monarch.1 His first act was to summon a council, and issue a proclamation that no lord or folloAver of the house of Douglas should dare to approach within six miles of the court, under pain of treason ; a step strongly indicating that vigour and judgment Avhich marked his future administration. 1 Lindsay, Hist. pp. 218, 219.

A loud and early knocking awoke him ; and Carmichael, the bailie of Abernethy, rushing in, demanded if he had lately seen the king. \" His grace,\" said Douglas, \" is yet in bed.\" \u2014 \" No, no,\" cried Carmichael ; \" ye are all deceived and betrayed ; the king has passed the bridge of Stirling.\" Sir George now flew to the royal apart ment, found it locked, burst open the door with his foot, and, to his consternation, found that the report was true. The royal vestments, which had been throAvn off for the friendly disguise, lay upon the unoccupied couch ; and Douglas, awakening to the full extent of the calamity, stood for an instant rooted to the ground, in an agony of rage and disappointment. To raise the cry of treason, and to summon Angus and his uncle, was the work of a few minutes : Avithin a few hours Angus himself and Archibald Douglas arrived in breathless haste, and, without farther delay, the three 1 In an unpublished letter of Angus to Dr Magnus, (March 15, 1527,) Caligula, B. i. 105, the vigilance of that peer is strongly marked.

Before they had proceeded any distance, they were met by the herald intrusted with the royal proclamation ; and this officer reining up his horse, boldly read the act, Avhich prohibited their approach to court under the pain of treason. For a moment they hesitated : the hereditary and haughty fearlessness of their house impelled them to proceed ; but the terror of the royal name arrested their steps ; and the same weapons which they had found invincible in their own grasp, were now employed against themselves. All the penalties of treason, the loss of their property, the desertion of their vassals, the forfeiture of their lives, rose in fearful array before them ; and, with impreca tions against their own carelessness and folly, they turned their horses heads, and slowly rode back to Linlithgow.1 1 Buchanan, xiv. 33.

Even as a boy he appeared, to the discriminating eye of Magnus, Henry's ambassador at the Scottish court, to be brave, manly, impatient of being treated as a child, and possessed of good natural talents. As he grew up, the Douglases neglected his education, and perverted his disposition by injudicious indulgences. They detected in him a strong propensity to pleasure, which they basely en- couraged, under the idea that his mind, becoming enervated by indolence and sensuality, Avould resign itself to the captivity in which they meant him to re- main ; but they were not aware of the strength of the character with which they had to deal.

Under the re straint in which he was kept, the better parts of his nature had, for a Avhile, little opportunity to display themselves ; but the plot for his escape, and which appears to haAre been principally his own contrivance, having succeeded, he became at once a free monarch, and his true character, to the delight of the nation, Avas found to be marked by some of the highest quali ties Avhich could adorn a sovereign. He possessed a strict love of justice, an unwearied application in re moving the grievances and promoting the real interests of his people, and a generosity and warmth of temper which prompted him, on all occasions, to espouse with enthusiasm the cause of the oppressed. A stranger to pride, easy of access, and fond of mingling familiarly with all classes of his subjects, he seems to have gained their affections by relying on them, and was rewarded by an appellation, of which he was not unjustly proud, \" the King of the Commons.\" With regard to the principles which guided his future policy, they arose naturally out of the circum stances in which his mind had been nurtured. The sternest feelings against the Douglases, to whose ambition he had been made a sacrifice, were mingled with a determination to recoATer those rights of the crown, Avhich had been forgotten or neglected during his minority, and to repress the power of an overgrown and venal aristocracy. Towards his uncle, Henry the Eighth, he could not possibly experience any other sentiments than those of indignation and suspicion."], [207, "JAMES V. 1528. 201 This monarch, through the exertions of his able minister, Lord Dacre, had introduced into Scotland a secret system of corruption, by which the nobles had become the pensioned agents of the English govern ment, which maintained innumerable informers in the court and throughout the country, and excited such ceaseless commotions and private Avars, that every effort for the maintenance of order and good govern ment was defeated. In his uncle, James had latterly seen nothing but a determination to support his enemies the Douglases, with the object of degrading Scotland from its rank as an independent kingdom, and, by their aid, administering it according to his pleasure. To destroy this system of foreign dictation, which since the defeat at Flodden had been gradually assuming a more serious aspect, was one great object of the king; and whilst such a design rendered his policy inimical to England, it naturally disposed him to cultivate the most friendly relations Avith France. To the success of these designs, however, great obstacles presented themselves; which, although for the moment overlooked by the sanguine mind of the king, soon compelled him to act with moderation. Henry the Eighth and Francis the First Avere noAV bound together by a strict league, of Avhich the great object was to humble the power of the emperor, Charles the Fifth ; and the French monarch received with coldness every advance which endangered a union on which the success of his political schemes so mainly depended. Nor was it long of occurring to the Scottish king, that, with a divided nobility, and his finances impoverished by the havock made in the royal revenues during his minority, it Avould be Avise to pause before he permitted his individual resent ment to hurry the nation into a war ; and that, in the"], [208, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1528. 202 meantime, it should be his first object to secure his recent elevation by the immediate proscription of his enemies. He accordingly proceeded from Stirling to Edin- burgh, where a proclamation was issued, prohibiting any Douglas, on pain of death, from remaining in the capital, and making it treason to hold intercourse with Angus or his adherents. It was resolved that a parliament should meet in the begiuning of September: the important office of chancellor was bestowed by the king upon his preceptor, Gawin Dunbar, archbishop of Glasgow ; Cairncross abbot of Holyrood was made treasurer; the bishop of Dunkeld privy-seal;1 the command of the capital, with the office of provost, intrusted to Lord Maxwell ; and Patrick Sinclair was despatched to the English court with a message to Henry, informing him of the change which had taken place, and the assumption of the supreme power by the young monarch.2 During the rapid adoption of these measures, the terror of some sudden attempt by the Douglases had not subsided. Each night the palace was strictly watched by the loyal peers and their armed folloAvers, who now formed the court; and James himself, clothed in complete mail, took his turn in commanding the guard. After a few days, the king removed to Stirling, and the nobles dispersed to their estates, with a promise to attend the ensuing parliament in great force. Meanwhile, the Earl of Angus had shut himself up in Tantallon, Avhilst his brother, Sir George Douglas, and Archibald the late treasurer, after a feeble attempt to make a diversion 1 Pollock MS. entitled a Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p.

The measures which James con templated against these powerful delinquents were not at first so severe as have been generally repre sented by our historians. Incensed, as he must have been, by the long and ignominious durance in which he had been kept, the young monarch did not instantly adopt that stern and unforgiving policy to which he was afterwards driven by the Douglases themselves. The Earl of Angus was commanded to keep himself beyond the waters of Spey, and to surrender his brother, Sir George Douglas, and his uncle, Archibald Douglas of Kilspindy, as hostages for his ansAvering to the summons of treason which Avas directed to be raised against him.1 Both orders he haughtily dis obeyed ; he mustered his vassals, fortified his castles, and provoked instead of conciliating the royal resent ment. Such conduct was attended with the effects which might have been anticipated. On the 2d of September the parliament assembled, and an act of attainder was passed against the Dou glases,2 who justified the severity by convoking their followers and razing to the ground the villages of Cranston and Cowsland.3 The lands of the arch offender Angus, were divided by James amongst those folloAvers to whose support he had probably been indebted for the success of the late revolution, Argyle, Arran, Bothwell, Buccleuch, Maxwell, and Hamilton the bastard of Arran ; Avhilst to himself the king reserved the castle of Tantallon, a place whose great strength rendered it dangerous in the hands of a sub ject. All this Avas easy, as the parliament consisted of such peers and prelates as Avere devoted to the king; 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 322-323. 1 Ibid. p. 324. 8 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 11."], [210, "204 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1528. but to carry the sentence into execution Avas a less practicable matter ; and so formidable was the power of Angus, that, for a season, he completely defied the royal wrath. In vain did the young king, in person, and at the head of a force of eight thousand men, commence the siege of Douglas castle ; admonished by the strength of the fortifications, and the injury to the harvest which must folloAV a protracted attempt, he was obliged to disband his army, and submit to the insult of having two villages, near his palace of Stir ling, sacked and given to the flames, by a party of the Douglases; who, in allusion to his late escape, re marked, that the light might be useful to their sove reign, if he chose again to travel before sunrise. An equally abortive display was soon after made before Coldingham, in which the royal forces were totally dispersed ; and in a third attempt to reduce Tantallon, the monarch, although supported by a force of twelve thousand men, was not only compelled to raise the siege, but endured the mortification of having his train of artillery attacked and captured, after an obstinate action, by Angus in person.1 It was on this occasion that the king, whose indignation was increased by the death of Falconer, the captain of his guard, aud the best naval officer in the kingdom, burst into the bitter est reproaches against Angus, and is said to have declared, with an oath, that so long as he lived no Douglas should find a resting-place in Scotland. At length, after repeated failures, and a refusal on the part of Bothwell to lead the army against the formidable rebel, the task of his expulsion from Coldingham was committed to Argyle, who, Avith the assistance of the Homes, compelled him to fly into England, an asylum 1 Lesley, pp. 140, 141.

Under other circumstances than those in Avhich the English monarch Avas now placed, the presence at his court of so formidable a person as Angus might have led Henry to an espousal of his quarrel, and have defeated any proposals for a pacification ; but the pre sent relations of this prince with the continent, and his strict coalition with Francis the First against the emperor, made him solicitous for tranquillity on the side of Scotland ; he contented himself, therefore, with an earnest request for the restoration of the rebel peer, and AA'hen this was peremptorily refused by James, abstained from interrupting the negotiations by any cavil or reiteration. The Scottish king, on the other hand, professed his obligations to Henry for many favours conferred during his minority, a senti ment for which Ave can scarcely give him the credit of sincerity; and having despatched his commissioners to meet with Magnus and Sir Thomas Tempest, the English ambassadors, at Benvick, a pacification of five years Avas concluded betAveen the two countries, and ratified on the 14th of December, 1528. To Angus was granted a remission of the sentence of death, and a consent that he might remain in England; but the forfeiture of his estates was sternly enforced, and Tantallon, with the other castles belonging to the Douglases, delivered into the hands of the king. Having settled this important matter, and secured himself on the side of England, James directed his attention to the state of the borders,1 where the 1 In the State-paper Office, is an original letter of James to Henry, dated at Jedburgh, 23d July, written on his progress to the borders. \" And at this tyme,\" says he, \" we ar in travaile towart oure bordouris, to put gude ordoure and rewle upon thame, and to stanche"], [212, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1528. 206 disorders incident to a minority had increased to a degree which threatened the total disruption of these districts. Such excesses were mainly to be attributed to Angus, the late Avarden of the marches, who had secured the friendship of the border chiefs, by over looking their offences, whilst he had bound them to his interests by those feudal covenants, named \" bands of manrent,\"1 Avhich formed one of the darkest features of the times, compelling the parties to defend each other against the effects of their mutual transgressions. The task, therefore, of introducing order and respect for legal restraints amongst the fierce inhabitants of the marches, was one of extreme difficulty. The prin cipal thieves were the border barons themselves, some of Avhom maintained a feudal state almost royal ; whilst their castles, often impregnable from the strength of their natural and artificial defences, defied every attempt to reduce or to storm them. The energy of the young monarch overcame these difficulties. Having assembled his parliament at Edinburgh, and ascertained his own strength, he represented to the three estates the impossibility of maintaining the laws, Avhen many of the highest nobles declined or dreaded the task of enforcing their obedience, and others were notorious for their viola tion of them. A strong example of rigour was, he said, absolutely required ; and this remark was in- the thyftes and rubbarys committit be theiffis and tratouris upon the samyn.

Guided by some of the borderers, Avho thus secured a pardon, he penetrated into the inmost recesses of Eskdale and Teviotdale, and seized Cockburn of Henderland, and Scott of Tushylaw, before the gates of their own castles. Both were led to almost instant execution ; and by a sanguinary example of justice, long remem bered on the marches, the famous freebooter, Johnnie Armstrong, Avas hanged, with forty-eight of his re tainers, on the trees of a little grove, where they had too boldly presented themselves to entreat the royal pardon.

The causes of these renewed disturbances are not to be traced, as in the former rebellion, to any design in the islesmen to establish a separate and independent principality under a prince of their own election; and it is probable that the imprisonment of Donald of Sleat, in the castle of Edinburgh, extinguished for a season all ambition of this sort. The sources of disaffection originated in a fierce family feud which had broken out betAAreen the Macleans of Dowrart and the Earl of Argyle, who, holding the high office of governor of the Isles, was frequently tempted to represent any attack upon him self or his adherents as a rebellion against the autho rity of the sovereign. A daughter of the earl, Lady Elizabeth Campbell, had been given in marriage to Maclean of Dowart, and the union proving unhappy, the ferocious chief exposed her upon a desolate rock near the isle of Lismore, which, at high water, was covered by the sea.2 From this dreadful situation she was rescued by a passing fishing-boat ; and, not long after, Sir John Campbell of Calder avenged the wrongs of his house by assassinating Maclean, whom he stabbed in his bed, although the Highland chief had procured letters of protection, and believed himself secure.3 Other causes of jealousy increased the mutual 1 Lesley, p. 141. s Still called the Lady Rock. 3 This murder by Sir John Campbell is alluded to in strong terms in an interesting document, preserved in the State-paper Office, dated August, 1545, entitled, \" Articles proposed by the Commissioners of the Lord of the Isles to the Privy-council, as the basis of an agreement"], [215, "1528. JAMES V. 209 exasperation ; the Macleans, strengthened by their union with the clan Ian Mhor, and led by Alexander of Isla, defied the authority of Argyle, and carried fire and sword through the extensive principality of the Campbells ; whilst they, on the other hand, retaliated with equal ferocity, and the isles of Mull and Tiree, with the wide district of Morvern, were abandoned to indiscriminate plunder. Such was the state of things in these remote dis tricts, during the years 1528 and 1529 ; about which time Argyle earnestly appealed to the council, and, describing the deplorable condition of the country, demanded more extensive poAvers to enable him to reduce it under the dominion of the laAv. But the sagacity of James suspected the representations of this poAverful noble ; and whilst he determined to levy a force sufficient to overawe the disaffected dis tricts, and, if necessary, to lead it against the Isles in person, he endeavoured to avert hostilities, by offering pardon to any of the island chiefs who would repair to court and reneAv their allegiance to their sovereign.

The commercial treaty, for one hundred years, originally concluded by James the First, between his dominions and the Netherlands, noAV about to expire, was wisely reneAved for another century.2 But it was in vain that the king strengthened his alliances abroad, and personally exerted himself at home, whilst a large proportion of his nobles thAvarted every measure for the public weal. Spoilt by the license and impunity which they had enjoyed under the misrule of Angus, and trammelled by bands of manrent amongst themselves, or with that poAverful baron, they either refused to execute the commands of 1 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 13. a Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 310."], [218, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1531. 212 the sovereign, or received them only to disobey, when removed out of the reach of the royal displeasure ; and in this manner the laws, which had been promulgated by the Avisdom of the privy council or parliament, became little else than a dead letter. Against this abuse, James Avas compelled to adopt decided mea sures. The Earl of Argyle was thrown into prison ; CraAvford, on some charges which cannot be ascer tained, lost the greater part of his estates : the dislike to the house of Douglas, and the determination to resist every proposal for their return, assumed a sterner form in the royal mind ; and the Earl of Moray, Lord MaxAvell, and Sir James Hamilton, who had shared for a Avhile the intimacy and confidence of their sove reign, found themselves treated Avith coldness and disregard.1 On the other hand, many of the clergy Avere highly esteemed, and promoted to the principal offices in the government ; nor are we to wonder at the preference evinced by the monarch, when it is considered, that in learning, talents, and acquaintance with the management of public affairs, the superiority of the spiritual over the temporal estate was decided. It was probably by the advice of Dunbar the arch bishop of Glasgow, who had been his preceptor, and now held the office of chancellor, that the king at this time instituted the College of Justice, a neAV court, of which the first idea is generally said to have been sug gested by the parliament of Paris. Much delay, confusion, and partiality accompanied those heritable jurisdictions, by which each feudal baron enjoyed the right of holding his oavii court ; and although an appeal lay to the king and the privy council, the remedy by the poorer litigant was unattainable, and by the richer 1 Caligula, B. v. 216.

In a parliament, therefore, Avhich was held at Edinburgh, (May 17, 1532,) the College of Justice was instituted, which consisted of fourteen judges, one half selected from the spiritual and the other from the temporal estate, over Avhom was placed a president, who Avas always to be a clergyman. The great object of this neAV court was to remove the means of oppression out of the hands of the aristocracy ; but as it was provided that the chancellor might preside Avhen he pleased, and that, on any occasion of consequence or difficulty, the king might send three or four members of his privy council to influence the deliberations, and give their votes, it was evident that the subject was only freed from one grievance, to be exposed to the possibility of another; less, indeed, in extent, but scarcely more endurable when it occurred.1 It is an observation of Buchanan, that the new judges, at their first meetings, devised many excellent plans for the equal administration of justice, but disappointed the nation by their future conduct, especially in their attempts to prevent any encroach ments upon their authority, by the provisions of the parliament. We must not forget, however, that, as he approaches the period of the Reformation, impar tiality is not the first virtue of this eminent man : that the circumstance of one half of the court being chosen from the spiritual estate had an effect in retarding the progress of the reformed opinions cannot be doubted. All Europe Avas noAV at peace ; the treaties of Barce lona and Cambrai had for a season settled the elements of Avar and ambition.

It Avas in the meantime the effect of all these events to give a continuance of peace to Scotland ; but the intrigues of the Earl of Bothwell, who had traitorously allied himself with England ;x the restless ambition of Angus, whose services against his native country had also been purchased by Henry;2 and the spirit of war and 1 In the State- paper Office, Border Correspondence, is an interesting and curious original MS. letter, dated Newcastle, 27th December, 1531, from the Earl of Northumberland to the king, giving a full account of a conference with the Earl of Bothwell.

Mutual inroads took place, in which the banished Douglases and Sir Anthony Darcy distinguished themselves by the extent and cruelty of their ravages ; whilst it was deemed expedient by James to divide the whole body of the fighting men in Scotland into four parts, to each of which, in rota- tion, the defence of the marches was intrusted under the command of Moray, noAV reconciled to the king, and created lieutenant of the kingdom. This measure appears to have been attended with happy effects ; and at the same time, the Scottish monarch evinced his poAver of distressing the government of Henry, should he persist in encouraging his rebel subjects, by raising a body of seven thousand Highlanders, under the leading of Mac-Ian, to assist O'Donnel the Irish chief, in his attempts to shake off the English yoke. It appears from a letter of the Earl of Northumberland to Henry the Eighth, that the Earl of Argyle, about the same time, had been deprived of the chief command iu the Isles, which was conferred upon Mac-Ian ; a circumstance which had completely alienated the for- mer potent chief, and disposed him, Avith the Avhole strength of his vassals and retainers, to throw himself into the arms of England. But this dangerous dis- content was not confined to Argyle : it was shared, in all its bitterness, by the Earl of CraAvford, whose authority in the same remote districts had been plucked from his grasp, and placed in the hands of Mac-Ian.1 Henry, Caligula, B. i. 129, to \"mak unto us the othe of allegiawnce, and recognize us as supreme Lorde of Scotland, and as his prince and soveraigne.\" 1 Caligula, B. i. 129. \" The king of Skottis hath plucked from the Erie of Argile, and from his heires for ever ; the rule of all the oute"], [222, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1532. 216 Neither was James absolutely secure of the support of the clergy : they viewed with jealousy an attempt to raise from their dioceses a tax of ten thousand croAvns, within the period of a single year ; and so effectually addressed themselves to the pope, that a bull was obtained, Avhich limited the sum, and extended the period for its contribution. The mutual hostilities upon the borders had now continued with unmitigated rancour for more than a year, each sovereign professing his anxiety for peace, yet unAvilling, when provoked by aggression, to deny himself the triumph of revenge, and the consolation of plunder. The flames of towns and villages; the destruc tion of the labour of the husbandman, and of the enter prise and industry of the merchant; the embittering of the spirit of national animosity, and the corruption of the aristocracy of the country, by the money and in trigues of England \u2014 all these pernicious consequences were produced by the protraction of the war, which, although no open declaration had been made by either monarch, continued to desolate the country. It was in vain that Francis the First despatched his ambas sador to the Scottish court, with the object of medi ating between the two countries, whose interests were now connected with his own. James upbraided him, and not Avithout justice, with his readiness to forget the alliance between their tAvo kingdoms, and to sacri fice the welfare of Scotland to the ambition of Henry, his new ally. The negotiation was thus defeated ; but again Francis made the attempt : Beauvois, a second ambassador, arrived at the Scottish court ; and the monarch relaxed so far in his opposition, that he con- Isles, and given the same to Mackayne and his heires for ever ; and also taken from the Erie Crawford such lands as he had ther, and given the same to the said Mackayne : the whiche hath engendered a grete hatrit in the said Erie's harte against the said Skottis king.\""], [223, "JAMES V. 1532. 217 sensed to a conference for a truce, which, although it had been stipulated to commence early in June, was protracted by the mutual disputes and jealousies of the contracting parties till near the Avinter. In the meantime, the king resolved to set out on a summer progress through his dominions, in the course of which an entertainment was given to the yet youth ful monarch by the Earl of Athole, which is strikingly illustrative of the times. This potent Highland chief tain, who perhaps indulged in the hope of succeeding to a portion of the poAver so lately Avrested from Argyle, received his S0ATereign at his residence in Athole, with a magnificence which rivalled the creations of romance. A rural palace, curiously framed of green timber, was raised in a meadow, defended at each angle by a high toAver, hung in its various chambers Avith tapestry of silk and gold, lighted by windoAvs of stained glass, and surrounded by a moat, in the manner of a feudal fort ress. In this fairy mansion the king Avas lodged more sumptuously than in any of his own palaces ; he slept on the softest down, listened to the sweetest music, s\u00ab\u00a3' the fountains around him floAving Avith muscadel and hippocras, angled for the most delicate fish which gleamed in the little streams and lakes in the meadow, or pursued the pastime of the chase, amid Avoods and mountains Avhich abounded with every species of game. The queen-mother accompanied her son; and an ambas sador from the papal court having arrived shortly be fore, Avas invited to join in the royal progress. The splendour, profusion, and delicacy of this feudal enter tainment, given by those whom he had been accustomed to consider barbarians, appeared almost miraculous, even to the warmth of an Italian imagination ; and his astonishment Avas not diminished, Avhen Athole, at the departure of the royal cavalcade, declared that the"], [224, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 218 1533. palace which had given delight to his sovereign should never be profaned by a subject, and commanded the whole fabric, with its innumerable luxuries, to be given to the flames. Although provoked by the continuance of the border inroads, which were carried on with the connivance of the English monarch at the moment he professed an anxiety for peace, James wisely suppressed his resent ment, and contented himself with a temperate remon strance. His situation, indeed, owing to the continued intrigues of the adherents of the house of Douglas, and the secret support they received from England,1 was perilous and harassing; and Avhatever might be his individual feelings, it became evident that peace Avith that country must be secured, even at some sacrifice. The Bishop of Aberdeen and Sir Adam Otterburn were accordingly despatched to the English court Avith full powers ; and having met Avith the English com missioners, the Secretary CroniAvell and Dr Fox, a pacification was concluded, Avhich Avas to last during the lives of the two monarchs, and to continue for a year after the death of him aat1io first deceased. It appears that the Douglases, since their forfeiture, had gained possession of Edrington castle, which James, who Avas jealous of their retaining even the smallest property Avithin his dominions, insisted should be re stored. On this condition he agreed that Angus, Sir George Douglas his brother, and Archibald his uncle, might remain unmolested in England, supported by Henry as his subjects ; provided, according to the border laws, reparation was made for any enterprise 1 In the State-paper Office is a letter from James to Henry, dated 18th March, 1533-4, in which he complains, that since the departure of his ambassador towards England, an incursion had been made by some borderers under Sir R.

The treaty was concluded on the 12th of May, 1534, and soon after ratified with circumstances of much solemnity and rejoicing by both monarchs.1 The young king was soon after flattered by the arrival of Lord William Howard, with the Order of the Garter from England ; Avhilst Francis the First requested his acceptance of that of St Michael ; and the Emperor Charles the Fifth transmitted the Golden Fleece,2 by his ambassador Godeschalco. James was noAV in his tAventy-second year, and his marriage Avas earnestly desired by his subjects. His fearlessness in his constant efforts to suppress in person the disturbances which agitated his kingdom exposed him to constant danger : he would often, with no greater force than his own retinue, attack and apprehend the fiercest banditti ; riding by night through solitary and remote parts of his dominions ; invading them in their fastnesses, and sharing in peril and privations with the meanest of his followers. Nor was he content with this nobler imitation of his father, but he unhappily inherited from him his propensity to Ioav intrigue, and often exposed his life to the attacks of the robber or the assassin in his nocturnal visits to his mistresses. It was observed that the Hamiltons, who, next to the Duke of Albany, (now an elderly man Avithout chil dren,) had the nearest claim to the throne, looked upon this courage and recklessness of the king with a satis faction which Avas scarcely concealed ; and Buchanan has even stated, although upon no certain evidence, that they had made attempts against his life.

He regretted at the same time the continued hostility between his uncle and the emperor, expressed his sorroAv for the violent measure of his double divorce from Queen Catherine and the papal see, and declared his own determination to support the religion of his fathers, and to resist the enemies of the church.1 This resolution he soon after fulfilled, by encouraging a renewed persecution of the reformers. An ecclesias- tical court Avas held in the abbey of Holyrood ; Hay bishop of Ross presided as commissioner for the car- dinal ; and the king, completely clothed in scarlet, the judicial costume of the time, took his seat upon the bench, and gave unwonted solemnity to the unholy tribunal. Before it many were cited to answer for their alleged heretical opinions ; some recanted, and publicly abjured their errors ; others, amongst whom were the brother and sister of Patrick Hamilton, Avho had sacrificed his life for his opinions,2 fled from the country and took refuge in England ; but David Strai- ton and Norman Gourlay a priest, appeared before the judges and boldly defended their faith. Straiton was a gentleman of good family, brother to the baron of Lauriestou. He had engaged in a quarrel with the Bishop of Moray on the subject of his tithes ; and in a fit of indignation, had commanded his servants, when challenged by the collectors, to throAv eA'ery tenth fish they caught into the sea, bidding them seek their tax where he found the stock. From these violent courses he had softened doAvn into a more quiet inquiry 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 809. 2 Supra, pp. 192, 193."], [227, "JAMES V. 1531. 221 into the grounds of the right claimed by churchmen ; and frequenting much the company of Erskine of Dun, one of the earliest and most eminent of the reformers, became at length a sincere convert to their doctrines. It is related, that listening to the Scripture, which was read to him by the Laird of Laurieston, he came upon that passage wdiere our Saviour declares he will deny before his Father and the holy angels any one who hath denied him before men : upon which he was deeply moved, and falling doAvn on his knees, implored God, that although he had been a great sinner, he would never permit him, from the fear of any bodily torment, to deny Him or his truth.1 And the trial soon came, and was most courageously encountered.

To this end he made an earnest proposal for a marriage between James and his daughter the Princess Mary: he despatched successively Dr Barlow his chaplain, and Lord William HoAvard, into Scotland, Avith the suggestion that a conference should take place at York, betAveen himself and the Scottish king ; 2 and he endeavoured to open James's eyes to the crimes and usurpations of the hierarchy of the church of Rome. But it was the frequent fault of the English monarch that he defeated many a wise purpose by the impetu osity Avith which he attempted to carry it forward ; and, in this instance, the keenness of BarloAv, and the haughtiness of HoAvard, were ill calculated to manage so delicate a negotiation. James, acting by the advice of his privy council, who were mostly ecclesiastics, and are described by Barlow as \" the pope's pestilent crea tures, and very limbs of the devil,\" refused to accept the treatise entitled \" The Doctrine of a Christian Man,\" which had been sent him by his uncle. The conference to Avhich, through the influence of the queen-dowager, the king had at first consented, was indefinitely postponed ; 2 and the feelings of the sove reign and his counsellors, regarding the marriage Avith an English princess, were soon plainly expressed by the despatch of an embassy to France for the purpose of concluding a matrimonial alliance with that crown.

The confirmation of his supre macy as head of the church by the English parliament, the declared legality of the divorce, and the legitimacy of the children of Anne Boleyn, with the cruel impri sonment and subsequent execution of Fisher and More, convinced the new pontiff, Paul the Third, that he had for ever lost the English monarch. It only remained for him to adopt every method for the preservation of the spiritual allegiance of his remaining children. Amongst other missions he despatched his legate, An tonio Campeggio, into Scotland, with instructions to use every effort for the confirmation of James in his attachment to the popedom ; Avhilst he trusted that the marriage of the second son of Francis the First to the pope's niece, Catherine de Medici, Avould have the effect of enlisting the whole interest of this monarch against the dissemination of the Lutheran opinions in his dominions. To James, Campeggio addressed an ex position of the scandalous conduct of the English king in making his religious scruples, and his separation from the church of Rome, a cloak for the gratification of his lust and ambition ; he drew a flattering contrast between the tyranny and hypocrisy which had guided his conduct, and the attachment of his youthful nephew of Scotland to the holy see, addressing him by that title of Defender of the Faith,1 which had been unwrorthily bestowed upon its Avorst enemy ; and he laid at his feet a cap and sword which had been consecrated by the pope upon the anniversary of the Nativity.

In the meantime, the Scottish ambassadors in France had concluded a marriage between their sovereign and Marie de Bourbon, daughter of the Duke of Vendosme; Avhilst Henry, jealous of the late papal embassy, and aware that such a union must confirm the attachment of his nephew to the Roman see, encouraged the dis contents amongst the Scottish nobility, promoted the intrigues of the Douglases for their restoration to their native country, and even succeeded in corrupting the fidelity of James's ambassador, Sir Adam Otterburn, who was afterwards imprisoned for a secret negotiation with the partisans of Angus.1 A parliament was held this summer, (June 8th, 1535,) in Avhich, amid much that is uninteresting to the historian, there are found some provisions worthy of attention. It was made imperative on the border barons and gentlemen to restore something like secu rity to their disturbed districts, by rebuilding the towers and \"Peels\" which had been razed during the late wars ; \" Weapon-schawings,\" or armed musters, were enforced ; and the importation of arms, harness, and warlike ammunition, was encouraged. The act 1 In the State-paper Office is a letter from Otterburn to Cromwell, dated 18th of October, (probably of the year 1535,) in which he regrets that he was not able, from illness, to pay more attention to the English ambassadors ; and states, that although they could not agree touching the authority of the pope, he would use every effort to preserve the amity between the two kingdoms. The practices of Otterburn, and his secret correspondence with the English, had been of long duration.

It is evident that the late cruel ex hibitions had only fostered the principles which they Avere meant to eradicate. One other act relating to the burghs, in that dark age the little nurseries of industry and freedom, is striking, and must have had important consequences. It appears that a practice had crept in of electing the feudal barons in the neighbourhood to the offices in the magistracy of the burgh ; and the effects, as might have been anti cipated, Avere highly injurious. Instead of industrious citizens occupied in their respective trades, and add ing, by their success, to the wealth, the tranquillity, and the general civilisation of the country, the pro vost and aldermen, or bailies, were idle, factious, and tyrannical ; domineering over the industrious bur gesses, and consuming their substance. To remedy this, it was provided that no man hereafter should be chosen to fill any office in the magistracy of the burgh, but such as were themselves honest and substantial burgesses ; a wise enactment, Avhich, if carried strictly into execution, must haAre been attended with the best effects.1 The continued Avar between Francis and the emperor made it expedient for the former monarch to keep on good terms with Henry ; and so effectually was the 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 349.

The vessel in which he embarked with his slender retinue encountered a severe gale, and the monarch, who had fallen asleep from fatigue, found himself, on aAArakening, once more close to the coasts of Scotland ; a result which some of our historians have ascribed to the jealousy of his companion, Sir James Hamilton, who, during the slumber of his master, seized the helm and put about the ship. It is Avell knoAATn that the Hamiltons, from their hopes of suc cession to the crown, were opposed to the marriage ; yet it may be questioned Avhether they would thus publicly expose their ambition. But the king Avas not to be so easily deterred from his design ; and his project of a voyage in disguise having failed, he determined to execute his purpose with suitable deliberation and magnificence. A re gency was appointed, which consisted of Beaton the archbishop of St Andrews, Dunbar archbishop of GlasgOAV the chancellor, the Earls of Eglinton, Mon trose, and Huntley, Avith the Lord Maxwell ; and the king, having first paid his devotions at the shrine dedicated to our Lady of Loretto, near Musselburgh, and offered his prayers for a happy voyage, sailed from Leith with a squadron of seven vessels, accom panied by a splendid suite of his spiritual and temporal nobility. A fair wind brought them on the tenth day to Dieppe ; and Francis, whose hopes were at"], [233, "JAMES V. 1536. 227 this moment highly elated by his successes against the emperor, immediately invited the royal A7isiter to Paris, and despatched the dauphin to conduct him thither. James's first desire, hoAveArer, wras to see his affianced bride ; and, repairing in disguise to the palace of the Duke de Vendosme, he was recognized, as he mingled with the gay crowds that peopled its halls, by his likeness to a miniature portrait which he had sent her from Scotland. Marie de Bourbon is said to have been deeply captivated by the noble mien and gallant accomplishments of her intended husband ; but the impression was not mutual : and whether from the ambition of a higher alliance, or the fickleness of youthful affection, James transferred his loA^e from the Lady of Vendosme, to the Princess Magdalen, the only daughter of Francis, a beautiful girl of sixteen, but over whose features consumption had already thrown a melancholy languor, Avhich was in vain pointed out to the king by the warning voice of his counsellors. It is said by the French historians, that the princess had fallen in love with the Scottish monarch at first sight ; and although her father ear nestly and affectionately dissuaded the match, on account of her extreme delicacy of constitution, James would hear of no delay; and on neAV-year's day the marriage was celebrated with much pomp in the church of Notre-Dame. The Kings of France and Navarre, and many illustrious foreigners, surrounded the altar ; and Rome, as if to confirm and flatter its youthful champion, lent a peculiar solemnity to the ceremony by the presence of seven cardinals. Feasts, masques, tournaments, and all the accompaniments of feudal joy and magnificence succeeded ; nor^vas it till the spring that the king thought of his departure with his youthful queen."], [234, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 228 1536. An application had been made by Francis to Henry, that the royal couple should be allowed to pass through England, but it was refused. The secret reasons of this ungracious proceeding, which appear in a minute of the privy council, were the discontent felt by the English monarch at the refusal of his request for the pardon of Angus, and a desire to avoid the expense of receiving his royal nephew with the honours due to his rank. Compelled to return by sea, James embarked at Dieppe, and arrived with his youthful bride at Leith, on the 19th of May. On descending from the ship, Magdalen knelt upon the beach, and taking up some portion of the sand, kissed it Avith deep emotion, whilst she implored a blessing upon her new country, and her beloved husband : an affecting incident, when vieAved in connexion with her rapid and early fate. Meanwhile, nothing could exceed the joy of the people at the return of their prince ; and the graceful and elegant festivals of France wrere succeeded bv the ruder, but not less cordial, pageants of his OAvn kingdom. James had remained in Paris for nearly nine months: an interval of no little importance, when Ave consider the great changes Avhich were so suddenly to succeed his arrival in his dominions. The causes of these events, wdiich have hitherto escaped the notice of our historians, are well Avorthy of investigation. Of these, the first seems to be the remarkable influence which Francis acquired over the mind of his son-in-law; an influence which, notwithstanding the peace then nomi nally existing betAveen Henry and the French monarch, was unquestionably employed in exciting him against England. The progress of the reformed opinions in France, the violence and selfishness of Henry, and the dictatorial tone which he Avas accustomed to infuse into his negotiations, although for the time it did not"], [235, "1537. JAMES V. 229 produce an actual breach between the two monarchs, could not fail to alienate so high-minded a prince as Francis. The pope, whose existence seemed to hang on the result, intermitted no effort to terminate the disputes between the French king and the emperor, projecting a coalition against Henry as the common enemy of Christendom. He had so far succeeded in 1537, as to accomplish a truce concluded at Nice be- tween these two great potentates, Avhich was extended in the folloAving year to a pacification of ten years. From this time the cordiality between Francis and Henry was completely at an end, Avhilst the pope did not despair to bring about a combination which should make the royal innovator tremble for his boasted supremacy, and even for his throne. It was with this object that James was flattered by every argument which could have weight in a young and ardent mind, to induce him to unite himself cordially in the league. On the other hand, the conduct of Henry during the absence of the Scottish king was little calculated to allay the feelings of irritation and resentment Avhich already existed between them. Sir Ralph Sadler, a minister of great ability, had been sent into Scotland, to complete the system of secret influence and intelli- gence introduced and long acted on by Lord Dacre. He was instructed to gain an influence over the nobi- lity, to attach to his interest the queen-mother, and to sound the inclinations of the people on the subject of peace or war \u2014 an adoption of the reformed opinions, or a maintenance of the ancient religion. The Dou- glases were still maintained Avith high favour and generous allowances in England: their power, although nominally extinct, was still far from being destroyed ; their spies penetrated into every quarter, followed the king to France, and gave information of his most"], [236, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1537. 230 private motions ;x their feudal covenants and bands of manrent still existed, and bound many of the most potent nobility to their interest; Avhilst the vigour of the king's government, and his preference of the clergy to the temporal lords, disgusted these proud chiefs, and disposed them to hope for a recovery of their influence from any change which might take place. All these circumstances were well known to the Scottish king, and a more prospective policy might perhaps have dictated a reconciliation with the Dou glases as the likeliest means of accomplishing his great design for the maintenance of the Catholic religion, and the humbling the poAver of England : but the tyranny of this haughty house, and the injuries w7hich they had accumulated upon him, Avere yet fresh in his memory. He had determined that so long as he lived, no Douglas should ever return to Scotland : he underrated, probably, the poAver possessed by a feudal nobility ; and being naturally endowed with uncommon vigour and resolution of mind, determined to attempt the execution of his plans, not only with out their support, but in the face of their utmost endeavours against him. We may thus discern the state of parties at the return of James to his domi nions. On the one hand is seen Henry the Eighth, the great foe to the supremacy of the see of Rome, supported in Scotland not only by the still formid able power and unceasing intrigues of the Douglases, but by a large proportion of the nobles, and the talents of his sister the queen-mother. On the other hand, we perceive the King of Scotland, backed by the united talent, zeal, and wealth of the Catholic 1 Letter of Penman to Sir G. Douglas. Caligula, B. iii. 293.

JAMES V. 231 clergy ; the loyalty of some of the most potent peers ; the cordial co-operation of France ; the approval of the emperor ; the affection of the great body of his people, upon Avhom the doctrines of Luther had not as yet made any very general impression ; and the cordial support of the papal see. The progress of events will strongly develop the operation and collision of these various parties and interests. We shall be enabled to observe the sIoav but uninterrupted progress towards the reception of the great principles of the Reformation, and, amid much individual error and suffering, to mark the sublime manner in which the Avrath and the sin of man are compelled to work out the predetermined purposes of a most wise and holy God. To resume the current of events : the monarch had scarcely settled in his dominions, and entered upon the administration of the government, Avhen his youth- ful and beautiful queen sunk under the disease Avhich had so strongly indicated itself before her marriage ; and, to the deep sorrow of her husband and the whole nation, expired on the 7th of July. The mind of the sovereign, although cloudedfor a season by the' calamity, soon shook off the enervating influence of grief; and James demonstrated the firmness of purpose Avith Avhich he had adopted his plans, in the decided step Avhich he took within a feAV months after this sad event. David Beaton bishop of Mirepoix, and afterwards the celebrated cardinal, Avas sent on a matrimonial embassy to France, accompanied by Lord Maxwell and the Master of Glencairn, where, Avith the least possible delay, he concluded the espousals between Mary of Guise, the AvidoAV of the Duke of Longueville, and his royal master. Nor Avas the full year of grief allowed to elapse before the princess arrived, and the king celebrated his second marriage in the cathedral church"], [238, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1537. 232 at St Andrews.1 The ties which attached him to France were thus doubly strengthened, and the con sequences of this union Avith the house of Guise may be long detected in those clouds of dark and compli cated misfortune which were now slowly gathering around the country. In the interval between the death of Magdalen and the union with Mary of Guise, the life of the monarch had been twice menaced by secret conspiracy ; and there seems to be little doubt, that both plots are to be traced to the widely spreading intrigues of the house of Douglas ; nay, there is a strong presumption that they were directly connected with each other. The first plot, and that Avhich seems to have attracted least notice, was headed by the Master of Forbes, a fierce and turbulent chief, distinguished under the govern ment of Albany for his murder of Seton of Meldrum, and his subserviency to the schemes of England. This person was tried, condemned, and executed, on the same day; but, unfortunately, in the absence of all authentic records, it is difficult to detect the particu lars of the conspiracy. Having married a sister of the Earl of Angus, he was naturally a partisan of the Douglases ; and, upon their fall from power, and sub sequent banishment from Scotland, he appears to have vigorously exerted himself in those scenes of private coalition and open violence by which their friends attempted to promote their interests and accelerate their return. For the same reason he had been a decided 1 Henry the Eighth, as it appears by the Ambassade de M. Chatillon, Lettres Dec. 10 and 11, had become, by the report of Mr Wallop, one of his agents, enamoured of the same lady, chiefly on account of her large and comely size. He demanded her of Francis, and took the refusal violently amiss, although it was stated to him that the con tract of marriage between this princess and James the Fifth had been solemnly concluded. \u2014 Carte's History, vol. iii. p. 152."], [239, "1537. JAMES V. 233 enemy of Albany during his government, and the refusal of the Scottish lords encamped at Wark to lead their vassals against England, was mainly ascribed to his con duct and counsel ; a proceeding which was, in the eye of law, an act of treason, as Albany Avas then regent by the appointment of the three estates. There is no evidence that any notice was taken of this at the time, but as early as the king's journey to France, in June 1536, Forbes had been accused by Huntley of a design to shoot the king as he passed through his burgh of Aberdeen, and of conspiring the destruction of a part of the army of Scotland, \u2014 charges upon which both himself and his father, Lord Forbes, Avere then imprisoned ; nor did the trial take place till upAvards of fourteen months after. The meagre details of our early criminal records, unfortunately, do not permit us to ascertain the nature of the proofs against him. He was found guilty by a jury, against Avhom Calderwood has brought an unsupported assertion that they Avere corrupted by Huntley;1 but, as far as can be discovered, the accusation seems unjust : no bias or partiality can be traced to any of the jurymen; no previous animosity can be established against Huntley, but rather the contrary ; 2 and the leniency of James, in the speedy liberation of Lord Forbes, in admitting the brother of the criminal to an office in his household, and abstain ing from the forfeiture of his estates, proved the absence of every thing like vindictive feeling. All men re joiced at the acquittal of the father, and some doubted whether the crime for Avhich he suffered was brought home to the son, but none lamented the fate of one already stained by murder and spoliation of a very 1 Calderwood Hist.

Nor is it to be forgotten, that Albany, on his return from this unfortunate expedition, accused the Scottish nobles, not only of retiring in the face of the enemy, but of entertaining a secret design of delivering him to the English.2 It is not improbable that the secret reason for the long delay of the trial, is to be found in the anxiety of the king to obtain from Albany, AvhoAA'as then in France, decisive evidence against the criminal. The other conspiracy, of which the guilt Avas more certain, and in its character more dreadful, excited a deeper interest and sympathy, from the sex and beauty of the accused. Janet Douglas, the sister of the banished Angus, had married Lord Glammis, and, after his death, took to her second husband a gentle man named Campbell of Skipnish. Her son, Lord Glammis, Avas in his sixteenth year, and she a youth ful matron, in the maturity of her beauty, had mingled little Avith the court since the calamity of her house. A week had scarcely passed since James had paid the last rites to his beloved queen, and the mind of the monarch was still absorbed in the bitterness of recent 1 Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. i. pp. 183, 187.

Her son, Lord Glammis, a youth in his sixteenth year, was convicted, upon his OAvn confession, that he knew and had concealed the conspiracy ; but the monarch commiserated his youth, and the sentence of death was changed into imprison ment. Archibald Campbell of Skipnish, her husband, having been shut up in the castle of Edinburgh, in attempting to escape, perished miserably, by being dashed to pieces on the rocks ; John Lyon, an ac complice, AAras tried and hanged ; Avhilst Makke, by Avhom the poison had been prepared, and from Avhom it was purchased, escaped with the loss of his ears, and banishment.2 It must be confessed, that the circum stances of this remarkable tragedy are involved in much obscurity ; but an examination of the evidence AAdiich 1 The Master of Forbes was tried, condemned, and executed, on the 14th of July ; Lady Glammis was tried, condemned, and executed, on the 17th of the same month.

Vol. i. pp. 646, 668."], [242, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1538. 236 has been lately published, leaves upon the mind little doubt of her guilt.1 Although James supported his clergy in their per secution of the Protestant doctrines, which were now rapidly gaining ground in the country, it was not so much Avith the zeal of a bigot as with the views of a politician. That he was not indisposed to a moderate reformation of the abuses in the Catholic church, is evident from the liberality with which he permitted the exhibition of the dramatic satire of Lindsay, and the severity of his censures upon the excesses of some of the prelates ; but his determination to humble the power of the nobles, to destroy the secret influence of England, and to reign a free monarch over an inde pendent kingdom, Avas, he thought, to be best accom plished by the assistance of the great body of the clergy, whose talents, wealth, and influence formed the only effectual counterpoise to the Aveight of the temporal peers. The impetuosity of the character of Henry, and the haughtiness Avith which he dictated his commands, alienated from him the mind of his nephew, and disposed him to listen with greater favour to the proposals of Francis, and the wishes of the house of Guise. The state of England also encouraged him to hope, that the king wrould be soon too much engrossed with his domestic affairs, to find leisure for a continuance of his intrigues with Scot land. The discontents amongst his Catholic subjects had become so deep and general, that within no very long period three insurrections had broken out in 1 See, in the Illustrations, a note on the conspiracy of the Lady Glammis, letter C.

JAMES V. 237 different parts of the country ; various prophecies, songs, and libellous rhymes, which spoke openly of the accession of the Scottish monarch to the English throne, began to be circulated amongst the people ; and numerous parties of disaffected Catholics, intimi dated by the violence of Henry, took refuge in the sister kingdom. James, indeed, in his intercourse with the English council, not only professed his con tempt for such \" fantastic prophecies,\" but ordered that all who possessed copies of them should instantly, under the penalty of death and confiscation, commit them to the flames;1 yet, so far as they indicated the unpopularity of the king, it may be conjectured that he regarded them with satisfaction. Another event, which happened about this time, was attended with important consequences. James Beaton archbishop of St Andrews, who had long exercised a commanding influence over the affairs of the kingdom, died in the autumn of the year 1539, and Avas succeeded in the primacy by his nephew, Cardinal Beaton, a man far superior in talent, and still more devotedly attached to the interests of the church from which he derived his exaltation. It was Beaton who had negotiated the second marriage of the king with Mary of Guise ; and such was the high opinion which his royal master entertained of his abilities in the management of state affairs, that he appears soon to have selected him as his principal adviser in the accomplishment of those great schemes which hoav occupied his mind. Beaton's accession to the supreme ecclesiastical authority, Avas marked by a renewed persecution of 1 Caligula, B. i. 295.

It was a remarkable circumstance, that however corrupt may have been the higher orders of the Roman Catholic church at this period in Scotland, the great majority of converts to the principles of the Reformation were to be found amongst the orders of the inferior clergy. This was shown in the present persecution. Keillor, a black friar, Dean Thomas Forret, vicar of Dollar, and a canon regular of the monastery of St Colm's Inch, Simpson, a priest, John BevTeridge, also a black friar, and Forrester, a notary in Stirling, Avere summoned to appear before a council held by Cardinal Beaton, and William Chisholme the Bishop of Dunblane. It gives us a low opinion of the purity of the ecclesiastical judges before whom these early disciples of the Reformation were called, AAThen Ave find the bench filled by Beaton and Chisholme, the first notorious for his gallantry and licentiousness, the second commemorated by Keith as the father of three natural children, for Avhom he provided portions by alienating the patrimony of his bishoprick.1 Friar Keillor had roused the indignation of the church by the composition of one of those plays, or dramatic \" mysteries,\" common in these times, in AA'hich, under the character of the chief priests and Pharisees Avho condemned our Saviour, he had satirized the prelates who persecuted his true disciples. Against Forret, Avho owed his conversion to the perusal of a volume of St Augustine, a more singular charge Avas preferred, if we may believe the ecclesiastical historian. He was accused of preaching to his parishioners, a duty then inArariably abandoned to the orders of friars ; and of exposing the mysteries of Scripture to the vul gar in their own tongue.

Kennedy is described by Knox as one who possessed a fine genius for Scottish poetry; and it is not improbable he may, like Lindsay and Dunbar, have distinguished himself by some of those satirical effusions against the higher clergy, which it is well known were not the least efficient weapons in pre paring the way for the Reformation. But the prospect of so cruel a death shook his resolution, and it Avas expected he was about to recant, when the exhortations of Russel, a meek but courageous partisan of the new doctrines, produced a sudden change. Falling on his knees, he blessed the goodness and mercy of God, which had saved him from impending destruction, and breaking out into an ecstacy of triumph, declared he noAV coveted death, and would readily endure the utmost tortures they could inflict. \" Now,\" said Russel, fixing his eyes on the prelates who presided ; \" now is your hour, and the power of darkness ; ye now sit in judgment, whilst we stand before you falsely accused and most wrongfully condemned.

The continued and mutual inroads upon the borders now called loudly for redress ; and Henry, having de spatched the Duke of Norfolk, his lieutenant in the north, to punish the malefactors, the Scottish king, in a letter addressed to that nobleman, not only expressed his satisfaction with this appointment, but his readi ness to deliver into his hands all English subjects Avho had fled into Scotland.1 The presence of the English earl in the disturbed districts was soon after followed by the mission of Sir Ralph Sadler to the Scottish court, an event accelerated by the intelligence which Henry had received of the coalition between Francis the First and the emperor, and by his anxiety to pre vent his nephew from joining the confederacy agaiust him. Of Sadler's reception and negotiation wre fortu nately possess an authentic account, and it throws a clear light upon the state of parties in Scotland. His instructions directed him to discover, if possible, James's real intentions with regard to the league by the emperor and Francis against England ; to ascertain in what manner the monarch was affected toAvards the reformed opinions, and by an exposure of the tyranny of the papal power, the scandalous lives of the majority of the clergy, and the enormous wealth Avhich had been engrossed by the church, to awaken the royal mind to the necessity and the advantage of a suppression of the monasteries, and a rupture with the supreme pontiff. To accomplish this more effectually, the ambassador carried with him certain letters of Cardinal Beaton, addressed to Rome, which had accidentally fallen into Henry's hands, and the contents of which it was 1 Original letter in the State-paper Office.

This prince declared, and apparently Avith sincerity, that if Henry's conduct corresponded to his professions, nothing should induce him to join in any hostile coalition with Charles or Francis; but he steadily refused to imitate his example in throwing off his allegiance to the head of the church, dissolving the monasteries, or abjuring the religion of his fathers. As to the letters of the cardinal, the king remarked that he had already seen them, and he smiled with polite contempt when Sadler attributed to Beaton a scheme for the usurping the government of his realm, and placing it in the hands of the pope. He admitted, at the same time, the profligacy of some of his clergy, and declared with an oath that he Avould compel them to lead a life more suitable to their profession ; but he pronounced a merited eulogium on their superior know ledge and talents, their loyalty to the government, and their readiness to assist him in his difficulties. When pressed upon the point of a conference, he dexterously waved the subject, and, without giving a refusal, 1 It gives us a mean opinion of the wisdom of the English monarch, to find Sadler instructed to remonstrate with James upon his unkingly mode of increasing his revenue, by his keeping vast flocks of sheep, and busying himself in other agricultural pursuits."], [249, "1540. JAMES V. 243 declared his Avish that his ally the King of France should be present on the occasion, a condition upon which Sadler had received no instructions. On the whole the conference betAveen James and the ambas sador placed in a favourable light the prudence and good sense of the Scottish monarch, under circum stances which required the exertion of these qualities in no common degree.1 He now meditated an important enterprise, and only awaited the confinement of the queen to carry it into effect.2 The remoter portions of his kingdom, the northern counties, and the Western and Orkney islands, had, as we have already seen, been grievously neglected during his minority ; they had been torn by the con tentions of hostile clans ; and their condition, owing to the incursions of the petty chiefs and pirate adventurers who infested these seas, was deplorable. This the monarch now resolved to redress, by a voyage con ducted in person, and fitted out upon a scale Avhich had not before been attempted by any of his predecessors. A fleet of twelve ships was assembled, amply furnished with artillery, provided for a lengthened voyage, and commanded by the most skilful mariners in his domi nions. Of these, six ships Avere appropriated to the king, three were victuallers, and the remaining three carried separately the cardinal, the Earl of Huntley, and the Earl of Arran.3 Beaton conducted a force of 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. pp. 29, 30. 2 Caligula, B. iii. 219. \" Albeit it is said the kynge of Scottis causes the schippys to be furnysched and in a redines, and after the queene be delivered he will go hymself.\" J.

It was one laudable object of the king in his voyage, to complete an accurate nautical survey of the northern coasts and isles ; for which purpose he carried Avith him Alexander Lindsay, a skilful pilot and hydrographer, whose charts and observations remain to the present day.1 But his principal design was to overawe the rebellious chiefs, to enforce obe dience to the laws, and to reduce within the limits of order and good government a portion of his dominions which, for the last thirty years, had repeatedly refused to acknowledge their dependence upon the Scottish crowm. On the 22d of May, to the great joy of the monarch aud his people, the queen presented them Avith a prince ; and James, whose preparations were com plete, hoisted the royal flag on board the admiral's ship, and favoured with a serene heaven and a favour able breeze, conducted his fleet along the populous coasts of Fife, Angus, and Buchan, till he doubled the promontory of Kennedar.2 He next visited the wild shores of Caithness, and, crossing the Pentland Firth, was gratified on reaching the Orkneys by find ing these islands in a state of greater improvement and civilisation than he had ventured to expect.

Throughout the whole pro gress, the voyage did not exhibit exclusively the stern aspect of a military expedition, but mingled the de light of the chase, of which James was passionately fond, with the graver cares and labours of the monarch and the legislator. The rude natives of these savage and distant regions flocked to the shore to gaze on the unusual apparition, as the fleet SAvept past their pro montories ; and the mountain and island lords crowded round the royal pavilion, Avhich was pitched upon the beach, to deprecate resentment and proffer their alle giance. The force which was aboard appears to have been amply sufficient to secure a prompt submission upon the part of those fierce chieftains who had hitherto bid defiance to all regular government ; and James, who dreaded lest the departure of the fleet should be a signal for a return to their former courses, insisted that many of them should accompany him to the capital, and remain there as hostages for the peace able deportment of their followers.1 Some of the most refractory were even throAvn into irons and con fined on board the ships, Avhilst others were treated with a kindness Avhich soon substituted the ties of affectionate allegiance for those of compulsion and terror.2 On reaching Dunbarton, the king considered 1 Lesley, p. 157.

Another conspiracy, the third within the last three years, was discovered, and its author, Sir James Hamilton, arrested and brought to trial on a charge of treason. This baron, who has been already men tioned as notorious for his cruelty in an age not fastidious in this respect, Avas the illegitimate son of the Earl of Arran, and had acquired over the early youth of the king an influence from which his more advanced judgment recoiled. Such, however, was his poAver and wealth, that it Avas dangerous to attempt any thing against him ; and as he was a zealous and bigoted supporter of the ancient religion, he could reckon on the friendship of the clergy. His temper was passionate in the extreme ; and during the king's minority had often hurried him into excesses, which, under a government Avhere the law was not a dead letter, might have cost him his head ; but he had hitherto escaped, and latterly had even experienced the king's favour. Such was the state of things when the monarch, who had left the capital to pass over to Fife, was hurriedly accosted by a stranger, who demanded a speedy and secret audience, as the business on which he had been sent was of immediate moment, and touched the king's life.

It w7as found that his accuser was James Hamilton of Kincavil, sheriff of Linlithgow, and brother to the early reformer, Patrick Hamilton, in whose miserable death Sir James had taken an active part. The crime of which he was arraigned was of old standing, though now revealed for the first time. It was asserted that Hamilton, along with Archibald Douglas of Kilspindy, Robert Leslie, and James Dou glas of Parkhead, had in the year 1528 conspired to slay the king, having communicated their project to the Earl of Angus, and his brother Sir George Douglas, who encouraged the atrocious design.2 Some authors have asserted that the intention of Hamilton Avas to murder James by breaking into the royal bed-chamber;3 but in the want of all contemporary record of the trial, it is only knoAvn that he Avas found guilty and instantly executed. His innocence he is said to have affirmed to the last,4 but no one lamented the death of a tyran nical baron, whose hands were stained by much in nocent and unavenged blood ; and the fate of the brave and virtuous Lennox, who had been murdered by him after giving up his sword, was still fresh in the recol lection of the people.5 After the execution, the monarch is represented by some of our historians as having become a stranger to his former pleasures, and a victim to the most gloomy suspicions ; his court, the retreat of elegant enjoyment, Avas for a while transformed into the solitary residence 1 Drummond, 110.

To preserve the 1 Drummond, 111."], [255, "1540. JAMES V. 249 peace with England, to support the church, now hourly becoming more alarmed by the acknowledged progress of the reformed opinions, to strengthen the authority of the crown, and humble the power of the nobles, were at this moment the leading features of the policy adopt ed by the Scottish monarch : and easy as it is to detect his errors when we, illuminated by the light of nearly three centuries of increasing knoAvledge, look back upon the past, it Avould scarcely be just to condemn that conduct which sought to maintain the independence of the kingdom, and the religion of his fathers against what he esteemed the attacks of heresy and revolution. When in France, in 1537, James had published at Rouen a revocation of all the grants of lands which, during his minority, had been alienated from the croAA'n; and he noAV followed this up by a measure, upon the strict justice of Avhich the want of contemporary evi dence precludes us from deciding. This was an act of annexation to the crown of all the isles north and south of the two Kentires, commonly called the Hebrides. That these districts had been the scenes of constant treason and open defiance of the laAArs, must be acknow ledged, and at this moment James retained in various prisons many of their chiefs, whose lives had been par doned on their surrender of their persons during his late expedition to his insular dominions. But whether it was just or prudent to adopt so violent a measure as to annex the Avhole of the isles to the crown as for feited lands may be doubted. To these also were added the Orkney aud Shetland isles, the seat of the rebellion of the Earl of Caithness, with the lordships of Douglas, Bonkill, Preston, Tantallon, CraAvford-Lindsay, Craw ford-John, Bothwell, Jedburgh forest, and the superi- ority of the county or earldom of Angus.

Having thus strengthened his hands by this large ac cession of influence, James attempted to conciliate the uneasy feelings of the aristocracy by a general act of amnesty for all crimes and treasons committed up to the day of its publication ; but unfortunately its healing effects were defeated by the clause which excepted the banished Earl of Angus, his brother Sir George Dou glas, and the Avhole body of their adherents. Nor was the sternness of regal legislation confined to the hated Douglases. The Catholic clergy, Avhose councils Avere gradually gaining influence in the bosom of the monarch, procured the passing of many severe statutes against heresy. To argue against the supreme authority, or to question the spiritual infallibility of the pope, was made a capital offence ; no person even suspected of entertaining heretical opinions Avas to be admitted to any office in the gOArernment, Avhilst those Avho had fled from judicial examination Avere to be held as confessed, and sentence passed against them. All private meetings or conventicles, where religious subjects Avere debated, Avere declared illegal ; reAvards were promised to those who revealed where they Avere held ; and such was the jealousy with which the church provided against the contamination of its ancient doctrines, that no Catholic was to be permitted to converse with any one who had at any time embraced heretical opinions, although he had repented of his apostacy and received absolution for his errors. It is more pleasing to notice that in the same parliament, the strongest exhortations Avere"], [257, "1540. JAMES V. 251 given to churchmen, both of high and low degree, to reform their lives and conversation ; Avhilst the contempt Avith which the services of religion had been lately regarded was traced directly to the dishonesty and misrule of the clergy, proceeding from their ignorance in divine and human learning and the licentiousness of their manners. For the more general dissemination of the knowledge of the laws amongst the inferior judges and the great body of the people, the acts of parliament were ordered to be printed from an authentic copy attested by the sign-manual of the clerk-register ; and an act passed at the same time against the casting doAvn of the images of the saints, informs us that the spirit of demolition, which afterwards gathered such strength, had already directed itself Avith an unhappy narroAvness of mind against the sacred edifices of the country.1 Other enactments in a wise spirit provided for the more universal and impartial administration of justice by the sheriffs and temporal judges throughout the realm. The abilities of deputies, or inferior judges, the education and election of notaries, and the ratifi cation of the late institution of the College of Justice, form the subjects of some important changes ; various minute regulations were introduced concerning the domestic manufactures and foreign commerce of the country, and to defend the kingdom against any sudden project for its invasion (a measure which the violent temper of Henry rendered by no means improbable) the strictest orders Avere given for the observance of the stated military musters, and the arming of all classes of the community. It was declared that the army of Scotland should fight on foot, that the yeomen 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 370."], [258, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1540. 252 Avho brought horses with them should only use them for carriages or baggage wagons, and that none should be permitted to be mounted in the host, except earls, barons, and great landed proprietors. Such leaders Avere directed to be armed in white harness, light or heavy according to their pleasure, and with the weapons becoming their rank ; Avhilst all persons whose fortune was below a hundred pounds of yearly rent, were to have a jack, or a halkrick,1 or brigantine, and gloves of plate, Avith pesane and gorget ; no Aveapons being ad mitted by the muster officer, except spears, pikes of six ells length, Leith axes, halberds, hand-bows and arrows, cross-bows, culverins, and tAvo-handed swords. Such in 1540 were the arms of the Scottish host ;2 and these cares for the increase of the military strength of his dominions were succeeded on the part of the king by more decided demonstrations. A proclamation was read in the capital, and forAvarded to every part of the country, by which all persons betAveen sixteen and sixty years of age were commanded to be ready on a warning of tAventy-four hours to join the royal banner, armed at all points ; and a train of sixteen great, and sixty lesser cannon was ordered to be fitted out, to take the field within twenty days after Easter. It may be doubted, liOAvever, Avhether such symptoms of impending hostility were not rather preventive than preparatory of war. The individual feelings of the sovereign at this moment appear to have been in favour of a reform in the church, a measure almost synony mous with a peace Avith England : he not only permitted, but encouraged and sanctioned by his presence, the celebrated play of Lindsay, which, under the name of a satire on the three estates, embodied a bitter attack 1 A corslet. 2 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 362."], [259, "1541.

Yet the same authority pronounces him a decided enemy to the power and interference of England in the internal administra tion of his kingdom ; and the queen, Avhose influence over her husband Avas increased at this time by the birth of another prince, was a devoted adherent of Rome. To counteract the disposition of the sovereign toAvards the Reformation, the great reliance of Beaton and the prelates was in the prospect of a Avar with England ; for the attainment of this object no industry and no intrigues were omitted, no sacrifice considered too dear; and it unfortunately happened, that the violence of Henry the Eighth, with the unrelenting enmity of the Scottish monarch against the Douglases, and that large portion of the nobility connected Avith them by alliance or by interest, presented the two kings Avith materials of mutual provocation, of Avhich they Avell kneAV hoAV to avail themselves. In the midst of these transactions the queen-mother was taken ill at Methven, the castle of her husband, and died after a varied and turbulent life, during the latter years of Avhich she had lost all influence in the affairs of the kingdom.

Her talents, had they not been enslaved to her caprice and passion, were of a high order, as is amply proved by that large and curious collection of her original letters preserved in our national archives ;x but the influence she exerted during the minority of her son was mischievous, and her individual character such as could not long command either affection or respect. She was interred with much solemnity and magnificence in the church of the Carthusians, at Perth, in the tomb of its founder, James the First. The decease of the queen was followed by an event which plunged the court and the people into sincere grief. Arthur duke of Albany, the infant prince whose birth had lately given such joy to his royal parents, was suddenly cut off at Stirling by some in fantine disease ; and scarcely had he ceased to breathe, when Prince James, the eldest born, and heir to the throne, was attacked with a similar malady, which defied all human skill, and hurried him within a brief period to share the grave of his brother.2 It was a Woav Avhich fell heavily upon the affections of the mo narch ; and, in a political point of view, its conse quences were equally distressing ; it shook the security of a sovereign who was at variance with his nobility, and whose throne needed, on that account, the sup port communicated by the certainty of succession; but James never permitted his cares and duties to be long interrupted by an excessive indulgence in sorrow, and he wisely sought for alleviation in an attention to those peaceful arts which were intimately connected 1 In the State-paper Office and the British Museum. 3 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 371."], [261, "JAMES V. 1541. 255 Avith the Avelfare of his kingdom. From France and Flanders, from Spain and Holland, he invited the most skilful artisans in those various branches of manufacture and industry wherein they excelled his subjects, inducing them by pensions to settle in the country ; he improved the small native breed of the Scottish horses by importations from Denmark and SAveden ; 1 and anxious for the encouragement of use ful learning, he visited the university of Aberdeen in company with his queen and his court, listened to the classic declamations of the students, and enjoyed the dramatic entertainments which Avere recited, during a residence of fifteen days, in this infant seat of the Scottish muses. On his return, a mission of Camp bell of Lundy to the Netherlands, for the redress of some grievances connected with the fisheries, and an embassy of Beaton, and Panter the secretary of the king, to Rome, evinced that the royal mind had re covered its wonted strength and activity. The avoAved object of the cardinal was to procure his nomination as papal legate within the dominions of his master; but there can be little doubt that his secret instruc tions, which unfortunately have not been preserved, embraced a more important design. The extirpation of heresy from Scotland, and the re-establishment of the Catholic faith in the dominions of Henry the Eighth, by a coalition between Francis, James, the emperor, and the papal see, formed, it is probable, the main purpose of Beaton's visit. Events, howrever, Avere noAV in progress, which counteracted his best laid schemes ; and the rupture which soon after took place between Francis and the emperor, for the pre sent dissolved the meditated confederacy. 1 Epistol\u00e6 Regum Scotorum, vol. ii. p. 36 : \u2014 \" Cataphractos aliquot e regno tuo desideramus.\""], [262, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 256 1541. It Avas this moment which the English monarch selected for a second embassy of Sadler to the court of his nepheAV ; and had Henry's instructions to his ambassador been less violent, a favourable impression might have been made ; but James, Avho never forgot his station as an independent prince, was not to be threatened into a compliance Avith a line of policy Avhich, if suggested in a tone of conciliation, his judg ment might perhaps have approved ; and if the Eng lish ambassador besought him not to \" be as brute as a stocke,\" or to suffer the practices of juggling prelates to lead him by the nose, and impose a yoke upon his shoulders, the spirit of the prince must have been roused by the insolence of such language to a deeper resentment than he had yet felt against his uncle.1 Yet, although inimical to the purposes of the embassy, the request of Henry, that James should meet him in a conference to be held on the borders, was received with a less marked opposition ; and before the depar ture of Sadler, the monarch appears to have given a reluctant assent to the interview.2 It, however, most inopportunely happened, that at this time the English borderers, not only with the approval, but under the guidance of the wardens, renewed, with every circum stance of cruelty and havock, their invasions of the Scottish territory ; and the king, disgusted with such contradiction and duplicity, presented a remonstrance, in Avhich he not only demanded redress, but declined the promised interview till it should be obtained.3 1 Pinkerton, vol. ii. p. 374.

To act on the resentment of the moment, and to permit the impatience of personal revenge to dictate the course of his policy, was the frequent failing of this monarch ; and there can be no doubt, that from the instant he found himself disappointed of the intended interview at York, Avar with Scotland was resolved on. In structions Avere despatched to Sir Robert Bowes, to levy soldiers and put the east and middle marches in a state of defence ; an army Avas ordered to be raised for immediate service in the north ; the fortifications of Berwick were inspected ; and the monarch, having determined to revive the idle and exploded claim of superiority, issued his commands to the archbishop of York, requesting him to make a search into the most ancient records and muniments within his diocese, so as to ascertain his title to the kingdom of Scotland.1 Some circumstances, however, for a short season delayed, although they could not prevent, an open rupture. James, from a deference to the opinion of his ecclesiastical counsellors, had disappointed Henry of the intended interview at York ; but he despatched an ambassador, whoAvas commissioned to express his regret on the occasion, in terms of respect and conciliation : Avhilst Beaton's devices being somewhat thwarted by the reneAval of the quarrel between Francis and the emperor, this ambitious minister required an interval to examine his ground, and alter his mode of attack. 1 State-paper Office.

B"], [264, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1542. 258 An event, however, which occurred about this time, was improved by the cardinal and the clergy, to bring about the desired Avar. The king had long maintained an intercourse in Ireland, not only with his Scottish subjects, who possessed a considerable portion of the island, but with many of the principal chiefs, in whose eyes the English monarch was a heretic and a tyrant. Hitherto, Henry's predecessors and himself had been contented to call themselves lords of that country; but, in a parliament of this year, he had assumed the more august style of King of Ireland1\u2014 a proceeding so ill-received by its native chiefs, that they sent a deputation to the Scottish court, inviting its monarch to accept their homage, and making a proffer of the croAvn, which had already, in ancient times, although for abrief period, been placed upon the head of a Scottish prince.2 It is not probable that the offer was ever viewed by James in a serious light ; yet, his assump tion of the title of Defender of the Faith, with Avhich the pope had condescended to flatter him, the gracious reception which he gave to the Irish chiefs, and his warlike preparations, which could not be concealed, excited the jealousy and resentment of the English king to so high a pitch, that it was evident war could not be long averted. Under such circumstances, nothing seemed wanting but a slight spark to ignite the mass Avhich had been accumulating for many years ; and this was soon furnished by the restless borderers. Upon Avhose side hostilities began seems uncertain; the Scottish monarch, in one of his letters, insisted, that before his subjects retaliated, they had been provToked by two English invasions; whilst the manifesto of Henry 1 Lesley, p. 160. 2 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 826."], [265, "JAMES V. 1542. 259 broadly imputed the first aggression to his nepheAV. Mutual incursions were probably succeeded by a mu tual wish to throw the odium of an infraction of the peace upon each other ; and, at the moment when Sir James Learmont had proceeded with a message of re gret and conciliation to the English court, Sir James BoAves, captain of Norham, and warden of the east marches, broke across the border, and, with a body of three thousand horse, penetrated into Teviotdale. He was accompanied by the banished Earl of Angus, Sir George Douglas, and a large body of their retainers; but the Earl of Huntley encountered him with a strong force at Hadden-Rig, and, with the assistance of Lord Home, who joined the host Avith four hundred lancers, obtained a complete victory. Six hundred prisoners of note fell into the hands of the enemy, amongst whom were the lord Avarden himself, and his brother. Angus was nearly taken, but slew his assailant with his dag ger, and saved himself by flight.1 Open and determined AArar appeared now inevitable; and Henry, having sent orders to the Duke of Norfolk to levy a force of forty thousand men, this able leader, Avho had obtained from his master the name of the Scourge of the Scots, proceeded by rapid marches to wards York. Along with him, each leading their respective divisions, came the Earls of Southampton, ShreAvsbury, Derby, Cumberland, Rutland, and Hert ford, Avith Angus, and some of his Scottish adherents ; but on their march, they were arrested by a deputation of commissioners, instructed by James to make a final effort for averting a war. Whether the Scottish king was sincere in this, or merely used it as an expedient to gain time, does not appear ; but as the season was 1 Maitlaud, vol. ii. p. 831. Lesley, p. 162."], [266, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 260 1542. far adA-anced, even a short delay was important ; and, in all probability, he had become convinced of the fatal effects which the dissatisfaction of his nobility with his late measures might produce upon the issue of the cam paign. He accordingly prevailed on Norfolk to halt at York, and amused him for a considerable period with proposals for a truce, and a personal interview, which had long been the great object of the English king. It was now, however, too late ; the conferences conducted to no satisfactory conclusion ; and Henry, issuing imperative orders to his lieutenant to advance into Scotland, published at the same moment a mani festo, in which he stated his reasons for engaging in war. His nephew, he affirmed, supported some of his chief rebels within his dominions ; his subjects had invaded England when a treaty of peace was in the course of negotiation ; he was refused the possession of some districts, to which he affirmed he had estab lished an unquestionable title ; and, lastly, James had disappointed him of the promised interview at York. These trifling causes of quarrel were folloAved up by a revival of the claim of superiority over Scotland, and a tedious enumeration of the false and exploded grounds upon Avhich it was maintained. The winter had now commenced ; yet Norfolk, aware of the impetuosity of his master's temper, penetrated into Scotland ; and finding no resistance, gave many of the granges and villages on the banks of the Tweed to the flames ; whilst James, becoming more aware of the secret indisposition of his nobles to a contest with England, once more despatched Learmont and the Bishop of Orkney to request a conference, and carry proposals of peace.1 All negotiation, however, was in 1 Lesley, p. 161."], [267, "JAMES V. 1542. 261 vain ; and commanding a force under Huntley, Home, and Seton, to watch the operations of Norfolk, the Scottish king himself assembled his main army, con sisting of thirty thousand men, on the Borough-muir, near Edinburgh.1 But, though strong in numbers and equipment, this great feudal array was Aveakened by various causes. It was led by those nobles Avho had regarded the late conduct of the king with sentiments of disapproval and even of indignation. Many of them favoured the doctrines of the Reformation ; some from a conscientious conviction of their truth, others from an envious eye to those possessions of the church, which, under the dissolution of the English religious houses, they had seen become the prey of their brethren in England ; many dreaded the severity of the new laAVS of treason, and trembled for their estates, when they considered they might thus be ren dered responsible for the misdeeds of their deceased predecessors ; others were tied by bands of manrent to the interests of the Douglases; and a few, who were loyal to the king, were yet anxious to adopt every honourable means of averting a war, from which, they contended, nothing could be expected, eATen should they be victorious, but an increase of those difficulties which perplexed the councils of the government. It appears also to have been a rule amongst these feudal barons, which, if not strictly a part of the military law, had been established by custom, that they were not bound to act offensively Avithin the territories of a foreign state, although their feudal tenure compelled them, under the penalty of forfeiture, to obey the royal command in repelling an enemy who had crossed the borders, and encamped within the kingdom. 1 Herbert, in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 232."], [268, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 262 1542. Such were the sentiments of the Scottish nobles when James lay with his army on Fala Muir, a plain near the western termination of the Lammermuir hills ; and intelligence was suddenly brought to the host, that Norfolk, compelled by the approach of Avinter and the failure of his supplies, had recrossed the border, and was in full retreat. It was now the end of November ; and such was the scarcity of pro visions produced by the recent devastation of the English, that, having consumed the allowances which they brought along with them, the Scottish army began to be severely distressed.1 Yet the opportunity for retaliation appeared too favourable to be lost, and the monarch eagerly proposed an invasion of England, wdien he was met with a haughty and unanimous refusal. The crisis recalls to our minds the circum stances in which James the Third was placed at Lauder bridge ; and it is even insinuated by some of our historians, that the nobles, who had been long secretly dissatisfied with the conduct of the king, meditated a repetition of the ferocious scenes which then occurred ; but they had to do with a more deter mined opponent, and contented themselves by a steady refusal, alleging as their reason, the advanced period of the year, and the impossibility of supporting so large a force. Yet this was enough to arouse to the highest pitch the indignation of the king: he alter nately threatened and remonstrated ; he implored them, as they valued their honour as knights, or esteemed their allegiance as subjects, to accompany him against the enemy ; he upbraided them as cowards and poltroons, who permitted Norfolk to burn their villages, and plunder their granges under their eyes, 1 Letter from the Duke of Norfolk to the Privy Council, dated 3d Nov. 1 .542.

But all was in vain : the leaders were immoveable ; the feudal feeling of loyalty to their prince, and revenge against their enemies, seemed to be extinguished by a determination to seize the opportunity to show their own strength, and use it for the redress of their grievances ; and the king, overwhelmed with disappointment and chagrin, dis banded the army and returned to his capital.1 Yet, although thus abandoned by a great majority of his nobles, the monarch Avas not without some supporters amongst them ; the opulent body of the clergy were unanimous in his favour, and a feAV peers, making an effort to recall their brethren to their duty, resolved to muster the army a second time, under what it was hoped would be more favourable auspices. For this purpose Lord Maxwell offered his services, and a force of ten thousand men having been assembled with great expedition and secrecy, it was determined to break into England by the Avestern marches ; whilst the monarch, with the sanguine and energetic temper by which he was distinguished, shook off the anguish which preyed on his mind, and eagerly awaited at Caerlaverock the result of the invasion. He had given secret orders, that his favourite, Oliver Sinclair, should take the command of the little army, so soon as it reached the Esk ; and scarcely had the soldiers encamped on English ground, when a halt was order ed, and this minion of the king, as he is termed in a contemporary document, was raised on a platform, supported on the shoulders of the troops, Avhilst the royal commission appointing him generalissimo was read aloud by a herald. The intelligence was received with murmurs of disapprobation ; many of the ancient 1 John Car to My Lord of Norfolk, 1st Nov. 1542, State-pajer Office."], [270, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 264 1542. nobility declared they could not serve without degra dation under such a leader ; their clansmen and re tainers adopted their feelings; and whilst MaxAvell, and a few of the most loyal peers, attempted to over come their antipathy, the whole army became agitated with the discussion, presenting the spectacle of a dis orderly mob tossed by conflicting sentiments and ready to fall to pieces on the slightest alarm. It was at this crisis that Dacre and Musgrave, tAvo English leaders, advanced to reconnoitre, at the head of three hundred horse ; and approaching the Scottish camp, became sensible of its situation : nor did they delay a moment to seize the opportunity, but charged at full speed with levelled lances, and in a compact body. In the panic of the moment, they were believed to be the adA'ance of a larger force ; and such was the effect of the sur prise, that the rout was instantaneous and decisive. Ten thousand Scottish troops fled at the sight of three hundred English cavalry, with scarce a momentary resistance ; and a thousand prisoners fell into the hands of the enemy, amongst whom were the Earls of Cassillis and Glencairn,the Lords Somerville, Maxwell, Gray, Oliphant, and Fleming, the Masters of Erskine and Rothes, and Home of Ayton.1 The intelligence of this second calamity fell like a thunderbolt upon the king ; he had awaited at Caer laverock, in the most eager expectation, the first intel ligence from the army ; he trusted that the success of the invasion would wipe away, in some degree, the dishonour of the retreat from Fala ; and he anticipated with sanguine hope and resolution the renewal of the Avar, and a restoration of the feelings of cordiality and attachment between himself and his barons.

JAMES V. 265 instant every prospect of this kind was blasted ; and in the first agony of the moment, he embraced an idea which overthrew the balance of his mind, and plunged him into despair : he became convinced, that his nobi lity had entered into a conspiracy to betray him to England, to sacrifice their own honour, and the inde pendence of the kingdom, to the determination to gra tify their revenge against the crown and their personal hatred to himself.1 At Fala, they had disgraced him by an open contempt of his command ; at Solway, they had followed up the blow by an act Avhich exposed themselves, their sovereign, and the Scottish name, to ridicule and contempt. James had often borne mis fortune, but his mind was too proud and impatient to endure dishonour, or to digest the anguish of reiterated disappointment ; and although in the vigour of his strength and the flower of his age, with a constitution unimpaired and almost unvisited by disease, he sunk under this calamity, and seems truly to have died of a broken heart. From the moment the intelligence reached him, he shut himself up in his palace at Falk land, and relapsed into a state of the deepest gloom and despondency ; he would sit for hours without speaking a word, brooding over his disgrace, or would awake from his lethargy, only to strike his hand on his heart, and make a convulsive effort, as if he Avould tear from his breast the load of despair which oppressed it. Exhausted by the violence of the exertion, he would then drop his arms by his side, and sink into a state of hopeless and silent melancholy.

When in this state, intelligence was brought him that his queen had giATen birth to a daughter.1 At another time it would have been happy news ; but now, it seemed to the poor monarch the last drop of bitterness Avhich was reserved for him. Both his sons were dead. Had this child been a boy, a ray of hope, he seemed to feel, might yet have visited his heart : he received the mes- senger, and was informed of the event without welcome or almost recognition ; but wandering back in his thoughts to the time when the daughter of Bruce brought to his ancestor the dowery of the kingdom, observed, with melancholy emphasis, \" It came with a lass, and it will pass with a lass.\"2 A few of his most favoured friends and counsellors stood round his couch; the monarch stretched out his hand for them to kiss ; and regarding them for some moments with a look of great sweetness and placidity, turned himself upon the pillow and expired.3 He died (13th December, 1542)4 in the thirty-first year of his age, and the twenty-ninth of his reign, leaving an only daughter, Mary, an infant of six days old, who succeeded to the crown, and, amongst other natural children, a son, James, afterwards the famous Regent Moray. There Avere some striking points of similarity between the character and destiny of this prince, and his great ancestor, James the First.

The total rout of the Scottish army at the Solway Moss, and the death of James the Fifth within a fort night after that event, produced the most important changes in the policy of both kingdoms. To Henry the Eighth, and that powerful faction of the Douglases, Avhich, even in banishment, had continued to exert, by its secret friends, a decided influence in Scottish affairs, the death of the king was a subject of fervent congra tulation. The English monarch immediately embraced, with the enthusiasm belonging to his character, the design of marrying his son, the Prince of Wales, to the infant Mary, hoping by this means to unite the two kingdoms, which had so long been the enemies of each other, into one povverful monarchy in the persons of their descendants. The Earl of Angus and the Douglases, after a banishment of fifteen years, joyfully contemplated the prospect of a return to their native country ; they had become subjects of the English monarch; had largely shared his bounty and protection; and Henry determined to put their gratitude to the test by claiming their assistance in fonvarding his"], [275, "1542. MARY. 269 great scheme of procuring the Princess Mary for his son, and incorporating the kingdom of Scotland into the English monarchy ; but, in the prosecution of this design, the king employed other agents. On their first arrival in London, the Scottish prisoners w7ho were taken at the Solway Moss found themselves treated with great severity ; they were paraded through the streets of the metropolis, conducted to the Tower, and watched with much jealousy ; but as soon as the in telligence arrived of the death of their master the king, an immediate and favourable change in their condition took place. Their high rank and influence in Scot land convinced Henry that they might be useful and even necessary agents to him in the accomplishment of his designs ; the rigour of their confinement was accordingly relaxed ; and they now experienced not only kindness, but were entertained with hopes of a speedy return to their country, on condition they for warded the designs of the English king. Sir George Douglas, the brother of Angus, who had shared his long banishment, and was much in the confidence of Henry, appears to have been intrusted with the prin cipal share in negotiating the marriage. His talents for the management of political affairs Avere superior to those of his brother the earl, over whose mind he possessed great influence ; and if we may believe the expressions which he employed in his correspondence with Henry, he appears to have forgotten his allegi ance to his natural prince in the humility of his homage and the warmth of his devotion to the English mo narch.1 1 Original letter of Sir G. Douglas, in State-paper Office, dated January 10, 1642-3, to Lord Lisle the English warden : \u2014 \" yff it pleases God that I continewe withe lyff and helthe, I shall do my soverand lord and maister gud servyce be the helpe of God ; and yff I dey, I shall depart his trewe servand.\""], [276, "270 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1542. The project of a marriage between young Edward and the Scottish queen was in itself so plausible, and, if concluded upon an equitable basis and with a just attention to the mutual rights and independence of each country, appeared so likely to be attended with the happiest results, that it required little argument to recommend it to the Scottish prisoners, even had they not seen in it the only road by which they were to escape from their captivity ; but whilst all can under stand their readiness to promote a matrimonial alliance, and a perpetual union between the two kingdoms, had Henry confined his views to such a general design, the conduct pursued by that monarch, and the conditions which he offered, were such as no man of independent and patriotic feelings could, without ignominy, have embraced. He insisted that they should acknowledge him as lord superior of the kingdom of Scotland ; that the prisoners should exert their influence to procure for him the government of the kingdom, and the im mediate resignation of all its fortresses into his hands; that they should use their utmost efforts to have the infant queen delivered into his power, to be kept in Eugland ;x and, in the event of such demands being refused by the parliament of Scotland, he stipulated that their whole feudal strength was to be employed in co-operating with his army, and completing the conquest of the country. Nor did the English monarch content himself Avith the bare promise of his prisoners to fulfil his wishes: the affair was transacted with much rigour and solemnity. A bond or obligation was drawn up, which engrossed these stipulations. To this they were required to subscribe their names, and confirm it by their oath ; they were to leave their 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. pp. 69, \"4, 75, 81."], [277, "MARY 1542 271 \u25a0eldest sons, or nearest relatives, in their place as pledges for their fidelity ; should they fail in accomplishing the wishes of the king, they were to return to their prisons in England, on his so requiring it ; or, if he judged it more profitable for the accomplishment of his design, they wTere to remain in Scotland and assist him in the war.1 The bond, in short, contained terms which virtually annihilated the existence of Scotland as a separate kingdom ; and sad as is the fate of the captive, I am not prepared to admit that the Scottish prisoners were placed in a situation which called for hesitation. They were called upon to choose whether they were to preserve unsullied their individual honour, and maintain their national independence, by remaining in prison, and braving a captivity which the cruelty of Henry might render perpetual ; or whether they were to return dishonoured to their country, bound by the most solemn obligation to employ their strength in reducing it to the condition of a province of England. Under such circumstances, the citizen of a free country ought to have felt that he had only one resolution to adopt ; and it is with sorrow it must be declared, this resolution was not the one embraced by the Scottish nobles. Unable to endure the thoughts of remaining in England, the Earls of Glencairn and Cassillis, with the Lords Maxwell, Somerville, and Oliphant, agreed to the conditions upon which Henry per mitted them to revisit their country ; subscribed the bond, by which, to use the words of the gOATernor, Arran, they were tied in fetters to England ; con firmed it with their oath ; and having left hostages in the hands of that monarch, prepared to set out on their return.2 On their arrival, they cautiously abstained from revealing the full extent of their obliga- 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 97. !

At the same time it is not to be forgotten, in justice to the Scottish aristocracy, that whilst its leading members did not scruple to sign this unworthy agreement, the majority of the prisoners taken at the Solway remained in captivity in England. It cannot, howeA'er, be affirmed with certainty that to them Henry had pre sented the same temptation which overcame the virtue of their more Avealthy and influential brethren. I have been thus minute in describing the transaction which took place between the English monarch and his prisoners, because it was afterwards attended with important consequences, and has not been noticed by any former historian with either the care or the full reprobation which it deserves. Whilst such was the policy adopted by Henry, the sudden death of James the Fifth gave rise to a very opposite course of events in Scotland ; it left that country once more exposed to all the evils of a mino rity, and divided by tAvo great parties. Of these, the first, and that which had hitherto been the strongest, was the body of the Catholic clergy, at the head of which stood the Cardinal Beaton, a man possessed certainly of high talents, and far superior in habits of business, acquaintance with human character, and the energetic pursuit of his purposes, to his opponents, but profligate in his private conduct, insatiable in his love of power, and attached to the Roman Catholic faith with a devotedness AA'hich, without any breach of charity, Ave may pronounce as much the offspring of ambition as the result of conviction. Of this fac tion the guiding principles Avere a determined opposi tion to the progress of the Reformation, and a devotion to the papal see, \u2014 friendship with France, hostility to"], [279, "MARY 1542 273 England ; and a resolution, Avhich all must applaud, of preserving the ancient independence of their country. To them the late king, more from political motives than any thing like personal bigotry, had lent the impor tant strength of the royal favour and countenance. In the ranks of the opposite faction were found a considerable portion of the nobility, of AAdiom many of the leading chiefs favoured the doctrines of the Refor mation, whilst all had viewed wuth alarm the late severe measures of the king. They were led by the Earl of Arran \u2014 a man of an amiable disposition, but indolent in his habits, and unhappily of that undecided temper which unfitted him to act with energy and success in times of so much confusion and difficulty. His bias to the reformed opinions was well known, and his royal rank, as nearest in succession to the crown, compelled him to assume an authority from which his natural character was inclined to shrink. It was to this party, Avhose weight was noAV to be increased by the accession of Angus and the Douglases, that Henry looked for his principal supporters ; and considering the promises which he had received from the prisoners taken at the Solway Moss, he entertained little doubt of carrying his project in the Scottish parliament. With regard to the great body of the people, of which Ave must remember that the middle and commercial classes alone possessed any influence in the govern ment, they appear to have been animated at this time by somewhat discordant feelings. Many favoured the principles of the Reformation ; and, so far as these were concerned, gave a negative support to Henry by their hostility to the cardinal and his party ; but their sense of national independence, and their jealousy of Eng laud as the ancient enemy of their country, was a deep seated feeling, which was ready to erect itself into active vol. iv. a"], [280, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 274 1542. opposition on the slightest assumption of superiority by the rival kingdom. The conviction of this ought to have put Henry on his guard ; but it was the fre quent misfortune of this monarch, to lose his highest advantages by the arrogance and violence with Avhich he pursued them. Immediately after the death of the king, the cardinal produced a paper which he declared to be the will of the late monarch. It is asserted by most of our historians, and the story was confirmed by the positive testimony of the Earl of Arran,1 that this was a forged instru ment, procured by guiding the king's hand upon the paper Avhen he Avas in his last extremity, and utterly insensible to its contents. It is certain that it ap pointed Beaton guardian to the infant queen, and chief governor of the realm, with the assistance of a council composed of the Earls of Argyle, Huntley, and Moray, all of whom were devoted to his service ; and without giving his opponents time or opportunity to examine its provisions, or ascertain its authenticity, the cardi nal had himself proclaimed regent, and hastened to assume the active management of the state. But his power, though great, was not sufficient to support him for above a few days in so bold a usurpation : the no bility assembled, and Arran, rousing himself from his constitutional indolence, claimed the office of regent, insisting that by law it belonged to him as next heir to the crown ; 2 the pretended will he described as a 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 138. 2 Knox, History, p. 35.

He was chosen governor, and solemnly installed in his office on the 22d of December, 1542. Arrangements were then made for the maintenance of the household of the young queen, and her mother the queen-dowager ; whilst it was determined that the Earl of Angus and the Douglases, who had been doomed to so long a banishment in England, should be restored to their possessions, and admitted to that share in the govern ment which belonged to their high rank. A remark able circumstance increased the power and popularity of Arran, and the dread with which the country re garded the cardinal. Upon the king's person, at the time of his death, was found a secret scroll, containing the names of above three hundred and sixty of the nobility and gentry who were suspected of entertaining heretical opinions, and whose estates on this ground were recommended to be confiscated for the support of the king.1 This private list, it was affirmed, had been furnished by Beaton, immediately after the refusal of the army to invade England ; and although James re jected, on a former occasion, all such proposals, as a base project of the clergy to sow dissensions between him self and his nobles, it Avas suspected that his resolution had, after the rout of the Solway, given way to the entreaties of the cardinal. At the head of these names stood Arran ; and it may easily be believed that, with those of the common people who favoured the Refor mation, and the nobles Avho were enemies to the church of Rome, such a discovery produced a community of interests and an inveteracy of feeling which added no little strength to the party of the governor. 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 94."], [282, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 276 1542. Although defeated in his first attempt to seize on the supreme power, Beaton was not discouraged. He despatched messengers to France, representing to the house of Guise the crisis to which affairs had arrived in Scotland, the extreme danger attending a union between the Prince of Wales and their infant queen, the peril Avhich threatened the church, and the necessity of an immediate supply of money, arms, and soldiers, to enable him to maintain the struggle against his opponents:1 he worked upon the fears of those whom he knew to be sincere lovers of their country, by assur ing them that the marriage which was now talked of so lightly, was nothing less than a project for the entire destruction of Scotland as an independent king dom ; and he procured the support of the middle and commercial classes by reminding them of the unpro voked seizure of their merchantmen by Henry, during a time of peace, declaiming against the injustice which prompted that prince still to detain their vessels and enrich himself with their cargoes. All these means Avere not without effect ; and it began to be suspected that, notwithstanding his first repulse, the simplicity and indolence of Arran would not long be able to hold its ground against the energy of so talented and daring an enemy as the cardinal. Such appears to have been the state of parties when the Scottish prisoners, the Earls of Cassillis and Glen cairn, with the Lords Fleming, Maxwell, Somerville, and Oliphant, took their departure from London. They Avere preceded in their journey by Angus and Sir George Douglas, Avho left the English court ten days before them, and posted down to Edinburgh for the purpose of conducting the first and most delicate part of the negotiation regarding the marriage. On their 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 138."], [283, "1542-3 MARY. 277 arrival a council was held by the governor, in Avhich the projected matrimonial alliance between the king doms Avas discussed in a general manner, and received with that favourable consideration with which at first sight all were disposed to regard it. It is here neces sary to keep in mind that Sir George Douglas, who was the main agent of the English monarch in this negotiation, had three great objects in view, all of which he seems to have pursued with a prudence and diplomatic craft which prove him to have been no mean adept in the management of state intrigue. The reversal of his own and his brother's treason, and their restoration to their estates, was to be his first step ; the procuring the consent of the Scottish par liament to the marriage, the second ; and the last and most important of all, the obtaining the delivery to Henry of the person of the infant queen, the surrender of the fortresses of the kingdom, and the consent of the three estates to have the country placed under the government of England. It is certain, from the authentic correspondence which yet remains, that Dou glas and some of the Scottish prisoners had promised the English king their utmost endeavours to attain O \u00a9 all these objects, the last of which amounted to an act of treason ; but they were compelled to proceed Avith great wariness. They knew well that the first men tion of such ignominious conditions would rouse the country and the parliament to a determined opposi tion,1 and that all Avho Avould have Avelcomed upon fair 1 See the Letter in the State-paper Office.

It became necessary, therefore, to feel their way and commence with caution; so that, at the council which Avas held immediately after their return to Edinburgh, no whisper of such ultimate designs Avas suffered to escape them. All their efforts, however, could not prevent the cardinal from becoming acquainted with their in trigues, and the use which he made of this knowledge, in strengthening his party, convinced them that, if so active an enemy Avere left at large, they could hardly hope for success : a secret resolution was, therefore, formed, and executed with that daring promptitude Avhich so often leads to success, Beaton, whose cor respondence with France was construed into treason, was suddenly arrested, (20th January, 1542-3,) and, before he had time to summon his friends, or protest against such injustice, hurried to the castle of Black ness, and committed to the custody of Lord Seton.1 Having thus boldly begun, proclamation was made, that every man, under pain of treason, should resist the landing of any army from France ; a suspicion having arisen, that a fleet which had been seen off Holy Island was a squadron led by the Duke of Guise, for the invasion of Scotland. It soon appeared, however, to be some Scottish ships of war, with nine teen English prizes, which they afterwards brought 1 Keith, p. 27. Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 26.

A parliament was appointed to be held on the 12th of March for the discussion of the proposed alliance with England, and the condem nation of the cardinal ; whilst it was proposed that Henry should immediately grant an abstinence of war, and a safe-conduct to the Scottish ambassadors, AA'ho were to conclude a perpetual peace between the two realms. The seizure of the cardinal, however, was attended with effects which his opponents had not anticipated. The public services of religion were suspended ; the priests refused to administer the sacraments of baptism and burial ; the churches were closed : a universal gloom overspread the countenances of the people ; and the country presented the melancholy appearance of a land excommunicated for some awful crime. The days, indeed, were past, when the full terrors of such a state of spiritual proscription could be felt, yet the Catholic party were still strong in Scotland ; they loudly exclaimed against their opponents for so daring an act of sacrilege and injustice ; and the people began, in some degree, to identify the cause of Beaton with the independence of the country, exclaiming against the Douglases and the Scottish prisoners as the pensioners of England.1 It Avas suspected that more was concealed under the proposed marriage and alliance Avith England than the friends of Henry dared as yet avoAV : cabals were formed amongst the nobles; and the Earls of Huntley, Bothwell, and 1 Letter, State-paper Office, Sir Thomas Wharton to the Duke of Suffolk, Carlisle, February 2, 1542-3.

Moray, offering themselves as surety for the appear ance of the cardinal to ansAver the charges against him, imperiously demanded that he should be set at liberty. The refusal of this request by the governor and the Douglases convinced their opponents that their suspicions were not without foundation : Argyle, one of the ablest and most powerful amongst the barons, retired to his own country, Avith the object of mustering his strength, and providing for the storm Avhich he saw approaching ; whilst the mutual jeal ousies and animosities amongst those left behind gathered strength so rapidly, that it seemed probable they must lead to some alarming civil commotion.1 This fatal result was likely to be hastened by the conduct of the English king. Incensed to the utmost \u00a9 D degree against the cardinal, whom the pope had recently appointed legate a latere in Scotland, he insisted on his being delivered into his hands to be imprisoned in England.2 He pressed the Earl of Angus and his Scottish prisoners to fulfil their pro mises regarding the surrender of the fortresses, and was highly dissatisfied when he found his orders not likely to be obeyed.

He assured him that if the king were content to proceed Avith caution, he had little doubt of accom plishing his utmost wishes, but that at present the delivery of the cardinal, or the slightest attempt to seize the fortresses, would lead to certain failure. In the meantime he promised that Beaton, against Avhose talent and intrigue they could never be too much on their guard, should be as safely kept Avith them as he could be in England ; and as the report still continued that the Duke of Guise was about to visit Scotland,1 he agreed, at the suggestion of Lord Lisle, to alter their first resolution, which had been to grant this prince an interview, and to adopt the safer plan of interdicting him or his attendants from landing in any of the harbours of the kingdom. Convinced, or at least assuming the appearance of being satisfied by such representations, Henry consented to the prolon gation of the abstinence of Avar till the month of June,2 and aAvaited, with as much patience as he could com mand, the meeting of the Scottish parliament. In the meantime he sent orders to Sir Ralph Sadler to repair instantly as his ambassador to Edinburgh, and he determined to keep a jealous watch on the proceedings of France, as it was iioav confidently asserted that the Duke of Guise and the Earl of Lennox had fitted out an expedition against Scotland in some of the ports of Normandy.3 1 Letter, State-paper Office, the Duke of Suffolk and council of the north to the privy council, advising them of the appearance of a large fleet off Holy Island, supposed to be the Duke de Guise's squadron, dated at Newcastle, 3d February, 1542-3. s Original agreement of abstinence of war, signed by James earl of Arran as governor of Scotland, (State-paper Office,) dated Feb. 20, 1542-3, in the name of Mary queen of Scotland ; also, copy Agree ment for Cessation of Hostilities on the part of Henry the Eighth. 3 Privy-council of England to the Duke of Suffolk, March 13,"], [288, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 282 1543. Shortly before the meeting of parliament, an attempt was made by the Catholic party to counteract the in trigues of the English faction, which had now gained a complete command over the governor. The Earls of Huntley, Moray, Bothwell, and Argyle, supported by a powerful body of the barons and landed gentry, and a numerous concourse of bishops and abbots, assembled at Perth, avowing their determination to resist the measures of the governor and the Douglases. They despatched Reid the Bishop of Orkney, a prelate of primitive simplicity and integrity, with certain pro posals to their opponents. Of these, the first insisted that the cardinal should be set at liberty, and that the New Testament should not be read in the vulgar tongue by the people ; they demanded, at the same time, that the Scottish ambassadors who had been named by Henry should not be intrusted with the negotiation of the marriage, but others chosen in their stead; and they asserted their right to be consulted by the governor in all affairs of importance. It was not to be expected that Arran or his haughty counsellors should for a moment listen to such a message. It was received with a scornful and positive refusal ; and scarce had its authors time to recover from their dis appointment, when they saw a herald-at-arms enter their assembly, who, in the name of the gOATernor, and under the pain of treason, charged them to disperse their convocation and return to their duty and alle giance.

On the day previous to the meeting of the three estates, the Earl of Huntley sent in his adhe rence to the governor, and under an assurance of safety repaired to the capital to give his presence in the parliament : his example was followed by all the clergy assembled at Perth, as well as by the Earls of Moray and Bothwell ; whilst Argyle, prevented by sickness from repairing to the parliament in person, sent his procuratory and his two uncles to plead his apology. They had evidently miscalculated their strength, and observing the number and the vigour of their opponents, deemed it prudent not to push matters to extremity, trusting, by their influence in the great council of the nation, to neutralize the obsequious spirit of the English faction, and if they consented to the marriage, to fetter it at least with such conditions as should insure the independence of their country ; nor were they disappointed in their endeavours.1 1 These important particulars of the meeting held at Perth by the rival lords, previous to the parliament, are new to Scottish history. They are collected from an original letter preserved in the State-paper Office, dated March 16, 1542-3, addressed by the Earl of Angus and his brother Sir George Douglas to Lord Lisle. It will be published in its entire state in the volume of Scottish Correspondence during the reign of Henry the Eighth, which is about to be printed by govern ment ; in the meantime a short extract may not be uninteresting to the reader : \u2014 \"The Parliament began the 12th of March, and the ouke before, thare convenit in the toune of Perth th' Erles of Huntley, Ergyle, Murray, and Boithwell, with ane gret noumer of bishoppis and abbotis, baronis and knightis, and so the forsaidis lordis sent the Bischop of Orkney, and Sir John Campbell of Caldour, knycht, uncle to the Erie of Ergyle, with certane artiklis to my lord governour and counsale being with him.

These, however, were widely different from Avhat Henry had expected. The parliament refused to deliver the queen till she had attained the full age of ten years ; they declined to surrender any of the fortresses of the kingdom ; and the whole deliberations were conducted with a jealous attention to the preservation of the liberties of Scot land as a separate and independent kingdom. That realm was to retain its name, its laws, its ancient courts, officers, and immunities. It was stipulated that, even after the marriage was concluded, whether there was issue or not, the kingdom of Scotland should continue to be governed by a native ruler ; and the proviso was subjoined, that in the event of the failure of the heirs of such marriage, the nearest lawful successor should immediately succeed to the crown, without question or difficulty.1 Under such restric tions the proposal of a matrimonial alliance was Avelcomed as likely to produce the most favourable effects on the mutual prosperity of both kingdoms ; and Balnaves the secretary, Sir James Learmont the treasurer, with Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar, were chosen as ambassadors to the court of England. The parliament then proceeded to reA'erse the at tainder of Angus and the Douglases, restoring them to \u00a9 \u00a9 ' \u00a9 their estates and their honours : they selected the Earls Marshal and Montrose, with the Lords Erskine, Ruth ven, Lindsay, Livingston, and Seton, to be keepers of the queen's person ; they appointed the governor a council, which was far too numerous to be efficient ; and they determined that, for the present, the young queen should hold her court, under the eye of her 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. pp. 411, 412, 413."], [292, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 286 1543. mother the queen-dowager, at the palace of Linlithgow. Parliament was then prorogued to the 17th of March, whilst the committee, known by the name of the Lords of the Articles, continued their sittings for the introduction of such statutes as Avere esteemed beneficial to the general interests of the kingdom. Amongst these one provision stands pre-eminent for its important effects in spreading the light of truth, and accelerating the progress of the Reformation. Lord Maxwell, Avhen a prisoner in England, had be come a convert to its doctrines, and proposed that all might have liberty to read the Bible in an approved Scots or English translation, provided none disputed on the controATerted opinions. Against this the Arch bishop of Glasgow solemnly protested, for himself and the ecclesiastical estate in parliament, till the matter should be debated in a provincial council; but the proposition obtained the consent of the Lords of the Articles, and was publicly ratified by the governor. Arran, indeed, was at this time esteemed, to use the words of Knox, one of the most fervent Protestants in Europe. He entertained in his service two cele brated preachers, Friar Williams and John Rough, who inveighed with much severity against the corrup tions of the Romish church ; and under his protection the Holy Scriptures began to be studied very generally throughout the couutry. Sadler, the English ambassador, now arrived in Edinburgh, and with great diplomatic ability earnestly laboured to obtain more favourable terms. No effort was left untried to shake the resolution and corrupt the integrity of the governor : his fears were attempted to be roused by threats of war; his ambition was worked on by the promise of a marriage between his son and the Princess Elizabeth of England : but, al-"], [293, "1543 MARY 287 though indolent and timid as a politician, Arran possessed a high sense of honour, and no persuasions could induce him to depart from the resolution of the three estates. Nor was Sadler more successful with others to whom he applied. In a letter to the king, written a short time after the prorogation of the par liament, he lamented that his utmost endeavours were insufficient to bring them to consent to the wishes of his master. They would rather, he assured Henry, suffer any extremity than come to the obedience and subjection of England, being determined to have their realm free and to retain their ancient laws and cus toms ; yet he acknowledged that the nobles and the whole temporality desired the marriage, and were anxious to remain at peace, whilst he expressed an opinion that this event Avould be folloAved by a renun ciation of their alliance with France, and might pos sibly, in the progress of time, induce them to fall to the obedience and devotion of England. In the same despatch, hoAvever, the enmity of the churchmen to the marriage and union Avith England is represented as deep and universal.1 The haughty temper of the English monarch was irritated by the opposition to his favourite scheme, and the measures which he adopted were violent and im politic. He upbraided Angus, Glencairn, and the rest of his prisoners, with a breach of their promises ; he assured them that he had no intention to recede from even the smallest portion of his demands, and that, if necessary, he Avould by force compel the Scots to de liver to him their infant queen, in which case they must 1 Sir R.

Beaton, who since his imprisonment had not ceased to keep up a communication with his party, contrived suddenly, and someAvhat mysteriously, to recover his liberty. He had been delivered by Arran into the custody of Lord Seton, a near relative of the Hamil tons, but a nobleman distinguished for his hereditary loyalty and his attachment to the Catholic faith. This peer, if we may believe the asseverations of the gover nor, under pretence of inducing Beaton to deliver up his castle of St Andrews, permitted the cardinal to remove from Blackness to this fortress. Thither he was accompanied by Seton, but with so small a force that the prelate, instead of a captive, remained master in his OAvn palace ; and as no attempt was made to punish or even to examine his keeper, it is difficult to resist the inference that Arran was secretly not displeased at his escape.1 Hamilton abbot of Paisley, the natural brother of the governor, and an ecclesiastic of considerable political ability, had returned from France a short time previous to the enlargement of Beaton,2 and was probably concerned in the plot AA'hich led to his liberation. It is at least certain that he soon exercised a considerable influence over the vacillating mind of the governor, and the cardinal endeavoured through his means to promote a coalition between their parties. He declared himself anxious, by every laAvful means, to support the government, repelled Avith indig nation the assertion that he had entered into any 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 137. 2 Ibid. vol. i. p. 117."], [295, "MARY 1543 289 treasonable correspondence with France, and declared himself ready at any time to surrender his person for the trial of his innocency.1 He even despatched his chaplain to Sadler, the English ambassador, with the object of removing from the mind of his master, the King of England, the violent prejudices which had been conceived against him. None, he affirmed, was more ready than himself to acknoAvledge the beneficial effects Avhich must result from a union between the two kingdoms; to accomplish which he Avould serve the English monarch as sincerely as any of his supporters: Avith this only difference, that he Avould fulfil his duty to the country of which he was a subject, and anxi ously provide for the preservation of its freedom and independence.2 It is difficult to estimate the exact proportion of sincerity which entered into these pro fessions, but the last condition was directly opposed to the imperious projects of Henry, who imagined the time had arrived when Scotland was for ever to be incorporated with the English monarchy. He rejected them, accordingly, with ill advised precipitation ; and both parties became aware that, unless some unforeseen changes took place, all hope of an amicable issue was at an end. In the meantime the Scottish ambassadors arrived at the English court, and, on being admitted to their audience, explained to the monarch the conditions upon Avhich the parliament were ready to give their consent to a marriage.3 Henry declared himself deeply dis satisfied : he first insisted on the immediate delivery of the infant queen, but aftenvards relaxed so far in 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 131. a Sadler's State Papers, pp. 131, 133. 3 They set off from Edinburgh on the 23d of March, 1542-3.

Such demands the Scottish ambassadors resisted with firm ness ; and in a subsequent meeting with the English commissioners to confer upon the marriage, they did not conceal their opinion, that the first notice of such terms would render any treaty between the two coun tries completely impracticable. Nor were they deceived in their expectations : the extraordinary demands of Henry were received in Scotland with a universal burst of indignation ; and the anticipations of the Douglases and their faction, who had in vain besought him to unveil his designs more cautiously, were completely fulfilled. Even the governor, who Avas described by Sir George Douglas to Sadler as a very gentle creature, resented, with becoming spirit, the indignity with which he had been treated ; and Beaton gained from the vio lence and indiscretion of his adversary a strength and popularity which some months before he had in vain attempted to acquire by his own efforts. The cardinal was not slow in availing himself of this advantage. Some time previous to this the Earl of Lennox had returned to Scotland, by the advice of the cardinal, and Avith the concurrence of Francis the First, in Avhose Italian wars he had received his education.2 1 It is to be regretted that there should be a revival of this question in the present day ; but to those who feel any interest in the contro versy, I would recommend the able \" Vindication of the Independence of Scotland,\" by Mr Allen.

The near relationship between this young noble and the royal family, and a report which was circulated at this time that the late king, in the event of his dying without children, had selected him as his successor in the throne, excited the jealousy and ap prehensions of the governor. Beaton, on the other hand, did not scruple to encourage the ambition of Lennox 1/ holding out the hope of a marriage with the queen-dowager ; and it was even hinted by the clergy, that in consequence of some informality in the divorce between the father of Arran and his second wife, the governor, who was the issue of a third mar riage, had no legitimate title either to his paternal property, or to the high office which he held. Could this have been made out, Lennox was unquestionably not only the next heir to these immense estates, but possessed, on the same grounds, a preferable claim to the regency; and it is easy to understand how all these con curring circumstances must have shaken the resolution of Arran, and rendered Lennox a formidable instrument in the hands of so artful a politician as the cardinal.1 These, however, A\\*ere far from the only means which he employed. He had early opened a negotiation with France ; and Francis the First, aware of the impor tance of preserving his amicable relations with Scotland, empowered Lennox to promise assistance, both in arms and money, to the party opposed to Henry. He took every opportunity of enlisting upon his side the affec tions and the prejudices of the middle and the lower classes of the people ; promulgating, through the me dium of the clergy, the insolent demands of the English 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 842."], [298, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1543. 292 monarch, and exciting their resentment against those persons amongst the nobility, Avhom he justly repre sented as having sold to Henry their services against their native country. The consequences of all this were soon apparent, and appeared to promise the cardinal a speedy triumph over his enemies. Arran the governor, in whose vacillating character there was a strong love of popularity, became alienated from the English party ; he declared openly that he Avould sooner abide the extremity of war than consent to the demands of Henry; and, equally irre solute in his religion as in his politics, dismissed Friar Williams and John Rough, his two Protestant chap lains, whom, till then, he had retained in his family.1 The people, also, were now so universally opposed to the renunciation of the amity with France, that Glencairn and Cassillis did not hesitate to inform the English ambassador, they would sooner die than agree to this condition. Such, indeed, was the exacerbation of national feeling upon the subject, that Sadler could not venture abroad without being exposed to insult; whilst the peers Avho were in the interest of Henry complained to the ambassador, that their devotion to England rendered them the objects of universal hatred and contempt.2 To counteract, if possible, this state of things, which seemed to threaten the total wreck of his favourite schemes, Henry was prevailed upon by Sir George Douglas, who privately visited him in England, to relax in the rigour of his demands. By his advice, the im mediate delivery of the infant queen, the surrender of the fortresses, and the resignation of the government into the hands of the English sovereign, were aban- 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 158. 2 Ibid. p. 165."], [299, "MARY 1543 293 doned as hopeless and extravagant conditions, the mention of which had already materially injured his cause ; and the artful envoy returned to Scotland with proposals for the conclusion of the peace and marriage upon a more equitable basis.1 He was instructed, also, to flatter the vanity of the governor, by reneAving, on the part of Henry, his former proposal of a marriage between the Princess Elizabeth and Arran's eldest son ; and so successfully did he labour, that, in a con vention of the nobility held in April, Avhich, hoAvever, was principally composed of those peers and their adherents who were in the interest of England, it Avas resolved to despatch Sir George Douglas and the Earl of Glencairn, as assistants to the ambassadors already there, in the negotiation of the treaty of marriage and alliance, Avhich had been so abruptly broken off by the violence and arrogance of Henry. In the meantime, the opposite party were not idle, and the talents of the cardinal were exerted against the faction of Henry with formidable success. Lennox, Avho till this time had wavered, Avent over to Beaton ; and being admitted to an audieuce by the governor, delivered a flattering message from the French king, containing expressions of the warmest friendship, pro mising immediate assistance in troops and money, should England attempt an invasion, and declaring his resolution to preserve the ancient league between the two kingdoms, as the firmest basis of their mutual prosperity.2 This proposal Arran, for the present, 1 In the State-paper Office are preserved two original documents, containing the instructions given to Sir George Douglas.

They entered into a negotiation with France, in which it was agreed that a force of two thousand men, under the command of Montgomerie Sieur de Lorges, an officer of high military reputation, should be sent to Scotland; they encouraged their friends and adherents, by the hopes of powerful sub sidies, to assemble their forces, garrison their castles, and keep themselves in readiness for the impending struggle ; wdiilst Grimani, the papal legate, Avith the still formidable weapons of ecclesiastical anathemas and processes of excommunication, was invited to ac celerate his journey into Scotland. A convention of the clergy at the same time assembled at St Andrews, in which the probability of a war with England was discussed, and a resolution carried to ascertain and levy, without delay, the sum required in such an exi gency. The assembly was pervaded with the utmost unanimity and enthusiasm : the cause which they were called upon to support was represented as not only that of the church, but of their ancient freedom and na tional independence ; the hearts of the people, and the patriotic feelings of the great majority of the nobility, responded to the sentiments which were uttered ; and the clergy declared their readiness, not only to sacrifice their Avhole private fortunes, but to melt down the church plate, and, were it necessary, themselves fight in the quarrel.1 In the midst of all this opposition, the diplomatic talents of Sir George Douglas were unremittingly exerted to overcome the complicated difficulties which stood in the way of a general conciliation ; and having returned from England with the ultimate resolutions 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 204."], [301, "1543 MARY, 295 of Henry, they were agreed to by the governor and a majority of the nobility, in a convention held at Edinburgh in the beginning of June.1 Satisfied with this approval, although the absence of the cardinal and many of the most influential peers might have assured him that it Avould afterwards be questioned, he returned with expedition to England, and, along with the Earl of Gleucairn and the Scottish ambassadors, Learmont, Hamilton, and Balnaves, met the commis sioners of the sister country at Greenwich, where the treaties of pacification and marriage were finally arranged on the 1st of July.2 The terms were cer tainly far more favourable than those which had been at first proposed by the English monarch. It was agreed that a marriage should take place between the Prince of Wales and Mary queen of Scots, as soon as that princess had reached majority, and that an inviolable peace should subsist between the kingdoms during the lives of these tAvo royal persons, which Avas to continue for a year after the death of the first who should pay the debt of nature. Till she had completed her tenth year, the young Mary was to remain in Scotland under the care of the guardians appointed by the parliament ; Henry being permitted to send thither an English nobleman, with his Avife and atten dants, to form part of the household of the princess. Within a month after she entered her eleventh year, the estates of Scotland solemnly promised to deliver their princess at Berwick to the commissioners appointed to receive her ; and as hostages for the fulfilment of this condition, two earls and four barons wTere to be sent forthwith to England. It was carefully provided that, even if the queen should have issue by the prince, 1 Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. pp. 212, 213. a Rymer, Foedera, vol. xiv. p. 786-791."], [302, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1543. 296 the kingdom of Scotland should retain its name, and be governed by its ancient laws. It had been earnestly desired that the treaty should include a positive abro gation of the long established league between France and Scotland ; but instead of being \" friends to friends and enemies to enemies,\" the utmost that could be procured was the insertion of a clause, by Avhich it was agreed, that neither should afford assistance to any foreign aggressor, notwithstanding any former stipulation upon this subject. It is apparent that, in this treaty, Henry abandoned the most obnoxious part of his demands ; and had the English monarch, and the Scottish nobles who Avere in his interest, acted with good faith, little ground of objection to the proposed marriage and pacification could have been left to their opponents. But whilst such were all the articles which openly appeared, a private transaction, or \" secret device,\" as it is termed in the original papers which now, for the first time, reveal its existence, was entered into between Henry and his partisans, Maxwell, Glencairn, Angus, and the rest, which AAras at once of a very unjustifiable descrip tion, and calculated to exasperate their adversaries in a high degree. An agreement appears to have been drawn up by the English commissioners, for the sig nature of the Scottish peers and barons taken at the Solway, by which they once more tied themselves to his service ; and, forgetting their allegiance to their natural prince, promised, in the event of any commo tion in Scotland, to adhere solely to the interest of the English monarch, \" so that he should attain all the things then pacted and covenanted, or, at the least, the dominion on this side the Firth.\"1 In the 1 The proof of this transaction is to be found in a paper preserved in the State-paper Office, and dated July 1, 1543, entitled, \" Copy of"], [303, "MARY 1543 297 same treaty the precise sums of ransom to be exacted from the Scottish prisoners taken at the Sobvay were fixed by the commissioners; but before they were permitted to avail themselves of this means for the recovery of their liberty, it appears to have been a condition, that they should sign this agreement which has been above described. In the meantime, the negotiations having been concluded, peace was soon aftenvards proclaimed between the two countries, and the ambassadors returned to Edinburgh Avith the hope that the treaties Avould immediately be ratified by the governor and the parliament. To their mortification, however, they discovered that, in the interval of their absence, Beaton, who had in all probability obtained information of this second combination of Henry and his Scottish prison ers against the independence of the country, had succeeded in consolidating a formidable opposition. The English monarch had at this moment resoh^ed on a war with France ; and any delay in the proposed alliance with Scotland inflamed the haughty impa tience of his temper. His resentment against the cardinal, with whose practices Sadler his ambassador did not fail to acquaint him, now rose to a high pitch, and he repeatedly urged the governor and his parti- the Secret Devise.\" It contains this passage: \u2014 \" Fourthly, if ther happen any division or trouble to arise in Scotland, by practice of the cardinal, kyrkmen, France, or otherwise, I shall sticke and adhere only to the king's majesty's service, as his highness inaye assuredly atteyne these things noe pacted and covenanted, or, at the least, the domynion on this side the Freythe.\" This explains an obscure passage in Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. p. 237, \" The said Earl of Angus hath subscribed the articles of the devise which your majesty sent unto me with your last letters, and the Lord Maxwell telleth me, that, as soon as he received the like articles from your majesty, by his son, he forthwith subscribed the same.

Such, how ever, Avere the vigilance and ability of this energetic ecclesiastic, that he not only escaped the snares, but for a Avhile defeated the utmost efforts of his enemies; and many of the nobles, becoming aware of the plots Avhich were in agitation for the subjugation of Scot land, eagerly joined his party, and prepared by arms to assert their freedom. With this object the car dinal and the Earl of Huntley concentrated their forces in the north, Argyle and Lennox in the west, Avhilst Bothwell, Home, and the Laird of Buccleuch, mustered their feudal array upon the borders.1 They declared that they were compelled to adopt these measures for the protection of the faith and holy church, and the defence of the independence of the realm, which had been sold to Henry by Arran, whom they stigmatized as a heretic and an Englishman.2 So far as it concerned the preservation of what they believed the only true faith, their opposition was defeated ; whilst the great cause of the Reformation, gaining ground by sIoav degrees, was destined to be ultimately triumphant. But it is not to be denied that their accusations regarding the sacrifice of the liberty of the country by its Aveak governor, Avere founded in justice. We know from the high authority of Sadler the English ambassador, that Arran boasted of his English descent ; that he eagerly received the money sent him by Henry, and professed his anxiety for the accomplishment of all his desires. Nor was this all : he entertained, though he did not accept, a proposal of the English monarch to make him King of Scotland beyond the Firth ; and he proposed that, in the event of the cardinal becoming too powerful 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 236. 2 Ibid. pp. 233, 234."], [305, "MARY 1543 299 for him, an army should be sent to invade the country, with Avhich he and his friends might effectually co operate, alleging that, by this means, although for saken by their countrymen, he doubted not that the Avhole realm might be forcibly reduced under the sub jection of England.1 It is not matter pf surprise, therefore, that Beaton, as soon as he became aware of this disposition, of the urgent desire of Henry for the seizure of his person, and of the still more dangerous intrigues of the Scottish prisoners for the subjugation of the realm, should have exerted every effort to defeat their intentions. So bitter and indignant, indeed, were his feelings, that, if we may believe an extraordinary story which is fouud in a letter of the Duke of Suffolk to Sir R. Sadler, the cardinal had challenged Sir Ralph Eure, warden of the marches, to a personal combat, on some ground of quarrel which does not appear. The chal lenge was communicated to Henry, who, considering it in a serious light, intimated his wishes that Eure should fight Avith Beaton in Edinburgh. The whole matter evinces the credulity of the English ambas sador and his royal master, for we cannot believe that the prelate could have contemplated so disgraceful an adventure ; and the conjecture of Suffolk, that it originated in the insolence of a moss-trooper, whom he characterizes as one of the strongest border thieves in Scotland, is probably not far from the truth.2 1 Sadler, vol. i. pp. 216, 253, 256. 3 Letter in State-paper Office, Duke of Suffolk and the Bishop of Durham to Sir Ralph Sadler, July 15, 1543 : \u2014 \"For we cannot thinke the cardinal wolde be so madde as to provoke and challenge any man that wolde fighte with him in the quarrell, or that he intends to fight, onelesse he shall thinke himselfe to be farre the stronger partie, and yet then we thinke he wolde stande alouff and look on rather than to come himselfe among knocks.

To obtain possession of her person was now the first object of the cardinal's party ; and whether by the connivance^)f her immediate guardians, or from some relaxation .in the vigilance of Arran, they at last succeeded.

These devices began soon to produce the desired effect ; and this was accelerated by one of those rash measures into which Henry Avas so frequently hurried by the impetuosity of his temper. Soon after the pro clamation of peace, the Scottish merchants, Avho then carried on a lucrative foreign commerce, had despatched a fleet of merchantmen, Avhich sought shelter from a storm in an English port.

His friends, Angus, Cassillis, andGlencairn, with other barons attached to England, proposed to assemble their forces, and prepare for immediate war ; the time, they basely declared, Avas come, when Henry must send a main army into Scotland, Avith which they might co-operate in his conquest of the realm ;2 and such was the exasperation of the two factions, that, in the opinion of the English ambassador, a hostile col- lision was impossible to be avoided. It was averted, however, by a revolution as sudden as it was extra- ordinary. On the 28th of August, the governor, in an interview with Sir Ralph Sadler, expressed an entire devotedness to Henry, declaring that no prince alive should have his heart and service, but the English monarch. On the 3d of September, before a week had elapsed, he met the cardinal at Callander house, the seat of Lord Livingston ; all causes of animosity were removed, and a complete reconciliation with the prelate took place.

Such was the conclusion of this remarkable coalition : its causes are of more difficult discovery ; but are probably to be traced to the secret influence of the Abbot of Paisley, bastard brother of Arran, and a zealous adherent of the cardinal, who had lately arrived from France. This able ecclesiastic is said to have secretly persuaded the governor, that, by his friendship with England, and his renunciation of the papal supremacy, he was under mining his own title to the government and to his paternal estates, which rested on a divorce, dependent for its validity on the maintenance of the authority of the Holy See. Arran, at no time distinguished by much penetration or resolution, took the alarm, and, believing it his only security, consented to a union with Beaton, whom he never aftenvards deserted. 2 Encouraged by this success, the cardinal and the governor earnestly laboured to bring over to their party the Earl of Angus and his associates. They entreated them to attend the approaching coronation of the young queen ; to assist, by their presence and experience, in the parliament, and thus to restore unity to the commonwealth : but this proud and selfish potentate and his confederates only replied by sullenly retiring to Douglas castle, where they assembled their 1 MS.

In the meantime, the ceremony of the coro nation took place at Stirling, a new council Avas appointed, the governor took an oath that he would administer the affairs of the kingdom by their advice ; and it was resolved that a convention should be shortly held at Edinburgh, in which all disputes Avith England, relative to the non-performance of the treaties, might be calmly discussed, and, if possible, equitably adjusted. From the temper, however, in which Henry received the intelligence of this great change in Scotland, little calmness on his side could be expected. In a paroxysm of indignation he despatched a herald into that country, denouncing war if the treaties were not immediately fulfilled.2 He addressed a letter to the magistrates of Edinburgh, threatening them with severe retribution, should they permit the populace to offer violence to his ambassador ; he commanded his warden, Sir Thomas Wharton, to liberate the chiefs of the Armstrongs, who were then his prisoners, on condition of their directing the fury of their border war against the estates of those Scottish lords who opposed him ; and he determined on the invasion of Scotland with an overwhelming force, as soon as he could muster his poAver, and make arrangements for its subsistence.3 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 288. 2 Credence of the English herald sent into Scotland.

To Lennox had hitherto been committed the negotiations with France, aud in consequence of his advice, a French ambas sador, the Sieur de la Brosse, was despatched to Scotland, accompanied by a small fleet, bearing mili tary stores, fifty pieces of artillery, and ten thousand crowns,2 to be distributed amongst the friends of the cardinal.

Another object of the patriarch was, to advise the renewal of the league with France ; nor could any measure be more agreeable to the body of the people. They were aAvare of the determination of Henry to invade and attempt the conquest of the country; they were incensed to the highest degree by the detention of their ships ; the rekindling of the war upon the borders had recalled all their martial propensities ; and Sadler, soon after the arrival of the French fleet, informed his royal master, that such had been the effect of the promises and pensions of the ambassador, who had been received with great distinction at court, that the Avhole realm was entirely in the French in terest. According to the representations of this able minister, the people of Scotland could not conceal from themselves that France required nothing but friendship, and had sometimes assisted them at their utmost need, in their efforts to maintain the honour and liberty of the country; Avhilst England sought to bring them into subjection, and asserted a superiority which, he added, from their heart they so universally detested and abhorred, that unless by open force it was vain to look for their consent.1 To this last fatal appeal matters appeared to be now rapidly approaching.

His wisest councillors, however, dissuaded him from immediate invasion ; to the cardinal and the governor, some time was also required for the assembling of their forces ; and thus an interval of brief and insincere negotiation preceded the breaking out of hostilities. It was at this time that Sadler the ambassador was instructed to propose to the Scottish merchants, whose ships had been unjustly detained, the restitution of their property, under the condition that they would assist the English monarch in the execution of his projects against the independence of their country. These brave and honest men, however, spurned at the proposal, with which they declared themselves greatly offended ; affirming, that they would not only lose their goods and ships without farther suit or petition, but would willingly forfeit their lives rather than agree to a condition which would make them traitors to their native land : a memorable contrast to the late conduct of the nobility, and a proof that the spirit of national independence, which in Scotland had long been a stranger to many of the proudest in the aris tocracy, still resided in healthy vigour in the untainted bosoms of the commons.1 Where such principles animated the body of the people, it was no easy matter for Henry to succeed ; and the exasperation of the nation was increased by 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 324."], [314, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1543. 308 the seizure of the Lords Somerville and Maxwell, the principal agents of Angus in conducting his intrigues Avith England.

MaxAvell and Somerville were imprisoned; the governor and the cardinal determined to assemble a parliament early in December ; and, as the inter cepted packet contained ample evidence of treason, it was agreed that its first business should be the im peachment and forfeiture of Angus and his adherents. Alarmed at such a design, these barons assembled their forces, with the idea that they would be strong enough to bring about a reATolution before the meeting of the estates ; but in this they were disappointed. The governor, acting by the advice of Beaton, at once resolved on war, seized Dalkeith and Pinkie, two of the chief houses of the Douglases, and sent a herald to Tantallon, where Sadler had taken refuge, com manding Angus to dismiss from his castle one whom they could no longer regard as the ambassador of Eng land, considering his false practices with the nobility in this time of Avar.1 Meanwhile the parliament assembled, to which the full attendance of the three estates, the presence of the papal legate, and the grave and Aveighty subjects to be debated, gave unusual solemnity.

A summons of treason was prepared against the Earl of Angus, and those of his party Avho had signed the bond in Douglas castle ; and the treaties of peace and marriage lately concluded with Henry the Eighth, were declared at an end, in consequence of the unjust conduct of the English mo narch in seizing the Scottish ships,1 and refusing to ratify the peace, although it had been confirmed by the oath and seal of the regent of the kingdom. The \u00a9 \u00a9 French ambassadors, De la Brosse and Mesnaige, were then introduced, and delivered the message of their royal master : they represented Francis as anxious for the renewal of the alliance between the two countries, and declared he had empowered them to tender his immediate assistance in the defence of the liberty of the realm and its youthful queen, against the unAvar ranted designs of England. This offer Avas enthusias tically accepted : the cardinal and a select council were directed to revise and renew the treaties which had so long united the realms of France and Scotland ; Secre tary Panter, and Campbell of Lundy, proceeded on a mission to the French court ; and a kinsman of the regent was despatched to solicit the assistance of Den mark.

By such methods the seeds of reformation were very generally disseminated through out the country. Sixteen years had now elapsed since the cruel burning of Hamilton ; but the courage with which Russel and Kennedy had defended their prin ciples at the stake, was still fresh in the recollection of the people ; and although inimical to the designs of Glencairn, Somerville, MaxAvell, and the Protestant lords, for the subjection of the country under the dominion of England, they were disposed to listen with a favourable ear to their denunciations of the corruptions of the church. Arran, however, in renouncing the ties which had bound him to Henry, had, as we have seen, at the same time abjured his former convictions, and being again received into the bosom of the church, was in duced by Beaton to renew the persecution of the re formers. In the parliament which annulled the treaties with England, an act was passed, declaring 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 854."], [317, "1543-4, MARY, 311 that complaints were daily made to the governor against the heretics, who began more and more to multiply in the realm, disseminating opinions contrary to the true faith ; and all prelates were enjoined to make inquisition within their dioceses for such persons, and to proceed against them according to the laws of holy church. The expectation, however, of an immediate invasion by England protracted, for a short season, the execution of this cruel decree ; and the dissensions which followed between the governor and the Douglases, the leaders of the English or Protestant party, gave a breathing time to the sincere disciples of the Reformation. Into any minute detail of those intrigues Avhich occupied the interval between the meeting of parlia ment and the commencement of the war, it would be tedious to enter. The picture which they present of the meanness and dishonesty of the English party, who have reaped in the pages of some of our historians so high a meed of praise, as the advocates of the Protestant doctrines, is very striking. To escape the sentence of forfeiture to which their repeated treasons had exposed them, the Earls of Lennox, Angus, Cas sillis, and Glencairn, who had lately bound themselves by a written covenant to the service of the King of England, did not hesitate to transmit to Arran a similar bond or agreement, conceived in equally solemn terms, by which they stipulated, for \" themselves and all others their complices aud partakers, to remain true, faithful, and obedient servants to their sovereign lady and her authority; to assist the lord governor for defence of the realm against their old enemies of Eng land ; to support the liberties of holy church ; and to maintain the true Christian faith.\"1 To this treaty 1 Agreements (January 13 and 14, 1543-4) entered into by the"], [318, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 312 1543-4. with the gOA'ernor, Angus gave in his adherence on the 13th of January, and to their faithful perfor mance of its conditions, his brother, Sir George Douglas, and Glencairn's eldest son, the Master of Kilmaurs, surrendered themselves as pledges ; yet two months did not expire before we find Angus once more addressing a letter to Henry, assuring him of his in violable fidelity; whilst, at the same time, the nobles who had so lately bound themselves to Arran and the cardinal, despatched a messenger to court, with an earnest request that the English monarch would accelerate his preparations for the invasion of the country, transmitting minute instructions regarding the conduct of the enterprise.1 A main army, they advised, should proceed by land ; a strong fleet, Avith an additional force on board, was to be despatched by sea ; whilst it would be of service, it was observed, to send ten or tAvelve ships to the west sea, to produce a diversion in the Earl of Argyle's country, \u2014 an advice in which we may probably detect the selfish policy of Glencairn, his rival and personal enemy. A stratagem of the same kind had already been attended with suc cess, when, at the suggestion of the same baron, the Highland chiefs shut up in the castles of Edinburgh and Dunbar were let loose by the governor Arran, under the condition that they would direct their fury against the country of Argyle.2 Henry with much earnestness was urged to attempt this before the ex pected aid could arrive from France ; and we shall Earls of Cassillis, Angus, Lennox, and Glencairn, with the Earl of Arran governor of Scotland.

She entreated, as a last request, to be alloAved to die with her husband ; but this was denied : and, according to a savage distinction in the executions of these times, she was condemned to be droAvned. \" It matters not, dear partner,\" said she ; \" Ave have lived together many happy days, but this ought to be the most joyful of them all, when we are about to have joy for ever; therefore I will not bid you good-night, for ere the night shall close we shall be united in the kingdom of heaATen.\" She then gave the little infant, who still hung upon her breast, to the attendants, held out her hands to be bound by the executioners, saw without any change of countenance her feet secured in the same manner, and Avas cast into a deep pool of water, where her sufferings Avere ended in a moment. Such atrocious and short-sighted cruelty only strengthened the convictions which they were intended to extin guish.1 Henry was now busy with the organisation of his projected invasion. It was the advice of the Earl of Hertford that the army should first make themselves masters of Leith, and fortifying that sea-port, proceed to ravage the country and burn the capital, whilst the fleet kept possession of the Forth, and co-operated in the destruction of the coast and shipping ; but, fortu nately for the Scots, a more rapid, though less fatal, mode of operations was chosen by the privy council.2 In the interval of preparation, the monarch, whose 1 Spottiswood's History, p. 75. 2 See Illustrations, letter D."], [321, "1544, MARY 315 passions were now excited to the utmost pitch against the cardinal, to whom he justly ascribed the total failure of his schemes, lent himself to a conspiracy, the object of which was the apprehension or assassina tion of his powerful enemy. The history of this plot presents an extraordinary picture of the times, and demands more than common attention. On the 17th of April, Crichton laird of Brunston,1 who, since the coalition between Beaton and the governor, had been employed by Sadler the ambassador as a spy upon their movements, despatched to the Earl of Hertford, then at Newcastle, a Scottish gentleman named Wishart, who communicated to Hertford the parti culars of the intended plot. He stated that Kirkaldy the laird of Grange, the Master of Rothes, eldest son to the earl of that name, and John Charteris, were willing to apprehend or slay the cardinal, if assured of proper support from England. Wishart, who brought this offer, was instantly despatched by post to the English court, and in a personal interview with the king, informed him of the services which Kirkaldy and Rothes were ready to perform. Henry received the letters of Brunston, and listened to the report of his messenger with much satisfaction, ap proved of the plot, and, in the event of its being successful, promised the conspirators his royal protec tion, should they be constrained to take refuge in his dominions.2 But Beaton had either received secret information of the project for his destruction, or the 1 The house of Brunston was situated on the Esk, near Mussel burgh. 2 Letter, orig.

Succeeding events, however, demonstrated that it was delayed only, not aban doned, and that the same unscrupulous agents who now intrigued with the English monarch were at last induced by Henry to accomplish their atrocious purpose. It was now the end of April, and having concen trated his naval and military power, the English king at last let loose his vengeance on the devoted country. On the 1st of May, a fleet of two hundred sail, under the command of Lord Lisle, high-admiral of England, appeared in the Firth ; and the citizens, after anxiously gazing for a short time at the unusual spectacle, on a nearer inspection found their worst fears realized, by discovering the royal flag of England streaming from the mast head of the admiral. For such a surprisal it seems extraordinary that the governor was unpre pared, although Henry's intentions must have been well known. A very inferior force might have suc cessfully attacked the English in their disembarkation, but the opportunity was lost ; four days were allowed Hertford, who landed his army and his artillery at his leisure ; and it Avas not till he wras advancing from Granton craig to Leith, that Arran and the cardinal, at the head of a force hastily levied, and consisting chiefly of their personal adherents, threw themselves between the enemy and this place, as if they meant to dispute the passage. They were immediately repulsed, how ever, by the superior force of Hertford, and Leith was given up to the plunder of the army without a struggle. Although deserted by the governor, the inhabitants of Edinburgh flew to arms, and, mustering under the command of Otterburn of Reidhall, the provost of the city, barricaded the gates, and determined to defend"], [323, "1544, MARY 317 themselves. Otterburn, however, was first despatched to the English camp, and, in an interview with Hert ford, remonstrated against such unlooked-for hostilities, and proposed an amicable adjustment of all differences. It was ansAvered by the English earl, that he came as a soldier, not an ambassador; that his commission com manded him to ravage the country with fire and sword ; nor could he withdraw his army under any other con dition than the delivery of the young queen into the hands of his master. Such a message was received with much indignation by the citizens. They declared they would rather submit to the last extremities than purchase safety by so ignominious a course, and pre pared to sustain the onset of the enemy, when they were deserted by their chief magistrate, who either dreaded so unequal a contest, or had been brought over to the English party.1 Upon this they retreated into the city, chose a new provost, completed their temporary ramparts, and for a Avhile not only sustained the assault of Hertford, but ultimately compelled him to retire to Leith, for the purpose of bringing up his battering ordnance. But a contest so unequal could not last. Arran, Huntley, Argyle, and the cardinal, had retreated to Linlithgow ; and to have attempted to defend the gates against the heavy ordnance, without hopes of assistance, would have been folly. During the night, therefore, the citizens, removing Avith them all their transportable Avealth, silently abandoned the town ; but Hamilton of Stenhouse resolutely defended the castle ; and Hertford, after an unaA'ailing attempt to construct a battery, which was dismounted by the superior fire of the garrison, was compelled to raise the 1 Diurnal of Occunrents, p. 31.

Its conflagration lasted for three days ; and the English army, having been reiuforced by four thou sand border horse under Lord Eure, employed them selves in ravaging and plundering the adjacent country with an unsparing cruelty, which they knew would be acceptable to their master the king, and which was not soon forgotten by the inhabitants. It was now the 15th of May, and the governor having assembled an army, and liberated the Earl of Angus and his brother George Douglas, in the hope that all party differences might be forgotten1 in a determination to repel the common enemy, was rapidly advancing to give them battle, when Lord Lisle, setting fire to Leith, reimbarked a portion of the army, and instantly set sail, leaving the remainder of the host to return by land under Hertford. Before weighing anchor, the English admiral seized two large Scottish ships, the Salamander and the Unicorn, and destroyed by fire all the smaller craft which lay in the harbour ; nor did he omit to plunder of its maritime wealth every creek or harbour w7hich lay within reach, as he sailed along the coast. The land army was equally remorse less in its retreat. Seton, Haddington, Dunbar, and Renton, were successively given to the flames ; and thus ended an expedition as cruel as it was impolitic, which only increased in the Scots the virulence of the national antipathy, and rendered more distant any prospect of a cordial union between the tAvo kingdoms. Henry, as it is Avell observed by Lord Herbert, had done too much for a suitor, and too little for a conqueror. 1 So innate was George Douglas's disposition to intrigue, that soon after his liberation, he had a private interview in Leith with the Earl of Hertford, and gave him advice concerning the conduct of the ex pedition.

The effects of this short-sighted policy Avere soon seen in the splitting of that Anglo-Scottish party which had so long supported the interests of the English mo narch. Angus, George Douglas, and their numerous and powerful adherents, joined the cardinal, and the only friends left to England were the Earls of Lennox and Glencairn ; the first a small acquisition, a man of weak, selfish, and versatile character; but the other one of the ablest and most powerful barons in Scotland, Avhose son, the Master of Kilmaurs, from his spirit and military experience, was well fitted to execute the plans which the judgment of the father had matured. Such, indeed, was the great power and influence of Glencairn in the west of Scotland, that, in the event of a former invasion, contemplated by Henry in 1543, he undertook to convey his army from Carlisle to Glasgow, without stroke or challenge ; 1 and so faithful had he remained to these principles, that only a few days after the retreat of Hertford, we find him engaged in a negotia tion which, considering the cruel ravages then inflicted by the English army, reflects little credit on his love of country. On the 17th of May, at Carlisle, an agree ment was concluded between Glencairn, Lennox, and Henry the Eighth, by Avhich that monarch consented to settle an ample pension on the former, and his son the Master of Kilmaurs; whilst to Lennox a more splendid reward Avas promised, in the government of Scotland and the hand of Lady Margaret Douglas, his niece. Upon their side, the Scottish barons 1 Sadler, vol. i. p. 156."], [326, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 320 1544. acknowledged Henry as Protector of the realm of Scot land, a title which, considering his late invasion, almost sounds ironical ; and they engaged to use their utmost efforts to become masters of the person of the young queen, and deliver her into his hands, along with the principal fortresses in the country. Lennox agreed to the surrender of Dunbarton, with the isle and castle of Bute. In conclusion, both earls stipulated that they would serve the English monarch against France, and all nations and persons, for such wages as his other subjects, no reservation being added of their allegiance to their natural prince, which, by the treaty, they virtually renounced.1 In this base agreement, one redeeming article was included, by which Glencairn and Lennox undertook to cause the word of God to be truly taught in their territories : the Bible is de scribed by them as the only foundation from which all truth and honour proceedeth ; but it appears not to have suggested itself to these Scottish barons, that the seizure of their lawful sovereign, and the betrayal of the liberty of their country, were scarcely reconcileable with the sacred standard to which they appealed. From Carlisle, where he had concluded the negotia tion, Glencairn hurried to his own country to assemble his vassals, whilst Lennox collected his strength at Dunbarton ; but, as if to punish their desertion of their country, every thing went against them. Arran, whose measures, hoav directed by the cardinal, were marked by unusual promptitude, lost not a moment in marching against them at the head of a thousand men, and advancing to Glasgow, was boldly confronted by Glencairn, with five hundred spearmen, on a wide common beside the city.

Glencairn fled almost alone to Dunbarton, and Lennox, having delivered the castle into his hands, instantly took ship for England, where he was soon after united to the Lady Margaret Douglas. His favourable reception at the English court, and his unnatural conduct to his country, were fatal to his illustrious brother, the Lord Aubigny, in France, whom Francis the First, suspect ing his fidelity, apparently on no good grounds, deprived of his high offices, and threw into prison. Henry's affairs in Scotland, so far as they depended on the faction which had hitherto supported him, appeared at this crisis to be desperate ; and a general council being summoned to meet at Stirling on the 3d of June,2 it was attended by the whole body of the nobility, Avith the exception of Lennox and Glencairn. A favourable opportunity was hoav afforded for the union of all parties in support of the independence of the realm. The insincerity of Henry's professions Avas demonstrated by the cruel ravages with Avhich his late invasion had been accompanied ; a feeling of deep indignation had arisen in the breasts of many of his former adherents ; and all classes recoiled from a union which they were called upon to celebrate amid the flames of their capital, and the murder of its citizens. But it Avas the misfortune of the Scottish aristoci'acy, 1 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 32. VOL. IV. 2 Ibid. X"], [328, "322 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1544. that when immediate danger Avas past, it was perpetu ally disunited by the spirit of selfishness and ambition. Of the nobles, a large majority had become disgusted with the weakness and vacillation of the government of Arran ; and they noAV proposed that the regency should be conferred on the queen-mother, from whose energy they anticipated a happier result, and more determined measures against England.1 It is probable that the Earl of Angus and his brother were chiefly implicated in this new movement, which is unknown to our general historians, and involved in much obscu rity. It is certain, however, that a coalition took place between the Catholic and Protestant parties ; that in a convention they declared the governor deprived of his authority, proclaimed the queen-dowager regent in his stead, appointed a new privy council, and conferred upon the Earl of Angus the office of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. This state of things could not long continue, and only brought increasing troubles to the country, which continued to be distracted by intestine dissensions and foreign war. Arran, still supported by the cardinal and a small party of the nobility, persevered in exer cising his authority as governor, and the queen-dowager began to dread that all her endeavours would prove insufficient to keep her partisans together.

MARY 323 Argyle was required to repress a rebellion of the clans, encouraged, in all probability, by the intrigues of Eng land, which frequently adopted this policy to weaken her enemy. The disturbance was speedily repressed, yet not without much bloodshed, being mixed up with those private feuds which prevailed in these savage districts. In a ferocious contest at Inverlochy, between the Frasers, led by the Lord Lovat and his son, with a more numerous body of the Macdonalds, the com batants, stripping to their shirts on account of the extreme heat of the weather, fought rather for exter mination than victory ; two survivors being left on one side, and four on the other.1 During these sanguinary contests in the remote Highlands, an equally disgrace ful spectacle was exhibited at Perth, where a claim for the office of provost was decided by arms, between Lord Ruthven on the one side, supported by a numerous train of his vassals, and Lord Gray, with Norman Lesley master of Rothes, and Charteris of Kinfauns, on the other. During his late ecclesiastical progress to Perth, the cardinal, who suspected Ruthven of leaning to the reformed opinions, had deprived him of his office of provost, and directed the citizens to elect Charteris : a crafty device, as was believed, to sow dissension between his rivals in power, it being noto rious that the Lords Gray and Ruthven, with the Earl of Rothes and his adherents, had been hitherto unanimous in their opposition to Beaton. Nor was he unsuccessful : Ruthven, supported by the toAvnsmen and merchants, in those days trained to arms, resented the affront, and held his place by force, whilst Char teris, reinforced by Gray, Glammis, and Norman Lesley, broke into the town ; and both parties meeting 1 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 34."], [330, "324 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1544. on the narroAV bridge over the Tay, fought with san guinary obstinacy till the victory declared for Ruth ven ; sixty of his opponents being left dead on the pavement, and the rest compelled to fly from the city.1 It was now time for the Earl of Lennox to perform his engagements to Henry ; and having sailed from Bristol with a squadron of ten ships and a small force of hagbutteers, archers, and pikemen, he arrived on the coast of Scotland, attacked and plundered the isle of Arran, and, sailing to Bute, occupied the island, and its castle of Rothesay, with little difficulty. These acquisitions, according to agreement, were delivered to Sir Rise Mansell and Richard Broke, Avho accompanied the expedition, and took formal possession of them in behalf of the King of England.2 He next directed his course to Dunbarton castle, a fortress of which, as the key of the west of Scotland, Henry had long, but in vain, sought the possession. It Avas the pro perty of Lennox, and being commanded by Stirling of Glorat, one of his retainers, to whom he had in trusted it on his departure for England, he did not doubt for a moment that it Avould be surrendered. In this, however, he was disappointed : Stirling received and recognized him as his master, but the brave baron did not forget his higher allegiance to his sovereign. The first mention of his giving up the castle to Henry was received Avith a burst of generous indignation ; the garrison, taking the alarm, rose in arms ; and Lennox, with his English friends, becoming alarmed for their 1 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 34. 3 Instructions to Sir Rise Mansell, and Richard Broke.

In the meantime, the Earl of Argyle, with a consi derable force, had occupied Dunoon, a strong castle situated on the narrow strait between Argyle and Renfrew, whilst George Douglas, Avith four thousand men, had entered Dunbarton. The squadron there fore deemed it prudent to fall down the Clyde ; and being fired on in passing Dunoon, Lennox, in the chivalrous spirit of the times, accepted the defiance, and landing under cover of a fire from his own ships, attacked the Highlanders, Avhom he dispersed Avith considerable slaughter. He next invaded Kentire, plundered the adjacent coasts of Kyle and Carrick, and returning to Bristol, despatched Sir Peter Mewtas to inform King Henry, then at Boulogne, of the termi nation of an expedition which had failed in its principal purpose \u2014 the seizure of Dunbarton; and only rendered more distant the prospect of peace between the coun tries.1 Much indignation was expressed by Lennox and the English ministers against the Earl of Glen cairn, and his son the Master of Kilmaurs, whose services had been so lately purchased, and so soon Avithdrawn. Wriothesley, the chancellor, inveighed agaiust \" the old fox and his cub,\" who had imposed on the simplicity of Lennox ; and although both the father and son had written to excuse their proceedings, their falsehood was considered apparent, and their apology little regarded.2 During the continuance of this expedition, Sir Ralph Eure, Sir Brian Layton, and Sir Richard Bowes, 1 We know from the Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 35, that Lennox arrived at Dunbarton on the 10th of August. 2 State Papers of Henry the Eighth, published by government, p. 769."], [332, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 326 1544. ravaged the Scottish borders with merciless barbarity, and organizing a system of rapine and devastation against those districts where the Scots were most defenceless, reduced the country almost to a desert.1 It could scarcely indeed be otherwise, considering the perseverance of the border inroads, and the distracted state of public affairs produced by the continued dis sensions between the parties of the governor and the queen-dowager. Men neither knew whom to obey, nor where to look for protection. In the beginning of November, the regent held a parliament, in which Angus and his brother were charged with treason, and all the heavy feudal penalties of banishment and for feiture threatened to be enforced against them. On the 13th of the same month, the three estates as sembled at Stirling in obedience to the summons of the queen, who at the same time issued a proclamation discharging all classes of the people from their alle giance to the pretended regent.2 In this state of things the talents of the cardinal were again employed in negotiating an agreement between the rival factions, which, although insincere, had a brief success.

But scarce had they planted their artillery, when their proceedings became again weakened by suspicion and treason. It was discovered that the Douglases continued their correspondence Avith England ; the inferior leaders dreading the result, began to disperse in disorder; the governor became alarmed for his personal safety, and two thousand English defeated and chased off the field a Scottish army more than triple their number. In this dis graceful rout, Angus, who had the conduct of the vanguard, with Glencairn, Cassillis, Lord Somerville, and the Sheriff of Ayr, opposed no resistance to the enemy ; whilst BotliAvell, who brought up the rear, in vain attempted to rally, and was at last compelled to join in the flight.1 The failure of this last expedition was Avholly to be ascribed to the intrigues of the Douglases, Avho, with their associates, Glencairn and Cassillis, were now playing a desperate game. A sentence of treason hung over their heads in Scotland ; in England, Henry regarded their conduct with so much suspicion, that in the late expedition of Hertford, no protection had been granted to their estates and vassals. They Avere now, therefore, in a position as precarious as it Avas discredit able : likely to lose the confidence of both governments ; exposed to the chance of banishment from their own country, and to be cut off* from a retreat into England. Under these circumstances they adopted that middle course which is not uncommon to men long engaged in political intrigue ; and, more studious for the posses- 1 The cannon, however, were carried off, as is asserted, by the exertions of the Douglases.

George Douglas, brother of Angus, a man of great ability, and little scrupulous as to means, continued his correspondence with the English king, and betrayed to him the secrets of the government. Angus, on the other hand, deceived Arran and the queen-doAvager into the belief that they had completely repented of their former tergiversation, and convinced of the injustice of Henry's demands, Avere prepared cordially to co-operate in the defence of the country.1 By this pretended coalition they gained an impor tant end. In a parliament held at Edinburgh in the beginning of December, which was attended by the whole body of the nobility, the earl and his brother Sir George, being personally present, were absolved from the charge of treason, and declared innocent of the crimes which had been alleged against them. Glencairn, Cassillis, and Sir Hugh Campbell sheriff of Ayr, obtained at the same time a remission for all treasons committed by them, in return for the good service done, or to be done to the realm, although it does not clearly appear Avhat services could be meant.2 An attempt was made to raise, by a land tax, a sum of money for the support of a thousand horsemen, to be placed for the defence of the borders under the Earl of Angus, which completely failed. The barons of Lothian declined either to pay the money or to serve under a leader whose honesty they doubted ; and so 1 Our general historians, Buchanan, Lesley, and Maitland, not aware of the double part acted by the Douglases, have represented this coali tion as sincere.

The com mons dreaded a repetition of the flight from Colding ham, aud the barons adopted the expedient of entering into covenants with each other for their mutual defence against the continued inroads of the English.1 O \u00a9 Of all this the effects Avere deplorable. During the contest for the regency, the border barons, Avhose duty it was to defend these districts, remained inactive ; many border clans, at all times somewhat precarious in their allegiance, entered into the service of England, and assumed the red cross as a badge of their deser tion ; others Avere compelled to purchase protection ; whilst the English Avardens insulted over the country, and became so confident in their superiority, that they contemplated its entire conquest, even to the Forth, as a matter of no difficult attainment. With these proud hopes, Sir Ralph Eure, and Sir Brian Layton, repaired to court ; and in an intervieAV Avith the king, explained to him a scheme for this purpose, which, as a means of punishing the alleged perfidy of the Scots, met Avith his entire approAral. As a reward for the uninterrupted success Avith which their various inroads had been attended, Eure obtained, it is said, a royal grant of all the country he should con quer in the Merse, Teviotdale, and Lauderdale, districts of which a great part formed the hereditary property of the Earls of Douglas. The insolence of so premature an appropriation of his paternal estates, incensed Angus far more than the indignity offered to his country ; and 1 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 37."], [336, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 330 1544. he is said to have sworn a great oath, that if Ralph Eure dared to act upon the grant, he would Avrite his sasine, or instrument of possession, on his skin with sharp pens and bloody ink. The English baron, how ever, was not of a temper to be deterred by threats, and soon after repaired to the borders with a force of five thousand men, consisting of foreign mercenaries, English archers, and a body of six hundred border Scots, who wore the red cross above their armour. With these they had recommenced their inroads, in which they even exceeded their former barbarity ; they burnt the Tower of Broomhouse, and in it its lady, a noble and aged matron, with her whole family. They penetrated to Melrose, which they left completely spoiled and in ruins ; not sparing its venerable abbey, the burial place of the Earls of Douglas, whose tombs they ransacked and defaced with wanton sacrilege. Deeply enraged at this neAV insult, Angus collected his vassals, and, joining the governor, advanced to Melrose ; but they were surprised by a sudden attack of the English, and driven from their position with considerable slaughter. The cause of this new disaster is ascribed by an ancient chronicle, apparently a con temporary document, to the secret information furnished to the enemy by George Douglas ; and it is certain that he was then in communication both with Sir Ralph Eure and his royal master ; but the sincerity of his brother the earl upon this occasion is not to be doubted ; he acted in the true spirit of a feudal baron. The love of revenge, the desire to retaliate the insult offered to his house, burned inextinguishably strong in a bosom which, for many years, had been a stranger to the love of his country ; and Douglas, true only to himself, appeared for the moment to be true to Scot land. With these bitter feelings he saAV the English"], [337, "1544, MARY 331 once more plunder Melrose, and commence their re treat to Jedburgh ; whilst he and Arran, with a far inferior force, could only hang upon their rear and watch their motions. On reaching the Teviot, Eure, confident in his superior strength, Avhich was more than five to one, encamped on a level moor or common above the village of Ancram ; whilst the Scots fell back to a neigh bouring eminence, and hesitated Avhether, with so great a disparity, they should risk a battle. At this mo ment they were joined by Norman Lesley master of Rothes, at the head of twelve hundred lances; and soon after, Walter Scott, the veteran Laird of Buc cleuch, came up at full speed, with the neAvs that his followers were within an hour's march.1 It was resolved, with these reinforcements, to give battle to the euemy, who during all this time eagerly Avatched their motions ; but, by the advice of Buccleuch, Arran abandoned the height Avhich he occupied, and drew up in a level plain behind it, named Peniel Heugh, where they were entirely concealed from the English ; they then dismounted, and sent the horses with the camp boys to an eminence beyond the plain. These dis positions were intended to betray the English into the idea that the Scottish army was in flight ; and they succeeded. Rendered careless and confident by their long career of success, and anticipating a repeti tion of the combat at Coldingham, Sir Brian Layton aud Sir Robert Bowes pushed on with the advance ; whilst Sir Ralph Eure followed at full speed Avith the main battle, consisting of a thousand spears, with an equal number of archers and hagbutteers on each wing. The rapidity of their movement necessarily threAV their ranks into some disorder ; the horses were bloAvn by 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 861."], [338, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 332 1544. their gallop up the hill ; the infantry were breathless from eagerness to arrive on the same ground with their companions ; and in this state, having sur mounted the eminence, they discovered, to their astonishment, instead of an enemy in flight, the com pact serried phalanx of the Scots within a short distance of their own army. At this moment a heron, disturbed by the troops, sprung from the adjacent marsh, and soared aAvay over the heads of the combatants. \"Oh!\" said Angus, \"that I had here my Avhite goss-hawk : Ave should then all yoke l at once ! \" To have halted, with the hope of re storing order to their ranks, would have been fatal ; and Eure, relying on his superiority, charged bravely and without delay. But the advantage of infantry over cavalry, of Avhich the main body of the English was composed, never more strikingly evinced itself. The Scottish spears, an ell longer than the English, repulsed the van under Layton and Bowes, and pushed it back in confusion on the main battle, which, in its turn, was throAvn upon the reanvard. All was soon in confusion ; and no efforts of their gallant leaders could prevent an entire rout. The setting sun shone full in the faces of the English ; and their enemy had also the advantage of the wind, Avhich blew the smoke of the harquebusses upon the columns of their adver saries and blinded them. On the first symptoms of flight, the six hundred Scottish borderers Avho were in the service of Henry, throwing away their red crosses, joined their countrymen, and with the merci less spirit common to renegades, made a pitiless slaughter of their former friends.

On the English side the loss was great, eight hundred being slain, and a thousand made prisoners ; but that which afforded most satisfaction to the enemy was the discovery, amongst the dead bodies, of Eure and Layton, the leaders who, for the last six months, had signalized themselves by such unexampled and cruel ravages. Amongst the captives were many knights and gentle men ; and the governor, having first seized the camp equipage which was left in Melrose, advanced to Coldingham, which the enemy evacuated ; he then marched to Jedburgh, and recovered from the English not only the town but the greater part of the borders, which they had lately considered a conquered territory, making proclamation that all who had been compelled to accept assurance from England, and assume the red cross, should, on returning to their allegiance, have a full indemnity. On receiving news of this defeat, Henry expressed deep indignation against Angus, whom he accused of ingratitude, and threatened with the extremity of his resentment. Douglas's ansAver was characteristic; \u2014 \"What!\" said he, \"is our broth er-in-bow offended, because, like a good Scotsman, I have avenged upon Ralph Eure the defaced tombs of my ancestors ? they were better men than he, and I ought to have done no less ; and will he take my life for that ?

By this success confidence was restored to the people, whose hearts had sunk under the unresisted ravages of the English, whilst new strength was given to the party of the governor and the cardinal. It happened also, that, at this moment, they con fidently expected the support of their continental allies. Francis the First, irritated by the late inva sion of Henry, and the loss of Boulogne, was resolved to exert his utmost efforts against England : he had detached the emperor from his alliance with that country, and now made preparations for its invasion by a powerful fleet ; whilst he determined to send an auxiliary force into Scotland to make a diversion in that quarter. Of such resolutions, early advice was sent from France to Arran ; and the English monarch, having become acquainted with these hostile intentions by a secret despatch from George Douglas, began seriously to dread the consequences of raising so many enemies against him, and to be comdnced that his conduct towards Scotland had been inconsistent and impolitic. He was assured by Douglas, that, so far from gaining his object, or promoting the treaties of peace and marriage, the rigorous measures which some reported he intended to use, Avould drive the people to despair.1 These remonstrances produced some effect.

To prevail upon the Earls of Glencairn, Marshal, and the Douglases, who professed never to have left the allegiance to the English king, to reneAV their active efforts in his service, was no difficult task ; and the Earl of Angus, as a proof of his sincerity, resigned his office of lieu tenant under Arran : but the governor and the cardinal were more difficult to manage.

The injuries Avhich he had received Avere little, in comparison with those which he had recently inflicted, and his power of avenging them was at best problematical. The influence, too, of the party of the governor and the cardinal was every day increasing ; certain intelligence of the embarka tion of the auxiliaries had been received from France ; from Denmark they expected a fleet of merchantmen, laden with provisions ; a friendly negotiation had been opened with the emperor ; and neAV importance had been conferred on Beaton by his receiving from Rome the dignity of legate a latere in Scotland.2 All these circumstances gave confidence to the political friends of the cardinal, whilst Henry's late invasion and sub sequent inroads had created distrust and aversion even in many of his former supporters.

Sir George Douglas, however, Avas less timorous, and sent by Forster a message to the Earl of Hertford in very explicit terms : \u2014 \" He willed me,\" says the em^oy, \" to tell my lord-lieutenant, that if the king Avould have the cardinal dead ; if his grace would promise a good reward for the doing thereof, so that the reward were known what it should be, the country being laAvless as it is, he thinketh that that adventure would be proved ; for he saith, the common saying is, the cardinal is tha only occasion of the war, and is smally beloved in Scotland ; and then, if he were dead, by that means how that reward should be paid.\" Such was the simple proposal of Sir George Douglas, for the removal of his arch- 1 The Discourse of Thomas Forster, gentleman, being sent into Scot land by my Lord-lieutenant, to speak to the Earls of Cassillis, Glen cairn, Angus, Marshal, and George Douglas, being returned with the same to Darnton, the 4th July, 1545.

For the moment, therefore, the scheme seemed to be abandoned by the earls, but it was only to be afterwards resumed by Brunston.1 1 In the light which it throws upon the intrigues of the Douglases and the state of parties in Scotland, the report of Forster is a paper of great historical value. It will be published in its entire state in the forthcoming volume of the State Papers ; but an analysis of it, with a few brief extracts, may be interesting to the reader. It thus opens: \u2014 \" The said Thomas Forster sayth, that according to my Lord-lieu tenant's commandment, he entered Scotland at Wark, and so passed to his taker's house in Scotland, as tho he had repayred for his entree to save his lande, and declaring to his taker that he had occasion to speke with George Douglas, his taker was contented, according to the custom e there, that he shuld go at his pleasure ; whereupon he came to Dalkeith to George Douglas, and showed him th' occasion of his hither comyng to speak to him and th' Erll aforesaid, with message from my Lord-lieutenant and Master Sadleyr, who willed him to go to Douglas, where he would cause th' Erlls of Cassillis and Anguisse to mete hym, for he said he could not get them to Dalkeith without gret suspition. And hereupon, he sayth, that going towards Douglas he met th' Erll of Anguisse at Dumfries, where, as he was hunting, he gave him welcome, saying he would give him hawkes and dogges, and caused him to pass the time with him that night ; and on the morrowe brought hym with him to Douglas, and that afternoon sent for th' Erll of Cassillis, who, ryding all night, came thither the next day yerly in the mornyng, whereupon he and th' Erll of Anguisse went into a chamber together, and called the said Forster unto them, who then declared the occasion of his comyng, by whom he was sent, and the full of his instructions. As to the first article, they answered that they were glad he was come, and was welcome to them.\" To the second article, they say they indeed wanted Forster to come ; and in reply to the question, how Henry's godly purpose for the peace and marriage may best be furthered, Cassillis answers that he is still the same true man to Henry as he was at his parting with his majesty. Angus equally promised his cordial assistance, and declared he would either go to the field or stay at home, as Henry judged it best, and would maintain, in the face of all Scotland, that the peace and the marriage were for the good of the realme of Scotland. Forster then desired them to state to him such matters as they had intended to communi-"], [347, "1545 MARY 341 In the midst of these machinations for the removal of his enemies, and preparations for open war, impor tant events had taken place in Scotland. Early in May a French fleet, having on board a body of three thousand infantry and five hundred horse, under the cate by the gentleman that should have met Mr Sadler at Alnwick ; upon which they briefly answered, that \" the effect of that matter was none other than they had already declared ;\" but Cassillis added, \" that such other matters as should be at the convencion he would write it in cypher, and send it to Mr Sadleyr,\" and so departed from them ; and returning again to Dalkeith unto George Douglas, he said he declared to the said George all his conference with the foresaid Erls, requiring him to show him his opinion therein. Douglas promises to do so after the convention. Forster goes on to state, that Douglas went then to the convention, where he tarried seven days. On the return of Dou glas from this convention, Forster asked the news, and what he would do for the king's majesty's advancement and godly affairs? Douglas answers, \" that he will stand to it in all his power,\" the rather that he himself was one of them that \"procured and promised the same, and that ther was never an honest man in Scotland that would be against that promise, for it was the doinge of all the nobles of Scot land, and the governor's part was therein as deep as the rest of them.\" \u2014 Another thing agreed on at the convention was, that \" they would raise an army against the xxviiith of July, and to have them upon Roslin Moor, three miles from Dalkeith, with a month's victuall, and so passing to invade England ; by which tyme he saith the said Lorges Montgomerie hath undertaken on the French king's behalf, that th' army out of France by sea shall be ready to ayde them at their handes, or els at that time should invade in some other place of England. The said George Douglas told him also, that if my Lord-lieutenant thought mete th' arn^y of Scotland were stayed, that then it should be well done to send some ships with diligence with three or four thou sand men to ayde the gentlemen of the Isles, which would stay at home th' Erlls of Huntley and Argyle, and by that meanes he thinks it would stop the rest of th' army from coming forward ; and if it is not so, then to prepare a great power of England to come to the bor ders against that time, which must come very strongly, for all the lords and power of Scotland, as he sayth, will be wholly there, as they have promised : and by reason of th' encouragement of the French men, and the fair largesses that the French king hath promised them by Lorges Montgomerie, they are fully bent to fight as he sayth. But he saith, tho' that he must needs be also there with them, he will do them no good, but will do all that he can to stop them ; and sayth, that if they may be stopped since they have made so gret braggis and avant to Lorges Montgomerie, it wold, as he thinketh, put away all the Commons' hearts from them.\" l 1 The old spelling is not uniformly followed in the copy of this note,"], [348, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 342 1545. command of the Sieur Lorges de Montgomerie, arrived off the Avest coast : but recollecting the device lately practised on their countrymen by the Earl of Lennox, this experienced officer was cautious of committing himself by landing, till informed of the exact state of the country. Being assured, however, that the French politics were still predominant, they disembarked at Dunbarton, and were received wdth much distinction; nor did the enthusiasm diminish when it was found they had brought a considerable sum of money for the emergencies of the war, a body-guard of a hundred archers to wait on the governor's person, and the in signia of the order of St Michael for Angus.1 This favourable news the cardinal did not fail immediately to disseminate among his partisans ; and a conven tion of the nobility being soon after held at Stirling, it was resolved that the league with France should be maintained, and hostilities immediately commenced against England ; but with a great portion of the nobility these declarations were insincere. At this very moment Cassillis was organizing his conspiracy for cutting off the cardinal; whilst his associates, Angus, Glencairn, and Sir George Douglas, had as sured Forster, the English envoy, of their entire de votedness to his master. When the governor, there fore, assembled the Scottish host, on the 9th of August, it was strong in apparent numbers, but Aveakened by treason and suspicion. From a force of thirty thou sand men, with the veteran infantry of France, and a fine body of cavalry, including eighty barbed horse, something important Avas expected ; and the people, whose feelings Avere strongly excited against England, looked Avith eager anxiety to the result ; but they 1 Intelligence by the Lord Wharton's espiels, sent to the Earl of Hertford, June 11, 1545.

The vanguard of the army was commanded by Angus : under him were the lords in the English interest, Avith the minor barons Avho folloAved them ; and their indisposition to hosti lities completely shackled the efforts of the remainder of the army. England was indeed invaded, but the operations were feeble and disunited : Hertford had made excellent dispositions for the defence of the borders by his foreign mercenaries ; the Spanish and Italian troops repelled the Scots with great gallantry ; the preparations of many months led only to the sack of a few obscure villages, and the capture of some border strengths ; and, after two days, the army of Scotland returned, to use the words of an ancient and authentic chronicle, \u2014 \" through the deceit of George Douglas and the vanguard.\" 1 It was on the 13 th of August that this disastrous retreat took place, and, three days after, the Scottish lords in the interest of England addressed from Mel rose a letter to Henry, in which they claimed credit for the total failure of the invasion, and advised the immediate advance of the Earl of Hertford, with an overwhelming force, into the heart of the country, so well provided as to remain there for a lengthened period. They recommended him at the same time to march during the present harvest, and to publish a proclamation, declaring that he came not to hurt the realm or any subject in it who would assist in promot ing the peace and marriage betAveen the two countries.

Preparations had been already made for the intended invasion, not only by land, but for a naval descent on the west coast. Negotiations were opened, through the Earl of Lennox, Avith Donald lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross ; and this petty prince, with eighteen of his barons, disclaiming, in proud language, all alle giance to Scotland, of which realm he described him self and his progenitors as the \" auld enemies,\" entered willingly into the service of the English monarch, and bound themselves to assist Lennox with a force of eight thousand men.1 Henry, Avho had been instructed by R.

Hertford, however, brought up his ordnance, and a breach being effected, the church was carried, the steeple stormed, and its defenders put to the sword. In the meantime his friends, the Scottish earls, evaded his proposal of joining the army, and informed him by a secret mes senger who brought a letter in cipher, that they could not without danger assemble their forces till acquainted more minutely with his plans.1 No line of conduct could have been adopted more discreditable to them selves, or more unhappy in its consequences to the people. Had they been bold and consistent in their adherence to England, their extensive estates Avould have been exempted from plunder, and the peasantry would have escaped through the desertion of their lords ; but their present conduct, whilst it brought all the evils, shared in none of the advantages of treachery, and only provoked Hertford to a more cruel and san guinary retaliation.

Hertford, in a despatch to Henry, exultingly informed him it was the opinion of the border gentlemen, so much damage had not been done in Scotland by fire for the last hun dred years. Nay, so excessive was the cruelty, that it shocked even the English borderers ; and as they evinced a disposition to be lenient, an advanced guard of a hundred Irish was appointed to burn and spoil the villages in a more complete manner.1 During these disgusting scenes the Scots were in active. The experience of the last invasion had con vinced the governor and the cardinal that Angus and his associates were more likely to betray than defend the country. Huntley and Argyle, dreading the medi tated attack of Lennox and the Lord of the Isles on the west coast, were detained in their own country, and after one abortive attempt to promote union and resume hostilities, Arran appears to have abandoned the task in despair. Ten thousand men, who were with difficulty assembled, entered England near Norham, burnt a single village, and, through the counsel of the Earl of Angus, on the first appearance of resistance dispersed and returned home.2 The army of Hertford began now to suffer want in a country Avhich they had reduced to a desert ; and it Avas thought expedient to retreat.

The English burnt seven monasteries and religious houses, sixteen castles and towns, five market towns, two hundred and forty-three villages, thirteen mills, and three hospitals.2 Such were the arguments by which Henry endeavoured to persuade his neighbours, that he was solicitous for a peaceful matrimonial union between the two countries. During the invasion a characteristic trait of the Eng lish monarch occurred. Some French soldiers iu the service of the Scots deserted to Hertford, and the earl requested the king's advice whether they were to be received or trusted. His majesty, through his privy council, replied that it Avas scarcely good policy to give credit to any men of that nation with whom he had mortal war, unless they would evince their sin cerity by some previous exploit. He recommended Hertford, therefore, if any greater number of French men offered themselves, to \" advise them first to some notable damage or displeasure to the enemy;\" and he particularized the \" trapping or killing the cardinal, Lorges, the governor, or some other man of estimation, whereby it can appear that they bear hearty good will to serve ; which thing\" continues the king, \" if they shall have done, your lordship may promise them not 1 Earl of Hertford and Council to the king, Horton, Sept. 23, 1545.

Unfor tunately at this moment those invaluable documents, the letters in the State-paper Office, break off abruptly, perhaps we may add suspiciously : there is a hiatus from October to March 27, an interval of five months ; and we are compelled to trace the ravelled history of this obscure but interesting period with such inferior guidance as is attainable elsewhere. The intelligence lately received, that Beaton medi tated a journey to France, and that the nobles had consented to the marriage of the young queen to the son of the governor, stimulated the English monarch to fresh exertions.

To get possession of these, and garrison them as rally ing points for his adherents, and to carry into execution the invasion of the Avest of Scotland by Lennox and the Lord of the Isles, were the two projects which engaged Henry's attention. Lord MaxAvell, like his other brethren, had been at first kindly treated by the king on the condition of furthering his projects ; but his conduct was suspicious and vacillating; he possessed not the greatness of mind to remain in durance and continue faithful to his country, whilst he hesitated to devote himself exclusively to England.

For this disappointment Henry comforted himself with the hopes of success in the projected expedition against the west of Scotland. This prince, however, was either too precipitate or too dilatory. Donald lord of the Isles, AA'ho in August had passed over to Ireland with a potent fleet, in vain expected the arrival of Lennox, then absent with the English army in Scotland ; and after a sojourn of some months returned to find an obscure grave in his own dominions. He bequeathed, however, his affection to the English king, and the more substantial hope of inheriting his pension, to his successor in the sovereignty of the Isles, James Macconnell lord of DunyATeg ; and Lennox, having received information from Glencairn that the time wras favourable for the recovery of the castle of Dunbarton, passed rapidly over to Ireland, opened a communication with the new Lord of the Isles, de spatched his brother to practise on the fidelity of the constable, and taking the command of a body of two thousand men Avhich had been levied by the Earl of Ormond, sailed from Dublin on the 17th of November, Avith a formidable squadron.2 Such an armament, according to the opinion expressed by the Irish privy 1 Earl of Hertford, Bishop of Durham, and Sir R.

It appears that the arrival of Lennox's brother the Bishop of Caithness, and the admission of this prelate into the castle, had alarmed them. Stirling of Glorat the constable, re ceived Caithness with distinction ; yet as he had already refused to deliver the fortress to Lennox, he now de clared that he would hold it out against all till his mistress the queen was of age to demand it for herself. It was closely besieged by Arran, Huntley, and Argyle; but having defied their utmost efforts, the cardinal and Huntley, who knew that the resolution of Scottish barons in that age was sooner moved by interest than by force, began to tamper Avith the ex-bishop and the constable, and succeeded in corrupting them. Caith ness, bribed by the promise of his restoration to the see he had lost, proved false to his brother ; and Stir ling, for a high reward, was induced to deliver the fortress, in that age deemed impregnable, into the hands of the governor.2 Henry's last hope Avas thus destroyed, and the armament of Lennox and Ormond, probably informed on their passage of the disastrous result, does not appear to have even attempted a descent. Whether it retraced its course to Dublin, or, as on a former occasion, steered for Bristol, is not easily discoverable.

In his first invasion of Scotland, Lennox had lost the powerful assistance of the islesmen by his delay ; in this last expedition he was deprived of it by pre cipitation. Had he waited for the arrival in Ireland of his envoy Colquhoun, whom he had sent to the Isles, he might have met with better success. James Maccon nell, now Lord of the Isles, inherited all the animosity of his predecessor against Scotland ; and, as soon as the unsettled state of his remote dominions permitted, opened a negotiation with the English monarch, and entered warmly into his views. He proposed to Henry that Lennox should be sent with an army to the isle of Sanda beside Kentire, where he promised to join him with the whole strength of his kinsmen and allies; with Alane Maclane of Gigha, his cousin, the clan Ran ald, clan Cameron, clan Kayn, and his own surname or clan, both north and south.1 To these offers of this potent insular prince, the reply of Henry does not appear. They did not reach him, indeed, till the 15th February, 1545-6, and before he had time to open a negotiation, it is probable that the attention of the monarch Avas engrossed by the extraordinary events which took place in Scotland.

This forms the best ground for their apology in their intrigues with Henry, and their designs for the subjection of the country to England ; although it is not to be concealed, that in their secret correspondence with the English monarch, the estab lishment of true religion is rarely alluded to as a motive of action. In those early days of the reformed church its sincere converts had arisen, with few exceptions, amongst the religious orders themselves, or from the middle and lower classes of the people, men not Avholly illiterate, as they have been unjustly repre sented, but who Avere led to the study of the Scrip tures by their love of the truth ; and over whose motives no suspicion of selfishness or of interest can be thrown. When such persons were dragged before the ecclesiastical tribunals, and refused to purchase their lives at the price of a recantation, the spectacle 1 Supra, p. 313."], [362, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 356 1545. exhibited by their death compelled even the most indifferent spectator to some inquiry ; and these inquiries led, in many cases, to conviction and con version. Neither, during the whole of the period of which Ave now speak, Avere men exposed to such severities of persecution : Arran himself, the governor of the kingdom, was at one time a convert ; and so long as he continued the profession of the reformed opinions, the Scriptures, under the authority of parlia ment, Avere openly read, the neAV doctrines preached by Rough and Williams Avithin his household, and the books of the most eminent reformers allowed to be imported into the country. His return, hoAvever, to the Roman Catholic church, produced a melancholy change ; and the influence acquired over his mind by Hamilton the abbot of Paisley, had the worst effects upon the infant Reformation. His preachers, as Ave have seen, were dismissed ; the professors of the new opinions discountenanced and persecuted ; the cardinal and his party artfully represented all innovators in religion as enemies to their country \u2014 an argument to Avhich the conduct of the Earls of Cassillis, Glencairn, and the Douglases, gave much force. It was deemed impossible that a man should be at the same time a friend to the independence of Scotland, and a friend to the independence of the human mind ; the spirit of inquiry which had begun was suddenly put doAvn, and the people were compelled once more to submit themselves to those blind guides, who Avere often remarkable for little else than their ignorance and licentiousness. The Catholic church in Scotland had, indeed, in former times, been distinguished by some men who combined profound learning with a primitive simplicity of faith ; even in this age it could boast of its scholars and poets ; but at the period of which Ave"], [363, "MARY. 1545. 357 now speak, its character for sanctity of manners, ecclesiastical learning, or zeal for the instruction of the people in the word of life, did not rank high ; and the example of its head and ruler, Beaton, a prelate stained by open profligacy, and remarkable for nothing but his abilities as a statesman and politician, Avas fitted to produce the worst effects upon the great body of the inferior clergy. Such Avas the state of things when, in July, 1543, George Wishart, commonly known by the name of the Martyr, returned to Scotland, in the company of those commissioners whom we have seen despatched for the negotiation of the marriage treaty Avith Eng- land.1 Of his early history little is known Avith certainty : it is probable that he Avas the son of James Wishart of Pittarro, justice-clerk to James the Fifth ; and as he was patronized in youth by John Erskine of Dun, well known as one of the earliest enemies of the Roman Catholic church, to him he may have owed his instructions in the principles of the Reformation. Erskine was provost of Montrose ; and here Wishart first became known as master of a school, Avhere he evinced his zeal and learning, by an attempt to instruct bis pupils in Greek, as the original language of the New Testament. This ex- posed him to persecution ; he fled to England, preached at Bristol against the offering of prayers to the Virgin ; and being condemned for that alleged heresy, openly recanted his opinions, and burnt his faggot in the church of St Nicholas in that city. This happened 1 This date of his arrival is important, as it marks the commence ment of his preaching, and has been mistaken by Knox, and all our ecclesiastical historians. All are agreed that Wishart arrived with the commissioners, and they certainly arrived in the interval between the 16th and the 31st of July, 1543. This may be seen by comparing Sadler, vol. i. p. 235, with pp. 242, 245."], [364, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1545. 358 in 1538 ; his history, during the three following years, is little known ; but we again find him in England, and at Cambridge, in 1543. There his character was marked by a devotion slightly tinged with ascetism, but deep and sincere, by his ample charities to the poor, his meekness to his brethren and pupils, and the universality of his learning. On the other hand, to such as despised his instructions, there was about him a zeal and severity of reproof, which irritated the wicked, and sometimes even exposed his life to danger. Such, at least, is the description given of him by an affectionate pupil, who had spent a year under his tuition ; and it is confirmed by Knox, his early disciple. It may easily be imagined, that the appearance at this time of such a man in Scotland was calculated to produce important effects. On his return, his chief supporters were the Earls of Cassillis and Glencairn, the Barl Marshal, Sir George Douglas, and the Lairds of Brunston, Ormiston, and Calder. Protected by their presence and influence, he preached in the towns of Montrose, Dundee, Perth, and Ayr, inveighing against the errors of popery, and the profligacy of the churchmen, with a severity and eloquence which made frequent converts, and led in some cases to acts of popular violence. At Dundee, the houses of the Black and Grey Friars were destroyed -f similar attacks were attempted, but suppressed, in the capital ; and when a regard for the preservation of peace and order induced the civil authorities to interfere, Wishart did not hesitate to threaten them with those denunciations of coming vengeance, by some writers pronounced pro phetic ; but for which there is no evidence that their 1 Hamilton Papers quoted by Chalmers, Life of Mary, vol. ii. p. 403. Sec Illustrations, letter E."], [365, "1545 MARY, 359 author claimed this distinction. He enjoyed, it is to be remembered, the confidential intimacy, nay, we have reason to believe, that his counsels influenced the conduct of Cassillis, Glencairn, Brunston, and the party which were now the advisers of Henry's intended hostilities : a circumstance which will per fectly account for the obscure warnings of the preacher Avithout endowing him with inspiration.1 From the time of his arrival in the summer 1543, for more than two years, Wishart appears to have re mained in Scotland, protected by the barons who were then in the interest of Henry, and who favoured the doctrines of the Reformation. Of his personal history during this period little is known. He continued his denunciations of the Roman Catholic superstitions, and inA'eighed with so much eloquence against the corrupt lives of the churchmen, that, incurring the extreme odium of Beaton, he is said to have twice escaped the plots which this unscrupulous prelate had laid for his life.2 It was during this interval, as we have already seen, that Henry the Eighth encouraged the conspiracy of Brunston, Cassillis, Glencairn, and others, to assassinate his enemy the cardinal : of the existence of the plots against his life, Beaton was, to 1 It was a little before the 4th of September, 1543, that the riots took place at Dundee ; and though Knox does not give the date, we may presume, with a near approach to certainty, that it was at this time Wishart was interdicted from preaching in that city. Now, a week only before this, Cassillis, Glencairn, Angus, and Maxwell, with all their adherents, were mustering their forces for a great effort, and had advised Henry the Eighth to send a main army into Scotland, Sadler, vol. i. p. 278-280 ; whilst the Laird of Brunston, Wishart's great friend and protector, was to be sent on a mission to that monarch from the governor. The preacher thus lived in the intimacy of those who knew that a visitation of fire and sword was already determined on Scotland ; and he naturally, perhaps justifiably, availed himself of that knowledge to make a salutary impression on his hearers. 2 It ought to be stated that, in support of this assertion, we have no evidence from original or contemporary letters."], [366, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 360 1545. a certain degree, aware ; and, looking with suspicion on Wishart, not only as a disseminator of forbidden doctrines, but the friend of his most mortal enemies, he earnestly laboured to apprehend him. Of all this the reformer was so well advised, from the spies of the English party, that he repeatedly alluded to his approaching fate. Yet for a considerable time he escaped every effort made against him ; nor was this surprising : when he preached, he was surrounded by mail-clad barons, and their armed retainers ; since the time his life had been attempted, a two-handed sword was carried before him by some tried follower, and he himself, though generally meek and humble, showed occasional outbreakings of a courage and fire which marked the education of a feudal age. At length his anticipations were accomplished. Being at Dundee, he received a message from the Earl of Cassillis, and the gentlemen of Kyle and Cunningham, requesting him to meet them in Edin burgh, where they intended to make interest that he should have a public disputation with the bishops. Wishart, obeying the summons, travelled to the capital ; but his friends not having met him as they promised, he kept himself concealed for some days. He, could not, however, restrain his desire to address the people ; and being protected by the barons of Lothian, many of wdiom had then embraced the re formed opinions, he preached publicly at Leith, and afterwards at Inveresk, where Sir George Douglas declared his approbation of the doctrine, and his re solution to defend the person of the teacher. It was at this time, also, that John Knox, already in middle life, became deeply affected by his instructions, and eagerly attached himself to his society.1 1 Knox's History, p. 62,"], [367, "1545. MARY. 361 During these transactions the governor and the cardinal arrived in Edinburgh ; and Wishart's friends, Crichton of Brunston, and Cockburn of Ormiston, considering his residence at Leith unsafe, remoATed him to West Lothian, where he remained concealed, in ex pectation of the arrival of Cassillis.1 It is possible that the reformer was ignorant of the true character of Brunston, a dark and busy intriguer, who, for more than two years, had been organizing a conspiracy for the assassination of the cardinal. But if Wishart knew nothing of this, Beaton, as we have seen, was aAvare of the escapes he had made, and the snares still preparing against him ; and AAdien he heard that the preacher was in the neighbourhood, living under the protection of Brunston, waiting for the arrival of Cassillis, who had also offered to assassinate him, and about to hold a meeting with his enemies at Edin burgh, we are not to be surprised that he determined on his instant apprehension. That the reformer was aware of his danger is certain, for he alluded to it : Cassillis had failed to meet him ; the power of his enemies was increasing ; his congregations began to fall aAvay, yet he resolved, amid all discouragements, once more to address the people, and, in his last and most remarkable sermon, delivered at Haddington, alluded to the miseries about to fall upon the country. He then took a solemn farewell of his audience, and set out for the house of Ormiston, accompanied by Brunston, Sandilands of Calder, and Cockburn of Ormiston. At this moment Knox pressed to his side, and eagerly desired to accompany him, offering to bear the two-handed sword, as he Avas Avont ; but Wishart affectionately dismissed him. \" Nay,\" said he, \"return 1 Spottiswood's History, pp. 76, 77, 78. M'Crie's Life of Knox, vol. i. p. 42-78."], [368, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1545. 362 to your pupils : one is sufficient for a sacrifice.\" At Ormiston that night he appeared unusually cheerful, addressed the friends assembled round him after supper, taking for his subject the death of God's children, and, after having sung a psalm, retired to rest. At mid- night the house was surrounded by a party of soldiers ; a loud voice from without, which Avas immediately recognized as that of the Earl of Bothwell, summoned its inmates to surrender ; and Wishart, awakening with the clang of arms in the court, at once appre- hended the cause, and resolved to submit.1 Resistance, indeed, would have been hopeless: the cardinal, by Avhom Bothwell had been sent, was wdthin a mile, at the head of five hundred men ; and Wishart, after an assurance that his life and person should be safe, surrendered himself to his captors. He was instantly carried to Elphinston, Avhere Beaton lay, who, finding that one victim only was taken, sent with the utmost expedition to seize his companions. In the confusion, Brunston escaped to the neighbouring woods, whilst Cockburn and Sandilands were apprehended, and shut up in the castle of Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Bothwell carried his prisoner to Hailes, his own residence, and, for some time, appeared resolved to keep his promise: but, at last, the incessant importunity of Beaton, and the expectation of a high reAvard, got the better of his resolution, and the mean and mercenary baron deli vered his victim into the hands of the cardinal.2 Having secured him, Beaton was not of a temper to hesitate in his measures, or adopt a middle course. He summoned a council of the bishops and dignified clergy to meet at St AndreAvs ; requested the governor to nominate a judge whose presence might give a civil 1 Knox's History, pp. 53, 54. 2 Spottiswood's History, p. 79."], [369, "1545 MARY 363 sanction to their proceedings ; and, being refused by the timidity or humanity of Arran, determined to proceed on his own authority.1 The alleged heretic was immediately arraigned before the spiritual tribunal, and defended his opinions meekly but firmly, and with a profound knowledge of Scripture. He appealed to the word of God as the sole rule by which he was guided in the doctrines he had taught the people ; as he was ready to admit all its precepts, so was he bound, he declared, to refuse and deny every thing which it condemned, whilst he deemed of little consequence such points as it left in obscurity. He maintained his right to preach, notwithstanding his excommuni cation by the church ; and contended that any man, with fervent faith, and a sufficient knowledge of Scrip ture, might be a teacher of the word of life. He declared the insufficiency of outward ceremonies to salvation when the heart was unaffected, derided auricular confession, and admitted only such sacra ments as were recorded in Scripture. Of fasting he warmly approved ; upheld the Lord's Supper as a divine and comfortable institution ; maintained the necessity of our fully understanding the vows taken for us in our baptism ; condemned the invocation of saints, and the doctrine of purgatory, as unscriptural ; and asserted his belief, that, immediately after death, the soul would pass into a state of immortal life and unfading felicity. Whilst he defended his own creed, supporting it by a constant reference to Scripture, he did not hesitate to stigmatize the doctrine of his opponents in unmeasured terms; pronouncing it \"pesti lential, blasphemous, and abominable, not proceeding from the inspiration of God, but the suggestions of 1 Lesley, p. 191. Knox's History, p. 55-56."], [370, "364 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1546. the devil.\" The result of all this was easy to be anticipated ; Wishart Avas found guilty of heresy, and sentenced to be burned. The trial took place at St Andrews ; and no time was lost in carrying the sen tence into effect.1 On the 28th of March, he was led from the prison, with a rope about his neck, and a large chain round his middle, to the place of execution, in front of the castle, Avhich was the archiepiscopal palace of the cardinal. Here a scaffold had been raised, Avith a high stake firmly fixed in the midst of it. Around it were piled bundles of dry fagots ; beside them stood an iron grate containing the fire, and near it the solitary figure of the executioner. Nor did it escape the obseiwation of the dense and melancholy crowd which had assembled, that the guns of the fortress Avere brought to bear directly on the platform, Avhilst the gunners stood with their matches beside them ; a jealous precaution, suggested, perhaps, by the attempt of Duncan to deliver the reformer Hamilton, and which rendered all idea of rescue in this case perfectly hope less. On arriving at the place, Wishart beheld these horrid preparations, which brought before him the agony he was to suffer, Avith an unmoved countenance; mounted the scaffold firmly, and addressed a short speech to the people, in which he exhorted them not to be offended at the word of God, by the sight of the torments Avhich it seemed to have brought upon its preacher, but to love it, and suffer patiently for it any persecution which the sin of unbelieving men might suggest.2 He declared that he freely forgave all his enemies, not excepting the judges who had unjustly condemned him. The executioner came up to him at 1 Knox's History, pp. 59 66, inclusive. 2 Knox, p. 64. Spottiswood, p. 82."], [371, "MARY 1546 365 this moment, fell on his knees, and begged his forgive ness with much earnestness, as he was not guilty of his death. \" Most willingly do I tender it,\" said Wishart, and kissed him : \" Now be of good courage, \u00a9 \u00a9 ' my heart, and do thine office ; thou hast received a token that I forgive thee !\" He then knelt doAvn and prayed audibly : \u2014 \" 0 thou Saviour of the world, have mercy on me ; Father of Heaven, into thy hands I commit my spirit!\" Having thrice repeated these words, he arose from his knees, and declared, without any perceptible emotion, that he was ready. The hooks were then fixed in the iron chain Avhich was girt round his loins ; and being raised on the gibbet, and the fagots kindled, he was first strangled by the rope, which was pulled tightly round his neck, and then consumed to ashes.1 It was impossible for the people to behold unmoved so cruel an execution. It was remembered also, that the governor had refused his concurrence ; that the sanction of the civil authority had been withheld ; and the fate of Wishart Avas pronounced unjust and illegal. That many of his opinions were such as the church deemed heretical could not be denied ; but men had now begun to appeal to the Avord of God as the test of the truth ; and to be subjected to such in human torments for the declaration of precepts believed to be founded on the Bible, was esteemed monstrous. The courage, meekness, and patience Avith which the reformer had borne his sufferings, produced a deep effect, and the invariable results of persecution were soon discernible in a spirit of increasing investigation, a revulsion from the tyranny of poAver, and a steady progress in the new opinions. 1 Knox's History, pp. 68, 69. Spottiswood's History, pp. 81, 82."], [372, "366 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1546 But amid lamentations for their favourite preacher, deeperfeelings were mingled; whispers of revenge began to circulate amongst the people ; hints were throAvn out that God would not long suffer such cruelty to go unpunished ; and, in those days of ignorance, when a stern fanaticism was mingled in the same minds with the darkness and cruelty of a feudal age, an opinion began to be entertained, that the example of the Old Testament heroes, in cutting off a determined persecu- tor, was not unworthy of imitation. Such sentiments were not lost upon those men, who, under the influence of far baser motives, had, as Ave have seen, already organized a conspiracy for the assassination of the cardinal. Cassillis, Glencairn, Sir George Douglas, Crichton of Brunston, with the Laird of Grange and the Master of Rothes, had been prevented by various causes from accomplishing their purpose ; the difficulty of binding Henry the Eighth to a direct promise of reward, and the discernment of Beaton, who, although he could not wholly discover, detected the Avorking of some dark purpose against his life, had interrupted and balked the authors of the plot ; and they hailed the feelings excited by the fate of Wishart, as a new means placed in their hands for the accelerating the catas trophe Avhich they so ardently desired. With the people Beaton had formerly been popular, as the determined enemy of England ; but they now openly inveighed against his cruelty. John Lesley, brother of the Earl of Rothes, did not hesitate to de clare, in public, that he would have blood for blood ; and his nephew Norman Lesley, with Kirkaldy of Grange, had entered into a close correspondence with England.1 With these, others of inferior name, but 1 Knox's History, p. 70. Spottiswood's History, p. 82."], [373, "1546 MARY 367 of higher honesty, were associated ; and it cannot be doubted, that some men, who before the death of Wishart would have spurned at any proposal of an association with persons whose motives were so mer cenary, were induced, after that event, to applaud, and even to join in their attempt. Of all these circumstances Brunston and his friends were not slow to avail them selves : nor are Ave to forget, that if their minds had been already made up on the necessity of ridding them selves of the cardinal, the desire of avenging the fate of their friend must have whetted their slumbering purpose to new activity. It is probable that Beaton, naturally presumptuous, disregarded any open threats, as the ebullition of im potent resentment ; the voice of his flatterers amongst the clergy, declared, that his salutary severity had saved the church ; he Avas strong in the alliance of France; the schemes of the English faction had latterly been unsuccessful ; and it is said, that, adopting a prac tice common in that age, he had strengthened himself by procuring bonds of manrent from Norman Lesley, and many of the most powerful nobles. Soon after the death of Wishart, he took a progress into Angus, and Avas present at the marriage of one of his natural daughters, Margaret Bethune, to David Lindsay master of CraAvford, which was celebrated with great magnifi cence at Finhaven castle, the prelate bestowing upon the bride a dowery little inferior to that of a princess.1 When absent on this festive occasion, intelligence Avas brought, that Henry the Eighth Avas urging forward his preparations for a neAV invasion ; and he hurried to Fife, with the object of fortifying his castle of St Andrews, which he dreaded might be made a prin- 1 Knox's History, p. 70."], [374, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1546. 368 cipal point of attack, and of procuring the barons whose estates Avere contiguous to the coast, to strengthen it against the enemy. In the last invasion, the country, without a blow, had been abandoned to indiscriminate devastation ; and having resoh'ed to prevent a repetition of such disgrace, he summoned a meeting of the neigh bouring gentry to consult on the best means for the defence of the kingdom. In the midst of these exertions, he seems to have for gotten the secret enemies by whom he Avas surrounded, whilst they continued more warily than before to hold correspondence with England. In his last letters, the Laird of Brunston, whose mortal enmity to Beaton has been amply shoAvn, complained to Lord Wharton, that the King of England was neither sufficiently definite in his commands, nor explicit in his promises of reward ; but he expressed, at the same time, the readiness of his friends to serve the king, his wish to have a meeting with Lord Wharton in the most secret manner, as a discovery might cost him both life and heritage, and his fervent expectation, that although Beaton now intended a voyage to France, it Avould be cut short.1 There seems, hoAvever, reason to belieAre, that, although the designs for the assassination of the prelate had been long maturing, and were thus gradually gathering round him, a private quarrel between him and Norman Lesley, precipitated their accomplishment. This young baron, known by the name of the Master of Rothes, had resigned to Beaton, on the promise of a A'aluable equivalent, the estate of Easter Wemyss in 1 At this moment (20th October, 1545) our best guides, the State Papers, unfortunately fail us, and the rest of the history of Beaton's death is to be gathered from less authentic sources. That these friends of Brunston, so willing to obey the commands of Henry, were the same men who had formerly offered, through Brunston, to slay the cardinal, there seems little reason to doubt."], [375, "1546, MARY, 369 Fife.1 In the meeting at St Andrews he claimed the stipulated reAvard, and receiving what he deemed an equivocal reply, remonstrated with freedom ; warm words followed : the cardinal complained of insulted dignity ; and Norman, answering with scorn, departed in deep wrath. Repairing to his uncle, John Lesley, he complained of the injury he had sustained, and both were of opinion that after what had passed delay would be dangerous. Messages were accordingly sent to the Laird of Grange, and others whose readiness to join in the attempt had, we may presume, been already ascertained ; and it was determined that the murder should be committed Avithout delay. On the evening of the 28th of May, Norman Lesley came, with only five followers,to St Andrews, and rode, without exciting suspicion, to his usual inn. William Kirkaldy of Grange was there already ; and they were soon joined by John Lesley, who took the precaution of entering the town after nightfall, as his appearance, from his known enmity to Beaton, might have raised alarm. Next morning, at daybreak, the conspirators assembled in small detached knots in the vicinity of the castle ; and the porter having loAvered the draw bridge to admit the masons employed in the new works, Norman Lesley and three men with him passed the gates, and inquired if the cardinal was yet aAvake. This Avas done without suspicion ; and as they Avere occupied in conversation, James Melville, Kirkaldy of Grange, and their folloAvers, entered unnoticed : but, on perceiving John Lesley, who folloAAred, the porter instantly suspected treason ; and springing to the drawbridge, had unloosed its iron fastening, when the conspirator Lesley anticipated his purpose by leaping 1 Spottiswood's History, p. 82. 2 A VOL. IV."], [376, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1546. 370 across the gap. To despatch the porter with their daggers, cast the body into the fosse, and seize the keys of the castle, employed but a few minutes : and all was done Avith such silence, as well as rapidity, that no alarm had been given. With equal quietness the workmen Avho laboured on the ramparts were led to the gate and dismissed ; Kirkaldy, who was acquainted with the castle, then took his station at a private pos tern, through which alone any escape could be made ; and the rest of the conspirators going successively to the apartments of the different gentlemen who formed the prelate's household, awoke them, and threatening instant death if they spoke, led them, one by one, to the outer wicket and dismissed them unhurt. In this manner a hundred workmen and fifty household ser vants were disposed of by a handful of men, who, closing the gates, and dropping the portcullis, were complete masters of the castle.1 Meanwhile Beaton, the unfortunate victim, against whom all this hazard had been encountered, was still asleep ; but aAvakening, and hearing an unusual bustle, he threw on a night gown, and drawing up the window of his bedchamber, inquired what it meant. Being answered that Norman Lesley had taken the castle, he rushed to the private postern ; but, seeing it already guarded, returned speedily to his apartment, seized his sword, and, with the assistance of his page, barricaded the door on the inside with his heaviest furniture. John Lesley now coming up, demanded admittance. \" Who are you?\" said the cardinal. \"My name,\" he replied, \"is Les ley.\" \u2014 \"Is it Norman?\" asked the unhappy man, remembering probably the bond of manrent ; \" I must 1 Knox's History, pp. 71, 72.

The conspirators now rushed in; and Lesley and Carmichael, throwing themselves furiously upon their victim, who earnestly implored mercy, stabbed him repeatedly. But Melville, a milder fanatic, who professed to murder not from passion but religious duty, reproved their violence : \" This judg ment of God,\" said he, \" ought to be executed with gravity, although in secret ;\" and presenting the point of his sword to the bleeding prelate, he called on him to repent of his wicked courses, aud especially of the death of the holy Wishart, to avenge whose innocent blood they were now sent by God. \" Remember,\" said he, \"that the mortal stroke I am now about to deal, is not the mercenary blow of a hired assassin, but the just vengeance which hath fallen on an obstinate and cruel enemy of Christ and the Holy Gospel.\" On his saying this, he repeatedly passed his sword through the body of his unresisting victim, who sunk down from the chair to which he had retreated, and instantly expired.1 The alarm had now risen in the town, the common bell was rung, and the citizens, with their provost, running in confused crowds to the side of the fosse, demanded admittance, crying out that they must in stantly speak Avith my lord cardinal. They were an swered from the battlements that it Avould be better for them to disperse, as he whom they called for could not come to them, and would not trouble the world any longer. This, however, only irritated them 1 Knox's History, pp. 71, 72.

To these writers the secret and long continued correspondence of the conspirators with England was unknoAvn ; a circumstance, perhaps, to be regretted, as it would have spared some idle and angry reasoning. By its disclosure we have been enabled to trace the secret history of these iniquitous times ; and it may noAV be pronounced, without fear of contradiction, that the assassination of Beaton was no sudden event, arising simply out of indignation for the fate of Wishart ; but an act of long projected murder, encouraged, if not originated, by the English monarch ; and, so far as the principal conspirators were concerned, committed from private and mercenary considerations.2 1 Spottiswood's History, p. 83. 2 See Remarks on the Assassination of Cardinal Beaton, Illustra tions, letter F."], [379, "1546 MARY 373 CHAP.

If the fact had not been already apparent, the events which immediately succeeded the assassination >"], [380, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 374 1546. of the cardinal rendered it impossible for any one to escape the conclusion, that the conspiracy had been encouraged by the English monarch. Scarcely was the act perpetrated, when letters were despatched to Lord Wharton the English warden, by some of those numerous spies whom he retained, describing the con sternation which the event had produced in the capital, the change in affairs which was likely to ensue, and the necessity for immediate exertion on the part of his master.1 On the other hand, the conspirators, who had seized the castle of St Andrews, were soon joined by many adherents, preA'iously the most zealous supporters of the English interests; and who, although not present at the murder, believed that it would subject them to suspicion and persecution:2 amongst these the most noted was John Knox, the great advo cate and supporter of the Reformation. This extraordinary man, whose future career was connected with so many great events, was now forty years old. Born in 1505 of parents in the middle rank of rural life, and Avealthy enough to give him a learned education, he had been sent in 1521 to the university of Glasgow, where he distinguished himself in philosophy and scholastic theology, and took priest's orders, previous, it is said, to his having attained the regular canonical age. It is difficult to fix the time when his mind became unsettled on the grounds of his adherence to the communion of the Roman Catholic 1 MS. letter in State-paper Office.

The fact asserted by Beza, of his having been condemned as a heretic and degraded from the priesthood, rests on no certain evidence. It has been stated, also, by Dr M'Crie, that he publicly professed himself a Protestant in 1542. This learned author, however, has given no satisfactory authority for this fact, and I have found' no trace of such a public declaration of his belief previous to the capture and execution of George Wishart in 1545. But the step which he now took was decisive. By casting in his lot with the assassins of the cardinal, he openly declared his approval of the principles on which they acted ; and they, as we may easily believe, warmly Avelcomed such an accession to their party. Whilst such was the conduct of the English faction, the governor, Arran, and the queen-regent, exerted themselves to maintain the cause of order, and to bring to punishment those bold and daring men who had so unscrupulously taken the law into their own hands.1 A convention of the nobility, spiritual and temporal, wTas held at Stirling on the 1 Oth of June ; and nothing was left unattempted by which a cordial union might be promoted amongst the parties which separated and distracted the state. The meeting was attended by the chief persons of both factions : by the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, and Glencairn, to Avhose devotion to the English interests many of the late disorders might be attributed ; as well as by Huntley, Argyle, and the Lords Fleming and Elphinston, Avho were the leaders in the faction attached to France, and 1 Knox's History, p. 74.

This, however, Avas found a task of no easy execution : it Avas naturally strong, and its fortifications had been repaired at great expense by its late master ; on the one side the sea rendered it impregnable, and on the land quarter the thickness of its walls defied the imperfect and ill-served artillery of the times. Beaton, from a principle of security, had provisioned it fully against attack, and even were it attempted to starve out the garrison, the English fleet Avhich commanded the Firth might at any time throAV in supplies. To secure this support, the conspirators, or Castilians,2 as they Avere termed, lost no time in opening a communi cation Avith Henry the Eighth. Kirkaldy of Grange, Balnaves, and John Lesley, were sent as envoys to that monarch ; and they returned with an assurance of his assistance, on condition that they would promote the marriage between the young queen and the Prince of Wales, and retain in their hands the eldest son of Arran, who had been made prisoner at the time they seized the castle.3 Confident in their strength, the besieged derided all the efforts of the governor ; and despising the prayers and remonstrances of those ene- 1 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. ii. pp. 478, 479. 2 So termed from their holding possession of the castle of Edinburgh. 3 Anderson, MS.

Application for assistance was made to France, by Panter secretary to the queen, who was sent ambas sador to that country.2 Remonstrances against any intended interference for the defence of the Castilians were addressed to England ;3 but after every effort had been exhausted, it was discovered that the only prospect of success lay in an endeavour to cut off all supplies and starve out the garrison. It may convey to us some idea of the imperfection of the military art in these times, when we find a single castle, with a small garrison, resisting for a long period the utmost efforts of the governor. To make himself master of it he divided the kingdom into four great districts, and the military force of each division was brought suc cessively to bear upon the fortress,4 yet without any nearer prospect of success. At length, towards the end of December, the garrison showed a disposition to capitulate ; their principal defences were greatly iujured by the artillery, and they began to suffer from a scarcity of provisions and sickness.5 Had Arran 1 \"Knox, History of Reformation, p. 83. 8 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 31st March, 1547.

They consented to deliver up the castle as soon as a papal absolution was obtained for the slaughter of the cardinal ; they stipulated for a free pardon ; and, in the interval betAveen the com mencement of the armistice and the arrival of the absolution, insisted on retaining the fortress, and keeping possession of the governor's son as a hostage for the performance of the treaty. At the same moment that these proposals Avere transmitted to Arran, the Castilians sent an envoy to Henry the Eighth, informing him of their proceedings, declaring that their only object was to gain time to revictual the castle ; that they had no intention whateArer of abiding by their agreement ; and would thus be able to perform their first promises to the English monarch. For this purpose they requested Henry to Avrite to the emperor, causing him to intercede with the pope \" for the stopping and hindering of their absolution,\" by Avhich means a longer time Avould be given them to accom plish their purposes.1 Meanwhile, Arran accepted the conditions of the armistice, being solicitous, as has been alleged, to pro tract the time till the arrival of foreign assistance ; and intending to be as little faithful to his agreement as his opponents. He had despatched Panter the secretary as ambassador to France, with an earnest the castle of St Andrews.

Knox, as we have seen, had retreated into the castle and joined the conspirators. He was accompanied by the barons of Ormiston and Lang-Niddry, and their sons, whose education he conducted. In the chapel Avithin the fort he catechised his pupils, and delivered lectures on the Scriptures, Avhere a little congregation Avas soon assembled, who earnestly entreated him to preach publicly to the people. This, however, he at first per emptorily declined, observing \" that he wTould not run where God had not called him ;\"2 but they Avho Avere deeply interested in his assuming the office of the ministry, for which they believed him to be eminently qualified, determined to overcome his reluctance. John Rough, whom Ave have seen dismissed, on account i)i his zeal for the Reformation, from the situation of chaplain to Arran the governor, had taken refuge with the rest in the fortress, and on a certain day 1 MS.

In the midst of these scenes occurred the death of Henry the Eighth, which Avas followed not long after by that of his great contemporary Francis the First ; but these events did not at first materially alter the policy of either kingdom. Francis, notwithstanding his occasional political predilection for the Protestants, had been an earnest disciple of the Roman Catholic church ; and the great preponderance of the house of Guise, under his successor Henry the Second, inclined that fnonarch more vigorously to support the same party in Scotland. Immediately after his coronation, Monsieur D'Osell was despatched to that country to 1 Knox's History, p. 75. 2 M'Crie's Life of Knox, p. 40. Edition 1812. Ibid. p. 43.

Henry, it is said, on his death-bed had earnestly recommended the prosecution of the war with that country, under the mistaken idea that the Scots would be compelled at the point of the sword to fulfil the treaty of mar riage ; and Somerset, by one of the first acts of his government, showed a determination to carry this injunction into effect. On the 6th of February, Bal naves repaired to the English court as envoy from the Castilians, and received from the protector a con firmation of the annuities which had attached to England the conspirators against Beaton. It was resolved to strengthen the garrison of the castle by remitting money for the maintenance of troops; Lesley, one of the assassins, was commanded to remain at court to communicate with his friends ; and Balnaves received injunctions, on his return to Scotland, to use his utmost efforts to seduce the nobility from their allegiance to the governor.2 Somerset at the same time determined to lead an army into Scotland. He addressed a letter to the nobility of that realm, reminding them of the league 1 Lesley, Bannatyne edition, p. 193. 31st March, 1547. 2 MS. privy council records of Edward VI. p. 9. \u2014 Transcript by Gregory King, Lancaster herald."], [390, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 384 1547. by which they had bound themselves to assist the late King of England in the accomplishment of his designs ; he called upon them for the performance of their promises ; and so successful was Balnaves in his intrigues, that many of the Scottish nobles and barons shoAved a readiness to repeat the same disgraceful game by which they had enriched themselves under the former reign.1 In the midst of these difficulties Avhich disturbed his government, Arran exerted himself to create a vigorous union against the enemies of the country. Suspicious, from the experience of the former reign, that other designs than a simple matrimonial alliance were contemplated by England, and aware of the pre parations for imTading the kingdom, he laboured to attach the chief nobility to his service, to strengthen the border defences, and to train the people, by weapon schawings or armed musters, which had been of late much disused, to greater skill in military exercises: he encouraged the equipment of privateers and armed merchantmen, as the only substitute for a national fleet ; and he anxiously endeavoured to compose those destructive and sanguinary feuds amongst some of the principal barons, which had of late years greatly in creased, and, even in the midst of peace, exposed the state to all the horrors of Avar.2 Such being the threatening aspect of both countries, hostilities could not be long delayed. A Scottish pri vateer, named the Lion, was captured by the Pevensy, an English ship : in reply to the remonstrances of the queen-doAvager, it was affirmed that the former had 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office. \u2014 Laird of Langton to the Protector Somerset, August 18, 1547.

Nothing could be more welcome than this event. Dur ing the armistice, the garrison, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Knox and others, who for conscience' sake now acted Avith their party, had abandoned them selves to the most flagrant excesses, ravaging the coun try, and behaving in a brutal and licentious manner to the poor victims who fell into their hands.4 Trusting to the support of England, they had, on frivolous grounds, refused to abide by their agreement, when the papal absolution arrived from Rome ; and the governor, convinced that he had been the dupe of a convention which they had never meant to fulfil, was deeply incensed against them. Hastening back, therefore, to the scene of action, he found in the bay a squadron of sixteen armed galleons, commanded by Leo Strozzi prior of Capua, a knight 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 205.

The vessels took up their line with much skill, so as at full tide completely to command the outAvorks towards the sea. The greater ordnance were landed, raised by engines and planted on the steeples of the abbey and St Salva tor's college, which overlooked the inner court of the fortress, whilst some large battering mortars Avere dragged near the gates. During such preparations, the interior of the castle presented an extraordinary scene. Knox, disgusted by the licentiousness of the garrison, raised his awful voice, and denounced their speedy captivity as the just judgment of God. To the scoffs of the soldiers, who boasted of the strength of their toAvers and anticipated assistance from Eng land, he declared that their sins had found them out, that their Avails would shiver under the cannon, and their bodies be manacled in foreign prisons. Nor was the sentence long in finding its accomplishment. The fortifications which had resisted the ill-directed bat teries of the Scottish governor, crumbled under the more effective cannonade of the Italian commander. A breach was soon effected ; a proposal of the garrison for a sortie canvassed and abandoned as hopeless ; and, within less than a week, a flag of truce was seen ap proaching. It brought from the besieged an offer to surrender, their lives and property being secured ; but the condition was scornfully rejected by the governor and the queen. Strozzi declared that it was beyond his commission even to grant them their lives ; and if he did so, it must be with reservation that it was after wards approved of by the king his master. To this the garrison were compelled to submit. They would acknowledge no laAvful authority in Scotland; the gover nor, they affirmed, had treacherously betrayed them, and their only transaction therefore should be with the"], [393, "1547 MARY 387 King of France.1 They were accordingly conveyed prisoners on board the fleet, the plunder of the castle was seized and divided by the victors ; and Strozzi, by the advice of the governor, who dreaded it should fall into the hands of the English, dismantled the fortress, and levelled its defences with the ground. Others, however, ascribe its destruction to the zeal of fulfilling an injunction of the canon law, declaring the vengeance of extermination against any mansion that had witnessed the murder of a cardinal. The booty, Avhich included the personal property of the prelate, amounted in plate, copes, vestments, and jeAvels of great value, to a hundred thousand pounds, a prize Avhich no doubt tempted the return of the French auxiliaries to Scotland. Beaton's death was now amply revenged, and Knox's predictions fulfilled ; for the conspirators and their associates, on arriving in France, were partly distributed in the dungeons of various castles in Brittany ; whilst others, including the reformer himself, were kept chained on board the galleys, and treated Avith the utmost rigour.2 1 Anderson's MS. History, vol. ii. pp. 94, 95. Lesley, p. 194. Anderson says expressly, \" At length he [Strozzi] was content to par don them their lives, if the King of France should think it good, else to stand to his pleasure.\" Lesley, p. 194, repeats the same terms. Knox, in his History, gives a different account. The heads of the appointment, he affirms, were \u2014 1st, that their lives should be secured to them ; 2d, that they should be safely conveyed to France ; 3d, that if they chose to embrace the conditions proposed to them by the King of France, they should have their freedom, and be at liberty to enter his service ; 4th, that if they refused, they should be conveyed, at the expense of France, to what country they chose, except Scotland. I have preferred the account of the terms of capitulation given in the text, as it appears best supported by the circumstances of the case ; and it is confirmed not only by Anderson and Lesley, but partially by Buchanan, book xv. cap. 45. \u2014 \" Leonti Strozzio, ineolumitatem modo pacti, se dediderunt.\" I have been thus particular because an able author has stated that the terms of the capitulation were violated, (M'Crie's Life of Knox, p. 52,) of which I see no proof. 2 Lesley, p. 195."], [394, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1547. 388 With this success the governor was highly gratified. He already possessed Dunbarton, which the English had in vain attempted to recover; St Andrews, so lately an object of anxiety, and for the occupation of which the protector was making every effort, had now fallen ; he been partially successful in his enter prise upon the borders, and could he have succeeded in imparting a spirit of honour and unanimity to the great bodyof the nobility, there was little reason to be alarmed by the threatened invasion of England. But a discovery was made in the castle which threw a gloom over all his sanguine anticipations. In the chamber of Balnaves, the agent of the Castilians, was found a register book which contained the autograph subscriptions of two hundred Scottish noblemen and gentlemen, who had secretly bound themselves to the service of England. Amongst these were the Earls of Bothwell, Cassillis, and Marshal, with Lord Kilmaurs, and Lord Gray. The noted Sir George Douglas, the brother of the Earl of Angus, had, it appeared, sent in his adherence by a secret messenger, whilst Bothwell had agreed to give up his castle of the Hermitage, and renounce all allegiance to the governor, for which service he was to receive in marriage the Duchess of Suffolk, aunt to the English monarch.1 So much was apparent tAthe governor, but other disgraceful trans actions were in progress of which he was ignorant ; Lord Gray had not only himself forsaken his country, but Avas tampering with the Earls of Athole, Errol, Sutherland, and Crawford, whom he found well dis posed to declare their mind, proATided they were \" honestly entertained.\" He accordingly advised that some money should be given them according to their 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office.

It was to be expected that such offers would be highly Avelcome to the English government, although distrust must have been felt in dealing with persons Avhose oaths had been so repeat- edly and unscrupulously violated.

To defeat machinations which had spread so widely, required a union of reso lution and talent AA'hich he did not possess. He was aware that the country was on the point of being in vaded by the protector in person ; to have attempted to bring his enemies to justice might have thrown his preparations for resistance into confusion, and spread distrust and dismay throughout the people at a time when vigour and confidence were imperatively required. Either he ought to have pretended a total ignorance, silently taking the best measures to defeat the designs of his enemies, or he should resolutely have seized the chief conspirators ; but Arran unfortunately adopted that middle course which was sure to lead to a calami tous result: he dissembled for the moment, and delayed all proceedings against the great body of his opponents ; but he threw Bothwell into prison, and thus gave an opportunity to his associates of providing for their own safety.3 Yet in the midst of this political irresolution he 1 MS.

We have seen that, during the whole of the preced ing year, the Scottish governor had been engaged in war, and being apprehensive that the people, fatigued with perpetual hostilities, might be remiss in obeying his summons, he adopted an expedient for assembling an army, which was seldom used except in cases of imminent peril. He sent the fiery cross throughout the country ;x a warlike symbol of Celtic origin, con structed of two slender rods of hazel, formed into the shape of a cross, the extremities seared in the Are and extinguished, when red and blazing, in the blood of a goat, slain for the occasion. From this slight descrip tion, it is evident that the custom may be traced back to Pagan times ; and it is certain that, throughout the Highland districts of the country, its summons, wherever it was carried, was regarded with awe, and obeyed without hesitation. Previous to this, we do not hear of its having been adopted in the lowlands ; but on the present emergency, being fastened to the point of a spear, it was transmitted by the heralds and pursuivants throughout every part of the realm ; from town to town, from village to village, from hamlet to hamlet, the ensanguined symbol flew with astonishing rapidity ; and such was its effect, that in a wonderfully short space of time an army of thirty-six thousand men assembled near Musselburgh.

We know that in Henry Balnaves' register were the names of two hundred gentlemen, who Avere under promise to England ; and when his army lay at Newcastle, the protector received a visit from the Laird of Manger ton, and forty barons of the east borders, Avho tendered their services and were courteously re ceived.3 The little obstruction which Somerset met during the whole course of his march, may be thus explained. Having employed the greatest part of a day in con ducting the army, and dragging the artillery through this rugged pass, the duke made himself master of the neighbouring castles of Dunglass, Thornton, and 1 Situated near the northern point of Berwickshire. 2 Hayward in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 281 . 3 Patten's Expedition, p. 27."], [400, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1547. 394 Innerwick,1 and leaving Dunbar Avithin a gunshot on his right, he pushed forward to East Linton, where the army crossed the Tyne by the narrow bridge which still remains, whilst the horsemen and carriages forded the river. Here the enemy neglected another excel lent opportunity of attacking the English force when defiling across Linton bridge. They contented them selves with pushing forward some of their prickers, or light horse, under Dandy Car, a noted borderer, whose little squadron was put to flight by a charge led by Lord Warwick. Advancing past Hailes castle, which opened upon them an ineffectual cannonade, they pro ceeded, on the 7th of September, to Lang-Niddry, where they encamped for the night.2 Here, the pro tector communicating by signal with his fleet, which lay near Leith, Lord Clinton the admiral came ashore ; and after a conference, it was resolved that the larger ships should leave the road at Leith, and cast anchor beside Musselburgh, whilst the transports and vic tuallers should beat in as near as possible to the shore. The English were now aware that the Scottish army lay beside Musselburgh, and during the march of the succeeding day there Avere generally in view some small bodies of their light cavalry, which kept gal loping backwards and forwards on the eminences overhanging their line of March. On September the 8th, the protector halted for the night, and encamped near a town called Salt Preston, now Prestonpans, within view of the enemy's camp, at Edmonstone Edge, about three miles distant : on his right to the north Avas the Firth, and toAAards the south, not far distant, rose the hill of Faside. 1 All these castles were in Haddingtonshire. 2 Patten's Expedition, p. 42."], [401, "1547 MARY 395 Upon the long elevated ridges which formed the roots of the hill, the Scottish cavalry showed themselves early next morning, and approached the English van guard, whooping, shaking their lances, and attempting to provoke them to an onset. They formed a force of one thousand five hundred light horse, led by Lord Hume, and near them lay in ambush a body of five hundred foot. Somerset, however, from the forward ness of these prickers, suspected that they reckoned on some nearer support than was discernible, and gave strict orders to his men to preserve their ranks ; but Lord Grey, impatient of such provocation, extorted leave to try the effect of a charge : accordingly, as soon as they came, \" scattered on the spur,\" within a stone cast of the English, and, after their usual shouting, were beginning to wheel about, Grey with his demi lances, and a thousand men-at-arms, charged them at full speed, upon which they faced about, and firmly received his onset. The weight of the men-at-arms, however, and their barbed steeds, was an overmatch for the slight, though hardy hackneys of the borderers; and after maintaining the conflict for three hours, they were entirely broken, and the greatest part of them cut to pieces. The chase continued for three miles, from Faside hill to the right Aving of their army which lay to the south.

His object was to examine the position occupied by the Scots, and he Avas enabled to do so effectually, as the course he took ran almost parallel to their camp, which he could see distinctly. Nothing could be better chosen for strength and security than the ground whereon they lay : defended on the right by a morass which stretched toAvards the south, on the left by the Firth, and in front, looking eastAvard, by the river Esk, which took its course between them and the enemy. Over this river, to the north and near the Firth, was the bridge of Musselburgh, upon which they had placed their ordnance, so that it was evident to the English commander, upon a slight inspection, that if they chose to keep their position, it would be impossible to attack them with advantage, or bring them to a battle. Somerset, however, did not fail to observe, that their camp was partially commanded by the hill of Inveresk, and by the higher parts of the lane Avhich led from Faside hill ; and having resolved to occupy these places with his ordnance, with the object of forcing them to dislodge from their strong ground, he rode back to his own camp. On the road he was overtaken by a Scottish herald, with his tabard on, accompanied by a trumpeter, who brought a message from the governor. The herald said his first errand was for an exchange of prisoners, his second to declare that his master, eager to avoid the effusion of Christian blood, was willing to allow him to retreat without molestation and upon honourable conditions. The trumpeter next addressed the duke, informing him that, in case such terms were not ac cepted, his master the Earl of Huntley, Avilling to bring the quarrel to a speedy conclusion, was ready to"], [403, "1547 MARY 397 encounter him twenty to twenty, ten to ten, or, if he Avould so far honour him, man to man. To these mes sages Somerset made a brief and temperate reply. He declared, turning to the herald, that his coming into Scotland had been at the first to seek peace, and to obtain such terms as should be for the good of either realm. His quarrel, he added, was just ; he trusted, therefore, God would prosper it ; and since the gover nor had already rejected such conditions as would never again be proffered, he must look now to its being decided by arms ; \" and as for thy master,\" said he, addressing the trumpeter, \" he lacketh some discretion .to send his challenge to one who, by reason of the weighty charge he bears, (no less than the government of a king's person and the protection of his realm,) hath no power to accept it ; whilst there are yet many noble gentlemen here, his equals in rank, to whom he might have addressed his cartel, without fear of a re fusal.\" At this moment the Earl of Warwick broke eagerly in, telling the messenger that he would not only accept the challenge, but would give him a hun dred crowns if he brought back his master's consent.1 \" Nay,\" said Somerset, \" Huntley is not equal in rank to your lordship : but, herald, tell the governor, and the Earl of Huntley also, that we have noAV spent some time in your country : our force is but a small com pany \u2014 yours far exceeds us ; yet bring me word they will meet us in a plain field, and thou shalt have a thousand crowns for thy pains, and thy masters fight ing enough.\" The herald and his companion were then dismissed, and the protector pursued his way to the camp, where, after a consultation Avith his officers, it was thought Patten, pp. 49, 50."], [404, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1547. 398 proper, notAvithstanding the challenge so lately given, to make a final effort to avert hostilities. A letter was accordingly addressed to the governor, in which Somerset declared his readiness to retreat from the kingdom, on the single condition that the Scots would consent to keep their youthful queen in her own country, unfettered by any agreement with the French government, until she had reached a marriageable age, and Avas able to say for herself, whether she would abide by the matrimonial treaty with England. Had such moderate and equitable proposals been made previous to the declaration of hostilities, they would probably have been accepted ; but coming at so ques tionable a moment, they appeared to the governor to be dictated rather by a conviction in the protector that he could no longer support his army in an enemy's country, than by any real love of peace. On showing the letter to Hamilton archbishop of St Andrews, who was much in his confidence, he expressed the same opinion ; and it was agreed to suppress the com munication entirely, whilst a report was spread that an insulting, instead of a conciliatory message had been transmitted, requiring the Scots to deliver up their queen, and submit themselves to the mercy of their enemy.1 Such being the result of this last attempt, nothing Avas left to either party but an appeal to arms : and early on the morning of the 10th of September, the Duke of Somerset broke up his camp, and gave orders for the army to advance towards the hill of Inveresk, his design being to encamp near that spot, and to plant his ordnance on the eminence commanding the Scottish position.

The advance mustered ten thousand strong, embracing the strength of Fife, Mearns, Angus, and the west country ; it was flanked on the right by some pieces of artillery drawn by men, and on the left by four hundred light horse ; it included also a large body of priests and monks, who marched under a white banner, on which was painted a female kneeling before a crucifix, her hair dishevelled, and, embroidered underneath, the motto \" Afflict\u00e6 Ecclesi\u00e6 ne oblivis caris.\" 2 In the main battle Avas the poAver of Lothian, Fife, Strathern, Stirlingshire, and the great body of the barons of Scotland, having on the right wing the Earl of Argyle, with four thousand west Highlanders, and on the left the Islesmen, Avith Macleod, Macgregor, and 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 874.

This movement of the Scots, in abandoning their advantage and crossing the river, was viewed with equal astonishment and pleasure by the English com mander. He had dislodged from his camp, and com menced his march at eight in the morning ; and before he was half way to Inveresk, the enemy having sur mounted the hill, were seen advancing towards the English. Somerset and the Earl of Warwick, who hap pened to be riding together at this moment, instantly perceived their advantage, thanked Godfor the fortunate event, ordered forward their artillery, and taking a joyful leave of each other, proceeded to their respective charges ; the former to the vanward, and the duke to the main battle, Avhere was the king's standard.2 Warwick immediately arranged his division upon the side of the hill ; the protector formed his battle chiefly on the hill, but his extreme right rested on the plain; the rear under Lord Dacre, was drawn up Avholly on the plain ; whilst Lord Grey, with the men-at-arms and the mounted carabineers, were stationed at some distance on the extreme left. His orders were to take the enemy in flank, yet he was strictly interdicted from making any attack till the foot of the vanward were engaged with the enemy, and the main battle was near at hand for his support.

The Scottish foot were armed with spears eighteen feet in length, far exceeding that of the lances of the men-at-arms, and they knew Avell how to avail them selves of this advantage. Angus, on observing the intention of the English, had commanded his men to form in that formidable order which had often effec tually resisted the chivalry of England. Nothing could be more simple, but nothing more effectiA^e : the soldiers closed inwards, so near as to appear locked together shoulder to shoulder; the front line stooped Ioav, and almost knelt, placing the butt-eud of their pike against the right foot, grasping it firmly Avith both hands, and inclining its steel-point breast high against the enemy ; the second rank crossed their pikes over their shoulders ; the third assumed the same position, and so on, to Avhatever depth the column might be, giving it the appearance of a gigan tic hedge-hog covered with an impenetrable skin of steel bristles.1 Against such a body, if the men stood firm, the finest cavalry in the world could not make any serious impression. It happened, also, that a broad muddy ditch or slough lay between the English and the Scottish foot, into which the horses plunged up to the counter, and Avith great difficulty cleared it. Yet, undismayed by these adverse circumstances, Lord Grey, heading his men-at-arms, struggled through, and with his front companies charged full upon the enemy's left. No human force, however, could break the wall against which he had thrown himself; and in an incredibly short time tAVO hundred saddles were 1 So that it were as easy, to use the words of an eye-witness, for a bare finger to pierce the skin of an angry hedge-hog, as for any one to encounter the brunt of their pikes. \u2014 Patten, p. 59."], [409, "1547 MARY 403 emptied, the horses being stabbed in the belly with the spears, and the riders who had fallen speedily de spatched by i\\ieivhingers,ox short double-edged daggers, which the Scots carried at their girdle.

At this critical moment, had Angus been supported by the rest of the army, or had the Scots possessed any body of men-at-arms, who by a timely charge might have improved their advantage, the English would in all probability have been undone.2 But the cavalry had been nearly cut to pieces in the action of the day before, and the centre and rear under the governor and Huntley were still at a considerable distance ; the vanward, therefore, unable to pursue the fugitives, and not choosing to advance against the main body of the enemy till certain of support, halted for a brief space. The opportunity was thus lost ; and the Earl of Warwick, aware of the infinite value of a few minutes gained at such a juncture, galloped through the wavering ranks of the achrance, re-estab- 1 Lord Herries' Memoirs, p. 20. 2 Hayward in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 284.

These fine troops, armed both man and horse in complete mail, galloped up to the brink of the broad ditch, and, coming within half-musket range, discharged their pieces full in the faces of the Scottish infantry.1 This attack was seconded by Sir Peter MewTtas, who brought up his foot hagbutteers : the archers, now moving rapidly forward, discharged a flight of arrows ; and at the same moment the artillery, which had been judiciously placed on the hill, were made to bear upon Angus's division, who, dreading the effect of so complicated an attack, began to fall back, though in good order, to the main battle. At this instant the Highlanders, who, unable to resist their plundering propensities, were dispersed over the field stripping the slain, mistook this retrograde movement for a flight, and, seized with a sudden panic, began to run off in all directions. Their terror communicated itself to the burgh troops : these formed a main portion of the centre, and, starting from their ranks, although still a quarter of a mile distant from the enemy, they threw aAvay their Aveapons and followed the Highlanders. In the midst of this shameful confusion, the governor, instead of exerting himself to rallythe fugitives, shouted \"Treason,\" a cry which only increased the disorder. The Earl of Warwick, meanwhile, was coming fast forward, the horsemen once more showed themselves ready to charge, and the English centre and rear hastened on at an accelerated pace.

Every thing was now lost : the ground over which the flight lay was as thickly strewed with pikes as a floor with rushes ; helmets, bucklers, swords, daggers, and steel caps, lay scattered on every side, cast away by their owners, as impeding their speed ; and the chase, beginning at one o'clock, continued till six in the evening with extraordinary slaughter. The English demi-lances and men-at-arms, irritated by their late defeat, hastened after the fugitives with a speed height- ened by revenge,1 and passing across the field of their late action, were doubly exasperated byseeing thebodies of their brave companions, strips by the Highlanders, lying all naked and mangled before their eyes. Crying to one another to remember Peniel Heugh, the spot where Sir Ralph Eure and his company had, in a former year,2 been cut to pieces by the Earl of Angus, they spurred at the top of their speed after the fugi- tives, cutting them down on all sides, and admitting none to quarter, but those from whom they hopedTor a heavy ransom.

The object was to create a diversion in these parts, and prevent them from send ing their force to join the main army of Scotland.

The queen-mother, a woman of much spirit and political talent, seized the oppor tunity to infuse vigour and decision into the national councils. Meeting the governor, who immediately after his defeat had hurried to Stirling, she assembled the nobility around her, and proposed that a new army should be levied, whilst ambassadors should be despatched to France with a request for instant assis tance.

To these proposals the Scottish parliament unanimously agreed, under the single condition, that the French monarch should solemnly promise to preserve the laws and liberties of the realm of Scotland as they had existed under the race of her own kings.

The castle of Hume was retaken ; the governor of Haddington, Sir James Wilford, made prisoner, and the party he commanded entirely defeated : the German garrison, Avhich had been left in Coldingham, were cut to pieces; the enemy expelled from their fortifications in Inchkeith ; the important strength of Fastcastle recovered by strata gem ; and the English at length compelled to abandon Haddington, the defence of which had cost them so much blood and treasure.1 But the employment of foreign troops generally brings some calamity along with it : if successful, they insist on a monopoly of the glory; if defeated, they throw the blame upon their employers, and in either case jealousy and heartburn ings arise. These causes seem to have operated to their full extent during the campaigns of the French in Scotland, and at last broke out in a tumult in the capital, Avhich was only appeased after the death of the Laird of Stenhouse the provost, and the slaughter of many of the citizens.2 In the course of these transactions, a reinforcement of a thousand foot and three hundred horse arrived from France,3 under the command of De Thermes, an experienced officer, who prosecuted the war with such vigour and ability that the English were every where defeated, aud compelled at last to surrender the castle 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 49.

Had their measures been more judicious, and the mode of courtship less boisterous, the match, under due restrictions, might have proved acceptable to the governor, the nobles, and the common people ; but the violence of the protector defeated his object, threw his enemy into the arms of France, and ren dered the breach between the two nations still wider than before.

Nor did they find it difficult to bring over the French monarch to their opinion.

Some time before this the Master of Erskine, and Sinclair the President of the Session, had proceeded on an embassy to Flanders, Avhere they concluded a peace with the emperor;4 and tranquillity being thus established abroad, the queen, on her return to Scotland, devoted her undivided energy to the com position of all differences amongst the nobility, and the establishment of order and good government.

A vain attempt was made to fix the prices of wine and of provisions, and repress the inordinate luxury of the table.2 An enactment was passed against the sins affirmed to be scandalously common : of adul tery, bigamy, blasphemous swearing, and indecent behaviour during public worship ; and the press, which it is declared had teemed with leAvd rhymes and ballads, with scandalous songs and tragedies, Avas sub jected to the censorship of an ordinary, and restricted by a law which compelled every printer to obtain a licence from the queen and the governor.3 Subsequently to this, Arran took his progress through the northern parts of the kingdom, holding justice courts in the principal toAvns, and proceeded afterwards, accompanied by the queen-regent, to visit for the same purpose the Avestern and southern dis tricts of the realm.

To compose this rude state of things required a union of energy and address which might have been deemed beyond the abilities of Arran, but his exertions were seconded by the queen-mother, who bent all her efforts to the task ; and it says much for her talent, temper, and good sense, that the measures which she adopted were successful. The clergy were satisfied, the nobles reconciled amongst themselves, the lower orders induced rather than compelled to respect the laws; and Mary of Guise, by her prudence and popular manners, so firmly attached all orders to her party, that the governor began to dread he would be univer sally deserted.1 This moment Avas artfully seized by her to remind Arran that it was now time for him to fulfil his pro mise, and resign the regency in her favour ; but she met with au indignant refusal. He declared his resolution to retain the high office, Avhich belonged to his rank as nearest heir to the crown ; insisted that no such overtures could be entertained till the young queen had at least reached the age of twelve years ; and so deeply resented the proposal, that he remained in Edinburgh Avith the few lords Avho still embraced his party, whilst the dowager held a brilliant court at Stirling.2 He contended, and Avith truth, that since the peace Avith England he had devoted himself Avith 1 Lesley, p. 245. 2 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 891 .

These proud and resentful feelings, so opposite to the sentiments which he had expressed in 1551, were supposed to be in stilled into the mind of Arran by his brother the primate of St Andrews, who had now recovered his health,1 and Avith it his influence over the easy tem per of his relative. A determined opposition was thus reorganized against the queen-mother : the archbishop represented to his brother the madness of retiring from the supreme power, when nothing stood between him and the crown but the life of a feeble girl ;2 and nearly a year was spent in mutual crimina tion and intrigue. The party of the governor, however, at length be came so insignificant, that the primate was the only man of consequence left to him ; and the queen, con fident in her strength, threatened to call a parliament and exact an account of his administration of the royal revenue.

They then devolved their authority upon the queen-dowager, and although Arran pleaded justly that the transaction was illegal, the young Mary being still in her minority, the objec tion was overruled, and he at last reluctantly con sented to his abdication. A parliament accordingly assembled at Edinburgh, on the 12th of April, 1554, in which this solemn transaction was completed. The various instruments of agreement which had been entered into with Arran were first produced. They conferred on him the duchy of Chastelherault, and gave him an ample ap proval of the mode in which he had managed, and the purposes to Avhich he had applied, the revenue of the crown ; he was permitted to retain the castle of Dun barton till the Scottish queen attained majority ; and he was lastly declared the second person in the realm, and, failing the queen, nearest heir to the crown. To these contracts the spiritual and temporal peers having affixed their seals, the Duke of Chastelherault, in the presence of the estates of the realm, resigned the ensigns of his authority into the hands of the queen dowager ; a commission by the Queen of Scotland was next produced and read, which appointed her mother, Mary of Lorraine, regent of her realm ; and that princess, rising from her seat, accepted the office, and received the homage and congratulations of the assembled nobility.

It is difficult, from the conflicting accounts of historians, to arrive at the numbers of each army in the battle of Flodden ; and even more difficult to estimate the loss on both sides. That nearly a hundred thousand souls mustered on the Borough-muir is extremely probable ; but it is to be recollected, that of these a great many were wagoners, sutlers, servants, and camp followers ; that the presence of the king and the whole body of the nobles inferred the attendance of more than the usual number of servants ; and that, owing to the delay in active operations, and the scarcity of provisions, the army was diminished by desertion previous to the battle. When this is considered, the estimate of thirty-five or forty thousand men (the latter number is that of Dr Lingard) is probably pretty near the truth. On the side of the English, it is certain, from the English contemporary account of the battle, that Surrey's army was, at the lowest computation, twenty-six thousand strong ; and it is by no means improbable that this was rather a low estimate.1 The battle began between four and five in the afternoon of the 5th of September, and continued, accord ing to an 2 authentic contemporary chronicle, \" within night,\" that is, some time after nightfall ; all accounts agreeing that the combatants were only separated by darkness. It is a mistake in Lingard, there fore, to tell us it was decided in something more than an hour. From 1 The rare contemporary tract reprinted by my friend Mr Pitcairn, and entitled, \" Batayle of Floddon-felde, called Brainston Moore,\" thus com mences :\u2014 \" The maner of th' advauncyng of my lord of Surrey, tresourier and marshall of Englande, and levetenente generall of the north parties of the same, with xxvi M. towards the kynge of Scotts and his armye, vewed and nombred to an hundrede thousaude men at the leest.\" a Ibid. p. 12."], [442, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 436 half-past four on the 5th of September, till after nightfall, will give a continuance to the combat of at least three hours. As to the loss sustained, the common estimate of ten thousand Scots is probably under the truth. After giving the names of the nobles and chiefs who were slain, the ancient chronicle already quoted observes, that over and above the said persons, eleven or twelve thousand of the Scots who were slain were viewed by my Lord Dacre,1 and on the inscrip tion on Surrey's monument at Thetford, the number is seventeen thousand.3 But whilst this last, which may be considered an eulogis tic estimate, is yet perhaps not very far from the truth, it is evident that there is an endeavour on the part of the English historians to conceal their own loss, when they state it at fifteen hundred men. Holinshed, who gives this, admits that the \" victory was dearly bought on the side of the English,\" and when it is considered that it was a fair stand up fight, which lasted with the utmost obstinacy for three hours, that no pursuit took place till next day, and that no quarter was given on either side, the assertion that only fifteen hundred Eng lish were slain, cannot be believed. In noticing the very few Scottish prisoners taken, the ancient English account of the battle observes, \" many other Scottish prisoners could and might have been taken, but they were so vengeable and cruel in their fighting, that when English men had the better of them, they would not save them, though it were that diverse Scottes offered great sumes of money for their lives.\" 3 Lord Thomas Howard, indeed, in his message to the king, had de clared, that as he expected no quarter himself, he would give none ; and this fierce resolution of the English admiral was probably ren dered more intense in its operation by the silence of the Scottish king, who replied with courtesy to the cartel of Surrey, but did not conde scend to send Howard an answer. With the exception of the High landers and Islesmen, the Scots preserved good discipline. Their army, when first seen by Howard, was drawn up in five divisions : some in the form of squares, others in that of wedges, and they de scended the hill on foot in good order, after the manner of the Germans, in perfect silence.* Every man, for the most part, was armed with a keen and sharp spear, five yards in length, and a target which he held before him. When their spears failed, they fought with great sharp 1 Batayle of Brainston Moore, p. 11. 2 Ridpath's Border History, p. 491. 3 Batayle of Brainston Moore, p. 12. 4 Original Gazette of the Battle of Flodden, MS. in herald's office, printed by Pinkerton.

The old account of the battle ex pressly states that few were slain by arrows, as the rain had damaged the English bows, but that most fell by the bills of the Englishmen ; and yet the armorial device given as an augmentation to his arms to Surrey, in commemoration of his victory\u2014 a demi-lion gules, transfixed with an arrow \u2014 seems to contradict this ; whilst the impatience of the Highlanders, under Huntley and Lennox, has always been ascribed to the deadly discharge of the English bowmen. The English artillery were well served, and did considerable execution ; whilst the Scottish guns, injudiciously placed and ill-directed, fired over the heads of the enemy ; a blunder probably to be ascribed to the obstinacy of the king, who would not suffer them to play upon the English columns when they were passing the river. James thus lost the great advantage which might have been derived from the acknowledged excellence in the make and calibre of the Scottish ordnance. As the battle of Flodden is of much importance in tracing the mili tary history of the country, I may notice an inaccuracy of Hume, which to the general student might seem of little importance, but to the military reader it will not appear so. This historian informs us ' that Surrey, finding that the river Till prevented his attack, made a feint by marching to Berwick, as if he meant to enter Scotland ; upon which James descended from his encampment, having fired his huts. \" On this Surrey,\" says he, \" took advantage of the smoke, and passed the river with hi3 army, rendering a battle inevitable, for which both sides prepared with tranquillity and order.\" This, any one who will study the battle as it is given in this history, from contemporary re cords, will discover to be a misapprehension of the fact.

The frequent references in the text to the first part of this work, as an original and valuable authority, renders it necessary to explain the reasons which have led the author to form a different opinion of its authenticity from that given by its learned editor. In the Prefa tory Notice to the volume, there is this sentence : \" To those who are at all acquainted with the minute details of Scottish history in the sixteenth century, a very slight perusal of the work will suggest, that a Published by the Bannatyne Club.

From the era of the battle of Flodden, and the death of King James the Fourth, in the year 1513, at which it commences, down to the termination of the government of the Earl of Arran in 1553, its details, comparatively meagre and occasionally inaccurate, are obviously not recorded by a contemporary chronicler, but must have been derived from tradition and other imperfect sources. Yet, even in this first and least valu able portion of the work, will be found many minute facts and notices that would be vainly looked for in the ordinary histories of the reign of King James the Fifth, and the first ten years of the reign of Queen Mary.\" ' In pronouncing this first portion of the Diurnal of Occur rents the work, not of a contemporary chronicler, but of some subse quent writer, deriving his materials from tradition, and other imper fect sources, the editor appears to me to have fallen into an error, which could scarcely have been avoided by one who compared the Diurnal of Occurrents with our earlier historians, Lesley and Buchanan, or even with the later volumes of Maitland. It not only is contradicted by them in some important particulars, but it contains events, and these not minute, but grave and material facts, which are not to be found in either of these authors. These events, how ever, can be proved to have occurred by evidence, of which the authen ticity is unimpeachable ; and it is the discovery of their perfect truth which has induced me to consider the greater portion of the first part of the Chronicle, entitled the \" Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland,\" as the work of a contemporary, who wrote from his own knowledge, and not a compilation from traditionary sources. I say the greater portion, because such a character belongs not to the whole of the first part ; and it seems probable that this valuable original matter has fallen into the hands of some later and ignorant compiler, who, preserving the purer ore, has in some places mixed it up with erro neous additions of his own. To support these conclusions, let me give some proofs : The years 1543, 1544, occurring in the regency of Arran, form an obscure era in our history ; and did we possess no other guides than the common historians, Lesley, Buchanan, or Maitland, we should be left in a maze of confusion and contradiction. The revolutions instate affairs are so sudden and so frequent during this period, the changes in the politics and the conduct of the different factions so rapid and so ap parently contradictory, that, without some more authentic assistants, the task of unravelling or explaining them would be hopeless. It is upon this period that the original correspondence in the State-paper 1 Preface, p. I ."], [445, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 439 Office throws a flood of clear and useful light, introducing us to the actors in these changes, not through any second-hand or suspected sources, but by supplying us with their original letters to Henry the Eighth and his ministers. Now, to come from this observation to the work entitled the Diurnal of Occurrents. When it is found that it, and it only, contains various facts, demonstrated by these original letters to be true, and which sometimes are not mentioned, sometimes are positively contradicted by our general historians; such a circum stance must create a strong presumption in favour of its value and authenticity ; that a work which stands this severe test should have been, not a contemporary, but a later production, compiled from tra dition and imperfect sources, seems to me nearly impossible. To take an example from the period already mentioned. In the year 1544, in the Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 33, we find this passage : \u2014 \" Upon the thrid day of Junii, thare was ane general counsall haldin at Stirling, quhairat was all the nobelles of Scotland, except- and the Erles of Lennox and Glencairn ; quhair the governor was dischargit of his auctorite ; and maid proclamation through the realm, that nane obeyit him as governor ; and als thair thei chesit thrie erlis, thrie lords, thrie bishops, thrie abbotes to be the secreit counsale ; quhilk lastet not lang, for everie lord ded for his awin particular pro- fit, and tuk na heid of the commonweill ; but tholet the Inglismen and theivis to overrin this realm.\" In the same chronicle, p. 34, is this sentence : \u2014 \" Upon the last day of Julii, thare was ane Parliament sould have been halden in Edinburgh ; and the governor, with his complices furneist the town, and held it, becaus he gat word the queenis grace drowarie was cummit out of Striveling to the Parlia- ment ; becaus thai yet being in hir company was full of dissait, sho past to Stirling with meikle ordinance and swa the Parliament was stayit.\" Again, in the same chronicle, p. 36, we find this passage: \u2014 \"Upon the 5th day, (1544,) the governor held ane parliament in Edinburgh. \u2014 Upon the 12th of November, the queen's grace drowrier [dowager] held ane parliament in Striveling, and thareafter the par- ties suld have met, and stayet in hope of aggreance, and the cardinal raid betwix them, quha come to Edinburgh and tuke the governor to Stirling with him, quhair gude aggreance was made to be bund to hir grace, and twentee four Lordis counsall.\" It will be at once per- ceived, that these passages embody the history of an important re- volution, which for nearly six months changed the whole face of affairs in Scotland. In May 1544, Arran was the unchallenged gover nor of the kingdom ; in June, the queen-dowager arose against him, was joined by the whole body of the peers, excepting Lennox and Glencairn, held a general council at Stirling, in which he was dis-"], [446, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 440 charged from his office, made proclamation through the realm, that none should ohey him, and appointed a new secret council for the management of the affairs of the state. In July, as is shown by the second extract, an attempt was made by Arran, who still claimed the name and authority of governor, to hold a parliament in Edinburgh ; but the queen-dowager advanced with great force to the city ; the governor fortified it against her ; she retreated to Stirling, and the parliament was delayed. Three months after this, in the beginning of November, Arran, the governor, assembled a parliament at Edin burgh ; the queen issued writs for a rival parliament, to be held on the 12th of the same month at Stirling ; and the cardinal, dreading the effects of this miserable disunion, acted as a peace-maker between the two parties, and at length brought them to an agreement. Now, of these very important events, no notice whatever was to be found in our general historians ; nay, the tenor of their narratives seemed to contradict them ; the question, therefore, at once came to the credibility of the Diurnal of Occurrents. In this dilemma I was delighted (the reader, who knows the satisfaction of resting, in re searches of this nature, upon an authentic document, will pardon the warmth of the expression) to meet with the following paper in the State-paper Office, which, it will be seen, completely corroborated the assertion of the Diurnal as to the deprivation of the governor. It is dated June 1544, and entitled \" Copy. \u2014 Agreement of the principal Scots nobility to support the authority of the queen-mother as regent of Scotland against the Earl of Arran, declared by this instrument to be deprived of his office.\" This valuable paper, in its entire state, will be given in the forthcoming volume of State Papers relative to Scotland, published by government. In the meantime, the following extract will be sufficient for my purpose.

Next came the question regarding the rival parliaments, the meeting of the three estates at Edinburgh, by summons of the governor, on the 5th of No vember, and the meeting of the parliament at Stirling, by summons of the queen-regent, on the 12th of the same month. Upon this point the correspondence in the State-paper Office was silent ; but fortu nately the evidence of the Acts of the Scottish Parliament establishes the accuracy of the facts stated in the Diurnal of Occurrents. In the second volume of the Acts, p. 445, we find that the governor, Arran, held a parliament at Edinburgh on the 6th of November ; and one of the acts then passed by the three estates, is thus entitled, \u2014 \" Deliverance annulling ane Proclamation be the Queen's Moder, and certain Lordis, of ane pretendit parliament, and of certane other pre tendit actis.\" In turning to the act we find the whole narrative of the Diurnal thus fully corroborated. It states, that \"the queen mother (I use the modern spelling) to our sovereign lady, with a part of lords and others our sovereign lady's lieges, ill-advised, has caused proclaim a pretended parliament to be held at the burgh of Stirling, 1 In the State-paper Office ; now published for the first time."], [450, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 444 the 12th day of November, instant, with continuation of days, with out any sufficient authority;\" after this preamble, the decision of the three estates is thus given, \u2014 \"the whole three estates of parliament, with the votes of many others, nobles, barons, and gentlemen, being present, has declared, and declares the said pretended parliament to be held at Stirling, as said is, and the pretended summons raised against my lord Governor, in their manner, to have been and to be, from the beginning, of none avail, force, nor effect. And such like all pretended acts made at Stirling regarding the suspending of my lord Governor from the administration of his said office, and discharging him of his authority in their manner.\" The evidence contained in this statute so clearly proves the accuracy of the Diurnal of Occurrents, that upon this point any other remark would be superfluous. A second proof of the authenticity of the same work is to be found in the accuracy of the account there given of the intrigues of the Douglases and their treasonable correspondence with England, at a time when our general historians know nothing of any such matters. Here the Diurnal of Occurrents maintains its character for truth, when examined by the severest of all tests, the original correspon dence of the principal actors in the events. Of this I shall give a striking example. In the Diurnal, pp. 39, 40, is an account of that abortive invasion of the governor, (August 10, 1545,) in which he broke into England with an army of thirty thousand men, and again on the third day thereafter, the 13th of August, was compelled to return home. Now, on this occasion, the Diurnal ascribes the failure of the expedition, and the retreat and dispersion of the army, to the deceit and treachery of George Douglas and his party.' The disper sion of the Scottish army is thus mentioned, p. 39 : \u2014 \" Upon the nynt [ninth] day of August, the governor with his company made their musters on Fawnrig Mure to the number of 30,000 men by [besides] the Frenchmen whilk [which] were 3000. And the same'day at even they passed in England, and burnt Cornwall and Tilmouth, Edderslie, Brankston, with sendrie othere towns thereabouts, and there did no other thing to their lak and dishonour.\" \" Upon the 1 The retreat from Coldingham is ascribed to the same cause, \"On the mome [morrow] the Scots, without any skaith, [harm] fled misorderlie.

Upon the 13th day of August, the Scottish men come hame, through the deceit of George Douglas, and the vanguard, who would not pass again through his tyisting.\" Such is the history of this remarkable invasion given in the Diur nal ; and to this narrative the same observation may be applied which was already made regarding the revolution in 1544, namely, that such an explanation of the cause of its failure is new to Scottish his tory and to be found in the Diurnal alone. We find no mention of any such thing in Lesley, Maitland, or Buchanan. How, then, are we to discover the truth upon this subject ? Simply by going to the letters of the actors themselves, which describe these events, and are fortunately accessible. In the State-paper Office we find an original despatch from the Earl of Hertford and the council of the north to Henry the Eighth, in which, after detailing the plan of his proposed invasion, he encloses a letter in cipher which he had received from George Douglas and the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, and Marshal. It may be well to give Hertford's description of the mode in which this letter was conveyed to him, as it contains a curious illustration of the extreme caution with which this secret correspondence between Henry the Eighth and the Douglases was carried on. \" After this device of the said proclamation, one Thomas Forster, who was of late, by your majestie's commandment, at the desire of the Earls of Angus and Cassillis, George Douglas and others, sent to them into Scotland, came hither to me the said earl, and showed me a letter sent to him from one Sym Penango, servant to George Douglas, of such effect as your majesty may perceive by the same letter here enclosed ; upon the sight whereof I willed the said Thomas Forster to go and speke with the said Penango according to his desire, with whom he hath been at the place appoynted between them, where he received of the said Pe nango a letter in cipher, sent him from George Douglas, which we have deciphered, and send both the cipher and the decipher to your majesty"], [452, "446 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. herewith.\" ' The letter here described not only establishes the fact of the general treasonable correspondence between Henry and the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, Marshal, George Douglas, and others, which i3 mentioned in the \"Diurnal,\" but contains this remarkable passage relative to the expedition of Arran into England, on the 9th of August, and his return home on the 13th of the same month, which, in the same work, is ascribed to the deceit of George Douglas and the van guard. \" Further, as to this last journey of ours, it was advised by the queen, cardinal, and this French capitaine, Lorges Montgomery. Huntly fortified this army at his power. Notwithstanding, at short, all that they devised was stopped by us that are the king's friends. Their whole intent was to have besieged the king's houses, unto the time they had gotten bargain, but all was stopt, ivhereof they stood nothing content.\" 1 Now, looking to the passage above in the Diurnal, we find it there asserted that the expedition was ruined \" thro the deceit of George Douglas and the vanguard.\" We know, from the same work, that in the vanguard were the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, and Marshal, with others. The journey or invasion took place on the 10th of August, the retreat on the 13th, and here on the 25th of the same month, we have a letter from George Douglas, and the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, and Marshal, in which they declare to the Earl of Hertford, that the whole expedition was stopped by them, and claim credit for it with the English king. This coincidence offers a fine example of the corroboration of an ancient chronicle by the ori ginal correspondence of the times ; and the learned editor of the Diurnal will readily allow, that a work thus corroborated could not have been compiled from traditional and imperfect sources, but must have been the production, not only of a contemporary writer, but of one minutely and accurately informed in the history of the times. It is for this reason I have quoted it as an original authority, and have preferred any information it communicates to the vague, loose, and imaginary details of the general historians of this period. Other instances might be given of the accuracy of the first part of the Diurnal, when checked by the correspondence of the times, but my limits will not permit me. That there are occasional errors in the narrative is not to be disputed ; but they may be chiefly traced, I think, to the ignorance or carelessness of the transcribers of the manuscript. 1 Orig.

That a noble matron, in the prime of life, and of great beauty, should be tried, condemned, and burnt, for an attempt to compass the king's death by poison, and should also have the crime of witchcraft imputed to her by most of our historians, is an appalling event. In the absence of direct proof, Mr Pitcairn, in his notes upon the trial of Lady Glammis, has adopted the story told by Buchanan, book xiv. c. 54, and repeated by all following writers, with the exception of Pinkerton : he pronounces her innocent of the crimes laid to her charge, and a victim of James's implacable hatred to the house of Douglas. The examination of the curious evidence which he has published has led me to form a different opinion. As to her being justly found guilty of treason, in assisting the Earl of Angus and George Douglas, in their attempts to \" invade \" the king's person, and re-establish their authority in Scotland, there seems to be no question. It was natural she should support her brothers ; and had her offences been confined to this, although the act was undoubtedly treason, it is probable the sentence of death would have been ex changed for banishment or imprisonment. But a little investigation will convince us, I think, that the king was not so unjust and implacable as has been imagined, nor the lady the injured and inno cent woman she has been represented. Let us look a little into her life. She married, probably about the year 1521, John, sixth Lord Glammis. He died on the 8th of August, 1528, in his thirty-seventh year ; and, about four months after his death, (Dec. 1, 1528,) Lady Glammis was summoned, with Patrick Hume of Blacater, Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, and Patrick Charteris, to answer before parliament for having given assistance to the Earl of Angus in con vocating the king's lieges for the invasion of his majesty's person.1 These men were all bold and active partisans of the Douglases. On September 20, 1529, we find that Lady Glammis and Patrick Charteris of Cuthelgurdy, a person who, in the interval, had been indicted to stand his trial for fire-raising and cow-lifting,2 obtained a letter of license to pass to parts beyond sea, on their pilgrimage, and other lawful business.3 Whether Patrick and the lady had gone upon their pilgrimage, does not appear, but she did not interrupt her politi cal intrigues, and seems to have been again not only summoned, but 1 Pitcairn, vol. i. p. 188. a Ibid. p. 141. 3 Ibid. p. 244."], [454, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 448 found guilty of treason ; for, on July 1, 1631, we find that Gavin Hamilton got a gift from the crown of the escheat of all the goods, heritable and moveable, of Janet lady Glammis, which had been for feited on account of her intercommuning with our sovereign lord's rebels, or for any other crimes.1 At this time she appears to have fled from justice, and we lose sight of her for some time ; but, on 31st January, 1532, a far darker crime than caballing with rebels, or associating with fire-raisers, was laid to her charge. She was summoned to stand her trial at the justice-ayre of Forfar, for the poisoning her husband Lord Glammis. The crimes of poisoning and witchcraft were then very commonly asso ciated, as may be seen from many interesting trials in Mr Pitcairn's Collections. The great dealers in poisons were witches, and the potency of their drugs was thought to be increased by the charms and incantations with which they were concocted : hence probably the mala fama against Lady Glammis, as a witch or sorceress. But how ever this may be, it is certain that, on February 2, and February 26, 1532, Lord Ruthven, Lord Oliphant, with the Lairds of Ardoch, Moncrieff, Tullibardine, and a great many other barons, to the num ber of twenty-eight, were fined for not appearing to pass upon the Lady Glammis' jury ;2 and the imperfect and mutilated state of the criminal records of this period, unfortunately leaves us in the dark as to the future proceedings upon this trial. The probability seems to be, that she was either acquitted, or the charge dropt from want of evidence. If innocent, she was certainly most unfortunate ; for, on the 17th of July, 1537, she was, for the fourth time, brought to trial, found guilty of having been art and part in the conspiring the death of the king by poison, and also for her having treasonably assisted Archibald earl of Angus, and George Douglas his brother, who were traitors and rebels. For this crime she was condemned to he burned at the stake, the common mode of death, as Mr Pit cairn informs us, for all females of rank in cases of treason and mur der, and from which he plausibly conjectures, that the vulgar opinion of her having been burnt for a witch may have partly arisen. Her son Lord Glammis, then only sixteen years old, her husband Archi bald Campbell, a priest, and a barber named John Lyon, were tried along with her ; the witnesses, as was usual in this cruel age, being examined under the rack, or pynebaukis. Lord Glammis, on his own confession, was found guilty of concealing the conspiracy, and im prisoned till the death of James the Fifth, when he was restored to his estates and honours, upon the ground that, in the fear of his life 1 Pitcairn, vol. i. p. 246. ' Pitcairn's Trials, vol. i. p. 158."], [455, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 449 and having the rack before his eyes, he had made a false confession.' The long extracts given by Mr Pitcairn, from the histories of Scott, (not Sir Walter Scott,) Lesley, Hume of Godscroft, and the Genealogy of the House of Drummond, seem to me scarcely worthy of the place he has assigned them,2 and cannot be quoted as authentic evidence. Scott's story is a mere repetition of Buchanan's, with some ludicrous additions of his own ; as, where he tells us, Archibald Campbell, the husband of Lady Glammis, commanded the Third regiment in the king's army. Lesley falls into blunders which Mr Pitcairn has de tected ; Sir James Balfour repeats them ; and as for David Hume of Godscroft, none acquainted with his history will trust him, when he stands unsupported by other evidence. The only authentic, and, as 1 believe, contemporary account of the trials of the Master of Forbes and Lady Glammis, is to be found in the following passage from the Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 22. \" In this menetyme, the Master of Forbes was accusit of tressone by the Laird of Lenturk, and was put in ward in the castell of Edinburgh. In the said moneth of Julii, the Lady Glammis, sister to Archibald earl of Angus, was accusit for tressonne ; her husband, Archibald Campbell of Skepnische ; her son, the Lord Glammis, of sixteen yeares of age ; ane barbour John Lyon, and ane priest, all accusit in the tolbooth of Edinburgh- The said lady was condamnit to be brynt quhell deid : scho deet ; and her husband, sone, and the rest, ordanyt to remain in prisone in the castell of Edinburgh forsaid.3 \u2014 Upon the 13th day of July, the Master of Forbes was convicted for tressonne, and drawin, hangit, and heidit.\" That there is any ground on which we may conclude that unprin cipled witnesses were brought forward to give false testimony, upon which the jury were compelled to convict her, I cannot admit ; still less do I perceive the proceedings to have been characterized by any savage traces of unmanly revenge upon the part of the king. On the other hand, it appears clear, that at this time the Douglases, whose last hope of restoration had been destroyed, began to embrace despe rate designs. \" The letters of Penman, their secret agent,\" says Pinkerton, (vol. ii. p. 350,) \" to Sir George Douglas, his employer, betray a malice, and designs the most horrid. ' The king is crazed, 1 Pitcairn's Trials, vol. i. p. 327. * Ibid. p. 244. 3 We may infer, I think, from the omission of any notice of the horrid fate of the husband of Lady Glammis, who, some time after his imprisonment, was dashed to pieces on the rocks in attempting to escape from the castle of Edinburgh, that the Diurnal was written at the very time of his trial. It is hardly possible, if it had been a subsequent compilation, that this circum stance, which appears in all our historians, would have been omitted. That the author was a Roman Catholic appears from a passage in p. 19. VOL. IV. 2 F"], [456, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 450 and ill spoken of by his people.' \u2014 ' He has beggared all Scotland.' \u2014 ' All are weary of him.' \u2014 ' James shall do the commandment of the Douglases, God willing' \u2014 ' All hate him and say he must go down' \u2014 ' His glass will soon run out.' These diabolical expressions against a prince in the vigour of early life, what can they insinuate but poison or the dagger? Could they be addressed to a person who did not seal them with approbation ? And could a more fit or secret agent than a sister be employed to promote the interests of her family at any risk ?\" If the reader will turn to Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, p. 190, and read the names of the jurymen who gave the verdict against her, he will scarcely admit the idea of her being innocent ; and it is worthy of notice, that instead of having the least appearance of its being a packed jury, some of the leading men amongst them were friends and near connexions of the Douglases. John earl of Athole, one of the jury, married Janet, a sister of that Master of Forbes who suffered for treason at the same time as Lady Glammis, and who was a sup- porter of the Douglases. \u2014 (Douglas' Peerage, vol. i. p. 141.) Robert lord Maxwell, another of the jury, it is well known, was intimately connected with the Douglases. He married a daughter of Douglas of Drumlanrig, (Douglas, vol. ii. p. 317,) and his daughter, Margaret *tVIaxwell, was afterwards married to Archibald earl of Angus, brother to Lady Glammis. William master of Glencairn, a third juryman, was also nearly related to the Douglases, and constantly of their party. His mother was Marjory, a daughter of Archibald, fifth Earl of Angus, a sister of Gawin Douglas the celebrated translator of Virgil, and a grand-aunt of the Earl of Angus, and of Lady Glammis. Gilbert earl of Cassillis, another of the jurymen, and the pupil of Buchanan, was also a firm partisan of the Douglases. Are we to believe that these men violated their oaths, and found guilty, upon false evidence, an innocent and noble lady, in whose favour they must have felt a strong bias ? Pinkerton, whilst he defends James on good grounds, too rashly pronounces the cases of the Master of Forbes and of Lady Glammis to have had no connexion with each other. There is, I think, a strong presumption to the contrary. The similarity in the charges against them, the circumstance that both were apprehended, tried, and exe cuted within two days of each other \u2014 the Master of Forbes on Satur day the 14th of July, and Lady Glammis on Tuesday the 17th ; and the fact that the object of both appears to have been to procure the restoration of the Douglases by compassing the death of the king, are striking circumstances, and look as if both plots had been coined in the same mint. The revealer of the conspiracy of Forbes was, as we learn from the extract from the Diurnal of Occurrents, the Laird of"], [457, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 451 Lenturk ; and this gentleman, we find from Pitcairn, vol. i. p. 200, was Thomas Strachan. His son, John Strachan, was accused as being a participator in the Master of Forbes's treason ; and it is worthy of notice, that David Strachan, probably of the same family, was one of those apprehended at the same time that Lord Glammis the son, and Home of Wedderburn the brother-in-law, of Lady Glammis, were imprisoned.1 David Strachan, whose piteous petition for liberation has been given by Pitcairn, vol. i. p. 206, is no where mentioned as having been concerned in the treason of the Lord Forbes. The pre sumption seems to be, that he was imprisoned for his participation in Lady Glammis's plot, and this seems in some degree to connect the two conspiracies. But all this is conjectural.2 It was not till the 22d of August, about five weeks after Lady Glammis had suffered, that John Lyon, her accomplice, was tried and found guilty of imagining and conspiring the king's death by poison, and of using the same poison for the destruction of the Earl of Rothes ; whilst on the same day, Alexander Makke, who had sold the poison, knowing from Lyon for what purpose it was bought, was also tried and convicted. Lyon was beheaded ; and Makke had his ears cut off and was banished, by a singular sentence, from all parts of Scotland, except the county of Aberdeen.3 Mr Pitcairn has drawn an inference for the innocence of Lady Glammis, from the fact that a number of lords and inferior barons suffered themselves to he fined rather than act as jurymen against her. This, however, one of his most noted cases shows to be no proof. The Master of Forbes confessed on the scaffold that he was guilty of the murder of Seton of Meldrum ; yet when tried on the 27th of August, 1530, Gordon of Achindown, Lyon of Colmelegy, and fifteen other barons and landed gentlemen, were fined for not appearing to pass on his assize. A refusal of this kind was in fact a proof of the power, not of the innocence, of the party accused. In concluding this note, I may mention that Lord Glammis had made himself obnoxious to the Douglases, and may therefore have incurred the resentment of his high-spirited and determined consort, by refusing to join them with his vassals on the noted occasion, when they proceeded against the border thieves, taking the young king along with them. \u2014 (Pit cairn, vol. i. p. 136.) It was on this occasion that Scott of Buccleuch unsuccessfully attempted to rescue his sovereign from the captivity in which he was held. 1 Sir Thomas Clifford's letter, quoted by Pitcairn, vol. i. p. 198. 2 Pitcairn, vol. i. pp. 202*203*. 8 John Strachan and Donald Mackay, were accomplices with the Master of Forbes in the murder of Setonof Meldrum.

After observing that the grand attempt on Scotland was delayed for a season, they command him, in the meantime, to make an inroad into Scotland, \" there to put all to fire and sword, to burn Edinburgh town, and to raze and deface it, when you have sacked it, and gotten what you can out of it, as that it may remain for ever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lighted upon it, for their falsehood and disloyalty.

Additional Illustrations from the Hamilton Manuscripts. Since this volume passed through the press, I have seen, by the politeness of Mr James Chalmers, a Catalogue of the Hamilton Papers which belonged to his late uncle, the learned and indefatigable author of Caledonia. These papers are in the possession of his Grace the Duke of Hamilton. The Catalogue is a voluminous one, and contains occasional extracts from the letters and documents which it describes. Of these the most valuable relate to the regency of the Earl of Arran and the minority of Mary ; and it was gratifying to find that they not only confirmed, but greatly strengthened the views which I have 1 From the MS. Catalogue of the Hamilton Papers, pp. 44, 45."], [459, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 453 given of that important period. Thus, with regard to the scheme of Henry for the entire subjection of Scotland under his dominion, and the mercenary manner in which the Scottish prisoners entered into his views, we have ample information in the following description of the contents of volume iv. of the Hamilton Papers. Volume iv. commences with December, 1542, and ends with January and February, 1542-3. It contains, amongst other occurrences, Henry's instructions to Sir Richard Southwell for conferring with the Earls of Bothwell and Angus, and also with the Scots prisoners, in order to engage them in his designs of subduing Scotland to himself, by possessing him of the government for the present, assuring the succession to him in case of the young queen's death, and granting him the tutelage of her person in the meantime, with the capital for tresses, and places of strength which he sought to have delivered into his power, together with the cardinal and another, i. e. the lord regent, whom he looked on as his most dangerous opponents. In a minute addressed to Lord Viscount Lisle, January 8, 1542-3, Henry writes, \" We have already given you advertisement how we have dis missed from hence the noblemen and others of Scotland our prisoners, and what the same have promised unto us.\" In what manner these promises were made appears from this extract from the Catalogue. Hem-y's articles with the Earl of Angus, then an exile in England, for promoting the enterprise \u2014 his open articles, as he calls them, \u2014 subscribed by the Scottish prisoners and Earl Bothwell, and his secret articles, subscribed by ten of these prisoners, the fittest, as he thought, to be trusted ; namely, the Earls of Cassillis and Glencairn ; the Lords Maxwell, Fleming, Somerville, and Gray ; and by Robert Erskine, Oliver Sinclair, the Laird of Kerse, and John Ross of Craigy. Again, in Henry's instructions to Sir Ralph Sadler, in vol. v. of the Hamil ton Papers, the English monarch states that Sir George Douglas had undertaken, not only by promise, but by oath and bond, to perform greater services than any of the rest. The treasonable extent of the engagements of the Earl of Angus and Sir George Douglas to Henry, appear from a minute of the king to the Duke of Suffolk, dated November 12, 1543, in which that nobleman is directed to expostulate with Sir George Douglas regarding a fresh demand for money from England. \" They have not stiked,\" says the English monarch, \" to take upon them to set the crown of Scotland upon our head. Where has now become all their force and courage, * * what meant they to take upon so great maistry and to be able to perform in deed so little ?\" Under tho date of December, 1543, we find a minute of a letter from the Duke of Suffolk to Henry's pensioners in Scotland, with an account of the sums of money which had been distributed to them, viz : \u2014"], [460, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 454 STERLING. To the Earl of Angus, 200 \u00a3 Glencairn, 200 marks Cassillis, 200 marks To the Master of Maxwell, 100 \u00a3 To the Sheriff of Air, 100 \u00a3 To the Laird of Drumlanryk, ..... 100 \u00a3 To the Earl of Marshall, John Charters, the Lord Gray's friends in the North, 300 marks To Sir George Douglas and his friends in Lothian and Merse, 200 \u00a3 In the midst of so much venality and desertion on the part of the Scottish barons, it is pleasing to find an exception in the Earl of Argyle, who resisted more splendid offers than were made to any of the rest. This is shown by a minute of the privy council of England to the Duke of Suffolk, preserved amongst the Hamilton Papers, by which it appears that the Laird of Drumlanrig, and the Sheriff of Ayr (Campbell of Loudon,) had laboured to promote king Henry's de signs, at some charge to themselves ; and that, in satisfaction of that charge, they had received for the present five hundred crowns each, with the promise of a pension when the good fruits of their service should deserve it, particularly when they should accomplish the treaty which they had begun with the Earl of Argyle, to make Mm a convert to Henry. To induce his compliance, they were to make him a pro mise of one thousand crowns in hand, and a yearly pension of one thousand more ; but if he would not comply, they were to \" threaten him with the wild Irish, whom Henry was to hound, and to ruin both him and his country.\" It is shown in this history, that Argyle re sisted the overtures of Henry, and that the wild Irish and men of the Isles were accordingly \"hounded\" upon him. Letter F, page 315. Historical Remarks on the Assassination of Cardinal Beaton. The assassination of Cardinal Beaton is an event which has been viewed under very different aspects by different parties. The exul tation and unseasonable pleasantry with which Knox relates the murder are partly to be ascribed to the savage times in which he was bred, and to the natural temper of this singular man, which was strongly tinctured with a love of the humorous. That he considered the deed as not only justifiable but almost praiseworthy, is evident"], [461, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 455 from the whole tone of his narrative. This mode of writing naturally roused to the highest pitch the indignation of the Roman Catholic party ; it was received with equal reprobation by the more moderate Protestants ; whilst the covenanters, driven by the harsh persecution of the government to acts similar in their manner of perpetration, although dictated by higher and less selfish motives, eagerly defended a proceeding which seemed to justify their own. The consequence of this has been, that much vituperation and inconclusive argument were elicited; nor have these angry indications completely subsided in the present day. Such feelings are particularly unpropitious to the investigation of historical truth ; and setting them aside entirely, I proceed more fully than was permitted me in the text, to investi gate this subject, and to present my readers with some extracts from those original papers and letters which throw new light upon it, and have hitherto remained unknown. Dr Mackenzie, in his Lives of Scottish Writers, (vol. iii. p. 23,) early observed that the assassination of Beaton had been planned in Eng land ; and to corroborate his opinion, published, from a document which he affirmed he had seen in the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, an extract from the letter of the Earl of Hertford, dated 17th April, 1544, and quoted in my text. When Keith published his history (in 1734) this letter could not be found; and although he gives it from Mackenzie's work, he declines pronouncing any opinion, aware of that author's great inaccuracy. When Robertson, in 1759, published his History of Scotland, he considered the subject so obscure that he satisfied himself with expressing a suspicion that there existed a cor respondence between the murderers of Cardinal Beaton and Henry the Eighth ; and many years after, when Dr Cook gave to the world his History of the Reformation, he got rid of the difficulties attending the question in too summary a manner, by doubting whether such a letter was ever written, or such a person as Wishart, mentioned as the agent of the conspiracy, ever came to the Earl of Hertford, or was sent by him to Henry the Eighth. \" The letter,\" says he, \" is entitled to no credit. It was not found by one of our most accurate inquirers into points of history, where the writer who quotes it asserts it may be seen ; and what is completely decisive, it was said to have been written two years before the cardinal's death, and could, therefore, have no relation to a conspiracy which, it is apparent, was not in existence till within a very short time of its being carried into exe cution.\" In a short historical disquisition appended to an early work, (Life of Sir Thomas Craig, published in 1823,) I pointed out the errors contained in this passage, and established the authenticity of the let ter quoted by Mackenzie, by referring to a direct answer to it which"], [462, "456 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. occurred in the collection of original letters and papers published by Haynes, vol. i. p. 34. The fact of the existence~of a conspiracy for the assassination of Beaton, which was fostered in England, and carried on by Brunston and Wishart, was thus fixed beyond question. To crown the whole, it turned out that, after an interval of many years, Dr Robertson had discovered in the MS. collection of the Duke of Hamilton, and had published in the latest edition of his history, the original of the letter quoted by Mackenzie. Thus far had the truth been ascertained, when I was last year permitted by Lord Melbourne to have a full examination of the Scottish correspondence in the State-paper Office, an event which I must consider as one of the most pleasureable in my literary life. This examination is at present only in progress, but the documents I have there found have already en abled me to trace my way through some of the most obscure portions of our national history ; and one of these relates to the English con spiracies for the assassination of Cardinal Beaton. I proceed now to point out the singular letters which illustrate the progress of the con spiracy. It may first, however, be proper to remark, that Henry's antipathy to Beaton was early excited, and soon assumed a violent form. On hearing that the cardinal had procured his removal from Lord Seton's house, where he was kept in custody, to St Andrews, the king (not aware that the crafty prelate had by this step completely recovered his liberty) proposed to Sir George Douglas, through Sadler his am- bassador, that he should be brought to England and there kept in sure custody. This was on the 30th March, 1543. (Sadler's State Papers, vol. i. pp. 104, 106.) A similar proposal for the apprehension of the cardinal was made on the 21st June, 1543, (Sadler, vol. i. p. 221,) which was reiterated in strong terms to Arran the governor by the English monarch, on the 4th of August, (Sadler, vol. i. p. 249 ;) and it appears that Beaton had received warning of these hostile inten- tions, for, on the 28th of August, 1543, he refused to leave his castle of St Andrews for the purpose of meeting with Arran the governor, alleging that he was afraid of his life. (Sadler, vol. i. p. 278.) On the 5th of October, the lords of Henry's party expressed an earnest wish that the cardinal were in the king's majesty's hands, so that he might nevermore trouble the realm of Scotland. (Sadler, vol. i. p. 312.) This rooted enmity to the cardinal, in the mind of Henry, was well known to Crichton the Laird of Brunston, a man in whose character we recognize the ferocity and familiarity with blood which marks the feudal times in which he lived, the cunning and duplicity which is the growth of a more civilized era, and this united to a fanatical spirit, which perhaps deceived him into the belief that he was a sincere"], [463, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 457 friend of truth. Busy, unscrupulous, and active, this pliant intriguer insinuated himself into the confidence of all parties, and seems to have been willing at various times to desert all, till the money of England fixed him, by the powerful chain of self-interest, in the service of Henry the Eighth. We first meet with him as a familiar and confidential servant of Cardinal Beaton, intrusted with secret letters from that dignitary to Rome, (10th December, 1539, Sadler, vol. i. p. 25,) which were intercepted by Henry the Eighth. He next attached himself to Arran the governor, who thought him worthy to be trusted in diplo matic missions to France and England, (Sadler, vol. i. pp. 186, 280;) and it would seem that on the 28th of August, 1543, Sadler had not much intimacy with him, as he denominates him \" a gentleman called the Laird of Brunston.\" In a few months, however, Brunston had deserted Arran, and so completely gained the confidence both of Sadler and his royal master, that we find him furnishing secret intel ligence to the ambassador, and honoured by a letter from the king. (Sadler, vol. i. pp. 332, 338, 339, 342.) On the 16th of November, 1543, Brunston thus writes in a letter to Sadler \" * * * I pray your lordship that I may be excused to the king's majesty, and to thank his highness on my behalf of his gentle letter, which it hath pleased his highness to send to me, the contents whereof I shall not fail to fulfil, so far as God will give me grace.\" Sadler, vol. i. p. 342. Nearly five months after this, on the 17th of April, 1544, the Laird of Brunston engaged in that secret correspondence with Henry the Eighth, in which, on certain conditions, he offered to procure the assassination of Beaton.' As the purport of both letters has been 1 His grace the Duke of Hamilton, many years ago, politely permitted mo to copy the original of the letter from the Earl of Hertford, which is in his possession. \u2014 \"Please it your highness to understand, that this daye arryved here with me the Erll of Hertford, a Scotishman called AVyshert, and brought me a letter from the Larde of Brunstone, which I sende your highness here with ; and, according to his request, have taken order for the repayre of the said Wysshert to your majestie by poste, bothe for the delyvire of suche letters as he hathe to your majestie from the said Brunstone, and also for the declara cion of his credence, which, as I can perceyve by him, consisteth in two poyntes ; one is, that the Larde of Graunge, late thresaurer of Scotlande, the mr of Rothes, th' Erl of Rothis eldest son, and John Charters, wolde attempt eyther t' apprehend or alee the cardynall at some tyme when he shall passe thorougbe the Fyf lande, as he doth sundrye times to Sanct Andrewes ; and in case they can so apprehende hym, will delyver him unto your majestie, which attemptat, he saythe, they wolde enterpryse if they knew your majestie's pleasure therein, and what supportacion and mayntenance your majestie wolde minister unto them ester th' execution of the same, in case they suld be persewed afterwards be any of their enemyes ; the other is, that in cace your maj. wolde grant unto them a convenient enterteynement for to"], [464, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 458 fully stated in the text, I shall not recapitulate it, but merely observe that, in the plot devised by Brunston, and proposed to be executed by Kirkaldy of Grange and the Master of Rothes, the conspirators do not appear to have acted from religious, or I should rather say fanatical, motives. No allusion to such is to be found in the corre spondence. Their views seem to have been purely selfish and mer cenary. The \"feat,\" however, against the cardinal, for some cause not easily discoverable, was not at this time carried into execution, and the conspiracy slept for nearly a year, when it was again revived by the Earl of Cassillis, the pupil of Buchanan, the convert of Cran mer,1 and a nobleman who, in their ignorance of his true character, kepe 15 or 16 men in wages for a moneth or two, they, joyning with the power of th' Erl Marshall, the said Erl of Rothes, the Larde of Calder, and others of the Lords Grey's friends, will tak upon them, at such tyme as your maj. armey sail be in Scotlande, to destroy the abbey and town of Arbroyth, being the cardynal's, and all th' other bishops and abbots houses and countreys on that syde the water thereaboute, and apprehend all those whiche they saye be the principall impugnators of the amyte between England and Scotland, for the whiche they suld have a good opportunytie, as they saye, when the power of the said bishops and abbote shall resort toward Edinburgh to resist your majestye's armye.

This baron, who proved himself one of Henry's most active instruments, was employed by this monarch in April, 1645, in a negotiation regarding the mar riage and the peace, of which an account has been given in the text. Previous to this diplomatic mission, he repaired to the English court from Scotland, and having received his instructions from Henry in person, returned to manage the business in the Scottish parliament. In the State-paper Office there is an original letter, dated April 2, 1545, entirely in cipher, with a contemporary deciphered copy, from the Earl of Cassillis to the king, in which he states that he had a conference with the governor and the cardinal on the subject of his mission, hut they would come to no conclusion till the arrival of the queen and the Earls of Argyle and Huntley ; and adds, that a con vention had been summoned for the 16th to determine on his offers. On the 20th of April, Cassillis again addressed a letter in cipher to the king, in which he informed him of the total failure of his negotia tion, the triumph of the party of the cardinal and the governor, and the rejection of peace with England. On the 18th of May, 1545, Sir R. Sadler, and the council of the north, wrote to the king, transmit ting a letter in cipher, which the Earl of Cassillis had addressed to Sadler. That the reader may understand the purport of Sadler's letter, I give an extract from it. \u2014 \"Please your royal Majesty to receive herewith such letters as we have received from the Lord Wharton, with others in cipher addressed unto us with the same from the Earl of Cassillis ; whereof one of them is a letter to the same Erie from the Erie Marshall, as your Majesty shall perceyve, which we have deciphered, and sende herewith unto your Majesty, both the cipher, and the same deciphered accordingly. And when it may appear unto your highness by the said Earle of Cassillis' lettres, amongst other things, that he intendeth to procure one to be sent to me, Sir Rase Sadleyr, as sone as is possible, for him to speke with th' Erie of Anguisse and George Douglas, for 6uch purposes as your highness has appoynted with the saide Earl of Cassillis. I, the said Sir Rase Sadleyr, shall not faile, as soon as I shall heare of the comyng of such a one as they will sende, to repayre to Alnewyke, there to commune with him ac cording to such instructions as I lately received from the lords of his majesty's council in that behalf, and touching such matter as the said Erie of Cassillis now hath written of to your Highness, wherein he seemeth desirous to know your Majesty's pleasure by me, I shall be ready to say and do as it shall please your Highness to command me in that part or anie other, according to my most bounden dutie.\" The rest of this letter is unimportant. From the above extract it is, how ever, evident that the king had communicated certain purposes to"], [466, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 460 Cassillis ; that Cassillis, having first consulted with the Earl of Angus and Sir George Douglas, was to send a secret messenger to Alnwick, to commune with Sir Ralph Sadler touching such purposes ; that Sir Ralph had already received from the privy council instructions regard ing this intended communication ; that Cassillis had moreover written to the king upon another private matter, in which he wished to know the royal pleasure through Sir Ralph, and that this statesman only waited to hear his majesty's opinion, that he might communicate it to the Scottish earl. The importance of this minute analysis will immediately appear. It is unfortunate that the letter in cipher from the Earl of Cassillis to the king, mentioned in the above despatch, is not to be found in the State-paper Office ; but on the 21st of May, 1545iv^|re is a letter from the council of the north to the king, informin^t? majesty that the Scottish barons, Angus, Cassillis, Glencairn, Marshal, and Sir George Douglas, had declined, as they at first intended, sending an agent to Alnwick, to confer with Sir Ralph Sadler ; and thought it better that a confidential messenger should be sent into Scotland to deliberate with them. This letter from the council of the north to the king, is autograph of Sir Ralph Sadler. It contains this passage \u2014 \" And whereas I, the said Sir Rase, was advertised from the lords of your majestie's council, that your highness' pleasure was, I should repayre to Alnwick, to meet there with a gentleman that should be sent from the Erles of Anguisse, Cassillis, Glencairn, Marshall, and George Douglas and others, for such purposes as I was also then advertised from my said lords of his majestie's council, for the whiche jorney I have been in a readiness, according to your most gracious pleasure ; it shall now appear to your highness, by the said Erie of Cassillis' lettres, that they have chaunged that purpose, and would have me send a gentleman to them with such instructions, and in such sorte, as your majestie shall perceive by the said Erie of Cassillis' lettres.\" This letter from the Earl of Cassillis to Sir Ralph Sadler, alluded to above as having been transmitted to the king, is not to be found in the State-paper Office, but its purport clearly appears from a letter of the English privy council, dated May 30, 1545. The im portance of this document induces me to give an extract. It shows, I think, that although they contain no direct mention of it, the former letters of the 18th and 21st of May related to the designs against Beaton's life, and it reveals for the first time a plot that has remained hidden for nearly three centuries. The despatch is in the hand-writing of Mr Secretary Paget, except the last sentence, which is autograph of Wriothesley, then chancellor. It is addressed to the Earl of Hert ford. \" After our most harty commendations unto your good lordship,"], [467, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 461 it may like the same to understand that the king's majesty, having of late seen certain lettres sent from th' Erie of Cassillis unto Mr Saddleyr, the same containing an offer for the lylling of the cardinal if his majesty wold have it done, and wold promise, when it were done, a reward; the other excusing the change of their purpose for sending of one from them, to meet with Mr Saddleyr upon the borders, and requiring John Forster (who, they say, being prisonir, may come well without suspition) should be sent to commune with them, and to as well signify unto them the king's majestie's pleasure towards them, as to hear again what they would do for their parts : To the first point his majestie hath willed us to signify unto your lordschip, that his highness, reputing the fact not mete to be set forward expressly by his majesty, will. not s'em to have to do in it; and yet, not misliking the offer, thinketh good ,rat Mr Saddleyr, to whom that letter was addressed, should write to th' Erie of the receipt of his letter, conteyning such an offer, which he thinketh not convenient to be communicated to the king's majesty ; marry, to write to him what he thinketh of the matter, he shall say, that if he were in th' Erie of Cassillis' place, and were as able to do his majesty good service there as he knoweth him to be, and thinketh a right good will in him to do it, he would surely do what he could for th' execution of it, believing verily to do thereby not only an acceptable service to the king's majesty, but also a special benefit to the realme of Scotland, and would trust verily the king's majesty would consider his service in the same ; as you doubt not of accustomed goodness to them which serve him, but he would do the same to him.\" 1 The remaining portion of this letter, which is an original, and signed by seven privy councillors, relates to the sending Forster into Scotland, and to other matters not important to be noticed. To go on unravelling these dark designs, it next appears, by a letter from the council of the north to the king, dated June 3, 1545, that Forster had been sent for, to be despatched forthwith into Scot land ; and, upon his arrival, Sadler informs his majesty, \" that he will write to the Earl of Cassillis, according to the directions contained in the last letter from the privy council.\" Hitherto the conspiracy of the Earl of Cassillis for the assassination of Beaton does not seem to be connected in any way with the former plot of Brunston, Wishart, Kirkaldy of Grange, and Norman Lesley ; but the above letter con tains a sentence from which a strong presumption arises, that the conspiracy of Cassillis was merely a revival of that of Brunston. \" Also, here arrived presentlie a lettre in cipher from the Laird of Brunstone, 1 Orig. State-paper Office, never before published."], [468, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 462 which we have caused to be deciphered herewith to your majesty.\" Here the despatch of the privy council, which was sent, concludes with the usual prayer for the royal health ; but in the scroll of that despatch, which is autograph of Sir Ralph Sadler, after the words \" your majestie,\" the following sentence succeeds : \" And this day Sir Thomas Holcroft showed us a cipher, which was devised hetwix him and the said Brunston, when Brunston departed last from the court, upon the perusing of which cipher we fynd it to he the very same that is betwix your majesty and th' Erie of Cassillis, as your majestie shall perceive upon the sight of it, which we send here in closed, so that it appeareth to us that both the Erie of Cassillis and Brunston \u2014 .\" Here this additional sentence, which is scored through, breaks off abruptly ; but it is evident, I think, the privy council in tended to observe, that it appeared to them that Brunston and Cassillis were in close communication with each other upon the point touching the murder of the cardinal, and, when we weigh all the circumstances, it is difficult to resist the same conclusion. Brunston formerly had sub mitted to Henry a plot for the assassination of Beaton ; Brunston was an intimate friend and supporter of the party with whom Cassillis acted ; Brunston had lately been at court, and had arranged a cipher for a secret correspondence with Sir Thomas Holcroft : at the mo ment when Cassillis again proposes to Henry the assassination of the prelate, a letter in cipher is sent from Brunston to the council of the north, and instantly transmitted to the king ; and lastly, Brunston and Cassillis are found using the same cipher. Every circumstance shows a unity of schemes, and an intimacy of communication, from which we may infer, I think, that the second conspiracy of Cassillis was merely a revival or continuation of the first by Brunston. The king, however, as wye have seen, did not choose to give direct encouragement to the proposal of Cassillis. That noble person was informed by Sadler that he had not communicated his design to the monarch, (which was untrue ;) and Cassillis, although willing to commit murder upon a written order from the king, did not choose to peril himself in any such business upon the bare recommendation of Sir Ralph Sadler. He did not even venture to reply to Sadler's letter upon this delicate point ; and, in the succeeding interview which took place between him and Forster the English agent, at Douglas, in June, he appears carefully to have avoided any allusion to the subject. The proposal of Sir George Douglas to this envoy, that Henry, \" if he would have the cardinal dead, should promise a good reward for the doing thereof,\" has been noticed in the body of this history, but Forster (July 4, 1545) returned without having had any communication with Cassillis upon the subject."], [469, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 463 The Laird of Brunston, however, was resolved that the proposal for removing their great enemy should not so easily drop ; and on the 1 2th of July we find, by the following extract from a letter of the council of the north to the privy council, that this busy intriguer had renewed to the king and to his council the atrocious proposal : \u2014 \" After our most hartie commendations, yesterday arrived here lettres in cypher to the king's majesty from the Larde of Brunston, and also to me, Sir Rase Sadleyr, which we have deciphered and sende herewith, both the cipher and the same deciphered, unto you, which we praye you to declare and showe unto the king's majestie. And forasmuch as the said Brunston doth partly in his said letters [touch] the matter which concerneth the kylling of the cardinal, because, as we perceyve by such letters, as I, th' Erll of Hertford, have received from the Lordes, you, and others of the counsaill, his majestie will not seeme to have to do in that matter, but referreth the same to the handeliug of me, Sir Rase Sadleyr : I, therefore, have taken occasion upon the said Brunston's letters to write my mind to him in that matter, in such sorte as you shall perceyve by the copie of my lettre to the said Brun ston, which you shall receyve herewith.\" ' Sadler goes on to state, that he had written before this upon the same matter of the killing of the cardinal to the Earl of Cassillis, but since then had received no answer. The rest of his letter is of little interest ; but the enclosure, entitled the \" Copie of Sir Rase Sadleyr's Lettres to the Larde of Brunston,\" which is wholly in Sir Ralph's own hand, is too important and curious to be omitted. It commences thus : \u2014 \" After my right hartie commendations, I have received your lettres by Robert Lyster, this bearar, with also your lettres addressed to the king's majestie, which shall be depesched hens to his highness with such spede as appertayneth.

Wherefore, lyke as if I were in your place, it shulde he the first thing I woolde earnestlie attempt, thinking therby for the respect aforesaide chieflie to please God, and to do good to my countrey.\" Sadler goes on to state, that if Brunston and his friends put the matter in execution, he knows so well the king's goodness and liberality, that they may assure themselves of a reward ; and he adds this remarkable sentence, \" And if the execution of this matier doo rest onelie uppon the rewarde of the king's majestie to such as shall be the executors of the same, I pray you advertyse me what rewarde they do requyre, and if it he not unreasonable, because I have been in your countrey, for the Christen zeal that I have to the commonweale of the same, I will undertake it shall be payed immediatlie upon the act executed, though I doo myselfe beare the charge of the same, whiche I woolde thinke well imployed. * * * * Thus I write to you mine owne phantasie and mynde in this matier, as one that woolde be glad to give you such advise, as wherby you shulde doo that service to God, the kinge's majestie, and your owne natyve countrey, as might also be to your owne profett, and good fame.\"1 The Laird of Brunston, however, and the friends with whom he acted, although willing for a small reward to slay the cardinal, proved as cautious and crafty as the Earl of Cassillis, and did not choose to undertake the murder without a direct communication with the king's majesty ; they had determined to have the royal warrant and writ for their reward and their security ; and on hearing that Sadler had not imparted their offer to the king, but only encouraged them out of his Christian zeal, and of his own fantasy, they for the present dropt their atrocious project. This letter of Sadler's was dated 4th of July, 1545 ; and for nearly three months we can trace nothing of the plot against the cardinal. How the interval was occupied, is shown in this history.

Beaton, however, was still able to thwart the schemes of Henry ; and that monarch evinced the continuance of his mortal enmity against the prelate, by recommending the Earl of Hertford to advise the French deserters to show their desire to be of service, by trapping or killing the cardinal, Lorges, or the governor. This was on the 9th of September, 1545, and on the 6th of October, about a month after, we find pretty strong evidence, that the plot for the assassination of Beaton had been resumed by Brunston. At this time, the following letter in cipher was sent by that busy intriguer to Henry the Eighth : \u2014 \"My deuty usit to your most excellent majeste ; it will plese zour highnes, yat at yis last convention the Earl of Lennox is forfaltit, his brother the bischoip, and the Larde of Tulibarn, continewit to the nixt meeting betuyx yis and Chrismes.

We have found him offering on 17th April, 1544, through Wishart, and by the assistance of his friends Kirkaldy of Grange and the Master of Rothes, to apprehend or slay the cardinal. We find him, on the 2d April, 1545, connected in the most intimate manner with the Earl of Cassillis, at the moment this nobleman renewed in his own person the proposal for the assassination of the 1 Original, State-paper Office, not before published."], [474, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 468 cardinal. We find him again, on the 12th July, 1545, sending a letter in cipher to the king, in which he renews the offer that certain gentlemen, his friends, were willing for a small sum of money to take the cardinal out of the way ; and now, when in these letters we find him, on October 6, darkly alluding to his hopes that the cardinal's meditated journey to France will be cut short to his displeasure, and on the 26th of the same month arranging a secret interview with Sadler at Berwick, which, were it discovered, might affect his life, and at the same moment declaring that the gentlemen, his friends, were ready to obey his majesty's commands \u2014 but that the king must be plain with them, as to what he wishes them to do, and also how far they are to depend on his majesty's support \u2014 it is difficult, I think, to resist the conclusion, that this last correspondence, as well as the former, regarded a fourth offer for the assassination of the prelate ; and that the anxiety of Brunston and the gentlemen, his friends, to know Henry's wishes, and what support they were to expect from him, arose out of the indirect and crafty manner in which this monarch, whilst he covertly encouraged the plot, insisted on making Sadler the ostensible agent in the nefarious transaction. At this critical moment, when Brunston, in his letter of the 20th of October, presses the king to be plain, the letters in the State-paper Office relative to the intrigues of this busy baron suddenly break off. Between the 20th of October and the 31st, 1545, occur a few unimportant letters, and from that date to 27th March, 1546, a period of nearly five months, there is a tantalizing hiatus. If I may be allowed a conjecture, I would account for it in this way : Henry the Eighth was, as we see, very anxious not to appear directly in the matter, hut the conspirators, Brunston's friends, would not act unless he dealt plainly with them ; they would not take the indirect encouragement to commit the murder which Sadler gave as coming solely from himself ; they wished to have the king's hand and writ to plead in their defence, and produce as their warrant for protection and remuneration, after the deed was perpe trated. I imagine the king was .driven to give this, but the corre spondence for this reason was destroyed ; hence this hiatus at this most critical moment. There are no letters to be found from 27th March to 29th May, which throw the slightest light upon the conspiracy against Beaton, and on the morning of that last-mentioned day the unfortunate man was murdered ; the principal assassins being Kirkaldy of Grange, and Norman Lesley the Master of Rothes \u2014 the very men who two years before had offered, through the medium of Brunston, to apprehend or slay him as he passed through Fife. One thing to be regretted in the disappearance of all letters relative to the murder after the 20th of October is, the want of evidence to show any recent"], [475, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 469 communication between Brunston and the assassins of the cardinal ; but the inference I think is scarcely to be resisted, that this daring and unscrupulous intriguer was as intimately implicated in the last as in the first conspiracy. At the moment of their committing the murder, Grange, Lesley, and others of the principal conspirators, were in the receipt of pensions from Henry the Eighth, and were described by that monarch as his friends and supporters ; ' and it is not unimportant to observe that, soon after the assassination, the Laird of Brunston was indicted on a charge of treason, although the process against him was afterwards withdrawn. I shall conclude these historical remarks with the following inte resting extract from the letter of a Scottish spy of Lord Wharton's, named James Lindsay, sending to that nobleman the first intelligence of the murder. It is one of three letters, all on the same subject, sent by Lord Wharton to the privy-council of England. \" Syv, to advertise zou, this satterday betwix v hours and vi in the mornyng the cardynal is slane in the castle of St Andrewes, be Normond Leslie, in yis maner : At the cumyng in of ye masonis and warkmen in ye place to the wark, Normond Leslie and thre wyth him enteret, and after hym James Melwin and thre men with him, and fenzit themselves to have spokin with the cardinal; and after yame came the zoung laird of Grange, and viii men with hym all in geir, quhilk the porter stoppit to lat in quhill ane of them strak him with ane knyiff and kest him in the hous.

State of Scotland after the Battle of Pinkie. \" The land was shamefully deserted by the greater part of its nobi lity.\" This is a severe charge ; but the following letters, selected from many others which I have transcribed from the State-paper Office, will prove that it is not unmerited. The leading nobles in Scotland at this time were the Earls of Angus, Huntley, Argyle, and Sir George Douglas brother to Angus. All of them deserted the governor, and entered into secret and treasonable transactions with England. I proceed to prove this by the evidence of original letters. On the 10th of September the battle of Pinkie was fought, and on the 18th of the same month the Protector Somerset commenced his retreat. On the 20th of October, Lord Grey of Wilton addressed a letter to the Protector,1 in which he gives the substance of an inter view which passed between him and Sir George Douglas. \"He,\" [Dou glas,] says Grey, \" liked well all the Articles, [alluding to the Secret Articles of Agreement mentioned in the text, p. 411,] except that by which, in the event of the young queen's marriage to any other than Edward the Sixth, they bind themselves to serve the king's majesty against their own country.\" \"He began,\" [I use the words of Grey's letter,] \" he began to allege what it was to forsake his native coun try and living there ; he showed me also that he had yearly of the queen a stipend of one thousand crowns, and of the French king as 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lord Grey to the Protector, Oct. 20, 1547."], [477, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 471 much ; and now, since his being with me, the governor sent for him to speak to him, and offered him an abbey of another thousand crowns by year : hut he came not at him, nor will not do ; but if I would mitigate that article, he was contented with the rest. I showed him, that if he refused part, he must refuse the whole ; * * and then at the last he granted thereunto, and hath both made his othe upon the testament to observe them, and subscribed the same for a wit ness thereof, in sort as all others have done.\" Douglas entreated Grey to induce the Lord Protector to erase this article, which Grey assured him he was not likely to do. He then communicated his \" device,\" which, with certain requests on his own behalf, Grey enclosed to Somerset. Douglas declared that he intended to go with them (the English army) himself and be their guide ; but enjoined secrecy of this private transaction, as, if it transpired, he should not be able to win his friends. I subjoin a brief abstract of the paper, given in by Douglas, entitled, \"The order of an Invasion into Scotland, de vised by Sir George Douglas, to be attempted within a month after the date hereof, or six weeks at the farthest.\" He states that the number ought to be six thousand men \u2014 two thousand five hundred to be horse \u2014 and victuals in carriages sufficient for four days, for the whole. They should direct their march, First, To Jedburgh \u2014 to meet the Lairds of Fernyhirst and Cessford, and the rest of the gentlemen of Teviotdale, who must be sent for : no manner of spoil or hurt to be done. Second, Journey to Selkirk \u2014 where they will meet Buccleugh and the rest of the gentlemen. Third, To Peebles\u2014 to meet Lord Hay of Yester. (Sister's son to Douglas.) Fourth, To Lanark \u2014 where the governor is sheriff. Here he would that the Earls of Angus, Cassillis, Glencairn, and the Lord Boyd, should come in. Fifth, To Glasgow ; and, Sixth, To Stirling.1 This crafty baron next handed in a paper, which he probably ] From a curious paper, published for the first time by Mr Stevenson in his \" Illustrations of the Reign of Queen Mary,\" p. 99, (from the Harleian MS. 289, sol. 73,) we learn that this intended invasion was stopped by the advice of Thomas Bishop, an adherent of Lennox, who, on good grounds, suspected that Douglas was acting treacherously. \" My device to him \" [the Protector,] says Bishop, \" and the Duke of North umberland, at Shene, stopt my Lord Grey from entering Scotland with six thousand men, whereof the greatest force horsemen, being then the flower of England-his journey being devised by George Douglas to have brought them to the butchery, as well was known after. The article [communication] to him in that matter at good length will declare.\""], [478, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 472 considered not the least important part of the transaction. It is entitled, The Requests of George Douglas For his own part : and consists of four stipulations. 1st, To have one thousand pounds sterling, within eleven days, to support himself, friends, and strengths, against the authority, and to have a yearly stipend of five hundred pounds sterling. 2d, His friends not to be oppress. 3d, That he may have his goods, silver, money, plate, and apparel, that he left in his hostess's house in Berwick, delivered to him. 4th, To have from the English king the keeping of the fort at Eyemouth. The Lord Grey, addressing Somerset, adds this emphatic sentence : \" Your Grace, I doubt not, considereth that this man would not be won without money, and albeit he demandeth a thousand pounds in hand, I doubt not but he will be satisfied with a thousand marks.\" These extracts sufficiently prove the venality and desertion of his country by Sir George Douglas.

At Douglas, the 18th of December. \" Your cousin, \" Lord Earl of Anguish.\" ' I have mentioned two other powerful noblemen as deserting the governor and embracing the English interest : the Earls of Huntley and Argyle. Huntley was a Roman Catholic ; his possessions and power in the north were almost kingly ; he had been taken prisoner at Pinkie, and was anxious to be permitted to return to Scotland on his parole. Argyle, on the other hand, was the great rival of Hunt ley in the north ; he had escaped at Pinkie ; he was a supporter of the Reformation, and one of the most able and ambitious men in Scotland. The Protector Somerset played the one against the other. Argyle, on the 25th December, 1547, had come to St Johnston with an army of highlandmen, thinking to annoy Dudley, the English governor of Broughty, and ravage the country, which had taken assurance of the English. Some time after this, he threatened to join the French in besieging Broughty,2 and continued these hostile denunciations till the 5th of February, 1547-8, when Sir Andrew Dudley addressed a letter to the protector, in which he informed him, that at the suit of Lord Gray (of Scotland) and other gentlemen of Angus, he had granted Argyle an assurance for twenty days for the whole country of Angus. There then follows this sentence : \u2014 \" There were two assurances made between the Earl of Argyle and me [Dudley] : the one open to the bishops and council, the other secret between Argyle, Gray, and me, to be a favourer of the king's godly purpose, and to take the king's majesty's part in the same ; on which communing, the Lord Gray borrowed one thousand crowns of me to give the Earl of Argyle to make him the more earnest in the same, as appeareth by a bill. . . . . sent your grace ... it shall please your grace to send some man shortly, with a commission aud authority to com mune with the Earl of Argyle.

On the 6th March, 1547-8, Dudley in formed the protector, that the Scottish earl had come to Coupar, and that Lord Gray (of Scotland) had ridden with Mr Brende that morning to communicate with him there. 3 The result of this communication appears from a letter of Brende to the protector. * It states, that on the 6th of that month, he, with Lord Gray, met Argyle near St Johnston's. Brende thanked him for the good disposi tion which he had shown to the purpose of the marriage. Argyle regretted the damage done by the war, and professed his willingness to work some mean for the redress thereof. Brende then wished to draw him on to make some proposal or some promise. This he warily declined, requesting him to show what the protector required. Brende then proceeds thus, \" And when I was about to declare, he had stay : ' I am held,' quoth he, ' in a marvellous jealousy ; and there be,' he said, ' certain of the council mortal enemies to your part. I would, therefore,' quoth he, ' to colour the matter, ye should devise to speak somewhat openly to me, before them, of such matter as ye think good, which shall be a mean that, without suspicion, ye may treat secretly with me of such things as he of moment.' Then called he before him the Abbot of Coupar, the Lord called Stuard, Sir John Cammel, and divers others. ' This gentleman,' quoth he, ' hath commission to me ; and, because it partly toucheth you, ye shall hear what he will say.'\" Brende then proceeded to declare the purpose of the marriage, the op position of evil men, and the cause of the war. \" And thereupon,\" says he, \" I plucked forth, and presented to the earl a parcel of my instructions, which I had drawn forth for that purpose, (nothing 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 5th Feb. 1547-8.

When this was done, the earl somewhat spoke, ' how greatly fair means might prevail in this mat ter, and how much violence made against the purpose,' which words confirmed with a churme [murmur] of those that stood about ; some what I did speak again to the purpose when violence should be used, and in what cases it was lawful for princes to use the sword. Then did he draw me aside, and allowed my device. ' Hereupon,' quoth he, ' we shall colour our treaty, and blind these wolves' eyes,' and willed me to proceed in my secret commission.\" Brende then thanked him for his good disposition, and told him, they knew he had the power, wherefore if good will were joined in him with power, there would be no further doubt of success. He (Brende) showed the great advantages which would ensue, besides the honour to himself, \" and so declared his reward for bringing it to pass,\" \u2014 that is, for accomplishing the first point of his instructions, viz : \u2014 the delivery of the queen. \" ' If all things,' said he [Argyle,] ' had chanced well, she had been in my hands ere this ; for if, after the battle [Pinkie] pursuit had been made, she had come into my country : and she wrote to me for the same purpose at the last entry of the Lord Grey. But now,' quoth he, ' she is in Dunbarton.' ' And you may easily come by her,' quoth I, ' or else devise how she may be had.' ' No,' said he, ' it is impossible ; the castle is stark [^strong,] and if force could prevail, it were unfitting for me to enforce my natural lady.' * * * After great persuasion, he agreed with me upon that point, like as it may appear unto your grace by the paper of articles subscribed with his hand, and sealed with his seal, sent herewith unto your grace. And because his resolution therein was not to the full effect of my instructions, I took advantage of his pro mise therein, and passed to the \"2nd point, which he liked well, (except the authority of the priests, not provided for in the articles,) saying, ' he would pass to the court, and persuade the governor and the queen immediately to send ambassadors for the accomplishment of it.' ' And if,' quoth I, ' they will not agree to your request, what will ye do then?' 'What would you I should do ? ' quoth he. Then I plucked forth a paper of the third degree, as I had them all four severally written, touching the taking of open part with the king's majesty, and showed it him : he required to have it, that he might read it, and examine it with himself. \" AVhen he had put the same in his bosom, we fell in the rehearsal"], [482, "476 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of divers things ; and knowing of a certain envy between the Earl of Huntley and him, I took occasion to talk of the said earl. When he heard him named, he started, and beating his fist upon the board, said, ' If ye let him home, ye mar all.' Whereupon I took occasion. ' My lord,' quoth I, ' therefore it behoveth you to take this matter on hand ; for if you will not, he may perchance he so persuaded, that he himself will enterprise this thing,' which words moved him marvellous much, and he said, 'Marry! I will do it indeed.' \u2014 Then proceeded I, ' If the governor will still see the ruin of the country, and still stand on the contrary part, what shall become of him?' 'No governor,' quoth he. 'Who, then,' quoth I, 'is so meet as your lordship ? ' 'I think,' quoth he, ' I have most friends and power.' ' If, then,' quoth I, ' we have the favour and power of England joined thereunto, who shall withstand you?' ' It is true,' quoth he. Finally, he condescended to the third article in this effect : \u2014 That if the queen and the governor would not agree to these covenants, then would he straightway repair to Argyle, there call all his friends about him, declare to them his mind, and require them to take his part in this purpose, and then to send one unto your grace, to conclude upon certain points of his proceeding before he do further. * * I perceive he would covenant to have aid against his enemies in the north by sea, and require that the Earl of Lennox should have no power on his lands in the west parts. When I saw he had thus condescended, I did not touch the fourth degree, other wise than that he should lett [hinder] the conveyance away of the queen.\" Brende then promised him an assurance for his country for fifteen days. At first Argyle would not subscribe, or set his seal to the agreements which Brende had drawn. The English envoy then broke off ; but late in the night, when all were in bed, he sent Lord Gray to urge Argyle, \" and finally, after four or five times going and com ing betwixt us in the dead time of night, he at last was brought to such case, that in the morning he signed.\" Argyle's character as given by Brende, is this : \u2014 \"I have heard him reported to be much constant. I found him humane, wise, and grave, in whom I could have believed all things that he said, if I had not determined in them to trust nothing at all. I judge him greedy of gear, desirous of au thority, * * * and therefore moved unto this by the envy he beareth to the governor, and the emulation he hath with the Earl of Huntley, which will be ever of the contrary part to him : therefore the matter, in my opinion, consisteth in this point, \u2014 whether your grace's purpose may take better effect in letting the Earl of Huntley home so as to raise factions betwixt them, or else, by detaining him,"], [483, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 477 to have the Earl of Argyle wholly in that part, if so be he will stand unto his promise.\" \u2014 The letter which contains the above interesting details, is dated Warkworth, 9th March, 1547-8, and signed, John Brende. Notwithstanding the promise to Argyle, the protector entered into a secret agreement with the Earl of Huntley, who engaged, if allowed to return home, to embrace the English faction, and further the king's (Edward VI.) majesty's affairs. This appears from the following letter of Huntley to the protector, dated Newcastle, 20th March, 1547-8.1 The Earl of Huntley to the Protector. \" My Lord, \u2014 After most humble commendations of service unto your grace, it pleases you to wit : We arrived at Newcastle, 18th, and has heard no word of Scotland yet, except a man of mine who came with my Lord Gray, lieutenant, and met me by the way.

As some obscurity hangs over the arrival of the French auxiliaries in Scotland, it will be useful to fix precisely the dates, which are not very clearly given either by Keith or by Robertson. The following abstract of a letter from Sir R. Bulmer to the protector, marks, the arrival of the first band of French, chiefly officers, to have been on the 25th December, 1547. Sir Ralph Bulmer to the Protector. He sends his grace these news, which had been brought by the Lord of Cessford. \" Christmas day last past, two French ships came to Dunbarton, there landed with fifty French captains, bringing money to wage ten thousand Scots for a year, which money is sent by the Bishop of Rome. There came three of the chief captains to Stirling, to the queen and the lords, on St Stephen's day at night \u2014 apparelled all in white satin, and told the queen and the council the cause of their coming. They showed her there was six thousand Frenchmen on the sea for Scotland, waiting a wind. As soon as the ten thousand Scots are mustered, and these six thousand are landed, then a post is to be sent to the French king, who had an army in readiness to land in England, and a fleet of ships is also promised by Denmark, but this not so certain.\" The letter concludes by advising his grace to grant power to the Lord of Cessford, to collect the rents Mernis, for two reasons. \" 1st, It will be most for the king's benefit. 2d, It will set Buccleuch and Cessford at variance, which were a good policy ; for although Buccleuch had taken assurance, yet he was playing a double part, assuring the queen and governor that he is yet a true Scotsman.\" ' 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 30th December, 1547.

By another letter from Lord Grey to the Protector, dated at Ber wick, June 17, 1548,2 it appears that the second arrival of auxiliaries, conducted by Monsieur D'Esse', must have been June 15th or 16th, 1548. This was the great force, including Suisses and Almains, as well as French. Lord Grey diminishes their number to twelve hundred men-at-arms, and eight hundred light horsemen ; but they were at the least six thousand strong, as is proved by a letter, State-paper Office, Lord Wharton to the Protector, dated 14th July, 1548. Letter K, page 418. Embarkation of the young Queen for France. Neither Keith, p. 55, nor Chalmers, p. 10, are able to fix the exact time of the young queen's sailing for France. A letter in the State paper Office, from Lord Grey to the protector, which is dated 4th August 1548, mentions, that he is informed the young queen is not yet transported, but lieth in a galley accompanied with other galleys, and four or five ships, a little from Dunbarton, where, he adds, she un doubtedly was yesterday, at twelve of the clock at noon. And he continues, \" the Lady Fleming, her mistress, making request to the captain of the galley, whose name is Villegaigno, to have her on land to repose her, because she hath been long on the sea ; He answered, she should not come on land, but rather go into France, or else drown by the way.\" Grey advises the protector to fit out some ships that way, with the hope of meeting her. In the Egerton Collection of MSS. No. 2, preserved in the British Museum, the contents of which are inaccessible to the public from the want of catalogues, there is a volume of transcripts, from original letters, during the reign of Henry the Second of France. My atten tion was directed to it by my learned friend Mr Holmes of the British Museum, who pointed out the following passages. In the first of them, Henry the Second, writing to Monsieur de Humyeres, the governor of his children, who were then brought up at the Palace of St Germain en-Laye, informs him (on the 27th July, 1548) that the little Queen of Scotland may soon be expected there, to be educated with the dauphin and his other children. \" Mais pour cela je ne veulx que vous bougez avec mes enfans, at- 1 MS.

The letter is dated 10th January, 1549. \" Mon Cousin. Pour ce que Paule de Rege present porteur est fort bien balladin, et a ce que j'en y peu coagnoistre honneste et bien con ditionne'e, j'ay advise de le donner a mons filz le Dauphin pour luy monster a bailer, et pareillment a ma fille la Royne d'Escosse et aux jeunes gentilhommes et damoiselles estant a leur service, et de mes autres enfans ; ' a ceste cause vous le presenterez a mon filz, et le ferez loger et manger avec ses autres officiers.'\" Letter L, page 419. Ferocity of the War. \"The war assumed a character of more than common ferocity.\" \u2014 In addition to what is mentioned in the text, this fact is strikingly illustra- ted by a paper2 entitled, \"Memorial [it should rather be scroll of a me- morial] for Edward Atkinson, alias Bluemantle, sent by the protector to the Governor of Scotland.\" This document states, that, after having obtained audience, the said Bluemantle, putting on his coat of arms, and making reverence unto him, (the governor,) without any other salutation, \"shall boldly say as ensueth : \" The substance is, that under- standing that sundry the king's majesty his grace's sovereign lord's sub jects and servants, born within the realm of Scotland, have now a good while, and yet do, according to their bounden duty, serve his majesty in these wars \u2014 the governor had published a proclamation, commanding, that if any Scotsman so serving, shall be taken in the field hearing arms against him, they shall not be used as prisoners but immediately put to death as rebels.\" Bluemantle is enjoined to demand this procla- mation to be immediately recalled, otherwise \" all Scottish prisoners, of whatever rank they be, shall be put to death as soon as they are taken.\" This paper is followed by a \" Minute of a Proclamation for not taking of Scottishmen,\" dated 22d May, 1549. It commences thus : \" Edward by the Grace of God, &c. * * Whereas the Earl of Arran, pretending himself to be Governor of Scotland,\" and goes on to speak of the people of Scotland not acknowledging, or giving obedience to \"their superior and sovereign lord the king's majesty of 2 MS.

Arrival of the Queen-dowager in France. The exact date of this princess's arrival in France, has not been given by any of our historians. In an original letter of Anne de Montmorency constable of France, to Mr de Bassefontaine, ambassador to the Queen of Hungary, (for the knowledge of which I am indebted to Mr Holmes of the British Museum,) there is the following notice of the arrival of the queen dowager in France. The letter is in the British Museum* additional MSS. 10,012, and is dated 27th September, 1550. \" Je vous advise que la Royne d'Escosse est puis trois ou quatre jours arrivee au Havre de Grace en bonne sante et tresbonne com pagnie ; elle fit hier son entree a Rouen. En dimanche prochain viendra trouver le Roy a l'Abbaye de bonnes nouvelles, ou il va de main coucher poure faire sa Feste St Michael ; apres que les seigneurs, l'aura venu et parle a elle, on vous sera entendre (ce que) sera requis sur les propos qui ont este entamez touchant la fait d'Escosse.\" Letter N, page 424. Sir John Masons Correspondence. Some interesting particulars, illustrating the intrigues of the queen dowager in France, a subject hitherto slightly passed over by our historians, may be derived from a volume in the State-paper Office, containing the correspondence of Sir John Mason, the English amhas-"], [489, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 453 sador at the court of France. Its authenticity is unquestionable, as it is Sir John's own Letter-book. We learn, by a letter from Mason to the privy council, dated Rouen, 6th October, (Correspondence, p. 118,) that he had that day visited the Queen-dowager of Scotland, who arrived there on the 25th of September, accompanied by a numerous train of Scottish gentlemen, and was received with much honour. On the 19th of the same month and year, (1550,) Mason addressed a letter to the privy council, dated Dieppe. He observes, that since their coming the principal of the Scots had visited him, except the Earl of Huntley and George Douglas. \" They lamented their estate, and showed why we [the English] had not our desire, [the king's marriage to Queen Mary,] which was ' the rude handling of them at all times, and especially in the notable slaughter made upon them at the great battle [Pinkie.]'\" He then continues, \"I gave ear unto them as unto Scots, and framed mine answers accordingly, and told them that they had refused that, that I did not doubt lfe, within a short time, they would wish they had taken \u2014 we sougft their own honour, profit, and commodity, which, forasmuch as they would not embrace, they were like to drink such as themselves had brewed, who had lively played the part of the horse that \u00c6sop, in his fables, telleth, sought the help of man against the hart. The Earl of Glencairn much complaineth of the detaining of his two sons, his father being dead, for whom they were pledges, but specially of the ill handling of them by the archbishop, who, he saith, kept them two years in his kitchen.\" I shall subjoin a few brief abstracts of some important letters, ad dressed by the same ambassador to the privy council. They throw considerable light on the relative politics of France, England, and Scotland, at this period. In a letter dated Blois, 4th December, 1650, he remarks, that \" the Scots bear a fell rout in this court, and be much made of, of all estates.\" He proceeds to say, that \" whatever differences of opinion they might have on other points, on one they all agreed, viz., that the English shall not have one foot of ground in Scotland peaceably, more than we had before the wars, but they will have the thanks for it all together, if we like, and not forego it by piecemeal. Ireland\" he adds, \" is ready to revolt and deliver themselves to a new master on a moment's warning.\" 1 In a subsequent letter dated Blois, 7th February, 1550-1, he states, that \"the blind Scot named the Bishop of Armagh, who had lately been in Ireland with commission to make a stir among the people, passed 1 Mason to the privy council, 4th December, 1550. Blois."], [490, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 484 five or six days ago by this court, and had been much made of;\" adding, \"he was departed to Rome.\" Again on the 23d February, 1550-1, writing to the council, he in forms them, that there were rumours of war secretly intended by France against England. England had refused a passport to the Master of Maxwell, at which the French king was much incensed, exclaiming, \" Vraiment, voyez ci une pauvre vengeance.\" \"There is in these men no love.\" \" The Queen of Scots and her house beareth in this court the whole swing. * * * The queen-dowager desireth the subversion of England, ' whose service in Scotland is so highly taken here, as she is in this court made a goddess.' These men, the French, are in great readiness for the wars.\" In a letter of the Lords of the privy council to Mason, dated at Greenwich the 28th of January, 1550, it appears that a spy had been sent, whom Balnaves the Scot recommended as proper to be trusted, and who would take care to bring the English ambassador as much intelligence as the Scots have.1 In Sir John Mason's answer to the privy council, dated Blois, 26th February, 1550-1, he informs them that this bearer arrived on the 24th February, but dared not tarry, as he found himself likely to be waylaid. He, however, had one who would fill his place, viz. the Lord Grange. \" I talked with him,\" says Mason, \" of the queen's departing, and of the men-of-war she was said to have with her.\" He said, \" this would not take any effect this year. He [Grange] promised to communicate every thing he could learn to the English ambassador, who, when he speaks of him, is to call him Corax.\" 2 By a letter of Mason to the privy council, 23d March, 1551, dated at Blois, it appears that the Vidame of Chartres was at that time in Edinburgh, on a mission from France. In another letter of the 18th April, 1551, from the same to the same, it is stated, that one George Paris had arrived from Ireland. \" He brags much,\" says Mason, \" associates with the Scots, and has offers from the Irish to league with France and throw off England. He hopes to have the dauphin shortly proclaimed King of Scotland and Ireland. It is said they are to have no open assistance from France, hut that the Queen of Scotland laboureth to have them holpen underhand by means of the Earl of Argyle and James Kennalt [Macconnell.]\" He goes on to observe, that \" John a Barton had arrived from Scotland at the French court, and brought word that the governor [Arran] had a great party in his favour to keep him in his place till they should have a king. This,\" he adds, \" was ill taken by the queen-dowager, who was 1 Mason, p. 250. Lords of privy council to Mason, Greenwich, 28th January, 1550. Ibid. p. 251. 8 Sir J.

Corax [Grange] thinks if the meeting of the commissioners for the borders goes on smoothly, all things will be quiet for this year.\" The Earl of Huntley had obtained one part of his suit from the Queen of Scots, which was, that when she came of age, he should have the earldom of Moray. \" This king [the King of France] hath bound himself by writing thereunto, but the custody of the bond is to be in the hands of the dowager. All the Scots are against him in this, especially Sutherland and Cassillis. It will breed a great stab amongst them.\" \u2014 \" The queen is all for herself and for a few other friends, whose partiality, showed more to some than others, maketh a great heartburning. Lord Maxwell at his departing had a chain of five hundred crowns ; Drumlanrick had nothing, and used rude speech to the queen. \" The Scottish queen's shipping is hasted very much. It is thought she shall embark a month sooner than she intended. The Lady Flem ing departed hence, with child by this king ; ' and it is thought that, immediately upon the arrival of the dowager in Scotland, she will come again to fetch another. If she so do, here is like to be a combat, being the heartburning already very great ; the old worn pelf2 fearing thereby to lose some part of her credit, who presently reigneth alone, and governeth without empeasche.\" We learn something of the French intrigues in Ireland by a letter of Mason to the privy council, dated at Amboise, 22d April, 1551. He states, \" that a gentleman who had come from Ireland with George Paris, was named Cormac Ochonor, eldest of nine brothers who are alive. He braggeth his father hath been the great worker of all this rebellion ; he never would submit to England, although he hath a house within a stone's cast of the English pale. Last Saturday he ex hibited to the constable a paper, showing what force, both horse and foot, his father could bring into the field ; asked for prompt assistance, as it was by the French intrigues this rebellion had wholly been stirred up. He begged for five thousand men at the French king's charges. He was paid with fair words. The Dowager of Scotland would fain have them holpen, and I am assuredly informed the Vidame is nothing behind them, who, since his coming hither, hath been very highly and friendly entertained by the king. He hath had many secret conferences with the king, the dowager, and the constable.\" 1 This was, I suspect, the Dowager Lady Fleming, a daughter of James IV. by the Countess of Bothwell.

By another letter, dated 27th April, 1551, it appears \"that the Scottish queen's departure * * * * was again delayed, and some thought the occasion thereof was some fancy the French king hath to some of her train.\" 1 In his next letter, 29th April, 1551, at Amboise, Sir John Mason informed the English privy council, that he had made diligent search as to the news brought by a post from Scotland. \" I have learned,\" says he, \" that there is come to light a practice (or at the least a great suspicion thereof) for the poisoning of the young queen. He that took the matter upon him is an archer of the Guard, who is escaped into Ireland. There is as much diligence made as can be devised for the getting of him from thence ; and, as they say here, he is already stayed to be sent back again to Scotland, and so into France. The old queen is fallen suddenly sick upon the opening of this news unto her. By whose means this thing should principally be moved, I cannot yet understand, but it is thought that it was devised by some miscontented Scots. This is told me for a great secrecy ; whether it be true or not your lordships may know farther with time. * * The said post hath brought word, that the Lady Fleming is brought to bed of a man child, whereat our women do not much rejoice.\" 2 On the 10th of May, 1551, Sir John Mason, writing from court to the English privy council, observes, \" There hath been lately a great consultation touching the marriage of the dauphin to the Scottish queen, which the constable and the chancellor would in any case to be deferred.\" \" The dowager of Scotland maketh all at this court weary, from the high to the low \u2014 such an importunate beggar is she for herself. The king would fain be rid of her, and she as she pre tendeth would fain be gone. Marry, the hucking is about many mat ters, the king being desirous she should depart upon promise of the sending thereof to her, and she desiring to have the same with her. The sums are two hundred thousand francs of old debts, which is in a manner all paid ; and besides that, fifty thousand francs more, partly for the payment of other pensions accorded among the Scots, and partly to remain at her disposition as she shall see cause, and fifty thousand for her own pension for that year. Talking yesterday with the Re ceiver-general of Bretagne, of Scottish matters, he told me \u2014 wishing that Scotland were in a fish-pool \u2014 that out of his receipt and of the receipt of Guienne, there had been sent thither, since the beginning of the wars, nineteen hundred thousand francs : how much had passed 1 Mason to the privy council, 27th April, 1551, Amboise. 2 Ibid. p. 309, May 10, 1551.\u2014 From court."], [493, "NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 487 otherwise he knew not,\" (p. 312.) On the 19th May, Mason alludes to the French intrigues in Ireland. * * \" I saw,\" says he, \" yesterday, a letter sent from Rome to an Italian in this court, wherein was written, that the Bishop of Armachan, as he calleth himself, which is the blind Scot that lately passed this way, is thoroughly and very well despatched touching the matters of Ireland.\" It appears by a sub sequent letter of June 11th, that the \"blind Scot,\" the Bishop of Armagh, had departed with his despatch towards Ireland. The last letter in this valuable volume of Sir John Mason's Correspondence, is darted July 20, 1551. Sir William Pickering, and soon after him Sir Nicholas Wotton, succeeded Mason as ambassadors at the French court, and their let ters, which are preserved in the French Correspondence of the State paper Office, vol. vi., contain many interesting illustrations, not only of the politics of France and England, but of the condition of Scotland and of Ireland during the last years of Edward and the commencement of the reign of Mary. Indeed, I might rather say, they illustrate the history of Europe ; for it was the business of the English ambassador at the court of France, to have his agents or spies in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands, and to transmit to the sovereign, the prime minister, and the privy council of England, reports of all the information which he received. Mary of Guise's interview with Edward the Sixth took place on the 4th of November, 1551, and she appears to have returned to Scotland about the 24th of the same month, as, in the books of the Lord High treasurer of Scotland, under the date 21st November, 1551, we find an order directed to Sir Andrew Ker of Littledean, directing him to send letters of proclamation to Jedburgh, Selkirk, Dunse, &c, charg ing the lords, lairds, and other gentlemen, to meet the queen at our Lady Kirk of Steil, in their most honest manner, on the 24th No vember. In a letter dated September 19, 1552, preserved in the French Cor respondence, we find a paper, entitled \" Secret Information of Thomas Stukely,\" which details \" a plan of the French king for the conquest of England.\" \u2014 First, he would order that the Scots should enter into Northumberland with all their power ; then he himself would come to Falmouth, and the Duke of Guise with another army to land at Dartmouth. He would proclaim and restore the old mass, putting the people to their full liberty as he doth in Scotland. In a letter from Sir N. Wotton to the privy council, dated at Me lun, 28th December, 1553, he informs them, that the report of the Queen of England's marriage with the Prince of Spain made the French begin to speak of war with England ; and he adds, that the"], [494, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 488 French king had already despatched Monsieur D'Osell with the same commission that he had on his former mission, and that he meant to send after him the Vidame of Chartres with a certain number of soldiers. We find by a letter of Wotton's to the council, Melun, January 9, 1553-4, that the Queen of Scots now kept her table and lodging apart, to show that she had come to her years to have the whole rule in her own hands. I shall conclude these short notices of the valuable matter which may be found in the French Correspondence of the State-paper Office, by the following letter of Wotton to the Lord Paget, privy-seal, and Sir William Petre, knight, principal secretary. It is dated 1st March, 1556-7, and is written wholly in cipher, but fortunately the contem porary decipher accompanies it. \" My duty remembered to your honours. I have heretofore certi fied the queen's majesty, what good will this bearer, Kirkaudrie [Kir kaldy,] seemed to bear to her majesty, and to the realm of England, and how little he is contented with the present state of Scotland, and how desirous he is to see it delivered from the yoke of the Frenchmen, and restored to their former liberty ; and also what offers he hath divers times made to serve the queen's majesty the best he could. Whereupon, although I have had no answer, yet forasmuch as he re turneth now into Scotland, and thereby hath occasion to pass through England, I advised him to do that thing which I perceived he was before of himself minded to do, that is to say, to visit you by the way : thereby you may, by communication with him, the better understand his mind ; * * and, in case you like him, appoint him how he is to serve. Marry, this he earnestly requireth, that in case the queen's highness shall think him meet to do her majesty's service, that yet, nevertheless, his matters may pass only through your hands, for he feareth greatly that, all the council being privy to it, it were not easy to be kept secret, thereby he should stand in danger of his life. \" Now, in case you should ask me what I think of him, first I must say, that I have had no acquaintance with him, but sith my coming hither. Marry, by the communication I have had with him now and then, here, either he must be a very great and crafty dissembler, or else he beareth no good will at all to the Frenchmen, and next unto his own country he beareth a good mind to England. \" Marry, what service he shall be able to do now, he intending to continue in Scotland, your wisdoms can better consider than I.

He calls the primate Amulthon (Hamil ton,) and declares, that after his case (a kind of periodic asthma) had defied the skill of the physicians of the emperor, and the French king, he made the bishop smack whole in twenty-four hours. \" Intra xxiv. horas nullo vel plane levi remedio liberabatur.\" He came to Edin burgh on the 3d of June, and remained till the 13th of September. He returned to Italy, January, 1623. VOL. IV. 2 I"], [496, "490 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. His mode of cure, as described by Randolph in the following extract from one of his letters to Cecil,1 was not quite so simple as Cardan himself would have us believe. He sinks the \"young whelps, a hanging the poor prelate by the heels.\" \" I will be bold,\" says Randolph, \" to trouble your honour a little with a merry tale : Cardanus the Italian, took upon him the cure of the Bishop of St Andrews, in a disease that, to all other men, was judged desperate and incurable. He practised upon him divers foreign inventions : he hung him certain hours in the day by the heels, to cause him to avoid at the mouth that the other ways nature could not expel : he fed him many days with young whelps : he used him some times with extreme heats, and as many days with extreme colds. Before his departure, he roundeth, for the spaee of six days, every day, certain unknown words in his ears, and never used other medi cine after. It is said that at that time he did put a devil within him, for that since that he hath been ever the better, and that this devil was given him on credit but for nine years ; so that now the time is near expired, that either he must go to hell with his devil, or fall again into his old mischief, to poison the whole country with his false practices.\" 1 MS.
