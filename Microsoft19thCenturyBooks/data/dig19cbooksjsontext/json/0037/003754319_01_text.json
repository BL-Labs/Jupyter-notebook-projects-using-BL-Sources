The wildly romantie legend of \" Vanderdecken ; on. The Flying Dutchman,\" has been an imitating theme for more than one novelist, and inasmuch as the story was one which, with its many accessories, could Le treated in a variety of fashions, there existed no objections to its plot, so far as regarded the fate of Vanderdecken himself, being the ground work of more than one entertaining and instructive superstructure. It has been the aim of the author of the following tale to steer clear of his predecessors who have made use of the legend, and by taking fresh ground and diving, as it were, into the domestic life of the merchant princes of Amsterdam, he has attempted what those who have gone before him probably wanted the personal experience to do. How far he has succeeded in painting vivid and life-like scenes to the imagination, the extraordinary sale of this work, published in a periodical form, affords a tolerable assurance. To the daily and weekly press, for the favourable notices of the work, the author begs to express his obligations, and then in its com plcted form to lay the romance before his best patrons, the reading public.

A sail !\" screamed a voice That voice was well known in tht ship. It belonged to a boy who was the nephew of the captain, and all eyes were eagerly turned to windward, witl the hope of seeing the vessel. Tlie captain put his speaking-trumpet to his mouth, and call out to the lad\u2014 \" Harry ! Where is she ?\" The answer of the boy was drowned in a roaring gust of wind, but he waited until tbat was over, and in the temporary lull before the wild element came again in all its might, he shouted out in his shrill treble \u2014 \" On the weather-bow, sir, with every inch of canvas set 1\" Before the captain could attempt the utterance of a word of incredulity of such a statement \u2014 for well he knew that for any ship to carry sail in such a gale, involved au impossibilty \u2014 the clouds broke in the east, and a strange yellow light burst over the ocean. One shout arose from every lip, as, not three cables' length from the Helena, was seen a CHAPTER I. THE PHANTOM SHIP. It was one hour past midnight, on the last day of February, in the year 1808, that the English ship Helena, bound for the Mauritius, encountered a gale off the Cape of Good Hope, that threatened destruction to the noble vessel, and to every soul on board. Dense black clouds, looking like funeral palls, spread across the entire sky. The crests of the waves shed a wild phosphorescent light upon the sails and cordage of the Helena, and the wind roared and shrieked among the shrouds, as though it were loaded with invisible demons, who were rejoicing in the pos sible destruction of the gallant ship. Every rag of canvas had been scattered to skreads, for the storm had been so sudden, as the western bluff of the Africa coast was weathered, that there had been no time to adopt any means of precaution. All tbat the captain could do, was to lash himself to the helm, and keep the ship's head to seaward as much as possible, while the tempest each moment increased in intensity. Above the roar of the gale, and the astounding lashing of the waves, might occasionally be heard the hoarse cries of the captain, as he would place the speaking-trumpet that hung round his neck to his lips, and give some orders to the crew, for the greater safety of the ressel. There was a lull for a moment. The ship rolled heavily in the trough of the sea. '''Batten down the fore-hatch now, my men!\" cried the mate. \"Cheerily there ! \" Hold on for life!\" roared the captain. \" It's coming again.\" The words had scarcely left his lips, when the ship lurched over to larboard frightfully, and every soul on board that fated vessel thought that their last hour aad come ; but she righted again, and then, but not till then, they began to Snd what the storm really was, and what t was capable of, in the hour of its wildest fury. Every portable article upon the deck iras whirled away in the air, as though ;hey had been mere straws. The lar .oard bulwatks were stove in as though ;h\u00bby had been so much paper, and the"], [13, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 3 large ship coming full towards them, with every stitch of canvas she could carry set to the breeze. It was awful to see it. \" No \u2014 no, a delusion. Did you, or did you not, Wilson, see a large square- rigged vessel in full sail, crowded with canvas, bearing down upon us in the midst of the storm, while, if we had hoisted only an inch of canvas, it would have gone to ribbons like a piece of old bunting jj?\" I \" Yes, I saw it, and so did the whole ship's crew. Hilloa, my lads ! Who saw the strange craft that was going to run into us, and then went off like a wreath of smoke from the cook's galley P* \" All\u2014 all !\" cried the crew \"And what was it, my heaities ?\" \"The Flying Dutchman!\" was the cry from every throat. : The captain turned pale. \"Where is the boy?\" he said. \"Where is Frank?\" \" Here I am, uncle.\" \" Keep by me, Frank. I think that this is the last voyage that any of us will make in the Helena.\" | \" Land ho !\" cried a man, who was on the look-out. Captain Franklin sprang on to the nettings, and with his glass, took a long I look. I \" Yes,\" he said. \" There's the Table Mountain. We are nearer the Cape than I thought we were, and in our crippled state it will be madness to : attempt to gain the Mauritius. We | must get into Table Bay as well as we can. Wilson, get up a jerry-mast, and make all our deck as ship-shape as pos 1 sible. I will be up again soon.\" \" Don't you hurry, sir,\" said the mate. \" There's lots of younger men I than you are, sir, to get the ship in order again. This night has been almost ' too much for you, sir. You go down and turn in for a few hours, and leave the deck to me ; and when you come up again you won't know it, sir.\" \" Very well, Wilson ; get her into the bay if you can. Give the men an extra ration of grog. I will rest if I can, but \" \" Helena alee !\" shouted the mate. \"She'll run us down.\" \" No !\" shrieked the captain. \" No ! Oh, God, help us now ! It is the Phan tom Ship !\" I As the words came from his lips, tbe stately vessel, with all its sails set, shrivelled up and disappeared like a burnt scroll, as it were, within twenty yards of the bow of the Helena, and then, as if at the fiat of some one mighter than the winds and the waves, the storm dropped. The dense clouds opened, and let the soft light of the dawn fall upon the deep. The waves hid their crested : heads. The gale no longer roared ! through the wreck of the Helena's masts, \u2022 and, save the seething wash of the sea's surface, there was but little left to j point to the fact that such a strife of the elements in their maddest hour had taken place. \"God, it's over now!\" cried the captain. \" Clear the wreck, my lads, j Cut away every thing. To ;work \u2014 to work!\" The sailors gave three loud cheers, ' and then, animated by the idea that the storm was over, they commenced with alacrity ridding the ship of the dragging mass of sails and cordage that hung over her sides into the water. As soon as that was done, she righted. The carpenter reported all sound below ; and although the Helena was little better than a sheer hulk, she yet obeyed the J helm, and rode the surface of the sea bravely. \"We are saved, indeed,\" said the captain, as the mate came towards him, ' pressing the sea weeds from his hair. \" We are saved.\" \"Why, yes, sir, I take it as we is; but it was a close touch that, sir, rather. I booked us all for Davey Jones's locker.\" The captain took the rough seaman by the collar, and placing his lips close to his ear, he said \u2014 \"Did you see it?\" \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir.\" \"Upon your oath, Wilson, you do not think it was a delusion ?\" \"But what, sir?\" \" My heart misgives me, Wilson. The Phantom Ship don't appear for nothing. Well\u2014 well, we shall see. We shall see.\" \"Ah!\" said Wilson, when the old captain had gone below. \" We shall see. \" A collusion, sir ?\""], [14, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 4 this coast, where there is almost always a wild sort of sea running.\" \"No\u2014 noJ.\" said Captain Franklin,. as these words reached his ears. \" No, my gallant shipmates, do not say that. I can face storms, as I have faced many. Let the wind blow its worst, and let the salt sea lash the bark. I can laugh at its fury ; but when we see sights that are more than human, we may well be affected, and shrink before them. Where s Frank ?\" If the Helena makes a port, why, I'm a Dutchman, that's all. But we will try. The Phantom Ship is a pretty sure sign, that it's all up with the Helena ; but it won't do to discourage the men, or we might as well all go down plump to gether at once. Now, my mates, cheerily to work, and we will scon put the old \u2022hip in her shape again.\" _ A loud shriek from the captains cabin at this moment struck upon the ears of the ship's crew, and they all started up from their various employ ments, and looked at each other in dis may. \" What's that ?\" cried the mate. \" Here I am, uncle,\" cried the boy. \" What sights !\u2014 what sights !\" cried the crew. \" We can't work the ship if there's anything wrong in her. What is it ?\" \" Look to the helm, you lubbers !\" said the mate. \" Do you mean tn let the old Helena float at the mercy of the winds and the waves ? To your duty, men ! \u2014 to your duty 1\" The seamen had, as with one accord, crowded round their captain ; but now, somewhat abashed at the reproof of the mate, they shrank back to their stations. \" I must tell you all,\" said Captain Franklin. \" I have said enough to excite. curiosity, and I must satisfy it, now.\" \"No, sir, say nothing,\" interposed the mate. \" They are quite inclined to be frightened enough, as it is. There ain't a greater superstitious animal than a sailor, sir, in all the world. Don't tell 'em anything, captain. Don't, I beg, sir.\" \" It will be worse,\" said the captain, \" to leave it to their imaginations, and, besides, it must be told. There is a stranger in my cabin.\" \" A stranger !\" cried every voice. \" Hush ! belay, there !\" cried Wilson, the mate. \" If we are to hear it, let's have all the ins and outs of it in a judg matical way. Silence, all of you, and let the captain speak.\" You might have heard a pin drop on board of the Helena at that moment. The man at the helm grasped the wheel with both hands, but his head was in clined towards the captain, who, holding on by a gun carriage, with his face as. pale as death, and his gray hair dancing in the light wind, that only now swept softly over the ship, thus spoke, \u2014 '* You know, shipmates, that I had been at the wheel for the whole of the passage of the gale over ov fated ship : \"Help! help!\" shouted Captain Franklin, and ce rushed upon deck, more like a madman than a human being. Terror was in every feature of his face, and as the early morning light fell upon his eyes, they seemed starting from their sockets. \"Help! Oh, help! Mercy ! I knew it would come to some thing\"! The cabin\u2014 the cabin ! The Phantom Ship ! We are doomed ! Doomed are all of us, and the good vessel that has stood between us and the waves, will never mere see her port ! The storm was not the work of Heaven ! Fiends raised it from the bosom of the deep, and now they are on board us. Help\u2014 help ! Oh, help ! God save us all!\" He fell heavily upon the deck of Ihe vessel, before any of his panic-stricken man could interfere to save him, for they all seemed as though they were turned to stone, as they heard their captain wildly utter such a strange and frantic speech. 1 he mate first recovered sufficiently to lift Captain Franklin to his feet, and to cry out\u2014 \" What is the meaning of all this ? Oh, sir, say what it is that has so terrified you. Speak to us now. The sea is getting as smooth as glass, and there's not wind enough to ruffle the curls on a girl's cheek. The old craft, sir, is yet stout and strong.\" \"Where is he, now?\" said the cap tain, faintly. *' Who \u2014 who ?\" cried everybody. \" It's the storm,\" said an old sailor ; \" it's the storm that has been too much for him.

Who and what he is, or how he came there, I know not, hut there he is. Only a faint light came in by the one open window that I un locked, as the spray did not reach it now, and there I saw him sitting on a bulk bead, and looking as I never saw mortal man look. \u2014 I cannot go into that cabin again.\" The captain shuddered, and leant heavily upon the arm of Wilson for sup port. He was evidently deeply affected. The crew looked aghast at this informa tion, and Wilson called out,\u2014 \" If there's any one in the captain's cabin, let's have him out of it at once.\" \" I'll go and see,\" said the boy Frank. \"No! \u2014 oh, no!\" cried the captain. \" You must not, Frauk. Do not let him go, I beg of you. I promised his widowed mother that I would be careful of him. Do not let him go.\" \"Never fear for me, captain. I haven't ploughed the salt sea, man and boy, for forty years, to be afraid at a trifle, and if it were the devil himself, or even the Flying Dutchman, Vanderdecken \" A shout of surprise and terror arose from the crew, as at this moment a tall dark figure rose up from the hatchway leading to the captain's cabin. CHAPTER II, THE SPIKIT IN THE BOAT. The ship's company of the Helena might well be excused for regarding the personage who ascended to the deck from the captain's cabin with a fearful and absorbing interest. In person, ne was thin to emaciation. He was rather above the middle height, and his face and hands were of a deathly paleness. He wore a sort of plum coloured suit of apparel, open at the knees, and then laced with a rusty silken cord. The sleeves of his jacket or doublet were long and slashed. His hose was of a dusky brown, with large stripes up the sides, and his shoes were adorned with massive silver buckles \u2014 on his head he wore a three-cornered hat, and a mass of jet black hair de scended on to his shoulders \u2014 a broad black belt was round his waist, to which hung a canvas bag. Weapons he had none \u2014 at least, none were visible. Such was the figure that with a slow and stately step came up from the cap tain's cabin of the Helena and faced the \" Hold hard, Master Frank !\" cried Wilson. \"This is no boy's business. Let me go. I am not afraid of man nor devil !\" \"But I'm not a boy,\" said Frank. \"I was fifteen, last Christmas, and you have no right to call me a boy, Wilson ; and I'm not afraid of fifty men, or fifty devils !\" \"Let's all go!\" cried one of the crew. \" What !\" said Wilson, \" all the ship's company go together to the cap tain's cabin, because there is some one there that ought not to be ? That don't look English-like, I take it; and, besides, how many of you are to get down the hatchway at once, you lubbers, eh ?\" The crew drew back. crew. There can be no doubt but that up to that moment, notwithstanding the pro verbial superstition of sailors and their strong disposition to credit anything of the marvellous that they possibly could, they had all considered that the cap tain's account of having seen some one in his cabin was but the result of an over-wrought brain, and hence when such a figure did really appear before tbem, consternation and terror sat upon every face. \u2022 \" Avast, all of you,\" added Wilson. \"What manner of man was he, cap tain?\" \" Pale and sad, and dressed in an ancient suit of faded brown, trimmed with rusty lace. Oh. Wilson, do not go. I beg of you to be careful of yourself, for if I fail, and I feel tnat I am sailing fast, what is to become of the old Helena, if you are not up to the point i\" \" 'Tis he \u2014 'lis he !\" cried the captain, and he fainted and fell upon the deck. The crew all shrank back to the farther end of the vessel, excepting"], [16, "6 VANDERDECKEN; OR, Wilson and Frank ; and the strange figure bent its gaze upon them with such a \"look of calm despair, that the boy was touched by it, and found strength to say \u2014 Hush 1 Indeed, there is nothing to fear now.\" \" Then, he is gone ?\" sighed the cap tain. \" Alas !\" said the stranger, holding up both his hands ; \" what have I done that I should awaken such terror in the heart of a brave man ? What have I done that I should be shrunk from with horror P The wild waves have spared me, and will man reject me ?\" The captain's eyes fell upon the figure of the stranger guest, and with frantic vehemence, he cried,\u2014 \" Away with him ! Overboard with him ! He is not of this world ! Away with him, I say ! Look into his eyes ! They have not the light of life in them ! We are doomed while he is with us !\" \" Who are you ? Where do yon come from ? ' \"Ah!\" cried Wilson, in a voice hoarse with contending feelings. J \" Who are you, and where do you come from ?\" The figure advanced a step or two. \" Keep back !\" cried the boy, as he strove to drag the insensible form of his uncle out of reach of the extraordinary appearance. \" Keep back : you have no business here !\" In a soft, melancholy voice, the deep cadences of which were irresistibly at tractive, the figure spoke \u2014 \"Kind and gentle friends,\" it said. \" Is there no pure humanity in all your souls ? Can you have no pity for a ship wrecked man, who is thrown upon your mercy ? \u2014 Oh, be gentle \u25a0 and kind to one whom fate has thrown into your hands. Am 1 so wild and terrible that you should all shrink from me ? Ah, no\u2014 ah, no!\" \" Oh, this is sad !\" said the stranger. \" This is sad, indeed ! and in a Christian vessel. I ask of you nothing but what you all freely ask for, and freely get, if your ship had been wrecked. There were many mortal souls, but they all perished. I only wish a passage in your gallant bark to your port, after you leave this part of the world.\" \" No\u2014 no !\" cried the crew. \"No !\" That \" Ah, no !\" was so exquisitely musical, that it lingered upon the air like the memory of some half- forgotten tune- Frank looked at Wilson, and Wilson looked at Frank. Fear was subsiding into wonder, and then the boy said\u2014 \" But how came you here ?\u2014 and who are you ?\" \"My ship,\" said the stranger, as he waived his arm. \" My ship went down in the storm. I can perceive that it has not left you scathless ; but I am a bold swimmer, and I made my way through the surging waters. I clutched the stern-galley of your vessel, and made my way into the cabin amid the strife and fury of the elements. I am a ship wrecked man, and ship-saved, likewise. Will you pity me ?\" Again the last words that came from the lips of the mysterious stranger soun ded like the wail of some distant music. As this brief conference had proceeded, the crew had crept closer and closer to the spot upon which it was taking place, and the captain, too, showed signs of consciousness. \" Sad again !\" said the stranger. \" Look, my noble comrades of the ocean ! I lhave gold that will pay you well for my passage ; and I am still and inoffen sive. Behold !\" He poured out of the little canvas bag that was attached to his waist a number of pieces of money ; but they were all so black with age and tarnish, that it was quite impossible to say what metal they were made of. One of them dropped upon the deck at his feet. \" You all of you see,\" he said, \"that I can pay. These are broad gold pieces, and will satisfy you. Take them all, so that you earry me to Europe, and land me at \u2014 at \" \" Amsterdam ?\" cried a sailor. \"Yes,\" said the stranger, \"at Am sterdam,\" and as he spoke the word there was the same soft musical cadence in his voice that had been so striking be fore as he had addressed Frank and Wilson. \" I knew it,\" added the sailor, step ping forward, \" I knew it.\" \" You knew what ?\" said Wilson. \"That he wants to go to Amsterdam. Look at him\u2014 look at his clothes, and \" Hush ! \u2014 hush ! \" cried Frank. \" There is nothing to fear. Look up !"], [17, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 7 the tarnished lace, messmates.

Only to Amsterdam \u2014 to the port of Amsterdam. You all understand me ? I will enrich every man in the ship. There is more gold \u2014 gold in heaps, to be got. But, oh ! if you have Christian souls and hearts, take me to Amsterdam !\" The shouts of the sailors now assumed the most threatening aspect, and cries of \" Vanderdecken ! It is Vanderdecken 1\" \"Down with him!\" \"Into the sea!\" \" Slay him!\" were shouted in every pos sible variety of intonation. \" You hear, bad spirit,\" cried Captain Franklin vehemently. \" You hear that this is no place for you. Each moment, my men, that he remains on board our vessel, she settles in the water. Yonder is Table Bay. If we would reach it, he must be got rid of. He is the Jonah, I tell you, who will be our destruction else.\" The stranger smiled faintly. \" Vanderdecken ! Vanderdecken !\" cried the crew. \"Nay, my noble messmates,\" said the stranger, \"you give too much way to idle superstition. Look at this gold. Will not a hundred of such broad pieces pay you well for the passage of one man ?\" \" 'Tis he !\" shouted Captain Franklin. \" 'Tis Vanderdecken, the captain of the Fljing Dutchman, and he will prove a Jonah to our ship. We will not take him for all his gold. He knows well that we were bound for the Mauritius, from there to take ivory to Amsterdam, and he would secure a passage with us. If Vanderdecken can once get a passage in a Christian vessel to Amsterdam, which is his port, he will get rid of the curse that clings to him.\" \" Alas 1 alas !\" said the stranger. \" He admits it !\" cried the captain. \" Away with him ! Cast him over board, my men : we will not have him in the ship. No vessel can live that has him on board. We will not have his gold !\" With yells, and cries of rage, and with the feelings of men who were about to make an effort for their lives, the sailors seized upon various weapons, and in a threatening mass advanced. \" What would you ?\" said the stranger. \" Here is a ship, there is the sky, and below is the sea. Where would you that T should go ?\" \" Over \u2014 over, with you !\" they shouted. \"We won't have you here. Overboard with you, at once !

I don't want"], [18, "8 * A.SD___,_ttUJi,-.ll.___,lN. \"Cast off!\" cried Wilson; and the boat was alone upon the water. The ship was soon some twenty feet from it, and then they saw the stranger stand up in it, and clasping his hands above his head, he cried, in a wailing voice,\u2014 \"A passage to Amsterdam! \u2014 a pas sage to Amsterdam ! Will no Christian ship take a benighted soul to Amster dam ?\" There was then one loud shriek, and boat and stranger both in one instant dis appeared below the surface of the sea ! A shudder pervaded the crew of the Helena, and each one looked in his neigh bour's face, as though there he hoped to gather some courage that he felt not himself. to keep him in the ship more than any of you. He may be what you say. He, perhaps, is Venderdecken ; but that's no reason why we should do a dastardly thing. If you will make him leave the ship \u2014 \" He shall\u2014 he shall !\" yelled twenty voices. \"Well then, the sea is calm, and Table Bay is only some eight or nine knots ahead of us. Give him, or lend him rather, a boat, and let him go ; but, boy as I am, I won't see any one, if he were ten times Vanderdecken the Flying Dutchman, cut down like a pirate, or thrown into the sea like a rotten plank.

There can't be no harm in an old gold coin.\" \"If there's any good,\" said one of the sailors, who had been most violent in denouncing the stranger passenger, '\u2022here is another of them that he dropped upon the deck.\" The revulsion of feeling in favour of the proposition of Frank, was immediate. A roaring cheer burst from the sailors, and then there was a loud shout of \u2014 \"A boat \u2014 a boat! Give him a boat !\" The storm had carried away all the boats but one very small one that hung at the stern, and that had received some damage. Nevertheless, it was speedily let into the water, with its oars lying athwart its planks, and then there was a general cry of \" Away with him \u2014 away with Vanderdecken ! '' The figure slowly moved to the side of the vessel, and then turning and smil ing very sweetly, while a gentle look came across the whole face, he said\u2014 \"Frank Wilding.\" \"That's me,\" said Frank. \"He knows my name pat enough, though it has not been mentioned.\" As he spoke, the sailor stooped to pick up the piece of gold that had dropped through the fingers of the mysterious stranger when he showed his money from the canvas bag. The sailor no sooner got that piece of gold in his hand, than he gave such a loaringcry, that he startled everybody in the ship, and every one crowded round him. \" Frank Wilding, take this piece of gold. Nay, boy, do not shrink. I do not give it to you as money. Keep it ever about you as )ou follow your pro fession on the sea ; and while it is with you, the waves may boil and bubble around you, and the wild winds may do their worst \u2014 the gaping planks of the best and bravest ship that ever stemmed the sea, may part beneath your feet, but you shall not go down.

Then lightly mounting oyer the side of the vessel, he dropped into the little boat. \"Help! \u2014 fire ! \u2014 murder!\" he shouted. \" Oh\u2014 oh\u2014 oh I\" \"What's the matter?\" cried every body, in a breath. The piece of money had gone, festering and hissing like a red-hot ball, right through his hands, and falling upon the deck, it still burnt its way righton through the planking into the cabin below, through its floor again, and soon was right through the ship, until, with a hissing noise, it reached the sea.

CONDUCTS THE HEADER TO AMSTERDAM. Leaving now the good ship, or rather the once good ship Helena, for it could hardly lay claim to that title now, to get out, of its difficulties as best it may, we beg the reader's company to the ancient city of Amsterdam. It is the summer time of the year, so that everything in and about the old city wears its most smiling aspect. The trees are in full leaf, and from every balcony in the old place the gorgeous tulip shakes its flaunting head. There is in and about the whole place an air of sleepy content ment, as though all the inhabitants of Amsterdam bad had quite enough of the world, and were intent upon a long rest by the shores of the placid canals and dykes of the city. But if, as a general thing, the good city of Amsterdam was in a state of general quietude, there was one house that upon this special occasion was an exception to the general rule. That house belonged to Mynheer Von Straken, and from the interior of it came ali sorts of sounds, indicating that some thing of a very remarkable character was going on within it. The strains of an old cracked violb, accompanied by the din of some wind instrument, were plainly to be heard ; and now and then, too, a loud peal of laughter would break upon the startled ears of the inhabitants of the street. Von Straken himself was sitting in a corner of the room smoking a prodigious pipe, the volumes of smoke from which curled up to the ceiling, and there formed a dense cloud. He was so much amused at the fall of the couple that had been dancing, that he actually took the pipe out of his mouth for a moment, and said\u2014 \" Ah !\" \" Up\u2014 up !\" cried a young man, who was present ; \" why don't you get up ? We will have another dance.\" The young lady who had fallen, was got to her feet, and when she faced the light a prettier pair of eyes and rosier cheeks could not have been seen than those that belonged to the young Whilel mina Straken \u2014 for it was no less a per son than the daughter of Von Straken himself who had fallen upon the slippery floor.\u2014 Did we say fallen ? Alas ! had she not been pulled down by the clumsiness of her partner ? To be sure she had. \"I won't dance with him any more/' said Whilelmina, pouting as she crossed the room. \"I won't dance with him again ; and, what is more, I won't have him at all now.\" We will enter that house and see what Mynheer Von Straken can be about to produce such a riot in tbe ship-crowded quarter of Amsterdam in which he re sided. \" What do I hear ?\" cried Von Straken. \" Mine child, what do I hear ? You won't have the great Simpson and Co.? Oh-oh! Ha!\" \"No, father. Why should I have him ? You know that there is young Von Strogokiff who loves me ; and then there is Von Durgmenter, and I don't know how many othere ; but nothing will satisfy you but my marrying the Englishman, and he's so \u2014 so \u25a0\" \"' So what ?\" cried everybody. In a large apartment upon the ground floor, an extensive party was assembled. These were the Von Strakcns for no less than three generations\u2014 that is to say, in some degree, for an old lady of ninety two years of age was the representative of the first generation, and a chubby little girl was the representative of the last. No. 2."], [20, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 10 the prettiest girl I ever saw. There's Jane Williams, of 29, Barbican\u2014 she is ready to eat me up ; and then, there s Matilda Batters, in Aldersgate Street \u2014 Lord bless you ! she would if she could, only the parish won't allow it, take up the paving-stones that I walk on, and have 'em in bed with her \u2014 Oh, she is so fond of me ! But I will say it, if it were the last word I had to say in the world, and if I'm obliged to go out of business to-morrow, that you are the prettiest girl I ever saw in all my life.\" \" But you ought not to fall down,\" said Whilelmina. \"Mine dear childer,\" said old Stra ken. \"Mine peautiful childer, kiss and be friends. Ha 1\" \" Thin !\" said Whilelmina, and she burst into tears. By this time, the author of the dis- aster of the fall had, after a number of ineffectual efforts, scrambled to his feet, and got rid of the wooden shoes with which he had been accommodated to dance the national figure which had ended in his sudden downfall. He was a slim young man, with rather a profusion of light hair, and the undoubted representa- tive of the house of Simpson and Com- pany of London, who traded with Am- sterdam, and whose agent in all business transactions in that capital was the highly respectable Mynheer Von Straken. '\"Well,\" he said, \"upon my life, I haven't had such a downer as that since I don't know when. I tell you 'what it is, Mr. Straken \u2014 you ought to do some thing to this floor to take the polish off. Why, one might as well try to dance on the top of father's mahogany table.\" \" Take the polish off, my son ?\" said old Straken. \"Oh\u2014 oh \u2014 oh! He wants the polish off the floor.\" \" I won't,\" said Whilelemina. \"Oh, yes, you will,\" sighed Tom Simpson. \"Haven't I promised to live in Holland, my duck, when we are mar ried? Won't I let you have all your own way ? And haven't I said that I would allow you what you like to keep your tulips and guinea-pigs with ? Oh, you darling 1\" \" Oh, this is dreadful affecting !\" said Von Straken. \" I must fill my pipe, again. It is too much. Ha! mine two little childer, come to mine arms, both of you. Miss Whilelmina, I will give you the house by the boompier, all for your own self ; and more, Tom Simpson and Co., I will give you one thousand gilders more than I said I would with mine own child. Ha !\" There was a great uplifting of hands at this, and the ladies looked upon Mr. Tom Simpson as rather a barbarian than otherwise ; but as that individual had been sent to Amsterdam on purpose to consolidate the interests of the houses of Simpson aud Straken by a union in his own proper person with the lovely Whilelmina, he was not disposed to take affront even at the polished condition of the place of his father-in-law that was to be ; and putting on a look of hilarity, he said \u2014 \" Very good,\" said Tom Simpson. \" I will answer for the old man in New gate Street, that he will [fork out for us another thousand, on the strength of your's, Mr. Straken, and if we don't do well then, it will be an odd thing to me. Come, my duck of a Whilelmina, let's have a kiss, and be friends again. Oh, you love 1\" \"Will you always love me?\" said Whilelmina. \" Come, now, Whilelmina, my duck, never mind the trouble ! Lord bless you, I have seen folks fall down waltzing it in London, even.\" \" I don't like yon,\" said Whilelmina. \"You don'tlike you \u2014 don't \u2014 don't like me ? Ha ! \u2014 ha 1 I flatter myself that that's rather impossible!\" Mr. Tom Simpson settled his stock, which was of a bright blue, with such little yellow sprigs of flowers upon it as never were seen ; and arranged his waistcoat, which looked as though it were fastened on to him by the contortions of a gold chain, that went round and round it, and in one button-hole, and out at the other, in the most extraordinary manner. \" Not like me ? Ha !\u2014 ha ! That's a joke ! I tell you what it is, Miss Whilelmina, you are \" To be sure I will.\" \"And be submissive and obliging, and let me have my own way ?\" \" Oh, of course. I think I see the old man in Newgate Street saying so much as, very gently, that his soul was his own to my mother, that's all ; she'd soon let him know the difference. I have been capitally brought up, I assure you, my duck of a Whilelmina.\""], [21, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, 11 Whilelmina was not proof against the flattery that came from the lips of the representative of Simpson and Co., and she turned, half smiling, towards him, as she said \u2014 and as a heavy rain began to fall, Amsterdam might be said to be truly frightened from its tranquillity. \"Oh, dear,\" said Tom Simpson, \"and I was just complimenting the climate upon its being such a capital one, and so quiet, and here it is making such a row, that it's enough to deafen any one. But, at all events, it's a good way off the storm, for I hear that the thunder grows fainter and fainter each minutes ; and as for those guns, I don't hear 'em at all now.\" \" The gqjid ship has gone down,\" said old Straken, who had picked up his pipe again, and was smoking away as if nothing had happened. \" Ab, I saw \u00bb ship go down once. Ah !\" \" You did ?\" ciied Tom Simpson. \" When was that !\" \" You know you are ugly, and that I don't like you, and can't like you ; but I suppose I \u2014 I \" \" Oh, that will do, my dear,\" said Tom. \"We don't want to be par ticular. All we want is love among the roses, and all that sort of thing ; and as Holland is a nice quiet place, where one can enjoy oneself without any distur bances\u2014\u2014\" Bang \u2014 bang \u2014 clap, rattle, boom ! came a thunder-clap, that shook the old house from its roof to its foundation. A scream burst from the lips of the ladies present. Whilelmina caught hold of Simpson round the neck, and fell with him again upon the highly-polished floor. Old Straken dropped his pipe, and the greatest terror prevailed in the apartment among them all. \" One storm,\" said Straken. \" The devil !\" said Tom Simpson. \" Oh, we shall all be killed !\" cried Whilelmina. \" It is the end of the world ! We shall all be killed !\" \"Mynheer Simpson and Co.,\" said old Straken, gravely, \" that is a very strange story, aad if my dear childer will sit down and listen, I will tell it to you all now. It will make all your hairs stand up. Ha! and turn all your blood to cream-cheese. Ha !\" \"Oh, father,\" said Whilelmina, \"you have often promised to tell us that story, but you never would do so.\" \" No, mine child, no. I was not like to tell you ; but now it seems as if a voice said to me, ' Mynheer Von Straken, tell the story of the wreck, and the mysterious man who gave you the broad gold pieces, and then went up the chimney 1' \" As he spoke, Von Straken pointed with the stem of his pipe up the capa cious chimney of the apartment in which they were, and every eye was turned in that direction. Boom ! came a dull heavy sound upon the air. It was a gun from some ship at sea. Every one waited a moment or two in breathless surprise, and then it came again with a dull heavy sound as from afar off. \"A wreck!\" said old Straken. \"A wreck in the Zuider Zee. Ha, some body will have his pipe put out, I'll warrant. Ha !\" A darkness now began to spread itself over the sky, such as at that season of the year was rarely to be found in the tianquil atmosphere of Holland. Dense black clouds were careering over the sky from seaward, and every minute there came the dull sound of the gun from the sea, while now and then a loud peal of thunder would awaken every echo in the old city. The festivities at the house of Mynheer Von Straken, which had been commenced upon the arrival of Tom Simpson, for the express purpose of doing honour to that young gentleman, were suspended, and the greatest excitement prevailed throughout the house. Crowds of peo ple, too, began to fly through the streets; \" What's up there ?\" cried Tom Simpson, as he projected his head right under the chimney-piece to look up, and got a flap of soot in one eye. \" Oh, the deuce ! \u2014 puff ! \u2014 murder !\" \" Mine excellent young friend,\" said Von Straken, \"you should not speak when you look up a chimney, for your breath; mine young friend, brings down one piece of soot into one eye.\" \"Oh, thank you; don't mention it. One generally gets some kind advise from our friends, just a little too kte. But don't mention it. I should lifce to hear this story, that's all.\" \" Listen, all of you,\" resumed the old"], [22, "12 VANDERDECKEN ; OR, man. \" Perhaps you don't know, any of you, that this house belonged to the celebrated Captain Mynheer Vander decken, now called the Flying Dutch man ?\" \" Who's a\u2014 a \u2014 fraid ?\" stammered Tom Simpson. \" Mine child,\" said the old man, \" something seems to say to me just now, ' Von Straken, tell the story of the wreck,' and so I must tell it. Never you mind the storm, but listen to me. Will you like to hear it, Mynheer Tom Simpson and Co. ?\" There was a movement of terror among the guests. \" Yes,\" added Von Straken, \"one hundred and thirty years ago he lived in this house, and that portrait over the chimney-piece is the portrait of his wife. Up-stairs in an old room, where there is a bed that nobody has slept in since Vanderdecken himself did, there is an old box with some of his clothes in it ; and many odds and ends are about the room that belonged to him. My grand- father, Solomon Straken, bought the house of the good provisor Vanderdecken, and its been in onr family ever since,\" \"But that's not the story, father,\" said Whilelmina. \"Oh, yes,'; said Tom. -. I\u2014 I\u2014 that is, who's afraid, you know ? Of course, I should like to hear it if it's very good \u2014Hem ! Why Whilelmina, my duck, you are all of a shake. Why don't you. be like me ?

But how dark it gets.\" \" It is sunset,\" said one of the guests ; \"and it may well get dark. We had better have lights, had we not ?\" \"No,\" said the old man. \"Mine good friends, the story I have got to tell had better be told now without a light, for it's quite sure to frighten you all, and then you won't see each other.\" \"They drew closer together around the old man, who, after about half-a- dozen extraordinary whiffs of his pipe, continued :\u2014 \"There was a storm, as there might be now, and it was this time of the year, when many ships of many nations are coming to trade with the old city. The thunder\u2014 oh ! \" A clap of thnnder seemed at that moment to explode just above the house, and Whilelmina sank upon her knees at her father's feet, while Tom Simpson screwed up his lips, and tried to whistle a tune, but failed entirely. \"Ah! that was the way the thunder kept coming, and now and then the lightning\"- Whiz! came a bewildering flash of hgtmng past the window of the room. \"There was a storm,\" then added old Straken. \"There was a storm, like the storm now; and there was a ship away out beyond the Zuider Zee, and she fired guns of distress \u2014 boom ! \u2014 boom ! every minute ; and I was out upon the coast, and saw her lights, and I saw a rocket that she sent up all blue and firery ; and then down went the ship \u2014 right down into the sea, and the water came boiling and bubbling up like a cauldron ; and it was all over, and the good folks said that not a soul was saved, and I came home with my heart heavy to think of the brave men that went down in the ship, and the nutmegs made me weep \u2014 Ha !\" \" The nutmegs ?\" cried Tom Simpson. \"How did nutmegs make you weep, father-in-law that is to be ?\" \" They all went down\u2014 down ! The ship had a cargo of nutmegs ! Oh\u2014 oh ! it was sad to think of ! I came home and sat in this chair, by this very fireside, and looked at this very chimney, when there came a knock at the outer door, and an old servant we had, named Maria, opened it. I heard some one talking in the hall, and then that door opened, and a man came into this room with a face so white that I don't know what it was like except paper. That must be the nearest to it, and he laid \u2014 \" 'Mynheer Von Straken, 1 am the only one who was saved from the wreck in the ZuiderZee; will you give me sheltei \"Oh, father\u2014 father 1M said Whilel mina, \"do not tell the story now.

Oh, lor ! \u2014 oh, lor ! dat is what me call witchcraft, massa.\" The negro had left the door of the room open, and now upon its threshold there stood a tall figure, enveloped in a cloak. AU eyes were bent upon it ; and then, amid the intense stillness of the room, the figure slowly advanced, and in a soft voice of peculiar beauty, spoke \u2014 \"Much I fear,\" it said, \"that this is an intrusion ; but a large ship has gone to piece off the coast, and I am the only sutviver I fear of the wreck. May I hope that some compassion will be shown to me here, tor when I inquired as I came along in the city who was the most kind and hospitable man in Amster dam, the people with one voice said \u2014 ' Mynheer Von Straken !' and then they pointed out the house to me.\" By the time this speech from the stranger was finished, Von Straken had been raised from the corner into which he had fallen, and was staring at the stranger with all his eyes. Tom Simpson, too, had recovered himself a little from his fright, and Whilelmina was fully assured that the stranger had the finest eyes she had ever seen in all the world. \"If,\" continued the stranger, \"my presence here is a great intrusion \u2014 and, alas, the presence cf the unfortunate is too often considered tc be such \u2014 I will go at once ; but yet I linger, with the hope that it is not so.\" No, no,\" gaspedMynheer VonStraken. \"No. Oh, dear no.

Do you love her, Mynheer Von Straken?' \" \" Ob, what a nice man he must have been,\" said Whilelmina. \" Did you not pity him, father, and give him the best the old house could afford ?\" \"I did, mine child, I did; and he took his pipe and we sat and smoked by the chimney-side, here, and then he said, as he took a little box from his pocket \u2014 \" ' I have here, Mynheer Von Straken, a little string of jewels, which I will leave with you.' \" The old man had only got thus far in his narrative when there came a violent knocking at the door of the house, and everybody started up in amazement. Whilelmina shrieked out, and Tom Simpson made a violent effort to squeeze himself right into the chim ney-corner, past old Straken. \"Oh, dear, murder!\" he cried. \" Murder ! W'hat does it all mean ? Is that him at the door ?\" At this really awful suggestion, Whilelmina turned as pale as death, and the guests all made such a rush to the end of the room where old Von Straken was, that that worthy and exemplary person was upset chair and all, and what was worse, pipe and all, into a corner, where he lay, looking the picture of misery and helplessness. Bang came the knock at the door again, and then a black servant that be longed to the family rolled into the room, crying out as he did so\u2014 \" Oh, massa, him sailor at 'em door, and him say him a shipwreck, and want to ab de pleasure ob seeing ob you, massa.\" \"Oh, gracious, I'm not at home,\" gasped Von Straken."], [24, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 14 The stranger pressed the long silky tress of Whilelmina' s hair to his lips.

I was one of those who, with a plank only between me and eternity, chose to go into the sea. A friendly current drove me to the shore, and in a hut by the banks of a stream that you call the gilder stream, a peasant lent me this suit of dry clothing, which I fear is old-fashioned.\" As he spoke, he took off his large cloak, and then they all saw that he had on a suit of plum-coloured cloth, made in a very ancient style of cut and fashion, indeed. Old Von Straken groaned loudly, and goggled his eyes about in such a way, that Whilelmina was quite alarmed, and two of the guests banged him upon the back to keep him from going right off into a faint. Old Von Straken suddenly rose to his feet, and with, for him, the most un wonted energy, he cried out \u2014 \"Help, all of you ! Help to turn him out of the old house. Where is the gun ? Oh, where is mv grandfather's gun ?\" This effort of the old man's was so great a one, that after he had made it he fell back in his chair again, and seemed to be in a half-swoon. Whilelmina became alarmed, but instead of appealing to these old friends who were about her, and who she knew so well, it was to the mysterious stranger that she turned, saying\u2014 \" Oh, father ! \u2014 father !\" said she, \" what is the meaning of all this ?

Is he very ill ?\" \" No,\" said the stranger. \" No, fair one, he is not ; but I am sure that he would like now to speak with me alone.\" \" Would you, father ?\" Old Von Straken just managed to nod his head in acquiescence, and then Whil elmina moved towards the door of the room, saying \u2014 As he spoke, he passed across his fingers one of the long tresses of Whilelmina's hair, which had escaped \u2014 perhaps, from a little wilful coquetry \u2014 fromthe silkennet that confined the remainder of her curls. She smiled, and with a strange, abstrac ted look, she stood with old Von Stra ken's pipe in her hand, as though en tranced. \" Yes,\" added the stranger, \" such a lock of hair as this it was that I once pressed to my heart, amid the strife of the billows, and then I heard a faint voice sing \u2014 \"If it be my father's will that he should speak alone to this stranger, we will all go into the room above, will we not?\" \" Any room with you, you duck of a Whilelmina,\" said Tom Simpson, with an air of gallantry. Whilelmina, however, turned from him, and it was quite evident as she left the room that she was enhanced in some strange way with the stranger, for it was quite with a half-smile that she regarded him, and he replied to it by singing in a low voice \u2014 \" ' The ships on the hillow, The wind whistles free ; Bat the pledge of your true love Is still dear to thee .

I saw it from the first moment that I came into this room. Others may have j their doubts about me, but you have / none.

But \u2014 but \" \" But what ?\" The guests were in amazement at the strange proceedings, but as Whilelmina was her father's housekeeper, and had, since the death of her mother, been the uncontrolled mistress of the house, they could not very well say anything in contradiction to her wish to repair to another room with the guests. It was Tom Simpson only who resisted a little. \" I say, Mynheer Straken,\" he said, \" you had better let me stay. I daresay it is some begging affair, after all ; and as a junior partner in the house that is to be of Simpson, Straken and Co., I will soon fob him off, if you leave it to me.\" \" No ! Mine got, no !\" said Von Straken. After that positive denied, Simpson had nothing to do but io leave, so that in a few moments the old Amsterdam merchant was alone with his mysterious guest. There was a fire burning in the grate, or rather upon some iron dogs on the ample hearth ; for although the summer had really came, it was yet early in the season, and the damp air of that low lying district required a cheerful blaze nearly all the year round to prevent it from breeding coughs and rheumatism. The night had, however, crept on, and the fire, through neglect, had burnt low, and only sent into the old room, the walls and ceiling of which were blackened with age, a dull red colour. The wind moaned past the latticed windows, and a strange sound came upon the ear from afar off. It was the subdued roar of the \" I thought you would surely never come again after so long a time.\" \" Yes, I know that that was what you thought, old man ; but you see that I am here, and you know me again. When last we met I gave you a string of jewels.

Was it not so ?\" \"Oh, yes\u2014 yes.\" \" 'Tis well. When I came here you were a poor man \u2014 a very poor man, Von Straken.

The old merchant sat far back in his chair, and the mysterious stranger faced him. \"Von Straken,\" he said, \"do you know me ?\" A slight movement of his hands was the only reply that Von Straken made to him."], [26, "16 VANDERDECKEN. successful venturers in every port in the world. You are rich, Von Straken.\" Straken,\" said the stranger. \"' It is amazing that the fall of an old portrait from these time-worn walls, should cause so great a tumult. There it lies.\" All eyes were now directed to the portrait that lay upon the floor; and one of the guests cried out \u2014 \"Why, it's the portrait of Vander decken's wife \u2014 he who is now the Flying Dutchman, and who cruises, in fair weather and foul, off the Cape, and can never double it, or touch the land again.\" \"I\u2014 I am.\" \" Well ! There was a condition ac companying the gift.\" The old'merchant slid off his chair on to his knees, and lifting up his hands, he said \u2014 \" Oh, no \u2014 no ! Do not come now to take from me the light of my old age \u2014 the treasure of mv house \u2014 the dia mond of my heart ! What to me are all my riches \u2014 all my -spacious ware houses \u2014 all my ships, if you take from me for ever my Whilelmina, my only child 1\" \"Yes,\" said the stranger, \"it is the portrait of the wife of Vanderdecken, who is off the Cape, as you say. But I have business with him, Mynheer Straken. I am sure the fair Whilelmina will not say that 1 shall go. Alas, there are many poor souls with Vander decken in his fated ship.\" He gently touched Whilelmina's arm as he spoke. She shuddered, and yet smiled ; and then, in a strange wild plaintive voice, he sang, or rather repeated in a kind of recitative \u2014 A rattling peal of thunder at this moment shook the old house, and the portrait that was on the chimney-pieee of Vanderdecker's wife, fell with a crash to the floor. CHAPTER V. A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE. Von Straken rose from his knees, and uttered a cry. \" The wild winds are dashing That ship on the sea ; From tho storm of the ocean It reached the ears of his guests, and his daughter, Whilelmina, and his son-in law that was to be, the representative of Simpson and Company, and they all rushed into the apartment. Whilelmina rushed up to her fu\u00bb_!_.er, exclaiming \u2014 \" Oh, father, father ! what iias hap pened ? Help ! help I Tlio lijhtning has struck him.\" It sighs to be free. But the curse has gone forth, And it stems the salt wave, Washed by tears of the trustful, The good, and the brave.\" There was a pause, and a deathlike stillness reigned in the room for a few minutes. Whilelmina smiled sadly, and it was quite evident that she was in a state of strange abstraction. The chant ing tone in which the stranger spoke to her, seemed to have deprived her of all consciousness of surrounding objects. \" Oh, bother all this,\" said Tom Simpson. \" Whilelmina, what is the matter with you ?'' \"My child\u2014 my only child !\" said old Straken. \"No,\" said Von Straken\u2014 \"no. It ha3 not.\" \" Ob, thank Heaven !\" The mysterious stranger stood with his back against the wall, and his arms folded across his chest. At first, in the confusion, he was not observed by the guests ; but Simpson saw him at length, and going up to him, he said \u2014 \" I tell you what it is old fellow\u2014 I don't want to say anything unpleasant, bat the sooner you take yourself off from here the better. There has been nothing but disturbance in the old house since you came into it.

Come, be off.\" \"I have business with Mynheer Whilelmina started as though awakening from a dream, and looked around her. \" Where am I ? Ob, where am I ? Father, where am I ? \u2014 what has hap - pened ?\" \" Nothing,\" said Von Straken, as he moved his hands up and down like the fins of some immense fish. \" Nothing \u2014 ob, nothing, my child, my darling.

The fire crackled, and hissed in the I old grate, and from the rattling noise without, it was evident that the storm had degenerated to a heavy rain. \" Listen to me, O mysterious man ! It is true that I took your jewels. Alas, it was for tbe sake of the little child you then saw ; but I have parted with but one of them, and from that one I have grown rich. I will return you, now, hack all the others, and twice the , value of the one I sold in good gilders. Let that satisfy you ; and, oh ! let my j child be with me still.

The stranger heard him to an end, with out an interruption, and then, when the old man had ceased to speak, he replied to him in a deep, solemn tone \u2014 \"Von Straken, from where those jewels came, I could heap them up before you like household sand, or like pebbles upon the sea-shore. It is the jewel of your daughter's love that I wish lor, not your gilders,\" The old man groaned. \" Beware how you tamper with your oath, old man ! You have sworn it, and you must keep it !\" \"But \u2014 but I cannot force my child.\" \" You will not need.

I then resume the thread of our discourse. You made me a promise, and you bound it by an oath that in its conditions called down per dition upon your head if you broke it in word or spirit. Do you remember that ?\" \"Oh, I do\u2014 Idol\" \" 'Tis well : I have the contract here.\" He took a metal box from his pocket, and slightly tapped the lid of it. \" But,\" gasped Straken. \" But will nothing move you ? Oh, will nothing content you, mysterious man, inexpli cable being, will nothing hut \u2014 but- ' \" Go on, Straken.\" \" But the fulfilment of the bond con tent you ?\" \" Nothing.\" \"Oh, consider!

Have you no heart ?\" \"I gave you,\" said the stranger, solemnly, \" a string, which in its knots and folds knitted together many more jewels ; you were then poor, and dared not hold up your head among the mer chants of the city, and yet you pined to do so.

The fair and gentle Whilelmina is willing to be mine.\" \" But tell me who and what you are, mysterious being ! Are you mortal ?\" \"Alas! lam.\" Whilelmina? You understand, then, that Mynheer Vanderdecken commanded the good ship Dottenswold, and it was bound for the Isle of Prance ; but a gale of wind from the north-west kept it beating about the Cape of Good Hope for seven nights and days, and Captain Vanderdecken swore more and more at the weather, and his mate, a pious man, name Elkenwalden went up to him on the quarter-deck on the seventh day, and said to him, ' Captain, it is quite clear that it is not tbe will of Providence that we should double the Cape. Let us put about, ship, and go home ;' and then Captain Vanderdecken, he shook bis fist in the face of the cloudy sky, and he swore that neither man, nor devil, nor Heaven either should make him turn back, and that be would beat about to double the Cape till the day of judg- ment, rather than he would give it up; and he called upon the crew, crying out, ' Who will back me in that, my lads ?' aud they^all raised a shout, and a laugn, and said they would stay by him ; but the mate, he flung himself into the sea, declaring that he would not remain on board of such a craft, and he was picked up by a spice trader, and brought safely into port here at Amsterdam.\" \" And Vanderdecken \u2014 whatbecame of him?\" \"Your name \u2014 your family \u2014 whence come you ? What are your pursuits ? Is it possible that you can think that I would give my daughter to a nameless stranger ?\" \" My name is Diderich. Let that suffice.\" \" No \u2014 no. I cannot \u2014 I will not sacri fice my only child. She has been so good and kind to me.

But he is poor ; and, although I do think love-tokens passed between him and my child, I would not wed hpr to a failen house.\" \" TheCarlis' were rich a hundred years ago.\" \"They were; but now they are bro ken down, and there are no burgomas ters among the Carlis'.\" \"So changes the fortunes of the world,\" said the stranger. \" Why, it was but one hundred and sixty years ago that a Carlis gave laws to Amster dam, and was the king of all its com merce. \u2014 How is it that they are now iu such a state of decadence ?\" \" All, Mynheer ! his wife waited for him, and his children waited for him, and his owners waited for him ; but the ship Dottenswold never came into port again, and they say, that at the Cape, when the weaiher is foul, that the ship may still be seen with all her sails set, and the wretched Vanderdecken on her deck, with his phantom crew about him ; and there he will cruise till the day of judgment.\" \" Ha ! an idle tale.\" ''The firstship that they lost, was the one commanded by Vanderdecken. That was long, long ago, and this was his house. Misfortune after misfortune followed that loss, and then they sunk to rise no more.\" \" 1 have been long from Amsterdam.

After the old merchant had told this tale to the stranger, the latter rested his face upon his hands, and for a few moments he shook as with a violent emotion. Then looking up, with his pale and ghastly face, and his glittering eye, he said \u2014 \" I am sad and weary. Let me go to my rest.\" \" Yes, but my child \u2014 my poor child 1\" \"What of her?\" \" I will follow you.\" Von Straken 'led the way up the staircase, and as they passed a door immediately at the top of the flight, they heard the murmur of conversation within. The guests of the merchant were there, wondering at the delay that had taken place in their being summoned to the lower room again. With a deep sigh the old man passed on, followed by his mysterious and most unwelcome guest. At, the end of a long corridor, such as ave common in the old Dutch houses, Von Straken opened a [door that conducted to a dim suite of apart ments, that had not been entered for years. The air was damp and musty, and the light burned dimly within them. \"You will spare her ? You will take the gilders ? You will not insist upon the bond ?\" \"Mynheer Von Straken \u2014 this day week I will come to claim my bride.\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" \" Yes. On your soul be it to make such proposition by that time as befits the occasion. You have ample means, and need spar eno cost. This day week. remember. That will give you time, to break off your arrangements with the young man, whom I find in the character of a suitor in this house. Remember your oath.\" The stranger paused for a moment at the entrance to these rooms, and shud dered. The old merchant, as he held up the light to show him across the threshold, saw the shivering action, and he spoke to him, saying \u2014 \"Ah, these were Vanderdecken's dwelling rooms. You slept in one of them fifteen years ago.\" \"1 did. That was when we last met.\" \" I must \u2014 I must. I cannot tamper with Heaven. The wretched Vander decken is already a sad example of such danger ; I dare not do it. But you may perhaps, yet be merciful. And if Whilelmina should refuse ?\" \"Then are you free, and yet your oath well kept ; but it by word, or look, or action \u2014 if so much as by a single tear, you tempt her to refuse from love for you, and feeling for your feelings, your oath is broken.\" \" Yes, it was, and when you gave me the jewels, that I then thought so much of, but which now \" \" You think little of, as it is the fashion of the world to think little of the step ping-stones that lead to fortune, after the fortune is attained. Is it not so. Von Straken ?\" \" It is\u2014 it it. I know\u2014 I feel it.\" \"Enough. I am very weary, and would to my chamber, now, at once. Oh, Mynheer, keep to your oath. Remem ber the fate of Vanderdecken, who out raged Heaven, and keep your oath. Now I will to my repose.\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes, you shall go to your repose, Mynheer ; but this is not a well appointed house for guests. You shall go to your repose. I will myself conduct you. But you have taken no refreshment. Surelv, you will eat and drink?\" The merchant felt the truth of the reproach, and walked in silence into the first of the suite of rooms, which con sisted of five tolerably spacious apart ments, the only blemish to which was that the ceilings were very low and heavy, being crossed by huge oaken beams, in every possible direction. \"Here you may rest,\" said Straken, \" and if you wait a little, I will brin\"- you a cloak or two, as well as some faggots, \"No. I want nothing.\" The old merchant rose, and taking a"], [31, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 21 with which you may light a fire. Only 6ay what you will drink or eat, and you shall have your wishes supplied. I will bring you a pipe.\" \" No \u2014 no. I want rest. Nothing but rest.\" \" Diderich,\" replied the merchant. \" Why, my dear uncle's name was Diderich,\" cried the rather corpulent widow, Jansens. \" Did he really say his name was Diderich ? Ah, dear me.\" \" It is a common name in Holland, I believe,\" said Tom Simpson. \"Some thing like Smith in England. The Simp sons are considered the oldest family, though, and are all looked up to in Lon don.\" The tone in which these words were spoken, was one of such sadness, that even Von Straken made no reply, but cautiously repaired to the room below ; and he was heartily glad when he had regained his pipe and called his friends to the fire again. \"Gone, father?\" said Whilelmina; \"is he quite gone, father ?\" The old merchant shook his head, re filled his pipe, and then replied in the affirmative. \"Are they so tall, then?\" said Plora, archlv. \" fall !\u2014 tall ! Oh, I understand that \u2014that you don't understand. I mean that the Simpsons are thought a great deal of in London. It's quite common for the Lord Mayor, if any difficult point comes before him, to say, \u2014 ' Send for Mr, Simpson.' \" \" Let me see the piece of coral, my dear,\" said Widow Jansens, to Flora. \" Oh, certainly. Here it is \u2014 He cer tainly was handsome !\" \u2014 she handed the coral to the widow \u2014 \" that is to say, he he\u2014did I say handsome? \u2014 Ob, he was an old wretch, and his eyes looked like pieces of tin!\" \" Bless him !\" said Widow Jansens ; \" I noticed what a fall he had in his back. Now, was he not a really noble looking man ? He reminded me, do you know, all of you, of my first liusbond very much, and he was considered to be the handsomest man in all Rotterdam, when we were married. Heigho ! Mynheer Straken, do you know where the hand some sailor has gone to ?\" The company stared, and Tom Simp son cried out, \u2014 \"Why, upon my life, ladies, you seem to take it by turns to fall in love with that Mr. Diderich. What can be the meaning of it all ?\" \" Oh, Whilelmina,\" said a young lady, who was sitting next to her, \" what is this that has fallen out of your pocket, when you took out your tablets ?\" \"What?\u2014 what? I had nothing else.\" \" Oh, yes, look ! It is a little bit of rock coral, 1 think.\" \" Rock coral in my pocket !\" said Whilelmina. \" Ah ! how I wish I could recollect the words of that song!\u2014 He had fine eyes !\" \" Who ?\" gasped Tom Simpson. \u00ab Who ?'- \" The poor shipwrecked man ; and bow gentle and soft his voice was, too, was it not? Will you have it, Flora ? Take it.\" The young girl took it, and then Whilelmina, with a suddenly changed expression of countenance, said, \u2014 \"Patber, if yon make the house into a hospital for shipwrecked ugly men, it won't be endurable.\" \" My dear,\" said old Straken, \"what do you mean? Oh, tell us. Do you like that strange man, or not f \" Like him, father ? Impossible I\" *' Then nothing would induce you to \u2014to \" \" Oh, nothing \u2014 nothing !\" cried the old merchant, dropping the pipe from his trembling hands, with which he had been provided by Whilelmina. \" It is nothing ! \u2014 oh, it is nothing !\" \" But where is he ?\" said the widow. \" What, father ?\" \"Nothing. Give me my pipe\u2014 my pipe, my dear. Where is it ? Where is my pipe ? I must try to think of all this ; my brains don't seem as if they could.\" \" I\u2014 I don't know.\" \"Ah, me! He was a nice man. Diderich, too, was his name. 1 shall dream of him to-night, I know I shall. With that fine fall in his back, too\u2014 for all the world like my first husband. I'll just tell you all about how 1 met him first, our marriage, and his death.\" While Flora continued to turn the small piece of coral in her hand, she continued to pour forth praises of the shipwrecked stranger. \" What is his name, Von Straken ?\" asked Flora."], [32, "22 VANDERDECKEN; OR, The old man rocked to and fro upon his chair, and rubbed his knees with the palms of his huge hands. \" Yes,\" he added, \" before that dreadful man came, who, if he be not Vanderdecken the Flying Dutchman, is the devil, I was a hapoy Straken; but now I am the most miserable man in all Amsterdam.\" There was a general movement upon this among the guests, and if the cordial waters, and the Hollands, and the sweet cakes, and the baked meats had not come in at that momen'., there is no knowing how many of them would have recol lected that they ought to be home early. The long stories of the Widow Jansens were the dread of Amsterdam. It was midnight when the party broke up. The widow carried away with her the piece of rock coral ; Whilelmina kissed her father, and retired to her chamber; and the old merchant remained by the embers of the fire alone \u2014 No, he was not alone. He had his pipe. After coming to this conclusion, the old merchant reached out his hand to the bottle of Hollands that was left upon the table, and applying it to his lips, he took a deep draught, of it that would have been enough to have suffocated, off hand, any ordinary person, and put them out of their troubles for ever \" Ah ! that is good.\" Mynheer Von Straken wiped his mouth with his capacious sleeve. \" I always find,\" he said, \" that about one pint of good old Hollands makes one's brain clear, and rouses up the judgment like \u2014 like \u2014 Ah, it warms up the judgment, it does, indeed.\" Von Striken had never made a simile in all his life, so it was no wonder that his imagination broke down upon this occasion when he made the attempt. The wind was now in strong and fitful gusts whistling rouud the old house, and now and then it came down the chimney, roaring like some living thing, and whirled about the half-dead embers upon the hearth in an alarming manner. It was just after one of these ebulli tions of eccentricity upon the part of the wind, that Von Straken became aware of a slight knock at the outer door of his house. CHAPTER VII. PARTICULARISES AN EVENTFUL NIGHT AT THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE. Yes, there sat old Vtm Straken in that banquet-ball deserted, after all his guests had left him, and that light of his eyes, his young child, Whilelmina, had retired to her pillow. ,, The storm that had vexed the Zuyder Zee did not seem to be all gone, for now and Ihtn there were mysterious mut- terings of wind in the old capacious chimney, and afar off the merchant thought that at times he heard the faint echo of the thunder. For an hour Von Straken sat and smoked his pipe. Only twice he took it from, his moui.h to utter two loud groans. His pipe was at length out, and when he ascertained the fact, which he did, after making a strange sqeaking noise through the empty tube, he laid it gently down, and said, with an intona tion of great grief and despair \u2014 \"Oh!\" The merchant did not start. It was rather, we should opine, out of the ques tion for such a mountain of flesh to start as Von Straken was composed of; but he opened his eyes a little wider, and his ears moved. Never before had the mind of old Von Straken been disturbed to anything like the extent that had taken place that evening. Tap \u2014 tap, came the knock again. \"Another \u2014 another,\" said Von Stra ken. \" I was poor,\" he said. \" 1 was a raided merchant, and this old house, the last of my possessions, would have been torn from me by my creditors \u2014 for it is a dreadful thing in Amsterdam to owe any money that you caunot pay ; but even then I was happier that I am now, with all my money ; for no one could come to me and say \u2014 ' Von Straken, I m^t have your phild !' Oh\u2014 oh\u2014 oh !\" Tap \u2014 tap. Like some huge mountain of jelly, Von Straken shook a little, and then fixing his eyes upon his empty pipe, he said \u2014 \" What shall I do ?' Tap\u2014 tap came the sound upon the outer door again, and from the quiet and gentle wanner of them, it was quite"], [33, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 23 evident, that whoever was there had no desire to disturb the whole household, bitt piobably had some idea that the merchant was up, and only wished to attract his individual attention. \" The only person (hat I fear in all the world,\" he said, \"is in the chamber above, where, if he were mortal at all, which, alas, meine Got ! he is not, lie would catch his death of cold in Ihe damp old bed that has not been slept upon for so many a long year.\" With this kind speech concerning his guest, Von Straken made towards the door of his house, and before he opened it, he, like a prudent man, called out \u2014 \" Who is there ?\" Indeed, if Mynheer Von Straken bad only given it a thought, there was anijjle crevices in the old massive window-shutters through which, if any one choose to climb up to them, they might have peeped in the room, and so seen him there sitting with all his ease, and his empty pipe. But, Mynheer Von Straken was not a very thoughtfully suggestive man, and things came upon him generally in a series of little surprises. Tap\u2014 tap. \" 1 do begin to think now,\" he said, \" that some one is at the outer-door !\" \" It is I, Mynheer Von Straken. It is I,\" said a voice. \" Who is I ?\" \"Oh, Mynheer, do you not know me? I am young Wurtem Carlis, who was once rich, but who now, alas\u2014 alas ! \" \" Is poor !\" said Von Straken. \" Very poor, indeed !\" \" Ah ! all Amsterdam knows that. After coming to this sagacious conclu sion, which, considering that the knock ing, slight as it was, had gone on for about a quarter of an hour, was not a very wonderful stretch of fancy, the old man began to ask himself who it could be, that at such a time was anxious for admission to his house. But what do you want, with me, young man ? Have I not forbidden you my doors ? \u2014 Have I not told you that you should not cross my threshold ?\" \" Yes, you have \u2014 you have.\" \"Well, and here you come. Is it, not an infamous thing that after that I am obliged to say, ' Here you come ?' \" \"Listen to me, Mynheer Von Straken, and I will tell you how it is, and why it is that I am here. You forbade me your house, and that was enough for me. I have never since then set foot within it. To be sure, there was nothing so very extraordinary, after all, in some one call ing at Mynheer Von Straken's even at such an hour of the night, for, as the mysterious stranger had said, he pos sessed many ships, and the quays of Amsterdam were crowded with the huge hulls of his vessels; so when any of them bore into port at an unex pected time, the captain was sure to come up to the house of her owner to let him know. I might have done so, for there was no one in all your household who would have told you, if I had been in any of your chambers.\" \" Bah 1\" cried Von Straken. Von Straken never bad any objection to being awakened with the pleasing intelligence that one of his vessels had reached the port with a rich cargo. His subsequent sleep was all the more profound and comfortable after such a piece of news. And now the rich merchant began to flatter himself that such was the cause of the knocking at his outer door. \"It is a captain come to tell me good news,\" he said. \" There is spice from Arabia, elephants' teeth from the African coast, or tea from China, and I will go to the door without fear.\" He rose with some difficulty. It was never a very easy job for Mynheer Von Straken to rise. \"You may doubt it, but yet it is true. Nevertheless, Mynheer Von Straken, I took no sort of advantage of such a state of things; and, as I say, I have never entered your house since you forbade it to me, although 1 loved your dear, kind \" \" Hold your tongue, will you ?\" \" Good, beautiful \" \"Peace \u2014 peace !\" \"Angelic, lovely \u2014 oh, so lovely! \u2014 daughter, Whilelmina, as mvin never loved young girl before ; and a Ithough I feel that I shall love as long as I live, and long after it, too, unless envious death has the effect of deprit Ing us of the memory of all we thouj lit lovable and beautiful on earth \u2014 \""], [34, "VANDERDECKEN. 24 crevices of the shutters, sitting in your room with your pipe, and so being as sured that you were up.\" \" But what can you have to say to me ?\" \"Let me in, and I will tell you, honoured sir !\" \" Hold your idle tongue, will yon ?\" \" No, Mynheer Von Straken, I can not\u2014indeed I cannot, for I have come here on purpose to speak ; so it would be a very foolish thing for me to hold my tongue.\" \"All, but,\" said Von Straken, \"you did not expect to see me. Ha! ha! No \u2014 no, you did not expect to see me P\" \" Yes, I did !\" \" How ? Do you tell me that you came to this house with the hope of seeing the person who told you, you should not cross its threshold ?\" \"Oh ! Well, I will, I think\u2014 that is, I won't.\" \" Alas ! Farewell, then, for ever !\" \"No\u2014 stop! I will\u2014 no\u2014 yes ! Will yon promise to go away again peaceably the moment I tell you to do so ?\" \" On my soul, yes !\" \" Come in, then. It shall not be said that Von Straken, at a time when he felt peculiarly comfortable and happy himself, kept any one outside his door. Come in.\" With this decidedly hypocritical speech, the merchant opened the door, and let young Wurtem Carlis into his house. \" Yes, Mynheer Von Straken, I will tell you the truth. I am going far, far away from Amsterdam for ever. Oh, no \u2014 no \u2014 no !\" \"What does the boy mean? Is he mad ?\" \" No, Mynheer, but if you will open t he door, 1 huve something very impor i ant to tell you. Do open it. Whilelmina is in bed, I daresay.\" \"Now, if this is not impudence,\" sa:d Von Straken, \" 1 don't know what is ! He want's me to open the door because Whilelmina is in bed ! Ah ! how far he would have been frpm so doing, if all things had been with him as they were only a few hours since ! But misfortune softens the heart, and makes us sigh for home -companionship, and induces a kinder affection of the feelings of others. Von Straken's pride of wealth was taken down wonderfully since the visit of the mysterious sailor, and he could be civil and considerate now to one whom he would previously have treated with all the haughty contempt and con tumely of purse-proud arrogance. But such is human nature. The seducing rascal ! You villain ! how dare you speak to me in such a way?\" \"Ah, Mynheer, you misconstrue me very much. I meant no offence. IoDly meant that, as the dear Whilelmina, bless her bright eyes, and her nice round cheeks ! was in bed, you could do no harm in opening the door, as I could not see her, nor could she see me at such an hour.\" The poor, discarded young lover stepped over the threshold of the house, where, if poverty had not come upon him and his race, he would have been ever a welcome guest ; and when he saw by the dim light that streamed through the half open door of the room that was so close at hand, the portly form of the marchant, he bowed low, saying \u2014 \" I salute you, Mynheer Von Straken, with all the respect due to the father of such a pearl as Whilelmina.\" \" Pho !\" said Von Straken. \" We will have no more of that.\" Von Straken slowly placed his little fat finger by the side of his nose, and acknowledged to himself, that there was some truth in what young Carlis said. He felt himself inclined to let him in. He was very lonely, indeed, and while the mysterious stranger was in the house, sleep with him was quite out of the question. Von Straken at that time could have almost smoked a pipe with the greatest enemy he ever had in all the world, that he could. It would almost appear as if young Wurtem Carlis guessed what was passing in the merchant's mind, for he said\u2014 \" Ah, Mynheer ! to convince you that this is no proj ected clandestine visit to your house, I beg to tell you that 1 should not havo knocked at the door at all if I had not seen you through the \" As you please, sir.\" \" Follow me, young man ; and if you have anything really to say, say it at once, and I beg that you will admire \u2014 '' \" Whilelmina, Mynheer ?\" \" No\u2014 no. It is the wonderful con descension that I exhibit in permitting"], [35, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 25 you to come into this house, that I ex pect you to admire.\" \"Very good, Mynheer Von shaken. I do admire it, and I wdl follow you into the parlour, if you will be to good as to lead the way.\" This Von Straken did. He thought it was a blessed thing upon that night of terrors to have sitting up with him a Christian soul ; Liid although he af fected to be wonderfully condescendiu... to young Wurtem Carlis, yet he made VON STRAKIN AND WURTEM CARLIS ALARMED EV THE __IY-.TERIl.US SHRIEKS. up his nrnd to keep him there as long as he could, just for the sake of com pany. The old merchant filled his pips again, and then waving its stem, he motioned to Wurtem Carlis to be seated, and after a grave silence, he said \u2014 : Well, you are here. What have you to snv ? \" Ah,\" said the young man, \" and she has been only recently in this very room ! Perhaps she sat upon this chair. Perhaps she laid her hand upon this very No. 4."], [36, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 26 table. Ah, me ! she breathed the air of this room only a little while ago ! bless her ! I think\" I see her now.\" open, and rushed up the dark staircase, callinar out as he went \u2014 \" Whilelmina ! Whilelmina i It is I ! It is your own Wurtem Carlis. Let me know where you \" Another scream guided the young lover to a door some short distance along the corridor to his right. It was fast, but one rush that he made against it sufficed to open it, and he rolled headlong into the chamber of the young and pure Whilelmina. By the light of a night light, young Carlis saw something enveloped in white drapery lying upon the floor. One glance showed him that it was no other than his own beloved Whilelmina. To raise her in his arms was the work of a moment, and then he held her to his heart. She struggled faintly, and opened her eyes, and looked at him. \"My own dear Whilelmina!\" he said. Puff\u2014 puff! went Mynheer Von Straken at his pipe. \" It is something,\" continued young Carlis \u2014 \" something do I call it ? Oh, it is very much to breathe the same air with her ! To feel that one is under the same quiet roof, so \" \" Poh '. hush ! hiss ! boh !\" cried Von Straken. The young man sighed deeply. \"Mine young friend,\" said Von Straken, \"if you have nothing to say to me but that you are out of your mind about my daughter, you had better sit still and say nothing, for I don't want to hear it. She is to be married to Simpson and Co., as you and as all Amsterdam now know well, and I don't want to hear anything from you about it, that I don't ; so be quiet. Ha ! be quiet !\" \" Oh, Wurtem, is it you ?\" \" It is\u2014 it is.\" \" I am going to faint !\" \" Oh, never mind \u2014 never mind. Faint, dear Whilelmina, if you feel at all inclined to do so ! Faint in my arms !\" Whilelmina took him at his word, and shutting up her eyes, fainted right away off-hand. CHAPTER VIII, FORTUNE FAVOURS THE YOUNG LOVER. Von Straken dropped his pipe. A scream came upon his ears, and then another. \"Meine Got ! what's that ?\" We cannot say where Wurtem Carlis got bis recipe for restoring a young lady who had fainted ; but giving him credit for the very best intentions in the world, and that the restoration of Whilelmina was his motive, it was quite evident that he thought an extraordinary amount of kissing was the very thing to do it. He kissed her all down her face, beginning at the top of her head, and then he kissed her all the way up again, beginning at her chin; and he kissed her cheeks and her eyes; and all the time he held her in his arms ; and she had on a very small amount of drapery, indeed, as regards the quality and the thickness of it : but that was no matter. Another scream, louder than both the former ones, evidently proceeded from the upper part of the old house. Young Wurtem Carlis sprang to his feet quicker than any Dutchman had ever sprung to his feet before, aud with an energy that was as un-Dutchlike as it could very well be, cried out \u2014 \" It is\u2014 it is the voice of my Whilel mina !\" \"No,\" said old Von Straken, shaking as if he were in an ague. \" No \u2014 no. Oh, no, don't say that.\" '' It is. I will fly to her rescue !\" The old merchant himself rose, and got half way towards the door that opened from the room to the dark staircase leading to the upper part of the house. A huge table was between Carlis and that door, but to save time, he made but one vault right over it, and alighting partly upon the back of Von Straken, he knocked him flat to the floor, and then galloping over him, without the smallest ceremony, he dashed the door The most extraordinary thing was, that the more he kissed her, the more com plete and perfect appeared to be the fainting fit into which she had fallen ; and at last he carried her to the bed, and laid her very gently down. \" Oh, my darling Whilelmina, do look up !\" he said. \" I am going far away from Amsterdam, and this is the last"], [37, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 27 time in this world that we shall see each other \u2014 quite the last. \u2014 Ob, Heaven ! and you cannot speak to me !\" He clasped her in his arms again, and at that moment a voice at the door of the room said,\u2014 Whilelmina began to weep. \" Oh, my dear, sweet beauty !\" said Wurtem, \" do not suffer yourself to be the victim of a false delicacy. You know that 1 love you, and that is, and ought to be, sufficient. Besides, you have on your what-do-you-call-it, you know !\" \" Oh, yes, I know ; but yet it is very dreadful !\" \" Oh, crickey ! My eyes if that ain't coming it above a bit, I don't know what is ! Simpson and Co. don't quite like such \u2014 Oh, murder !\" Wurtem Carlis snatched up a pillow, and flung it right into the face of Simp son and Co., who fell backwards, and rolled all the way down the stairs, just being in time to take old Von Straken off his legs again, as he had got about three steps up towards the floor above. \" Oh dear !\" said Whilelmina. \" It must have been dreadful if I had been a wretch, instead of your own faith ful, respectful, and attached TVurtem Carlis. Base would have been the man who would, while you were iusensible, have given you one kiss !\" \"Oh, yes.\" \" Base and foolish, too,\" added Wur tem, looking the picture of high moral courage, and rather injured innocence, from the implied suspicion of tbe fair Whilelmina. \" But tell me, beauty of the world, what was it that alarmed you ?\" \"I will tell you, Wurtem. But go away, further.\" \" Oh, yes ! Will that do ?\" \" Yes ; that will do.\" Wurtem certainly removed his arm \u2014 that arm that was around the neck of Whilelmina \u2014 about half an inch; but, of course, in the state of fright and flurry she was in, she could not know that his arm was round her neck at all, for if she had, of course she would have been dreadfully shocked, and would not have permitted it for one moment, not she. Whilelmina was virtue and modesty it self. \" She speaks !\" cried Wurtem Carlis. \"Oh, joy, she speaks! Look up, my dear love, and know me as your own Wurtem.\" \"Where am I?\" \"In your own bed, my charmer \u2014 m your own bed. Only look around you, and you will see that you are in your own bed.\" \"Ob, Cailis, and so are you!\" \"Am I? Dear me, I did not think I was. Never mind ! Cover yourself up now, my dear Whilelniina. There, I am at a respectful distance from you now.\" The respectful distance was just on the floor by the side of the bed, with his arm round the neck of Whilelmina. \" What has been the matter ?\" she said. \" You fainted, that was all. You were frightened at something, I suppose. I was, likewise, talking to your father. We heard a scream, aud 1 rushed up stairs and broke the door of your bed chamber open. I found you on the floor in a fainting condition, aud placed you on the bed. Oh, tell me that you feel better now?\" \" Wurtem,\" she said, \" there is a horrid man in the house.\" \" Your father, dear ?\" \" No, another. That is to say, I don't mean him, at all, Mr. Simpson and Co., though he is horrid enough. But there is a sailor with \u2014 oh, such eyes !\" \" Eyes r\" \" Yes. They look you through and through, aud they are so glossy. It was the eyes that frightened me, for if ever I saw anything plainly in all my life, I overheard and saw him standing at the foot of the bed, looking at me with those dreadful death-like eyes \u2014 Oh. they are horrible \u2014 most horrible !\" \" Wurtem \u2014 Wurtem?\" \"Yes, dear.\" \" I hope that while I was quite in sensible you did not presume to kiss me ?\" \" Not once, dear.\" \"Then I am satisfied. But, oh, AVurtem ! the idea of your seeing me in these garments only, and in my bed, too ! I shall never recover the shame of this night. I shall never be able to look you in the face again.\" \"The devil!\" \" I think he is really just, that. Father has given him leave to stay in the house, and he sings such strange song, and"], [38, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 28 armed himself with the poker, and put himself in an attitude of defence in the centre of the room, and then he cried\u2014 \" Rest in peace, Whilelmina. I will protect you until your worthy and ex emplary father conies to do so himself.\" The door of the chamber was opened again, for it had swung shut after Wur tem Carlis had burst the lock, and old Von Straken appeared with a carbine in his hands, and Simpson and Co. behind him with a light, which he held about a foot above the old man's head. \" There he is !\" cried Simpsom and Co. looks at one in such a way, that it makes one's flesh creep, and even now I feel as cold and shuddery as possible. \"So you do,\" said Wurtem, as he kissed the soft cheek of Whilelmina. It showed how occupied her mind was, that she took no notice whatever of his doing so, and just went on talking as before. \" Y'es, I am quite sure that he came into the room, and I screamed out, and rose from my bed to rush down stairs, but I fell to the floor, where I suppose you found me, and I had not strength enough to rise.\" \"The scoundrel!\" \" I see him !\" shouted Von Straken. Bang went the carbine, and the mortal career of Wurtem Carlis would then and there have terminated, had he not had the precaution when he saw the carbine levelled to drop to the floor, and allow the half-dozen jagged bullets with which it was loaded to fly over his head, and lodge in a mirror that hung upon the waif exactly behind him and over the chimney itself. \" Take that !\" said Von Straken. \" Oh, yes, and so ugly !\" \"Of course he is. The man who could come into the chamber of a young and innocent girl, and then begin fright ening her, deserves the severest reproba tion.\" Here Wurtem kissed Whilelmina again. \" He does, indeed, deserve reproba-> tion, Wurtem ; but everybody is not like you, you know, who can remain here so quietly, and so respectfully, and never even attempt to come near me for a moment. And yet, Wurtem, there is one thing that is more puzzling to me than the visit of that dreadful man, and that is, to think how you came at all in this house, for my father is quite impla cable in his resentment against you.\" \"That I will explain to you, dear Whilelmina. You must know \" \" Father I oh, father ! you have murdered him!' shrieked Whilelmina, making a rush out from the bed, with all the bed-clothing with her, and throwing herself right upon Wurtem Carlis. Now, indeed, poor Wurtem did run a serious risk, for Whilelmina was none of the lightest ; and the bed clothing she had brought with her covered him up entirely from the world. He could only kick, and in a smothered voice cry out\u2014 \" Murder ! murder ! Ob, help ! Mur der !\" \"Hush! hush!\" \" What is the matter, dear ?\" \"I hear some one coming. I am certain that some one or more persons are upon the stairs. As I lie here, with my head upon the pillow, I can hear more distinctly than you can, who are up, Wurtem.\" \" Can you ? Dear me, so you can.\" Wurtem laid his bead on the pillow, quite close to that of Whilelmina, and somehow or another, their faces came close together, and their lips met. \"Go away, do,\" said Whilelmina. \" Somebody is coming \u2014 oh, go away.\" Wurtem could not but, hear that some one was really coming, so as he had no wish in the world to compromise, in the smallest degree, Whilelmina, whom he really loved, he started away from the bed, and, making to the fire-place, he Von Straken let the gun drop upon the toes of Simpson and Co., and then Whilelmina, suspecting that Wurtem was not quite dead, jumped up again with a scream, ana rushed back to the bed again, with all the clothes, and was in it in a twinkling. Wurtem Carlis shook his head, and drew a long breath. \" I live again !\" he said. \" It's Wurtem !\" said Von Straken. \"But you haven't shot him,\" cried Simpson and Co. \"Confound the fel low 1 he don't seem hurt at all. Load the gun, again, Mr. Straken, do.\" \"You wretch!\" said Whilelmina, \" do you come here to commit murder ? Of course, you do \u2014 That is just what"], [39, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 29 the genius of such an ugly, horrid wretch may be supposed to amount to. Oh, I wish I could only say how much I hate you, that I do !\" \" Oh, dear !\" said Von Straken, as he sat down with a plump in the first chair he came to, that made the room shake again. \" Ob, dear ! this seems to be a very awful piece of business. I am afraid I shall not be right in my mind for a long time, in consequence of it. Was it you, my ohild, who screamed ?\" \" Yesj father, it was.\" \"And you know, Mynheer Von Straken,\" said Wurtem Carlis, putting on an injured-innocence look, \"you know that I was sitting with you in the room below, deeply enjoying your excel lent company, when we heard a scream, and then another \u2014 and then another, and then I, of course, dashed up stairs to see what was the matter.\" \" Oh \u2014 oh\u2014 oh !\" said Mynheer Von Straken, \" I am afraid my principal troubles in this life are only just begin ning, and that I have been, up to now, a great deal too happy and comfortable. That is what I am afraid of now !\" \" Well,\" said Simpson and Co., \" I never had such a knock-down blow be fore. It looked like a pillow that came against me, but it felt more like a can non shot ; aud here I am with my nose bleeding.\" \" I should have thought,\" said Wur tem Carlis, \" thet your head was hard enough even to have resisted a cannon shot.\" \"Should you?\" \" Yes ; or, perhaps, it has gone to the other extreme, and got so soft that the slightest thing will make a serious im pression upon it.\" \" I don't want to hear anything that you have to say,\" said Simpson and Co. \"I daresay your bill would not be dis counted in London or Amsterdam ; and if such is the case, of course, you must be a very disreputable person.\" \" Don't quarrel,\" said Von Straken. \"Don't quarrel \u2014 it's no use, that, at ail ; but come with me, both of you, and let us see if the mysterious sailor is still iu the house. It may be that Whilel mina has had a bad dream.\" \"Yes,\" added Whilelmina, \"and I fliink the horrid sailor with the strange eyes was in my room, and Wurtem Carlis coming, frightened him away!\" \"And here,\" added Wurtem, \" I stood ever since with the poke1- in my hand, waiting for you, Mynheer Von Straken.\" The old merchant groaned. \"Yes,\" said Simpson and Co., \"but some one threw something at me, and made my no6e bleed.\" \"Oh, no\u2014 no !\" said 'Whilelmina, from beneath the bed-clolhes. Wurtem Carlis made two steps to wards the bed. \" Stop,\" said Von Straken. \" I was \u2014 only \u2014 that is, I was afraid that Whilelmina was being smothered, you see, Mynheer Von Straken, among the bed-clothes.\" CHAPTER IX. THE TERRORS OF THE NIGHT ARE NOT QUITE OVER. Poor Von Straken ! never had he been so thoroughly perplexed before \u2014 never had he been so completely unable to come to a conclusion upon affairs in general, and the desturbances in his own household in particular, as now. Each hour seemed only to add to his bewil dered condition. The old merchant waved his hand majestically, \" Let her smother,\" he said, and then he led the way from the room. Wurtem Carlis was obliged to follow him, but Whilelmina managed to poke one hand out from the mass of bed clothes, and waved it in signal of adieu to him. Von Straken then closed the broken door, as well as he could, and turning to the two young men, he said, solemnly \u2014 \" You will both come with me to that portion of the house which for so many years has been uninhabited. If we find it uninhabited still, all will be well ; but if He looked hopelessly in the face of Wurtem Carlis for an explanation, but he foundnothing fortunately to enlighten him there. Then he looked iu the face of Whilelmina, but as she thought she had said quite enough, she covered her self up with the bed-clothes, and was determined not to be questioned fur ther."], [40, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 30 he is still there whom I gave the liberty to sleep there, my perplexities will still remain. Come along.\" \"But who is be'1.\" said Wurtem Carlis. business.\u2014 Oh, yes, the times are very bad, indeed !\" \" Do you meau me, sir ?\" said Simp son and Co. \" Yes.\" \" Oh, you do, do you ? Very well, sir. Then I can tell you, no doubt to your great fear and discomfiture, if you mean me, that \" \u00ab \" Well, sir ?\" \" That, I despise you too much to take any further notice of it, and that if you were to abuse me ever so, I would only take the law of you, and if 1 couldn't do that, I would treat you with silent con tempt.\" By the time Simpson and Co. had de livered himself of this not, very valorous speech, the merchant had reached the door of the chamber in which he had placed his very mysterious guest. He knocked at it gently. \"Who knocks ?\" said a voice. The merchant only groaned. \" The deuce only knows who he is,\" said Simpson and Co. \" All I can say of him is that he is about as unwelcome here as somebody else I could name. Oh, you needn't look fierce, Mr. Carlis ; 1 know you and have heard of you be fore, aud I would just ask you how much you can lay down in hard cash?\" Wurtem cast a contemptuous glance upon the mercenary lover of Whilel mina, and followed the merchant. Simp son and Co. fell back, aud as he did so, he shook his fists menacingly at Wur tcm Carlis, and made motions as though he were milling that petsonage at a great rate behind his back; but he- took good care not to touch him, although at times he came within a hair's breadth of him. \" Meine Got ! he is there !\" said Von Shaken. The merchant led the way along the same gloomy portion of the house that he had taken the shipwrecked sailor some hours before. \" Hush !\" said Wurtem, \"he is sing ing.\" They all listened, and they heard the shipwrecked man singing in his low, wailing, plaintive, and vet exquisitely musical voice, the followiug lines : \u2014 The object of Von Straken was really to ascertain if the mysterious guest had quitted his house or not, or if he were wandering about it ; for although the fright that Whilelmina had exhibited might very well be the result of a dream, yet he. could not take upon himself to say that it was such. \" The red sun is setting, The night comes amain ; The tears .-if the lost one Are falling like rain. But Heaven, in its mercy, May still make him blest, And the Phantom will gently Then sink to his rest. \" Come on,\" he said to the two ycung nieu. \" Come on, and don't quarrel, I beg of you. This is no time for quarrel ling. Alas! alas! we live in fearful times, indeed.\" \" 1 don't know that,\" said Simpson and Co. \"Exports are lively, and tallow is rising. Butter slides off quickly, and bottled-beer is brisk; so I cannot see, myself, but that the times are as good times as need be.\" \"I differ from you,\" said Wurtem C.irlis, iii a melancholy voice. \"The times are bad. Honesty is at a discount. Purse- proud arrogance and stupiditv sti)lk about now. An idiot, with a good round sum at his bankers, is preferred to a man of sense and judgment with no banker at all.

Conic away, both of vou. Oh, come away ! Conic\u2014 come. I am au unhappy man. Never take fair girls in barter for your heart's best treasure.

Then turning to Wurtem Carlis, he said \u2014 \"Wurtem, go!\" \" Oh, Mynheer, I have not yet told you why I came here.\" \" Go now, but remain near to the window. When I want you, 1 will tap for you against the casement, for 1 may want you.

Oh, go on.\" \" You have done what you could to night for me and my child, and in the morning, if you go to SwaghenhauSsen and Co., the bankers, you shall receive fifty guilders.

Oh, you won't think of such a thing.\" \" I have said it,\" replied Von Stra ken, \" and the word of Von Straken is as his bill or his bond. If I had said one thousand guilders, they would have been paid to the order of Wurtem Carlis on the morrow.\" as it would have been my pride to have ever obeyed you like a son, if I had had the felicity of wedding the fair \" \" Be off !\" cried Simpson and Co. \" Whilelmina,\" added Wurtem Carlis, as he walked out of the room quite heedless of the indignation of his rival. \" Confound that fellow !\" cried Simp son and Co. \"He has the impudence of the very deuce, himself ; and 1 only wish he would break his neck over the door step, or fall over one of the quays, and get drowned, that I do ; or, indeed, he may come to any other bad end, for all I care, as long as it was an end ! That's what I look to.\" \"Mynheer Simpson and Co.,\" said Von Straken. \" Yes, sir ; here you are.\" \" Take one chair.\" \" Very good. Thank you, Von Stra ken. All 1 can say is, that I would rather be in bed ; for, to tell the truth, I ain't at all used to being disturbed in the night, and I don't much like it. Comfort is next to business.\" \"Mynheer.\" \" Well, sir, I am listening. What do you want to say ?\" \" You think of marrying Whilelmina ?\" \" Why, yes, I certainly have thought of it, and I believe, rather, that 'tis all settled that the Houses of Simpson and Co. and of Von Straken are to go into partnership, aud that the union is to be cemented by my union with the fair Whilelmina. Here I am, a goodish way from Newgate Street, on that very ac count, and I can only assure you that I am rather missed in the City, that's a fact.\" \" Oh, he's mad ! mad !\" cried Simp son and Co. \" To give away fifty guil ders !

Dear \u2014 dear, this will never do ! It's enough to drive anybody out of their wits to think of it.\" Von Straken reached out his large, bony hand, and grasped the arm of young Simpson and Co. with it. \" Listen,\" he said. \" You think me rich, but I am twenty times as rich as you think me. You think that by mine capital, 1 can drive a good export and import trade ; but I can have fifty ships to one that I now have, if 1 like. 1 could nearly buy Amsterdam, that I could.\" \" Oh, my dear sir !\" \" Hush !

Do you j hear?\" CHAPTER X. THE STOKil OVER AMSTERDAM. Aetek this refusal upon the part of Simpson and Co., for the very cogent reasons urged to cut the \" troat,\" as Von Straken called it, of his mysterious guest above-stairs, there was a silence of some few moments' duration between the marchant and his intended son-in-law. It was broken by the old man. \" Bather, but really you have a funny way of complimenting a fellow, I must confess !\" \" Never you mind that. Compliment or no compliment, you listen to me. J You say you would do anything and i everything to win my Whilelmina?\" \"1 would!\" \" Ha\u2014 ha ! * he said. \" Ha\u2014 ha !\" This was a forced laugh upon the part of Von Straken, and it very nearly had the effect of choking him outright, for it brought ou an attack of coughing that made him turn quite blue in the face, and if Simpson and Co. had not been there, and banged him on the back, there is no knowing what the result might have been. \" Are you better now ?\" said Simp son and Co. \" Then there is only one little thing j that I would have you do, that is \u2014 that \u00bb> i is \" Well, what ?\" \" Oh, if I only thought you would do it !' \" I will\u2014 that's flat !\" \" What is flat, meiue Got V \" I mean, it's a settled thing that I will do it.

Those who take oaths lightly, break them lightly, and therefore it is that I like to know beforehand what it is that I am to swear to.\" Von Straken rose, and approaching the window, he tapped at it with the stem of his pipe, several times. \" He has gone !\" gasped out Mynheer Von Straken. \"He has gone !\" For the first time in his life, the rich old merchant felt a pang to his very heart at the idea that Carlis had gone. How little did he ever expect to feel such a pang ! Circumstances had sadly changed with Mynheer Von Straken. As is too often the case, however, the merchant suffered but from a delusion, for the young man had not gone. Wur tem Carlis was in no hurry to go from the house that contained Whilelmina. It would not have required much persua sion to induced him to linger there UDtil the morning. He had heard the merchant's tap at the casement with the stem of his pipe, and the reason he made no reply to it, simply was, that he was too anxious to obey the summons, and started off to the door again, with out leaving himself time to reply in any way to the tap upon the casement. Von Straken had just sunk into his chair, in utter despair at the idea that the only man upon whom he thought he could now depend to take the life of the horrid and mysterious man above stairs was gone, when Wurtem Carlis entered the room in full haste, crying out as he did so \u2014 \" Right. He is right,\" muttered the old merchant. \" The oath, then, Wurtem Carlis, is only that you will not, without my consent, repeat what 1 am now going to tell you.\" \" That I will swear to at once.\" \" You do swear it ?* \" I do. So help me heaven, I will keep your confidence aud secret from all the world.\" \" I think you wjll \u2014 I know you will, and therefore, Wurtem Carlis, I will make a great confidence with you \u2014 I who never thought to address another word to you, or if I did, that it would surely be one spoken in anger.\" \" It is a blessed change, Mynheer.\" \" Perhaps it is, and perhaps it is not.

The condition of it is, that if there should be any obsta cles in the way of the marriage, he can olaim of me all I am worth, with the exception of one guilder. Alas !

Of course tbe mysterious man up stairs cannot make you respon sible for the elopement of Whilelmina, and as for Simpson and Co., he is such an idiot that it does not matter at all what he thinks or what he says about the affair.\" Von Straken thought it would be highly proper to smoothen his feeling3 down a little, and conciliate him. \"My excellent Wurtem Carlis,\" he said. \" I do not wonder that you made such a mistake. I, if I had been in your situation, even I might have made it ; so be comforted.

Indeed, when you come to be my age, you will think it a great deal better. You shall have money.\" \" Money ! And do you think, Mynheer Von Straken, that I value money as placed in competition with my own dear Whilelmina? No, Mynheer !

Wurtem Carlis rose. \" Von Straken,\" he said, \" what did you ever see in my speech or conduct that could induce you to think I would be guilty of such a deed ? Do you take me for an assassin ? Do you think that because a man is poor that he can be hired to cut a throat by any one who will say, ' Here is payment for your trouble and your crime ?' Oh, Von Straken\u2014 Von Straken ! wealth has indeed vitiated your mind, and made you something scarcely human 1\" \"Pose!\" Under any other circumstances,Whil elmina, we do think, would not have played tbe part of a spy upon her father's private conferences with any one; but in the present instance, the feeling to do so was irresistible, so she did it, and we hope the candid reader will excuse her. The merchant was rather chagrind at hearing Wurten Carlis's very un-Dutch like notions about money; but after a few moments' consideration, he made up his mind that it was merely talk, and that if he offered anything definite to the very poor young man, the temptation would be too great for him to resist at all. \" You have spoken,\" he said, \" and now I will speak. If you will do what I shall ask of you freely, I will give you the command of my ship the Jang Frau, and you shall have five hundred guilders to make an addition to her cargo yourself, and you will soon be a rich man.\" \"You may disregard what I say, but I will still speak to you ; out of the pure love that I bear for Whilelmina, I will speak to you, and offer you such advico in the present state of your mind as you ought to have.

And now I will give you a word or two of advice. As yet you may have done many things that it would have been better you had left undone. But oh, Mynheer ! better far will it be for you to walk forth into the City without a guilder that you can call your own, than that you should stain your soul with that worst of crimes, murder !\" \" Pose !\" \" The Jang Fran, they say, is leaky,\" said Wurtem drily, \" and that she is not worth repairs. There's not a captain in all Amsterdam will go out in her !\" \"Then,\" said the merchant, some what confused at Wurtem's knowledge of the very unseaworthiness of the Jang Frau, \"you shall have the Isabel !\" \" That is worse,\" said Wurtem. \" She has been in dry-dock for two years, and, they say, is in a sad condi tion. You are offering me the worn-out ships that you ought to break up.\" \" Meine Got, no 1 Break up the Isabel ! Oh, no. Did you never see her bottom V Wurtem shook his head. \" You may say pose ! but the time will come when you will recollect this advice that I now give you, and perhaps be grateful for it.\" \"No I won't.\" \" Good-night, Von Straken. I leave you to your own thoughts.\" The young man at once left the room, and the bang of the outer door shotting convinced Von Straken that he bad left the house. \"Then you shall!\" \" How can they talk so !\" whimpered Whilelmina. \"Now,\" added Von Straken, \"all I want you to do for what 1 offer you, is to cut his troat !\" \" He is gone,\" whispered the old merchant. \" He is gone, and he knows that I contemplated a murder. Will he tell ? No \u2014 no. His oath will be sacred with him.

The troat of the man who gave me the jewels, and who now is the only enemy I have in all the world and Holland. That, mine excellent young friend, is all I wish you to do for me.

Every moment the resolution to do it himself grew upon him. He could not quite convince himself that the myste rious being who was in the room above was not mortal. To be sure, the dread idea that it was no other than Van derdecken, the Flying Dutchman, was present in the mind of Von Straken ; but he would not believe it now, although if he had not found it to his interest to take the life of the mysterious man, he would have found no difficulty in at once declaring that Vanderdecken it was and no other, to all intents and purposes. We are all very slow to believe what we don't like. \" No \u2014 no, he is only a sailor, who has by some accident lit upon a vast treasure, and so wants to marry into the richest family in Amsterdam, upon the strength of it, that is all ; and the best thing that can be done, is to put him out of the world. Besides, I daresay he did not come by the jewels honestly.\" How ingenious, for once in his li'e, Van Straken was, in persuading himself that there were other reasons besides his own cupidity and his own evil passions for putting his guest to death ! Surely the schnops had done fearful damage that night to the brain of the worthy and wealthy Mynheer Von Straken. The light went out. \"Help!\" cried Von Straken. \"A light \u2014 a light ! I don't like to be in the dark now. Who will bring me a light ?\" He ceased speaking, for he all of a sudden recollected that everybody in the house had gone to bed, and that it was of no use his calling to them. And, besides, if he should succeed in waken ing them up, nothing could be very well further from his intentions than to have any witnesses of what he was going to be at upon that eventful night. '.' No \u2014 no. I don't want anybody. I can get a light myself,\" he muttered. \" The kitchen fire will not be out, and I can easily get a light myself, I am certain of that. I will go \u2014 1 will go.\" Von Straken was right when he sur mised that the kitchen fire would be in, for, iu truth, for the whole year round it was never let our. as the servants had a mode of making it up at night, so that it was just, in the morning, in guQh a rather a terse description of himself, but he thought it was just as well left alone. He again heard the thunder in the distance, and the light that he had was evidently upon the wane. \"What shall I do? What shall I do ?\" he said. \" How can I face him in the morning, and either say to him ' My child shall be yours,' or ' My child shall not be yours ?' My Whilelmina or my money ! Oh, dear, I love both, but 1 don't know which I love the best, quite. Oh, yes, I do \u2014 I love my child better than the guilders ; and yet \u2014 yet my money is all the world to me. Ah yes, I think I love my money the best I\" Whilelmina, with the tears streaming from her eyes, when she heard these words, slowly took her way back to her own chamber. She had not the heart to listen to any more. \" There is no one,\" she said, \" in all the world who loves me truly but poor Wurtem Carlis. He does, indeed, love as I wish to be loved. Dear \u2014 dear Wurtem ! He loves me better than all the gold in the world. He said so, and I believe him. I will not be auy one's but his. Bless him ! Dear \u2014 dear Wur tem Carlis, if he had only a little money, so that my father could be tempted to give his consent, I might be happy.\" The old merchant little suspected that Whilelmina had been an auditor of his selfish speech. \"Ah!\" he said, \"I don't know, either, though. Whilelmina is a nice girl, and a good girl. But guilders buy all men \u2014 no \u2014 no \u2014 they won't buy Wur tem Carlis \u2014 He won't kill the sailor, and so rid me of that pest \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 incubus upon my peace !

No \u2014 no 1\" Poor Von Straken sat in a brown study. \" I must do it, myself,\" he said, in a whisper. \" I shall have to do it myself. Simpson and Co, won't do it from fear, and Wurtem Carlis will not do it from virtue \u2014 I must, do it\u2014 I must do it mine own self !\" This was a wise determination of the wer pWi It was iwt very likely he would"], [49, "E it THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 39 state that a very little trouble would suffice to rouse it, into a flame. The merchant made his way into the kitchen for the first time for years ; as, of course, such a rich man as Mynheer Von Straken despised the kitchen very much indeed. But crime and its conse quences, whether before or after its actual commission, make strange altera tions in people's actions and their manner of thinking ; so Von Straken found his way to the kitchen, and lit a small oil lamp that could be conveniently catried. \"This will do,\" he said. \"Meine Got, this will do nicely. I will do it mineself, and get rid for ever of that dreadful man. Yes, this is the time j,to do it.\" Bang ! went another peal of thunder over Amsterdam, and it would seem as if it chose the space just above Von Straken's house in which to go off, as it were, for the old building was shaken to its foundation by the stunning report. Whirsh ! came down the rain now, and the merchant could hear it pouring upon the roof, while the wind began to howl and dash past the old latticed win dows in an awful manner. CHAPTER XII. THE MYSTERIOUS OLD CHEST. It was not for long, though, that the storm continued to have any remarkable effect upon the spirits of the merchant. He was sufficiently familiar with storms at tbat time of the year to have heard all he now heard with perfect equanimity, had it not been that be knew he was going upon an errand that he could not justify to his conscience. That was what made the storm to him appalling. Truly might Von Straken, if he had known the lines, which he certainly did not, have exclaimed\u2014 \" Thrice 13 he armed who hath his quarrel just, And be bat naked, though locked up iu steel. Whose conscience with inj ustice is corrupted ;* for it was the wicked act that he con templated that armed the thunder with power to shake his heart. But, as we have said, it was not for long that the merchant allowed himself and his fell purpose to be so beaten down. Men's passions will triumph over such difficulties; and although the wind howled, and the rain came down like a second deluge, and now and then he could hear the muttered growl of the thunder, he still crept on towards his purpose. It did not occur to Von Straken for a little while that he had no weapon with which to carry out his murderous design ; but the moment it did so occur to him, he paused to think what would be the most suitable. \" What shall it be ?\" he said, \" wbat shall it be ? Shall I shoot him ? No no, that would make too much noise by a vast deal. I must look and consider.\" What a night this is,\" said the mer chant. He stood for some few minutes in the kitchen, trembling and listening to the storm without ; and more than once he thought he heard a strange wailing voice cry in strange unearthly accents, that struck terror into the soul\u2014 \" Van \u2014 der \u2014 decken ! Oh ! Vander decken ! Oh!\" The merchant shook so, that he quite spilled the oil out of the hand-lamp, for he got into quite an agony of fear now, as this unearthly voice came upon the storm. He could not, although he tried hard to do so, persuade himself that it was only his imagination that made him fancy he heard such a sound. It came again. \" Diderich Van \u2014 der \u2014 decken ! Ho ! Von Straken took his way to a little room, facing the street, in which there was a curious assemblage of articles. The captains of his ships had from time to time brought him strange things from different parts of the world. There were shells \u2014 minerals \u2014 Indiandresses \u2014 warlike utensils, and a variety of odds and ends, that were all placed in that one room, and gave it very much the aspect of a museum that had been well shaken. That \" Ho !\" died away so in the dis tance, that it seemed to him lengthened indefinitely. Von Straken staggered to a large wooden chair in the kitchen, and sitting down upon it, he ejaculated,\u2014 \" The Saints preserve me ! Oh, have meicy upon me! \u2014 Have mercy upon me !\" As Von Straken held up his lamp in this room, and glanced around him, his eyes fell full upon a hideous carved idol that had been brought from the South"], [50, "Vanderdecken. 40 Sea Islands, and at the moment he was so alarmed, that he started back witn an exclamation. A moment's thought was sufficient to remind Von Straken of what this was, and although he still shook very much, he advanced into the room, muttering \u2014 \u25a0' I am one fool, for things frighten me now that I have looked at a hundred times, without being frightened at all at. Meine Got, I am not so strong as I was. No.\" the lock of the door. It yielded to him in a moment, and then the door opened a little way, without making any noise whatever. Von Straken was just able to peep into the room, and then he saw what in- duced him to pause a little while, before he continued his enterprise. There was in the room a strange, white kind of light, and it all seemed to come from a particular spot, and when the eyes of Von Straken were bent upon that spot, he saw\u2014 oh ! ravishing sight !\u2014 a diamond, about tbe size of an egg, placed upon tbe ledge of the chimney-piece, and it seemed to send out from every point of its dazzling surface, millions of little rays of light of the most dazzling description ! Never had the merchant heard of such a diamond as that. In comparison with the few celebrated diamonds m t he world, and which were worth such large sums, what was the value of this ? The world's wealth would not purchase it ! It was truly magnificently beautiful, and as Von Straken gazed upon it he was dazzled by the long silvery rays of light that darted from it, aud crossed and crossed each other in all directions, and he quite forgot that he had come there to commit a murder. Slowly casting his eyes from one object to another, Von Straken at length saw an Indian war-hatchet, with a long handle of some hard wood. \" This will do,\" he said. It was an odd thing to see the cor- pulent Dutch merchant in his most feaceful-looking costume, with the war- hatchet of an Indian chief in one hand, and tbe lamp in the other. \" This will do,\" he said. \" Meine Got, yes, I will send that sailor to the other world, where he will be better off then he is here, and where he will be out of my way, whether he is better off or not. Yes, I will settle with him to-night, and all will be quite right again.\" Oh, foolish Von Straken ! How can you fancy, that when the affairs of a man are a little wrong, or even a great deal wrong, that a crime is the thing that will put them right again? Slowly, now, and treading as softly as his ponderous weight would permit him to do, he took his way to the stranger's chamber, full of the most murderous intentions towards him. The thunder had now entirely ceased, and had given place to the rain, which deluged Amster dam, and the wind which swept through its streets, so that the tempest had not by any means so terrible a character to guilty souls. And now Von Straken has reached the door of the chamber, and there he stops, and pauses to listen if he can make out anything that is passing within. He hoped that his intended victim would be sleeping. \"I don't hear him,\" said Von Straken; \"I don't hear anythng. There is not the smallest sound here, now. Where can he be ? \u2014 Has he gone ?\" This idea was so distiessing to Von Straken, that he could not endure it for long, but he gently laid his hand upon It was with difficulty that he took his eyes off the resplendent gem, and, per haps, if he had not heard a slight noise in the room, he would not have been able to do so at all ; but that noise aroused him, and upon looking in the direction from whence it came, he saw his myste rious guest. The strange unearthly man had drawn from a corner of the room a huge chest, which for many years had been lying there rotting, and which no one would touch, because it was believed to contain wearing apparel and other personal property that had belonged to Vander decken, when many years ago, he had inhabited that house. The only occasion upon which Von Straken had ever looked at it, had been one when he thought of selling it and its contents, but upon a cursory exami nation he had found nothing of much value, so he had, to avoid the matter being talked about, left it alone. The mysterious man was upon his knees by this box, the lid of which was"], [51, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHM 41 wide open, and he was taking out the contents one by one. His manner, as he did so, was remarkable and striking. Von Straken's guest did no speak for some time as he took the things from the box, but at limes he would frantically kiss some of the garments, and others he would hold to his heart as though they \"brought to him the most precious recollections. Von Straken could see WHILELMINA SEEKS VANDEIIDECKEN IN THE CHEST, EOT FINDS IT EMPTY. that the clothing that so much affected him, were children's, and that others he passed by without any particular notice. At length, the box was, to all appear ance, empty; but then the mysterious man touched the bottom of it in a pecu- , liar way, and out he lifted a false bottom, the existence of which Von Straken had never suspected. From underneath that he brought out some little miniatures, and then with a strange and frightful cry, he began to sob and kiss them. No. 6."], [52, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 42 \"My children \u2014 my dear children !\" he said. \" These are the miniatures I had made of you all, to take with me upon my last voyage, but they were left be hind. If I had had them, I think 1 sliould have been saved. My dear \u2014 dear children ! God bless you all. Alas ! alas !\" there came a strange, startling whisper in the room ilself, and it said \u2014 \" Vanderdecken !\" Von Straken clasped his hands to gether, and tried to recollect some old prayer that had once been familiar to his lips when au infant, but the effort was all in vain. He wrung his hands, and wept, and kissed the miniatures over and over again, aud then he cried \u2014 \" Enough \u2014 enough,\" said Vander decken. \" I obey the call. I come \u2014 I come. I will meet you now.\" That Vanderdecken, concerning whose identity there could be now no possibility of doubt, would, in passing out of the room, tumble over him. Von Straken, at the door, was the merchant's dominant idea, and it got up in his mind a feeling of such absolute desperation that he was able, in defiance of all his fear, to cry out, \u2014 \"All dead \u2014 all dead long ago, and here am I ! Here am I still, and they are all dead. Oh, God \u2014 oh, God! How Ion? ?\" Von Straken slowly placed the little Indian hatchet against the wall by the door. \" No,\" he gasped. \" No, I cannot kill him. Oh, dear, no \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 that is, 1 cannot do it.\" \" Mercy ! Oh, have mercy upon me, and leave me my money and my child ! Have mercy upon me !\" \" Ah !\" cried Vanderdecken, and he strode up to the door and dashed it open. \" Yes,\" interrupted the mysterious man, \" they are all dead long ago, aud had ceased to think of me. Oh, when wili this dreadful state end ? Oh, Heaven have mercy upon me ! Hush ! Yes. The voice \u2014 I hear it now on the roaring blast. I am called \" Von Straken fell into the room on his hands and knees. \" Have mercy upon me, Diderich Vande.'decken,\" he said. \"I know you now. I thought it was you before, but now I know it. Do not kill me body and soul. Give me some time to repent, and, oh, spare my child, and my money 1\" Vanderdecken looked at him in silence. \" Van \u2014 der \u2014 decken, ho !\" said a voice that sounded as if it were far off. Von Stracken felt Ihe perspiration standing in large drops upon his face, as terror knocked loudly at his heart. \" Yes, I am called\u2014 I am called, and I will obey the summons quickly. It is no delusion : I heard the voice in the blast of the night wind.\" \"Yes, I am sure you will,\" added Von Straken. \" What is money to you ? Nothing, absolutely nothing. What is a young and tender maid to you ? No\u00bb thing, absolutely nothing. Oh, Vander decken, you had children of your own, and in their name, I ask of you to be merciful to mine.\" \" Van \u2014 der \u2014 decken, ho !\" \"There again. I come \u2014 I come !\" Von Straken fell upon his knees, for he had no idea but that Vanderdecken would come out of the room and see him ; and as for running away from the spot, he was in that state of terror, that he could no more have descended the stairs than he could have flown over the house. Vanderdecken did not speak, but he fixed his glossy eyes upon the merchant in such a way, that the latter felt fascin ated as though by the glance of a serpent ; he could neither move nor speak, nor for one instant withdraw his glance from the eyes of Vanderdecken. Poor Van Straken, too, was still upon his hands and knees, and he looked like some great stranded fish or unknown animal that for the first time found himself face to face with a man. Vanderdecken made no answer. \" Call me the third time, and I come,\" said Vanderdecken. \" You have ever called me thrice, so that I might not be deceived by other sounds. Call me again, oh, invisible spirit, and I come.\" There was an awful stillness. The wind seemed suddenly to drop, and the rain to be suspended in mid-air. You might, have heard a pin drop in the merchant's house; and then suddenly"], [53, "THE FLYINO DUTCHMAN. 43 \" Oh, spare me,\" added Von Straken. \"|You have such a large diamond, too, I that you might buy your way to the I throne of Holland easily. What use is | it to you ? Oh, Vanderdecken, I never I did any harm to you, and why should you grudge me the few jewels that you gave me years ago ? You cannot want roy child in exchange for them, surely. Be- sides, you have seen that there is the highly respectable Simpson and Co. that I have pledged myself fo give hcr to.\" j Vanderdecken moved slowly towards the great chest that was open, and now completely empty. He turned not for I a moment from gazing at Vou Straken, who still felt the influence of that strange and frightful gaze, and quiled beneath it. It was evidently solely by a sort of instinct that Vanderdecken reached the chest, for he did not once look at it, and now he placed his hand upon the lid. Von Straken was lost in amazement as to what he was going to do, but the idea struck him that if he offered him the chest and all its contents, it might mollify him a little. \" That chest came to my grandfather along with the house,\" he said, \" when he bought it ; but you are as welcome to it, Vanderdecken, as tulips in June. It is yours and all within it.\" Vanderdecken, to the amazement of Von Stracken, stepped into the chest, and crouching down, he was completely within it. The lid suddenly came down with a clap like the discharge of a can- non, and Von Straken rolled back on the floor. result of this was, that in the course of a few minutes everybody in the house was up, of course including the fair Whilelmina. There was a grand rush to the mer chant's own room, but a very slight ex amination of that was sufficient to con vince everyone that he had not slept in his bed that night. There were the two huge feather beds, between which it is the habit of a Dutchman to repose him self, quite smooth, and evidently un touched by any one ; and Whilelmina at once, then, started the idea that her father must be with the mysterious stranger in the room that had been for so long a period of time uninhabited. \" Go, all of you,\" she said, \"and see if anything is amiss. It is not right that I should go to that apart ment; but if none of you will, 1 must do so.\" Thus urged, the servants, partly actuated by shame at exhibiting cow ardice so unquestionably in the mat ter, and partly from fear of, in the morning, losing so good a place as Mynheer Von Straken's was, went in a body to that dismal and unfrequented part of the house. It is rather a sad thing that a house, or a portion of a house, cannot be shut up for a time in any city of Europe, even London included, without acquiring a supernatural superstition. Of course, this long-deserted portion of Von Straken's residence had such a character, although in that one instance probably it was far better justified than in (he vast majority. Full of dread, then, at what they might see and hear when they got there, the domestics rushed to the door of the large chamber in which they knew that the mysterious stranger had been lodged. \"You go first, Carl,\" said one. \" You are a huge man, and if there; should be any danger, you will best face it.\" CHAPTEB XIII. THE STEANGE MEETING IN THE CAVEENS Or THE DEEP. The consternation of old Von Stra ken was so great at this strange disap pearance of the spectre, for such he be gan to consider his strange guest to be in the huge chest, that he lay upon the floor without sense or motion. His fall, however, had had such an effect upon the h\u00bbuse, old and substan tial as it was, that it had shaken it to its very foundation, and thoroughly alarmed everyone tvho were iu it. The \" Meine Got I\" cried Carl, \"that is the very reason why I should not go first. If there is danger, it will kill me at once,'owiug to it not being able to miss me on account of my si?e. Now, there is Hans !\" \" Me ?'* cried Hans. '\u25a0' Oh, no\u2014 no.\" \" Ses,\" continued Carl, puffing and"], [54, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 44 else vou would be mischievous, I am blowing like a stranded grampus, as he spoke. \" Yes, Hans is so little that he is the very person, of all others, to go upon such an enterprise. If, whon the door is opened, anything should bounce out suddenly, it will be sure to go over his head.\" \" No \u2014 no !\" cried Hans, more ener getically than before. \" I don't mind confessing to you all, as we are friends and fellow servants, that I never have much courage at the best of times, and that under such horrid circumstances as this, I have none at all.\" sure.\" \"Only waif, (ill I have an oppor tunity,\" growled Carl, \" and if I don't fall over you, and crush you, my name is not Carl, that's all. What say, my good friends : Shall I call upon our respected master by name, to know if he is in this room ?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes,\" cried every one. \" Then I will. Hem ! Mynheer Von Straken, if you are within this room, be so good as to say so ; and if you are not, don't speak.\" \" That's correct,\" said everybody. The only response to this was a deep groan from the interior of the chamber; but it so alarmed the party, that they all were upon the point of making a preci pitate retreat, when the voice of Whilel mina below, shamed them into more active measures. \" What a coward !\" cried every body. \"It's the melancholy truth,\" said Hans. \" I was frightened when I was a babby, and I have never got over it since.\" The servants looked at each other in dismay, and then, with one accord, they turned to Carl. \" Have you found my father ?\" she said. \" Oh, where is lie ?\" \"Push the door open, Carl,\" cried several. \" Push it open.\" They drove Carl ou by various pinches and kicks, until, to escape the infliction that he was suffering, he thought it best to make a vigorous effort to open the door, and he accordingly did, and he got it open about six or eight inches aud thrust his nose in at the aperture. \" Master,\" he said. \" Ob, murder ! Help ! \u2014 I'm a dead man !\" Now the fact is, that Mynheer Von Straken had rolled on to the floor, and had just recovered sufficiently to sit there with his back against the door of tbe room, which held it shut, although in his consternation he had no sort of perception that such was the position he occupied. When Carl pushed the door, there fore, he had pushed it against Mynheer Von Straken, and that accounted for the odd sort of resistance he had met with in opening it, and the merchant made sure it was some supernatural being making an attack upon him. But when Carl made the last vigorous effort, the merchant had bent forward a little, so that, as we have said, Carl was able to get his nose into the room ; but as Von Straken leant back again, bang went the door shut upon that prominent feature of Carl, to its very great damage. In deed, he had infinite difficulty in extri- \" You must go,\" they said. \" There is no help for it ; you are the biggest, so you must go.\" Carl groaned, but, as the others said, there was no help for it. To be sure, he might have turned, and actually fled, but then he had grown sleek and fat in the service of the merchant, and the idea of getting his discharge was so fearful a one, that he felt, coward as he was, he would rather face the devil him self. \" If I must \u2014 I must,\" said Car', trying, with the best grace he could, to make a virtue of necessity, \" and 1 call you all to witness that it is out of attachment to the best of masters that I go.\" \" Oh, that will do\u2014 that will do !\" cried everybody. Upon this, Carl gave the door a push. It was quite evident that something held it shut in the inside ; and the most remarkable thing was, that when it was pushed it yielded a little, and then closed again with a sharp clap, that made them all jump. \" This his horrible !\" said Carl, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow with the skirt ot his coat. \" I don't see anything horrible in it,\" said Hans, who had rushed quite half way down stairs. \" All that you want is courage. Carl, you are like a cow \u2014 \u25a0 you don't know your own strength, or"], [55, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 45 eating if, in a very dilapidated condl tion. \" Love !\" \" Oh, 1 beg your pardon. You don't know what that means.\" Such, (hen, was the cause of the outcry that he made, and which scared, at once, all the servants to the loot of the stairs. Whilelmina was there, and finding that they had not courage to go to her father's rescue, in case he really needed any assistance, she began the ascent of the stairs herself, calling out as she did so\u2014 \u25a0 \"Father \u2014 father! Where are you ? Speak to me, and let me know that you live !\" \" We certainly don't deal in that article in Newgate Street ; and I never knew any of the firm keep that article in stock. But do you mean to say that you won't carry out the little partnership affair of Simpson, Von Straken and Co., merchants and exporters, eh ?\" \" Do not speak to me. I have no words for you.\" Whilelmina went to the door of the mysterious room, and rapped at it. \"Who is there?\" said Von Straken, in a dolorous voice. \" Ob, I dare say he's all right,\" said a voice upon the landing. That voice belonged to Simpson and Co. \" If you are a man,\" said Whilelmina, \" go to the rescue of my father. I only shrink myself from doing so because that I am a girl, and feel a dread of going into the apartment that has been devoted to the use of the shipwrecked sailor.\" \" Why \u2014 a-hem ! that is to say, I am as bold as a lion when there is a proper occasion. Lord bless you ! father and I, and our two clerks, aud our three por ters, turned out of our counting-house in Newgate Street once a man who wasn't able to pay us our bill, and came to ask us to let him off for a year or two, that we did. As to courage, therefore, I take it, Miss Straken, that is a pretty good proof. The man was very ill, and hardly able to move, but we bundled him out.\" \" It is I, father.\" \" Mine child, Whilelmina ?\" \"Oh, yes, father. Open the door. Are you well ? How rejoiced I am to hear you speak at all ! Tell me what has happened to you, dear father !\" \" Oh, mine child ! oh, mine child '.\" \"What is it that grieves you, father ? Why do you not come out of this cham ber to me ? What is it that holds the door?\" \" Holds the door ?\" \"Yes; it will not open. How is that ?\" \" Meine Got ! I don't know ! Give it one push, mine ehild !\" Whilelmina did so, and gave Mynheer Von Straken a sharp rap on the back of the head with it. That seemed to have the effect of arousing him to the real state of affairs; and after glancing around him, he saw, by the dim light of the oil lamp that was burning in the room, that he was sitting so close to the door, that it was physically impossible for any one to open it. \"Stop\u2014 stop!\" he cried \" Yes, father ; what would you say ?\" \" Nothing ! Meine Got ! but I will get up ! Oh, dear ! what one night this is ! \u2014 I shall never forget this nigbt while I am one merchant in this world ! Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear !\" Mynheer Von Straken got lo his feet now ; and Whilelmina, who had begun to surmise how it was that the door would not open before, now found that a slight touch was sufficient to make it do so. \"Will you go to the rescue of my father V \" Wrhy. look now, Miss Whilel mina \u2014 1 knew a young fellow once who got his eyes both knocked out by trying to rescue somebody ; so, after that, I think I would rather not.\" \" You are a coward and a wretch !\" \" Oh, indeed ! Hard words, Miss Straken.\" \" You shall have harder, if you have any heart at all. I despise you with my whole heart and soul, and I will never be your wife. No, Simpson and Co., as you call yourself, yo'' shall never be my husband. You shall never call me mine. You are a coward and a cold-hearted selfish wretch, with only just intellect enough to know what will be your own interest at the moment. Go, sir, and do not presume to speak to me again : I love another.\" \"Come in,\" said Vou Straken. \" Oh, come in.\" Whilelmina hesitated."], [56, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 46 \"Father,\" she said, \" where has that mysteriou man gone, who came with the storm, and seems to have gone with it again ?\" \" Ah, mine child, that is it. He is one mysterious man. Carl, open that chest, for, as I am a living merchant in the good city of Amsterdam, that was where I saw him get only one short quarter of an hour ago.\" Upon this intimation, Carl, far from accepting so easy a mode of showing his entire devotion to his master, made \" Is not this room, father, that of the shipwrecked sailor ? Is he here ?\" \" Yes, mine child !\" \" Then come out to me, father !\" The servants, by this time hearing Von Straken aud Whilelmina talking, gathered courage, aud thought that the wisest thing they could now do was to make a demonstration of their I loyalty and affection to their master ; so up stairs they ran in a body for that express purpose, and with quite a rush they made their way along the corridor. \" Stop !\" cried Von Straken. The servants all stopped, but Carl made himself the spokeman on the occasion, and in a whining voice, he said \u2014 \u25a0 but one spring from the apartment, and disappeared down the staircase with a speed that, considering his bulk, was really something very extraordinary in- deed. The other servants took example from his fears, for fear is always much more contagious than valour, and they, too, fled with the greatest possible pre cipitation. Von Straken was alone with Whilel mina iu the old decayed room of ill omen in that ancient house. \" Oh, Mynheer Von Straken ! only speak to your faithful Carl, and let him know that you are safe, and he will be a happy man. Only say who have dared to interfere with \" \" Go to the devil !\" said Von Straken. \" You are one great coward, Carl, and get fat upon my substance. Go to the devil !\" For a few moments they both looked at the chest in silence. It was Whilel mina who thus spoke in a low voice. \" You do not mean what you say, father? You only spoke of such a strange thing to frighten Carl ? That was all. You took it from your imagina tion, surely, did you not ?\" \" Imagination, mine child. I never had any imagination. It will never do for a merchant in Amsterdam to have any imagination, mine dear child.\" \"Nay, but father, you did not mean that the shipwrecked sailor had actually got into that chest ?\" \" I did\u2014 I do.\" \"Oh, master! how cruel of you to say such a thing to your faithful Carl, who would die for you.\" \"Would you?\" \" Yes, with pleasure. I only hope I may have the great good pleasure to live to do so, that is all ! It would be one of the most delightful things in all the world to die for Mynheer Von Straken.\" \" Well, mine good Carl, I do think you love your old master \u2014 meine Got I do indeed ; aud I will give you some thing to do, not so difficult as dying for me. Come into the room, mine \"ood Carl.\" Whilelmina took a step nearer to the door. Carl advanced, trembling dreadfully. \"You see that large box, mine friend Carl ?\" \" Is it possible ?\" she said. \" It is true, mine child ; and now, as nobody will open the chest, will you help me to do so ?\" \" Yes, master \u2014 oh, yes, I see it ; and I know that they say it belonged to \u2014to\u2014 to \" \" I will open it, father !

One glauce was suffi cient within it. The chest was empty, with the exception of some old laded apparel ! out of the mass of black clouds, and then the storm, in all its absolute fury, began. Thunder, lightning, and the roaring of the sea, made up such a sedpe of horrors, that any oue who, from some quiet inland spot, had for the first time been exposed to such a world of terrors, must have sunk before it, totally prostrated; and far out at scathe vessels were tossed to and fro, like little black specks in an eteruity of waters ; and the hoarse cry of the sea-bird mingled with the despairing shout of the seaman, as he found that his floating home was too weak to do battle with the fierce ele ments of nature. CHAPTER XIV. GIVES THE EEADE8 A TASTE OP THE SUPEUNATUEAL. We must now, for a time, materially change the scene of our story, and from the sleepy activity of Holland and its inhabitants, we request the reader to accompany us, in imagination, to the Cape of Good Hope. The sea is running mountains high, and a furious storm is breaking upon the rocky shore of that portion of the south western coast of Africa, which appears some days to the mariner before he gets sight ot the Table Mountain at the Cape. For the entire day the storm had been brewing, as it were, and towards sunset the appearance of the sky was so threatening, that every ship in the vicinity of the coast made the most strenuous exertions to get out to sea, for fear the gale should blow them upon that most rugged and inhospitable of shores. But it is to the shore of Africa that we must conduct the reader now, and leave the sea to swallow up its victims at its own good pleasure, and to add more bones to those wbich already lie strewn upon the sandy bed of the ocean. We have mentioned that the shore was wild and rocky, but no description ! could give anything like a just idea of its picturesque appearance at the parti- cular spot to which we conduct the reader. There was a kind of promon- tory, which went out into the sea for the distance of half a mile . 1 1 was composed entirely of rock, and at places the sea had worn caverns right though it, with natural tunnels through which the waves would dash with fury. No doubt it was these tunnels that saved the promontory from being washed entirely away by the storm, for they took off from the weight of the water considerably, and broke its force. Closer inland, by the base of this promontory, was the mouth of a huge cavern in the rock, into which no mortal man had ever entered, for strange un- earthly sounds would at times issue from it, and it was believed to be the retreat of things evil. Strewn upon the little slip of yellow sand, in which gold dust sparkled bril- liantly, which was just in front of the mouth of this cavern, were rare shells cast up from the bosom of the deep, together with a few human bones, borne there by the action of the waves, among which they had perhaps been tossing for a thousand years or more. It was a sad place to look at. and in With sea-room, they might weather the tempest, but if the wind set in for the shore, and they were anywhere near to it, their total destruction was a thing to be assured of, without the shadow of a doubt or a hope. There was a long streak of blood-red colour in the western horizon as the sun declined below the surging sea, and the moment it was gone, the wind howled and shrieked as though it were a living thing, and were wailing for the havoc which in the spirit of its vocation it was compelled to do. As far as the eye could see over the wild waste of waters, there was nothing to see but one vast sheet of white foam, so that the sea looke\"3*like a tempest of snow. A bank of black clouds rose up from the south-west, and the earth, air, and sea were all as dark as absolute blackness could make them. It was just about midnight that one vivid flash of blood-red lightning shot ] storms it was a fearful one. The mouth"], [58, "VANDERDECKEN. 48 A wild shrieking laugh came over the waste of waters. \" Spare me\u2014 oh, spare me !\" added Vanderdecken. \" The demons of a lower world exult in the decree that has gone forth against a mortal soul. Oh, spare me, and let me die ! I only ask to die. As all I loved and all who loved me have done, I, too, wish to do, and that is, to bid the great world good night, anc sleep the sleep of death. I have outlived all human hopes \u2014 all human feelings. There is not one in the wide world with whom I dare claim kindred. The faces of all men are turned against me. Their hands are all raised against me. I am a wretch \u2014 a very wretch ! Oh, spare me ! Is not my fault expiated yet ? Tbe fault of a moment should be washed cut by the tears of ages. Mercy \u2014 mercy \u2014 mercy !\" Again the hideous laugh came upon the night air, and Vanderdecken sunk upon his knees upon the sand, and hiding his face in his hands, he thus re mained so still, that any one might have supposed that his prayer for death had been heard, and that, after all, it was but the lifeless corpse of the Flying Dutchman who was there at that awful hour by the margin of the w'ld sea. of the cavern looked as though it were the entrance of the innermost caverns of the earth. Who, with a mortal life in him, would dteam of entering into those gloomy recesses of nature ? One o'clock came, and the raging storm was at its height, when a small boat touched the slip of yellow sand at the foot of the rocks. There was but one person in that boat. How so small aud trivial a vessel had lived in such a sea, was one of the mys teries of that fearful night ; but it had lived, and there it was, to all appearance, quite uninjured by the storm that was even then sufficient to have dashed it to atoms in a moment. The solitary man who was iu that boat stepped to the shore, and then waving his arms over the boat, it whirled round, and immediately dis appeared beneath the boiling surge, that roared and dashed over the boat, and seemed delighted to drown it. The man stood for a few moments there with his arms folded, looking sea ward, and the foam of the ocean rushed over his feec, and at times dashed at him with such a fury, that it quite covered him up with the hissing spray. Then there came one gleam of forked lightning across the night sky, and it for a moment lit up the strange costume of the solitary man. That man was Vanderdecken ! Alas ! it was not so. Fate had not yet done with him. He had yet lo live. And now, as he knelt by the sea-shore, a strange voice came from the cavern that was so immediately behind him. It sang, or rather chanted, the following words : \u2014 \" Lost one ! \u00abh, lost one ! seek the dim pool t The night it is waning away. Lost one ! oh, lost one ! seek the dim pool ! Ere the dawn of the fast-coming daj. The rock it is cold, and the salt spray is there ; A place all so fit there for thee. Come, then, thou lost ono ! eh, come to the Yes, this was the same Vanderdecken who, at that house at Amsterdam, only some ten minutes or so before the little boat struck upon the golden sands of South Africa, had got into the large chest in the old chamber of the mer chant's house, and from there disap peared so mysteriously. Truly, there is more in heaven and on earth, than is dreamt of in our philo sophy. After the frightfully bewildering flash of lightning, which for so brief a period had lit up the strange costume of Van derdecken, the darkness seemed to be doubly and trebly intense, in comparison to what it wasbelore; and then the poor proscribed wretch spoke. \"Oh, Heaven !\" he cried. \" Just in thy decrees, even when thou seemest most merciless \u2014 just yet, and merciful ever \u2014 how long \u2014 oh, how long shall I yet pool, And seek me beneath the wild sea 1\" The wretched man now rose, and tot tered along the beach. \"It is the night,\" he said; \"it is the hour ! I am called ! and once again I may implore that mercy that I shall not know !

You know that I come.\" THE WONDERS OF THE DEEP REVEALED TO VANDLRDECKES. Every time that he paused ever so little, the voice called out to him again, and it was evident that it came from tbe cavern, towards which he still bent his steps, although he made such slow pro gressjn that direction. But still he did each moment near the mouth of the cavern, and as he did so, the frightful storm that was off the coast increased in violence to that de gree that the air was full of awful noises, and the sea appeared to be intent upon No. 7."], [60, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 50 two hundred feet in diameter, and was of a circular from, the roof being at the least three hundred feet fiom the floor which was strewn with coral, and fine shells, and many a glittering gem from the deep. Vanderdecken stood there, with his hands clasped before him, and in an attitude of supplication mingled with alarm. \" I am here\u2014 I am here,\" he said. \" The pool !\" said the same voice, that had before pronounced his name. \" The pool.\" \" Is there no way of seeking your awful presence but by the pool ?\" \" No way,\" said the voice. \" The time has come, Vanderdecken. I want you !\" taking entire possession of the land, it rushed on to it with so much fury. Vanderdecken fairly entered the cavern. At that moment there was such a yelling shout at the entrance of it as if a thousand devils had gone with him invisibly so far, and dared not proceed any further for fear of some higher power that they dreaded. How intensely, horribly dark the cavern was. \" Vanderdecken !\" cried the voice again. \" I am here,\" he said, in frantic tones, \" I come to seek the pool. I am here \u2014I am here. Do not call me.\" \" Vanderdecken !\" \" Oh, God ! I come\u2014 I come. Why do you permit this evil spirit to vex mj soul in such a fashion. Peace \u2014 peace ! I am looking for the pool.\" All was still now, and Vanderdecken next proceeded in the cavern until be felt the rock before him impeding his progress, but he knew that there was a way through it, and stooping to the ground, he felt for a narrow crevice, through which he began to creep. This opening in the rock was so small, that it was with the greatest difficulty Vanderdecken could make his way through it, but by perseverance he did so, and in the space of five minutes he emerged in a vast interior cavern that had in it a dim and mysterious green light. The roar and racket of the storm could now only be heard in a dim and confused murmur from afar off, and in the huge cavern where Vanderdecken now was a comparative stillness reigned. Tall columns of jasper and of stelactites, which had been the growth of ages, form the roof, and the walls glittered with masses cf rinca that, by being slightly pointed upon the surface, transmitted in all directions the most brilliant hues, and made the place look inexpressibly beautiful. The unhappy man tottered to the brink of the pool, but when there, he made another attempt to bespeak the clemency of the mysterious being who had addressed him. \" Well I know,\" he said, in a low voice, \" Well I know that you are the avenger \u2014 well, I know that to you, by a higher power, has been deputed my fate and my sad \u2014 sad penalty for my offence. I know that ; and I appeal to you, to have some mercy upon me. You can have mercy if you will. All who are deputed to do acts of vengeance can do them gently and feelingly. To you, dead b&ing, then, I appeal. \" Forbear >\" said the voice. \" Yon must appeal to my master!\" \"Your master!\" \u25a0 Yes\u2014 a mightier, far than I, or any of my race. It is to him that you must call for mercy, not to me/' \" I have\u2014 I have appealed to that higher power, but my prayers are un heard. How long must 1 suffer yet ?\" \" Vanderdecken !\" How that strange, invisible voice called him on ! \" I come \u2014 I come,\" he said, with frantic eagerness. \" I know that from the depths in which you dwell you are now gathering anger against me ; but, oh, forbear it, I pray you to forbear it ; for well you know that I am a man of many sorrows.\" As he uttered these words, a faint sound of music pervaded the air. The tune was the same which he had sung with such exquisite and soul-entrancing In the centre of this large cavern there was a glistening pool of water, but so still was it, that it looked more like a huge mirror, laid down there for the purpose of reflecting the various beauties of the cavern in its clear sur face. The pool was about thirty feet across, aud the cavern itself measured more than"], [61, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 51 pathos at the merchant's house in Amsterdam, and which, for a time, en thralled the youthful spirit of Whilel mina. Anything more exquisitely beau tiful in music could not have been con ceived. say to me now ? What hope will you give, to me that may lend me a little more peace of mind ? Oh, speak to me, and speak in mercy.\" \" Vanderdecken, what have you done to receive the curse ?\" said a voice, but although that voice sounded as though it were close to him, there was no form to be seen through the purity of the transparent water. He shook terribly. \" I have erred much,\" he said. *' Oh God, I have erred much !\" With one bound, Vanderdecken plung ed into the pool. There was a shriek, and the water closed over his head in many whirling circles. CHAPTER XV \"Hush. Call not upon your master to witness your acts. They are known. It is a terrible instinct of your fate that speaks to you. Take not the great name of the Lord of Heaven, of earth, and of all the countless host of worlds that are in endless space, in vain.\" \" I will not\u2014 I will not. Oh, pardon me!\" CONVEYS IHE HEADER TO A GREAT DEPTH. What an awful thing was that plunge into the pool ! It hardly seemed possi ble then even Vanderdecken could have mustered courage enough to meditate it ; but so it was. That one mad plunge carried him head foremost into it, and then he disappeared. We must now conduct the reader to a strange abode. It is far \u2014 far beneath the surface of the sea. A huge cavern is decked with sea weed, and coral, and rare gems, that borrow light from the upper air coming right through many fathoms of water. The sea is quiet as glass, at that great depth, and not a ripple disturbs the serenity of the wa ter, which forms like air the atmos phere, so to speak, of that place. Vanderdecken is there ! \" It is past. Say on.\" \"I do not believe but that you are a beneficent spirit. You have at times spoken with kind accents to me. You have not always said harsh things to the poor shrinking soul that is now be fore you. Oh, you, and you only, share with me the knowledge of what I suffer.\" \"Suffer?\" \" Yes ; do you not know. But why do I ask ? You must, and do know that, although my spirit is forbidden to leave its mortal home, that I even now suffer all the pangs of a drowning man, and yet drown not. Is it not so ?\" \" It is so.\" The man of many sorrows and of one great sin, stands in the centre of the cavern which he has reached through that mysterious pool into which he had plunged. The water cannot drown him, and he has the same pale face, and sad looking eyes, in that place as in any other. Air is not essential to his strange and frightful existence. The curse of immortality is upon him, and water will not drown him. Steel will not let out the ruddy stream of life from his veins. The bullet, which, in its frightful pro gress, carries death to all, will not touch him. The curse of immortality in a mortal form is upon him. Vanderdecken spoke. \" I am here,\" he said, in a strange wailing voice. \"I am here. I know that it is my destiny to come here and 1 have long erred to struggle against it. 1 am here. What would you \" Ah ! then even you can pity me, as I writhe in that mortal embrace ! Even you cannot look upon me with your invisible eyes without some pang of commiseration ! Say that you pity me 1\" \" 1 do \u2014 I do ! Heaven pities you ! But the fiat has gone forth, and you are abandoned to us. We are the ministers of retribution to you and to such as you ! And now, Vanderdecken, I ask of you what have you done since last I called upon you to come hither ?\" \" I have striven to do much.\" \"But done little.\" \" So little\u2014 oh, so little !\" \" 'Tis well\u2014 'tis well !

At times, when the wild sea has been lashing the coast with fury, and when the wind has been maddened and sufficient to lift up huge ships from the roarmg waters, I have in likeness, so far as in me lay, of some shipwrecked mariner, climbed to the deck of some vessel \u2014 perhaps dismasted by the storm \u2014 and craved for shelter, but they knew me, and would not hear me. At other times, with a well-con cocted story of having been long at sea, after falling overboard, I have besought them to let me go with them to any port ; but some one has been sure to raise the cry of ' Vanderdecken !' and they would not have pity upon me.\" \" They would not,\" said the voice. \" If they had taken pity upon you, where would have been the curse?\" The frantic manner in which Vander decken uttered these words it would be impossible to describe. He seemed choking with emotion, and battling for life, with the water around him. \" Peace, wretched mortal !\" said the voice. \" It is not 1 who bid you live, but a higher power than you or I even may look upon, and not be dazzled by the refulgence of its glory !\" \"I know it\u2014 I feel it!\" \" You speak of the conditions upon which yon might have escaped the curse that clings to you. I remember them well. Time obliterates nothing with us. They are two.\" \" They are \u2014 they are.\" \"Firstly,\" continued the voice, \"it is not permitted you to touch the land, unless some Christian vessel gave you a passage to the shore ; and it is well known how many you have, with frantic eagerness, besought to give you such a passage in vain. It is known how you have tried to tempt the captain and the crew of many a ship, with gold picked up in the deep bed of the south sea, and with jewels, gathered from the bones of dead men, and from the cargoes of sunken vessels.\" \" At times,\" continued Vander decken, \" I have had kind words spoken to me even by those who even then sus pected who I was ; but still they would not have me in the ship, and it was but an accident that gave me a boat, in which to reach Amsterdam. I did reach it.\" \" It is known to me that you did j and, 0 Vanderdecken, there was ano ther condition upon which you might possibly have obtained pardon from the curse that hangs over you, and redemp tion for the future.\" \" Oh, yes\u2014 yes !\" \"All that is known, but none would take you.\" \" None \u2014 none !\" \"Compelled to look as you look \u2014 compelled to carry with you, too, many evidences of what you are, you were always hurled from the decks of ships into the sea again, or on board your own Phantom Ship, which hovers ever near the Cape.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes. It is too\u2014 too true '.\" \" You have tried many a cunning de vice to get yourself a passage to the shore, and you have failed ; until lately when they gave you a boat \u2014 a boat \" Yes, there was.\" \" That condition was that if you could by any means induce a young and vir tuous girl to be your wife, you would, for her sake, be absolved from the curse ; but you were neither to force her nor to practise upon her fears. If, in any way, through her affection, the end could be attained, it would suffice.\" \" I am not unmindful of that portion of a hope that was held out to me,\" re plied Vanderdecken ; \" but it was a de spairing one, for who, with youth and"], [63, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 53 love about them, would look upon me except with loathing ?\" *' And yet the girl, Whilelmina, was by her father betrothed to you.\" \" Ay. By her father.\" \" You gave him jewels of rare value, and you bought of him his consent ; but when you went to claim the hand that you would fain make your own, you found terror upon the part of the father, and aversion upon the part of the daughter.\" \"I did\u2014 I did!\" \" You had the piece of magic coral, though, by the aid of which you could incline any heart towards you.

You may not change in look or in feature, but you may change in dress and general appearance. You will always be Vanderdecken, but you do not belong to the past age, and, therefore, the change will be great, if you adopt a modern costume, and that you may do.\" \" Well,\" said Vanderdecken, faintly, \"that is something.\" \" It is much. Our conference is now ended.\" At these words, a strange, rushing noise ensued, and the previously calm and placid water began to surge up, and to be violently agitated. Huge rocks toppled down and dashed to fragments, disclosing in their innermost recesses rare and exquisite gems. The coral that hung trailing by the huge stones at the bottom of the sea, seemed to be instinct with life, and some huge monsters of the deep sailed witV temerity straight past Vanderdecken. \"That would be fatal.\" \" The spirit is gone,\" he said. The wretched man uttered now two \" Not so, Vanderdecken. It is much to get women to listen, and then the tongue of passion can do everything. The use of the magic coral was to incline the ear to you. The heart could only be won by your own persuasions and gentleness of conduct.\" \" But there was yet another condi tion.\" \" There was, Vanderdecken ; and that was, that one hour before the marriage you should declare to the bride who and what you really were.\" \"Alas!\u2014 alas!\" or three gasping sobs, as though he were really dying; but such was not the fact. His life was a damned one, and there was, as yet, no hope for him. \"To earth \u2014 to earth, again 1\" he said. \" Yes, once more I must try what the world will do for me ; but ere I go, I will visit the remains of my poor ship that lies embedded in the sands near to this spot. Oh, God ! would that I might be permitted there to lie !\" He walked now with a slow and solemn step along the bottom of the sea. \"But you were not to tell her that by wedding you she released you from a corse ; for you were not to owe to her pity, what you could not owe to her affections.\" As he so walked, Vanderdecken trod upon dead men's bones \u2014 upon old an chors, eaten in with rust, from the action of the waves, during hundreds of years\u2014 upon chests of wearing apparel, and upon heaps of gold and silver, that had show^ ered out from the disjointed ribs of ves sels that had sunk amid the surging waters \u2014 upon cannons, whose terrible mouths .were for ever still\u2014 and over fragments of wreck, be made his way, and scarcely cast a glance upon the many objects around him that for the first time \"I know it\u2014 1 know.it, and all is lost !\" \"Not so.

Growing out of the sides of the vaHey there were strange marine trees and bushes, aad tall plants. Some of these were from thirty to forty feet in height, and this singular foliage was covered with the larv\u00e6 of marine animals, while singular-looking creatures sat clinging to the branches, and glancing at the Flying Dutchman with vague eyes. Vanderdecken heeded them not, but took his course slowly and solemnly down the side of the water into the old sea valley. would have had for any one a most terrible and fearful interest, indeed. Oh, it was a melancholy walk that of Vanderdecken's along the botton of the sea ! After proceeding for some distance, he came to the brink of a precipice, far aelow which was a submarine valley, into which had collected, by the action of the waves in toppling them over, a vast amount of the spoils of the ocean. It seemed as if there lay rotting the broken timbers of a fleet. Bat what was most strange of all was the sea monsters, as well as the more common kind of fish, that sailed past Vander decken so closely as at times to touch him with their long wing, like fins. There were some creatures who were not constructed so that they could rise in the water at all, but who passed their whole existence at the bottom of the sea. These were, in some instances, horrible to look at. CHAPTER. XVI. VANDERDECKEN VISITS AMSTERDAM AGAIN. There had been the wreck of a large merchant vessel during the recent storm off the Cape, and the vessel had gone down into this very valley to which Vanderdecken was now bending his supernatural steps. The vessel had dashed once against the side of the declivity, and had then floated right down, and lay at the bottom of the sea in a tolerable state of preser vation, with the exception of her masts, which she had lost in the storm, and the huge rent in her timbers that had let in the sea, and allowed this brave ship to sink. There was one who lay fastened to a ponderous rock by the power of suction that it had. The body of that creature was some forty feet in width, and its eyes were awful lo look at. It had some thirty or forty long ears, about fifty feet in length each, which it had the power of curling up like the tendrils of a vine, and these arms it kept swaying about all round it to catch whatever came in their way. This fish caught Vanderdecken. One of the long arms twisted rapidly around him ; but then, as if his very touch had been death, the sea-monster made a bellowing noise, and the arms un twisted and fell powerless to the bottom of the ocean, and Vanderdecken was free again. Not a soul had been saved from that ship. The dead bodies were all about the spot. Some had got entangled in the branches of the strange trees \u2014 others lay calm and still, half embedded in the sand, quite at the bottom of the valley \u2014 sea monsters were making a hideous re past upon others. It was a sickening sight, take it for all in all, to look upon. With deep sighs, and now and then striking his breast, as though the anguish of his soul were too great for endurance, Vanderdecken passed this new wreck, and took his way between a ridge of rocks along the valley. He kept his eyes fixed now in one direction, and he soon came in sight of the object that he sought. The ship in which he had sailed as master so many years ago, when he had \" It is in vain,\" he said, mournfully, and without betraying the smallest amount ol fright upon the occasion. \"It is in vain ! Even such a death as that would be welcome ; but it may not be. Alas ! alas ! it may not be.\" He reached the edge of the preeipice now, and after gazing down it for a moment or two, he commenced the de scent. It was much the same thing as de scending the steep rocky side of any valley on land, only that the fluid sur rounding Vanderdecken was water instead of air, and that he was surrounded by"], [65, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 55 made his impious oath at the Cape, lay there half hidden in the sands. carefully avoided the now seemingly lifeless bodies of Vanderdecken's crew. The vessel that in raging storms appeared upon the surface of the water at times, and was called the \" Flying Dutchman,\" was but the phantom of a ship, manned by a phantom crew. \" And this is my work,\" he said, as he clasped his hands together and looked at the still forms around him. \" This is my work. It is true that all who are here joined me in my oath, and sanctioned it with ribald laughter and many blasphemies ; but it is my work, for I it was who ought to have set the example of a better feeling, and so I suffer the most. They only are deprived of the glory of forgiveness in Heaven, and they sleep, while I live and am awake to the desolation of my fate !\" He sat down upon one of the old rusty guns of the ship, and covered his face with his hands ; but he did not weep. Tears were dried to that blighted heart ! A wailing sound came upon the ears of Vanderdecken as he neared thewreek of his old ship. Staggering along as though each moment he would fall, and yet upheld by the waters around him, Vanderdecken at length reached the ship and clambered up upon her deck. No sooner had he obtained a foothold, than from the hatches \u2014 the bulwarks\u2014 the nettings, and the boats, there came swarming around him a hideous throng of spectres \u2014 the spectres of his crew \u2014 the suffering spirits of all those who had joined him in his blaspheming off the Cape. They looked at him with frightfully glossy eyes, and then with one piercing shriek, they cried\u2014 \" Save us, Vanderdecken ! Oh, save us!\" Who shall say what sad and mournful thoughts crossed the brain of that most miserable of created beings, during the time that he thus sat ? What a sad and dismal thing it was for him to think of, wife, home, children, kindred friends, all swallowed up in the tomb so long ago ; while he, with the curse of that strange immortality clinging to him, was unable to die ! How he shook now ! \" Save us Vanderdecken ! Ob, save us!\" He waved his hand for silence, and then he spoke. \"Benighted souls, I will save you. It is my duty \u2014 my toil. Oh, God, yes, I will save them all. Away \u2014 away ! The time has not yet come. You suffer, but I suffer more than all your sufferings. Away \u2014 away !* \" When will it end ? Oh, when will it end?\" There was no answer; The wild sea only seemed to dash more fiercely past the wreck of his vessel. For the space of halt an hour Vander decken sat there in deep thought, and then he rose. He could not look paler than before, and he did not ; but, if it were possible, he certainly did look somewhat sadder than he had looked ; and so he left the vessel, after casting one more glance around its wretched decks. Vanderdecken now hurried on till he came to the edge of the valley. There was a cavern, into which the water rushed, boiling like a cauldron. He cast himself forward into the stream, and was in an instant sucked in by the force of the sea, and disappeared from the valley. * * * * \" Save us, 0 Vanderdecken !\" cried the mournful crew again. It was repeated more than twice or thrice, but each time it grew weaker and weaker, until it ceased ; and as though a deep sleep had come over them all, thelphantom crew drooped into their several places of repose, from which it would appear that the coming of Vanderdecken had aroused them, and in a few minutes all was still on board the wreck of Vanderdecken's old vessel. The sea washed now lazily over the deck. It came in at the ports on one side and surged out at those upon the other, and slimy-looking fishes occa sionally sailed down the hatches in search of food, and then came scram bling up again disappointed. It was strange that these creatures of prey all The dawn of a new day is just touch ing the tops of the churches and of the highest houses and the trees in Amster dam.

Upon some of the house-tops, too, the tulips, which there grow in abun dance, and are thought as much of in Holland as the children, were being attended to ; and at the quays were men already hung on the yards of the ship ping- In another half hour Amsterdam might be said to be fairly awake, and the business of the day to have com menced. Mynheer Von Straken had crawled down stairs, and was in a loose morning wrapper, quilted with fine cotton. His pipe was in his mouth, and the breakfast was upon the table. A cheerful fire burnt \"and crackled in the grate, and opposite to Mynheer Von Straken sat Tom Simpson and Co. Even this going further did not seem to be sufficient to rouse Von Stracken from his apathy, and Tom Simpson and Co. felt that he must go a little further still ; and so, after a pause, he said \u2014 \" I tell you what it is, Mynheer Von Straken, but I can't help thinking that, in a manner of speaking, you know, things ai\u00bb't quite satisfactory in this establishment ; I don't mean to say but vou honour your bills, and keep good books, and all that sort of thing ; but I allude to Whilelmina.\" \"Don't.\" \" What ? Don't, do you say V \" Yah !\" \"Oh, that's all very well, Mynheer Von Straken, but you know there was that fellow \u2014 what's his name?

It's a very astonishing thing, for he isn't well off at all ; but it's a fact, for all that.\" \"Is it?\" Whilelmina had not yet come down, although she had been twice sent for by the merchant. There was a very ominous silence be tween Tom Simpson and Co. and Von Straken : a very ominous silence, indeed. It did not exactly seem as if they quite understood each other so well as they had done. Tom Simpson and Co. looked very fidgetty under the steady gaze of the old merchant ; and, to tell the truth, Von Straken hiisself was so thoroughly bewildered by all that had taken place during the preceding night, that he did not know what to say. \" Yes, in my opinion it is. Now, father and I can't bear anybody that isn't well off, always except they are useful to us in the way of business, yon know, and then we are civil to them while that lasts, but no longer, you understand. That's the way to do business, I rather think.\" \"Very good, Mynheer Simpson and Co.\" Absolute silence, however, was a thing that did not at all suit Tom Simp son and Co. His little mind could not avail itself of any such scene of repose except when he was asleep ; so after a time he broke the silence with an Englishman's never failing subject, the weather. \" Well, I can assnre you, that father would ntjmore be at home to such a fellow as Wurtem Carlis, then he'd think of flying, or lending him anything, and that's putting it in a strong way, if anything is.\" \"Mynheer Von Simpson and Co., what do you want ?\" \" What do I want ?\" \"Likely to be a flue day, Mynheer \u2014 eh?\" \" Meine Got, I don't know.\" \" Oh, no, to be sure.

This reasoning of Simpson and Co. was so very business like, that he could not help admitting in his heart that it was strictly true ; therefore, he found it rather difficul t to reply to so reasonable a spc-tc'i); bat after a rather long pause, he said \u2014 \"Listen.\" WUIITEM CARLIS RESCUES JAN-VAN VAN-JAN FROM HIS ASSAILANTS, \u00ab Well, I will.

Upon this, Whilelmina poured out a huge cup full of very hot coffee, indeed, and by design or accident, we really cannot take upon ourselves exactly to say which, she placed it so near to the edge of the table that when it was given the least touch, over it went right into Tom Simpson and Co.'s lap in a boiling stream. person he spoke so disparagingly was not to be got rid of so easy, the tobacco smoke formed itself, as it will often do, into a ring of a light blue colour, and after reposing upon the air for a few moments, went right into the face of Tom Simpson and Co., and set him off swearing at a terrible rate. \"Confound him !\" said Tom Simpson and Co. \"Yah!\" said Von Straken. \"That is nothing. You shalt have her for your wife, and you will belong to the house of Von Straken, and\u2014 but here she comes.\" At this moment, Whilelmina \u25a0\u2014 who really looked very charming in her morning dress, notwithstanding she might nave spared about fifteen petti coats, and then have had quite enough of them for all useful purposes \u2014 made her appearance in the breakfast-room. Her hair was done up in the neatest little plaits in the world, and her rosy cheeks looked as though some of the most delicate and exquisite fruit had been gently placed upon them ; but such was not the case. It was nature who had dyed the pure cheeks of Whil elmina with her best rose tint. CHAPTER XVIII. THE DIFEICULTIES OP VON STRAKEN EATHER INCREASE. \"Good morning, father,\" she said, and then she advanced to Von Straken, and kissed his cheek. This most unexpected assault so alarmed Tom Simpson and Co., that he sat for a moment or two paralysed and unable to move, while the hot liquid made itself freely acquainted with his legs. Then he jumped up with a roar like that of a hundred bulls, and began dancing about the room in a manner that so astounded Von Straken, that he actually dropped his pipe. When a Dutchman drops his pipe he has reached the acme of astonishment, and can get no further in that way. \" Murder\u2014 murder !\" roared Tom Simpson. \" Meine child, good morrow,\" said the old man, and there was a visible tremor about him as he spoke. \" Good morning Miss Von Straken,\" said Simpson and Co. \"Good morning,\" said Whilelmina, as with all the petticoats she brushed past Tom Simpson and Co., and did not even condescend to look at him, while the \" good morning \" was pronounced in such a tone that it would have done quite as well for \" bad morning.\" Whilelmina set about getting her father's breakfast, according to the custom in Holland, even in the wealthiest families of the merchants; but she would not look upon Tom Simpson and Co. The breakfast consisted of a quantity of dried fish \u2014 firmly baked roils \u2014 and a drink compounded of Java coffee and cocoa, and an abundance of hot cream in it. The merchant, though, always qualified his cup with a pretty good dash of Hollands, for he generally felt rather weak, and was in want of a \" Meine Got !\" said Von Straken. Whilelmina pretended to be looking at a rose that was in a little vase on the chimney-piece, and paid no more atten tion to the antics of Tom Simpson and Co. than as if he had not been there at all. \" Fire !\" cried Tom Simpson, vary ing his cry. \" Fire 1 Ob, lor '.

Oh-oh\u2014 oh !\" He sank into a chair, and began cry-"], [69, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 59 ing like a great schoolboy who has re ceived very unexpectedly a flogging. Now it so happened that Mynheer Von Straken had not happened to ob serve the fall of the coffee into the lap of Tom Simpson and Co., as his regards, at that moment, were fixed upon the celling of the apartment, and the cup fell to the floor without breaking ; therefore, the first intimation that he, Von Slraken, had of the affair, was the extraordinary dance that Tom Simpson and Co. executed, apparently for nothing at all. fairly gone, the merchant shook his head at Whilelmina. \" Meine child,\" he said, \"you should not do such things to the man who is to be your husband.\" \" No more I won't, father.\" \"You won't\u2014 eh? You won't? Oh, but you have, he says.\" \"Yes; but I don't intend that he should ever be my husband. I have quite made up my mind now, father, and if he were one lump of gold, or if he had all the wealth of the world to offer me in exchange for this little hand, I would not give it to him.\" As she spoke, Whilelmina placed the identical little hand right upon the larger one of the merchant. \"Meine Got!\" said Von Straken. \" He is mad,\" said Von Straken. \" Mad !\" shouted Tom Simpson and Co., \"so would you be, if you had suffered what I have. I am done brown, I tell you.\" \" Meine child,\" added Von Straken, \" what is the matter with Tom Simpson and Co. ?\" Whilelmina flung her arms round his neck, and looked him in the face in silence. \" How can I tell, father ? I always thought him a little weak in his head, and now he is getting violent.\" \"But she upset the hot coffee over me,\" roared Tom Simpson and Co. \"Was that all ! Meine friend, laugh at it. Smile at it. Never mind it\u2014 never mind it.\" \" Meine Got 1\" he said again. \" N ow, father, listen to me. This man that you wish me to marry, is a vain, finikin, cold, selfish, dishonest piece of vulgarity.\" \" Oh !\" \" There is not one good quality about him. He is a coward, too, as his con duct last night sufficiently testified. It is quite impossible that any wife could respect such a husband, and, therefore, 1 won't have him. I know, dear father, that I owe you obedience \u2014 the obe dience of a child ; but I know, likewise, that you would be the last person in all the world to exact that obedience at the price of my happiness for ever in this world ; and so you will not ask me to marry Tom Simpson and Co., who you must despise as much as I do.\" This was such an extraordinay speech for Whilelmina to utter, that the old merchant could only, with his mouth and eyes wider open than usual, look at her with amazement. \" Laugll at it! I should like to catch anybody laughing with a cup of red hot coffee in their laps ! Smile, indeed ! Oh \u2014oh, smile did you say ?\" \" Yah, Mynheer.\" \" And I do believe she did it on pur- pose.\" \" Meine good friend, if she did, it was only one little bit of fun, and one little trick of one girl.\" \"A little trick, do you call it? Fun!' \" Yes, meine friend, you ough to con sider it out of love for you.\" \"Ought I? If that's the way she makes love before marriage, I suppose she will boil me in the coffee after it. I am skinned already. Excuse me, Von Straken, I must go and get on some other clothes, for it aint very pleasant to remain in this state. Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear ! If this is Dutch fun and a mere trick of a young girl, heaven preserve me always in Newgate Street. I feel \u2014 1 don't know what I feel.\" Poor Tom Simpson rose, and, bent double with the pain he was suffering, he hobbled out of the room. When he was Whilelmina trembled a little. She was afraid that the end of all this might possibly be a great explosion of wrath upon the part of her father. About three minutes passed thus, during which, the old merchant could do nothing but look in the face of Whilel mina ; but at last he jerked out, as if he had not quite breath enough to do it, these words : \u2014 \" How like\u2014 how like !\""], [70, "60 VANDERDECKEN; OR, \"i say, when first I knew her. There was no one in all Amsterdam to be compared with her, poor soul.

What do you mean ?\" \" Like vour mother.\" What a\" relief it was to Whilelmina to hear that the strong resemblance the merchant was able to trace between her _and her mother was the cause of his silent regard of her ! She fell weeping upon his shoulders. \"Father\u2014 dear father!\" she said, \"I know that you will forgive me ! I feel assured that you will do so. You are not the kind of father who would doom his child to misery for life, merely for the purpose of making a commercial alli ance, are you now ?\" \" Meine Got !\" \" You do\u2014 you do. But \" \" Oh, do not say another word. Let me think that I have your fullest appro bation, father, without any hesitation whatever.\" \" You have ; but \" \" Alas, that but again !\" \" Yet listen to me, meine child. It is all very well for a young girl to say she don't want to marry \u2014 hem ! That lasts till she sees the man she likes, and no longer.\" \" Father\u2014 father !\" \"No,\" added Whilelmina, choosing for the nonce to translate that rather vague expression into a negative to suit her wishes. \" I know that you would not ; and so, now that we quite under stand each other upon this point, it is quite a happy thing ; and as long as we live, we sha'l not differ about auything.\" \"Ah!\" \" Daughter\u2014 daughter ! I know what I say ; and, besides, the time will come, and it can't be very far off, and it may be very close at hand, when I must go to the family grave of the Von Strakens, and then you will feel lonely and chill in tbe house by yourself.\" \" Oh, father, let me hope that that time will be very distant, indeed.\" \" Heaven direct it may be, Whilel mina, meine child. Yet it is sure to come, and in the order of nature it ought to come. Holland would not hold the Dutch, if the old did not go the way of all flesh, and make way for the young.\" This was a proposition that Whilel mina could not dispute, so she was silent, and only very much wondered to herself that her father, who was usually so tacir turn, should take it into his head to say so mucL. \"It is true,\" added Whilelmina, \"that there are cruel fathers in Amsterdam who prefer accumulating wealth to the happiness of their daughters ; hut Hea ven has been too good to me to give me such a father; and I am truly thankful, accordingly, that I am among the more fortunate damsels of our city.\" \"Ah!\" The eloquence and the assumption of Whilelmina took the old merchant's breath away. Mynheer Von Straken was never, at the best of times, a very rapid thinker ; and, now that Whilelmina was good enough to think for him, and not only to do that, but to translate his very silence into an acquiescence in her wishes, it is no wonder that he felt just a little confounded and bewildered. \" Therefore,\" continued Von Straken, and he made a great circle in the air with his pipe, \" therefore, meine child, I wish, before I go, to see you married and happy.\" Now, to tell the truth, Whilelmina was of the same opinion as the old mer chant, only it is well known all over the world it is quite a practice of young ladies to declare they don't want to get married, when there is any obstacle to their marrying the person of their choice. If the old merchant had only proposed Wurtem Carlis to Whilelmina, she would This was a state of things, however, that could not last, and Von Straken, in a voice of alarm, at length said\u2014 \" Meine child, who will yon marry, if you do not marry Tom Simpson and Co ? You will never get a better offer.\" \" No one, father. I do not intend to marry. I will remain with you, and con duct the affairs of your house for you ; and I am glad to hear that you think me like ray mother.\" \"Meine Got! you and she are as much alike as tw) nutmegs\u2014 that is to"], [71, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 61 have found out pretty quickly not only that she had no objection to marry, but it would be greatly to the satisfaction and the well-doing of all parties that she should do so without further delay. \"Oh, father,\" she said, \"you must not speak to me of leaving you.\" \" Yes, I must.\" \"No \u2014 no, do not do so.

Do not say that, for you know, father, that the same mysterious power that enabled him to leave this place as he did leave it, may enable him to come back again to it.\" At this moment there came a knock upon the ceiling above them, aud both Vou Straken and his daughter started. The knock was repeated three times, and then all was still. \" Along with Tom Simpson and Co.\" The old merchant groaned. It was quite evident to him that Whilelmina would not marry the husband of his choice, and that the two great houses of Tom Simpson of Newgate Street, and Von Straken of Amsterdam, would not Come together, as had been projected. \"Meine child,\" he said, \"it is a golden rule of business to do one thing at a time. You know that ?\" \" What is that 1\" said the merchant, \"Oh, what is that?\" \"Alas, I know not,\" said Whilel mina. \" I do, father.\" \" I know that you know it ; and to prove to you, meine Whilelmina, that I know you know it, I will tell you that you have two things to do. The one is, to get rid of the lover you do not like ; and the other is, to wed the lover that you do like ; but as you know that it is better to do one thing at a time, you must first get rid of Tom Sixipson and Co. before you say anything about Wurtem Carlis.\" \" It is ominous. Frightfully omin ous.\" \" Do not say that. It is, perhaps, after all, only some of the servants moving some large piece of furniture, father.\" \"It may be so. Hush !* Knock \u2014 knock \u2014 knock ! came the same description of sound as before, and it truly had a strange and suggestive character with it. The merchant and his daughter looked at each other with affright. \" I will go,\" said Von Straken, \" and see what it is.\" This was so exactly the truth, that Whilelmina could only hang her head, and make no reply to it. \" Go,\" said Von Straken. \" Go to your chamber at once. I will think \u2014 I will think. I am an unhappy man!\" \" And I, too, father.\" \" No, meine child, you will stay here. If there be danger, it is I who ought to face it, not yon. You are a young and tender plant, but I am old and of little value\u2014 ob, so little value now.\" This was probably about the first time that Von Straken had ever said any thing of a very depreciating character of himself ; but it was wrung from him by the circumstances which surrounded him. Even he, with all his wealth, began to feel the nothingness of human possessions without that peace of mind which is beyond all price, and, without which a crown is but a weight upon the brow. \"Yes,\" ho added, \"I am tnentv \" Oh, no father \u2014 not unhappy while you have me to love you.\" \"Pose!\" \" You can't doubt my affection, father ? That is impossible !\" \"I doubt all the world.\" \" Ob, father, it is the strange and ill-timed visit of that mysterious sailor that has so completely changed your nature, and made you so very unhappy. How is it that he left the house ?\" \" The chest !\" \"But it can't be possible that he got into that great chest, and from thence disappeared V \"No,\" gasped Von Straken, \"it is"], [72, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 62 ing with her all the happiness that mutual love could produce. We have seen, however, that that poverty did not induce Wurtem Carlis to yield to the temptations that Mynheer Vou Straken held out to him. His honest and brave heart rose superior to all the temptations, and he had left the old house as poor as he went into it. Yes, poor Carlis, when he left Van derdecken's old house, had not enough with him to purchase a meal's victuals on the morrow ; but he felt as if he were as rich as Cr\u0153sus in one thing, and that was in the undoubted knowledge that the fair Whilelmina loved him. years older now in spirit than I wa forty eight hours ago, before the storm in the Zuyder Zee, and the visit of that stiange man, who has disappeared from us more strangely than he came. Oh, it is sad to think of what I was, and of what I am now !\" The old merchant rose\u2014 it was not without difficulty, though, for the easy chair in which he was, fitted him capitally by constant use, and it was quite an effort to wrench himself out of its vast embraces ; and making his way towards the door, he said,\u2014 \u2022 \" My dear, I cannot help suspecting that that dreadful man will come again. Yes, he will come again.\" \" I pray not.\" \" Yes, pray, my child. Pray for your poor old father, who, with all his ships that crowd the quays of Amsterdam \u2014 with all his warehouses, full of rarities from every quarter of the globe, is yet one of the most unhappy of men. Pray for me, my child !\" Von Straken was within two or three paces of the door, when it was sud- denly flung open, and Vanderdecken ap- peared upon the threshold, with his arms uplifted, and looking frightfully wan and pale. After the events of the night, it was quite impossible that he could entertain any doubt upon that subject, '* She loves me \u2014 she loves me I'* These were the words which he kept repeating to himself as he ran along the streets in the direction of one of the quays of the city. By the time Carlis reached the quay, he was quite out of breath, and it was some few moments before he had power to look about him, and when he did so, it was with dismay. The spot upon which had ridden the large ship in which he had been about to leave Amsterdam was now quite vacant. \" Where is the good ship San Nicho las ?\" he cried. Oh, where is the San Nicholas ?\" CHAPTER XVIII. WURTEM CARLIS'S PROJECTS AND DESPERATE SCHEME. \"The San Nicholas, Mynheer?\" said one of the loungers on the quay, taking his pipe out of his mouth and puffing a long stream of smoke into the early morning air. \"Did you say the San Nicholas I\" We must now for a very brief space, indeed, leave the merchant, Von Straken, and the amiable and lovely Whilelmina, while we follow Wurtem Carlis from the merchant's house, after his refusal of the offer to commit the murder of the mys terious guest. With all the events that took place in the house, contingent upon that refusal, the reader is already acquainted; and now he will be so good as to suppose himself in the streets of Amsterdam, along with Wurtem Carlis. That this young man loved Whilel mina with a pure and honourable love, and that he was in every respect worthy of all tke attachment she could by any possibility feel for him, there can be no doubt whatever in the world. It was his poverty alone that was the disquali fication that kept him back from enjoy - \" I did\u2014 I did.\" \"There she is, then.\" \" Where\u2014 where ? Oh, tell me where ?\" \"There.\" The speaker pointed with the stem of his pipe westward, and poor Wurtem Carlis turned his eyes in vain to catch a glimpse of the immense vessel, which, if it had been anywhere in sight, could not have escaped the keen vision of the youth. He could see nothing but the waters, and some lazy craft at anchor with all sails furled, and the haze of the morning, as it rested upon the Zuyder Zee. \" I do not see her.**"], [73, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 63 \" No,\" said the man who had spoken to him. \" She went with the tide full two hours ago, and she is now far out in the offing.\" \" Then I am lost. I had a passage in her, and now I am lost, indeed I\" \"Not so, Mynheer. There is the Jong Frauw, a fast sailer. A better boat never stemmed the waters. For a guilder we will go out to sea with you, and come up with the San Nicholas.\" \" Alas !

He rose from the coil of chain-cable, upon which he had seated himself, and in a low voice, he said\u2014 \" Now I am desolate.\" With these words he took his way into the city again. Now, it will be in the recollection of the reader, that the great rich merchant Von Straken had told Wurtem Carlis he might call at his bankers for fifty guilders ; but would the young man take advantage of the gift i No\u2014 no. Not if he had to get his living by the meanest labour that was open to him in all Amsterdam, he would not. That says something for the indepen dent spirit of Wurtem Carlis. \" It was the price of a muider,\" he said, as the recollection came across him ; \"and although Von Straken, no doubt, would be glad now to make it the price of secrecy, yet I will not touch his gold. I swore to be secret without, and I will keep my oath, although I will never swear secrecy again about anything, without knowing beforehand what it means.\" \" Oh, this is sad indeed,\" said Wur tem Carlis. \" I meant to have gone and sought my fortune in other lanas in the San Nicholas, and perhaps I should have been able to come back rich and prosperous ; and then, finding the fair Whilelmina still faithful to me, as no doubt she would have been, I could have demanded her in marriage and been happy.\" He sat down upon a coil of chain cable, and resting his head upon his hands, he gave himself up to painfnl thought. \" Here I am, a wanderer, in Amster dam, without the means of getting a meal's victuals, and my family used to walk about upon this very quay, and be looked upon as little short of princes \u2014for they were in the shadow 01 their own ships that lined yonder basin. What am I now ? A beggar\u2014 a beggar \u2022-no, I am not that : I never begged vet\u2014 I am not that.\" This was a wise determination of Wurtem's, and well worthy of general imitation by all who may by accident be placed in such circumstances as he was when he visited the merchant at his old terrible demon house. For a little time, now, as Wurtem hurried on, he was silent ; and then, as though pursuing a train of thought, he said in a low but firm voice \u2014 With something of the pride of youth about him, Wurtem Carlis looked np and dashed the tears from his eyes. The morning had by no means come yet. The lights still burnt upon the quay, and from the stern galleries of the stately merchantmen that lazily rocked to and fro in the tide, streams of artificial light came into the water, tinting its ripples with a golden glory. The city of Amsterdam still slept, and the stillness was only such as at that very early hour could be a condition of sucn a port. In fact, it was just the short interval before the dawn would \" No. Let my evil fortune be what it may, I am determined that I will never compromise my feelings nor my principles, so that if the day should ever come that lam a rich man, I shall have nothing to recollect of myself in my poverty wbich will then bring the flush of shame to my cheeks.

By the time the young man had come to these conclusions, which were alike honourable to his head and his heart, he had got into along street in Amsterdam,"], [74, "VANDERDECKEN. 64 evidently slipped out of its sheath, and in all likelihood belonged to the man who was in the grasp of the assassins. It was quite impossible that Wurtem Carlis could possess the other qualities that he did, and at the same time be a coward. Bravery and the class of mind that belonged to him, were sure to go together. Without the hesitation of a moment\u2014 for to hesitate would be to lose the opportunity of action \u2014 the young man darted forward, and picked the glittering sword from the ground. \" Cowards ! \u2014 Villains '. \u2014 Assassins !\" he cried, and then he made a dash at the group of men, who were bringing the other towards the canal, into which in another minute they would have thrown him. which led along the banks of a canal, and, if continued, would go out into the \" flats,\" as a portion of the city was called, where were some of the best flower-gardens that surrounded the city. Some of the houses in that street were the oldest in all Amsterdam. They were composed of mud principally, and had huge overhanging roofs, and the windows looked like little eyes, half hidden by such a brow as was sufficient to nearly obliterate them entirely, and certainly to keep them always in the shade. The inhabitants of these houses ap peared to be all asleep, except in one, from a window of which there streamed a light. Wurtem Carlis looked up at that window with some curiosity, but he did not think that it would in any way concern him to do so. In another mo ment or two he would have been past the house, and no doubt then he would hardly have turned back for anything he might have heard ; but while he was still within sight of the door of it, that door was suddenly opened, and a throng of men issued forth. The assault of Wurtem Carlis was so utterly unexpected, and withal so furi ous, that it spread consternation among the five men. Two of them received serious wounds, and a third fell to the ground, run through the body, and still Wurtem plied the sword, until the others fled in dismay. All this was the work of so short a space of time, that the stranger who had been rescued from death by the gallantry of Wurtem Carlis could hardly believe his own senses, but stood in amazement, without being able to stir hand or foot to aid his gallant young deliverer. Wurtem Carlis shrunk back, for well hekDew that, in that part of the city es pecially, there were lawless people who thought nothing of sallying out maddened by drink, and assaulting and murdering every one they met. It was a very con venient thing to throw a dead body, or even a wounded one, into the canal. That was the grand depositary of all such secrets iu Amsterdam. Carlis rested upon the sword. \"\u25a0 The rascals !\" he said. \" They are all gone. Are you hurt, sir ?\" \" Hurt ? Never mind my hurts, but tell me if you are at all injured, my noble friend?\" There were no less than five men, and as they issued out of tbe house, they raised wild shouts, and he could hear them say\u2014 \" Kill him ! \u2014 Cast him into the canal ! \u2014 Kill him, and then there will be an end of it !\u2014 Kill him, be he whom he may ! \u2014 Cut his throat first ! \u2014 Bun him through the body !\" Rather surprised at their cries, Wur tem Carlis advanced a little closer, and then he_ saw that the five men had another in their grasp, whom they were hauling along towards the canal, and who was making all the resistance in his power to save his life. As they passed Wurtem Carlis, a long straight bright sword fell to the ground, and lay glittering there. It had \" Not a scratch.\" \"Thank Heaven for that!\" \" Amen ! Is this your sword ?\" \" It is\u2014 it is.\" \"Why, the hilt is of gold, or else I am but a poor judge of the precious metal. Is it so?\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no !\" said the stranger, with some confusion of manner. \" But never mind that. Only tell me to whom I am indebted for my life.\" \" Let me beg of you in your turn,\" said Carlis, \" never to mind that, but to leave this place at once, or them fellows, finding, after all, that we are not in force here, may come back to us, and finish"], [75, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 65 their night's work by adding me to their list of murders.\" plainly in black.'seized Carlis by the arm and led him to the side of the canal, a little way off from the spot where the men intended to have thrown him in, and then Wurtem saw that there lay a boat \" True\u2014 most true !

It is not an easy matter with very many people to describe them selves in a few words ; and certainly Carlis, in his present situation, was brought completely to a stand-still with the mere attempt. \" Why do you pause ?\" said the stranger. \"Just because I know not what to say, that's all.\" \" How can that be ? Surely, you know what you are, as well as who you are?\" \" Yes, I ought to know.\" \"Pardon me,\" said the stranger, sud denly, in an altered tone. \" It ill becomes me, after receiving such a ser vice at your hands, to ask any questions of you that may embarrass you ; so I will say no more upon that subject, anxious as I am for further acquaintance with did so, for, with frantic shouts, there rushed now from the house more men, and who made their way to the edge ot the canal. \" Pull away,\" said the stranger. The man in the boat did so, and in a few moments the little craft, with its occupants, was completely lost to sight from the ehore in the fog that at that time was upon the canal. \"I am amazed,\" said the stranger, \" that I have escaped with life. They might have killed me before you came up.\" \" If they had been at the brink of tho canal they would have done so,\" said Carlis, \" but those assassins, I have beard, never like to shed blood, if they can help it, near their own doors; and it was to that circumstance you owed your life.\" The stranger shuddered as Wurtem Carlos spoke. you.\" Turning to the boatman, the stranger then gave him an order to land them at a certain spot, and during the few minutes that elapsed before the boat was run into the landing-place, nothing was said by either Wurtem or the stranger. \"You are paid, recollect,\" said the stranger, as he sprang ashore. \" Yes, Mynheer,\" said the boatman. Wurtem followed the stranger as quickly as he could, and then he saw him with an expression of pain upon his face, and he said, \u2014 \" Are you hurt ?'' \" Yes, a little. The knaves gave me a slight wound in the neck, but as I sat in the boat I forgot it. In springing on shore, though, I gave it a wrench, and it is painful. But no matter.

The mist upon the canal was very cold and chill, indeed, and when Wurtem \"Carlis saw the stranger whom he had rescued from death shudder, he thought it was on account of the cold, and he said \u2014 \" Our fogs in Holland are none of the warmest, Mynheer. Are you a native of the place ?\" \" I am, but I did not shudder at the cold, for I am very well wrapped up against it. 1 shuddered at the thought of the death vou had preserved me from.\" \" I pray you not to say any more about that. When I saw you in the hands of those rascals, ana a bright sword cast close at my feet, I felt that it was my duty to fly to your aid ; and I can assure you it would have been to me a much more difficult matter to leave you alone and allow them to murder you, than to assist you as I did.\" \" You are as generous as you are brave. Have you any objection to tell me who you are ?\" \" None in the least. My name is Wurtem Carlis, and I am\" \u2014 here poor Wurtem stopped short, for he found it \" Simply that you will meet me at this spot to-morrow night, at the hour of twelve.\" Wurtem considered a little, and then, with rather an embarrassed air, he said\u2014 \" Heaven only knows if I can do so ; and now that we are alone, I don't mind telling you.\" Poor Wurtem paused again. He got suddenly afraid that if he went on, the stranger would think he wanted some thingof him. \"Why is all this ?\" said the stranger."], [77, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 67 \"You are every moment upon the point of saying something to me that a second thought urges you to keep to yourself.\" \" that is just it.\" \" But why is it so ? Surely you may have confidence and faith in me ? And yet, what am I saying ? You do not know me any more than 1 know you, or rather, I should say, that I know you much better than you know me.\" \"Indeed, Mynheer?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes ! I know that you are hu mane and noble in your disposition ; and you do not know so much of me, al though I hope that if a similar occasion had arisen, and you had been assaulted, and I in your position, I should have acted as you acted.\" \" I am sure you would.\" \" How so ? How can you be sure I would ?\" \"Mynheer, of course I can see easily enough what this must lead to. It is to an offer of assistance ; but I so shrink from taking anything that will look like payment for the service I have been so happy as to render you, that \u2014 that \u2014 \" \" That, in fact,\" said the stranger, \"you will be so foolish as to leave me as you are, when 1 would be your friend, and have the power to be so? Come \u2014 come, Wurtem Carlis \u2014 you see I recollect your narae ? \u2014 this must not be. I have the means to aid you, and 1 wilt do so. Various circumstances pre vent me asking you now to come to my house ; but, in the meantime, I can supply your urgent necessities. Do you know the banking house of Von Rotter and Co.?\" \"I do.\" \" Very well, wait a minute.\" The stranger took from his pocket a pocket-book and pencil-case, and tear ing a leaf from the former, he wrote something upon it, and folding it up, he handed it to Wurtem Carlis, saying\u2014 \"Take that to Von Rotter and Co., and they will give you cash for it. Do not be afraid to spend it, and meet me as I request at this place to-night, at twelve.\" \" There is a frank nobleness about your manner that assures me of so much. I go much by the tones' of people's voices \u2014 the expression of their face \u2014 and 1 can just see yours now in the morning light \u2014 and their attitudes as they speak; and so from looking at you and trusting to you, I am sure you would have done by me as 1 have done by you.\" \" I thank you for your favourable judgment.\" \" And now I will tell you that I will meet you here, if I can ; but I am so utterly destitute in Amsterdam, through no fault or errors of my own, that I know not where to get a meal, and, therefore, I may engage myself to something that may take me far away from the city long before twelve at night comes again.\" \" Can this be possible ?\" \" Alas ! Mynheer, it is to me a sad fact ; but I almost regret now that I told you of it.\" \" But have you no friend ? Are you so proud as well as poor that you would Dot allow a friend to aid you under such circumstances ?\" \" I will, Mynheer \u2014 I will. And now I plainly see, that if a man will not desert himself, that Heaven will never desert him.\" \" Farewell '.\" The stranger was gone before Wur tem Carlis could say another word to detain him ; and there stood the young man, who had been so utterly destitute only a short time before, with, at all events, although he did not know the amount, sufficient, no doubt, in his hands to keep him for the day that was fast breaking over the good city of Amster dam. \" Well,\" said Wurtem, \" this is a strange adventure, after all ; but I will see wliat the man, whom I so fortunately saved, has nut down upon the paper. Let me see. * Hem ! Oh !\" \" No \u2014 no ! But I have no friend ?\" \" Ah, Mynheer, will you not let me call myself one ? Surely the man whose life you saved might be your friend ?\" Wurtem Carlis saw that he was caught, as it were, in a friendly snare, and he knew not what to say ; but after a slight pause he managed to speak in a deprecating tone of voice, saying\u2014 The words upon the paper were as follows \u2014 \"Pay my friend, Wurtem Carlis, the bearer of this, the sum of one hundred guilders, and oblige \" Jan-Van Van- Jan.\" \" To Von Rotter and Co.\""], [78, "68 VANDERDECKEN; OR, The reader will be good enough to suppose that the above line of stars signifies that Wurtem Carlis has been asleep for about three hours and three quarters. \" Hilloa!\" said a voice, \"get up, and be off ! Meine Got ! we don't want any drunken rascals here upon this door-step. Get up and be off, or a prison shall be your portion !\" This application to Wurtem was suc ceeded by a hearty kick from some one, which at once aroused all the energies of the young man, and raising his hand, he caught the foot of his assailant, and giving it a pull, upset that person, and sent him rolling into the kennel. \" Murder ! help ! help !\" shouted the individual who had thus so very justly expiated his incivility and his rudeness. \" Murder ! Oh ! I am nearly killed !\" Upon this, several people rushed out of the house, and laid hold of Wurtem Carlis, who had risen, and was looking in rather a confused manner about him ; and the individual who had rolled into the kennel was lifted up, and brought, limping, up the steps. \" I hope,\" said Wurtem, \" that this will be a lesson to you.\" \" A lesson to me !\" cried the indi vidual. \" Merciful Providence ! all I did, was to give a slight kick to a vagarant that was sleeping on the door-step, and for that I am to be thrown into the road-way at the risk of my life, and bruised all over from top to toe ! But I will have the law of this rascal, who I am sure is poor.\" Poverty is almost as great a crime in Holland as it is in England; so when those who had hold of Wurtem had this opinion of him, they set him down immediately as the worst character they had ever met with. \" The idea,\" said one, \" of a poor person daring to sleep on our door step ! Oh, how 1 hate poor people !\" \" And so do I,\" said another ; \" they have no right to sleep at all.\" \" Nor to live,\" said a third. \" No,\" cried another, '* they ought al' to be thrown into the Zuyder Zee as rubbish; and the notion of one of them sleeping upon the door-step of the illustrious house of Von Hotter and Co. is enough to make one'a hair to stand on end.\" Wurtem very nearly let the paper fall, he was so astounded at the amount that was expressed upon it. \" One hundred guilders !\" he cried. \" Why, it is a sum that would last me a year, and he told me to spend it with out fear. One hundred guilders ! Surely I am deceived.\" He held the little slip of paper more in the light, and there, sure enough, were the words. But what a strange signa ture it was. With a pang of disappoint ment, and a slight accession of rage, the idea did just for a moment cross the mind of Wurtem that he was made the victim of a cruel hoax ; and for a very little provocation, indeed, he would have thrown the little note into the canal. The more prudent spirit, however, of Wurtem prevailed, and he did not do anything so foolish. \"Never mind,\" he said; \"lam so used to disappointments and to rebuffs now, that I will not felicitate myself upon the idea of this order being honoured at the banking-house ; but I will go with it for all that, and if it should be all right, why, then I will remain in Amsterdam, and if anybody only does so much as to look at Whilelmina, they shall have to answer to me for it, that's all. Oh, if I could only get a breakfast now, some how, that would be everything.\" Poor Wurtem felt the pangs of hunger hard upon him, but stiil he could see no mode of assuaging them. It wanted a good four hours before the banking-house of Von Rotter and Co. would open, and what to do during that time he did not know for the life of him. After wander ing about for a time, he saw a very old fashioned house, the steps of which were of wood, and the door-way very deep and shaded. \" If I could only get to sleep,\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"and wake up when the sun is shining, if it intends to shine to-morrow, all would be well, and I should forget that I am hungry. The people of this house will not get up for some hours yet, and it is so dark in this doorway, that no chance passenger will see me. I will lie down here.\" With this determination, Wurtem crept inside the doorway, and huddling hiniself up in one corner, he soon fell fast asleep, \u2022 _\u2022-\u25a0#\u2022"], [79, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 69 \"What!\" cried Wurtem, \"is this Von Rotter's the banker ?\" \"Oh, you wretch, you know that well enongh. You know that onlj yesterday we removed from our old establishment in the Boomfees, because the house was falling down, to this, and, of course, your design was to rob the place, but you could not force the door.\" \" This is strange,\" said Wurtem, as he began to feel in his pocket for the stranger's order for the hundred guilders, and luckily fouud it. \"This is very strange, indeed.\" Those who were about him began to think him mad, and they were the more confirmed in that opinion, when he said\u2014 \"I must see Mynheer Von Rotter himself immediately.\" \" And, pray, what do you want with Mynheer Von Rotter ?\" \"That is my business.\" Upon this, they all laughed loudly, but Wurtem shook off the hold they had of him, and taking a step towards the now open door of the banking-house, be said \u2014 \" If Von Rotter does not see me, 1 will close his doors before noon.\" There was something in the manner of the young man which made those who had been disposed to treat bim so scur vily feel inclined, in spite of them selves, to be a little more respectful, so they kept their hands off him, and only remained close to him, for fear he should make some desperate attempt of some kind or another either to escape or to commit a robbery. In that way, then, they all made their way into the banking-house, whioh Wur tem had not previously the least idea was that same house with the old deep door; way iu which he had lain down to rest. There was now a solemn pause, as one of the clerks went in a very slow and methodical manner to tell Von Rotter that he was wanted. Now, the great Von Rotter was just four feet six inches in height, and about six feet four inches in width, so that, for the taste of the Hollanders, he was considered the handsomest figure in all Amsterdam. There was not a maiden in all the city who did not sigh to be Mrs. Von Rotter ; and when he went out for a walk to the corner of the street and back again, he was always followed by an admiring throng. This was the great banker of Amster dam, who now appeared with his cheeks inflated by anger at being summoned to see and speak to somebody that there was all the reason in the world to be lieve was dreadfully poor, if not some thing worse\u2014 No\u2014 no : there could be nothing worse than being poor. We humbly beg the pardon of Mynheer Vou Rotter by supposing he could for a mo ment entertain any such ideas. Rage choked the utterance of the great banker, as he looked up to Wurtem Carlis, who looked down to him with great disdain. \" Well ?\" at last gasped out Von Rotter. \" Are you Von Rotter, the banker ?\" said Wurtem, although he knew\u2014 as who in Amsterdam did not? \u2014 the figure before him perfectly well. Upon being thus unceremoniously questioned, Von Rotter rolled his little round eyes in a very dreadful manner, but he said nothing. \" That is the great Von Rotter,\" said one of the clerks. \u00ab Very well,\" said Wurtem. * I will CHAPTER XX. A. GREAT CHANGE TAKES PLACE IN WURTEM CARLIS. According to the old trades' law of Amsterdam, if a banker did not honour a cheque upon him, the holder of it could come and close his doors and fasten them up from the outside until the affairs of the house wereproperly in vestigated, and although Wurtem Carlis had not the least idea of doing such a thing with the doubtful order that he had for the one hundred guilders, yet the threat had its effect upon the commercial minds of those about him. \"Oh, let him see Mynheer Von Rotter,\" said one. \" You, Treb, run for the guard, for he will be given into their custody, no doubt, as an impostor and a robber; but let Mynheer Vou Rotter do that himself, and then it will be sure to be right.\" \" I demand to see tlie banker, Vou Hotter,\" saidWurteiru"], [80, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 70 power that the name of Jan-Van Van- Jan had upon the great Von Rotter. Summoning all his calmness, the young man spoke. \" I bear no malice to any one,\" he said, \"but let me hope for the future, that poverty will not be considered such a crime as you all of you appeared to think it, until you discover whether it be the result of misfortune or of real criminality. Think no more of the past, and allow me to assist you to rise, Mynheer Von Rotter.\" take your word for it, although the little fat man will not tell me himself.\" Von Rotter uttered a curious kind of howl at this, and Wurtem continued,\u2014 \" I have an order for money.\" His voice faltered a little as he spoke, for the dread then came over him that the slip of paper he had received from the stran ger might be worthless. At the idea of any one with such a shabby coat as poor Wurtem Carlis's was, having an order for money, every body laughed, and Von Rotter looked properly indignant. \" Who has gone for the guard ?\" he said. \" Kicki, great sir !\" replied one. \"It is good. Yah! We will give this bad character into custody. Yah ! Fuff ! Hem ! Ha !\" When the clerks heard these ioter jectional remarks from the great Von Rotter, they knew that affairs were se rious, and they would not have been at all surprised if the good City of Amster dam had slightly shaken, or if any other natural phenomena had taken place of a sympathetic nature to the anger of the great Von Rotter. \" He says he has an order for money 1\" gasped the banker, then ; and something that nature may have originally intended for a sardonic kind of grin, passed like a ripple over the surface of tbe great face of the great Von Rotter. \"Yes,\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"and here it is.\" The banker was helped to his feet, and the clerks all bowed in a semi circle round Wurtem Carlis, who was nearly bewildered by the scene, and more than once suspected that it was but a dream after all, and that he would awaken and find himself perhaps on board of the San Nicholas, far out at sea, or, at all events, on the door- step of the great old wooden house whither he had crept to rest his wearied limbs. \"Come into my private counting house,\" said Von Rotter. \" Come, my good friend \u2014 oh, come. Bring a hundred guilders here, Kreken I\" \"Yes, Mynheer,\" said the cashier, \"directly.\" Von Rotter had the money for Wur tem Carlis, who followed him into a little dingy-room, in which the old banker was wont to conduct his own private business. A chair was handed to Wurtem, and then, as he stood humbly before him, Von Rotter said \u2014 \"Oh, Mynheer, shall you see Jan- Van Van-Jan soon ?\" He handed the little torn and jagged edged scrap of paper to Von Rotter, who deliberately placed across his nose an immense pair of spectacles. He looked at the paper for about half a minute, and then he let the spectacles fall smash to the floor, and he was taken with a fit of trembling, that astonished and alarmed all who were present. \"Oh, Mynheer!\" he said. \"Oh, Mynheer, pardon \u2014 pardon,\" and the great Von Rotter fell plump upon his knees, and shook the whole of the house. \"Pardon \u2014 pardon' You are the friend of Jan-Van Vau-Jan, and that is more than enough ; you are welcome to the heart and inside of Von Rotter !\" Wurtem nodded. \"You \u2014 you \u2014 will not tell him ex actly \u2014 Ob, you will not \" \"1 understand you,\" said Wurtem \"I will say nothing to him of the character of my reception here, you may depend.\" \" How can I thank you Mynheer, a \u2014 a \" The banker looked at the cheque again to refresh his memory with the name of his guest, and then he added \u2014 \" Wurtem Carlis. Oh, are you any relation to the Carlises who \u2014 who \" Upon hearing these words, then, the clerks all shrank back in amazement and terror, and Wurtem Carlis himself was not a little astonished at the wonderful \" Who were once great merchants, and who are now ruined ! Yes, I am the last of that stock, and the only repre sentative of that ruined race.\""], [81, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 71 \"Yah! But you are the friend of Jan- Van Van- Jan?\" The merchant again looked, at the cheque, to. be quite sure that the word \"friend\" was there, and then, being satisfied that his eyes had not at all deceived him, he made a comical sort of plunge forwa.rd, and caught Wurtem by the hand, saying\u2014 \" Mynheer Carlis, I too, will be your friend, aud, you may draw upon my house for what you like. If you think ten or twenty thousand guilders will re store the fortune of your house, you shalt have them.\" Poor Wurtem passed his hand across his eyes. He began to feel now more than ever that this was one of those glittering dreams with which fortune mocks the poor and destitute. \" Yes, Mynheer Carlis, or forty thou sand guilders,\" added Von Rotter, \"for you are the friend of Jan- Van Van-Jan.\" Oh, what would not Wurtem have given to be able to say \u2014 \" Aud who is Jan- Van Van- Jan !\" \u2014 But in the midst of all his perplexities, he felt the great impropriety of asking such a question as that, which might do him the greatest injury, by expressing his own ignorance of who his important friend really was. \"You are very kind, Mynheer,\" said Wurtem Carlis. \" You are very kind, indeed, to me, and 1 will consider of it.\" \" Now, who on earth can this Jan- Van Van-Jan be?\" thought Wurtem; but the more he racked his brain to think who he could be, the more at a loss he was upon the subject. The hundred guilders were brought to him respect fully, in a little bag, and just as he placed them in his pocket, poor Wurtem felt sick and faint with hunger. \" Mynheer Von Rotter,\" he said, \" I am in the habit of breakfasting early \u2014 when I can get any,\" added Carlis to himself \u2014 \" and my hour is past, and lam faint for want of refreshment.\" The banker actually howled at the idea of the friend of Jan-Van Van-Jan being faint for want of refreshment. It was too terrible a though. He caught up a little silver bell that was upon his table, and began to ring it at a rate that brought a couple of clerks into the room in a moment. \" Go !\" cried the banker. \" Go to meine good sister, and tell her that the best breakfast that can be laid for the best friend of Von Rotter and Co., is to be got ready at once. Go \u2014 go !\" '\\I regret,\" said Wurtem, \" to give you all this trouble.\" \" Trouble ! trouble ! Meine Got ! the trouble would be if you did not break fast with Von Rotter. Come up-stairs, meine young friend \u2014 come ! Oh, this is quite a happy day for thee. Von Rotter ! The contract! Ah ! the contract ! Ah!\" \" Do, my dear young friend, do ; and when you speak to Jau-Van Van-Jan, if you will say that Von Rotter is your friend, I \u2014 shall be so happy. Meine Got ! yes \u2014 The contract i\" What Von Rotter meant by the con tract, Wurtem Carlis had not the least idea of, but he quite understood that the banker was exceedingly solicitious to bespeak his good offices with Jan- Van Van-Jan, and that he would do anything for him upon that account. \"You may depend upon me saying everything that I possibly can,\" he re plied, \" in the favour of one who is so very kind to me as Mynheer Von Rotter.\" \"What on earth can he mean by 'The Contract?' \" thought Wurtem Car lis. \"Bnt, at all events, if this he a happy day for thee, Rotter, it is surely anything but a bad one for thee, Carlis. Fortune is surely at length tired of tor menting me !\" The half-famished young man followed the banker to the festive apartments of his house, which were upon the upper floor. CHAPTER XXI. RETURNS TO VANDERDECKEN. \" Oh, meine friend \u2014 meine friend !\" The banker was so overcome with joy at these words of Wurtem Carlis, that he was compelled to stragger into a seat and fan himself with the case of the cash-book, that lay conveniently close to his face upon the table. We left Vanderdecken upon -the threshold of Von Straken's breakfast room at a time when no one could be more thoroughly unexpected than he. The consternation of the merchant was most excessive, and even the young and air Whilelmina, although she could not"], [82, "VANDERDECKEN. 72 that might enable her to name it her self. y \u25a0 \" My name is Diderich,\" said Van dcrdcckcn \" Ah, I think I heard as much before.\" \" Mayhap you did, fair one; but there is nothing in the name that should make you dread it, is there ? Your father knows me well, as an old friend, although the wind and the waves have not be haved kindly to me of late, and I have much need of all the compassion that kind and gentle hearts can bestow upon me. There was so much pathos in the tone in wbich these words were uttered, that Whilelmina could not help in her gentle heart feeling a sensation of pity for the stranger. \"My father,\" she said, \"is rich, and well-esteemed in Amsterdam. He has the good opinion of all men, and if you are unfortunate, and he knows you to be deserving, he will do much for you.\" \" I am much beholden to the Mynheer Von Straken already,\" said the stranger, with a slight inclination of the head, \" and it is a great thing to find his child so full of holy compassion. Ob, maiden, let me tell you, and I know it to be a truth, that gentle pity is a more lauda- ble thing than all your beauty: that one tear which you may shed in real sympathy with human sorrow, is of more account in Heaven than all the gold and jewels wbich the great world pos sesses.\" tell herself that she had anything to fear from the mysterious man, turned rather pale, and trembled at his sudden and most unlooked-for appearance. That the person whom they were sure had got into a large chest and from that entirely disappeared sliould now again appear in the breakfast-room, was mys tery upon mystery that certainly would have puzzled wiser heads than either those of Von Straken or his daughter. The melancholy smile that Vander decken's was, was yet such as was unac countably touching, and ought to have won for him some sympathy from all who saw it. Whilelmina was the first to repover from the great surprise into which his sudden appearance had thrown her, and with more courage than we would have thought she would have been capable of exhibiting, she cried out to him \u2014 \" Who and what are you ? Why do you come here to make my father un happy ? What is it that you want in this house?\" The stranger replied at first by the strange melancholy smile again, and then advancing and lightly touching the arm of the young girl with one finger, he sang, or rather chaunted, the follow- ing lines\u2014 \"The yming and the happy, The brave and the true, With soft eyes of love Will oft look upon you ; But, ah ! who can love yon Liko that blighted son], Who looks on your beauty, And feels its control?\" There was quite a fascination in the manner in which these words were spoken\u2014 it was so very evident that they came direct from the heart of the stranger, and that they were anything but hypocritical. \" I will leave you, Mynheer, with mv father,\" said Whilelmina, \"who win better understand your wants than I can; but \" I \" Ah, me ! maiden fair ! do not ch, do not gaze into my eyes with an un friendly aspect. The admiration of any heart, however humble, is a compliment that the brightest beauty in all the world might well appreciate, and feel a kindly sensation in acknowledging.\" Whilelmina could not say anything harsh in reply to all this, but she felt, with a shudder, that she would be much better pleased if the mysterious stranger would leave the place. That was what he had evidently no intention to do. \" Say on maiden\u2014 say on.\" \" Was it a dream, father, that this man last night disappeared, as no human being could have disappeared i\" Vanderdecken shuddered. The old merchant gave a slight groan, as he said\u2014 \"What is his name, father?\" said Whilelmina, passing her hands over her eyes as she asked the question, as though she were trying to recollect something \" Meine child, the safest and the best way is to consider it a dream.\" \" Like a dream,\" said Vanderdecken, in a hollow tone."], [83, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 73 Whilelmina said no more, but she left the room ; and yet as she went, it would seem, if we might judge by the pro longed gaze, that she found it difficult to take her cyes.off the face of the stranger.

Listen to me, Mynheer Diderich. As I tell you, I only used one of your jewels. My heart failed me when I often thought of extending my enterprises and of in creasing my wealth, by using the others ; but I withstood the temptation so to do, and they are all here.\" As he spoke, Mynheer Von Straken took from his pocket a carefully folded piece of leather, and having unwrapped it, he produced the exquisite jewels that had been intrusted to him by Vander decken. The old man's eyes glistened as he looked at them. and paler, until his face was ghastly, and white beyond all mortal whiteness. The interim that ensued was too irk some to Von Straken for him not to break it ; and after a pause, he said\u2014 \" Oh, Mynheer, what have I done to you that you should be the bane of my home in this way ? I have been thinking, and I can give you bills for the full value of the jewels that I had belonging to you. Yes, I will give you bills, and they will be duly honoured, and then you and I will be clear with each other for ever and a day.\" \" There was no talk of bills in our agreement,\" said the mysterious man. \" No\u2014 no.

But know, oh, foolish old man ! that not you, nor a hundred like you, could let out from this mortal fabric my spirit ! Do not use your sword with such ideas in the time to come. It may not be done ; and it is but loading your heart with guilty thoughts that can give you no recom pense in this world or in the next.\" \" Meine Got !\" gasped Von Straken. \"Most solemnly 1 assure you of this!\" \" I hear, Mynheer\u2014 I hear you ! Oh, say no more !\" \" It is well. My nature is not one that bears malice for such an evil. Oh, would that you could only \u2014 \" Vanderdecken paused, and clasped his hands together, and then a strange kind of convulsion passed over his fea tures, which lasted for a moment or two, when all was still and calm and white and glassy-looking again. \" Here is enough,\" he said, \"to pur chase the crown of Holland.

They will not rot and they will not even lose their tex ture where they are; but they shall not come forth to breed dissension among the sons of man.\" CHAPTER XXII. A WIDOW CALLS UPON IDE MERCHANT. Tap ! tap ! came some one to the merchant's door at- this moment, and in a few moments more the handle of the breakfast-room door was turned, and a female face peeped in. \"Bushels!\" The idea of there being bushels of diamonds to be had for the grasping, even though they were at the bottom of the Indian Ocean, had evidently for the time, come between the old merchant and his wits. \"Peace, Von Straken,\" said the stranger, \" and do not let your whole soul be so absorbed in the love of gold as to make you forget all other feelings and sensation that should belong to human nature. Your daughter ?\" \" Oh, my daughter\u2014 yes, my child\u2014 my child!\" The old man dropped his pipe, and rocked to and fro upon his chair. Then suddenly looking up, he said \u2014 \" No, I would not sell my child for a bushel of diamonds.\" This face belonged to no other than the widow who, on the preceding eve ning, had been one of the guests of Mynheer Von Straken, and who, it will be recollected, had carried off the little bit of coral, the possession of which had such strange effects in favour of Vander decken upon any one who might have it. Without waiting for any question to be put to her, the widow cried out, as she looked into the room,\u2014 \" Mynheer Von Straken, I have come to ask you where that dear, delightful man is who came to you last evening, and was saved from the wreck. I have not been able to sleep for thinking of him all night long, I assure you, aud\u2014 OhT\" ' . , The widow had got thus far, in her hurry to speak, without notiein? that the dear delightful man she mentioned was in the room, and to all appearauca alone too, for Von Straken had rolled under the table, and there he lay in its shadow out of sight from the part of the room next to the door. \" I am here,\" said Vanderdecken. \u00abOh\u2014 oh!\" said the widow, \"that ever I should have said what I have, and allowed any human man to know that I 01), dear me, what will you think of me, sir !\" . \"Just what I thought before, said Vanderdecken. \" 'Tis well.\" \" Take back the remains of your jewels, Mynheer Diderich. There they are all but the one that I parted with to provide me capital wherewith to be come the rich merchant that I am\u2014 for I am rich. Take them all back, and sue me for the value of the one I have used.\" \"Do you forget, old man, that we have a written agreement, in which the whole of these jewels, with their weight and value, are described, and that the conditions of vour having them all were that 1 was to be the husband of your daughter?\" . \" I do not forget. Oh ! I wish I did ! But there they are all but the one I have used. Take them.\" Vanderdecken took the jewels, and after running them through his fingers for a moment or two, he cast them into the wood fire that was blazing and crack ling upon the hearth. An explosion immediately ensued that shook thehou3e, and iu nine brilliant sparks, like ascend ing stars, the jewels dashed up the wide chimney and were gone 1 Von Slraken fell flat upon his face upon the floor, for now he gave himself up for lost, indeed. \" How fascinating !\" said the widow, in an audible voice, aside. \" Whac beautiful eyes he has, and what a grac_; there is in his movements, to be sure ! What a voice, too. Oh, Mynheer! Oh\u2014 oh !\" - , , , . She sank into a chair, and looked a~_ languishing as possible at Vander decken, who slowly approached her. \" And is it, possible, madam, he said, \" that you have come to see me ?\" \"Must I confess ?\" \" Certainly.\" ' * ' \u25a0: T \"Then I confess to the truth when i say that I have, you delightful man !"], [86, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 76 it \" Not a doubt of it. Show it to me.\" The widow, with a good deal of co quetry, took the little piece of coral from her bosom and handed it to Van derdecken, who looked her in the face the moment he got it, and waited in silence to hear and see what effect the abstraction of the magic coral from her possession would have upon her feelings with regard to him. \" Humph ! Then you love me, and you would have no objection to wed me, I daresay, madam ?\" \" Ob, how percipitate you are, to be sure ! Are you sure nobody will come ? Wouldn't it be better to lock the door ?\" \" Not at all. I have come expressly to Amsterdam for a wife.\" , \" Oh, you charming man ! The very image of my last husband, to be sure \u2014 only much handsomer by a great deal ! And so you really think of marrying in Amsterdam ?\" \"I do; and before I make you an offer, I have but one question to ask of you, and I sincerely hope you will not be offended at it.\" \" It is quite impossible I can be of fended at anything you may say.\" \" Well, as I tell you, madam, I have determined upon marrying in Amster dam, if I can ; but I am rather choite, and there is one condition which is what I will not and cannot depart from ; and unless circumstances are such beforehand as to make me feel quite secure upon the point, I am compelled plumply to ask the question.\" \"Oh, ask it! What is it?\" ..^ \" I must marry a maid !\" , '.. \"J \"A what?\" \" A maid. Surely you have heard of such a thing even in Amsterdam ?\" \" Gracious !\" The effect was speedy enough, and sufficiently significant to be most sur prising. The whole expression of the countenance of the charming widow in a moment altered, and she looked at Vanderdecken with a shudder of horror. \"Good gracious,\" she said, \"why am I here ?\" \" I do not know, madam !\" \" How could I for one moment\u2014 oh, dear ! Why, the man is a perfect fright, and looks as if he had been dead and buried for a hundred years, at the least, and dug up again then and let walk about. Don't come near me, you horrid, uncomfortable-looking wretch, don't!\" \"AUow me to show you to the door,\" said Vanderdecken. The widow arose with many shudders, and made what haste she could from the house, ejaculating to herself her own wonder that she had ever come to it upon such an errand. Vanderdecken looked after her with a strange smile, and then closing the door of the apart ment, he crept back in the odd, noiseless manner in which he walked, to the mer chant, who by this time was sitting upon the floor under the table. \" Rise, Von Straken.\" \" The Lord be merciful to me. Amen !\" \" If you cannot come up to that de scription, madam, you will be so good as to consider that you cannot have me, and that I would not have you if you could offer me the whole of Amsterdam as a bribe to say, ' Will you be my wife ?' \" The widow felt a little fired. \"You wretch!\" she said, \"I did, I own, like you a little, but I don't now\u2014 And yet \u2014 oh, you are only joking ! I feel sure of that, you handsome, seducing man ! You are only joking !\" \" You bave a little bit of rook coral belonging to me, madam ?\" \"Rise, I say. The time has come when it is proper that you and I should fully and clearly understand each other. By the conditions of the bond that is between us, you are answerable for the whole of the jewels.\" The merchant groaned. \" And if you attempt, by any shuffling or evasion, to escape from your share of the compact, I will immediately go to the syndic, and have your doors shut up as a fraudulent merchant. You know well that I can do so, as the bond that I have in your own hand is sufficient \" Oh, yes, I have it here in my bosom. It is a small piece only, and will you believe me when I tell you, that I took it home in remembrance of you, and placed it under my pillow all night long.\" \" I am sure of it.\" \" And I did nothing but dream of you from night till morning.\""], [87, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 77 for me to proceed upon in such a matter at once.\" Let it be a clear understanding between us that such should be the case, and if you can't consent to such a course, say the word, man, and I will go now and lodge my complaint concerning the pearls with the syndic, and you know the con sequences \u2014 You are lost !\" \" Oh, no\u2014 no ! Anything but that ! A ruined merchant\u2014 the jest of every idle tongue \u2014 imprisoned in the damp cells of the old quay prison, for not paying what I never owed ! Ob, no \u2014 no ! It is better to die at once.\" \" Mercy !\" \" I can say nothing\u2014 think of nothing but mv agreement.\" \"Then all is lost\u2014 all is lost !'* * \" Rise, I say, and speak to me like a man. All is not lost.\" The old merchant contrived, after rolling about a little like some immense brewer's butt upon a smooth pavement, to get upon his feet at last ; and then he sank into the recesses of his huge chair again, and looked at Vanderdecken with such an expression of utter despair, as in the period of his greatest poverty, some fifteen years ago, had never sat upon his face. \" Is there no hope ?\" he said. \" Yes, abundance of hope !\" \" Oh, tell me where I am to find it !\u2014 Tell me what it is, and how I am to seek it, for I cannot face ruin and disgrace !\" \" Your daughter will be my bride.\" \" Alas ! alas !\" \" No, it is better to try to do your best to accomplish my wishes. T?hink again. Mynheer Von Straken.\" Tbe old merchant gasped several times like some great fish who finds air not so congenial to him as water, and then he just managed to say\u2014 \" I\u2014i\u2014wiU\u2014i will\u2014 Yes, I will.\" \"Then, that is settled. We under stand each other.\" The slight flush of a radiant smile came over the face of Vanderdecken, as he uttered these words. There seemed to be induced a hops now in the heart of the unhappy man that he might escape the further progress of the dreadful doom that he had been con demned to. \" She holds Tom Simpson in contempt, and be who really loves her for herself alone is poor.\" \" Wurtem Carlis ?\" \" To be sure. She will wed neither of them. Despite all your authority in the matter, she will not wed the English man you have, for commercial purposes, pitched upon as her husband ; and Wur tem Carlis you will not allow her to think of, on account of his poverty. Is it not so?\" \"Mynheer Von Straken,\" he said, in a tone of conciliation and kindness, \"you will not regret this acquiescence in my wishes. From this time I count upon your using all your influence with Whilelmina in my favour, and I beg you not to doubt the result. But now let me warn you, my friend, that if you are so ill-advised by your passions and by your cupidity as to attempt to play me false, your fate will be a fearful one, for, be assured, that I shall know even your thoughts.\" The disconsolate Von Straken looked at him for a few moments in silence, and then he said \u2014 \" Yes ; oh, yes, it is !\" \" Then, there remains only myself to lead her to the altar.\" \" But if she will not ?\" \" You must exert your authority, and that, combined with ray promises, will suffice.\" \" Never\u2014 never !\" \" You will not ?\" \" No. Do not misunderstand me. I wish to say that such would not suffice. She will not be persuaded by you nor by me. She can't love you.\" \" A shallow argument ! She could not love the man you were intent upon her marrying, and yet you had the mar riage all but over when I came to you yesternight. Is it not so, Von Straken? Do not tell me that she cannot love me as a reason. I say that my own persuasions, backed by your commands, will suffice. \" Will you tell me if\u2014 if\u2014 \" \"If what?\" \" If you are really Didsrich Vander decken or not ?\" \"Seek no further knowledge than that which it is good that you should hear, Von Straken. Be content that you shall have one hour after the wedding a bushel of diamonds.\" \" A bushel \u2014 a whole bushel 1 Oh meine Got, a whole bushel of diamonds !"], [88, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 78 He was now the guest and the cherished friend of the great Amsterdam banker, Von Rotter. What a change was that! That is much. A bushel ! You will give me good measure, too, no doubt, meme good friend ?\" Only a few short hours before, Wurtem Carlis had wondered where he should procure a breakfast ; but now, by the almost magical power of the great Jan- Van Van-Jan, he was loaded with atten tions by the man whose door-step had been considered too good a resting-place for the poor houseless wanderer to rest upon. We shall see what is a very rare thing indeed, namely, that Wurtem Carlis can bear with prosperity as well as he did with adversity; for, strange to say, human nature can generally behave itself much better under the latter of the conditions than the former. CHAPTER XXIII. SHOWS HOW WURTEM CARLIS ROSE IN THE WORLD. It is quite clear, that the course of true love runs not a whit smoother in Hol land than it does in England ; and poor Whilelmina and her fond and faithful lover, Wurtem Carlis, experienced the truth of the fact, that the heart's best roses are ever the most beset by thorns. We presume that by this time the sagacious reader has perceived that the character of Von Straken, the great merchant of Amsterdam, was a strange compound of avarice and fear, and that there was along with that compound only one other feeling which now and then disturbed its operation, and that was a species of affection for his daughter Whilelmina, which, while it was not strong enough to overrule his craft and avarice, was just of sufficient power to disarrange his actions and ideas. Probably, Vanderdecken quickly enough found out that such was the state of the case ; and no doubt suspect ing, or more than suspecting, that avarice, after all, might be more successfully appealed to than any other passion of the merchant's heart, he had made him the offer of the bushel of diamonds, that had come quite between him and his wits with their gorgeous glitter even in imagination: And poor Whilelmina was to be the victim of all this covetousness upon the part of her father, provided he could think of any means of inducing her to break her faith with Wurtem Carlis, whom she really loved. It was quite evident that the chances of Tom Simpson and Co. becoming the son-in-law of the great Amsterdam merchant were hourly becoming less and less. \" I do no't know, Mynheer Von Rotter,\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"how I can repay you for all your kindness to me.\" \" Mynheer, you can repay me.\" \"But how?\" \" The contract \u2014 the contract!\" \" I have heard you utter that word, ' contract,' several times before, but I do not understand what you mean by it.\" \" Then I will tell you. What I want you to do, Mynheer Carlis, is to say to Jan- Van Van-Jan \u2014 ' Will you give Von Rotter the dyke contract ?' \" \" The dyke contract ?\" \" Yes, Mynheer, 1 will explain. The contract for the repair of the dykos and drains of the coast is given each year to some wealthy citizen of the States of Holland, and I want it this year.\" \" And can Jan-Van \u2014 \" Here Wur tem paused, for he thought it would be very indiscreet to get up the suspicion in the mind of the banker that he did not kuDw who his great friend Jan- Van was. \" Ah, Mynheer !\" added Von Rotter, \"you were going to say, ' Can Jau-Van do so much for friendship's sake ?' Yah ! he can, and he will, if you ask him.\" '\u2022 But what makes you so anxious about this contract ?\" said Wurtem Carlis ; \" for I have heard that it is <^uite a speculation, and that in nine cases out of ten, those who undertake it are ruined by it.\" But it is to Wurtem Carlis that we must now return. We left that estimable young man in a very different position to any that he had occupied for a considerable time. 'Ah!\" \" It was one of the things, combined with others, that brought the family of the"], [89, "THE PLYING DUTCHMAN. 79 \" Yes, Mynheer ; so, you see, that if I take the contract at the old price, I shall make a charming profit.\" \" Now, indeed, I understand you.\" \"Meine Got, yes. Of course you do. Ah, and now Jet me tell you, Mynheer Carlis, what I will do for you !\" Wurtem was silent, for he considered now that he was placed in a very awk- ward situation, for he had promised to keep a secret which, if he asked Jan- Van for the contract, it would hardly be honourable for hira to withhold from that individual. \" Yes,\" added the banker. \" I will tell you what I will do for you, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis. I will give you five thousand guilders.\" \"No!\" said Carlis. \"No?\" \" Not one guilder, Von Rotter. But now, since you are disposed to do me a good turn, I will point out to you what you may do.\" \"Meine young friend, I listen with all my long ears. Go on.\" \"The adversity that I have gone through has taught me much more than prosperity would have taught me, and I think now, that if I had a little capital, that I could go into the old house of my family, and do well. There are yet many of the merchants, both here and in the east, who are well dis- posed towards me, for the sake of my family, which in old times they knew eo well and respected. I repeat, then \u2014 if I had capital to do so, I would again try if the name of Carlis might not once more be named among the princely merchants of Amsterdam.\" . Good,\" said Von Rotter. \"I understand well the export and import trade of the States, but I know that no good is to be done unless one is the owner of the craft that carries the goods ; and so, I repeat, I want capital.\" \" Good again.\" \"If, therefore, upon my bond, you will supply me with a sufficient sum to try my fortune, I am certain that I can repay it to you, with interest, in the course of time.\" \"Mynheer, how much ?\" \" The sum of five thousand guilders, that you mentioned even now, would, I think, suffice.\" \" Listen, Mynheer Carlis. I have Carlises from being princely merchants to being what they are in my own per- son, I being the last of the race.\" \" What, you are, Mynheer ? Why, are you not the friend of Jan- Van?\" \" True ; but that is all.\" \"All ! Meine Got ! is not that enough, and more than euough ? Oh, Mynheer ! what more would you have? But the contract \u2014 the contract ! Speak to me Mynheer, of the contract !\" \"I have all the disposition in the world to oblige you, but really I am so anxious about my future prospects, that I know not what to say at present to any one.\" '' Mynheer Carlis, if you are at all anxious about your future prospects, it can only be your great modesty that makes you so, for are you not the friend of Jan- Van 1 Ah, yes ! Meine Got ! yes !\" Now, Wurtem Carlis would have given anything in reason if, consistently with common prudence, he could only have said to Von Rotter \u2014 \"For Heaven's sake, tell me who and what this Jan- Van is !\" But the idea haunted him that if he were to utter these words, he would lose his influence with the banker \u2014 an influence that might be so successfully courted in a variety of ways, for the good both of himself and others, so he carefully abstained from doing auy such thing. But still, although Wurtem had prudence enough to ask no questions, he kept his eyes and his ears open to receive any chance information. \" Mynheer Von Rotter,\" he said, \" to revert to this contract about the dykes : I am very much afraid, after all, that I should be doing you but a very question- able service in engaging Jan- Van to use his interest for you in the matter.\" \"No \u2014 no \u2014 no, meine good young friend \u2014 it would be no questionable ser vice at all, but a real good service, as I shall tell to you now, upon your own good word of honour to keep the secret.\" \" That I freely give you.\" \" Then I will\" tell you. The conser vation of the dykes has always been a loosing affair to the contractors ; but [ am in possession of a secret process ;hat will do the work much more effec tually than it has ever been done, at jbout one third of the expense.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" I"], [90, "80 VANDERDECKEN. description of Truchden, the banker's daughter, was not all exaggerated. \" She comes !\" said von Rotter. \" She comes !\" faith in you. You may draw upon my house for ten thousand guilders, in such sums as may suit your convenience, and all I sliall require of you will be vour acknowledgment of the debt.\" \" Can you be so generous ?\" \" Yes, meine good friend ; and\u2014 and \u2014 you will speak to Jan- Van about the\u2014 the little \" As he spoke, the door of the room was opened, and Truchden made her appear ance, and actually verified her father's description, by coming sideways into the room. \" Contract ? Yes, I will assuredly. I will ask it of him as a favour for you, the next time I see him.\" \" There !\" said Von Rotter, as he pointed to her. \" There !\" \" A stranger here ?\" said Truchden. \"Oh, father!\" Now, while Truchden is struck almost speechless at the sight of Wurtem Car lis, we may be indulged for a very few minutes, while we attempt a slight de scription of the young lady. Von Rotter embraced Carlis at once, and then in a loud voice, he called out\u2014 \"Truchden\u2014 Truchden I\" Wurtem wondered very much who the banker was calling, but in a few moments an old woman made her ap pearance, to whom Von Rotter said\u2014 \" Where is meine child Truchden ?\" The complexion of Truchden was very fair, indeed, and her hair was of that faint, flaxencDlour, such as is very popular upon the heads of children's dolls, and resembles tow more than anything else. She was just four feet in height, and\u2014 we are really afraid to say how many feet in width. She had little sleepy looking eyes ; and, in fact, take Truchden altogether, she looked more like a fillet of veal upon little feet, than anything else ; and yet she was young, and the mouth pretty, and the teeth white, and there was a good-tempered look about the faee, fat as it was. \"In her room, Mynheer,\" was the reply. \u00bb \" Bid her come hither at once, for, meine Got, I want her.\" \"Yab, Mynheer,\" said the old wo man. \" Pray, who is Truchden ?\" said Wur tem Carlis. \" Ah, meine friend,\" said the banker, wiping away, with the cuff of his most capacious coat, the tears that now gathered to his eyes, either from the delight of expecting the contract for the conservation of the dykes, or paternal affection. \"Ah, meine friend, Truchden is meine only child, and the most beauti ful maiden in all Amsterdam.\" \"Meine darling child!\" said Von Rotter, after he had waited a reasonable time for Wurtem Carlis to be thoroughly struck with the beauty of his daughter, \" meine darling Truchden ! this is Myn heer Wurtem Carlis, your father's best friend, and it is my particular desire that you embrace him at once.\" At this, Wurtem thought of Whilel mina, and he coughed slightly, by way of indicating that he dissented just a little from any such idea. \"Do I say,\" continued Von Rotter, \" that she is the most beautiful damsel in all Amsterdam ? Do I say that ?\" \"You did say it.\" \" Then I was wrong, for I ought to have said she was the most beautiful damsel in all the world.\" Now, our readers are well aware that Wurtem Carlis was by no means a bad looking young man, and Truchden had two eyes in her head, although they were little ones ; so she at once, with an obedience that did her a deal of credit, advanced to obey the mandate of her father. \" Hem !\" \" Yes ; she is so fat, she has to come in sideways at that door.\" \" You don't say so !\" \"It is a solemn fact\u2014 an immense fact.\" \" Rather a greasy fact,\" thought Wur tem Carlis ; but he contented himself by just inclining his head, to signify that he had no doubt whatever but that the Wurtem was rather alarmed, to tell tbe truth, and although he had risen upon the entrance of the young lady, he now shrunk back till he got to his chair again, and as he could get no further, down he sat upon it ; but that did not save him. \"Father,\" said Truchden, \"it shall"], [91, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 81 never be said that your own child did not do as you bade her.\" With this, she flung herself plump into Wurtem Carlis's arms, and as the chair could not stand the double weight, over it went backwards with them both, and poor Wurtem found himself ver/ nearly smothered by the fair Truchden s weight upon him- \" Oh, meine child \u2014 meine child ! \" crifH the merchant. Truchden gave a slight scream and THE ATTACK UPON JAN-VAN BY THE ROBBER. rolled off Wurtem Carlis, and there she lay kicking with her little legs on the floor, until Wurtem and the merchant together got her up and placed her in a chair. \" I sincerely hope you are not hurt ? said Wurtem Carlis. \" Oh, no\u2014 no,\" said Von Rotter. \" It was the chair upset in a very mysterious way,\" added Wurtem, and No. 11."], [92, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 82 then glancing at it, he saw how it had happened, for the back of tbe chair had given way, so they had both naturally enough rolled out of it. Truchden began to cry. \" Pray do not let this little accident afffect you,\" said Wurtem Carlis. \" It rather ought to be laughed at than made a subject for tears.\" \" But what must you think of me ?\" said Truchden. directing Wurtem how he was to go, and rubbing his hands together all the time in great apparent satisfaction. \" To the right, Mynheer Carlis \u2014 to the right \u2014 You will see the other flight of stairs before you \u2014 that is the way \u2014 Oh, meine dear child, I hope she will be better. That is right \u2014 the first door to the left, Mynheer Carlis\u2014 Oh, my beautiful Truchden, that she should be ill at such a time, too !\" Wurtem, now that he fairly bad the lovely Truchden in his arms, thought that it would be rather an unmanly thin\":, besides treatins? her, probably, very cruel, to let her go again ; so he held by her voluminous clothing as well as he could, and obeying the directions of the banker, he at last pushed open a door with his foot, and entered a bed cham ber. \" Nothing, but that you are a very\" \u2014 fat, Wurtem was going to say, but he corrected himself, and substituted charming for the more objectionable word. \"Nothing, but that you are a very charming young lady.\" Truchden looked languishingly at him. \" You don't mean it ?\" \" Oh, yes, I do.\" \"Ha! ha!\" cried Von Rotter. \"He At that moment the banker cried out- does mean it, meine dear Truchden. He does mean it \u2014 all the world means it, and he is my best friend.\" \"I feel rather faint,\" said Truchden. \"Then, meine good friend, Wurtem Carlis, will carry you to your chamber. It is only up two pair of stairs.\" \"1 am getting worse,\" said Truch den. \" Ah, I am wanted down stairs. My J bell is ringing. I am wanted in meine counting-house, directly. How happy I am that I can trust meine beautiful Truchden with meine dear friend, Mynheer Carlis.\" With these words, which Wnrtem oould not but overhear, the banker hobbled down stairs again, leaving him, Wurtem, in what might be call a very agonised situation. \"What the deuce shall I do?\" he thought; and then he said aloud. \" Where is tbe old woman, I wonder ?\" Truchden said not a word. \" Carry her ?\" said Wurtem. \" I\u2014 I really don't think I could. It would take a very strong\" \u2014 crane he was going to isay, but he added \u2014 \" man indeed.\" \" Meine Got ! no !\" cried Von Rotter. \"Try, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis \u2014 try. She is not heavy, the dear Truchden. Ou, carry her to her room, my friend. I can trust you, as you are my dear friend. Speak to me, meine child. Shall Mynheer Wurtem Carlis carry you to vour room V \" What can I do with her,\" said Wurtem aloud. \"Iliad better, I suppose, plaoe her upon the bed, poor thing, for she cannot stand or sit ; and then I will go to the head of the stairs and call for assistance.\" \"Yes !\" said Truchden faintly. \"I must try, I suppose,\" thought Wurtem. With this idea, Wurtem Cadis ap proached the bed, and very carefully laid Truchden upon it ; but at that mo ment she recovered a little, and holding him very tightly by the sleeve of his coat, she said \u2014 \"Oh, do not leave me!\" I was a terrible job, for Wurtem was puzzled how to get hold of her ; but he did at length get her in his arms, and then staggered up the stairs with her. \" I hope you are better ?\" said Wurtem. CHAPTER XXIV. WURTEM FINDS THAT ALL IS XOT ENNO- SENCE THAT LOOKS SO. \" Yes\u2014 yes. What has happened ?\" \" I suppose you fainted, and now I am happy to see and hear that you have recovered; so I will leave you to your self, as this is your chamber ; aud I beg The great banker, Mynheer Von Rotter, followed Wurtem Carlis and Truchden some few stairs below them,"], [93, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 83 to assure you that nothing but the necessity for some one carrying you to it would have induced me to intrude upon its sacred privacy.\" Truchden still held him quite tightly by the coat, as she said, in soft, winning accents \u2014 sake, as well as for my own, to let me go-\" \" Oh, no !\" \" What can you mean by \u2014 ' Oh, no V \" \" I mean, that I cannot let you go \u2014 you have been very kind to carry me up stairs, and it would be very unkind of me to let you go.

There is no one who really loves me in this house, and I am not well enough for you to leave me to my self.\" \" I think you mistake,\" said Wurtem, \" Mistake ?

No- body is kind to me but you, Mynheer Carlis \u2014 nobody in all the world. I am a very wretched girl, indeed, I assure you !\" \" Wretched, do you say !\" \" Ob, yes, yes ! How can I be other- wise when 1 have no one to love me ? I, who am so full of love, that any one who spoke kindly to me, and was well- looking, I am quite sure I could adore !\" \" 1 hope, then, that yon will soon meet with one who is worthy of your affection,\" said Wurtem Carlis ; and he took care to speak in about as cold and formal a man- ner as he possibly could to her ; but still , she kept so fast a hold of his coat, that, without violence, it would have been im- possible for him to have got away, and it was not in the nature of Wurtem Carlis to speak harsh to any female. As long as she, Truchden, chose, there- fore, to hold him, it seemed highly pro ble that he woald have to remain. \" Yes, I feel certain that 1 should ; so I. beg you won't, think of such a thing.\" \" And this,\" thought Wurtem Carlis, \" is the innocent young Truchden, is it \u2014 the fair daughter of Von Rotter, the great banker !

You shall find that I am, indeed, too much of a gentleman, by word, or look, or action of any kind, to hint at anything improper.* \" Oh, how good of you !\" \" Then I may go, now ?\" \"No ; I am getting rather faint, again, I am afraid, and the daylight is too much for me.

At that moment, the door of the chamber, which had gradually gone shut of itself, was violently opened, and some half dozen people rushed into the room, crying out \u2014 \" Where is the villain ?\u2014 Where is the seducer ?\" \"Allow me, honoured sir,\" said a sleek, smooth-faced looking man, whom Wurtem Carlis remembered to have seen in the counting-house below. \" I can tell you, honoured sir.\" \u2022' Speak out, then.\" \" Thus commanded, I will. A short time since, I head strange, half-smo- thered cries and shrieks coming from this room, and after listening a little time, 1 got these persons to come with me as witnesses to see what they could arise from, when as we neared this chamber we heard the voice of your amiable and accomplished daughter say \u2014 ' Spare me, for my poor father's sake ! ob, spare me ! Heaven surely will pro tect me !' Upon this, we all rushed in, and we saw \" \" Oh, this is dreadful !\" cried the old woman, whom Wurtem Carlis had seen below. \" This is too shocking ! Pray go away everybody who is not married or a widower. I have got hold of him ! Oh, you vile wretch, to go about to ruin a mere child, like our pretty little deli- cate, innocent Truchden !\" With this, the old lady seized Wur- tem by the skirts of his coat, and as Truchden held him round the neck still firmly, it was a brief struggle, which ended in the skirts of the coat coming off in the hands of the old man, and she flying with them into a corner, while Wurtem rolled right over Truchden and the bed, and sat at the other side. \" Oh, this is dreadful !'' cried every body. \" Look at the seducer !\" \"Murder !\" shouted the old woman. \"Oh\u2014 oh\u2014 oh!\" \" Speak out at once ! I am an agonised father !'* \" We saw a kind of a\u2014 a\u2014 sort of a struggle going on upon the bed, between that person and the lovely Truchden.

I want to her nothing. I am assured that you are a man of honour, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis, how ever your feelings may have overcome you for a moment. I give you credit for being a man of honour ; and as after this scene the reputation of my child is lost for ever if you desert her, I give my cordial consent to yoar immediate union with her.\" \"Oh, what is all this,\" said Myn heer Von Rotter, now suddenly appear ing upon the scene of action, and look ing as innocent as possible. \"What uproar is this in my house ?

Truchden came forward, and timidly shook hands with him, and then old Von Rotter \u2014 what an old rogue that Von Rotter was ! \u2014 just like some of your pre cise men of business in the City of Lon don \u2014 shook hands with him likewise, and to all appearance the affair termina ted as amicably as possible; but yet Wurtem could not help thinking that surely all the fuss that had taken place could not be for nothing. We shall soon see whether it was for nothing or not. \" Stop !\" cried Wurtem. He might as well have said stop to the progress of the day, for the persons who were in the room, with tbe excep tion of Truch<Jen and her father, vauished as though it were a matter of life and death with them to get away as quickly as possible. Poor Wurtem looked about him with unfeigned astonishment, and then fixing his ejes upon Von Rotter, he said in rather a stern tone of voice \u2014 \" Come down stairs, Mynheer Wur tem Carlis,\" said Von Rotter ; \" we wiU leave the pretty Truchden to recover from her alarm and her agitation by herself.\" \" Pray, Mynheer, will you have the goodness to explain to me the meaning of all this?\" \" The meaning ?\" \" Yes, the meaning. That is what I want to know.\" \" As you please, sir.\" \"Ah, poor girl ! she is but a young, tender creature, Mynheer Wurtem ; and you might have done worse than make her your wife. But we will say no more about that.\" \" Mynheer Wurtem Carlis, don't you know ?\" \"I'll be hanged if I do!\" \" Then I will tell you, and I hope it will be to your gratification, that the meaning is, that I will give my free con sent to your marriage with my dear and innocent young Truchden.\" \" Mynheer Von Rotter ?\" \"Yah!\" \" I beg that you will not, Mynheer Von Rotter. The subject cannot possi bly be a grateful one, now, either to you or to me.\" '* That is true, Mynheer, so we will say no more.\" \" The banker led the way to the same room in which he and Wurtem had been sitting, before the odd little episode that we have described took place, and in the most friendly manner he made Wurtem sit down again, and resumed the conver sation about mercantile affairs with the utmost politeness, and no one would have thought, for a moment, anything had taken place between them. After about half an hour, and when Von Rotter had renewed his promise qf the loan of the ten thousand gilders, he rose, and begged Wurtem Carlis to ex cuse him for a few minutes, and then going down stairs to the counting-house, he said, in a loud voice \u2014 \" Credit Wurtem Carlis, who is to be my son-in-law, with a loan of ten thou sand gilders, that he borrows of me preceding his marriage '.\" \" With all due deference to you, and with all due respect and admiration for the beauty and the talents of the young lady, I beg leave to decline the very flattering and totally unexpected propo sal.\" \"Very well, Mynheer; there is no harm done.

AVhile these things were going on at the banqueting-house of the great Von Rotter \u2014 things which would have been so very interesting to Whilelmina Stra ken to know \u2014 that young lady was in anything but an enviable condition be tween her three admirers. Now, Mynheer Von Straken took pipe after pipe to clear his brains, hut strange to say, they had quite a contrary effect, and only muddled them more and more, and he became in such a state of grief and stupidity together, that there he sat in his own snug and well polished room, with the tobacco smoke coming out at both corners of his mouth, and the tears running down his nose. There was Tom Simpson and Co., who, notwithstanding he had begun to have his suspicions that all was not quite right yet, was in quite a fever of anxiety after all, for fear the alliance of the houses of Simpson and Straken should not take place, and all should otherwise turn out, in a commercial point of view, to be right and proper. Then, again, there was Wurtem Car lis, who most unquestionably had won the young and tender heart of tbe fair, and rather plump, Whilelmina \u2014 she did not know of his good fortune, therefore she could not tell what increased chances Alas, poor Von Straken ! What a situation for one of the wealthiest of the great princely merchants of Amsterdam to be in. As he sat there, his daughter came into the room. \"Father,\" said Whilelmina, \"will you have some luncheon ? It is quite ready. Did you speak ?\" \" No.\" \" What is the matter with you, father \u2014 surely you are not ill ?\" \" Yes, meine Got, I am.\" \" Oh dear, father, we will have the best physician in all Amsterdam. In deed, and in truth, you do look ill.\" \" I am ill, mine child, and I want no physician. You can cure me, and you only.\" \" I, father V \" Yes, you, and I will tell you how. Come hither, mine child, Whilelmina, and listen to me. I am about to tell you a great secret, indeed ; and you must keep it locked up in your own breast just as if it were so many gil ders in a box. Do you understand ?\" \" I do, father.\" It was so very seldom that Mynheer Von Straken condescended to be so metaphysical that Whilelmina might well expect that something very serious was coming, and she looked in her father's face with terrified and eager expec- such good chances ought to give him in the pursuit for her hand. And then last, although far from being the last in importance, as regards the fortunes of Whilelmina, there is Vander- decken, who, to escape the dreadfal doom that is hanging over him, would lead to the altar the young girl who was pledged to him by the father's cupidity. It will be well, indeed, if Whilelmina should escape all these troubles without much suffering. And now we will take a look at Myn heer Von Straken, who surely was in a greater state of perplexity than Dutch man was everin before, and ihe number of pipes he smoked was quite prodigious. There he was in the terrors of a dilemma, such as was surely enough to muddle the faculties of any one. How to get out of such a botheration of circumstances he had not the least idea. Commercial ruin, or the sacrifice of ; face \\ his daughter, always providing she would j tation, be willing to be sacrificed, which was by no means a clear conclusion, was the al ternative that stared him in the face. He groaned in spirit. \" Do not keep me in suspense, father,\" she said, \"but tell me all.\" \" I will \u2014 I will. Yon must know then, mine child, that this sailor man who came here, and who so very oddly went away again \" \" Through the old chest.\" \" What shall 1 do ?\" he said \"What can I do?

And, besides, father, everybody says he is \u2014 he is\u2014\" \"What ?\" _ \" Bnt, father, why do you not give him money, and send him away. He cannot want anything but money, you know, and you have plenty of that.\" \" Meine Got, I have not.\" \" You have not, father. Can this be possible.\" \" Listen, meine child. I have money's worth if I have not money, but most of my ships are at sea now with various cargoes to various parts, and while they are gone I am not a man of money, ex cept in expectancy, you see, meine child. Now, Tom Simpson and Co.\" \" Something more than a man.\" \"Well, meine child, that is better than marrying anybody who is something less.\" \" Yes ; but, father, they say he is Vanderdecken, the Flying Dutchman.\" \" The flying fiddlestick, meine child ! Did you ever hear of a respectable Dutchman flying?\u2014 let me ask you that, meine child ; and as for what idle people say, that is of no sort of consequence, meine Whilelmina. The man is rich, and will make you a capital husband.\" \" Do you mean, then, sincerely to ask me to marry that man ?\" \" Meine beautiful and gentle child, I do.\" \" Father, I will not have him. I have said it, and I will keep my word. I swear it that I will not have Tom Simp son.\" \" Meine child, I don't want you to have him I\" \"You don't, father? You really don't ?\" \" No.\" \" Oh dear, father, that is good of you. Yon, no doubt, now see by this time what a wretched cieature and a coward, too, he is. Why, he will always be as thin as he is now, I do believe, father, and you know that he would never rise to any dignity in Holland in consequence of such a glaring deficiency in his ap pearance. Besides, he is such a coward, you know, father, and I cannot bear a coward. Now, there is another who is as brave as he is handsome, aud whose father, they tell me, was such a size that he could not have got in at that door.\" \"Then I won't.\" Mynheer Von Straken dropped his pipe, and glanced at Whilelmina out of his little pig-like eyes in amazement. \" No,\" she added. \" I won't.\" \" She won't !\" gasped Von Straken. \"How like her dear departed mother she is, to be sure.\" \" No, father, I have quite made up my mind to that. I won't marry anybody that I don't love ; and, ab, me ! I love but one.\" \" And that one is \u2014 is \u2014 \u2014 \" \"My dear Wurtem Carlis.\" \" Without a farthing !\" \"Ah ! but I love him, for all that ; and you are rich, father. You only say all this to try your Whilelmina's heart, that is all, and at the end of it you will send for poor Wurtem.\" \" Will I ?\" \" Oh, oh !\" \"Why do you say, 'Oh!' father? You know that it is to the young and handsome Wurtem Carlis that I now allude.\" \" ldo know it ; but you will not allude to him again, after I have told you that which I nave to tell you.

A hat of somewhat darker coloured velvet, with a large single feather of the brightest crimson, and a loop composed of four diamonds of the most dazzling beauty, completed his attire. Von Straken was thunderstruck at the bravely-dressed stranger, and it was not until he had got right into the room that the old merchant saw it was Vander decken, and Whilelmina, too, saw that it was no other than the mysterious sailor who was proposed to her as a husband. Vanderdecken took off his hat, and bowed very low to the young lady, and executed a melancholy smile. in all the world, and who love you\u2014 for Wurtem will love you for my sake\u2014 are happy, likewise.\" As she spoke, Whilelmina flung her self into the arms of her father, and very nearly sent him backwards, chair and all. Now, this was very clever of Whilel mina, indeed, and under other circum stances than the serious ones that at pre sent surrounded the old merchant, might have taken him by storm, and carried the day ; but he was too firmly possessed with the idea of the certain ruin that would come upon him if he refused to carry out, as far as iu him lay, the ex peciations of Vanderdecken to hesitate ; and after a great struggle with his feel ings and with his daughter, he cried out \u2014 \" No\u2014 no\u2014 no !\" \"What do you say no for, father? Oh, but why do I ask ? You mean that you will never sacrifice the heart of your Whilelmina, or control her wishes in the little matter of choosing a husband.\" \" I don't mean anything of the sort.

WHILELMINA IS THE VICTIM OE A BIT OF ROCK CORAL. Certainly, the appearance of Vander decken was such, that if no one could admire the pale, melancholy face that he had, no one could possibly help admiring the beauty of his apnarel, and the glitter of his diamonds. Even Whilelmina was staggered, and looked at him in amaze ment. \"May I hope,\" he said, in the calm, quiet tone that he so usually spoke in, '\u2022 that I am welcome here ?\" \" Father, I will not have him.\" Tap \u2014 tap, came a sound at the door of the room at that moment, and the old merchant looked at Whilelmina as he said, hurriedly \u2014 \" Yes, Mynheer,\" faltered Von Stra ken. \"And here, too,\" said Vanderdecken, as he approached close to Whilelmina. \"Am I here welcome? Let me hope so.\" \" I daresay that is Slipperhauss, my head clerk, come to show me the books.

He was dressed in a suit of the most elegant pale purple velvet, and it was trimmed with the finest silver lace, and studded with such a multitude As he spoke these words he walked completely round her, and she felt that he touched her dress, but it was so very imperceptible, the touch, that she could not say anything about it, and, in fact, she did not feel inclined to be offended, for somehow, the grand dress the stranger wore had greatly affected her, and she looked at him with eyes of favour. \" Sweet Whilelmina,\" he said. \" Will you strive to think of me as one who loves you ?\" \" Yes,\" she said, faintly. \"Meine Got!\" cried Von Straken. \"How true it is that some men can turn the mind of a female so soon '.\""], [99, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 89 \" Do not let me hear anything,\" said Vanderdecken, \"at all derogatory to the charming sex, and especially in the presence of one of its most charming of all charming perfections, I beg of you.\" \" Oh, Mynheer,\" said Whilelmina. \" What diamonds you have '.\" \" Trifles,\" said vanderdecken, as he pulled from his hat the four diamonds that were upon it, and which seemed to VANDERDECKEN WILL COMPEL THE MERCHANT TO KEEP HIS BOND. hold the feather into it, but which did not do so. \" Mere trifles !

It is but the wavy echo of my words hanging in the air.\" \"That is all,\" said Von Straken ; but he said it in so strange a tone, that at any other time when her fancy was not so thoroughly under the control of the mysterious being that she was with, she would have laughed. \"And so these diamonds are for me V* she said. \"Oh, meine child,\" added Von Stra ken, \"you don't know how happy you make me.\" \"Happy,\" said Whilelmina, as she still looked at the diamonds, and she said it in a musing tone of voice \u2014 \u00ab Happy.\" \" And why should not you, my gentle love,\" said Vanderdecken, \" be happy. Surely one like you, so full of beauty, was formed for happiness. You admire those diamonds. 1 can sill your hands with them in a shining heap of gorgeous beauty.\" \" Oh, oh !\" cried Von Straken. Whilelmina looked confused. \" Yes, all for you, and many, many more.\" Whilelmina, with an air of abstraction, put the gems into her pocket, and th\u00ab, with a look of surprise, she drew forth a small gold ring, in which was set a pieoe of red coral. . \" If I thought\u2014\" she said. \"If you thought what?\" \" That it would be a right and a holy thiDg to think of you at all \u2014 if I could bring myself to think that you were not a being of another world \u2014 oh, if I could only think that all my superstitious fear whispers to me was but a delusion.\" Von Straken'groaned. \"Yes,\" added Whilelmina, as sne looked with evident admiration upon the sumptuous-looking Vanderdecken, \"if I could only bring myself to think that I should perhaps not \" She paused. \" Not refuse to make me blessed with this hana,\" ,?dded Vanderdecken, as he took it into his-own. \" Why, what i3 this ?* she said. \" How came I by this ?\" Vanderdecken smiled. \" I wished,\" he said, \" to make you a little present of it, but I thought you might refuse me, so I dropped it into yourpocket.

Ah ! how well it fits that finger upon which you place it. And now may I call the fair and gentle Whilelmina mine ?\" She looked confused, and yet her lips shaped themselves to the word, ' Yes.' It seemed, to her, by the scared look that she then put on, as if she had uttered the word from some impulse that she could not restrain. \" How cold,\" said Whilelmina, as she hastily withdrew her hand from that of the mysterious man. \"Bow very cold !\" Vanderdecken sighed very deeply. \" Oh, say that you will be mine,\" he said ; \" and then, when we are united, \"Mine! mine!\" cried Vanderdecken. \"Meine Got! yes!\" said Von Stra ken. \" Let me have the wedding over"], [101, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 91 5 as soon as possible\u2014 to-morrow.

Mynheer Von Straken was astounded. This ready acquiescence of Whilelmina in a step that he had thought prayers and threats would be alike inefficacious in the endeavour to force her to, was to him one of the most wonderful of all wonderful things ; but since it secured to him not only the advantages he at first possessed, but a son-in-law who made no greater store by diamonds than as if they had been pebble stones, it was not for him to say anything that was at all calculated to interfere with such a very desirable state of things. \" Take her,\" he said. \" Meine dear friend, take her. It is true that meine sweet child, Whilelmina, is the apple of my eye, as well as the core of my heart ; but I give her to you, meine friend, with all the pleasure in the world, and I have no doubt but you will be a very happy pair, indeed \u2014 very happy. Oh !\" The hall kind of groan with which Von Straken concluded this speech was quite sufficient to let any one see that it was as insincere as it could possibly be, and that he knew he was sacrificing his innocent child for gold ; but it so hap pened that just then there was no one present who chose to see as much. Vanderdecken, no doubt, saw it, but it did no suit him to notice it ; and Whilel mina was in too great a mist of the ima gination to hear what her father mum bled out at all. \"Indeed!\" said Vanderdecken, turn ing upon him. \" Hilloa !

Why, all the house says he is Vanderdecken, the Flying Dutchman \u2014 a fellow that gets into a great box, aud then disappears through the bottom of it ! Are you out of your senses, Mynheer Von Straken \u2014 and you, Miss Straken, are you going to take such a deadly-lively customer for a hus band ?\" \" To-day, then, fair one,\" said Van derdecken, \"let it be; and now I have but one request to make to you.\" \" A request ! Oh, what is it ?\" \"A very simple one, and one in which you may easily oblige me. It is that you will keep that ring upon your finger, and upon no account whatever, even for a half moment, remove it from there.\" \" Oh, I can easily promise that.\" \" You do promise it upon your soul ?\" Whilelmina looked a little frightened at this oath, and the solemn manner in which it was proposed to her ; but after the pause of a few seconds, she said \u2014 \" I promise, and upon my soul.\" \" That is enough,\" said Vander- \" Yes,\" said Whilelmina. \" I\u2014 that is \u2014 Oh, yes.\" \" Yes\u2014 yes. Oh, yes !\" added Von Straken. Vanderdecken strode up to Simpson and Co., and in a deep, hollow voice, he said \u2014"], [102, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 92 \"Certainly, if Mr. Simpson has no ob jection ; and if he has, I have only one proposal to make to him.\" \"And what may that be, sir?\" \u25a0 That as we both love the lady, and es we cannot both have her, that we jump, hand in hand, into the sea off the highest point we can find above it, and that we each try to drown the other, and the survivor'shall wed Whilelmina with out any hinderance then.\" \"Oh, thank you, I \" \" Or suppose we are both put into a dark room with two knives each of us, and left for an hour. The survivor then can marry the lady with a clear con science.\" \" Can he ! Well, all I can tell yon is, that you may marry the lady, and eat her afterwards, for all I care, rather than I would run any such risks for her. Good day to you, Mynheer Von Stra ken. I shall stay in Amsterdam a little longer, because I have some goods to purchase ; but I shall write home to my father, that, although I am here, and was, in a manner of speaking, properly ac cepted, and due at sight, you and' your daughter would not take me up, but allowed me to be dishonoured, and that I protested accordingly. Good-by, sir, and good-by to you, Miss Pat \u2014 yes, fat. I don't, as a general thing, object to a fat girl \u2014 they are very nice, to my mind ; but 1 do object to being made a fool of, Miss Fat. Bah! Good-by, Flying Dutchman. I believe you are tbe devil, that is what I believe, and you and Whilelmina will have imps in stead of children, with little green tails.\" With this anathema upon them all, Tom Simpson and Co. bounded out of the house, and it was not without a pang that Von Straken saw vanish all hope of a union between the great houses of Simpson and Co. and of Von Straken ; but what could he do ? Nothing. \" Let the wedding,\" said Vander decken, \" be two hours after dark this evening. Where shall it take place ?\" \" At the church of St. Eustache,\" said Von Straken, \" where I was married to her mother.\" CHAPTER XXVII. THE WEDDING OF WHILELMINA IB RATHER INTERRUPTED. \" A boat \u2014 a boat !\" Such was the cry of a tall, mysterious looking figure at one of the principal quays of Amsterdam soon after the inter view that Vanderdecken had bad with Mvnheer Von Straken and his daughter. \"\" A boat, quickly !\" Some of the phlegmatic Dutch water men waddled to the spot, and one of them, who was attired in about twelve pairs of nether garments, tsok his pipe from his mouth, and uttered the expres sion, but not very euphonious \u2014 \" Yah !\" With the, stem of his pipe, the man pointed to the boat which called him owner, and th& impetuous stranger jumped into it at once. \"Where to, Mynheer?\" said the waterman, as he took his place, and after duly spitting in each of his hands, laid hold of the oars. \" Where to, Myn heer ?\" \" To sea.\" \" Yah !\" The waterman did not care exactly where his visitor chose to go, nor who be was, so long as he paid well for the job ; and that be would do that, one might judge from the exceeding rich ness of his apparel, and manner in which he spcke, which was just that of a man who had plenty of money in his pockets. We need only say that the dress of the stranger was of rich velvet, trimmed with lace, and that his cap had in it a brilliant crimson leather. After that our reader will have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it was no other than Vanderdecken himself who called for a boat at one of the quays of Amster dam. This boat was none of your dancing wherries that are only fit for a duck-poud, or the very smoothest river water. No, this one was a good sea-going boat, and thoroughly Dutch in its make and shape, nearly as broad as it was long ; and when we say that no less than two Dutch men could sit upon the stern seat with out being very much crowded, it may be concluded that the boat was of tolerable \" I will be there,\" said Vanderdecken, \" and I will come here one hour before for the bride.\" dimensions."], [103, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 93 4 The stranger, or Vanderdecken, as we , breaking that silence, and was only con now may mention to the reader, with sidering how best to do so with a con wkom we are quite confidential, sat, of ference suitable to what he had to sav. course, facing the waterman, so that the latter, as light puffs of wind occasionally blew aside the folds of the huge cloak he wore, could see how richly his form was attired, and the idea took possession of him that it must be some person of very great consequence, indeed, that he had now in his boat. Hark ! What is that ? A strange whistling noise is in the air. It is the first indication of a coming gale of wind \u2014 the light outskirts, as it were, of the blast. The waterman heard it, and he rested a moment on his oars. \" Mynheer ?\" he said. The stranger gravely nodded his head. They had got a considerable distance from the quay, new, and were making their way fast towards the sea. The daylight, tos, was fading in the west, and long, ruddy streaks of crimson light pro claimed that the sun had set, and that it was only in reflected beams that the glorious luminary now lent a little light to the rapidly darkening earth. These long crimson streaks of light were rapidly going, and as the boat pur sued its course nearly due west, it looked as though it were chasing the daylight, with the vain hope of keeping within its influence. \" Mvnheer, did you hear that ?\" \"I did.\" \" Well, Mynheer, do you know what it means ? But why do I ask such a great gentleman, who cannot be expected to have exposed himself lo the dangers and the disagreeables of the ocean r so I will tell you, Mynheer, what it means. It means, then, that there will be a gale of wind off the coast to-night, and that the Zuyder Zee will roll hither aud thither, as though it were mad, aud that it will seethe up like a boiling cauldron, while the wind will roar and shout and scream over the surface of the sea, and the darkness will be great, and many a good ship will part from her cable, and many a gallant soul that has seen the sun set, and thought it beautiful, will never see it rise again.\" Towards the east, how black and dis mal everything looked ! Large piles of dismal clouds, steep and jagged in their outlines, and more resembling rocks piled one above the other than clouds rose up in giant majesty, giving threa tening forewarning of a rough night that was to come. The boatman began to look rather un easy, and more than once Vanderdeckrn looked steadly at the heavens. The water was getting more and more disturbed ea\u00abh moment ; and now and then, as though some strange commo tion were going on below the surface of the deep, there would come up to the surface, without any visible cause for such a phenomena, long streaks of white foam, which would dance over the little hillocks of waves, while the wind, al though it blew but fitfully, aud then only in faint gusts, kept up a low murmuring tone, Ike the drone of some strange wind instrument a long way off. Still the mysterious fare of the Dutch boatman did not speak, and the latter was rather awed by the rich dress and the haughty look of his customer, and appeared to dread taking so great a liberty as to begin a conversatiou. He did not know, though, that the stranger was himself upon the point of This was a tremendous long speech for the waterman to mats, but it was done in the enthusiasm of the moment, for, strange as it may sound, even a Dutchman may be enthusiastic at times, and be quite eloquent. Vanderdecken heard him to an end, regarding him, the while, with the cold stony look that was peculiar to him ; and then in a low soft voice that startled tbe waterman as he heard it, he said\u2014 \" Are you afraid of the storm i\" \"Afraid?\" \" Yes ; are you afraid of the winds and of the waves ?\" \" Afraid is a strong word, Mynheer. There's many a thing that a man don't choose to do or to like, and yet that he is not afraid of.\" \" You seem a bold fellow.\" \" 1 have fought in the flag ship of the great Admiral Von Ruttterbank, and I ought to be brave.\" \" I can see that you are so. I, too, have had my share of fighting, although"], [104, "94 VANDERDECKEN ; OR, his pocket a curious, old, faded piece of money, that, by that dim light, looksd like a piece of mouldy copper, and handed it to' the man. \"Keep that,\" he said, \"and your boat will float ; if the waves should con spire with the winds to toss it to de struction, you will not sink. Cease your efforts to bale the water out \u2014 it will come in again. Only have constancy of pur pose and trust to that coin, and you are safe.\" Sailors are all superstitious, and the man took the old coin with a look of infinite awe, and tried to examine it by the strange lurid light that was reflected off the water. \" Heed not what it is,\" said Vander decken. \" Let it suffice that it will save you while I am gone.\" now I am engaged in more peaceful pur suits. Pull further out.\" \"But, Mynheer \" \" Well ?\" \" The wind and the rising sea \u2014 Look at the white-topped waves \u2014 look what a trough there is at times in the sea. Only listen to the wind, how it has begun to howl now, instead of whist ling.\" \"Never mind.\" \"Nevermind! But \u2014 but the boat, Mynheer! The boat will not \u2014 cannot iive in a storm. We shall fill with the flrst ugly sea that strikes us, and then down we go.\" \" Oh, dear, no. You are very much mistaken ; 1 will take care of that. The object of my coining here was \" . \"For the pleasure and the health of a little trip on the wa'er, I fancy, Mynheer, so now let us get back.\" \" No, you are wronj. It is true, that along with other objects I do get the pleasure of a trip upon the water ; but the real fact is, that I came to bathe.\" \" While you are gone, Mynheer?\" \" Yes. I intend now to have what most of all amuses me, namely, a swim and a dive in the sea, when it is rather rough. You will wait for me, resting upon your oars as best you may, and keeping as near this spot as you can. _ I will return soon. Be heedful of the coin, for I tell you that without it, such is the present aspect of the winds and the waves, that your longing eyes would nsjver look upon the quay at Amsterdam again.\" The man shook a little. \" Alas !\" he said, \"I feared as much. Why did I come out upon such a night as this, when 1 saw by the omens and the portents of the weather that it would be foul, in deed ?\" \"To bathe?\" \"Exactly so. Is there anything so extraordinary in that ?\" \" What, Mynheer ! Bathe in a sea that has already a swell enough to make a frigate uncomfortable? Bathe in the dark, and with this wind howling about our ears? Here we have it !\" A tremendous wash of the sea at this moment came into the boat, and Van.1.-.-. deck and the waterman were up to th_;ir knees in the salt, water. \"There,\" added the man, \"I expected that.\" \"You are not lost, if you are but true to yourself. I tell you, man, that the coin you have will protect you, but if you are not true to me, it will lose its power ; so, once more take my orders, and wait for me about this spot. I shall return soon.\" \" Then you are not disappointed,\" said Vanderdecken. \"Hark 5 , I will pay you well for the service I require of \"ou.\" The waterman shook his head. \" Ah, Mynheer,\" he said, \" what good will money do me, if I am at the bottom of the Zuyder Zee ? I might go down with my pockets full of gold, and go down only all the easier for that, but I don't know what good the bright pieces would do me at the bottom of the sea. They might amuse the fishes, but not me.\" \"Oh, Mynheer, you will perish if you attempt, to leave the boat in such a sea as this ! Nothing human could buffet such waves as these. They will make a sport of you, and toss you about, as though you were the cork of a bottle of schnops I pray you do not leave the boat. Bather let us both do what we can, now, to make the shore again, and then bless all the Saints, and St. Nicholas especially, that we have escaped death.\" The waterman uttered these words \"You fancy that you run the risk of a loss of your boat and of your life ; but neither shall happen. Take this.\" As he spoke, Vanderdecken took from"], [105, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 95 with the greatest anxiety, but Vander decken paid not the slightest attention to them. Suddenly casting off the am ple cloak that was wrapped around him, he flang it towards the man. \" That will keep the wind 'from get ting to your heart and marrow,\" he said. \" And now, do not suppose that I have come here to seek death by what you see me do, for, as sure as the sun will shine again to-morrow, I will return to you ; and if you leave this spot, perdition catch your soul !\" With these .words, Vanderdecken closed his hands over his head, and with one plunge he went over the side of the boat, and cleaving the waves like a shot, he disappeared from before the aston ished and bewildered eyes of the water man. But his time had not yet come, and there was for him no such hope ! Down, down he went through the surging waters, and after getting some four or five fathoms below the surface, all was calm aud still as some fair lake upon a summer's day. It was only upon the surface of the water, after all, that tbe wild storm had power to do its worst, and so, on, on went Vanderdecken, until, far down below the raging of the wind and the waves, he stood upon the golden sand at the bottom of the Zuyder Zee. There was an old anchor, half embedded in the sand, where he alighted, and he placed his hand upon it for a moment or two, as he spoke\u2014 \" Why\u2014 oh, why do I not upon such a night as this,'' he groaned out in a voice of great anguish \u2014 \" why do I not meet the common lot, and die? \u2014 why do not those waves that are so madly tossing many an ill-fated bark above, come down to me and stop the current of my blood ? Why is it that my only way to an eman cipation from these terrors is by ruin ing the happiness of another ? Whilel mina, I must wed you, with all your beauty, if I can so far delude your judgment as to make you to the last be my bride ; and then, and then only, I am saved, along with the poor beings who still are in my phantom ship. Ob, horror \u2014 horror \u2014 horror ! How many years have we all sighed for death, and sighed for it in vain !\" Vanderdecken appeared to be quite overcome by the horrors of his situation for awhile, but then he covered his face with both his hands, and by some strange impulse that he gave himself, he floated through the water until he came to a kind of hollow chasm, into which, with a hissing sound, the water seemed to be pouring. Headlong Vanderdecken plunged into that hollow. In three minutes he rose to the sur face of the sea again, but it was upon the coast of Africa, near to the straits of Mozambigue, that he was now, , aud the moon was shining sweetly upon the waters, while the high headland, which forms the eastwr-1 \u00bbart of the vast con tinent of Africa, \u25a0; up tall and bleak looking into the sfoft night air. There was scarce a ripple upon the surface of the sea. The tide was wash in; in upon the shores of the Cape and \" Help ! help ! Oh, mercy !\" cried the man. \" He is gone ! he is lost ! I am alone now with the gale about me ! Help ! oh, help !\" A sea bird that had ridden upon the storm from its home in the far-off ocean, screamed around the head of the waterman, and the boat began to ship great waves, that rapidly filled it. \" I am lost \u2014 lost !\" he shouted. \" Heaven have mercy upon me, and be good to my wife and to my children ! All is lost, now !\" He had shipped the oars, and now he stood up as well as he could in the boat, and clasped his hands in prayer. The wind howled fiercely, and the waves rose to twenty, thirty, and forty feet in height, and dashed over the boat, but it was still buoyant, and at times it heeled over, and forced out nearly all the water that it had taken in, and righted itself again. CHAPTER XXVIII. VANDERDECKEN MAKES A PROMISE TO THE PHANTOM SEIP. We must leave the bewildered Dutch boatman while we follow the wild and wayward course of Vanderdecken. No mortal man could have lived for a moment in the sea into which he had so madly plunged ; and oh ! what a joy it would have been to that man of many griefs if the wild waves had suddenly found the power to hurry him to death !"], [106, "VANDERDECKEN. 96 stood, and the sea was more hushed even than it had been before. He accepted these omens as indications of the fact that Heaven heard him, and was not dis pleased at his words and his patience. But now Vanderdecken set about what he had sought that spot to do, and wav ing his arms over the sea, he sung, or rather chanted, the following words :\u2014 \u2022 \" From the sand and the rock, Where thy old timbers lie, Corns up, my brave ship, To the light of the sky ; From the sea-weed \u00bbnd shell, the Islaud of Madagascar ; and that gentle rush over the sands, and the shin- gles, and the shells, of the waves of the Southern Ocean, made a strange murmur- ing noise that might be heard many a mile out at sea. Vanderdecken rose right up, and stood upon the water. It was a strange thing to see that man there standing, with his pale face turned up to the moonlight, and his rich apparel not damped even bf the world of waters he had gone through to reach that spot, glistening in the soft beams of the queen of night. He spoke very sadly. \" Once again,\" he said, \" I am upon this coast, and in this sea which has been the scene of all the horrors that beset my existence. Oh, if but such a night as this had been about me and my fated ship, I had never sworn the dread- ful oath that has consigned me and so many others to such an age of misery. Then we should have passed the Cape, and said our prayers, like good and Christian men, and reached our port at Amsterdam, and our wives and our little ones would have smiled upon us a happy welcome ; but for many days and nights I was rudely buffetted by the storm, and my eyes were red, and ached with watching \u2014 our water-casks were empty, and we raved for drink \u2014 our food was scant ; and in the wild impo tence of that hour I did make that terrible oath which has been my destruc tion. Oh, Heaven have mercy upon me !\" Frem the wave-monsters' homes, Come up, my brave ship. From the dead, and the> bones. The soft moon is shininj The air it is light, Oh, come, thee, oh, come, Mid the stillness of night. Spread the sail \u2014 spread the sail, Let the swift tackle fall, Shipmates, oh, shipmates, To thee I now call.\" \" Vanderdecken !\u2014 Vanderdecken !\u2014 Vanderdecken !\" he shouted at the top of his voice, and the echo of the sound went over the surface of the sea, in endless reverberations. All was still, now, as the grave, save now and then that the sound of that name upon the night air caught the con cavity of some little cave, and the soft echo repeated it to the night air. The moon was shining out in all its splen dour, from a sky of blue ; and so trans parent did the water appear to be, that it seemed as though it could be seen right through, like a mere plate of crystal, and that the wonders of the deep might have been studied upon that night easily by the curious eye of science. But suddenly, about a cable's length from Vanderdecken, there began to be a strange commotion upon the surface of the sea. It seemed to be bubbling and boiling up from tbe bottom in huge masses, and parting and rolling over in all directions, as if for some common entrance, and presently the topmast of a ship appeared, with a long silken streamer pendent from it. Higher\u2014 higher still came that mast, and then the shrouds began to be visible, and the mizen and fore-masts came into sight, with all their tackling. Every inch of canvas was spread, and in the course of a few mo ments, with a lurch that sent some tons A cloud swept \"over the face of the moon, suddenly, as if a hand bad been placed across its disc. \" That is an answer,\" said Vander sfecksn. \" My doom continues.\" The cloud disappeared again. \" Be it so,\" he added. \"Be it so ; I raust endure, and blaspheme not. Oh, busy devil, do not tempt me to say one word, or to think one word that is inimi cal to the greatness and the justness of the Great God. Even now, there is a fiend by me, on the surface of the sea, whispering to me that I shall gain more by defiance than by prayers. But I will not heed him. Oh, Heaven, you see\u2014 you hear that I do not heed him !\" The moonbeams fell more sweetly wound the spot where Vanderdecken"], [107, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 97 of water from her decks, a large ship completely rose up, and sat upon the still waters. The flag of Holland fluttered gently at the stern, and a private merchant sig nal was at the gaff. The deck on the starboard side was crowded with men, gazing over the bulwarks, for she rose with her bowsprits to the west. There was a strange blue and shiny look about the ship as the moon shone upon it, and long snaky fish crawled out WHILELMINA SHOWS HER INDIFFERENCE TO TOM SIMPSON DURING BREAKFAST. monstrous fish that had arms like an ape and which made a strange blowing noise like a whale, sprang from the deck and disappeared into the sea again.

There was now a strange kind of bus tle upon the deck of the phantom ship with its ghastly crew. The sailors moved about noiselessly, gliding rather than walking, and presently a boat was low ered into the sea, and four men glided into it. The oars dipped into the spark ling ripples made by the moonbeams, and iu [the course of two or three minutes the boat was alongside of Vanderdecken. \" Hold !\" cried Vanderdecken. The crew raised a yell of rage and despair. \"Home\u2014 home '.\"they cried. \"Port Our homes \u2014 our wives \u2014 our children, call for us ! To port ! Home\u2014 home 1\" \" Hold !\" cried Vanderdecken again. \"I will give you words of comfort. Listen to me, all of you.\" They crouched round him. \" Ob, men of many sorrows\u2014 men of unfathomable griefs ! I come to tell ye that the fiat has gone forth, that unless I can get some young and inno cent heart to love me, and to wish, for my own sake, knowing who and what I am, to save me from eternal wrath, we may not get to our port.\" A scream of dissatisfied rage burst from the crew. Withouta word, Vanderdecken stepped into the boat, and then the phantom crew silently rowed him to the vessel. They all ascended the side, but not as mortal men would do by climbing, for, in some strange way, they seemed to float through the air on board, and Vander decken did the same, and in the course of another minute he stood upon the main deck of the phantom ship. The vessel was of old-fashioned build, and had a kind of quarter-deck of its own, about twenty feet square, rising some three feet from the ordinary main deck, and it was upon that, and close to the wheel, that he, Vanderdecken, the captain of that phantom ship and crew, stood. \" Hear me out ! In Amsterdam \u2014 \" \"Amsterdam \u2014 Amsterdam! Home \u2014 home !\" yelled the phantom crew. \" Why did lie mention Amsterdam ?\" \"He will tell you,\" added Vander decken. \"In Amsterdam there is a young maiden, named Whilelmina Straken\u2014 she has consented to be mine within an hour from this time. If she still, after knowing all my sad story, which I shall be obliged to tell her, takes me for her husband, I will be here at the hour of midnight, and then we will sail to our old port, by the stone quay at Amsterdam. Oh, my poor comrades, I have yet, yon see, a hope for you and for myself.\" \" A hope \u2014 a hope !\" said one of the crew, and then many of them turned aside, and held their hands to their faces as though they were weeping, but, alas ! the! ount of tears was long since dry with them. They could not weep. Tears would have been too great a luxury for them. If they could have wept, surely they woulrt have died soon. \" I come,\" said Vanderdecken, \" to tell you that there was such a hope, and now again I leave you. A boat is wait ing for me in the Zuyder Zee, without which, you know, I could not touch the shore. It is a boat that has been blessed and converted to the use of Christian men. Farewell !\" \" Helm a-lee !\" he cried. The order was obeyed. Vanderdecken took his place at the wheel, and with his eyes steadily fixed upon the south-west he tried to steer. The sp\"ctre crew looked on with white faces and curious metallic-looking eyes. The prow of the ship rose and fell, but never an inch did she make progress through the water. A light breeze now came from the north-east. It spread out the ensign and the flag, and it filled the sails. The water rinpled past the ship, and Vander decken kept his bead to the wind, but not an inch did she move. The prow rose and fell ; but, as if she had been sus pended between Heaven and earth, there she was, perfectly stationary as before. Vanderdecken dropped his hold of the wheel, and the whole crew, with one voice, uttered a wailing shriek. Vander decken placed his hands over his ears, and dropped to his knees with a wild cry of despair, and a death-like stillness reigned in the phantom ship. After a few minutes, then, Vander- cken looked about him. The crew By the gestures of the phantom crew, it was evident they thought the hopa"], [109, "THE FLYING- DUTCHMAN. 99 but a faint one ; nevertheless, they no longer yelled at Vanderdecken, but took him to the spot where they had picked him up, and with one plunge he went down in the sea. thunder, had spread itself across the hea vens, and made every object visible for one startling moment. \"Boat! boat!\" cried a voice. \"Boat!\" \" Holy St. Nicholas protect me !\" said the waterman, \" that is the dreadful mau!

WiTHhis hair on end \u2014 with terror depicted upon his countenance, and clutching to the sides of the boat, and shivering in the blast of the fierce wind, the waterman waited for the mysterious being who had hired him and his boat from the quay at Amsterdam. Vanderdecken was not gone alto gether above a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes at the utmost, but what an age that time had appeared to the terror-stricken waterman ! How over and over again he had given himself up for lost, and thought that the very best thing he could possibly do would be to throw himself overboard, and so put ar* end to his life and miseries together. But he did not do so. There is a something even in the faintest and most trifling hold of life that induces a greater clinging to it even than when one's hours are nice and lucky, and every thing is going well with us ; and so the boatman waited, and shook and shi vered, and the blood ran cold about his breast, but yet he waited. The storm that blew so fiercely off the coast of Holland was, as we have seen, purely local, and at the Cape of Good Hope there was calm and serene weather, so that the sea in which Vanderdecken now rose was of a very different descrip tion, indeed, to that into which he had sunk after leaving his phantom ship and his phantom crew. The night had set in with double darkness. There was no flash of co loured glory in the western sky now; and the line of the horizon that separates the surface of the water from the clouds was lost in one confused mass of vapour, as black as ink. Now and then only about the boat there played a strange phosphorescent, sparkle of light upon the water ; and twice or thrice a vivid flash of lightning, but unaccompanied by any The boat gave a sudden lurch to one side, and Vanderdecken, as he clutched it, said \u2014 \" Help me in, friend, and tell me I am welcome.\" \" You are welcome ! Come along ! Anything is welcome ! Anybody is wel come who will help me to get to the old wooden quay at Amsterdam ! Come on \u2014 there you are ! Oh, Mynheer, if a poor man may ask a question, I should like to know whether it is the devil, or anybody more amiable, who helps you to do such things ?\" \" Ask no questions,\" said Vander decken. \" Y'ou are safest in knowing little.\" \" Well, but \" \"Peace, I say ! And now let me warn you, babbler that you are ! If one word or one hint escapes your lips of what has passed to-night between us, the next time you put off from the shore will be your last, for a watery grave, and perdi tion afterwards will be your lot. !\" The waterman looked terrified at this declaration, as well he might ; and in a trembling voice he promised secrecy as to all that should occur or that had oc- curred. \" That is well,\" said Vanderdecken. \" The storm is \"hreatening. Let us go to port, now. Give me one of the oars.\""], [110, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 100 lurid glare over the boat and its occu pants; and although the wind howled and screamed sufficient to blow out the very stars from the firmament, this little light burnt as perpendicularly and clearly as though there was not a breath of air to discompose it. The waterman was terrified. He wished he had not asked for a light at all. He began to think that if his boat should go into the quay of Amsterdam with such a light burning at her bow, he should be the wonder and the alarm of the whole city. \" What !\" said the boatman, \" can such a great Mynheer as you take an oar in your hand ?\" \" Ay, and use it, too.\" The boatman shook his head, and evi dently had not the least confidence in the power of the other to use the oar ; but he let him take it, and, as well as the darkness would permit, he kept his eye upon him. What was his astonish ment to see him bend to the oar as though he had been used to it all his life, aud take such deep sweeps, that if the boatman had not done his best, the boat would have been spun quite round. \" You pull well. Mynheer,\" he said. \" I ought,\" said Vanderdecken. \" I have had some practice.\" \" Yah ! I did not think there was any man who could pull against me in such a way. Will you pull a lighter stroke, Mynheer, for 1 am rather cold, and not at my best strength.\" \" As you please.\" \" Ah, that is better ; and now, if I only had a light, I should feel quite satisfied and happy, for the boat don't ship water now as it did, considering we have her head better with the tide.\" \"Oh, Mynheer,\" he said, \"I admit that I asked for the light, but I would wish, indeed, now that it should go again. Its colour, you see, and \u2014 and\u2014 its steadiness, despite the wind \" \" Let it be,\" said Vanderdecken ; \" it will go out as we enter the quay. Let it be for the present.\" The boatman did not say anything more in the way of objection to the light ; but ever and anen he kept, as he worked at his single oar, casting glances at it, and in the strange halo that it cast around it, he more than once fancied that he saw hideous forms, with eyes that seemed to be like burning coals, and mouths distorted by the most horrible laughter, and yet no sound came upon his ears. The state of terror that he was in in creased each moment. He shook so that he could no longer pull at the oar, but made strange random strokes, now and then getting its blade so deep in the water that no human strength could have pulled it, and then catching the surface so lightly, that he would fall over upon his back, sprawling in the bottom of the boat. \"You may have a light, if you like,\" said Vanderdecken. \" I can give you one; but, recollect, that none of the wonders that you see are to be repeated to mortal ears. You know the conse quences if you do.\" \" Ob, yes \u2014 yes. Bat about this light, Mynheer \u2014 can you, indeed, give me one ? If you can, the sight of it will be cheer ing amid this darkness. Ah, Mynheer, you were jesting. There is no such thing as a light to be got in such a night as this. The wind that blows with such a racket about our ears, would soon enough put it, out, I reckon.\" \" No. Not the light that I can give you. Where will you have it ?\" \"I should like it in the head of the boat, as it will then show me what I am about, without distressing my eyes.\" \" Very well. There it is.\" As Vanderdecken spoke, he stepped forward to the head of the boar, and gave a slight puff of breath upon one part of the wood-work, where there was the top portion of a roughly carved ornament, and in a moment up flew from it a bright blue flame of about six inches in height, which cast a strange, \" Is that the way you pull an oar ?\" said Vanderdecken. \" No\u2014 no ! But\u2014 the\u2014 the light !\" \" Well, what of the light ?\" \" It is so \u2014 so very blue.\" \" Oh, it is the colour of it you object to, do you ? Well, we will change that, my friend. That shall not be an objec tion.\" Vanderdecken blew out the light again, and in one instant it changed to one of the most brilliant and dazzling crimsons that could be imagined. It was at once beautiful and fearful to look upon."], [111, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN 101 \" Holy St. Nicholas !\" said the boat man, \" was there ever such a light ?\" At the instant that he so spoke, out it went, and the darkness seemed to be double in intensity to what it had been before. say that Hans ever refused to fetch j schnops when any one else gave him the I money so to do.\" I( The boatman leant against an iron post that was firmly stuck in the edge of the quay, and used for the purpose of winding ropes round when vessels had to be warped out ; and then he thought over the singular adventure of the night t and with a very uncomfortable feeling, indeed, there came over him the recol lection of his promise to tell no one. \" Now that I am safe,\" he whispered to himself, \" and that it is all over, I feel that that is the worst of it, for of all the odd stories that ever I heard, there is no one that comes near to it. I should certainly have the best story in all Amsterdam to tell, and many is the glass of schnops that I should get in consequence. But, now, alas ! what can I do, for I can tell no one ?\" By the time the boatman had got to j an end of these reflections, Hans, the watchman, came back with the schnops, and holding up his lantern after he had given the bottle to the boatman, he said \u2014 \" It is gone !\" he said. \"Yes,\" said Vanderdecken, \"no doubt St. Nicholas blew it out. It would have been better not to have mentioned the name of the Saint just now ; but per haps you will do better without it, for I can see the quay at Amsterdam.\" \"Ah,\" cried the boatman, joyfully, \" and so can I ! That is, indeed, a most welcome sight to me ; and as you say, Mynheer, I can do better without the light than with it ; so, now, let us pull away.\" The prospect of being home so soon, notwithstanding all the violence of the winds and the waves, was now so de lightful to the boatman, that he worked right manfully, and in the course of another quarter of an hour the boat was in comparative still water near the quay. \"That is all right !\" cried the man. \"Oh, I could laugh outright for joy, now, that I could, for I never expected to set my foot upon the shore again ! Hilloa! Hans\u2014 Hans!\" \"Here, friend Snoggenhausen \u2014 here is your change, and here is your other money.\" \" Change, and other money ? What do you mean ?\" \"Why, just that you must have been ' out of your senses when you gave me so much gold to get a bottle of schnops with ; and Mynheer Tunklerheld, at the lustenrust, would not have given the change, only that he is a man of learn ing, and knows the value of the coins. 't He says that the coins are old ones of \\ the Stadtholderthat was in Holland more ' than a hundred years ago. He gave the change, though, and here is the silver.\" \" Yah !\" said the sleepy voice of the watchman of the quay. \u2022 \" Catch the hawser, Hans. All's right ! That's the way to do it ! And now, Mynheer, here we are safe at last.\" Vanderdecken stepped on to the quay, and the delighted boatman followed him. Turning, then, abruptly to him, Vander- decken placed a handful of old mouldy coins in his band, and said \u2014 \"Remember your promise !\" \" I will, Mynheer. A promise is a promise with me, and it is never forgot- ten. I will say nothing.\" \"For your soul's sake, keep to that !\" \" I will \u2014 I will ! And what is more, I \u2014 Oh, he is gone !

My blood is cold !\" \" The silver ?\" \" And, here are the other gold pieces. They are all gold, but only a little rusty, j and Mynheer Tunklerheld thinks they have been in the sea.\" 11 The boatman staggered back till he came to a coil of rope that was upon the Ij quay, and that upset him, and he sat i\\ down in the midst of it. j \" What did you say about the [ money V he gasped. i \" Why, that it was all gold.\" \"And what else?\" \" Yah, Mynheer, I will.

When Vanderdecken left the quay, to which he had been conveyed in the boat by the man whom he had so terri fied, aud then so magnificently paid for his services, he went directly towards the house of Mynheer Von Straken. \"Oh, the deuce!\" cried Tom Simp- son. \" I'll go and do something desper- ate ! I'll drown myself \u2014 I'll shoot my- self \u2014 I'll get drunk ! I will give away a gilder to the first poor person I meet !\" With these desperate words \u2014 the lat- ter, iu particular, showed a recklessness of purpose one would hardly have expected from a London tradesman \u2014 Tom Simp- son made a rush from the house, and with such precipitation did he proceed, that he fell right into the arms of Van- derdecken, who was pausing upon the threshold of the door to hear the dispute. \"Murder!\" cried Tom Simpson. \" What mean you, sir ?\" said Vander- decken, in his cold way. \" Oh, lor ! Oh \u2014 why \u2014 how sine you are ! Good gracious I a dreadful thought strikes me ! ' Oh\u2014 oh !\" The hour had certainly not yet arrived at wTiich the bridal party was to go to the church of St. Nicholas, but it was not far off now, and if Whilelmina in- tended to keep her promise, it was necessary that she should be getting ready to leave her father's house. When Vanderdecken got to the mer- chant's door he heard noises within of rather a stormy character, and he paused to listen. As he did so, he heard Von Straken speak. \" My dear Von Simpson and Co.,\" he said, \" I tell you it is all settled another way. Meine child.Whilelmina, has made up her mind not to have you. The union between the great houses of Simpson and Straken will not take place ; and it is quite clear, Mynheer Von Simpson and Co., that you will never be fat.\" \"But I shall get fat,\" cried Tom Simpson. \" Meine dear sir, you are small.\" \" Small\u2014 small ? Oh, dear, but I shall get big, I assure you I shall, Mynheer Von Straken ! I shall get big ! No man can ever get on in the City of London unless he is big ! I tell you, Mynheer, that there are but two qualifications that insure success in London, and those are, size and unscrulpulousness. Do you think I ain't going to get on and do what's right \u2014 that is, make money ?\" \" Mynheer Simpson and Co., my daughter, Whilelmina, will not have you, so go away.\" \" Go away ?\" \"Yes. Go back to your highly res- j pectable father, in the street of Newgate, i and tell him that I am very sorry that I \" Arc you mad ?\" \" No \u2014 no, not yet ! But wait a bit. I soon shall be \u2014 only wait a little. I begin to see it now. Oh !\" \" Stand from the door-step. I have business in this house.\" \" Well, but only a word. Oh, dear me, tell me, will you, my good sir \u2014 I see you are rather fine in your apparel \u2014 are viu going to marry the fair and the fat Whilelmina?\" \"Fool!\" \" Fool ? Well, that's about the coolest thing in the world, I think. Call me a fool, and my father is better off than everybody in the whole of Newgate Street ! Fool, indeed !\" Without any further hesitation, Van derdecken laid violent hands upon his rival, and twisted him round and shot him into the road with an energy that sent him right across it and against the houses on the opposite side of the street."], [113, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 103 But it was not so much the blow that Tom Simpson got against the house opposite, or the brush that he got against a post that was in his way, that aston ished him, as it was the wretchedly cold feel that came over him after he had been touched by Vanderdecken. It seemed to him as though the cold north had sent specially a lump of ice to rest upon his breast, and that there it was ra diating cold in all directions, and freezing his very blood. \" Oh, lor !\" he cried. \" Oh\u2014 oh, how cold I am, to be sure ! I want, now, to get a little warmth into me. Why, it must be a sharp frost, surely.\" Tom Simpson and Co. set off running as hard as he could, but he had not gone far, when, as he turned a corner, he came bump up against a gentleman in a cloak, whom he upset by the force of the con cussion. I ran away, that I knocked him down or. purpose ?\" Tom was right enough there. If he had only waited and apologised for the mishap, which, after all, was but one of the commonest of all common accidents that are likely to happen in the streets, all would have been well, and the gen tleman in the cloak would have been pacified, for he was not by any sort of means an unsociable man. When we inform our readers that this gentleman in the cloak is no other than our old friend Wurtem Carlis, they will readily come to the conclusion that he was not a likely person to fly into a rage about nothing at all ; but when one is knocked down in the streets, and the persou committing the outrage makes off, one is rather apt to feel indignant and to follow him. This was exactly the case at point. Whipping his cloak around the upper part of his person, so as not to impede him in his race through the streets of the city, Wurtem Carlis went after Tom Simpson without knowing that it was his rival at Von Straken's, but just considering that it was some impudent fellow in the streets who deserved a thrashing for his violence, which thrashing the young and active Wurtem was very well calculated to give him at once. Now, Tom Simpson, although he had been for some time in the good city of Amsterdam, was by no means well acquainted w'th its intricacies, and com pared with Wurtem Carlis' s, his know ledge was as nought ; so that it seemed highly probably it would be a short race, and that Tom Simpson would soon be run down. The principal thing he dreaded was that he should get into one of those narrow streets that, are to be met with in Amsterdam which terminate upon the bank of one of the canals, into which he must either go, or give up to his pur suer. All that Tom Simpson saw was some one struggling upon the ground in the folds of an ample cloak, and all he heard were some expressions of wrath in the Dutch language, and which were to him quite incomprehensible, except so far as there was no mistaking what they were by the tone. \" Confound it,\" he said, \" when this fellow gets up he will begin pummeling me, I'll be off.\" With this, Tom Simpson, instead of waiting, as it would have been but civil upon his part to do, to help the stranger to his feet again, set off at a hard run, with the hope of getting out of the way before tbe other should be able to rise and come after him. In this calculation, however, Tom Simpson was rather deceived, for the stranger was as young and much more active than he, Tom Simpson, was, and the only thing that detained him a mo ment or two was the cloak that had got rather awkwardly wrapped around his legs. The moment he got free from that great encumbrance, off he flew after Tom Simpson at a most amazing pace for a Dutchman. Luckily for Tom Simpson, however, he avoided such a danger ; but still he heard the rapid footsteps of the gentle man in the cloak behind him, and in his desperation, he was upon the point of knocking at some door and asking for shelter upon some pretence or another, when he turned a corner and found him self in front of a huge church. \" The deuce take him !\" said Tom Simpson, \"here he comes! I can hear him pelting after me like mad. That's always the way. If you get into one row, you are sure to get into another. Where shall I go to hide from this furious fellow, who will think, because"], [114, "VANDERDECKEN. 104 carried round to the guests as a sort of authority for the collection of such small coins as they might be supposed to give for the benefit of tbe officials of the church. It was the church of St. Nicholas. \"Ah!\" thought Tom Simpson, \"if I could only get in here, I should be all right, I daresay. By Jove, the door is open!\" When Tom Simpson treated himself to any very violent expletive, it was generally \"By Jove!\" \"Yes, the doer is open. This is capital. The very thing ! \u2014 The fellow will run en, no doubt, without thinking I have come in here ; and if he does come after me, he can't kick up a row in the church, surely ; so I shall be all right enough, and here goes.\" With these congratulatory words, Tom Simpson rushed up the steps of the church, and turned into the sacred edifice. Wurtem, through being born and bred in the old lazy city, at once knew that a wedding party was expected. Alas ! now little did he dream that it was his own much loved Whilelmina who was about to be the bride ! There was a pleasant and a holy calm about the interior of the old church, and, besides, Wurtem's father and mother lay interred in its vaults, so that he now stood upon the old stones that formed the flooring of its aisles with a feeling of awe aud melancholy. In the course of a few minutes he quite forgot the very existence of the manwho had thrownhim down at the corner of the street, and with slow and mechanical steps he paced about the church. A glance around him showed Tom that the church was dimly lighted up, as if for some approaching ceremony ; but still fearful that his euemy might come in, he ran along oneof the long and dreary-looking aisles\u2014 for the church of St. Nicholas at Amsterdam was very old indeed\u2014 and hid himself in a very obscure corner behind a tall column. Now, Tom Simpson was in the great est fright in the world all this while, for he made up his mind that all this walking about of the man in the cloak was to look for him. As his eyes got more and more each moment accustomed to the semi-darkness of the place, he could just see, by peeping out from his hiding-place, that it was his cloaked enemy, without being able to see that it was his old rival, Wurtem Carlis. \"He won't see me here,\" said Tom Simpson. Hardly had the fugitive so bestowed himself, than Wurtem Carlis, who had just turned the corner of the street in time to see him rush up the steps of the church, appeared upon its threshold. The sacred character of the building had the effect at once of stopping any thing like an ebullition of passion upon the part of Wurtem Carlis, and he very reverently removed his hat, which was a ceremony Tom Simpson had not, in his fright, gone through. \" He came in here,\" said Wurtem to himself, in a whisper. \" I am quite sure I saw him run up the steps and come in here.\" And, indeed, we may take upon our selves to say that very few people, in deed, would have known Wurtem now, considering that his great friend, Von Botter, the banker, had put him so much at his ease regarding money matters, and that be had ample time to provide himself with an elegant suit of clothes, and to alter his whole appearance in that wonderful way for the better, in which a man may alter his appearance who at once steps from poverty to affluence. \"Bother the fellow V' muttered Tom Simpson and Co. \" He wants, now, to take my life if he can, or he never would be so deucedly persevering in a church ' in looking after me as he now is. Why, he is poking about in every corner.\" \" This church,\" meditated Wurtem Carlis, \" is ever interesting to me, and I don't know that I can pass an hour more profitably than in reflection while be neath its roof. It is hare that those whom I loved so dearly, and who lowd j Wurtem looked around him, and then glancing towards the altar, he saw a faded-looking chaplet of flowers laid upon it. \" Oh, a wedding,\" he said. Now, in Amsterdam it was the cus tom for the verger of the church, an hour or so before a wedding was to take place, to lay a chaplet of Sowers upon the altar, which let every one know who came into the saored edifice upon what occasion it was going to be used ; and after the ceremony that chaplet was"], [115, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 105 me better than all the world, sleep the long sleep of death !\" Wurtem found a little seat in one corner, where the old verger was wont to sit upon high festivals of the church, and there he sat down, quite forgetful of the object that had brought him to that building. \" 1 have plenty of time, for I have not to visit, that mysterious Jan-Van Van- Jan yet for some hours, so 1 will pass one of them in the old church of St.Nicholas.\" WURTEM CARLIS'S INTRODUCT TO HIT.

We have been treating Vanderdecken, who is most unquestionably our hero, No. 14."], [116, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 106 he was nearly a fool, and I soon saw that he had no heart at all.\" sending Tom Simpson across the road, and cooling him down with his icy hands in the extraordinary manner that he had done, Vanderdecken entered the house. The sudden exit of Tom Simpson had left the outer door open, and so had fa cilitated the entrance of Vandei decken. He heard voices in the parlour, whicb was usually occupied by the merchant, and which had been the scene of the late uproar between Von Straken and his son-in-iaw that was to have been. \" No heart ?\" \"No, father. I have been reading, do you know, a fairy tale.\" The old merchant shook his head, in strong disapprobation of any such books. \" And,\" continued Whilelmina, \" one of the characters there had a heart that was made ot nothing but a few gold coins and some cheques for money, mixed up with so much selfishness that it was dreadful to think what he said and did, and I have been thinking father, that that is just the sort of heart that Tom Simpson and Co. has.\" \" Well\u2014 well, ho is gone.\" \" And a good things too.\" \" We will say no more about him ; but I do think he loved you.\" It would appear that, hearing some thing in the shape of a disturbance below, aud that high words were going on, Whilelmina had descended to know Vi hat it was all about, and it was her voice that Vanderdecken heard now, as he paused for a few minutes in the passage. \" Father,\" said Whilelmina, in a tone of melancholy, \" what was it that I heard in this room ? I thought you were at high words with some one.\" \"Not he, father. He never loved any one himself, and he never will.\" \" Well \u2014 well, drop him. And now, meine child, you know what is to take place soon. Let me ask you one ques tion.\" \" Yes, father.\" \" Are you happy ?\" Whilelmina placed her two hands upon her brow, and moved them down over her face in an odd, confused way, and then she said\u2014 \" Never you mind, meine beautiful child,\" said Von Straken, in a voice that seemed as though he were half crying, \" never you mind. Oh, dear\u2014 oh, dear !\" \" You are sad, father.\" \"I am.\" \" What is it that so much affects you ? Why, father, there are tears upon your cheeks. Oh, tell your own child, Whilelmina, what it is that causes you to weep ?\" 'Meine darling Whilelmina, you are my only child.\" \" Yes, father.\" \" I don't know.\" \" You don't know, meine child ?\" \" No, father, indeed I do not know, I feel so strange.\" Von Straken groaned. \"Yes,\" added Whilelmina, with a confused look, \"I feel \u2014 I don't know what I feel. Sometimes I shudder\"\u2014 she shuddered as she spoke \u2014 \" and then it seems to me at the moment impossible that I could marry that strange man ; but yet I seem as if I were compelled to do so by something, that I could not resist. I suppose I ought not to say that I am unhappy, since it is by my own free consent.\" \" And\u2014 I\u2014 that is\u2014 oh !\" \" You speak iu riddles, father. What is it that you would say to me ?\" \" My Whilelmina, I did hope that I should have seen you happy \u2014 the happy wife of an honest, well-to-do man ; but \u2014 but\u2014 oh, I do think that my heart will break !

That one was Vanderdecken, who heard it, and who was an attentive listener to all that Whilelmina said from his post in the passage. \"To whom?\" \" Well, I can't say ; but you know, my dear Whilelmina, that my heart was set upon an union between you and Tom Simpson and Co.\" \"Yes, father, but when the young man came here, you know, we found that"], [117, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN 107 \" I thought I heard something,\" said Whilelmina. \" A groan.\" hope ?\" said Vanderdecken, as he ap proached Whilelmina. \"Oh, yes \u2014 yes \u2014 our friends \u2014 are are \" \" It was me,\" said Von Straken. \u2022Ob, meine child, if you really now, at the last moment\u2014\u2014'' \" She means to say, Mnyheer Diderich, that our friends are to meet us at the Church of St. Nicholas.\" \"What, father?\" \" Nothing \u2014 I shall be the richest merchant in Holland \u2014 I shall have a fleet of merchantmen at sea, and the Stadt holder will smile when he sees me, and say \u2014 'Mynheer Von Straken, bow are you ?'

But I do not see that the bride is atcired for the occasion, [s it not usual that when a young and innocent girl goes to the altar, that she should, at all events, make some change in her apparel ?\" \" Oh, yes,\" said Whilelmina, with an abstracted look. \" I will soon do that. In good truth I had quite forgotten it.\" \"Take these orient pearls,\" said Van derdecken, as he produced from a pocket of his apparel a string of large pearls. \" They will do so bind up in your hair, or to wear round your neck.\" \" Meine Got !\" said Vou Straken, \" are they real ?\" \" Real as nature can make them, sir.\" \" Meine Got! then they are worth ten thousand gilders ! Let me look at them, meine child \u2014 let me look ! Oh ! what loves of pearls ! What beauties, to be sure ! How they smell of salt water and sea-weed.\" Vanderdecken tapped at the door of the room. At this sound both the old merchant and Whilelmina started. \"Who is it ?\" said Whilelmina. \" Who can it be ?\" said the merchant. Tap, went Vanderdecken at the door again. \" Do not be afraid, meine child. It is the \u2014 the \u2014 \" bridegroom, Von Stra ken was going to say, but like the \" Amen\" of Macbeth, the word, somehow or other, stuck in his throat. \" It is Diderich,\" said Whilelmina in a calm voice, that sounded more like that of a martyr who was condemned to tbe stake, than that of a young bride who was about to go to the altar with the man of her choice. \" Come iu, meine friend,\" said Von Straken, and then the door was slowly opened, and Vanderdecken, with a strange and sickly smile upon his face, entered the room. \" They went down in the wreck of an English ship that had come from the East-Indies, The pearls belonged to one of the native prince3 of India, and they were stolen from him by the agents of the East India Company ; but they never reached England, or they Mould \"You are welcome,\" said the mer chant. \" And welcome here, likewise, dare I"], [118, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 108 ther rolls out, and lies glittering amid tbe sea-weed.\" have been destined to go round the fat, greasy neck of the wife of the chairman of the Board of Directors there.\" \" The ship was lost ?\" said Whilel mina. \" I should like to see it.\" \" You would not, Von Straken.

And \u2014 and you will be so good the next time that you see it as to just lay hold of it and bring it here ?\" \" Meine child,\" said Von Straken, who had been fidgetting very much while this explanation was being given, \"meine child, do not ask questions. Let it suffice that you have the pearls, and that they will become you well.\" \" I thank Diderich for them,\" said Whilelmina. \"And now I will go and get myself ready to go to the church.\" \" You have the riDg upon your finger, I see,\" said Vanderdecken. \" Oh, yes, it is there ; and I should not like to part with it. It is a beauti ful ring, and I quite love it.\" Vanderdecken rose and held open the door that conducted to the staircase leading to the upper rooms of the house for Whilelmina to pass out by. Their eyes met, and the young girl gave a shudder as she left the room. Vander decken closed the door, and then came back to where Von Straken was sitting. \"You \u2014 you mean to perse? ere ?\" said the merchant. \" I will consider. Ah ! here comes the bride !\" At this moment Whilelmina appeared, dressed for the wedding, and attended by a young girl, who had come recently into the service of Von Straken and his daughter. The rich pearls that Vander decken had given her were on her neck, but they were scarcely whiter than the fair skin of Whilelmina. \" Ah !\" said Vanderdecken, \" you shame the pearls by your wondrous beauty ! But let us at once depart. The hour has surely come !\" Some clock close at hand struck, and Vanderdecken shook a little as he laid his hand upon that of the bride. She felt the cold from that touch shoot through her like an arrow of ice. \" Oh, how cold !\" \" Cold, meine child ?\" cried Von St,ra\u00ab ken. \"Take a drop of schnops.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes, do !\" said Vanderdecken. \" Oh, no \u2014 no ! I will take nothing. But I am very cold, indeed ! \u2014 oh, so cold ! But never mind. I shall be bit ter soon, no doubt. Oh, how very, very cold !\" \" In what ?\" \" In marrying my girl.\" \" Yes ; I have bestowed fortunes up on her, and I will give her diamonds to play with, if she likes. The sea is richer than the land.\" \"And\u2014 and\u2014 1 suppose you \u2014 that is\u2014 Eh ?\" ' \"Say on.\" \" 1 mean that you can get up what .you like that happens to be at the bot l torn of the sea.\" Von Straken felt rather alarmed, but let what would happen now, he felt that it was too late to retract, and the idea that he might prevail upon Vanderdecken to bring him that diamond coronal that he talked about, now and then came across his mind with such a pleasant feel ing, that he was ready to dare anything for the pleasure of possessing it.

The faded wreath upon the altar had iuformed Wurtem of the fact that a wedding was to take place, and so ho got out of the way ; and when he saw the old, tottering verger come and light some more of the candles upon and about the altar, and when he saw come into the church three ladies and three gentlemen, and begin a whispered con versation, he got still further into the gloom, for he did not wish to be ob served and brought forward as a witness of the ceremony, as it was frequently the custom to do to strangers. *\u25ba CHAPTER XXXII. SHOWS WHAT HAPPPENED AT THE WEDDING. It was just as the heavy old lumber- ing coach went from Von Straken's door to carry the wedding-party to tbe church 1 of St. Nicholas, that Tom Simpson had ! scrambled up the steps of that sacred edifice from the vengeance of the gentle- man in the cloak, whom he had acci- dentally knocked down. The reader will recollect how he then From bis secure retreat, too, Tom Simpson and Co. saw that something was going on, and by the dresses he, too, came to the conclusion that it was a wedding. hid in an obscure corner behind a pillar, and how Wurtem Carlis at first came into the church after him, full of the most violent intents, and how, by the very sacred character of the place, and the soft recollections that it brought to him of the dead, his auger all passed away, and he forgot the very presence of his foe, and gave himself up to a medi tative spirit, which is far from being a bad thing now and then to take posses sion of any man for a little time, amid the bustle and the tumult of every-day life. \" Oh, dear,\" he whispered to himself, \" I ought to have come here and married my Whilel nina, for I begin to find that I do like her, now. Alas\u2014 alas ! Oh, I sliall never be the man I used to was.\" With this melancholy speech, Tom Simpson, whose thoughts had got quite back to Whilelmina, in consequence of the sight of the wedding guests, sighed very deeply, and determined upon paying every attention to the proceedings. \"Of course, it's some young crea ture,\" he said, \" that is going to make somebody happy, aud here am I, Tom Simpson, who has been refused by Deputy Smotherali's daughter, in Bow Lane, Cheapside, now without the pros pect of a wife at all, since Miss Whilel mina won't have me.\" Tom could not think for a moment that this was actually the marriage of the fair Whilelmina t|*at was about to take place in the old church. It was too improbable, to his mind, that any such precipitate proceeding should take place, aud he was not yet quite without a hope in the deep recesses of his own little miuJ, that Von Straken would alter ids mind, and send for him again, and yet carry out the scheme of partnership be- Little did he, Wurtem Carlis, expect that by that time the fair object of his best affections, Whilelmina, had, under the influence of the spell cast over her faculties by Vanderdecken, consented to become the wife of that mysterious per son, and was actually upon her route to the very church in which he was indulg ing in melancholy musing. Nor did Tom Simpson and Co. dream of such a thing from the snug corner into which he had got to escape from the gentleman in the cloak, for his whole mind was too much engaged in consider ing his own personal safety to cast a thought upon Whilelmina. But thus we see how Providence or chance, it is difficult to say which, had"], [120, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 110 tween the great houses of Simpson and Straken. With some people, to hope is to ex pect, and it seems startlingly improba ble, to them, that anything else should ever come to pass ; and Tom, it would appear, was one of those people, for the merest possibility of Whilelmina beiug married off-haud at once did not at all occur to him. Tom Simpson was similarly affected' for at the same moment that Wurtem Carlis had made that discovery, he, too, had recognised in the portly form of the individual upon whose arm the bride was resting, the merchant. Von Straken, and he, too, came to the conclusion that the veiled lady was no other than the fair Whilelmina. Thus, then, we see how these two young men were destined, by a cruel and envious fate, to be spectators of the destruction of all their hopes ! But wait abit \u2014 we must not go so fast: something may happen yet. Who knows ? Now, one' thing was very curious in all this affair, and that was the mistake into which Tom Simpson and Co. and Wurtem Carlis naturally fell, as re- garded the person to whom Whilelmina was about to be married. Wurtem Carlis thought, to be sure, that it could be no other than Tom Simpson, a mar- riage with whom he considered the old merchant had hastily decided should take place, so as at once, and for ever, to put an end to all his, Wurtem's, hopes and wishes upon the subject. Tom Simpson, on the other hand, con- sidered that his rival, Wurtem Carlis, had triumphed, for he could not think for a moment that Von Straken would give his daughter's hand to the myste- rious sailor ; and so, in this natural mid- take, the two rivals, from their places of concealment, cursed each other heartily. The bridegroom was with the party, but he kept in the back ground very much, so that neither Wurtem nor Tom saw him for some few minutes after tho bridal party had entered the church, and, indeed, there was such a swinging about of petticoats, and a fluttering of white handkerchiefs, that it was no easy matter to see anything. The priest, however, was not disposed to stop in the cold church a moment longer than was necessary, so when he took his place at the altar it was neces- sary that, Vanderdecken should advance ; but he did so quickly, and alone, and going close up to the priest, he placed something in his hand that looked mar- vellously like a purse, as he said\u2014 \" I have something to say to the bride before the ceremony is gone on with, holy sir. Will you allow me five minutes ?\" And now the lights that tbe old verger had lit began to burn brightly, and to throw a tolerable radiance all around the altar, and for some few yards into the body of the church ; but all be yond the circumference of that circle of light the gloom was doubly solemn and impenetrable; so that both Tom Simp son and Wurtem Carlis were quite secure from observation. The guests talked together in whispers, for there is something about the atmos phere of a church that somehow prevents people speaking loud ; so that Wurtem Carlis nor Tom Simpson could not hear a word they said, or they might possibly have been a little enlightened as to the names of the parties about to be married. The night wind, too, which had by no means all gone down, kept up an odd kind of whistling and moaning noise in the old church, which tended to further coufuse the conversation of the wedding guests. But now the grinding sound of wheels came upon all ears, and the old verger made a frantic kind of rush to the door of the church, and stood to welcome the bride and the bridegroom. There was a subdued kind of bustle, and then the party entered the church. It took them a few minutes to get within the sphere of the influence of the lighis, and then, to the astonishment and horror. of Wurtem Carlis, he saw the portly form of the merchant, Von Straken. Leaning upon the merchant's arm was a female form, in white satin, and with a lace veil thrown over her head and face, but bis heart Hold him in a mo ment that it was his Whilelmina. The shock of this surprise was so great at the moment, that Wurtem Car lis was fixed as a statue, and could only glare at the proceedings without having the power to interfere with them in any way."], [121, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 111 \" Certainly, my son,\" said the priest ; \"and I can easily perceive that you are a very good and virtuous person, iudeed. Pray step into the little sacristy. The verger will show you the way. There is a bright fire of logs there, my son. It is a great pleasure to me to oblige in any way so polite and christian a per- sonage.\" As he spoke, the priest slipped the well- filled purse which Vanderdecken had handed to him into his pocket, and then looked as mild and as bland as if nothing had happened. Vanderdecken turned to Whilelmina, and in a low, gentle voice he spoke to her \u2014 \"Dearest love, there is something which I ought to tell you before you pronounce those irrevocable words that bind you to me ; and if you will only step into the little sacristy, I will tell you at once a little secret which you ought to kuow.\" The voice of Vand*. deoken faltered as he got to the end of these words, for he dreaded to think what might be the effect upon the mind of Whilelmina of letting her know who and what he was, which it will be remembered he was bound to do by the terms that had been given to him by the mysterious being in the caverns of the deep. Before Whilelmina could make any reply to him, Von Straken spoke, and he spoke, too, in quite a fidget of alarm, for fear any obstacle shauld arise to the prevention of a union that promised him such boundless wealth. \" Oh, never mind\u2014 never mind !\" he cried. \"Meine Got! you will have 1 plenty of time to tell her everything after the wedding !\" \" No,\" said Vanderdecken, \" what I have to say to her must be told before it.\" . \" I will listen to you,\" said Whilel- mina, shuddering. \" It is very cold here, iudeed ! Ob, so cold !\" '\u25a0 They say there is a blazing sire in the sacristy. Come !\" \"Yes,\" said the verger, into whose old shrivelled hand Vanderdecken slipped half a dozen gold pieces, \" there is a capital sire of Norway pine logs. I made it up myself. Step this way, Mynheer, f yo u please.\" \" Come !\" said Vanderdecken, as he just touched with his finger the white glove of Whilelmina. \" Come .\" She followed him, shuddering and shivering as she went. The old verger led the way, and a heavy door that opened into the sacristy in a few mo ments swung shut behind the ill-assorted pair, and the verger bolted back to the steps of the altar. \" Is this proper, holy sir?\" said Von Straken to the priest. \" Proper?\" said the priest, as he felt the well-filled purse in his pocket. \"To be sure it is\u2014 twenty, at least\u2014\" \" What do you say, holy sir ?\" \"Ob, I\u2014 I\u2014 that is nothing ! Have patience, Mynheer Von Straken ; and allow me to say that I think your son-in law is a most worthy gentleman.\" \"A wonderfully worthy gentleman,\" said the verger, jingling the gold pieces he had received lromVanderdeckcn. \"Well, but \" It is not of any consequence what Von Straken farther said to the priest, and what the priest said to him. Let us listen to what is going on in the sacristy. It was with that same feeling of fascina tion of volition, contrary to her will, that Whilelmina followed Vanderdecken into the sacristy. The bright sire for a mo ment warmed her hands and face, but, strange to say, it began rapidly to get dead and dull, and to show symptoms of going out. Vanderdecken paid no at tention to the phenomenon, however, but in a low, wailing voice, which sufficiently betrayed how much he dreaded the con fession he felt himself obliged to make, he spoke\u2014 \" Listen to me, fair Whilelmina Stra ken. Before you give me your hand, let there be no doubt upon your mind as to who and what I am. You know that I love you \u2014 you know that I am rich\u2014 I can surround you with all that wealth can produce ; and when I leave you, whicb, in the natural order of things, I shall do, there will be no one in ali the world so rich as you. Do you hear me?* \" Oh, yes\u2014 yes.\" \" Well, then, I will not let you marry me without knowing who and what I am. I \u2014 I\u2014 am\u2014 \" \"What?\" Vanderdecken covered his face With his hands, and shook as though he were"], [122, "VANDERDECKEN. 112 seized with some sudden convulsion, and then he looked so despairingly at the young girl that she was terrified. \" What can this be ?\" she said, \" that you have got to tell me ?\" Along with the shriek that Whilel- mina had uttered came a feeling of in- sensibility, and she fell to the floor of the sacristy. Vanderdecken immediately made a rush to the door of it, and placed himself against it so as to keep it shut \" Speak \u2014 speak, Whilelmina !\" he cried. \"From your own lips let me hear my condemnation. Let me hear in your own accents that you cannot and will not call yourself mine, I feel that such is the case ; yet I must hear it in plain words from you.\" Whilelmina was by far too much over- come with agitation to reply to him ; for although the feeling of faintness did not last sufficiently long to produce a complete prostration of strength, yet she was greatly shocked at this confir- mation of what she had considered to be only an idle legend. She still remained upon the floor, although she had risen te a kneeling posture ; and she held by the back of one of the old tall-backed Flem- ish chairs, that were in the sacristy. \" Speak to me,\" cried Vanderdecken again. \"Oh, speak !\" \" God !\" was all she could say. But the scream that had come from the lips of Whilelmina was sufficiently loud to penetrate the thick old oaken doors of the sacristy, aud it echoed with startling vehemence through the church. It fell like a thunder-clap upon the ears of old Von Stacken, and he was forced to stagger to a seat. It alarmed the priest so, that he made a grand rush up the steps of the altar, and dashing behind it, he crept right under, and there remained, trembling. It so astonished the old verger, that he dropped upon his knees, and, for the first time for many a long year, actually said his prayers. The wedding-guests slew hither and thither, in a very distracted and foolish manner; aud fat Mrs. Von Vander- kemptonhauseiiselt, a ship-chandler's wife, fell into the arms of the gay young Bulter Blog, and upset him in a moment, so that they both went spraw ling to the flooring of the old church. But if the scream from Whilelmina reached the ears of the wedding-guests, it likewise, naturally enough, reached those of her two lovers, who were, un- known to each other, and to everybody else, within the church. It had rather dilfereut effects, though, upon them. \"You shall know. You must know, Whilelmina, many years ago there was a man who offended Heaven, and he was doomed to suffer for so doing, until he could find some one who would love him, and who would, and who could say with perfect truth\u2014' Oh, God, forgive this man, for he is dear to me.' \" \" And \u2014 and, you are\u2014\u2014\" \" That man ! Yes, Whilelmina, I am that man !\" Whilelmina shuddered. \" You shall know all,\" he added. \"You shall not wed me in ignorance of who it is that you wed. It is my duty to you to tell you all.\" \" Is there more to tell ?\" \" Yes. As yet, you do not know who I .am. You don't know my right name ; but 1 will not deceive you.\" How glad Vanderdecken would have been if he dared have deceived her, and yet insured his one purpose ; but the condition upon which he was to emanci pate himself from the dreadful fate that hung over him, was that he should tell all before the marriage. \" What is the name,\" said Whi'el raina, \"that yon dread to tell me ?\" \"Oh, give me lime. Let me gather courage to hope that you will love me still. You shall have pearls and dia monds as no empress ever saw. I know where to place my hands upon them. You shall be rich \u2014 ay, licher than any Indian satrap's favourite.\" \" But who are you ?\" \" I am Vanderdecken, and they call me The Flying Dutchman !\" CHAPTER XXXIII. VON STRAKEN FINDS HIS CHANCE OP THE DIAMOND CORONAL FADE AWAY. Whilelmina uttered an ear-piercing shriek. That shriek was the death knell of the hopes of Vanderdecken, and the ex pression of absolulc despair that imme diately crossed his face was truly horri ble to look at."], [123, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN 113 Tom Simpson at once fell flat down, and began bellowing out for mercy, as he thought some serious riot was about to take place, during the course of which he might possibly sustain some serious injury. Upon Wurtem Carlis the effect was very different.

I cannot.\" \" You cannot what ?\" Whilelmina said something, but it was lost even to the fine senses of Vander decken in the terrible uproar that was now at the door of the sacristy, and which was so tremendous that it seemed to threaten the destruction ofthe church itself. The fact was, that after bruising him self from top to toe by making two more i mad dashes against the door, and find ing that it would not stir a hair's breadth, Wurtem Carlis looked around him for some weapon with which to burst it open. As the baffled lover looked so around him, his eyes glared like those of a j basilisk, and the expression of his coun- ' tenance was so terrifying, that the priest i who had just peeped from behind the J altar, upon catching sight of it, bobbed his head down again, crying \u2014 \" The Lord deliver us ? One glance around him was sufficient 1 to convince Wurtem Carlis that there I was no weapon within his grasp which could have the least effect upon the oaken-door of the sacristy, so, with a bound like that of a tiger securing his prey, he pounced upon the old verger, and grappled him by the throat. \"Murder I\" \"Villain!\" shouted Wurtem Carlis. ; \u2122 Give me something to force that door j, wiiih,-or you are a dead man.\" \u2022\"\u00a9brloh\u2014 ah !\" \u25a0\"Bto you hear me ?

Speak, wretch, and do not tempt me to do you a mischief.\" \" The Lord be good to us !'* \"None of your prayer mumbling here,\" added Wurtem, shaking the little old man until .here was hardly any breath left in him. \" Tell me at once where I may lay tny hands upon some thing with which I can break down the door of the sacristy ?\" \" Ab, I bave a large hatchet 1\" \" The very thing. Give it to me.

There, by the old tablet to tbe Carlis family ?\" , \"Ob, yes.\" \" That will do.\" With a rush that seemed about suffi- cient to have carried him by sheer force right through the stone wall of the church, if such would have answered his ' purpose, Wurtem Carlis went towards 1 the door cf the sacristy, and found it 1 open about half an inch. \" Whilelmina !\" he cried. Bang ! went the door shut again, nar- rowly escaping the nose of that gallant and impetuous young lover, \" Whilelmina '.\" he shouted again, and then be heard a bolt shot into its socket, | and dashing against USte door again, he found that it was as -fast as a lock. The fact was, that Vanderdecken had found the sudden attack upon the door stagger even him, and he seized the op- portunity, when Wurtem Carlis again rnshed from it, to slam it shut again, and shoot one of the huge %o_ts into the socket, so the door wtE quite fest ; and again, heedless of themad shouts of Wur- tem Carlis without, he spoke to the half- ' fainting Whilelmina. \"Speak to me!\" he said. \"Year' nothing.but speak to me freely. You now J know who and what I am. Tell me if in' your woman's nature you pity me ?\" \" Have mercy !\" said Whilelmina. \"There issno need to sue for mercy \u2014 I will not harm you. 1 have neither the rrer var the will to harm yon, girl. you caanot pity me eo far as to be mine, knowing now who and what I am, say so, and you are free; but oh !

CHAPTER XXXIV. Well \u2014 it was this brass candlestick that made the thundering appeal at the door of the sacristy, and prevented Van derdecken from hearing what reply Whilelmina made to him. Bang \u2014 bang\u2014 bang ! it went in such an awful and stunning manner, that one of two things must clearly happen soon ; either the door of the sacristy must give way, or the candlestick. It was the latter that happened to happen, for just as Wurtem Carlis summoned all his strength to give one terrific blow that would, he thought, be sufficient to knock the door bodily down, off flew the lower part of the candlestick, and left him nothing but the long shaft of it in his hands. FURTHER DREADFUL THINGS HAPPEN IN THE CHURCH OF ST. NICHOLAS. At this answer from the old verger, it was quite a wonder that Wurtem Carlis did not take his life, instead of giving him such a throw, that he went sliding along the well-polished floor at a great speed, and right into the corner where Tom Simpson had hidden himself so snugly. Now, the fact was that Tom Simpson had at that very moment gathered cou rage to get up and creep along for a few paces to try and find out what was going on and kicking up such a terrible racket, and the little verger came like a cannon ball against his legs and upset him in a moment. Tom Simpson made sure that this was some horrible supernatural attack upon him, and, with a groan, he lay quite slat where he was thrown down, sprawl ing across the verger's legs, and effec tually holding that half-dead individual down likewise. There was now a cessation of the tre mendous knocking at the door, and Van derdecken was able again to speak to Whilelmina. '\u25a0 Do not tremble,\" he said. \" Do not be alarmed ; but ask your heart again if you can be mine. \" \" No \u2014 no ! 1 cannot \u2014 I dare not! I have heard your story from many mouths, but I never quite believed that there was such a being as yourself.\" \" Alas ! it is too true.\" Wurtem was maddened at his failure to get some weapon from the verger, and he looked round him again with fury in his counte-nance, until a sudden and, what he considered, a Very lucky suggestion came to his aid. Upon each side of the altar there stood two immense candlesticks, about twelve feet of brass gilt, and the bases of them were amazingly strong and heavy, so as to give them solidity. With one of these Wurtem thought he might almost batter down the church. \"Ah, this will do,\" he shouted, as he rushed to the nearest candlestick, and knocking the candle out of it, he had it across his shoulder in a moment. \" Sacrilege '.\" cried the priest, just peeping ot the state of affairs from be hind the altar. *\u25a0 What ?\" said Wurtem. \" Sacrilege ! Those are holy candle sticks.\" \" Sacrilege be !\" We need not put down exactly what Wurtem Carlis concluded his little ex clamatory speech with, as we feel that it was far from being right, and that, hkewis i we may safely leave it to the imagination of the reader, who might, perhaps, under similar circumstances, \" I cannot be yours. I do pity yea. Heaven knows that 1 do ; but I cannot marry one who \u2014 who may be said to \u2014 to \" \" To what ?\" \"To belong to the grave t\" Whilelmina shuddered as she spoke, and Vanderdecken uttered a deep groan as he regarded her with fixed atteniion. \" You can pity me, Whilelmina, but not sufficiently to enable you to come to the altar and to plight your troth to me \u2014 not sufficiently to let me call you mine in the face of Heaven !\u25a0\" \" No, no ! I cannot do that ! I dare not \u2014 1 feel that I ought not ! Do not ask me ! Be content that you have my pity ; and I can only hope that we may never meet again.\" \" Be it so. My doom is spoken ; but, oh ! Whilelmina, if you think there is any chance of your relenting \u2014 if you think that in the course of time you could be to me what I ask vou \" \" No, no, no !\" \" Be it so.\""], [126, "VANDERDECKEN 116 \" Take your pearls back again. Take your diamonds. I feel that I dare not sacrifice myself to a being who is not of this world.\" here, some one. Help and lights ! I have saved her !\" One of the wedding guests, who was a little more courageous than the rest, now lifted a wax light out of one of the smaller candlesticks that were upon the altar, and made his way to the sacristy with it, and held it up, so that it cast a tolerable light around it. There was Wurtem Carlis, with the fair Whilelmina in his arms ; and there upon the floor was the candle that had been upset by the mysterious hand ; but the bridegroom that was to have been had disappeared, without leaving the least vestige of his person behind. \" Good gracious, what does it all mean ?\" said the wedding guest, \" and who are you, sir? You are not the bridegroom.\" \" Yes, I am,\" said Wurtem Carlis. \" Oh dear, no. He was taller than you, and paler, and uglier.\" \" Thank you. But never mind about him. Just light me the way into the church with this lovely young lady. Where is Mynheer Von Straken ?\" \" He is in the church.\" \" I am \u2014 I am, indeed, of this world, Whilelmina.\" \" And take your ring, too.\" \" Oh, no, no ! Not that ! You will then not even pity me. Let me implore you, for the sake of one who did love yon, to keep that ring upon your finger yet.\" \"Oh, yes, yes, take it! Take back everything that belongs to you. Indeed, I do not wish to keep it. I cannot get it off. Oh, how tight it is !\" \"As a last and only favour I beg of you to retain it. If you take it off I much fear that you will not even pity me. Keep it on ; and I make you welcome to all the jewels that I have given you.\" \"No.no! I \" Whatever Whilelmina was upon the point of saying, or whatever she actually did say, was completely lost in the racket that Wurtem Carlis now made at the door again, for he had possessed himself of another of the large brass candlesticks in defiance of the priest, who had again cried out against the sacrilegious charac ter of his doings ; and this time the door shook terribly, and one of the panels be gan in a very ominous manner to creak under the blows from the candlestick. ' The wedding-guest led the way, and Wurtem Carlis carried Whilelmina from the sacristy; and as we are quite confidential with the reader, and feel assured he will not let it go any further, we may say that he look the opportu nity of kissing her a great many times. No doubt he thought it might restore her to consciousness ; but, somehow, the more he kissed the more she fainted. \" Let me go !\" shouted Whilelmina. She did not mean to intimate that anybody was holding her, but the words reached the ears of Wurtem Carlis, and made him ten times more desperate than before, so that with one furious blow just over where the bolt was, be broke it and the candlestick at once, and the door swung open. CHAPTER. XXXV. WURTEM CARLIS MAKES A BOLD RE- QUEST TO VON STRAKEN. \" Whilelmina !\" he cried. \" My Whil elmina!\" The scene of confusion and riot that had taken place in the church had had the effect of completely mystifying poor old Von Straken. There he sat where he had first fallen, and he was quite in capable, for a time, of speaking a w or to any one. \" Wurtem\u2014 Wurtem 1\" she shrieked, and in another moment she was in his arms, and had really fainted this time. There had been a goodly thick wax candle burning upon the table in the sacristy, but the fire had gone out, and the grate in which it had been burning so recently was stone cold now. Wurtem just saw a human hand make a blow at the candle, and away it went, and all in the sacristy was pitchy dank. \" Lights 1\" he cried. \" Bring a light He had heard the scream that in the first instance had produced so much of, if not all, the riot ; and he had seen Wurtem Carlis, although, in his fine new cloths, he did not know him a bit, be labouring the door of the sacristv with"], [127, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 117 she holy candlestick. He had seen the door give way, and he had seen Wurtem Carlis come into the church with the fair Whilelmina cuddled up in his arms in a very loving kind of way, indeed ; but even that did not rouse him, for a faint idea had began to come over the merchant's rather dull brain to the effect that it was aR a dream, for he could not believe that any such torrent of circumstances could possibly happen in reality. respect to what the unhappy father was about lo say, and then he added\u2014 \" That is just what I want to know. Where is Mynheer Von Diderich, my illustrious son-in-law who was to have been ?\" \"You do not mean, Mynheer Von Straken,\" cried Wuitem Carlis, in a tone of ind ignation. \" You cannot mean to say that you would have wedded I your fair and accomplished child to that dreadful man ?\" \"Father\u2014 father,\" said Whilelmina, \" where are you f\" The merchant made no reply. \" Mynheer Von Straken,\" said Wur tem Carlis, \" I restore you your daugh ter ; and let me hope that it was not with your consent that she was to be sacri ficed to a fiend.\" \"Where am I?\" said Whilelmina, for it will be seen that she had quite miraculously recovered from her fainting fit upon getting into the church, where Wurtem Carlis had left off the kissing. Far be it from us to insinute that the kissing had anything in the world to do with the cessation of Whilelmina's state of insensibility ; and if any of our readers think it had, all we can say is, that we don't agree with them, and we have it from the most authentic sources that it had not. \" Who are you ?\" said Von Straken. \" Who am I? Can you, Mynheer, pretend not to know me ? Is it possible that your memory should be so short that you cau forget me ? Look at me again, I pray you, and see if yon cannot tell yourself that you know me well. I am Wurtem Carlis.\" \" Yah !\" \" Ah, I am sure that you kuow me, Mynheer \u2014 I am quite sure of it ; and your beautiful aud amiable daughter knows me likewise.\" \"Yes,\" said Whilelmina, \"I do. But\u2014 but \" \" But what, dear one ?\" \" Where is he ?\" The fair Whilelmina shuddered as she spoke, and looked around her in such a terrified manuer, that she quite filled all the guests with a new fright, and they shook again, as they began to cast furtive glances into the cold, dark corners of the old church. The priest now came out from his hiding-place behind [the altar, and the wedding-guests gathered round Wurtem Carlis, and several of them shook Mynheer Von Straken until he was aroused to something like a conscious ness of where be was, and of what was taking place about him. \" Meine Got !\" \" He must be still in the sacristy,\" said one. \" Yes \u2014 yes,\" said the others. \" He must be there. Let us find him \u2014 let us have him out.\" There was now quite a rush to the sacristy, but a glance around it was suffi cient to show them what Wurtem Carlis had fully ascertained before, namely, that Vanderdecken was not there ; and they returned with disappointment in their looks and fear at their hearts. When they heard him say that, they knew he was coming round a little ; but when he added \u2014 \" Has anybody seen my pipe anywhere ?\" they knew that he was all right. \"Oh father,\" said Whilelmina, as, after some kicking, she persuaded Wur tem Carlis to place her upon her feet. \" Oh, father, what a dreadful night this is ?\u2014 What a frightful wedding !\" \" Yah 1\" said Von Straken. \" There is no one there,\" said one of the guests. \"Meine Got,\" said Von Straken, \"I only wish \" \" What-what ?\" \" That I had my pipe here, for then I think that I should be able to come to some conclusion about this affair.\" \" But where is tbe bridegroom ?\" cried the six guesi sail at once. \"Where is Mynheer Diderich ?\" \" Hush !\" said Von Straken. \"Oh, my Whilelmina!\" said Wurtem Carlis. \" Is it possible that with your Everybody was mute, and listened with"], [128, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 118 own consent you came here to be sacri- ficed to that wretched-looking monster who I saw in the church with you ?\" ! Whilelmina hung down her head and \"Oh, she is beginning it all again,\" said old Von Straken. \" My dear young lady,\" said the priest, \" don't scream here. Remember that you are in a church \u2014 no less a church, too, then that named after the ancient, and intrepid, and holy St. Nicholas ; and to scream within these sacred walls is little \u2014 very little short of sacrilege.\" I wept. \" Is this,\" continued Wurtem Carlis, warming with his subject asyoung gen- tlemen are apt to do when they are in love. \" Is this your affection for me, which was to undergo no change ? Is !fhis the love that was to abide ever with you under all circumstances ?\" \"Oh, Wurtem\u2014 Wurtem!\" \"Oh, Whilelmina\u2014 Whilelmina !\" \" This is dreadful,\" said a lady, who was one of the party. \"The idea of us all ooming here, and shaving no.wedding after all, is one of the most fearful things I ever heard of\" \"Exactly so,\" said another. \"The difficulty is to get the men to the church ; but, after getting one so far, to have no wedding after all, is truly shocking.\" \" Oh, horrid ! horrid !\" said a third. \"But 1 cannot help it,\" said Whilel mina, as she looked imploringly at. Wur tem Carlis. \" I cannot help it ! I came here to be married, and \u2014 and \u2014 you. see, there is no bridegroom.\" \"No,\" said Wurtem, \"there is not; but yet, Whilelmina \" \" Yes, Wurtem ?\" \" The best thing you can do now, as your bridegroom that you came to church with has been so ungallant as to give you the slip at the last miuute is, to \u2014 to \u2014 \" \" Yes, dear Wurtem?\" * \"Go home again!\" At these cruel words from Wurtem Now, Whilelmina did not say, \"Sacri lege be !\" as Wurtem Carlis had done ; but we will not take upon our. selves to say that some such idea did not come uppermost in her mind at that highly aggravating moment. \" Will St. Nicholas provide a husband for this poor disappointed girl ?\" said one of the lady guests ; \" and you, Myn heer\" \u2014 here she darted an angry glance at Wurtem Carlis \u2014 \"do you call yourself a man ?\" \"I hope so,\" said Wurtem. \" Stop !\" said a voice. \" Stop 1\u2014 \u2022 Hilloa! Hold hard! Stop!\" CHAPTER XXXVI. WURTEM KEEPS HIS APPOINTMENT WITH JAN-VANi The sound of this voice coming from quite a remote corner of the church filled everybody with the most lively alarm. The priest was behind the altar again, and hid himself as he had done only so short a time previously. The wedding guests looked with terrified eyes in the direction of the tones, and Mynheer Von Straken uttered a great groan, and mut tered something about his pipe. The three ladies let go Whilelmina, who, finding herself quite unsupported, dropped to her knees, and looked the picture of beautiful grief, with a little dash of terror mixed up with it. \" Stop, [ say !'r cried the mysterious voice again. \"Hold hard, all of you! Here I am ! Don't you know me ?\" With these words, Tom Simpson and Co. made his appearance before the as tonished group. \" Rascal !\" cried Wurtem Carlis, \" I know you !\" \" Sir,\" said Tom Simpson, who did1 not recognise Wrurtem in the elegant suit of dotte* he bow wore,, \" sir,_I beg Carlis \u2014 words of such a very different import, too, to those she had expected from him \u2014 the fair and gentle Whilel- mina uttered another good scream, and fell into the arms of the three ladies. There can be no doubt in the world but that Whilelmina had fully antici- pated Wurtem Carlis would have pro- posed himself to fill up the hiatus which bad ensued upon tbe mysterious depar- ture of the bridegroom ;and we must say that it is a very hardcabe, indeed, for any young lady to come to a church to be married, having made np her mind to that awful step, and thrn to be coolly told to go home again without a husband at all. If anything in the world should make a youngs lady scream, that is the 'thing."], [129, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 119 to beg your pardoning pardon for upset- ting .your worship at the corner of a street.

Mynheer Von Straken, how do you do ? Whilelmina, I am your obe- dient. You know me. I am Tom Simp- son and Co. I forgive and I forget 1 everything that has passed ; and I am willing at this moment to marry you, and unite the houses of Simpson and Straken for ever I\" Wurtem Carlis, and it was quite evident that upon his fiat everything was to turn. Everybody looked at him, and there was a silence in the chureh now, so that, in a manner of speaking, he felt compelled to say something. Now, Wurtem Carlis, as the reader is well aware, had a proud and independent spirit, and the idea that Whilelmina, who had all but sworn to be his and no one's elses should, come to the church of St. Nicholas to be married to another, quite secretly almost, galled him greatly. If she had prayed to him to have her just then, be could not have said, \" Yes,\" not he, for bis blood was up, and there was an animated colour upon his cheeks ; and, in fact, Wurtem Carlis felt that he was ill used \u2014 and we quite agree with him that such was the fact. He was ill used, and we applaud his spirit. \"It is a thousand pities,\" he said \"when a young lady does a gentleman the honour of coming to chureh with him to be married that the ceremony should not be concluded ; and I can only rack my wits in this case at the mye-. serious disappear ance of t he bridegroom.' \" Oh, Wurtem !\" sobbed poor Whilel mina. \" Meine Got !\" said Van Straken. \" He is a fine jouth !\" \" That is noble f said one of the ladies. I \" Oh, quite !\" said another. \" Yes, yes, it's all right !\" ericd all the marriage guests in a breath, and then they all looked at Whilelmina, who in her terror looked at Wurtem Carlis, and began crying copiously. \" Good gracious ! that's sacrilege !\" cried the priest. \" Sacrilege be !\" said Tom Simp son ; \" that is to say, I mean that \u2014 that \u25a0 \u2014 1 \u2014 nothing !\" \"What a reprobate set are in the church !\" groaned the priest. \"The mo- ment T mention sacrilege lo any one of them, they come out with some awful remark. There is only one comfort, and that is, that they will all go to the Hem !\" The priest pointed downwards as he spoke, for he did not like to make mention at that hour of the evening of the old gentleman, who is never men- tioned at all to ears polite. \" I consider,\" added Tom Simpson, \"that I have done the polite thing in making the offer I have. Here 1 am, the representative of the House of Simpson -aBdCo., of Newgate Street, in the city of London \u2014 the friend of the Lord Mayor ; and I oan safely saj, that neither father nor I ever lent a sixpence or said a civil word in our lives to any one whom we did not expect to get something out of, or who was not so much better off than \" I say, I can only wonder at the mys terious disappearance of the bride groom,\" added Wurtem; \"but as he is gone, and as this young lady, of course, don' like to go home without a hus band \" \" Wurtem\u2014 Wurtem f \" Aud as she is evidently not at all particular as to who or what the hus band is, 1 beg to recommend her to my friei.d, Tom Simpson, here, who is \" \"Thank you \u2014 thank you!\" said Tom Simpson, rubbing his hands together. \" I'm much obliged for all favours.\" \" Who is about, as contemptible an animal upon two legs as I ever met with.\" \"The deuce!\" \" And so, if the young lady likes to marry him, and as I am here, at any rate, I don't mind doing a civil act, and I will give away the bride.\" \" Wretch !\" said Whilelmina. ourselves that we were afraid to do other wise.\" \" Monster !\" said the three ladies. \" Meine Got ! an excellent youth !\" said Von Straken ; \u2014 \"a most beautiful youth! Meine Got!\" Again the fair Whilelmina looked at Tom Simpson looked rather foolish, and old Von Straken muttered some thing about his pipe that nobody could exactly hear."], [130, "VANDERDECKEN. 120 now it is quite a pleasure to think that I am mistaken.\" \" And won't you have me ?\" whined Tom Simpson and Co. \"No, idiot!\" \"Oh, dear\u2014 oh, dear !\" Wurtem Carlis had shrunk back into the gloom of the darkness ; and then, with his hands clasped \u2014 for he still loved Whilelmina \u2014 he saw her led from the church by her father, \" As I have an appointment,\" added Wurtem Carlis, \"the hour for which is drawing near\" \u2014 with these words, he took a magnificent gold watch from his pocket, and glanced at it \u2014 \"the hour for which is drawing near. I should feel very much obliged if the fair lady, who is not particular, would make up her mind one way or the other quickly.\" Tom Simpson looked from one to the other, now, with rather a foolish look, and it was quite evident that he did not know very wel! whether to be pleased or angry. The wedding guests, too, all looked a little puzzled, and the priest began to think that, after all, there was a chance of a wedding really taking place, and of his getting another fee from the second bridegroom upon the interesting occasion, as well as retaining the well-filled purse that had been handed to him from the skat one. CHAPTER XXXVII. JAN-VAff TURNS OUT TO BE A SUS- PICIOUS CHARACTER. Poor Wurtem Carlis! Everything seemed to conspire now to make him wretched ! What to him was it that he was befriended by the mysterious Jan-Van? What to him was it that the great banker, Mynheer Vo n Straken, offered his coffers to him ? What to him was it that the little tantalising, provoking daughter of Von Straken all but offered herself to his arms? His Whilelmina was now lost to him for ever, and how could he be otherwise than wretched ? Whilelmina now soon put a stop to all speculations and surprises by sud denly starting to her feet and crying out with remarkable energy \u2014 \u25a0 \" I won't have anybody, father !\" \" Yah, meine child I\" \" Take me home. I won't have anybody. Only I cannot go without ex pressing my thanks to the gentleman who is so anxious to give me away'' The impulse came strongly over him to rush after her and call her back, and offer even then to wed her ; but he did succeed in controlling it, as lovers, and other folks, by-the-by, will commonly do, until it was too late to be of any effect ; and then forgettig Tom Simp son and Co., and, in fact, every one else, he madly rushed from the old church, shouting as he went \u2014 \" Whilelmina ! \u2014 Whilelmina ! I am still your own Wurtem Carlis \u2014 still your own true lover until death !\" Alas ! she was by that time half-way home, and poor Carlis only found the echo of the name of Whilelmina returned to him in mocking cadences at the corners of the streets. How desolate he felt ! Whilelmina italicised these words, so that they flew, as it were, right into the face of Wurtem Carlis, for whom she intended them ; but he took no manner of notice of this in the world. \"Father!\" added Whilelmina, and she spoke with such startling emphasis that the old merchant jumped again. \" Meine Got, yes, what is it ?\" \" Take me home, if you will do so, father. I have no inclination to stay here any longer and be insulted.\" \" Come, meine child \u2014 come, then,\" said Von Straken, in a doleful tone of voice. \" I call everybody to witness that I am a very unhappy man, and that I cannot help what has taken place to night. Come home, meine child. You know you are always welcome to your father's arms and his home.\" \"All is lost !\" he said\u2014 \"all is lost; and like the dim and airy fabric of some wild distempered dream visiting a sick man's brain, my love has flown from me, and I am desolate. Oh, Whilel mina \u2014 Whilelmina! did you not swear to be mine ? \u2014 Did you not teil me that nothing should induce you to give your- \"Yes, father,\" said Whilelmina, \" and I will never leave you now, for I love no one.

The voice is familiar. Yon are \" Wurtem was silent as the grave as he counted the strokes ; and when the lazy clock had finished striking, and the echo of the sounds with a strange buzz were still upon the night air, he said\u2014 \u25a0-> \"I had forgotten! By Heavens, 1 had forgotten 1 It is the hour when I am pledged to meet my benefactor, Jan- Van !\" \" Jan- Van Van-Jan.\" \"Yes, the same. I came to meet you.\" \"According to your promise.\" \" Which, you see, 1 have duly kept, Mynheer.\" \"Duly kept,\" said Jan-Van, in a cold tone of voice. \" Do you make a merit my young sir, of keeping a promise ?\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no. But I had some little difficulty in getting here, Mynheer and I am very anxious that you shouM not think me remiss in my duty to you.\" \" There could be no difficulty in get ting here,\" said Jan- Van, \"that your own passions and follies did not pro duce. But we will quit such a theme. You are here, and that is sufficient ; and now let me ask you, Mynheer Carlis, if you found the banker agreeable to your wishes ?\" This was rather an awkward re membrance for a man who had just, as it were, in the most romantic and pathetic manner imaginable, bidden Amsterdam a long farewell. Wurtem Carlis stood for a few moments irreso lute and undetermined what to do in the emergency. At length honour got the better of romance, as it was sure to do in such a constituted mind as his, and he said \u2014 \u25a0 '\u2022 No\u2014 no ! I cannot go until I find what it is that Jan- Van wants of me. I have accepted benefits at his hands\u2014 the very clothing I wear is a result of his bounty, and I feel that I ought to meet him. I will do so ; and after that I will leave Amsterdam for ever.\"- \" Quite so ; and his daughter was a little more than agreeable to my wishes.\" \" Indeed ?\" With this resolve, which was a very proper one under the circumstances, Wurtem Carlis set off at a very un- Dutchlike pace to keep his appointment by the side of the canal with his unknown and mysterious friend, Jan- Van. The distance was sufficient to con sume ksome ten minutes of time, not withstanding that the young man went at good speed, and when he reached the spot he was very much out of breath, , and he paused to look around him for Jan-Van, and to his great relief saw no one. \" Yes, Mynheer. The great banker, Von Rotter, wanted me for his son-in law ; and he asked me to ask you\u2014\u2014\" \" Well, why do you pause V \u25a0 Because I feel that I ought not to ask you favours even for myself, much less for such a man as Von Rotter.\" \" Never mind that. What was it that vou were to ask me ?\" \" For the contract about the dykes.* \"Humph! Is that all?\" \"It is all.\" \" Very well. Tell Von Rotter that Jan- Van and you will talk on that matter at another opportunity.\" \" I will, Mynheer. And now as I in tend, if it please Heaven to permit ine so to do, to quit Holland soon, I am anxious to know what service I can per form for you in requital of your great kindness to me ?\" \" Thank the fates,\" he said, \" al though late, I seem to be the first here. After all his great kindness to me I would not seem to be ungrateful of his wishes on any account, so I'm glad, as I say, that I am here first. Hilloa ' Stand off !\" Wurtem clapped his hand to his head as some one touched him on the shoulder, and then turning suddenly, he \"Young man,\" said Jan- Van, in a serious tone, \" you talk of performing services in requital for kindness."], [133, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 123 Know that kindness can only be repaid by kindness, and that continuity of friendship which shall know no lapse.\" \" Mynheer, I will do all I can in the world for you.\" \" Why, what an extraordinary youth you are !\" \" How so ?\" the present, till I get the leave of ano ther person to tell you. Were the secret my own I would freely trust you with it ; but as it is another's, I dare not do so. Be assured, though, that the time will come when you will know all.\" \" I am content, Mynheer.\" \" Come, then, and let us try our skill upon the lock of this door. Have you anything like a workmanlike ability in picking a lock ?\" \"I fear not.\" \" You quite forget that it is I who ought to do all I can in the world for you. Did you not commence the in terchange of good offices between us by saving my life ?\" \"It was a, great joy tn me that I was able to do so, Mynheer.\" \"That I can well believe, Wurtem Carlis. And now I will tell you what I want of you, which is, that you should save me from the consequences of such another misadventure as that which befell me upon our last in' erview.\" \" What, Mynheer 1 Do you expect that the villains will have the audacity to attack you again ?\" \" I do, indeed.\" \" Then they shall find me, I hope, well prepared to do battle with them. You have but to say, Mynheer, how I am to act so as to save you from the peril you speak of, and I am quite at your service.\" \" Come with me, then, Mynheer Wur tem, and you will soon know precisely what it is that I want of you.\" With these words, the mysterious Jan- Van led Wurtem downrather an obscure \" Then I have, and will try it myself.\" Jan-Van, upon this, took from his pocket rather a suspicious-looking machine of iron, and began to work at the key-hole of the door of the empty house with it. Wurtem Carlis was getting anything but delighted with his quaint acquaintance, for, to tell the truth, the operations of Jan-Van savoured very much of housebreaking ; and yet there was such a calm, gentlemanly manner about him, that it forbode the suppo sition that he was a thief ; and, besides, surely Von Rotter, the great banker, would not bow so low at the very pro nunciation of his name, if he were anything but some very great personage. Poor Carlis was, in truth, terribly puzzled to know what to make of this mysterious Jan- Van Van-Jan. \"Yes,\" said Jan -Van, after a few minutes, \" it yields. Ah ! we shall be succes fui.\" street, and then along another thorough fare, which brought them in front of a large dingy-looking house, that had all the appearance of being shut up. He paused before this house, and in a low tone he said to Carlis \u2014 \"We,\" thought Wurtem. \"You say we, but you are doing it all yourself, after all. Is the door open, Mynheer?\" \" Confound it, no, and yet the lock is picked. There is some fastening on the inside, and that makes me suspicious that there is some one in the house.\" \" Now, Mynheer Wurtem, we must manage in some way or another to get into this house.\" \"It certainly tends that way,\" said Wurtem. \" What is to be done __\"' \" It is empty, to all appearance.\" \" Yes, Mynheer, it is empty, as you say, but the house next to it is occup ed by certain people, with whom I have some sort of disagreement ; but still, I do not choose that they should know me as an open foe. What I wish is, to ac complish my designs as secretly as pos sible.\" \"Let me consider. Well! the best way is to persevere, if possible. There is another door by the side, here, that always before was bolted up well on the inside ; but who knows what state it may be in now ? It is just possible that some one may have been in the house aud fastened this door and then left by the other.\" \"And those designs, Mynheer Jan- Van, are- \" \"Such, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis, a3 I must keep secret even from you for \"Very possible, Mynheer. Let us go and try it, by all means.\" The smaller door which Jan-Van alluded to was evidently one that was"], [134, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 124 enemies for us to cope with, it would be as well that whichever of us first reaches this door, should know how to open it in a moment.\" \" Exactly, Mynheer. Then you rather expect that such a little contingency may take place in the course of the night ?\" \"There is no saying, my young friend. Everything is possible. And now thai we have got so far, I may as well tell you that my object is to find my way to the sleeping chamber of a young lady, who is the wife of a German dragoon, or his reputed wife.\" \"Indeed?\" used by the servants of the house, and it was not nearly so strong as that at which Jan- Van had been trying to pro cure admittance to the premises. When they looked closely at it, though, they found that it was secured by a padlock. \" Ab,\" said Jan- Van, \" this accounts for the other door being fast on the in side. Come, my good Wurtem, do not be at all uneasy now. We'll soon break this padlock, and then in we are to the hoase.\" The truth was, that the only thing the good Wurtem, as Jan- Van called him, was at all uneasy about, was concerning the character of the expedition that they were on at such an hour of the night. But he had made up his mind to go through with the affair, and there was no time for reflection. Jan-Van found a large stone in the roadway, and with one well-directed blow he demolished the padlock, and then the door was open. \" Yes. The fact is, I feel an interest in the young lady ; and the part of the affair that I want to entrust to yoa is to keep watch for fear the German dragoon should interrupt me, which would be anything but agreeable. You compre hend, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis ?\" \"Anything but agreeable, indeed. But do you consider. Mynheer Jan-Van, that this affair is quite moral ?\" \"Oh, that is quite another thing, my dear friend. All we have to do is to go through with it like heroes.\" \" That will do,\" he said. \"Yes, Mynheer,\" said Wurtem, \" that would do for us if the watch of the good City of Amsterdam was to happen to pass this way.\" \" The watch, my friend, did vou say?\" \" Yes, Mynheer.\" \" I rather suspect, then, that the watch find a more agreeable occu pation in drinking and dozing away their time at the Schnops Hausen, than in perambulating the city. But come in. We will not run the chance, since you think it is one, by remaining any longer in the open air. Come into the house.\" Upon the principle that he had laid down for himself to do just whatever Mynheer Jan-Van asked him upon that eventful .night, Wurtem entered the dark passage that was just within the little door of the house that had been forcibly opened. Jan- Van closed it, and after some time fumbling about, shot a bolt at the top of the door into its socket. CHAPTER XXXVIII. WURTEM CARLIS FINDS HIMSELF IN AH AWKWARD POSITION \"This Jan-Van,\" thought Wurtem Carlis, \" is quite clearly no better than he should be, if, indeed, he is one-half so good ; and the sooner I get out of his company the better ; but as I am committed to go through with this adventure, I will do so, let the con sequences of it be what they may.\" This was, perhaps, a more chivalrous than wise determination on the part of Wurtem Carlis ; but still he adhered to it, and followed Jan- Van down a long, narrow passage of the empty house. It was not till then that they had got a considerable distance from the little door at which they had entered, that Jan- Van ventured upon lighting a little match made of wax that he had with him, and which shed such a tiny light around it, that, althought it prevented them from running against the wall, or stumbling over the staircase, or coming \"You will recollect, Wurtem,\" he said, \" that the door is bolted at the top, if we should want to open it rather in a hurry.\" \" Yes, I will recollect.\" \" That is well ; for if we should ehance to be pursued by too many"], [135, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 125 into violent collision with any article of furniture in the house, it did nothing more ; and, for the life of him, Wurtem could not get a good view of Jan- Van's face, although, without being absolutely rude in his attempts, he tried his ut most to do so- bolts were speedily withdrawn by Jan- Van, and a rush of cold air when the trap-door was opened, sufficiently in dicated that it led direct to the roof of the house. \"Now,\" said Jan-Van, \"there will be no difficulty in our climbing through here from the table. Hold the light, my good Carlis.\" Wurtem did so, and with consider able agility Jan- Van clambered through the little square aperture in the ceiling, and on to the roof of the bouse. He then reached down his hand, and took the fight from Carlis ; but the moment he got it above the level of the ceiling of the room, a pnff of night wind blew it out. There was a long and crazy flight of stairs close at hand to where Jan- Van had paused to light the little wax taper, aud holding that tiny light above his head, he commenced the ascent, and Wurtem followed him. The stairs creaked in a most ominous manuer, as though they had a decided intention of coming downn ipon them ; but they did reach the landng at the top in safety. Jan-Van spoke agaiu. \"Now, Wurtem,\" he said, \"this house has no story above this one that we are upon now; but we must get upon the roof, through a small trap-door that we shall find in the ceiling of one of the rooms.\" \"As you please,\" said Wurtem. \" You are very kind to be so com plying; for, to tell the truth, I am afraid I am exacting too much from you ; but the confidence I have in your arm, and in your courage to use it, is so great, that I should hardly have visited here again without you.\" \" Then you have been here before ?\" \" Oh, yes. The next house to this, into which it is my object to penetrate, is tbe very one you saw me come out of, pursued by those rascals, who, but for your aid, would, iu good truth, have made short work of me.\" \"Never mind, Wurtem,* said Jan- Van. \" Come up. We can do without a light here, lor the moon is rising.\" -a Wurtem, when he got on the roof of the house, found that such was the fact. The night had altered very much indeed for the better, and the broad silver disc of the moon was just peeping op from the horizon, and beginning to shed a soft light over all objects in the ancient city. The night air, however, blew keenly, aud Wurtem could not but shiver from its influence as he stood upon the house-top. \" You are cold, my good friend, but you will soon be under cover again.\" \" How so, Mynheer ?\" \" Why, there is a similar trap-door to this which we have come through in the roof of the next house, and it is through that that I hope to get admittance to that residence.\" \" I was not aware that we were so close to that house now. This is a part of the city with which I am not very familiar.\" \"Very good,\" said Wurtem Carlis, but in his heart he meant \" very bad.\"j There was certainly one good thing, though, connected with the whole affair, and that was, that Jan-Van showed no sort of disposition to put Wurtem Carlis forward into any danger whde he avoided it himself. On the contrary, he went on across the roof of the house first, and was evidently inclined to take the initiative in the whole transaction. \" Oh, yes. This is only a roundabout route of getting to that same house ; so you know the sort of gentry with which you have to deal.\" \" They certainly did not look very scrupulous.\" Jan-Van now led the way into one of the rooms, where there seemed to be some rough accommodation for sleeping. A large deal table, too, was in the middle of the room, upon which he mounted ; and then he observed to Wurtem Carlis that there was a square door in the ceiling, secured on the inside by a couple of bolts. These The little trap-door in the roof of the next house was duly found, and from the rapidity with which Jan-Van opened it, Wurtem Carlis come to the conclusion that that was by means the first time he had made his way into that house in so illegitimate a manner, although he had"], [136, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 126 and I will, therefore, tell you exactly . what I wish you to do. I am about, as I before took occasion to hint to you, to seek the chamber of a young lady, who is either the wife or the mistress of a German dragoon. If I can persuade her to leave the house with me 1 will.

Speak low! But you may drop down here with perfect confi dence. It is a soft bed that is beneath the trap-door.\" Upon this assurance, Wurtem Carlis, with an amount of faith that did him great credit, shut his eyes, and let him self drop through the trap-door, and, sure enough, he was rewarded for his confi dence by alighting upon a very soft bed indeed ; but hardly had he done so, than Jan- Van said\u2014 \" Very good. Mynheer.\" \" You do not like the affair ?\" \" Mynheer Jan- Van, let it suffice that I hive given you my word that I would aid you in this affair, and that I will, con sequently, keep my promise to you. I am so little in the habit of falsifying my thoughts and feelings that I will freely confess to you that it is not exactly the sort of employment, I like, to keep watch on the stairs while youpay your addresses to another man's wife. The affair is not a dignified one, Mynheer Jan- Van \" \" Hush ! some one comes !\" \"The deuce they do !\" said Wurtem, and he shrunk down just as Jan-Van very adroitly drew a curtain that was at the foot of the bed, and so shaded them from (he immediate gaze of anyone who might be merely coming into the room upon some ordinary errand. The flash of a light the next moment came upon the walls and ceiling of the apartment, and a voice \u2014 it was a female's \u2014said \u2014 \u25a0 \"Quite the reverse,\" said Jan-Van, \"and I don't at all wonder at your re pugnance to it. I honour your virtue.\" \" I wish I could return the \" \" Are you here, Fauchette ?\" All was still, although Wurtem Carlis felt, he knew not why, strongly tempted to say, \" Yes ; here I am.\" \" Where can that girl be ?\" said the voice again, and then the light flashed away again, and all was still and dark as before. \" Why do you pause ? You were going to say you wished you could re turn the compliment, but you cannot. Was not that the idea ?\" \" Mynheer, it was.\" \" Well, then, I honour you for that sentiment likewise, so that, you see, after all, there is a very cordial agreement between us, indeed.\" \" Is this man amusing himself at my expense or not ?\" thought Wurtem Carlis. \"If I only thought that, I should feel rather indignant.\" \" Come \u2014 come,\" said Jan- Van, \" you are a good and honourable youth. To tell the truth, Wurtem, I am not paying, or about to pay my addresses to the German dragoon's little wife at all. More 1 cannot tell you ; but, believe me, my errand here is a just and honourable one, or I would not have engaged you in it.\" \" That is an escape, I suppose ?\" whis pered Wurtem to his friend. \" Rather,\" said Jan- Van, with all the coolness in the world. \" It would have been very awkward if we had been seen, inasmuch as it- would have very much deranged my plans. Now, come on.\" \" But Mynheer Jan- Van \" \" Well, what ?\" \" If you wish me to serve you well and effectually to-night, it is really necessary that you should say a little more to me concerning what you wish me to do, and be just a little more explicit than you have been. I assure you, Mynheer, that I do not make such a remark from any captious or disagreeable feeling, but just because I really wish to serve you.\" \" Of that I am convinced, my friend, \" Mynheer Jan- Van, I thank you for saying that.

But we waste precious moments. Let me beg of you to take up your post atonce.\" With these words, Jan-Vau took Carlis by the arm and led him from the room on to a long kind of corridor or landing at the top of the principal stair case of the house. not promised to aid him ? Am I not pledged to do so, and have I not all but agreed that, however circumstances may look black against him, I will believe that he is on the path of honour ? Oh, yes \u2014 yes. That is all true, and I must not interfere.\" Wurtem took two steps back again, and then he heard a loud sobbing from some one in the chamber, and his heart beat fast at the thought that, after all, he might be playing the guard to a villain. \" Oh, this is cruel \u2014 this is cruel !\" \" Here, my dear young friend, Wur tem,\" he said, \" I shall be obliged to you if you will take your stand. If the German dragoon should come home, bringing with him, as it is more than likely he will do, should he come at all, a lot of his drunken companions, you will give me notice by at once making your way to the room that you will see me enter.\" said Wurtem. \" Why does he thus treat me ? Why does he place me in such a situation as this without the means of knowing that be is honest ?\" Wurtem, in the anxiety of the mo ment, quite forgot that Jan- Van had given him a kind of reason for all that by telling him that the secret of his night's proceedings was another's ; but it was hardly to be expected that in the agitation of such a time the young man should be very mindful of eveiy little particular of the past. The sobbing continued without in terruption ; and now, mingled with it, Wurtem Carlis could hear the voice of Jan-Van, in a high tone of command, saying something that he (Wurtem Carlis) could not exactly catch the precise words of, but which he tried to listen to. \" I will.\" \" But you will understand, my good Wurtem, that the notice of the approach of the dragoon must be early, or we shall not have time to escape him.\" \"That I completely understand, and, therefore, I will keep a good watch for him. I will keep upon the stairs, so that there shall be no possible chance of my missing hearing him the moment he shall come home.\" \" Do so, Carlis, and you still further bind to you Jan-Van.\" With these words, the decidedly mys terious personage walked along the land ing, carrying the light that he had illu minated with him, and Wurtem saw him tap at a door. \" Come in,\" said a female voice. \"Is it you, Grogenhoff?\" \" Yes, my love,\" said Jan-Van. He was admitted to the room, and the next thing that Wurtem Carlis heard was the door slammed very violently shut, and then a loud shriek from some one in the room. \" Will it be dishonourable of me,\" he said, \" to step a little closer to the door and listen, or will it be justifiable ?\" We specially call upon the reader to remark, that Wurtem Carlis had the strictest sense of honour, and t hat nothing in the world would induce him to stoop to any action which he considered was inconsistent with that honour ; but now, after a few moments' thought, he reasoned in this way \u2014 \" I do not know this man, Jan- Van. Who shall say but that he may be one of the greatest villains that ever stepped, and that he may have come here to perpetrate some villany, the conse- quences of which it may be a part ofhis plan to throw entirely upon me ? Be sides, if such be not the case, I shall do him no harm in ascertaining such a fact.\" With this feeling, then, Wurtem Carlis stepped up to tbe door of the All was then as still as the grave. \" What on earth ought I to do V said Wurtem Carlis, \" in an emergency like this ? Ought I to stand here keeping watch while that man, whose name I don't even know, for 1 feel assured that it is not Jan-Van, prepetrates some villany ? Oh, no \u2014 no.\" Wurtem advanced two steps towards the door of the chamber into which Jan- Van had gone, and then he paused again. \" No \u2014 no,\" he said. \" Honour for- chamber into which Jan- Van had gone, bids me to act in such a way. Have I and listened. *-"], [138, "VANDERDECKEN. 128 in the state, and all over the Nether lands, and, indeed, throughout Europe, now?\" \"I thought of nothing, Luca, bat that I had loved you once.\" \" And you love me no more ?\" \" No more !\" CHAPTER XXXIX. THE NIGHT'S ADVENTURE IN THE MYSTERIOUS HOUSB CONTINUES. We do not intend to take upon our selves to say whether Wurtem Carlis was right or wrong in listening to what was going on in the chamber. All we assert is, that he thought he was right, or else he would not have done so ; and what a man thinks is right in honour, is to him so right in all circumstances, and to all intents and purposes. At first Wurtem Carlis could hear nothing but sobs, for the mysterious Jan-Van had left off speaking, and the wife of the German dragoon, as he had said she was, was evidently too deeply affected to speak. This silence, though, did not last for long. It was broken by Jan-Van. \" Ob, this is hard to hear from you. Very hard, indeed.\" \" It may be so, and, no doubt, it is. But could you think me so dead to all self-respect\" as to admit that I still love one who conld have stooped ao low as you have, Luca? No. My love has altered its complexion.\" \" How so ?\u2014 Alas ! how so i What complexion does it wear?\" \" That of pity.\" \" Ob, Heaven ! And I have lived to be pitied by one whom I refused \u2014 \" \" Ay, and one whom you refused, too, with flippant scorn, Luca. Do yon not re member when at the court of Pomerania, in the orange-grove, I told you that I loved you ? ' \" I bo ! Oh, yes, I do !\" \" Well, you told .me that you neie forced to wed no one whose destiny was not much higher than mine.\" \" I did\u2014 I did !\" \"Oh, Luca \u2014 Luca!\" he said\u2014 \"oh, Luca !\" \" What the deuce does he mean by\u2014 ' Oh, Luca ?' \" thought Wurtem. \"Yes,\" said, or rather sobbed, a female voice. Wurtem, then, came to the conclusion that Luca was the name of the young lady who was the wife or the mistress of the German dragoon. \" Can you look me in the face?\" said Jan- Van, and it was evident that his voice shook as he spoke. \" No,\" said the young lady. \"Well,\" added Jan-Van, \"where there is shame there is yet virtue.\" Now, after all, Wurtem Carlis ought to have been satisfied that Jan- Van was not the bad fellow he had suspected him to be, for people, when they are about villanous actions, \u25a0 do not usually call others' attention to virtue, and he ought to have left the door, but he did not. \"I hear you,\" said the young lady. \" Have you said all to me that you have to say ?\" \" No, Luca.\" \" And you knew me as a gentleman and a soldier. Well, I was beneath your notice, and in three months afterwards you eloped from your father's court with a dragoon, whose sole merit in your eye seems to be that he was big and fat. Oh, Luca ! Luca ! this from you !\" The girl upon this gave a scream, partly of rage, and partly of grief; ausl then she said \u2014 \" And so, you don't love me now P\" \" I do not.\" \"Then go away. I don't want you here. Why do you come to me, if you do not love me ? What do 1 want with you here? All you have got to do is not to interfere with me or my fortune. Leave me to my fate, since you dp not love me.\" \"No. That I won't do. I have let ters from your father.\" \" Say on. I ought to listen.\" \" You shall hear all. This is my second visit to this house.\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no !\" \" I will show them to you.\" '\u2022 No, no, I say again. I will not see them. Go away, aud leave me. I do not want you.

I am a princess, and I con sidered myself entitled to do so if I thought proper.\" \"Well now, indeed, Luca, I think that you are mad ; but I thank you for directing me to where I can find a glass of water.

Has Jan- Van murdered her at last !\" Poor Wnrtem was in an agony of apprehension, for although the conver sation of the young lady was certainly not such as would attract any one to admire her, yet it seemed a horrible thing to murder her. While he was thinking what he ought to do, the door of the room was opened suddenly, and Jan-Van looked out. \" Hilloa ! my friend.\" \"Yes. It is I,\" said Wurtem. \" So close to the door, too ! Have \"Listen! \u2014 By force it would be easy enough to lay hold of you and of the ras cal who brought you away from your father's court ; but such a course would induce a certain amount of publicity, which it is wished, for your sake as well as for the sake of your afflicted family, to avoid. It is, therefore, proposed by me that you should quit this house with me secretly, and I will have you conducted to your father's house, and there you will be kept in secret in one of the Ducal Palaces ; and your betrayer, the ruffian who has torn you from virtue and repute, will have no clue to your retreat.

I do not wish to hear of my former home nor of my rela tions again.

But I am faint. Oh, Luca, could you give me a glass of water ? It is all the hospitality I ask of you listened ?\" \" I have.\" \" Was that well done of you, Wurtem Carlis ?\" \" No, I\u2014 I\u2014 don't think it was ; but I had apprehensions that you were a bold,"], [141, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 131 bad man only, when I heard sobs coming from the room; and the agony of being made your unsuspecting accomplice was such, that I could not help listen ing. That is the whole truth.\" \" Then, Wurtem Carlis, I tell you it was not well done of you. I do not say that I despise you for acting as you have, but again I say that it was not well done.\" though he meant to do so himself, he turned away again, and motioned to the young man to take her in his arms, and follow with her from the house. Upon this, Wurtem very carefully wrapped her up in the huge cloak in such a style that it was impossible for her to move hand or foot even if she should recover her consciousness ; but he was careful not to cover her face, so that she run no risk of suffocation in his hands. He then lifted her from the ground with ease, for her weight was as nothing to him, and turning to Jan-Van he said \u2014 Wurtem was silent. \" But yet,\" added Jan-Van, \" my dear Wurtem, I do not think that it was very unnatural that you should do as you have done ; and, after all, I blame my self more than I do you. If I had trusted you, it would have been better. But now tell me what you know.\" \"Little enough beyond the fact that I now \"eel that 1 may think as I wished to think.\" \" Which way shall we go ?\" \" Happily, by the regular door of the house,\" said Jan-Van. \" If we can but gain the banks of the canal, we shall be all right. Good fortune attends us, for the sot of a German dragoon comes not home.\" \" You speak in riddles. What do you mean I\" \" I will follow you, then, Mynheer.\" \" Do so. This way.\" The corridor in which they were was of considerable extent, and grim, oad looking Dutch portraits were upon the walls of it. They seemed to scowl at Wurtem Carlis as he went. \" That I wished to think you great and good, and that now 1 know you are such.'' \" Ah ! Great, said you ?\" \"Are not the good the truly great ? for although you are but. a soldier, yet your errand here is one of mercy.\" \" True, Wurtem, you are right. Let there be no ill blood, not even ihe shadow of a vexation between us, and let us now carry off the giri.\" \" Will she come ?\" \" You find the carrying her irksome to yon ?\" said Jan-Van. \"Oh, no, not at all. But if you would rather take her yourself, do not hesitate.\" \" No \u2014 no. I loved her once, and it would break my heart to held her in my arms again. I cannot do it.\" \" Then leave her to me, Mynheer.\" They reached the head of the stairs, aud Jan-Van had begun the descent, when a sudden laugh from the street smote upon their ears, accompanied by the shout of the chorus of a drinking song, and at the same moment there was the rattle of a key in the lock of the street-door of the house. \" Follow me ! You will see that she will come.\" \u25a0 With these words, Jan-Van wens into the room, and was closely followed by Carlis, where, to his surprise, he saw the young girl, and she looked almost a child, lying as though dead upon the floor of the apartment, which was but a newly got up bed-chamber. \" There she is, my friend. We will wrap her in this cloak, and carry her off with us.\" \" Is she really living?\" \" She is. It will be many hours be fore she again awakens to a conscious ness of her condition ; but she lives, and the cause of her trance will leave no ill effect behind it. Can you not take my word for as much as that ?\" CHAPTER XL. WUETEM AND JAN -VAN HAVE TO EIGHT EOR THEIK LIVES. This sudden arrival of the drunken German dragoon with his dissolute com panions at such a moment, was a most cruel blow of fate. If but five minutes more had elapsed, Jan-Van and Wurtem \" I can, and do.\" It seemed that Jan- Van wished Wur- tem Carlis lo carry the young girl, for although he moved towards her as"], [142, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 132 would both have been clear of the house with the insensible Luca. \"No doubt of that, you hog!\" \" Hilloa !

Go to-bed !\" \" We are lost !\" said Wurtem. \" No, not till we are killed, and then churchmen will tell you we are found,\" said Jan-Van. \"But keep here on the corridor. You are armed ?\" \" I have a good sword.\" \" And I another, my friend ; so we must just fight for it, if it comes to that. Listen!\" They both shrunk back from the staircase, but not so far as to prevent them from hearing all that passed below. The chorus of the drinking song went on merrily, although, from the tipsy pronunciation of those who gave utter- ance to it, it was quite evident that it was as much at they could do to articu late it at all. _ \"Come in, then, Trucklemaun, and Hubert, and you, Swifenhausen.

And now shut the door.\" Bang! went the door of the house, and, half-drunk as he was, the German dragoon busied himself with its fasten ings. \" It is as I suspected,\" whispered Jan- Van. \" He has brought three of his drunken companions into the house with him.\" \"Prink, drink, drink \u2014 No nutter what yon drink, boys ; Never think \u2014 never think, For that will spoil your drink, boys. Hsrrah !\" They then yelled like fiends, and in the midst of all these discordant noises the door was opened by the German dra goon, and with a sudden 'bang it struck against the wall of the passage. \" Good-night, and the devil take you all, then, as you won't come in !\" roared a voice. \"Good night, and may you find a wet winding-sheet in the first canal you come to !\" \" So it seems. But two sober men are more than a match for four drunkem ones.\" \" Yes, that may be. But look how we are loaded.

Come on, up-stairs !'* roared the thiek, hoarse voice of the Ger man trooper. \" We will go and sing a song to my young wife. No doubt she has Deen waiting for me. Let's go up to her room and sing her a song, and make her have something to drink with us. Come on ! come on !\" This was a proposition which seemed to startle a little even the drunken com panions of the brutal rascal who had de coyed Luca from her father's home and one of them said \u2014 \"Yes; it seems so. Let us wait, though. It is not his custom.\" \"Well, good-night!\" cried half-a dozen tipsy voices outside the house. \" Good-night.

I'll warrant I shall drink my share, not withstanding.\" \" Oh, never mind her, Mynheer.

The German trooper and his three companions now mouuted the top of the stairs, and then he roared out to them \u2014 \" So, you won't give the princess a song ?\" '\u2022 No, no, no !\" they all said. \"Thunder and lightning, though, I'll see if she oe a*ake !\" \" A thousand curses on yen ! Come where you will, then. But we will go up stairs, for at this hour of the night, I tell you, there are rats, and beetles, and un clean things in the lower rooms, and they fall off the old ceiling into a man's drink with an odd sort of splash, and 1 don't like them. What, in the name of all that's d \u2014 able, makes you live in such a damp country as this, my friends ?\" \" We cannot help it, Mynheer Grog enhoff\u2014 we cannot help it, and that is the sole reason.\" With this, the fellow staggered to the door of the chamber where Jan- Van and Wurtem Carlis were. The former at once blew out ttie little light they had, and by the time the trooper opened the door and cried \"Hilloa!\" the plaee was in the most profound darkness. \" What ! no light I Wake up, Luca ! A thousand devils ! do you hear me and don't wake up, you little wretch !\" No reply came to this affectionate ap peal. To be sure, Wurtem did think of saying a word or two, but he checked the impulse, and after a moment or two, during which he was, no doubt, listening as intently as he could, the trooper cried \u2014 \"Go to the devil, then, and follow me ! They now began to ascend the stair case, and although Jan- Van and Wurtem Carlis might very well suppose them selves to be a match for four drunken men, yet it was manifestly their policy to avoid a collision with them if they possi bly could do so ; and, therefore, it was, that as the drunken crew approached the stairs' head they retreated with their burthen, until they got right into the caamber again from which they had taken the young girl. \"Thev will not come here,\" said Jan- Van, \" 1 think.\" \"There is no intention, now,\" said Wurtem, \" to seek this chamber ; but if they do, fight we must. There is no other resource for us.\" \" 1 hear her breathing. How sound she sleeps. D \u2014 n her, when the jewels are gone, I will see if no one will give me a good round sum for her. I am tired of her, but she might tempt some one else. Ah, we will think about that when the gold and the jewels are gone.\" With these words, he staggered from the room door, beyond whicli he had not advanced, and they heard him shouting the chorus of the drinking song as he proceeded to join his companions. \" 1 his is a narrow escape,\" said Jan- \" None whatever. Let us wait a lit- 1 tie.

A hat lay in the passage, and a cloak. No doubt they both belonged to the German trooper, or to one of his drunken companions ; but Jan- Van kicked them aside and proceeded at once to the door leading to the street. \" Wurtem,\" he said, \" Wurtem Carlis?'' \" It is, indeed. One could almost loathe her.\" \" My friend, I loved this girl once, but now when I think about her there does come over me a sensation which I can only call loathing ; and were it not that I have made a promise to her father to rescue her, if possible, from this de grading companionship, she might re main here and take her chance of all that might occur. My love turned to pity, but that pity even has fled and turned to loathing.\" \" I cannot wonder at it, Mynheer Jan- Van.\" \"Yes, I'm here.\" \" Hold the light forme. There is some complicated fastening to this door which may yet fail us. Confound the fellow ! this is some contrivance ofhis own.\" \" Well \u2014 well, we will not talk of her. Let us step out into the corridor, and try to find out what our chances are.\" They cautiously left the chamber, and, guided by the sound of the drunken voices of Grogenboff and his friends, they found that they had taken posses sion of the very chamber in the roof of which was the trap-door, so that that mode of leaving the house was cut off. \" What is it like ?\" \" A chain linked in some manner so that it seems a matter of impossibility ever to get it straight again.\" \" It is, perhaps, by accident, after all, that he has so twisted it. Let me try, if you will take the girl a moment.'' \" Ob, no \u2014 no. Ah, I have got it to move at last. I think I have forced the chain out of its twistings. Yes, Carlis, I shall be able to do it. Hold the light a little closer, my triend.\" \u2022' Yes. Here it is.\" The roaring and shouting of the drunken men above came upon their ears, and Jan- Van was fast getting the chain undone, when they heard the voice cf the German trooper at the top of tbe stairs, crying out \u2014 \" Be quiet, whoever you are, and I'll bring you liquor \u2014 I will soon be back with you \u2014 ay, and good liquor, too, I will bring you. I will say that of (his damp city of Amsterdam, that a mancan get good liquor in it. Thunder and the devil ! I'm only surprised that my wife don't wake up, as she usually does.\" The situation of Wurtem Carlis and Jan-Van was now most critical it was impossible to get the chain that held the door undone before the German troop :r should gain the passage, and thus they were exposed to the full glare of a lamp that be carried in his rig.it hand, while a bunch of keys dangled from his left. \" We are unlucky,\" said Jan- Van, \" provided we cannot leave by the com mon door below, leading into the street. If we can only manage that, all will yet be well.\" \" Let us try it at once,\" said Wur tem Carlis. \" We do not by any means increase our chances by delay.\" \"Come on, then. Carry the girl, I beg of you. I cannot do so.\" \" Think nothing of that. I can warmly appreciate your feelings regarding her. 1 will carry her, and, although 1 have no respect for her I will carry her with all the care as i hough 1 had.\" Once more, then, Wurtem Carlis took the girl in his arms, but this time he thought there w as a slight movement of her feet, and that she sighed once. He fancied that these might be preparatory symptoms of her recovery ; but he did not say anything to Jan-Van about it, for he thought they would be soon out cf the house now. He carried her partly on his shoulder, with his left arm encircling her, so that he left his right hand at liberty to fight, if there should be any occasion to draw his sword. Jan-Van did not think it prudent to procure a light again lili they got right down the staircase ; but when they reached the passage below he ignited a \" Ah !\" chuckled the German trooper \" I will say that much for Hollind, that it s a place where a man may get plenty of good drink.\" \" Confound the fellow !\" whispered Jan- Van. \" What can we do now ?* \" Fight him,\" said Wurtem."], [145, "THE PLYING DUTCHMAN. 135 \" Yes ; but I did not wish to shed blood if it could by any means have been helped, although this is one of the many fellows who tried to take my life, when you, my good friend, rescued me.\" \" Well, Mynheer Jan -Van, you take care of the girl ; and if this drunken rascal should really see us, I will meet him. I think 1 shall be a match for him, big as he is. Ah ! he comes.\" \"Be careful, Wurtem.\" \"I will\u2014 I will!\" Jan-Van, instead of leaving Carlis now to meet the trooper, advanced a pace or two. as he went to his companions to come down and bring him his sword. \" Come \u2014 come !\" he cried. \" A thousand devils, here are thieves in the house ! Do you hear them ? Come down, I say, and bring me my sword. It lies up against the chimney-piece. Quick ! Come down !\" \" The chain of tbe door,\" said Wur tem. \" Can you release it, Jan-Van ?\" \" I will try.\" \" It is our only chance of avoiding bloodshed now.\" \" I know it.\" Jan- Van was in the dark ; so, aithougn he made every possible exertion to undo the chain from the door, he only appeared to complicate it the more, and even he could not help uttering a malediction upon it. \" Are you succeeding ?\" v \"No! By Heaven\u2014 no!\" *' What is to be done, then, Mynheer Jan- Van P\" CHAPTER XLI. WURTEM CABUB HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH A SIU GUI-Alt BJOtMi. \"Ah, yes!\" chuckled the German, \"I do admit that next to my own beautiful Germany, a man may get drunk in Holland with the greatest satisfaction to himself; so I think I will remain here while the money lasts. Yes, I have now made np my mind, and I am a fellow of determination ; so it is not at all likely that I shall be induced to change it again.\" There was now just one chance for Jan- Van and his young friend, and that was, that tbe drunken German might, when he got to the foot of the stairs, at once turn to the left to seek the drink that he was in quest of without so much as casting a glance to the door. He reached the foot of the stairs, and then, unhappily, the girl uttered a groan, which in that place, arched as it was, struck upon the ears of the German. \"We must fight.\" \" Well, be it so, since there is no other course now open to us ; and recol lect now, Mynheer, that we are two to four.\" \" Yes, but the passage is narrow, and I think if we keep our backs to the door, here, we shall protect them from taking us at any disadvantage.\" \"Yes. That is good counsel. Now for it.\" \"But the girl?\" ** Oh, I have laid her along the floor close to the door, so that as long as we ; live she is protected.\" \" That will do.\" * The furious cries of the German trooper had had the effect of thoroughly alarming and partially sobering his three friends above, and they ran out of the room in which they had been drinking with lights in their hands, desiring to know what was the matter. \" Thieves and cutthroats !\" cried the j German. \"They are in the passage ] below. Where is my sword ? Quick- quick, or they will escape us, my good friends.\" \" Here is your sword. How many of them are there P\" \" I don't know, but we will count them when we have slain them ; so now \" Thunder and lightning !\" he said, \" what was that P\" As he spoke, he held his light high above his head, and knitting his brows, he glanced along the passage. That they were discovered, was now a fact past all dispute, and whatever the con sequences of that discovery were likely to be, they were now to be immediately looked for. \u25a0 \" Ah !\" cried the German. \"Thieves ind cutthroats \u2014 ah !\" Instead, then, of advancing upon them, he turned and rushed up stairs, shouting come on.\" This was not exactly the state of"], [146, "VANDERDECKEN. 136 rush, crying out thereupon, in a hoarse voice, \"Come on,\" he made a dash forward against the foe. His three friends were ashamed not to follow him, and a melee now took place of rather a fearful character. The passage, unfortunately, was just wide enough to let some four or five people stand abreast in it ; and although it certaiuly was an advantage to Wurtem Carlis and Jan-Van that they were in so narrow a place, yet it did not follow as a consequence that their flank might not be turned by some one of the four, while they were engaged with the others. things that seemed to be tbe most agree able to the guests of the German, and, although they had arms in their hands, they hesitated a little about advancing. \" What,\" shouted the German, \" are ye cowards, after all ? Is it true that your true Dutchman is great at drinking but small at fighting P\" \" No \u2014 no. Come on, then.\" With this reproach ringing in their ears, they rattled down the stairs, hold ing the lights so that they might see the number of their foes, and they soon had the satisfaction of knowing that there were but two to oppose them in the passage. It was really wonderful to see how the courage of the three friends of the German trooper rose upon their making this discovery. They became quite eager for the fray, and began to swear in the most dreadful manner, and to clash their swords together and to make such a racket that it was quite dreadful to bear them. This was, in fact, what did happen. Already had Wurtem inflicted a wound upon the German trooper, who, the moment he saw his own blood, began to fight like a maniac. Jan- Van run one of the bottle companions right through the body, and he fell dead with a groan. It was then that the German, sudt denly turning aside, made a dash pas- Jan- Van, and got behind Wurtem Carlis, whom he grappled by the back of the neck with a yell of satisfaction, and was shortening his sword to run him through, when it was knocked from his grasp by Jan-Van, who cried \u2014 \" Ah ! they fly, the cowards ! They fly!\" The fact was, that the other two, finding things were not going on exactly in the order that they thought comport. able, made a rush to the staircase, and ran up them at great speed, so that the German was left alone with his foes- He was disarmed likewise. \" Surrender, you wretches \u2014 sur render !\" they cried, \" or we will soon make mince-meat of you.\" \" Do not answer them,\" said Jan- Van, in a low tone. \"I will not,\" replied Carlis, \"ex cept with my sword's point.\" Now, although there were four men to two, yet there was something so cool, assured, and dangerous-looking in the attitudes that J an- Van and Wurtem Carlis took up at the end of the passage, that braver men than the trooper and his friends might very well have paused a moment or two before commencing tbe attack upon them. They stood with their glittering swords in their hands in such positions that it was quite evident they meant to fight ; and from the fixed glitter of their weapons, it was quite evident that they did not shrink from the contest by any means. \" A thousand fiends !\" cried the Ger man, \" who are you ?\" \\ It was then that the rascal showed what great strength and agility ho possessed, for he suddenly shrunk to the ground, and then making a tre mendous bound, he shook off the hold of J an- Van, and alighted a good twelve feet from them both. \"Ah \u2014 ah! Thunder and lightning' Not yet !\" he cried. \"Another sword, and I'll have at them again. Another sword ! Where are you, my brave friends ?\u2014 where are you ?\" The brave friends had reached the top of the staircase ; and there, with no small amount of terror, they were gazing down to see how affairs were going o\u00bb below. No reply came to this, but there the two friends stood calmly upon the defensive, awaiting the attack. The German saw that the courage of bis three friends of the bottle was fast evaporating, and, perhaps, he did not feel quite bo assured himself; so he thought if anything wasUo be done, it had better be done at once ; and with a"], [147, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE PLYING DUTCHMAN. 137 \"Don't let him escape!\" said Jan- Van, as he advanced ; but the German suddenly stooped again, and lifting up the dead body of the man who had been slain by Jan-Van, he fairly flung it at them both with a force that, if it did not knock them down, arrested their progress sufficiently to enable him (the German) to rush up the stairs. \" That will do. Ten thousand devils 1' THE BOATMAN WAITING THE RETURN OF VANDERDECKEN FROM THE PHANTOM SHIP. he cried, \"that' will do. Give me another sword, my brave friends, and we are one too many for them yet.\" \" Yes,\" said the two friends, faintly, \" Where is Swifenhausen ?\" \" Oh !\" said the two friends. \" What, do you shrink ? I thought when I told you your friend was dead, that it would move you to fury \u2014 that it would make you fight like lions. Does \"Dead!\" it not do so 1\" Ho.

If you don't surrender this moment and cry foi mercy, I will blow you both to atoms with ease.\" \" No; at all,\" said the two friends, and off they set along the corridor as hard as they could go, leaving the German to stand the brunt of any ter mination of the contest alone as best he might. __III$_,_-I1.. This was not exactly the state of things that suited the German ; but he was half maddened by the wound he had received, and by the fight altoge ther, and he roared and stormed like a bull, and kept calling his two dear friends such dreadful names, that if words would have killed any one, they would soon have ceased to be of the land of the living. CHAPTER XLII. WURTEM IS FULL OE GRIEF ABOUT EIS LOVE. \" Stoop, Carlis !\" cried Jan-Van. Wurtem flung himself on the ground, and Jan- Van made a dash towards the \" Come back, you wretches !\" he shouted. \" Is this the way you treat a man whose liquor you drink, till you can drink no more ? Is this the way you repay me for sucking up my old schnops as if you were two sand-banks, you vile impostors? Come back \u2014 come back!\" It was all in vain. The German trooper might rave as much as he liked ; but the two friends had had quite enough of it, aud they were only now intent upon some mode of ensuring their own safety. The German soon saw that it was pretty evident the foe in the passage had no intention of acting upon the offensive, or they would ere that time have made some movement to follow him up stairs ; so he was just as boisterous as he liked to be from the. head of the staircase, while Jan- Van made every possible effort to open the door, and Wurtem Carlis kept the point of his sword extended, and had at the staircase. The German trooper fired, and ttie whole contents of the carbine went over the heads of his foes and lodged in the street-door. Had they been the slightest degree less prompt in what they did, there can be no question but they would both have fallen before the murderous discharge of that carbine ; but the trooper was taken by surprise in consequence of the rapidity of action. Jan-Van did not wait to give him time to load it again, but, with his drawn sword in his hand, he rushed up the staircase, and he was almost at the top of it before the German saw him. As he went, Jan- Van, with his left hand, caught up one of the candles, so that he had no fear of being left in the corridor in the dark ; and now a chase began, which, if it had not been one of life and death, would have partaken something of the ludicrous. The Ger man turned and fled with the discharged carbine in his grasp, making frantic efforts as he ran to reload it, while Jan- Van kept close at his heels, every now arid then making a lounge with his sword in the hope of touching him with it ; and he did succeed in giving him several slight wounds, which only had the effect of goading the trooper to in. creased speed. In this way they went on till they reached the end of the corridor, and then, as the trooper could get no further, he suddenly turned and levelled a blow at the bead of Jan- Van with the butt-end of the carbine, whicb, if it had taken effect, would have put an end to the contest at once ; but it happily did not, time a wary eye upon the trooper. The bottle friends had placed their lights upon the staircase as they fled, so that the light that shone now with tolerable brilliance was between the con tending parties, and acting very impar tially towards both of them. . Suddenly the German disappeared. \" He is gone,\" said Wurtem. \" Dead, do you mean ?\" \" Oh, no, but he has fled along the corridor.\" \" Then you may depend he will come back again. It bodes us no good for him so to fly.\" This was a prediction upon the part of Jan-Van that was very shortly con firmed, for the German soon came back"], [149, "THE PLYING DUTCHMAN. 139 for Jan-Van stepped nimbly aside and avoided it. As the trooper rose the carbine to re peat the blow, Jan- Van, with one whirl of his sword, brought its point to the vil lain's heart, and run him through, pinning him to the old wainscot panel, against which he was standing, so tightly, that although he pulled with all his strength to do so, Jan-Van could not get his sword away again. Sickened, then, at the sight of the horrible form of the dying man, he gave up the attempt, and left him against the wall, with the handle of his sword pro jecting from his breast. Jan-Van s'ill held the light in his hand, and he hurried now to the passage again, looking very pale and wan. \" It is all over,\" he said. \" What has happened, my friend \u2014 what has happened ? Are you hurt ?\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no. The German \u2014 he is dead !\" come to the rescue of Jan-Van from the ruffians, who otherwise would, no doubt, have taken his life. He followed quite to the brink of the canal, and then Jan- Van called aloud, and a boat speedily made its appearance, and a couple of men sprang to the shore. \"Take this person,\" said Jan-Van, pointing to the girl, \"and place her carefully in the boat. Mind that you do not hurt her.\" \" Yes, Mynheer,\" said th# men, re spectfully. They then took the still insensible form of the trooper's mistress from the hands of Wurtem Carlis, and placed it in the boat. Jan-Van sprang after them ; and then waving his hand to Wurtem, he cried \u2014 \" Good-night !\" This cavalier-like mode of getting rid of him, after all that they had fjone through together upon that night, jarred terribly upon the feelings of Wurtem and he made no reply. \" Hilloa, Carlis !\" said Jan-Van, when the boat had got a little way into the stream ? \"Oh, that is quite another thing. You do not regret that ?\" \" Not exactly regret it, but yet I am sorry that there has been such a neces sity, that is all. If 1 could have avoided it I would.\" \" Well ?\" \" You will hear of me again ; and, in the meantime, you can hold the price of the contract in your own hands, and let Mynheer Von Rotter have it or not, at your own good pleasure. Good- night !\" \"Good-night!\" said Wurl em Carlis, but he said it rather mechanically than with any feeling for the words ; lor he still felt very much hurt at. the manner in which Jau-Van parted with him. The boat slowly disappeared from before his eyes as the rowers lazily urged it through the waters ; and in the cou?se of three minutes there was poor Wuriem Car.is, after ali his dangers \u2014 all his courage, left shivering ou the banks of a canal, while the iran for whom he had done so much had been satisfied to leave him with a cold good- night. \" Well\u2014 well,\" said Wurtem, after a few minutes' thought, \" it dou't matter if I and this Jan-Van should never meet again. Perhaps I ought to be quite satisfied with the substantial proofs that he has already given me of his gratitude, for has be not placed ample pounds at my disposal by opening a credit foi me \" No doubt. A brave man always dislikes to shed blood ; but in this case I feel assured that it was not to be avoided. Por heaven's sake let us leave this place now as soon as we pos sibly can.\" \" Amen to that, my friend. Hold me the light, then, while once again I make a trial to undo this door, the difficulty connected with which has been the cause of aU this tumult. Ab, it is done.\" \" Already?\" \" les, the chain has cracked asunder at last by my repeatedly twisting it, and all is well. Come, my friend \u2014 come quickly. Take up tlie girlj and let us leave this dreadful house.\" Wurtem Carlis was quite as willing as Jan- Van could possibly be to leave the house in which they had encountered so much danger ; and lifting once more the young girl in his arms, he passed out into tbe street. \" This way \u2014 this way f\" said Jan-Van, as he went with rapid strides in the direction of the canal. Carlis now fully recollected the spot upon which they were. It was the same where he had"], [150, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 140 at the great banking hotse of Von Rotter and Co ?\" love her. Bid her look back to all the tender words that you have mutually spoken to each other. Bid her to cast aside the pride that now would prompt her to deny you, and be happy with her. Can you forgive me ?\" \" Forgive you ?' \" Yes ; I thought to do that which would have needed all your forgiveness. But I have no right to wrestle with a destiny that in me has spoken out aloud.\" \" I do not rightly understand to what you allude, I fear,\" said Wurtem Car lis. \" But if you think that you have offended me, I truly forgive you.\" \"That is well. And now, young man, the morning air is already sighing through the branches of those old trees, and awa kening the lazy oennant from many a mast-h-ad along the old quays of Amster dam. Go at once to the house of Voa Straken, and speak to her who sigheth there, and whose heart is heavy.\" \" 1 will ! I will ! But before we part, let me ask of you one question.\" \" Ask it.\" This was all very well in its way, and it was all very well for Wurtem Carlis to try to persuade himself into a belief that Jan- Van had behaved all right to him; for, somehow, he had taken a great attachment to that mysterious personage; but yet in his inmost heart he did not feel satisfied that he should be so coolly shuffled off. \" We shall not meet again,\" he said, \" I daresay, after this. If Jan- Van had had any notion that we should meet again, or any wish that way tending, he would have said something of it ; but he did not, so that is over.\" The idea that all Jan- Van wanted of him was his assistance in getting the young girl away from the trooper, and that as that was accomplished their acquaintance was over, seemed to be the most natural one to adopt uuder the circumstances; so Wurtem Carlis walked slowly from the spot. Some one touched his arm. \"Ah ! who is that ?\" cried Wartein. \" I would fain know who and what you really are. Superstition would point you as something too (err.ble to think of ; but I am not superstitious, and I would fain hear from your own lips who and what you are.\" \" Seek not, Wurtem Carlis, for that knowledge which it is not, good to know.\" \" Nay, but what possible harm can result from knowledge of any kind ? I am not among those who think that in formation can by any means be ill.\" \"You are wrong. Look at yon moon, now, thai, is struggling with the day light, and which will soon have all its tender glories eclipsed by the bright* sun.\" \"A friend.\" \" Show yourself, then ! Why do you keep in the shadow of that tree for }\" \"Look at me.\" The dim figure of a tall man stepped out from the shadow of a tree, and Wurtem Carlis, as he looked upon the pale face that was just discernible by the night light, started as he said, in a low voice \u2014 \"Why, you are he who \u2014 who \u25a0 \" \" Would have wedded Whilelmina Von Straken I\" \" Yes, the same \u2014 the same ! Now, I know your voice, and you are like wise \" Wurtem Carlis looked at it. \" Hush ! No more. Heed not now who or what 1 am. Go to the maiden whom you love.

I have yet questions to ask of you. Appear to me again, I beg of you, be you whom you may !\" All was still. Far off at the other end of the thoroughfare Wurtem thought he saw a dim-looking figure striding along, and he pursued it, with the hope that it might be the mysterious person age ; but it got out of his sight round a corner before he could come up with it, and he paused to gather breath. \"What am I to think of this r\" he said. \" Is the advice good or bad that this mysterions being gave to me ? Shall I go to Straken's house again, or shall I avoid it ? Ah ! Whilelmina ! if all else were false that came from his lips, he told the truth when he said I loved you still !\" why did you ever dream of giving your self to another !\" This was so agonizing a reflection that the young lover was half inclined to go away again, and leave the faithless Whil elmina to her fate ; but then he thought of what the mysterious stranger had said to him \u2014 that man who was something more than man, surely, and who, after he had spoken, had disappeared so suddenly and so inexplicably. \" Yes ! yes ! all he said is true !\" said Wurtem. \" I do love her ! I do, indeed, and in truth, love her still !\" At this moment, a slight noise in the direction of the old house attracted Wurtem Carlis's attention, and looking up to it he saw a casement open, and a face appeared at it that he knew well. It was the face of his Whilelmina. Wurtem stood transfixed with love and amazement to see that she breathed the cool breeze of the morning at so early an hour ; but she did not see him, for she looked up to the sky, and clasped her hands and seemed to be praying in great agony of spirit. Then she covered her face with both her hands and sunk down near the window-sill ; and even where he was, Wurtem Carlis could hear her sobbing. This was a sight and a hearing that no lover could withstand \u2014 at least, it would require a very cold, phlegmatic sort of lover, indeed, to withstand as much, and Wurtem Carlis came up to no such conditions. Darting over the roadway at once, then, he called out\u2014 \" Whilelmina ! \u2014 my Whilelmina !\" With quite a nice little scream, she looked out, and when she saw that it, was Wurtem Carlis, who had refused her in the church of St. Nicholas, she took no notice of him, but shut the window at once, with a vehemence that could not be mistaken. The young man continued now to muse on the extraordinary adventure that had befallen him, and yet he walked on, and as if fate would have it, he went the nearest way towards the house of Von Straken. Suddenly, upon looking up, Wurtem Carlis found himself actually in front of the well-known house, and he started at the sight of it. \"Oh! what folly \u2014 what madness it was of me,\" he said, \" when I might have made Whilelmina mine in tbe church of St. Nicholas, to refuse her as I did ! Oh ! I was mad ! \u2014 mad to do so !\" \"Oh, Whilelmina!\" he cried, \"in repentance I come to you, and is this the way that you receive me ?\" He might just as well have held his peace, for Whilelmina did not in tbe slightest degree deign to return any an swer to this speech, and there poor Wurtem Carlis stood in quite a forlorn kind of attitude, gazing up at the win dow, and hoping that she would appear, against all probability. The morning brightened, and several CHAPTER, XLIII. WHttELMINA BF.HAVSS WITH A PROPER SPIRIT. The morning was now, indeed, coming on with rapid strides, and the topmost windows of the old house of Mynheer Von Straken were glittering in the first rays of the sun. \"Ah !\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"this is the home of all that I hold dear in the world! Oh! Whilelmina! Whilemina!"], [152, "142 VANDERDECKEN ; OR, people passed by, but Carlis took no notice of them, although they, in a quiet, Dutch sort of way, stared rather at him, and quietly walked a long way round him, with a decided notion that he was a little mad. \"She will not come!\" lie said, \" Alas ! she will not come, and I shall be desolate. Oh ! why did I refuse that lovely hand in the church ? Why am I so blinded and besotted by pas sion ?\" This despair of Wurtem Carlis's ought to have moved the heart of a flint ; but then we happen to know, that the heart of a flint is much more easily warmed than the heart of a woman who thinks herself scorned and slighted. We do not take upon ourselves exactly to say that, notwithstanding all her indignation, the fair Whilelmina was watching Wurtem Carlis from the casement ; but we think it very likely. \"lean bear this no longer!\" cried Wurtem. \"I will at once speak to Mynheer Von Straken, and put an end to this misery.\" With this determination, although it did not follow quite clearly that the misery was to be put an end to by if, Carlis went soberly up to the merchant's door, and knocked for admission. A t that early hour he ought certainly to have asked himself the simple ques- tion of whether it was likely the mer- chant was up or not ; but we should just like to know when it is that lovers ask themselves simple or reasonable questions ? Well, the door was opened by the old servant, who was up to light the fire, and who, having performed that opera- tion in the great kitchen, was not by any means improved in her personal appearance by the soot that she had got upon ber hands, and liberally transferred to her face at odd times and in odd places. \" I say, sir \u2014 if you please, sir,\" said a voice, \" hold your iow, do.\" It was Tom Simpson and Co-, who now stood a little distance from Wur tem Carlis, and seemed to wish to say something to him, although he appeared at the same time half afraid to do so. \"Is that you, idiot ?\" said Wurtem. f ,: Well, I suppose I must say it is, although that ain't the most compli mentary way to say anything to a fellow, I can tell you.\" \" What do you want here ? Are you tired of your life, and wish me to sacri fice it to my just resentment ?\" \" Oh, dear, no ! I only meant to say that if you have made up your mind, as I think you have, not to have anything more to say to Miss Whilelmina Straken, considering her, as you seem to do, to be not up to sample \u2014 \" \" Not what ?\" \" I mean, rather a damaged bit of goods, you know, and \" \" Wretch ! Dare to say one word against that most incomparable and lovely girl, and I shall feel that I do a good act, entitling me to tbe thanks cf society, by throttling you first, and then casting you into the nearest canal.\" \" What do you want P\" said the old woman. \" Oh, I am surprised that you should come here.\" \" So am I, my good woman \u2014 so am I,\" said Wurtem Carlis, as he slipped a piece of gold into the old woman's hand. \" The devil you would ! Good-by !\" With this, Tom Simpson and Co. ran off as fast as he could, for he did not at all like the looks of Wurtem Carlis, and had a pretty fair conviction that he would be as good as his word in the matter. \" And yet,\" added the old woman, as she looked at the gold, \"I pity you.\" \" Thank you.\" \"And I know that our child, Whilel mina, did love you as the apple of her eye.\" \"Ah! but why did she go to the church of St. Nicholas to be married to another ?\" \" And has it come to this, indeed, and in truth ?\" sighed Wurtem Carlis, when he was alone again. \" Can it be pos sible that my conduct in the church of St. Nicholas has had the effect of bring ing a whisper of scandal upon the fair name aud fame of my Whilelmina P Oh-oh, Heaven !\" \" She was bewitched.\" \"Bewitched?\" \"Yes, to be sure, poor girl. She was out of her mind, of course, or she never would have gone. I thought you would have had the sense to have seen"], [153, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 143 that, with all your fine knowledge, and your reading, and writing, and all that sort of thing, Master Wurtem Carlis.\" \u00ab' Alas ! \u2014 alas ! But who bewitched herT Carlis who sought the hand of his child, but one who had a good credit at no less a house than that of Von Rotter and Co. Now, the old servant, instead of going near Von Straken, who was lying upon his back between two feather beds in a deep sleep, and snoring dreadfully, took her way at once to Whilelmina, and told her of the arrival of Wurtem, and of what a dismal state of mind he was in. \" The devil, in the shape of Vander decken, The Flying Dutchman !\" As the old servant spoke, she looked suspiciously over her shoulder. \"Well,\" said Wurtem, \"all I wish now is to see Mynheer Straken, and to tell him that I do, indeed, and in truth, love his daughter, and that I was beside myself when I did not accept her hand in the church with joy. That is what I want to say to him, my good friend, and I beg you will tell him that I am here.\" Now, we are afraid that the fair Whil elmina was just a little vindictive, for she was quite delighted to hear how miserable Wurtem Carlis was, and en joyed his remorse and repentance very much. \" 1 should like very much to hear what be has to say,\" she remarked ; \" and I have thought of a plan which will do very well to enable me to do so. I will step into the blue bed-room and get into the bed, and you can draw all the cur tains close, and tell him that my father is there, and then he will say what he has to say, and I shall hear it excellently well.\" \"Ah!\" said tbe old woman, \"we shall see. Come in \u2014 come in. There has been some fine doings in this house, I can tell you.\" \" Fine doings ? What do you mean ?\" \"Ob, I mean that Mynheer Von Straken and Whilelmina have had a great quarrel since they came home from the church of St. INichoias, that's all ! But it is not my place to be prating about what don't concern me; so, perhaps, I have already said too much to you about it.\" \" Oh, no. You have said too little. Recollect, that when I marry Whilel mina, I shall be one of the family.\" '\u25a0 When you marry Whilelmina ? Do you think it possible that she will even think of you now ? Oh, no, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis, you will be very much mistaken if you do, I can assure you. She says that if there is in all the world any one whom she now hates most dread fully and diabolically \u2014 yes, diabolically, which means devilishly, was the very word she used \u2014 it was you.\" \" Oh, no, no ! You must not tell me that.\" \" But, my child, he will expect some reply from your father.\" \"Oh, I can manage that. Do you think that I have quite forgotten the childish talent that used to delight our guests so much some few years ago, and which consisted in imitating the voice and manners of my father ?\" \" I know you used to do so, my dear child ; but you will be nervous, and so betray yourself, and then there is no knowing what may happen.\" \" 0\\?, stuff ! I tell you I am not ner vous at all, and nothing will happen. I am determined upon it, my good Martha, so it is no manner of use for you to try and thwart me in the matter. Youought to know me well enough by this time to feel that when I am resolved upon any thing, nothing will move me.\" \" Alas ! yes ! I know that quite well, for when you were quite a little creature one could never make you alter your mind, or own that you were wrong ; and I have had the rod in my hand for half an-hour together, and could not so much as get a tear from yon, you obstinate lit tle creature, you ! and I have actually been afraid of beating you any more.\" \" Well, well, give me my morning wrapper, and I will represent my lather in this interview.\" \" But I do, and it's the honest truth. However, I will go and speak to Myn heer Straken, and if he likes to see you he may.\" The poor young man was not much elevated by the old woman's description of the sort of feeling that Whilelmina had for him, but yet he hoped to succeed in the course of time in mollifying it, and he was anxious for the interview with Myn heer Von Straken to convince him that it was no longer the penniless Wurtem"], [154, "VANDERDECKEN. 144 The old woman had no resource but to comply with this notion of the fair Whil elmina, so she saw her snugly ensconced in the bed, and drew the old massive cur tains all round it, and then went to sum mon Wurtem Carlis. \" You must know, Mynheer Carlis,\" she said, \" that there is something the matter with my master's own room. The chimney is out of order, so he sleeps in what we call the blue room.\" \" Any room will do, so that I can see him,\" said Wurtem. \" Well, well, what must be will be, and what will be is sure to come to pass ; so you can follow me, and I will conduct you to him at once, Mynheer Carlis.\" hardly have believed it without ocular demonstration of the fact. Now, with the hope that the mer chant would speak first, and so ascertain of what kind of temper he was in, Wurtem was silent for a few moments; but no voice came from the occupant of the bed, so that he felt himself obliged to begin the rather awkward conversa tion. \" Mynheer Von Straken,\" he said. \" you are well aware that I have long loved your fair and incomparable daugh ter, Whilelmina.\" \" Yah !\" said a voice, that was so like Von Straken's, that Wurtem could not entertain the smallest doubt about it. \" Yes, Mynheer, I have long loved your beautiful child ; but, as you know, poverty came upon my house, aud at times I doubted whether, even if she were to consent to become mine, and you were to consent, likewise, ,it would be right and just upon my part to wed her to my broken fortune.\" \"Yah!\u2014 Bah!\" CHAPTER XLIV. WURTEM MAKES A VERY WELCOME AND DELIGHTFUL DISCOVERY. Little did Wurtem imagine, as he followed old Martha, that he was about to be indulged with such an interview as that which was prepared for him. To be sure, his heart throbbed with unusual quickness as he entered the chamber, and there was a heightened colour upon his face; but these symptoms of emotion arose from the doubt as to the sort of re ception he should get from Von Straken. After the scene in the church of St. Nicholas, Wurtem might well have some fears concerning that reception, for the look of Von Straken, when he took his daughter away from the sacred edifice, had shown that he was greatly wounded iu spirit. \"There, Mynheer Catiis,\" said old Martha, \" you had better not disturb our master, but just say what you have got to say to him, and then come away, if you please. He is in bed, and he don't wish the curtains to be touched on any account.\" \"Well, Mynheer, such, however, is not the case now. Providence has, in one of the strangest manners that can be, found me a friend, and I am com paratively rich to what I was, and have such a capital at the banking house of Von Rotter and Co. as will, 1 hope and trust, enable me to retain the fallen fortune of my house,? and once more make the name of Carlis great in Am sterdam.\" \"Pish!\" \" Ab, Mynheer, it is all very well for you to say ' Pish !' but what I tell you is the truth, and nothing but the truth, I assure you. But I can guess what is passing in your miud. You would say, ' What is all this to me V \" \"Ah!\" \" Well, then, Mynheer, I will tell you. It is true that, maddened by jealousy, and quite beside myself at the idea that she had come to be the wife of another to the church of St. Nicholas, I did treat the lovely Whilelmina with scorn ; but, ah ! Mynheer, if I had not loved her as much as I do, I should there and then have married her. My rejection of her showed how much I respected her as well as loved her for her wonder ful beauty.\" \" I have no wish to intrude upon him more than is absolutely necessary,\" said Wurtem, in rather a terrible tone of voice. \" Well, well. That will do.\" The old woman left the room, and closed the door, and Wurtem was alone with Whilelmina, although he little sus pected that such was the case ; and, in deed, if any one had told him that such was the state of affairs, he really would"], [155, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 145 \"Pshaw!\u2014 Bah!\" some strange circumstance, in which her own fair and innocent heart share. Oh, Mynheer ! I know that sh is n t more fair and lovely to look at than she is pure and innocent in thought and action. I wish, now, in the face \"Nay, I beg that you will believe me. I prefer her to all the world ; and the thought that has come over me since is to the effect, that in coming to the church in the way she did, she was the victim of THE BOATMEN'S SURPRISE ON EXAMINI THE GOLD CIV IN BY VANDE .IDKCKEN of Amsterdam and of ail the world, to call her mine ; and perish with my own sword he who shall dare to hint at other than the deepest respect towards the fairest bride in all the universe.\" \" s loved her years ago when she was only a child ; but she was not then more gentle and pleasing than she is now ; and if, Mynheer, you will not favour me now in my suit to her, it will be as well for me to throw myself into the \"Humph!\" No. 19."], [156, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 146 canal, and so end my life and woes together.\" \" Good !\" \" You wish me to do so ?\" \"Be off!\" \"Be off, did you say ? I will not be off! You have, by the manner in which you have treated me, Mynheer, made me desperate, and I will have an answer from you ; 1 will know whether I am to look upon you as a friend or as ah enemy. Come, Mynheer, do not be hiding in that schoolboy-fashion under the cloth ing of your bed, but let me look at you.\" \" Yah, Mynheer.\" \"Oh, Von Straken, pause yet a moment. It may be that Whilelmina yet, in some corner'of her heart, cherishes a spark of love for me.\" \"Go to the devil! Bah! Pose!\" \" You do not think it ? I can tell you, though, Mynheer Von Straken, that if I do not wed her, no one shall. If I set all Amsterdam into a blaze, no one shall wed her. If I dash down every dyke in Holland, and allow the mad surging waters to gallop over the face ot the land, I would rather see the whole country one scene of terror and destruction than another should have her.\" Still nothing conciliatory was spoker, and Wurtem, getting desperate, got hold of a corner of the clothes, and began hauling at it with all his might. The person beneath the clothing held on, and a brief struggle ended in Whilelmina being pulled right off the bed with all its clothing, and lying half smothered on the floor, and unable to release herself from their complicated folds. \"Murder !\" she cried. At this there came such a sound of ironical laughter from the occupant of the bed, that Wurtem Carlis was wonderfully provoked. \"You laugh,\" he said; \"but let me tell you, Mynheer Von Straken, that in so laughing you do not raise your character a bit ; bnt, on the contrary, yon rather provoke the thought that you laugh at feelings too refined for your comprehension.\" The laughter continued. \" Answer me, Mynheer, at once, and answer me candidly. Am I to bear your hostility in my suit to your daughter ?\" \"Ha! ha!\" \"Oh, I will have you out, Mynheer,\" cried Wurtem Carlis, \" I will soon brim; you out. You may cry murder as much as you please, but I will have a thorough explanation with you.\" As he spoke, he pulled away first a sheet, and then a blanket, and then a large counterpane, and then he heard a voice cry \u2014 \"Wurtem \u2014 Wurtem ! it is I. I pray you leave me.\" It was the voice of his own Whilel mina ! Stunned and bewildered for a few minutes at this discovery, the young man stood like one turned to stone, and the fair Whilelmina was just scrambling to the door of the apartment, when he recovered, aud bounded after her aud caught her in his arms. '\u2022 My Whilelmina ! Mv own dear girl !\" \" Unhand me, Mynheer ; I do not like you.\" \" You do, Whilelmina \u2014 you do. Oh, dearest and best, only tell me that you love me still with all your heart, and I am happy.\" \" You are a wretch !\" \"By Heaven, this is too much for human patience ! Are the holiest and best feelings of human nature to be the scoff of a man whose whole soul is so wound up with gilders, that h e can think and dream of nothing else ? I tell yon, Mynheer Von Straken, that I will have your answer.\" As he Spoke, Wurtem, with one dash of his hand, flung aside the curtains from the side of the bed that was nearest to the window, intending to enforce a reply from Von Straken ; but, to his surprise, he could see no one, for the occupant of the bed had popped under the clothes so comfortably as to' be completely covered up from head to foot. \" Anything, my beautiful darling, so that I am yours \u2014 your own Wurtem.\" \" You are a monster !\" \" Yes, I know it ; but you know you have beauty enough \u2014 ay, and plenty to spare, too, for both of us. Blessings on you, my own Whilelmina ! I would have \"This is childish of you,\" said Wurtem. \" Speak to me, I pray you.\""], [157, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 147 {ou always thus reposing upon the heart Vhat is wholly your own.\" \" Will you let me go, Mynheer P\" \" No.\" the joy that was at his heart. All he could do was to wind his arms round her, and hold her to his heart ; and they were both in that rather loving situation when the door of the apartment opened, and Mynheer Von Straken, in a chintz dressing-gown and a high peaked night cap upon his head, appeared upon the threshold. It was a very odd thing, and must have arisen entirely from the agitation of mind that the fair Whilelmina was in, hut the fact was, she might have gone easily enough, only that, somehow, her arms bad got entangled round the neck of Wurtem Carlis, and she could not find the way to get them loose again. It was so very provoking, but such was the fact. \" No \u2014 no,\" he added, \" do not go till you have told me that you forgive flie, my own dear, sweet girl !\" \" Wurtem !\" \" Meine Got I\" \" Yes, my dear Wurtem, we will be very happy,\" added Whilelmina. \" My love \u2014 my own\u2014 my beautiful I\" \"We will run away, dear Wurtem.\" \" Yes \u2014 yes, we will, indeed.\" \" And with you I shall be so happy, that I shall do nothing but laugh and sing the whole day long.\" \" Ah, my dear one, I never loved you as I love you now ; and yet I did think that I could not love you better than I did, but I find that I did not then know myself.\" \"And how I iove you, too, Wur tem !\" \" Yes, dear, yes. I listen.\" \"Do you deserve that I should for give you?\" \"No \u2014 no. I do not, I know that I do not ; I fell in my heart that I do not deserve that you should forgive me.\" \"Ihenl \" \"Meine Got !\" cried Von Straken in capitals, and with a voice of thunder. \" Alas !\u2014 Alas !\" \" Will \" \" You will \u2014 you really will ? You really and truly will be so good and kind to me, after all that has passed ? Oh, no, this is some dream ! It is very beautiful, and very full of joy, but it eannot last. It cannot \u2014 cannot last!\" CHAPTER XLV. THE COURSE OF WURTEM'S TRUE LOVB RUNS NOT SMOOTH It was quite impossible that 'either Wurtem Carlis or Whilelmina could be off from now knowing the presence of Mynheer Von Straken. They both started like guilty creatures, as they certainly were not, and Whilelmina darting into the bed again, at once covered herself up with the bed-clothing as she had done before, and all that was heard of her were her smothered sobs at being thus caught by her father in the arms of the very man against whom she might be supposed, after the little scene at the church of St. Nicholas, to feel the greatest degree of hatred and mistrust. He burst into tears, and wept convul sively. Whilelmina was very much affected indeed to see the tears of the only being in the world that she could really give her heart to, and she laid her hand upon his neck, as she cried\u2014 \" Wurtem !\u2014 Wurtem ! \u2014 my own Wurtem ! I do, indeed, I do love you, and I shall always love you ; and I do freely forgive all the past. Do not cry, my dear Wurtem.\" Oh, what words were those for a lover to hear from the lips of her whom he adored ! Oh, what delightful music was that to the ears of such a one as Wurtem Carlis ! If the world had but come to an end just then, what would it have mattered to him ? He had tasted the purest gush of joy that human ex istence was capable of giving to him. Speak to her he could not, for it was quite impossible that the Dutch, or any other language, could contain any words that would be sufficiently expressive of Poor Wurtem had some faint idea that he, too, had better get under the bed-clothes ; but he had the prudence not to attempt it, and turning towards Von Straken, he made him a very ceri monious bow, and said \u2014 \" It is a fine morning !\" \" Ter tefil, Mynheer, what is the morning to me P\""], [158, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 148 \"Nothing, I admit, Mynheer, for even if it should come on to rain, no doubt yoa are provided with an umbrella P\" This was a cool way of ignoring the little circumstance that had just occurred which thoroughly took Straken by sur- prise, and he could only glare at Wur- tem for some few minutes without being able to converge his ideas suffi- ciently to make a suitable reply to him. At length, tearing from his head the conical night- cap. he flung it to the ground, and shouted\u2014 \"Mvnheer, you are one villain, and must light me\" \" No, Mynheer, I will not.\" I \"You will not? Why will you not?\" \"I am afraid \" \" Ah ! wretch ! You do me all the injury in tbe world, and then you are afraid.\" \" Hear me out, Mynheer. I was going to add, that I was.asraid of beating j you, that was all.\" \"That shall not save you, Mynheer; Wurtem Carlis. I will have your life.\" Whilelmina kicked dreadfully beneath the clothes. \" Yes, I will have your life. How long have you been in my bouse, wretch ? j Tell me that. Where and how did you come bere ? Ob, I am a miserable man. I am sick at\u2014 at my stomach\u2014 my ) heart, I mean. My child\u2014 my Whilel- ! , waa\u2014 the light and the apple of my I eye, has brought the name of Straken to aiame. Alas ! alas ! Woe is me\u2014 woe te me ! Where's my pipe ?\" you that I love her, and she is so good and so pure and so beautiful, and that that love is the only joy of my life, you may imagine that it would be a worse blow to me than death to tknk her otherwise.\" The old merchant only groaned lit reply to them. \"Yes, Mynheer,\" added Wurtem, \"she is all that is good as well as all that is beautiful, and I have not been here a quarter of an hour altogether. It was you that I came to see.\" \"Oh\u2014 oh!* The old man did not seem at all able to swallow that assertion. \" Yes, Mynheer, it was you I came to 1 see, and I wanted to tell you that I loved the poor Whilelmina as much as ever, and that I was well to do now in : the world, and bad a good credit at Mynheer Von Rotter, tbe banker, and 1 1 at I was going to purchase a ship of | my own, and send it to the Brazils for j a cargo, and that so I felt that I was. i at last in a position to ask of you the hand of your fair daughter.\" \" Yah ! you don't say so . ls all that true, Whilelmina ?\" She gave a kick beneath the clothe9. \" But, Mynheer Von Wurtem Carlis, how came it that you refused my child at the church of St. Nicholas?\" \"Passion and folly, Mynheer, and jealousy.\" \" Ah ! Three good reasons for any strange act. Well, I am mollified, Mynheer Carlis. Strange things hanpen in mv family, and I don't know now they happen, but they do, and that is enough for me. You must call again some other time, when I will give you an answer to what you say just now.. There is one who \u2014 who \" With these words, Von Straken sunk upon a chair, which give such an omin ous crack under his weight as he did so, that it seemed wonderful it did not alto gether break down with him. Wurtem saw that the first burst of the old mer chant's passion had blown over, and that now was the time to commence an explanation to him of what was the true circumstance of the case. Accord ingly, he said \u2014 \" Mynheer Von Straken, the honour of your child \u2014 the fair \u2014 the lovely .\" * \"Oh, no\u2014 no!\" \" The virtuous \u2014 the most excellent and gentle \" \"Bah! bah!\" \" You allude to the mysterious man-\u00bb\" \" Oh, bush ! hush ! don't allude to him, I beg of you. Now go away, meine young friend, Wurtem Carlis \u2014 go away, and I will speak to my daughter about it all.\" \" Farewell for the present, dear Whilelmina,\" said WTurtem. Upon this, Whilelmina popped her head out from under the clothes, and said, in quite a soft tone \u2014 \" Are you going, indeed ?\" \" I am, dear Whilelmina ; but I will come again as soon as possible, and\" in \" Whilelmina is as dear to me as she can possibly be to you. When I tell"], [159, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 149 the meantime, love, pray remember that \" the means of Jan- Van. There is no occasion in the world why I shonld be intimate with the family of the Rotters. There is that daughter of his, too, who plagued me so. No, I will not go there.\" Here Wurtem stooped so close to the bed, that, somehow, bis lips quite touched tbe cheek of Whilelmina, and there was a particular sound that made the merchant cry out\u2014 \" H illoa, Meine Got, I won't allow any kissing here.\" \" Kissing, Mynheer ?\" said Wurtem. \"I am surprised at you.\" \" And I am astonished,\" said Whil elmina, \"as well as shocked, rather.\" \" But I am sure I heard \" \" Ah ! meine dear, honoured friend,\" cried some one, and in a moment Wur tem found himself clasped in the arms of somebody from behind, to whom, no doubt, the voice belonged. \" Meine excellent Wurtem Carlis, meine dear friend !\" \"Murder! Who are you?\" \" What ! Do you not know the voice of your own friend, Von Rotter ?\" \" Oh, is it you, Mynheer i\" \" It is, to be sure. How delighted I am to have met with you. But come on \u2014 it is breakfast time. \"Oh, no, Mynheer\u2014 oh, no.\" \"Certainly not, father; you are dreaming. I can only wonder how you could cast such a reflection upon your child, you who ought to be the first to uphold her, and to say a word for her. Oh, father, I am truly surprised at you.\" Upon this, the fair Whilelmina began to weep at such a desperate rate, that, for the sake of peace, the old man was obliged to say that it was very likely he was mistaken ; and then he bustled Wurtem Carlis away, who left the house very well pleased with the result of his visit to it. \"But, Mynheer \" \" Well\u2014 well, you can say all (hat you want to say to me at the breakfast, you know. But come on. We are always delighted to ses you, you know, and we were quite wondering where you were.\" \"But Mynheer \" \" Nay, I will not hear you in the open streets. Of course, you and I have many Uttle private matters to talk of now, that we don't want all the world to know, so come along at once. The little banker hooked himself on to Wurtem Carlis in such a manner that, without absolute roughness to him, it would have been quite impossible to shake him off, and that was what the kind heart of Wurtem would not let him do to one who had been in his way kind to him ; so he felt himself, in a way of speaking, compelled against his will to accompany the banker to his home, although he had rather a vague horror of doing so upon that occasion, and some thing seemed to whisper to him that it would be very far from good to him to \" She will still be mine,\" he said. \" She loves me ! Of that I cannot now entertain a doubt. She will never be another's,'; shejias seen that she will not, and now I feel that I have nothing to do but to be happy, for all the world seems to smile upon me. I will do as have said, purchase a ship of my own and send it to the Brazils for a cargo, and then with the produce of that I will buy another ship, and with the produce of these two I will buy two more ships.

Youth is indeed the time in which to build castles in the air. The house was close at hand, however, so that poor Wurtem was within the door before he could think of any reasonable and effectual mode of escaping, and then it was too late. Pleasinghis imagination in this fashion, Wurtem walked rapidly on until he found himself in the immediate neigh bourhood of the banking-house of Myn heer Von Rotter, and then he paused. \" No\u2014 no,\" he said. \" I will not go there. It is sufficient that I have a good account open at the house, through \" Now,1' cried the banker, \" bustle \u2014 bustle, all of yon.

We must leave Wurtem Carlis for a brief space to tbe care of his good genius, while we now relate rather a startling adventure that befell Tom Simpson and Co., after he had left Wurtem Carlis in the street. Poor Simpson was so harassed by everything that had taken place, and so thoroughly convinced, now, that every thing in the shape of a commercial and matrimonial union of the two houses of Simpson and Straken was now out of the question, that he had serious thoughts, as he said, of consigning him self to London forthwith. \" Only a few hours since we parted.\" \" Ah, indeed. 1 am so glad to hear that \u2014 so very glad. You are an excel lent young man, and Jan- Van is one of the best men in all the world. If I could only be honoured now and then as you are. Mynheer Von Carlis, by his com pany, I should be most happy.\" \" And I should like vastly to know who he is,\" thought Wurtem, \" only I don't like to confess my own ignorance so far, as to ask such a question of Van Rotter.\" \" What's the use of my staying here ?\" he soliloquised. \" The girl won't have me, that's quite clear, and the old man is half- cracked, I do believe. I can't make out whether he is well off or not There seems to be something queer in his affairs at times, and then they seem all right again. I'll go back, that I will ; and as 1 happen to know there's a ship bound for Southampton lying out side the quays, I'll go in her, if 1 can.\" With this view, Tom Simpson went to tbe quays and made all inquiry about the ship, which he found was duly freighted for the English port of South ampton, and was going off with the turn of the tide. Dp, then, he went to the Stadtholder Hotel, so well known on the West-quay at Amsterdam, and having partaken of some refreshment, he penned the following letter to Myn heer Von Straken \u2014 Wurtem was conducted into the very best room of the house, and in a very short time, considering that the esta blishment was a Dutch one, and that the servants were in the habit of taking things easy, a capital breakfast was laid; indeed, it might be called a magnificent breaklast, and, to tell the truth, Wur tem's appetite yearned towards it ; and if he could have done so with perfect ease and politeness, he would not at that moment have felt it to be possible to leave the hospitable board of Myn - heer Von Rotter. \"Do not wait, Mynheer,\" said Von Rotter. \" Do not wait. She whom we both love, my fair and excellent child, will soon be here.\" \u00ab* To Mynheer Von Strakea. \" Sir,\u2014 Having come to Amsterdam, per order, properly consigned and ac credited, to marry Miss Whilelmina Straken, would have duly honoured ac ceptance of hand, but found article not up to sample.

Simpson and Co.\" \" The devil she will !\" thought Wur tem. \" Ah, you do not know one-balf the excellences of that admirable being,\" added Von Rotter, who was so over come by his feelings, that he pushed a tear out of his eye with the handle of a fork. \" When she goes from me into the arms of another, I shall be \u2014 Oh ! here she is.\" The door opened, and the banker's daughter made her appearance. \" I rather think that will settle the whole business,\" said Tom Simpson. \" He can't say that I have acted shabbily"], [161, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 151 and gone off without letting him know, and it will stand much better in New gate Street, for me to say I declined carrying out the transaction, than that they wouldn't have me.\" By this it will be seen, that, after all, Tom Simpson was rather cunning than not, aud he thought so himself, evidently, by the manner in which he placed his finger by the side of his nose at times as he finished the above pre cious epistle. \"They call me a fool,\" said Tom Simpson, \" but I ain't such a fool as 1 look. No\u2014 no. Not a bit of it.\" \" The devil !\" said Tom. \" No,\" said Vanderdecken, in his calm, quiet way. \" No ! Why should you think that of me, Mr. Thomas Simpson, of Newgate Street, in the City of London ?\" \"Oh,\" said Tom, \"you know me, I see, well enough ; but I don't want to have anything to say to you, old fellow ; so good evening. It strikes me that you and old Straken get on pretty well together, and I dou't want to inter fere.\" '\u25a0' You cannot suppose,\" said Vander decken, as he looked at Tom Simpson with his cold, icy eye. \" You cannot suppose that I came to you without a purpose, and neither can you suppose that I will go again without executing it.\" After this, Tom pitched in, as he himself called it, to rather a good break fast, and, to tell the truth, looked as little like a disappointed lover as possi ble. To be sure, we ought not, in such a personage as Tom Simpson, to look for any of the finer feelings of human nature. We must look for his thoughts and opinions to the manner in which he had been educated. \" Oh, but I \u2014 I am rather busy, you see, Mr. Diderich ; so, you see\u2014\" \"Go on, I will hear you; but after that, you will hear me.\" \" Well, but I can't. I am going to leave Holland.\" Tom's father was what in London is called a business man, which means, a man who will stoop to any meanness, or practise any dishonesty or villany, and sacrifice every seeling to money- making. Tom had been brought up to consider the business in which he and his father were engaged as the most important affair under the sun, and he firmly be lieved that everybody was just more or less useful, inasmuch as they aided in the prosecution of that business, while any one who in any manner was or was likely to be a hinderance, was considered positively criminal. In fact, such were the opinions of the elder Simpson, and they had been carefully installed into the small mind of the younger, along with the multiplication-table ; and the thorough heartless selfishness that cha racterises your true London man of business, was sure to find in Tom a worthy imitator and follower. \" Now,\" he said, \" I'll just go down to the quay and see if I can't make a bargain about my passage,\" \" Mynheer Diderich !\" announced one of the waiters of the hotel, flinging the door wide open suddenly. \" Who ?\" cried Tom Simpson. The figure of Vanderdecken appeared upon the threshold of the room, and the waiter closed the door. \" I know it. In the good ship, Mary- Jane, lying off the quay. I know it, but still you must hear me. Would a consignment of indigo and Brazil wood, of the finest quality, at a reduc tion of eighty per cent, off the current market price, suit your house?\" \" I believe you !\" cried Tom. \" Wouldn't it.\" \" Would information where to pitch upon eight hundred barrels, of one hun dredweight each, of gold-dust, be likely to be useful ?\" Tom actually gasped again. \" Would positive data by which you could fall in with a chest of pearls of about the estimated value of one million and a half of English money, be at all in your way V Tom slid off his chair, and sat on the floor, as he said\u2014 \" Oh, gracious, you don't mean that, Mr. What-do-you-call-em ?'' \" I do.\" \" Well, then, never mind the indigo and the Brazil wood. _'_'c will be down upon the pearls and the gold-dust. But you don't mean eight hundred barrels, do you ?\" \" I do.

Then how are they to be got at ?\" \" As easy as that,\" said Vander decken, as he stretched out his hand. \" But I don't bring you theae advantages for nothing.\" , it, that I do know it, and that my knowledge does not end there only. So, now, the good ship Mary-Jane will sail in an hour. We had better go on board at once.\" \"Very good. I \u2014 that is, of course, I am very glad to have you with me as you are so well off. Two millions, I think you said?\" \"I did.\" \" Oh, no \u2014 I\u2014 that is, the old man\u2014 my father, I mean, will give you some thing for yourself, of course.\" \" Well, of course, we are always glad to see any one who is well off, whether we get anything from them or not. The fact that they are well off goes a great way with us, you see, sir. Not that we are at all selfish, or anything of that sort ; but/you know, it is so comfortable to know only people who are well to do, ain't it, now ?\" \" Indeed ? I would not trust him, Tom Simpson.\" \"What, not trust the old man? I can tell you, we always meet our bills clown on the nail, as soon as due.\" \" You would find yourselves in the Gazette if you did not. But that is not the question, my friend, for I may, I hope, call you such. I think of going to England, and, before I go, be you so good as to answer me one question : Do you think that a man with about a couple of millions of money, could get a wife in England ?\" \"Oh, very. But come, we lose time- Recollect, you are to help me all you can to an English wife, and I am to prop up the failing credit of the house of Tom Simpson and Co., or else it will go. You came here with the hope that this alliance with Straken would bolster up your credit in the London markets, aud so it would ; but that has gone off, as you see.\" \"The devil could with half the amount.\" \" Good. Then I shall go with you in the Mary-Jane, Mynheer\" Tom Simp sod, and as we proceed I will tell you more particulars about the treasures I have mentioned to you. You will in troduce me to your father in London, and he and you both will take care to introduce me to society, as a gentleman with so much money, and I will take care that the whole affair shall be worth your while. You have some rather heavy acceptances to meet in August next.\" \"Why, yes, it has, rather.\" \" And 1 will stand in the place of such an arrangement : I will see that, no harm comes to your credit, so long as you act by me with sincerity and fairness.\" \" Well, then, sir, I can only tell you that if you come to England and just so much as whisper that you want a wife and have got money, you will have mothers and al) the old maids flying down your throat, almost.\" Vanderdecken shook his head. . \" The deuce ! So we have.\" \" And that stock of muscovado sugar don't go off quite so well as you would wish. Some of it is rather damaged, you know.

We return lo our friend, Wurtem Carlis, who was breakfasting at Myn heer Von Rotter's at the moment that the rather dubious daughter of that podgy individual entered the apartment. Now, Wurtem was so very ungallant, I \u00abe far as the fair Truchden was con cerned, that he would rather have been anywhere than just where he was at the moment she made her appearance ; and although noise enough had been made about the arrival of Wurtem Carlis and his breakfasting there to iufonn the whole street of the fact, one might imagine that Truchden did not know it, by the look of surprise that came over her face upon seeing the young man seated at her father's hos pitable board. We do not mean positively to assert that this was a piece of acting upon the part of the fair Truchden \u2014 the reader must draw his own conclusion upon tthat head from what he happens to know, through the medium of this veritable history, of Truchden, and of her worthy and exemplary papa. \" Oh, is this possible P\" cried Truch- den, when she saw Wurtem Carlis sip- ping his chocolate. \" Is this a dream ? or is it a \u2014 a \u2014 not a dream ?\" efforts not to laugh, that he very nearly choked himself ; but after kicking a little he recovered ; and then he shook his head reproachfully at Truchden, as he said \u2014 \" Ab, you beautiful child, you have airthe wit of your poor departed mother, and all the genius of your father.\" \"A capital combination,\" said Wur tem. \" Meine child,\" said old Von Rotter, with a gracious wave of his little fat arm, that looked like the fin of some great turtle\u2014 \" meine child, sit down. \" Yes, Mynheer Carlis, it is ; I have a genius, though I say it who sliould not ; and I assure you, Mynheer Carlis,"], [165, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 155 that when I was only twelve years of age, I was able to count up twenty-four rows of figures without making the least mistake, and I rather think that all the world over that would be consi dered genius.\" Rotter ; so I will now take my leave of you, if you please.\" \" Oh dear \u2014 oh dear !\" said Truchden. \" Oh, my poor heart \u2014 my poor heart 1\" \"As you please,\" said Mynheer Von Rotter, sitting down again. \" I will not leave you, since you are so good as to prefer my poor company to my absence.

When she was quite a little thing she was as active, meine Got, as an eel, and used to get through a hoop all manner of ways, and do such wonderful things, that, meine Got, it was quite a treat to see her.\" \" You don't say ?\" said Wurtem. \" Yes I do. Truchden, meine love ?\" \" Yes, father.\" \" Do you think you could get through the hoop now for the entertainment of our good friend, Wurtem Carlis ?\" \"No,\" said Truchden, mher snap pishly, \" I could not. How could you ask me to do such a thing ?\" \" It would be very droll,\" said Wur tem. \" And so did I,\" sighed Truchden. \"Well,\" said Wurtem, coldly, \"that is mybusiness, I believe.\" \"Entirely,\" said Von Rotter. \" Oh, yes,\" said Truchden ; \" who can doubt that, Mynheer Wurtem Carlis ? Of course, Whilelmina will now retire from Amsterdam, and hide herself from all the world for ever ?* \"Why so?\" \" Can you ask me ? Is it not dread ful for a young girl to go to church to be married, and then to come home unmarried ? Ab, me, I should kill my self, and go to my long home at once.\" \" It would not be a very long one,\" thought Wurtem, \" considering that your total height is not above four feet. Allow me to say,\" he then added aloud, \"that I would rather have nothing to say about Whilelmina Strakrn. It is not well to discuss the merits of absent friends.\" \"Ah,\" sighed Truchden, \"for you, Mynheer Carlis, I might even be per suaded npon to get through a hoop.\" \" I beg you won't think of it. In deed, the process would be quite the other way, and you will greatly oblige me by leaving it alone.\" \" Anything for you,\" said Truchden. \" Well \u2014 well, meine children,\" said old Von Rotter, rising, \" I will leave you to bill and coo like two turtle-doves\u2014 ah, meine Got, yes, like two turtle doves \u2014 ah, while I attend to meine books below, and see that no one is cheating the great firm of Von Rotter & Co.\u2014 ah!\" \" Oh, how kind and good,\" said Truchden, \" how very kind and good it is of you, Wurtem Carlis, to speak so, even of her. Well \u2014 well, there is much happiness in store for us yet, I hope.\" \"I hope there is, for all who deserve it,\" said Wurtem Carlis, coldly, for he detected the double meaning of fair Truchden's words, and gave that young lady credit for a considerable amount of artful diplomacy. Von Rotter, during the last few minutes, had knocked upon the floor repeatedly with his heel, and then he said \u2014 \" Mynheer,\" said Wurtem, rising, \" I hope you will do no such thing\u2014 no such thing !\" \"No, mynheer, I should be very sorry to trouble the fair Truchden with my company \u2014 very sorry, indeed, for I am quite sure we should not be at all amusing to each other, Mynheer Von"], [166, "156 VANDERDECKEN; OR, resist her advances, and be quite polite at the same time. \"Mynheer Von Carlis, I have some thing particular to say to you, if you please, before you go. It is upon an affair of great moment, and I will say it at once \u2014 yes, at once I will say it \u2014 here, at once.\" Von Rotter was evidently waiting for something ; and when the door of the room was opened, and one of the clerks said\u2014\" Mynheer is wanted below for a few moments,\" Wurtem saw that that was what the banker waited for, as he immediately rose. \" I won't speak to her,\" thought Wur tem, \"and old Rotter must be back soon ; I won't speak a word to her.\" Truchden was not so easily to be put off as all that, though, for after looking at him a few minutes through her little fat singers in tbe way we have men tioned, she said\u2014 \"Ah, Wurtem, here we are alone again.\" \" Ah,\" said Wurtem. : \" And nobody to interfere with ns. 1 know that a scandalous attempt was made in the church of St. Nicholas to induce you to marry Whilelmina ; but you thought of me, and it failed.\" \"Oh, stuff!\" said Wurtem. '\u25a0 Yes, it was stuff, indeed. But, my love, you don't look quite so well to day. Does the dear head ache\u2014 or is the dear mind affected in any way ? Tell its Truchden, do.\" Wurtem looked at her in amazement. Wurtem rose likewise, but Von Rotter curved his brows and slightly smiled, as he said \u2014 \" Is the gallant and brave Wurtem Carlis afraid to be left alone even fora few moments with a young lady ?\" Wurtem dropped into his seat again. It ceitainly did look like gross cow ardice, besides being rather an ungen tlemanly thing to desert Truchden in so marked a manner. \" Mynheer Von Rotter,\" he said, \"I have various engagements ; but as you say you have something of impor tance to say to me, I hope you will return aud say it as soon as possible.\" \" I shall not be half a minute. They only want my signature to some docu ment, I daresay.\" The banker left the room, and then when Wurtem turned to the fair Truchden he found that she had both her hands over her faee, and that she was peeping at him between her fingers. Wurtem felt vexed and fidgetty. He was one moment inclined to swear a little, and another to laugh, for his eyes were wide open to the fact that the great Von Rotter and the fair Truchden were prepared to stir Heaven and earth, and the other place beside, which is not usually mentioned in polite circles, to inveigle him by force or fraud into the chains of matrimony, with Truchden for a partner ; and it seemed to him so mon strously ridiculous that they could imagine for one moment he was capable of being deceived, cajoled, or bullied into a union, that, when he took that view of the subject, ne was tempted to laugh outright. But still the affair was vexatious, for Wurtem was not the sort of person to behave with anything like rudeness or discourtesy even to Truch den, and he felt how difficult it was to \" Well,\" he said, \" this is rich !\" \" Ah, yes,\" she replied, \" we shall be rich, indeed. How could I refuse or play the coy maiden to one who was ap proved of by my father, and who was the friend of Jan- Van ?\" \"Oh, indeed?\" said Wurtem. \"No. Others have sighed at my feet \u2014 others have wooed me, but I would not listen to them. I preserved my virgin heart for my Wurtem, and he has it in his holy keeping.\" \"Well, this is pleasant,\" thought Wurtem. \" I tell you what it is. Miss Truohden, you are mistaken.'' \"Oh, no\u2014 no. The head may be mistaken, but the heart \u2014 never ! Edu cation makes the head, but the heart is nature, and she is perfect in all her works, from the little road-side flower to the noble sentiments of exalted hu manity.\" \"The deuce take the little tLing,\" thought Wurtem. \"She is no fool either. Where could she have picked up such ideas as those ?' Wurtem did not know that the fair Truchden had picked those words out of a novel the day before, and bad learnt them by heart, with but a very dim idea of what they meant ; but still, Truchden had a tolerable intellect, or she could"], [167, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 157 The door was flung open at this moment, and old Von Rotter appeared, with a troop of people at his heels, and he cried out\u2014 \"Ah \u2014 ah, meine children!

Do you wish to be my ruin ?\" . \"I don't care whether you are ruined or not,\" said Wurtem, for he was losing all patience, \" so that you get out of my way.\" CHAPTER XLIX. WURTEM CARLIS ESCAPES THE MACHI- NATIONS OF VON ROTTER. The amazement and the indignation \u2014 for he did feel indignant as well as amazed \u2014 of Wurtem Carlis at all these proceedings was so great, that there he sat, with the fair Trucuden's arms round his neck, unable to move ; but she, when she found that every one had seen in what a loving position they were, re- moved the little arms from around his, and affecting to be very much shocked, indeed, retired to the farther end of the room, and began crying in so violent a way, that it was enough to deceive any- body. \" Don't cry, meine child,\" said Von ; Rotter \u2014 \" don't cry.

I beg, now, to tell you all quite distinctly, that if you have come here with the expectation of forcing me into a marriage with Truch den, you will be mistaken.\" \" My son,\" said the priest, recover ing himself sufficiently to speak, \"allow me to say that I can be no party to forcing any one into a marriage, nor do I think that any one here would do such a thing.\" \"Oh, no \u2014 no !\" cried everybody. \" You may have alteied your mind,\" added the priest, \" and if so, it is quite out of the question that all the world san make you mairy the lady.\" \" Yes,\" said Von Rotter. \" Oh, yes, that's it. He comes here and he makes love to my child \u2014 he wins the heart of my beautiful Truchden, who has refused all sorts of offers \u2014 he fascinates my only child, and then he, at the last mo ment, after saying he will marry her, and getting my consent, and inducing me to call together my friends, and to send for you, reverend sir, says that he has altered his mind.\" \"Ob, yes \u2014 yes!\" said everjboay; \" no doubt of that.\" \" My son,\" said the clergyman, with a bland look \u2014 \" my son, we will per form the ceremony which is to make you the happy husband of yonder young lady at once, now. 1 can easily imagine the state of impatience you must be in to be able, with the sanction of the ohurch, to call her yours.\" \" Can you \u2014 \" gasped out Wurtem\u2014 \"can you \u2014 \" \" Oh, ye3, we all can !\" said every body at once. Wurtem rose, and looked Von Rotter, and the clergyman, and the guests, in the face ; and then, in a slow and dis tinct voice, he said \u2014 \" So, you think by this nonsense, which is as base as it is ridiculous, that I am to be forced into a marriage with that little bundle of treachery and deceit yonder, who but too ably seconds her o'd rascal of a father in his plans and projects ?\" The guests, and the parson, and Von Rotter himself, all fell back a pace or two at this dreadful speech from Wur tem Carlis, and Truchden gathered up her little feet on to the couch where she had gone and hid her face, and affected to cry in a desperate way. She, no doubt, felt that she had done all ihat she could in the matter, and that if it was to be brought now to a successful conclusion, it must be by other hands than hers. \" Excuse me,\" said Wurtem. \" I never said anything of the sort.\" \" Oh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh !\" cried everybody. \" No,\" added Wurtem, \" I never said anything of the sort.\" \"Then'marry her!\" cried everybody in a breath. INow, to give the clergyman his due, it is but fair to say that he was no party to the projects and schemes of the great Von Rotter ; but, in the pure and common discharge of his duty, he had come, upon being summoned to do so, to perform a marriage ceremony at the house of the banker ; and when he saw Truchden perched up upon the lap of Wurtem Carlis, and with her little arms round his neck, the good pastor thought naturally enough that the sooner the ceremony was performed between such a loving couple the better it would be for all parlies. The speech of Wurtem Carlis, though, struck him dumb with amazement, and he looked from one to another for an explanation, without being able to get any at all of a satisfactory nature. \" Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear !\" said Von \" Nor will I marry her.\" \" This is, I am afraid, a very bad young man,\" said the priest. \" I must confess that his conduct strikes me as being very reprehensible indeed. Oh, a very bad young man, indeed. I am grieved to see one so young so aban doned and so little sensible even to shame. It is dreadful.\" \" Shocking !\" cried all the rest. \"And it will kill me,\" said Von Rotter. \" And break my virgin heart,\" said Truchden, kicking dreadfully. \"Vfirygood,\" said Wurtem Carli?. \" Whatever doleful effects my conduct"], [169, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 159 may produce, I shall persevere with it. The fact is, that I never made love to the lady\u2014 I never followed her about\u2014 I never thought about her at all \u2014 I never offered to marry her, and I won't.\" \" He is a monster,\" added Truchden, \" a faithless monster.\" The ladies all intimated that that was just what he was, and no mistake at all about it ; and she perplexed clergyman looked from one to the other in amaze ment, not uomixed with some degree of terror. Von Rotter sunk into a chair, and the priest held up his hands in despair, while consternation sat upon the coun tenances of the guests. \" Young man \u2014 young man,\" said the priest, \"as an answer to all you have asserted, let me ask you if when we all came into this room, Truchden Rotter was not in your arms ?\" \" Ah, ask him that 1\" cried the guests. \" Now,\" added Wurtem, \" as I have explained this matter, in justice to myself I beg to say, that I will never enter this house again.\" \" He is going !\" said Truchden. \" Let him go,\" said Von Rotter . \" There is law in Amsterdam, and I will call upon it to aid me in seeing justice done to my child, who is as pnre as she is fair.\" \" Ask\u2014 him\u2014 that,\" sobbed Von Rotter, \"ask him that.\" \"Then I reply, no,\" said Wurtem; \" and but for the reverence, sir, in which I hold your sacred calling, I would not remain here another moment to answer at all ; but I do not think that you are in this plot.\" \" Plot ?\" said the. priest. \" Ay, reverend sir \u2014 plot. It is a plot to make me marry Truchden, or, falling that, I suppose, to induce ttieb -iiet that I ought to have married her. 1 say, sir, to yon, and 1 say to all here, that Truchden was not in my arms.\" \" We saw her \u2014 we saw her !\" \"Very good,\" said Wurtem, \" that is just wmt t expected,\" and he moved towards the door. \" Do you call yourself a man ?\" cried one of the ladies, interrupting him. \"Yes, madam.\" \" Then why don't you marry the girl, sir, at once ? What so easy as to marry the girl at once ?\" \" Nothing so easy, madam, provided I had the inclination so to do, which I beg to assure you I have not. Good day to you, Mynheer Von Rotter. I acknowledge that yo i managed this little affair very well ; but, you see, it is a failure. Good-day to you, too, Truch den ; you are a very clever girl, and I fully admit that you have played your part to perfection ; but, still, it is a failure. Good-day to you, ladies and gentlemen; it it is quite impossible for me to classify you, and to say which are (he duped and which are those who came to dupe ; but I have the pleasure of bidding you all good-day.\" With these words, Wurtem left the room, and hurrying down the stairs, was out of the banker's house in a very snort time, indeed, fully resolved upon never setting foot in it again. This explosion at the bCSs's, for it might be called such, had thb \u00ab\u00a3&ct of rather altering the course of Ws^'f speculations concerning the futu'.o. & the first place, he resolved that he woa-ffa not accept one farthing more from the banker than he was justified in taking upon the order for money that had been given him by Jan-Van. To be sure, that mysterious personage had told liiin \" No, ladies, you saw me in the arms of Truchden, and most unwillingly did I remain there ; but she was not in my arms.\" This declaration produced such a shout of indignation from the ladies, that for some few minutes, as every one of them spoke in a breath, it was quite impos sible to hear any one, so that, although it looked .like it, no time in reality was saved at all by the arrangement. And now Truchden herself thought that she might say something to advan tage, and, looking up from the couch, upon which she had been lying, she cried out \u2014 \" Oh \u2014 oh, do I look like one who would go to the arms of any man? Is it likely that any lady would hold any individual in her arms? Is it probable, I say? Are we all so bad in Holland that we do such things ? Is tbe female character to be traduced ?\" \" No ! Perish the thought !\" cried all the ladies."], [170, "VANDERDECKEN. 160 to exact, if he chose, a price from Von Rotter for the promise of the contract which that individual wanted, and which he\u2014 Wurtem\u2014 now fully understood was the contract for the repairs of the dams, and water-courses, and embank ments of the city ; so that, if he chose, no doubt he might make a good bar gain. - \" But then,\" said Wurtem Carlis to himself, \"what an empty and a hollow thing, after all, this promise is. I do not know who gives it. This Jaa-Van to me is as mysterious as ever, and he has disappeared from me like a shadow, so that I really never expect to see him again. How can I go to Von Rotter and aek him for a sum of money for an advantage that I have no possible means o' assuring him of?\" Wurtem Carlis walked along rapidly to allay the perturbation of bis spirits ; but he\" little heeded which way he went, and it was chance only that brought him opposite to the house of Von Slraken, where resided all that he really loved \u2014 for the periis, and the dangers, and the difficulties that seemed to surround his hopes of a union with Whilelmina only served more and more to make him cling to the idea of some day making her his own. \" Wurtem really loved her. \"Ah !\" he said, as ho looked up at the well-remembered house ; \" there she is \u2014 the idol of my heart \u2014 there she is, my beautiful Whilelmina, who is, alter all, as superior to Truchden as day is to night.\" Alter he had made this confession, favourable as it was to Whilelmina, Wurtem Carlis was quite angry with himself for naming Truchden at all in the same breath with her, and wondered at himself for bestowing a moment's thought upon the little deceiver. \"twill banish her from my mind,\" he said, \" and turn all my thoughts to you, my Whilelmina. Ah ! would that I were with you now, dear one. Then, indeed, in your sweet and delightful society, I should find a solace from every woe. I will yet cherish the dream of happiness with you that has ever been so dear to my heart.\" \u00ae As Wurtem began, now, to think over the past, he recollected that his last interview with Von Straken was by no means a satisfactory one, although nothing definite was arrived at. Yet tbe old merchant had told him he might call again, and that was something. \" He did not forbid me the house, at all events,\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"and that was something, I have a good mind to call, now.\" As Wuitem thus uttered his \"good mind,\" the window of Whilelmina's chamber opened, and a hand with a tulip was projected. Well did he know that the hand could belong to no other than Whilelmina. The tulip was dropped into the street, and with a wild rush to snatch it up, Wurtem Carlis ran across the way, and, unfortunately, Mynheer Von Straken coming out of his house at the moment at rather more speed than was at all usual with him, they ran against each other with a force that sent Von Straken backwards into,' the passage of the house again, and nearly upset Wur tem. The advantage which Wurtem, who was about half the weight of Von Straken, enjoyed in this concussion, was owing to that well-known law of motions, which enables the body moving with the greater velocity to get the better of the body moving with the lesser speed. If Von Straken had been going at the speed of Wurtem, and Wurtem at that of Straken, the poor young lover would have been demolished to a certainty. \"- Meine Got! what's that?\" cried Von Straken. \" The deuce ! where is the tulip ?\" said Wurtem. There it lay, smashed as flat as it was possible for any tulip to be, for the merchant had had his foot upon it. Still Wurtem picked it up, and ap proached the prostrate merchant. \" My dear sir,\" he said, \" how sorry and unhappy I am to have been the c .use of this little accident to you I\" \" Meine Got !\" \"Let me help you up, Mynheer Von Straken, and inquire how your lovely and accomplished daughter is now.\" \" Ah !\" With some difficulty Wurtem got Von Straken on his legs again, and then the old merchant shook his head as he said\u2014"], [171, "VANDERDKCKEN.

Now, the Mary-Jane, as the ship was called in which they bad managed to secure a passage, was a stout, square rigged vessel of English build, and con sidered one of the most sea-worthy that her owners possessed, and they were very large ship owners, indeed, and traded to all parts of the world very largely. Tlie ship had a capital character for standing any weather, and insurances were effected upon her with ease, both in London and in Amsterdam. Her captain was a man of experience and ability, and ever reached post-safe ; so that there seemed to be every possible likelihood of the Mary-Jane reaching Southampton in safety. But, as Shyloek says-\u2014 \u2022 This was easier to say than to do, for the idea of anybody getting their arms round Von Straken was perfectly absurd. Nevertheless, in the joy of his heart Wurtem Carlis tried it. \" Meine Got !\" cried Von Straken, \" I shouldn't mind a bit, if I felt quite sure about that \u2014 that\u2014\u2014\" \" Diderich ?\" said Wurtem. \"Ah \u2014 yes. Let that be his name. But come, meine good young friend, you must come and speak to Whilelmina ; and if fate will have it that you are to be my son-in-law, why, fate must make everything agreeable accordingly ; so come along, and think nothing of the past.\" Wurtem Carlis was quite willing to let the past sink into oblivion now that Von Straken spoke to him so like a rea sonable man, as he considered it. To be sure, the conduct of the merchant had not been altogether characterised by any great devotion or generosity ; but then, we must consider the very unprece dented circumstances in which he was placed, and that human nature is, after all, prone to be selfish. \" Ships are but wood \u2014 sailors but men ;\" and so, after all, we shall, perhaps, see that affairs did not go on quite so plausibly on board the Mary-Jane as might have been wished. But we will not anticipate. The little round house, or cabin, in which Tom Simpson and Vanderdecken, under his assumed name of Thompson, sat down was about twice the size of an ordinary cupboard ; but that on board ship was considered rather considerable. There was now, as the vessel stemmed the tide more and more, rather a brisk breeze blowing off shore, which sent her through the water pleasantly and steadily, so that Tom Simpson began to think that he was quite a sailor, and need have no apprehension on the score of sea-sickness \u2014 a malady which usually had the barbarity to attack him, even if he went to the More ; and a voyage to Margate completely laid him, to use a nautical expression, upon his beam ends.' CHAPTBR L. F0LL0W3 THE FORTUNES OF VANDER- DECKEN AT SEA WITH TOM SIMP- SON. The trip to Holland had been per formed by Tom Simpson, as he said, standing on his head all the way in one of the state berths. We are glad to leave our friend, Wurtem Carlis, with such a prospect of happiness before him, although we are rather afraid still, that it may be removed by some of those cross accidents whicb beset true love. We will not, however, anticipate evil of any sort, if we can possibly avoid doing so. \" Upon my life,\" said Tom Simpson, as he looked through one of the little casements of the round house \u2014 \" upon my life, Mr. a\u2014 a\u2014 Thompson, 1 begin to think that I shall like the sea very much.\" We now turn our attention to the proceedings of Vanderdecken and Tom \"Ah!\" said Vanderdecken."], [173, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 163 \"I don't seel at all queer. \u2014 Do at this moment. \" Fine weather for us just now.

It will be rather an aggravation to my governor to find that things haven't go on all right at the firm of Von Straken & Co., but it can't be helped ; for if that fat piece of goods, Whilelmina, wouldn't have me, why, what could I do ?\" \" Nothing.\" \" That's exactly my opinion, do you know. I came to that opinion after a good deal of thought about the matter ; and so, you see, I have done nothing but just made up my mind to march off in the very nick of time for you, haven't I?\" \" Well,\" said Tom Simpson, with an air of great satisfaction, \" they belong to my friend, here, Mr. Thompson, you see, a highly respectable gentleman, who is going with me to London for a wife.'' The captain laughed as she said \u2014 \" He needn't want a wife long, if he carries such pearls as those about him. I rather think they are the sort of things to dazzle the eyes of the ladies.\" \" I believe you,\" said Tom Simpson. \" You are a very sensible man, captain.\" \" Much obliged to you, sir,\" replied the captain, and he was about to leave the round-house, when Vanderdecken said, in a low, soft voice\u2014 \" Have you many passengers, sir ?\" \" Only three, besides you two gentle men. There is a gentleman in not very good health, and a young lady, and there is likewise a widow lady, who I don't think will be often on deck.

It's a secret, but \u2014 \" here Tom Simpson leant over close to Mr. Holford, and said \u2014 \" I do believe he's worth a couple of millions.\" \" Indeed ?\" The state cabin of the Mary-Jane, in which there could be accommodated, as well as people were ever accommodated on ship-board, about a dozen passengers, was rather tastily fitted up, although when Tom Simpson and Vanderdecken entered it, it was rather dark. The latter went to an obscure corner and sat down, but Tom Simpson, with nis usual conceit and garrulity, was resolved upon saying something to the other passen gers, and particularly to the young lady. To his great disappointment, though, she was not there. Upon a coach at one end of the state cabin, and occupying within a very little of the whole width and length of it, sat the widow lady, who had been men tioned by the captain. She had rather an odd look about her, owing to a habit of looking with great rapidity all round her circle of vision, as though she were continually upon the look out for some thing extraordinary ; and the way in which she breathed, too, imparted rather a painful expression to the lower part of her face. Nothing would serve this lady but she must keep her lips as closely shut as though her life depended upon doing so, and breathe with diffi culty through rather a snub nose, that nature had never intended should do one-half so much work. \"Yes. What do you think of that?\" \" That the gentleman is a very rich personage ; but I'm sorry you told me if it be a secret, my good sir.\" \" Ob, don't mention that. I'm sure you won't let it go any further \u2014 I know you won't, because, perhaps, he wouldn't like it, you know. Well, ma'am, how do you do ?\" \" Go away,\" said the fat lady, \" go away. Oh, dear \u2014 ob, dear, my bead \u2014 my head \u2014 Go away, puppy. Oh\u2014 oh !\" \"Lor, ma'am, I'm sorry to see that you are so bad.\" \" No, you ain't. Go away !\" \" Ob, very good, ma'am. Only let me advise a little cold brandy-and-water, ma'am. It's the only thing that ever does me any good if 1 feel a little queer. But you don't mean to say that you are sea-sick already ?\" \" Yes, I am,\" said the lady, in a more amicable tone of voice, for probably she felt a little mollified at hearing Tom Simpson talk of cold brandy-and-water. \" Yes, I always get sea-sick from the moment that 1 make up my mind to go on board a vessel ; and from the moment that I do go on board it, I just set in this kind of way, as you see me now. Ob, dear \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear, what a rumbling !\" This lady's name was Mrs. Bell. Then not far from her sat the old gentleman who was in not very good health. He was a small, mild looking old man, with gray hair, and a look of settled pain and nervousness upon his face, no doubt the result of long con tinned indisposition. The gentleman's name was Holford, and we may state at once that the young lady who was likewise on board, but who was then in her own cabin, which was a little cupboard off the state cabin, was Flora Holford, his daughter. All the party were English, then, with the exception of Vanderdecken. Tom Simpson was resolved to be"], [175, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 165 \" I don't hear it, ma'am.\" \" How should you ? It ain't in your inside, I suppose ?\" \" Oh, that's it. Well, all I can say her in the way of description, and we think that that ought to be enough. Tom Simpson was evidently wonder fully struck by the beauty of Flora, and he continued staring at her until she noticed it, and wouldn't look his way any more ; and then the steward brought in a tray with a luncheon upon it, and Tom Simpson caught up a plate with some pastry, and, fully intending t,o;hand it to Miss Flora, he stepped across the cabin, but the good ship, Mary-Jane, at that moment gave a lurch, and over went Tom Simpson and all the plate of pastry right into the lap of Mrs. Bell. \" Go away. Oh, dear, don't speak to me\u2014 go away, now, that's a good man, or I shall Jbe cross. There now, go away, do.\" \"Steward!\" cried Tom Simpson, and at the moment a negro popped his head into the state cabin. \" You call, massa ? Hi 1 hi !\" \" Yes, 1 did. Let's have something to eat and to drink.\" \" Ya \u2014 ya, drectkly moment, massa.

Oh, lor, ma'am, I don't wear a wig, that I can be hawled at in that way, and not feel it.\" \" Go along !\" cried Mrs. Bell. \" Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear, that I should be spoken to about fat bacon, while I am in such a state, too.\" The negro went grinning out of the state cabin, and then a little door in the wall, that Tom Simpson bad not noticed at all, opened, and Miss Flora Holford came through the aperture like a sylph or a spirit of the vessel to see that all was safe and happy within its pitchy planks. \"Oh, lor!\" said Tom Simpson, \"what a beauty !\" \" My dear, how are yon ?\" said Mr. Holford. \" You monster !\" cried the lady, \"do you mean to make sport of a lone wo man, because she wears a front ?\" Tom Simpson bad got clear of his foe, and smoothing his disordered hair as well as he could, he said\u2014 \" How should I know whether you wear a wig or not ? All I know is, that you have nearly pulled my hair off my head.\" \" Quite well, pa ; and you V \"Much as usual, my child. You know, when you are well that I am well.\" \" Ah, you strive to think so, dear pa,\" said Flora, as she drew a seat close to her father, and placed her head upon his shoulder. \u00bb.\" Nice, that,\" said Tom Simpson to himself. \" Oh, so very nice. Well, I never ! She is a beauty.\" \" Then why did you throw five rasp berry tarts and two cheesecakes at me for, you ill-looking ruffian ?\" \" 1 didn't. I was taking them to that young lady, and the ship gave a move, I suppose, and down 1 went, old lady.\" Mrs. Bell's breath was rather bad now, and she could only shake her first at Tom Simpson and Co., .who, approach ing Flora, said \u2014 \" It was to you, miss, that I was a bringing the tarts \u2014 I was, indeed.\" \" Thank you ; I would rather not take any.\" \" Oh, don't say so. Shall I cut you a sandwich ?\" Now, lest the reader should go away with some notion of Flora Holford in jurious to that young lady's real attrac tions, dependant upon his idea of the taste of Tom Simpson, we may state, that Flora was just sixteen years of age, that she had blue eyes, and very dark auburn hair \u2014 that she had a pretty com plexion, and the whitest teeth, and the rosiest lips, and the sweetest expression upon her really fine, thoughtful, beau tiful face, that can be imagined. That is all we purpose saying about \" No, thank you.\" \"My daughter don't require anything at present, sir,\" said Mr. Holford. \"This is a fellow-passenger of ours, my dear Flora, and 1 am quite sure means to be very kind.\""], [176, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 166 that, after all, nobody cared to know anything about. Flora was mightily amused with him, aud so was Mr. Holford, although more than once that gentleman had cast an anxious look into the corner where Vanderdecken sat alone. Flora smiled, and bowed slightly. \" That I do, upon my fife,\" said Tom Simpson; \"and it's very good of you, sir, to say as much, and give a fellow credit for his good intentions. I'm sure, sir, I have been to a very many places, and seen all sorts of gals ; but I will say, that if there's a Venus in this world, it is your daughter, sir.\" ,: You are very good, sir.\" Flora laughed. \"You are too complimentary, sir,\" she said. \"Perhaps you would like me to call you Adonis ?\" \" Well, I don't know him ; but let him be in what line of business he may, he cannot possibly admire you more than I do,\" It will be remembered that Vander decken had attired himself very richly to go to the church of St. Nicholas, and he was still in the same apparel ; only that its value and richness was very much hidden by the cloak he wore. \" Is your friend well ?\" asid Mr. Holford at last to Tom Simpson. \" Ob, yes ; you mean Mr. Thompson ?\" \" Yes, if that be the gentleman's name yonder.\" \" Oh, yes, that's his name. I told you, I rather think, that he hadrplenty of tin?\" CHAPTER LI. \"Plenty of what?\" C \" Tin. The browns, you know \u2014 money.\" \" Ob, I understand you now. Cer tainly, you did mention that the gentleman was very rich ; but, by his appearance and manners, I thought probably, like myself, he was an invalid, and so felt for him.\" \"No,\" said Tom\u2014 \"no. By-the by, do you like pearls, Miss Holford ?\" \"Yes,\" laughed Flora; \"of course I do.\" THE NIGHT BRINGS A STORM, AND MANT CONSEQUENCES TO ALL PARTIES. That Tom Simpson was an original, with whom it would be nonsense to quarrel, seemed to be the opinion of both Mr. Holford and his daughter ; so they only laughed at him, which was the very wisest thing they could do in relation to him ; and as he was not at all offended at that, it suited all parties capitally. Mrs. Bell only sat and eyed Tom with looks of anger, and aversion, and dislike, and made such a noise in breathing, that Tom was upon the point more than once, as he said afterwards, of asking her to send a note to her nose, politely requesting it to be quiet. But, after all, that was a minor evil compared with any that would have taken him from the society of Flora ; and in the course of the next ten minutes he had told her and her father who and what he was, and become quite confidential about everything but his errand to Amsterdam, and the affairs of the house of Simpson and Co. It is a curious trait in the character of Tom, with all his folly, how he managed, in what he would call a busi ness-like way, to make a profound mystery of every little petty circum stance connected with the business of himself and his father ; but certainly Tom was as close as wax upon matters \" Then I'll just show you some that my friend Mr. T. has, that will surprise jou very much, indeed,\" Tom Simpson was making his way over to where Vanderdecken sat ; but not one word of the preceding dialogue had escaped him, and he rose at once, and gracefully stepped across the cabin, as he said \u2014 \" If Miss Holford has any curiosity to see the pearls, they are here.\" As he spoke, he presented the four large pearls to the young lady, who took them in her fair, small hand, and looked at them with surprise. \"Look, pa,\" she said. \"Are they not beautiful ?\" \"They are rare,\" said Mr. Holford. \" I never saw any so large as that one. These pearls are of great price, I sup pose, Mr. Thompson f* \" Probably in the markets of the world,\" said Vanderdecken, \"they"], [177, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 167 would have a high value set upon them. Do you admire that one your father alludes to, Miss Holford ? \" not scruple to do so. \u2014 I have others, and heed them not.\" \"But, my good sir,\" said Mr. Hol ford, \" I don't pretend to be much of a judge of these matters, but I am confi dent a pearl of that size and beauty must be worth a couple of hundred pounds, at the very least. Perhaps double that amount, for all I know.\" \" It don't matter, sir, about the price that some people would put upon it,\" said Vanderdecken. \" I should never change it into gold, aud, therefore, to me it is nothing, and of no positive value. Believe me, sir, I do not offer the pearl to your daughter from any feel ing of ostentation, or with any idea that I am making an expensive gift. It is not so \u2014 I consider it nothing.\" \" You are very kind, Mr. Thompson, but I cannot accept it.\" \" I will not press it upon the young lady,\" said Vanderdecken, with a bow, \"and I am fully aware of the feeling that prompts you to decline it.\" \" I hope there is no offence ?'' \" None in the least, sir. I know you cannot feel as I do with regard to this matter, and if I felt as you do, I should act as you act, no doubt.\" \" But, dear me,\" cried Mrs. Bell, \"is it a pearl?\" \" Yes, madam.\" \"Indeed I do. How could I do otherwise ? \u2014 although, perhaps, after all, it is the acquired knowledge that these little gems are of great value that makes us think them much more beauti ful than we otherwise should.\" \" Not a doubt of it,\" said the father. \" We are but too apt to let our ima gination,\" said Vanderdecken, \" elate us into a belief that what is rare is valuable. Were pearls as plentiful as pebbles in the streets, no one would Stoop for them.\" \"Oh, but I should,\" said Flora, \" for, after all, pearls are beautiful for their own sake.\" \" So I think,\" said Tom Simpson, \" and this one is the most beautiful I ever saw.\" \"We are much obliged to you,\" said Mr. Holford, \"for the sight of these pearls. Are you English, Mr. Thompson ?\" i \" Yes, but have resided long abroad.\" \u2022PI thought by yonr costume that you were from the Netherlands.\" j . \" I am so attired, I believe.\" \" You can't think sir,\" said Flora, \" what a pretty collection of quite com- mon every-day pebbles and shells I have at home, and how well they look if care- fully cleaned and preserved. I some- times flatter myself that they are quite rare, and that I have a collection of precious gems.\" \" A real pearl\u2014 not\u2014 not glass ? Oh, dear me, and you don't want it, sir\u2014 you would have given it to this in fant?\" \" Infant, indeed !\" said Tom Simpson. \" What an engaging infant !\" \" It came from the sea, madam,\" said Vanderdecken. * You should make such a collection,\" said Vanderdecken, and taking up the largest of the pearls, he added \u2014 \" Per mit me to offer you this as a begin ning.\" \" Yes, I know that, my dear sir.\" \"And to the sea it returns,\" he added, as he flung it through the little round open casement of the cabin. Mrs. Bell uttered a shriek, and Mr. Holford looked rather surprised, while an expression of regret was upon the face of Flora. Tom Simpson ran to the window to look oat, and got a face ful of spray, which made him come again in, looking like a marine god, and sneez ing dreadfully. \" It is gone,\" he said. The little party in the cabin of the Mary-Jane could not have looked more thoroughly amazed if a pearl had come iu at the casement from the sea, than Flora looked amazed, and so did her father, and Tom Simpson looked from one to the other of them as though he would say \u2014 \" What will they think of that?\"\u2014 Mrs. Bell fidgetted along the couch till she got near enough to see the pearl, and then she muttered\u2014 \" Oh, imitation, of course.\" \"Sir,\" said Mr. Holford, \" I can fully appreciate the princely generosity that would offer a girl such a pearl, but I cannot permit her to accept of it.\" \"Oh, no \u2014 no, \"said Flora. \" Nay,.\" added Vanderdeckeiv \" do"], [178, "VANDERDECKEN. 168 they did at the summary manner in which Vanderdecken had got rid of the splendid specimen of that production that he had offered in vain to Flora. \" Sir,\" said Mr. Holford, after a pause of some few minutes' duration, which was getting to be rather embarrassing to all parties. \" Sir, I am really very sorry that you have acted so precipi tately.\" \" And so ara I,\" said Flora. \" Oh, lor !\" said Tom Simpson, \" you might as well have given it to me.\" \"Or to me,\" groaned Mrs. Beli. \"The man is mad \u2014 stark, staring mad, I am certain, and he ought to be taken care of by his friends.\" \" Oh, you are a goose !\" \"Excuse me, all of you,\" said Vander decken, in his slow and low voice, which had such a melancholy tone with it, and yet was so musical that it dwelt upon their ears like some sweet melody. \"Pray, excuse me, all of you. It was not in a moment of pique or passion that I cast away the pearl, but it was to con vince this worthy gentleman and his daughter that in offering it to the young lady I did not look upon it as a thing of much value.\" \" That is tolerably conclusive,\" said Mr. Holford. \"I merely,\" added Vanderdecken, \"offered it to tbe yoang lady as a spe cimen of a marine production, without the slightest reference to whether it had auy ex-intrinsic value attached to it.\" \"Yet, sir, I am sorry,\" added Mr. Holford, \" that you threw sueh a gem iuto the sea.\" \" And the more I think of it,\" said Flora, \" the more sorry I am, too ; for when you come to consider, Mr. Thomp son, if that pearl was only worth one half the sum tbat you suppose it to be worth, how much good you might have done even witb such a sum of money.\" \" That is true,\" said the father. \" That pearl,\" continued Flora, and her checks had a heightened colour as she spoke, and her eyes looked brighter, \" that pearl might have dried away a tear upon the cheek of the mourner \u2014 it might have made childhood smile with delight \u2014 it might have saved the widow | and the fatherless from despair.\" \"Lady,\" said Vanderdecken, \"all ! that is true ; but I have ample means yet for any produce of that gem which I have cast from me to do all that you say.\" \" Oh, yes,\" said Tom Simpson, \" he has, indeed, I assure you. Oh, dear ! what's that ?\u2014 what is that ?\" An unusual bustle upon deck had attracted now the attention of all the passengers, and they heard tbe captain giving various orders in a loud voice to the crew. Then (here was a great tramping, and such a rattling of chains and creaking of pulleys, and haul ing of ropes, and slapping of convas, that it was quite evident some important changes were being made in the disposi tion of affairs above. \" Oh, dear,\" cried Mrs. Bell, \" I feel certain that we are all going to\u2014what's his-name ? \u2014 David Jones, don't you call him?\" \" Don't say that,\" cried Tom Simp son. \" I wish you wouldn't mention such a name on board ship, ma'am. Don't, now.\" \" It is nothing,\" said Vanderdecken ; and then he retired to the corner again from whence he had come, and sat down in the gloom, and rested his head upon his hands. Flora crept closer to her father, and looked inquiringly at him, and he smiled as he said \u2014 \" My dear, I believe there is no danger whatever. The ship is a good one, and the voyage, to a skilful captain, far from hazardous. You may dismiss all fears, if you have any.\" \" I am with you, father, and so I will have no fear,\" she said, as she locked her arm within his, and looked cheer fully in his face ; but it was quite evi dent, by a strange singing noise above, that the wind was rising, and, moreover, the cabin was much darker than it had been, and Tom Simpson began to be very uneasy, indeed. \" I'm afraid something is amiss,\" he said. \"Oh, no, sir,\" said'Mr. Holford. \" With my inside.\" \" Oh, that is quite another thing. Per haps you are liable to be sea-sick, and if so, the vessel is rather rolling just now.\" \" Yes, it is, above a bit.\" \" I should advise you to lie down.\" \" Yes, sir, it is all very well to advise one to lie down. I rather think I shall"], [179, "VANDBRDHOKS*; OS, T_IK FLYING DUTCHMAM. 169 lie down, for as to standing up, it's quite out of the question. Oil, dear ! oh, dear! I begin to feel something like I felt when I came here from England ; and if ever I do get safe to Newgate Street again, you won't catch me going to sea \u2014 oh \u2014 oh !\" Tom ;Simp3on only waited until the ship gave a throw and then a lurch to windward, and then down he fell and W17RTEM CAKLIS BREAKING INTO THB SAClilSTY TO BESCUB WHILELMINA. rolled right away to the farther end of the cabin, and lay like a log. It was a good thing for him that a chair and a carpet b&*, and several other articles, all rolled after him with the sudden lurch that the vessel took, for they wedged ' him up so that he was kept in the same place when the Mary-Jane righted again, for his strength was completely gone, and he would just have rolled about at the mercy 'of the sea, which was rising each moment. .__,* No. 22."], [180, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 170 \" I am afraid he is busy, madam, upon the deck, but 1 will give him any message you like.\" \" Oh, tell him, then, to go back.\" \"Yes, madam.\" \"Tell him I cannot put up with this sort of thing any longer. Tell him to go back at once if there's going to be any bumping and knocking about, and if he can't keep his ship steady and even, tell him that I would rather not go in it.\" \"Father,\" said Flora; \"therer is going to be a storm.\" \"Well, my child, and if there is, yon know that sliips are constructed so as to resist storms.\" \" Ob, yes\u2014 yes.\" \" And this one in particular, I have no doubt, from being so good a vessel, has encountered many a one, and yet here you fee it safe and staunch as ever ; so there may be a storm, and yet no danc.er. Nevertheless, my love, I think you had better go to your own cabin.\" Mr. Holford smiled slightly as he promised to deliver the message to the captain, and then, having got Mrs. Bell to the door of the ladies' saloon, another shudder and then a lurch of the ship to starboard sent her headlong into the saloon, and Mr. Holford thought the best thing he could do would be to close the door and leave the ladies to look to each other. \" Yes, father, I will.\" Mr. Holford, who had been several long voyages, was able to keep his feet very well upon the cabin-floor, and he led his daughter to the ladies' saloon, as it was called, the said saloon being about eight feet one way, and about ten the other. t They have odd notions ot saloons on board sliips ! The wife of the steward, a negress, was the only female on board, whose duty it was to attend to the lady pas sengers, and it was pretty evident that if any attendance were required she would have it all to do, for the young girl, who was Miss Flora Holford's servant, was already lying upon her back, and quite incapable of moving hand or foot. When he turned from the door, he saw Vanderdecken stauding by one of the little round cabin lights, gazing out upon the sea. CHAPTER LII. THE GOOD SHIP MART -JANE MAKES HER LAST VOYAGE. The fixed look of Vanderdecken sea ward, made Mr. Holford regard him with curiosity. It was quite evident that he was in a state of the most com plete abstraction from all objeots in the cabin. After a moment or two, he spoke in a low tone, and Mr. Holford, by great attention, could just catch these words\u2014 \"Oh, dear, I'll go too !\" cried Mrs.- Bell, when she saw Mr. Holford about to close the door of the ladies' saloon after his daughter. \"I'm an unpro tected female, and I will go, too.\" \" Certainly so, madam,\" said Mr. Holford. \" Allow me to help you.\" \" Oh, you are very good, sir, and a real gentleman. You are, indeed. There's always a storm, and a rumbling, and a blowing, and a bumping, when I come on board a vessel.\" \" Yes, it is coming ! \u2014 It will find me out ! The tempest is coming, boiling up from the deep ! It comes, it comes. It will follow me and my path upon the ocean. Oh, Heaven, is there no mercy yet ?\" The deep groan that Vanderdecken uttered after these \u2014 to Mr. Holford\u2014 most mysterious words, evidently came from the very depths of the wretched man's heart, and the kind-dispositioned gentleman touched Vanderdecken lightly upon the arm, as he said, in a voice of commiseration \u2014 \" Indeed, madam ?\" \"Oh, yes, and I'm always ill all the way, do you know. I wonder if Oh, dear ! \u2014 Oh, dear, there the floor goes again !\" \" Hold my arm, madam. The ship is rather rolling, you see.\" \"Rather, do you call it? I feel as if it were slipping away from under me, and I cannot stand it. Where is the captain\u2014 where is he ? I must see the captain directly.\" \" I am afraid, Mr. Thompson, that you are not well.\" Vanderdecken started and turned"], [181, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 171 round in a moment, and looked keenly in the face of the inquirer. \" What did you hear ?\" he said. \" But little.\" progress; and his knowledge of the geographical position of the coast they were off, convinced him that with such a wind as was now blowing, the Mary- Jane, although she was making good speed through the water, was not sear ing port. All along the winter sky there was 3 strange yellow line of light that had a most portentous aspect, while to the south a huge mass of black clouds were slowly, but quite palpably to the eye sight of any one who chose to watch them, rising up, up over the whole canopy of heaven. The water was singularly disturbed, and of a very unusual light green colour, and the ship was rolling heavily. The captain was by the main-shrouds, with a speaking-trumpet in his one hand, while the other, which was wound round the shrouds, held by a firm grasp that made the knuckles show out cold and white. He called to the men aloft, and his voice was cracked and harsh. \" What ?\" \" You said that the storm was coming, and would follow your path upon the ocean, or something to that effect, I think. Possibly, though, I misunder stood you, sir.\" \" Possibly, so,\" said Vanderdecken, looking keenly at him. \" Heed me not, sir, oh, heed me not. I am what I am!\" With these words he retired again to the same obscure corner of the cabin, leaving Mr. Holford rather confirmed than otherwise in a suspicion that had before crossed his mind, namely, that the mysterious and wealthy man who had thrown a valuable pearl into the sea, was not exactly in his right senses, and that he was anything but a desirable fellow-passenger. Mr. Holford would have asked Tom Simpson something more concerning him ; but when he went and jogged that individual and said \u2014 \" Sir, sir, I want to speak to you, if you please,\" all that Tom Simpson replied, was \u2014 \" Oh, chuck \u2014 chuck \u2014 chuck me over board, do !\" \" In with all sail, there ! Not a rag aloft ! Now, men, cheerily \u2014 cheerily ! Brace the fore-yard ! What, in the name of all that's strange, is going to happen?\" he muttered to himself, and then turning suddenly, he saw Mr. Hol ford close to him. From this, Mr. Holford conjectured that that most horrible of all transient maladies, sea sickness, had laid hold of Tom Simpson, and that it was quite out of the question to get any rational answer from him upoa any subject for the present. Mr. Holford now, feeling uneasy at the coming darkness, thought that he would make his way to the deck, and see how matters stood there, not that the decay of the light was anything very alarming, for he knew that the day had very nearly gone, but it was the strange colour of the twilight-like gloom that was creeping over everything which made him think that something very unusual was taking place, or about to take place, with the elements. Mr. Holford, with some difficulty, ascended the cabin stairs, and emerged from the half-closed hatchway. He then gazed upon a sight which m ade him also rather alarmed and very i e vous. A fierce south-west wind was blow ing, which was unfavourable for their \" Ah, sir,\" he said, \" you have crept up to look at us ?\" \"I have.\" \" Well, you have been a voyage or two, I think I heard you say, sir. What do you think of all this ?\" As he spoke, the captain indicated with the speaking-trumpet the whole of the visible horizon, and then looked calmly in Mr. Holford's face. \" 1 don't know what to think, cap tain; hut you do, I suppose.\" \" Yes, if-if\u2014 \" \" If what, captain ?\" \" If I were in the tropics, or the Chinese seas, but here it is strange. It's the latitude, sir, that makes it strange.\" \"Where are we ?\" \"We have scudded past Holden, and are in the open sea, about twelve leagues, I hope, off the coast.\" '\u2022 And drifting northward ?\" \" Drifting, do you call this ? By Heaven ! we are scudding northward at a good eleven knots an hour. And not"], [182, "VANDERDECE.EN; OR, 172 The captain nodded, and Sam went to rejoin his comrades. \"That, then,\" said Mr. Holford, \"is what is to be expected \u2014 a sudden gust of wind, and then a gale.\" \" Yes, perhaps a hurricane.\" Mr. Holford looked thoughtful for a few minutes, and then he said\u2014 \" Captain, with this wind, you could put back again, and get into the Zuyder Zee.\" a rag of canvas to the breeze. Our main-top-gallant mast is gone. It went like a lath, I don't know how, and j seemed to disappear in the air like a of straw \u2014 I don't like it. All on deck! Is all 'taut above there ?\" \"Ay\u2014 ay, sir !\" The few hands who were aloft secu- ring everything that the wind might have carried away, rapidly descended to the deck. Every portable article upon deck had been already secured. The hatches were ready to be closed at a moment's notice, and the ship was as clear aloft as though such a thing as a piece of canvas had never been bent on board of her. \"We could.\" \"Don't you think, then, that, land locked as you would be there, you might wait till this threatened convul sion of the elements was over ?\" The captain was silent for a few minutes ; and then he said \u2014 \"Mr. Holford, I don't like putting back. It's a thing I never did, unless downright forced to it ; and, after all, there may not come anything of this affair, you know. Who can say ? Such weather as this kind of sky and sea seern to promise is so very rare in this northern latitude, that 1 can hardly persuade myself we shall have it yet ; and if we do, why, the Mary-Jane is a good ship.\" \" Yes ; but you know that you are short of hands ?\" \" Yes, a little ; but I feel inclined to chance it, and the Zuyder Zee, after all, Mr.' Holford, is no,t a choice spot to weather a gale in. It is as full of shoals as an egg's full of meat. No, sir, we shall brave out this little bit of a rumpus, I have no doubt, even if it should come to anything, which it may not, after all.\" The wind whistled through the cord age, and the water swung past the sides of the, gallant vessel. The crew lounged around the binnacle and whispered to each other, and the captain, with his hair blowing freely out from his head, and a look of surprise and anxiety upon his face, kept a roving glance to wind ward. . \" What is going to happen ?\" said Mr. Holford. . . \u2022 . \" Sir, I\u2014 don't know.\" \" But you have ah idea ?\" \" Yes, it ought to be a squall \u2014 it may be a gale. I don't know what it may not, be, for I never saw sky and water look as they do now off this coast in all my life.

Well,- Sam, what do vou think of all this?\" \u25a0 \" I, of course, bow to your superior judgment, captain, and cannot doubt the result. What noise is that?\" A strange wailing noise came over the surface of the deep, and it was evident that it attracted, the notice of the sailors, and of the captain, at the same time that it did that of Mr. Hol ford, for every head was inclined in the direction it came from. The captain then cried'out in a loud startling voice, \" It's a squall. It's coming fast, my men. Give it a clear berth, and bold on.

A squall it must be that is coming, and after that \" \"Why, after that, sir,\" said Sam, shading his eyes with his hand, and looking round the horizon \u2014 \" after that, sir, if it blows great guns for twenty fourhours.l shouldn't think it odd.a bit.\" \" A-lee it is, sir,\" said the steersman, and the ship shook a little in the trough of the surging sea. The captain felt convinced now that"], [183, "THE FLYING DUTCHAM. 173 a squall was coming along the surface of the sea, and his object was that it should strike the ship as much en the stern as possible, so that the shock should be distributed on her length instead of taking her broadside, or oa : the weather-bow.

The crew looked at each other, and the man at the wheel shook as though he had the ague. \" But there was a scream !\" \" Ay, my girl, tell us that,\" said the captain. \"Was. there a scream? or did we only fancy it ?\" \"There was.\" '\u25a0'\u25a0 Mr. Holford, go below,\" cried the captain, \"No \u2014 no.

Did you all hear it, my men ?\" \" Ay \u2014 ay, sir!\" \" And what was it ?\" The crew were mute, and only looked in each other's pale faces with dreary and inquiring glances. For the space of about half a minute there was such a lull in the wind that the ship was all but standing in the water, and rode with an ease ; but the captain held his very breath with expec tation; and then at the moment that they all expected the squall would strike her, there seemed to pass some thing over the vessel, and a shriek so loud and so appallirfg rang in the air, that it made the boldest heart there quake again. Not a cord stirred. The long pennant at the mast-head hung idly. The ship gave a shudder again from stem to stern as though it had struck upon a sand-bank ; and then through the water again it sped, hissing and splashing, and the same breeze that had before urged it on, whistled through the cord age, and sighed around the cross-tree... \" My dear,\" said Mr. Holford, as he placed his arm round the waist of Flora, \"let me implore you to keep below. We don't seem to be in any danger ; but we don't know. There is more in Heaven and on earth, it appears, than has been hitherto dreamt of in my philosophy.\" \"Ay,\" said the captain, \"and on the sea too. Keep her head to the wind ! We mustn't be cast down because of a squeak, though we don't kuow where it came from. Steady, there, at the helm.\" \" Ay \u2014 ay, sir.\" \" But what was it ?\" said Flora. \" We don't know, my dear,\" replied her father. \" We cannot tell you. You know as much about it as we do. But let me implore you to go below now. You cannot do any good upon deck, and you may do some harm, you know, my dear.\" \" As you please, father.\" \"Come, then. Come at once.\" The captain dropped the speaking trumpet from his hands, and looked pale and ghastly. Mr. Holford clung, as if it were his only hold of life, by the lower part of: the main-shrouds, and the crew crouched down under the weather bulwark with looks of alarm. \"Yes,\" said tbe captain. \"Take her below, or it will be too dark to see your way soon. How the night is dropping down upon us, to be sure ! Raise up a lantern to the gaff. Quick, there ! Sling another on her bow.\" \" Ay, sir.\" \" How are we sailing ?\" \" North by east, sir\u2014 only a point or so.\" From the hatchway rushed, then, Flora, her hair disordered, and with every indication of fright in her counte nance.

This way with her !\" The captain sprang to the helm, and altered the ship's course to the north west ; but now that she caught the wind on the larboard-quarter, she rolled heavily through the sea, and it was impossible for any one unaccustomed to the motion of a ship a few points to the wind to keep their feet. The lanterns that the captain ordered were hoisted, and they shed a lurid light through the darkness on to the deck. The dense mass of clouds that had been creeping up from the south had now spread over the whole sky, and it was as black as midnight. Still, with a phosphorescent 'sparkle, the water showed itself of a faint green tinge, and the wind kept up the melan choly whistle that had characterised it from the first. deck was slippery with spray now, as every few moments a tremendous and swelling wave dashed over the weather quarter, and came rushing along to leeward. Upon the whole, the vessel did its work bravely, and, save the small spars that had gone some time before, nothing had given way, and she carried her head as well as could be wished. 40 The captain had had another Iaa\u00ab tern hoisted, so that the three made a kind of triangle, and cast a pretty fair light down upon the deck, and Mr. Holford was able to make his way to where the captain stood, which was now close to the little round house, or what mightbe called the quarter-deck, for the Mary-Jane had a kind of half-deck, raised about a foot from the sheer level of her main-deck. \u00bb> \" Is that you, sir il\" said the cap\u00bb tain. Mr. Holford had taken Flora dowi the cabin hatchway again, and had con ducted her to the door of the ladies' saloon. As they went, he was con scious of having to step upon and over some large soft object upon the cabin floor, but in the larkness he had not the least idea that it was Mrs. Bell who there lav in a swoon. \" Yes, captain. What do you think of affairs now ?\" \" I don't know what to think, sir. I wish I could leave off thinking. There's only one comfort \u2014 we are keeping off the coast, aud as it rather, on the whole, tends easterly, I don't think there's much to fear from it,\" \" That is something.\" \" It is everything, sir. Give the Mary -Jane room enough, and she will go as close to the wind as any craft that ever skimmed the waters.\" \" My dear child, be at peace,\" said Mr. Holford, \"and you may be assured that if any circumstances should arise to make it safer for you to be above than below, I will come to you.\" \" Oh, yes, father, I know that.\" She trembled as she spoke, but Mr. Holford only kissed her cheek, and then left her; He was too anxious to get upon deck again to remain even with her in the cabin, and he knew that she was safer there than she could possibly be in the darkness above. \" And the gale, captain, freshens, I think i\" \" It does, sir \u2014 it does, and yet I don't hardly know what to make of it ; for at times, for a minute together, it will drop, and, take it altogether, it don't seem as if the wind were at al serious about it.\" Again he trod upon and nearly fell over the large soft object upon the floor, and then made his way to the deck of the vessel. \" And that cry, captain ?\" \" Ah, sir, there I am at fault ; I shan't forget it in a hurry. You are more of a scholar than I am, sir. Can you tell me anything about it, or give me any shadow of a reason for it, that I may please myself by thinking that, after all, it ain't out of the course of nature ?\" CHAPTER LI II, THE MARY- JANE SEEMS TO HAVE A NARROW ESCAPE. \"I wish I could.\" \"You can't, then, sir?\" \" Indeed, I cannot.

It is better not to think of it.* \" All right, sir. I won't open my jawing tackle in no such a sort of way, you may depend ; but that's my verdict, and so I says it.\" The sailor now went forward, and the captain, turning to Mr. Holford, said \u2014 \" Ah, yes, that would be better, but you might as well tell a man not to think of grim death when he feels that it is boarding him. Do you know, sir, if I only had heard it, I should take it into my head that it meant that my sand was well-nigh run. But we all heard it, so it can't mean that there's a fate for us all.\" \"Sir, I regret that I did not fake your advice, and put back past the Helder into the Zuyder Zee again, when I might have done so. If any thing comes of this night's work, all I can now say to you is, that I regret it.\" \" Don't mention it, captain, you did all for the best \u2014 and \u2014 and if\" \u2014 Mr. Holford's voice faltered a little, and he added in a low tone \u2014 \" if I were alone, it would scarcely cost me a pang.\" \" I understand you, sir. But cheer up. All's not lost that are in danger ; and after all, it may not be ; but if any. thing should go amiss, I give you my word as a man, here, in the face of Heaven, and with its name upon my lips, that I will do all that man can do to save Miss Flora, and that I will succeed in saving her, or lose my life in the attempt, so help me Heaven !\" \" God bless you,\" said Mr. Holford. There was now a silence of some minutes' duration between them, for they were both too much affected to speak. Mr. Holford was looking in the face of the captain as well as he could see it by the faint light that the lanterns threw upon the deck, and as he so looked, he saw that it \u2014 the captain's face \u2014 got more and more plainly discernible, and became of* dull greenish hue, that was very alarming to behold. At first, Mr. Holford thought this must be some delusion of his senses, but he was soon convinced of the con trary, for about half-a-dozen of the men suddenly shouted out\u2014 ' Look aloft, sir \u2014 look aloft. What's that?\" \"The ship, captain,\" said a sailor, close at hand. \" It's the ship.\" \"Ah, Jenkins, is that you ?\" \" Yes, captain, at your service ; but I take it that there bit of a squeak that came overhead was meant for the ship, and not for any of us specially, you see, sir. If so be as the Mary-Jane goes down, why, it's likely enough we all go down with her ; but it was khe doom of the ship that it meant, or else I'm a Dutchman, that's all.\" \"It must be so,\" said the captain. \"Oh, nonsense. This is super stition,\" said Mr. Holford. \" I am surprised that you should take such an idea into your head, captain.\" \" But what does it mean, then, sir ?'' \" That, neither you nor I are called upon to explain, captain. That it was natural, and that it meant nothing special, you may depend, and I shall not give way to any other opinion, although my science and knowledge will not enable me to lay my hand upon the explanation of the phenomonen.\" \" Well,\" said the sailor, \" it's all very fine to call a thing a phenomonen, but I say it meant the ship, that's my ver dict, and I sticks to it. This is the last voyage of the Mary- Jane.\" \" You nave no other reason, Jenkins, for saying so ?\" \" No, captain, everything is right and taut. The pumps are free, and she gets along like a four -year-old ; but she's a going, sir.\" \"Jenkins?\" The toue in which the men spoke was sufficiently alarming to prepare the cap tain and Mr. Holford both for something unusual, and they did look aloft, when they saw, fastened upon the pinnacle of the mainmast, a strange green flame of about two feet in height, and which, apparently, in defiance of the wind and the motion of the ship, kept startlingly upright, as though it had been a glit tering sword there placed. \" Ay\u2014 ay, sir.\" \" Keep your opinion to yourself. Say nothing of it, if you please, to your messmates. It will only breed the very infection of superstitious fears among them. You, 1 know, will do your duty all the same, let your opinion be what it may ; but we have some young hands on board, you know.\" ._."], [186, "VANDERDECKEN. 176 It was the reflection from this strange green tongue of flame that had given the captain's face the odd colour which Mr. Holford had begun to notice a short time before. Amazement sat upon the face of the captain, and the crew clustered together and looked aloft with awe and conster na'ion. \" To be sure, my lads. Keep an eye on the captain. You see he is all right enough, and that passenger by his side, too, I'll warrant he has smelt salt water before.\" \"Mr. Holford, I have a mind to go up aloft and see what that light really is,\" said the captain. \"Don't. It will only take the atten tion of the crew, if you do.\" \"It would have that effect probably, but yet, what can it mean ? The night, too, I think, gets darker, and see how the waves sparkle.\" If possible, now, the appearance of things above and around the Mary-Jane was more ominous than before. The sky seemed to be lighted up to a vast extent by the strange green flame that shot up into the night air from the mainmast, and it cast a ghastly radiance upon every object on the deck, and more particularly upon the sacs of the crew. The water, too, as it dashed past the ship, was highly phosphorescent, and the spray looked like millions of little par ticles of oxydised copper rather than water in a state of commotion. The ship rolled heavily, and the wind, keeping in the same quarter, came now in flapping gusts, striking heavy blows, as if with some taugible weapon, against the weather-bow. \" What is il ?\" said Mr. Holford. \" The Lord be good to us !\" said the captain. \u2022' But do you know what it is ?\" \" No, sir, no \u2014 but it's a warning.\" \" Yes !\" cried the crew, \" it's a warning, and we are all in a doomed vessel. It's no use to work now.\" The captain, when he heard these words, felt at once how imprudent it had been of him to give way openly to his fears, aud he strove to recall the error he had committed. Springing for ward into the main-chains, he cried\u2014 \" Who says that ? Who talks of giving up while there is a ship bsneath us and a Heaven above us ?\" The startling energy with which these words were pronounced, produced a great effect upon the crew, and they looked at each other now, instead of at the green light at the mast-head. \" What are we ?\" continued the cap tain. \" Are we Frenchmen, or cow ardly Italians, or lazy Spaniards ? What are we, I ask, but Englishmen ; and will an English sailor cry out that there is no hope while a couple of planks of this vessel hold together? \u2014 No!\" \"No, sir!\" cried the crew. \"All's right, sir.\" Mr. Holford thought that he would go down below now and see the state of affairs there, for he feared Flora was much alarmed by the cries aud shouts that had taken place upon the deck of the vessel ; and yet he felt a sort of dread to leave the deck while that strange sight was upon the pinnele of the mainmast, and he lingered by the hatchway with the expectation that it might go, although if it did, it was quite evident that the ship would be in com parative darkness. As he so lingered, he heard a voice upon the stairs, and he knew it for that of Flora's. _w \" What has happened ?\" she \" Oh, I am certain that there is danger.\" \"No\u2014 no,\" said Mr. Holford, de scending a step or two. \"Indeed, Flora, there is not.

But on the next wave went the ship, and then it caught the wind again, and still it made great way under the bare poles ; and the anxiety of the capiaiu to know where he was increased each moment. Every five minutes he was carefully, now, consulting tbe compass to see which way her head was ; and as he knew that so long as she kept a point or so to the north-west she could not run upon any shore, he felt tolerably satisfied, till old Jenkins said, in his grumbling way\u2014 \" It's all very well, but she's making lee way as well as head way, and the compass don't show it you no how. It's my idea as she's drifting east as fast as she is north.\" \" You will not ask me to leave you now?\" she whispered. \"I cannot go below after this. Oh, let me stay here with you, father ! If there be danger, let us face it together, and if there be none, there can be no harm in my pre sence here.\" Mr. Holford found it very difficult to resist this reasoning upon the part of Flora ; so, without attempting to do so, he led her to the little round house upon the quarter-deck, and there shielded her from the wind as well as he could, beg ging ber not to stir from it, which she gladly promised him. The captain, with his face burnished by the green light, and his lip quivering with emotion, ap proached. \" Listen, sir,\" he said. Mr. Holford held by some cordage, and inclined his head, and then he heard, as though far off, a strange and terrible shrieking noise, which now and then changed to a wailing and groaning, that was dreadful to listen to. \"What makes you think that?\" \" Look here.\" The old seaman took the captain to the weather bulwarks, and showed him a rope, with a whisp of old sail attached to it, hanging astern. \" Look at the drift of it,\" he said. \"That shows how we go.\" The rope set out from the ship de cidedly south-easterly, and it was quite clear that, although to all appearance her head was to a point or two to the west, she was drifting diagonally eas terly. \" What do you think of that, cap tain >\" \" Giod God !\" he said, \" what is it P\" \" It is coming on the wind, sir.\" \" But\u2014 but is it the wind P\" \"Oh, no\u2014 ob, no, sir. I have heard the wind in all quarters of the globe, coming and going \u2014 whispering gently off the Spanish main, and blowing great guns in the South Sea : but it never made a souud like that. There's some thing coming on the wind, sir ; but it is not the wind itself.\" \" Don't mention it. We shall be upon the coast of Denmark in an hour if there is no change. I cannot un derstand it.\" Mr. Holford was staggered at this ; but before he could reply, one of the seamen called out\u2014 \" Nor I. What the devil is that ?\" \" Hilloa 1\" cried the crew, at this moment, as with one voice. \" Look out ! There's something on the ocean out yonder.\" The captain eagerly looked in the direction they all indicated, and then he saw a something; but whether it was a human being or some portion of a wreck he could not make out. Doubts, however, could not continue for long, as the object, whatever it was, rapidly neared the Mary-Jane, and every eye on board, except those that were below, was fixed upon it. \" An odd noise to windward, cap tain.\" \" Ay, my lads, I hear it It's, per haps, a squall really coming at last. But let it come. We are prepared for it.\" The clouds above the ship now seemed as though they had dropped down almost to'.touch its masts, and the sea railed to and fro in such huge masses, that now and then, when the Mary- Jane happened to settle down in the trough of it with a mountainous billow upon each side of her, every soul"], [189, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 179 up into a kind of ball, and went across the deck uttering strange cries, till it reached the main-hatchway, down which it at once disappeared. The captain lifted up both his arms then, and cried out \u2014 \"Am I mad? am I mad?\" CHAPTER LIV, THE MARY-JANE HAS A STRANGE VISITOR. As the strange object neared the vessel, some of the crew would have it that it was only a porpoise : others said it was a cask painted green : others, that it was a dead body ; but at last it got so near that they all with a shudder drew back from the side as they saw something that had the proportions of a human being rise on the surface of the ocean, and utter a shrill scream of ex ultation. \"'Ihe boats \u2014 the boats !\" shouted the crew. \" We cannot stay with the ship. Out with the boats !\" \"No!\" said Mr. Holford. \"For God's sake, no ! Mind what you do. You are men and christians, and all the fiends in the world cannot harm you if you keep together, and pray to God. I will go down below and see what this is.\" In another moment it was gone. The captain staggered back into the round house, and Mr. Holford rubbed his eyes with his hands in the hope that he should find all these strange things but the disordered fancies of a dream. The steersman abandoned the wheel, and the ship flew about to the wind, and scudded orer the ocean, although now it took a direct north-eastern course. lie captain was aware of what had happened, and rushing from the round house, cried \u2014 \" Helm ho ! Who is at the tiller f* \" No, father !\" screamed Flora ; \" you must not \u2014 you must not !\" \"Yes, I tell you\u2014 I will go below. It is proper that some one should.\" \" Thompson !\" gasped Tom Simp son. \" Oh, dear ! Thompson is there !\" \"Thompson!\" said Mr. Holford. \" Ah ! where has he been all this time ? It is strange that we have seen nothing of him.\" \" Oh, Lord !\" cried Tom Simpson, \" only listen to that I\" The sounds that came from the cabin now were of the most awful descrip tion. There were yells, shouts, shrieks, and groans, all in one dense confusion, and by tbe racket, it seemed as though some dreadful struggle were going on below. Then the cries approached the hatchway, and in a few moments, to the astonishment and terror of the crew, there emerged Vanderdecken, strugglingwiththe green fiend, who had come so mysteriously on board the ship. They rolled together upon the deck, and fought with a frenzy was dreadful to see. At length Van derdecken rose, and by a great exertion of strength he held the writhing object above his head, and rushing to the side of the vessel, he flung it into the sea. \" God I\" he cried, and then he fell prostrate upon the deck. The green object, for no one could or would give it any other name, uttered a wild cry as it touched the waves; but down it went like a lump of lead, and at that moment the green light that had flashed upon the topmast flew up into the air and disappeared. All was comparative darkness on \" Two of us, sir,\" cried a couple of sailors, as they sprang forward and put the helm up again. \"All's right, sir.\" A wild cry now from the crew for ward caused every one to look in that flirccticn, and even induced Flora to : \"-tea from the round house. Tom Simp son, too, who had sufficiently recovered >,ucl ;o reach the deck at this moment, fell ilat upon his face with terror. The mr crowded round the wheel at which the two sailors clung, and then just about midships, crawling like some strange fish, came the object up the side which had been seen to rise on the waves so short a time before. Jn form this object was certainly human, but it was of the colour of the flame at themast-head \u2014 face,hands,and every part of it. One of the little brass guns that the Mary- Jane had upon her deck was just in the way of the object, aud it rolled head over heels over the _gun, and alighted upon the deck with a hideous kind of sprawl, such as some .gigantic lizard might have made after such an exertion. The green object then roUed itself"], [190, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 180 hoard the Mary-Jane, and the crew felt their blood almost curdle round their hearts at the terror of the scene that they had just gone through. \"Oh, yes \u2014 quite well \u2014 quite well! Where did it go ?\" \" You threw it overboard, sir.\" \" I \u00bb Did I so ? Oh, yes! It came into the cabin, and it called to me ; but I would not go with it. Oh, God \u2014 no ! This is a christian ship, and has been blessed by a christian priest ; and here I am, and I will not go. Oh, spare me \u2014 spare me!\" Those who were around Vander decken looked at each other with as tonishment, and then the captain said, in a voice of pity \u2014 \"The fight with that creature has turned his brain.\" The three lanterns that had been all but extinguished by the presence of the green light, so vivid had it been in comparison to them, now began to shine out again, and the countenances of all upon deck no longer wore that dreadful cadaverous tint that the super natural light had given to them. There was something cheering now about the fact, that as the crew of the Mary-Jane looked in each other's faces, they did not seem like a gang of spectres ; and each man drew a long breath of relief as he guessed the change that was in his own appearance by see ing that that was in his neighbour's. \" It looks like it,\" said Mr. Holford. \" Let us try to carry him down below again. Perhaps he will sleep.\" \" Heaven help him,\" said Flora. Vanderdecken opened his eyes and looked at her. Even the captain seemed a little more composed than he had been, and he called out to his men in something of the old tone\u2014 \" I am better,\" he said ; \" but it was very terrible ! Where are we now ? I will keep the deck. Oh, tell me where we are now.\" \" Cheerily, my men, cheerily \u2014 keep her course.\" r \" Ay, sir,\" said Jenkins, who had taken the helm with a determination not to leave it while the night lasted, \" I have her well in hand, sir.\" \" That will do. Help me, some of you here.\" The captain went towards the spot where Vanderdecken was lying, and a couple of the crew likewise assisted, so that they raised him to a sitting posture. A lantern was brought, and they looked in his face. How deathly pale it was ! His eyes were half closed, and they thought that he was dying. \"That thing has killed him,\" said one of the crew. \" Off the coast of Denmark,\" said the captain. Vanderdecken rose and stood upon the deck, with his wild hair floating in the breeze, and took a long look around him. \" It is well,\" he said. \" Prepare for the gale.\" \" Is there one coming ?\" \"Listen. There it comes.\" They did listen, and now they heard the sighing of thp wind, which had lulled a little, as if to give time and occasion for the terrible events that had taken place on board the Mary- Jane to ensue. It seemed as if from far off now the blast was coming across the surface of the water, and as though in a few minutes it would be sure to strike the ship. \" No, no !\" said the captain ; \" run to my cabin, and in the right-hand locker you will find a case of brandy.\" \" No !\" said Vanderdecken, faintly. \" No !\" \" Hold on !\" shouted the captain. \" Here it is.\" \" He speaks,\" said Mr. Holford. \"Thank Heaven!\" said Flora; for she, too, had come up to the part of the deck where the strange man had fallen. With a whirl and a shout that drowned every other noise now, the gale met the ship, and for a moment every one thought that she was cap- sized, for she careened right down to her bulwarks, and shipped several tons of water, which, when she righted again, poured down her hatches. Then with a shiver from stem to stern she stood I before the wind, and the waters flew \" Is it gone ?\" said Vanderdecken. \" If you mean that horrible being, sir, that came out of the sea,\" said the -aptain. \"it is gone, thanks to you. Are you better now i\""], [191, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 181 past her like those of a seething \"caul dron. and, indeed, in that direction of all others, there seemed to be the greatest degree of blackness now. Mr. Holford, in passing across the deck, happened to stumble over Tom Simpson, and by the aid of one of the crew he took him into the round house, as if a very heavy sea should happen to catch the ship, it would, more than likely, wash his unresisting body over board, and that would have been a sad event to such a personage as he was. It was about half-an-hour after Tom Simpson had been comfortably bestowed in the round house that a clap of thunder shook the heavens, and such a vivid flash of lightning at the same moment lit up the scene, that with one accord the crew and captain called out \u2014 \" Land on the starboard bow 1\" Mr. Holford had just had time to get Flora into the round house, and to close it against the wind and the waves. Tom Simpson was jammed up against a water-cask, and there he lay again quite helpless upon the deck, and the Mary- Jane felt that she was in a gale of wind in the North Sea. The energies, now, of both captain and crew seemed to increase as the circumstances that surrounded them became more familiar than they had been. To be sure, the night was pre ternaturally dark, and the ship laboured more than usual ; but then they knew what a gale was, and what it could and would do, and what it could not and would not. The vessel, too, had been for some hours in a position to with stand such an event, so that all the crew had to do, was to keep everything tight, and take care of themselves. Such a cry as that under such cir cumstances was about the most sug gestive of calamity that could come from any lips, and it spread consterna tion at once among all on board who had the slightest knowledge of the disaster likely to occur from such a cir cumstance in a gale of wind. The view that the momentary flash of lightning had given of the land showed it in the shape of some three o* four high rocky points; and, either it appeared so, or was in reality, not above half a mile distant from the fated vessel, which was driving in that direction with speed. There was little apparent chance now for the Mary-Jane. It was rather a remarkable thing though, now, to notice how, with the presence of real and tangible danger, the character of the captain began to show itself in its true colours. While he and his vessel were surrounded by circumstances that seemed without his control, and beyond all human compre hension,hecertainly had showna degree of hesitation and doubt in his move ments that, no doubt, had had a bad effect upon the crew ; but now he saw and knew all the dangers ofhis position, and he at once exhibited himself as the calm, cool, calculating seamen, and as one who had all the necessary know ledge to bring to bear upon such a coit tingency. The ship, notwithstanding the heavy sea on which she was rolling, was put The old seaman who was at the wheel got his comrades to lash him to it, and as the lanterns had been blown to atoms, the only light upon the deck of the Mary-Jane was that at the bit tacle, by which Jenkins was able to see how he was steering. The great thing now was to keep the ship as much to the wind as possible, for the only positive and startling danger to be apprehended was that of driving on shore on the coast of Denmark. How far off \u2014 or rather, to use the term that fear of such a result virtually suggested, how near were they to that coast, there was no means of knowing accurately, for the ship had pursued so circuitous a course for the last few hours that no one could say where she had gone to. That the gale would last now twelve hours there was very little doubt by the direction from which it blew; but then long before the expiration of that time daylight would come, and that would enable them all to see where they were, which would be a great thing. There was hope in the approach of daylight which no other circumstance could produce, and many a wistful look was cast from the deck of that ship to the eastern horizon with the hope of seeing some indication of the dawn. All, however, as yet was dark and drear,"], [192, "182 VANDERDECKEN; OR, and, sir, if I know anything of the sound \" with her head northward, or rather a fewpointsmore to the north than before, with the hope that she would run clear of the land, and so keep off the greatest danger that could possibly assail her before daybreak. The motions of the vessel now were distressing in the ex treme; for, although she obeyed the rudder, successive seas shook her so heavily, that it was with difficulty any one could keep the deck. \" The sound of what ?\" \" Of shoal-water on a rocky coast ; we are all but in it now, sir.\" \" Lost, then !\" whispered the cap ain. \" Ob, God, no !\" said Flora, as she spoke now for the first time letting both her father and the captain know that she was nearer at hand than they thought her. \" My child ! my child !\" said Mr. Holford, \"it is for you I feel \u2014 for you only, my own Flora. Were you safe\" \u2014 the affected father could say no more. The prospect of such a death for his young and beautiful daughter overcame him, and the tears that coursed each other down his cheeks stopped his utterance. \"Button down the hatches I\" cried the captain. \"If we go on shipping these seas, we shall be water-logged. AVhere is Mr. Thompson ?\" Vanderdecken was nowhere to be seen. Mr. Holford thought he had gone below again, but he was not quite sure that he had done so, for the dark ness was excessive. What had appeared to be a bank of clouds to the east now, was looked upon by all onboard as land, and never was daylight more sighed for than by the crew of the Mary-Jane. It was then that a tall figure rose up before the door of the round house. They could only just see it by the dim night light of the bittacle, and then they heard the voice of Mr. Thompson, as they supposed him to be. \" Fear nothing. I will save her.\" \"Ah!\" cried Mr. Holford, \"I for got you made such a promise.\" \" I will keep it.\" \"No \u2014 no!\" said Flora; \"save my father.\" The captain stood close to the door of the round house, as it afforded him not only a prominent position, from which he could issue his orders to the crew, but, likewise, protected him from the heavy seas which shook the other side of that little deck building, and only \u00abent huge masses of spray upon its roof. Mr. Holford with difficulty spoke to him. \" Hush \u2014 oh, hush !\" said Vander decken. \" The storm is yet to come ; but the danger you dread is not that which will engulph the Mary-Jane. There is nothing to fear from the land.'\u00bb \"That, then, is the coast of Denmark, captain ?\" \" Not a doubt of it, sir.\" \" And we are driving on to it ?\" \" I hope not, sir, I trust, now. I have risued all by altering the course of the vessel. It is better to be knocked to pieces by the gale and these heavy seas that are dashing against us than to run on such a coast as that yonder. We may escape it, though.\" \" Thank heaven that there is a hope !\" \" And only a hope, sir, after all.\" \"Well, well\u2014 that is something. Speak low, captain ; I would like my child to think that there is more than a hope.\" CHAPTER LV. THE LOSS OF THE MARY-JANE, AND THE RAFT. Now, the captain, and every soul on board, considered that there was every thing to fear from the shore, and no thing from the sea ; and when he heard his passenger, Mr. Thompson, talk in such a way, he cried \u2014 '' Sir, you know not what you say ! It is the shore that is our enemy. If we do not strike, I fear nothing.\" \" Presumptuous man !\" said Van derdecken, \" can you, from your poor judgment, say as much as that, and doubt it not ?\" \" A light a-head, sir!\" called out a man, who had been dispatched .aloft to keep a look-out. \" Where-away ?\" \"Right on the starboard bow, sir. it's a lighthouse, I think, sir; and \u2014"], [193, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 183 w Poor judgment, sir ?\" \"Nay, be not angry. I did not allude to your individual judgment. That may be great, and doubtless is greater than that of many; but I should have used the word information or knowledge. You cannot be aware of the changes that are about to take place !\" \" What changes ?\" \" In the disposition of the elements.\" \"Well, sir, if I am not awaie of them, I don't see how you can be.\" \" Be satisfied, though, that I am, captain. And now, what do you think t of the position of your vessel, and its prospects ?\" \"That we shall be bump ashore in the course of the next forty minutes. That is my honest opinion, sir, since you ask it, and seem to know so much.\" \" I differ from you. Listen.\" Bang ! bang ! went such a clap of thunder, that it was awful to hear it, and the whole heavens seemed to open in one quarter to permit a perfect blaze of lightning to show itself. That lurid light showed the position and aspect of every man upon the deck of the vessel for a moment ; but it was with such a dazzling distraction, that no one could forget the sight that it awakened. There was Jenkins at the wheel, lashed to it by a rope that went thrice round his broad chest, and his silvery grey locks fluttering in the wind. Then there was the crew, generally dispersed about the capstan, and looking with eyes of terror at the broad blaze of the lightning in the heavens. The captain had his arms extended towards the centre, for flash followed flash of light ning, and the thunder reverberated over head in uninterrupted peals. It was then that Vanderdecken raised his voice, and screamed out \u2014 \" The wind is shifting.\" \"Impossible!\" said the captain. \"I never knew such a gale as this to take a change so rapidly.\" \"The ship may be worked off\" shore,\" added Vanderdecken, \" if you will permit it.\" \" Do that and you will save us all,\" said the captain, \" for I can hear the sullen break of the short waves even now upon the rocks.\" \" Breakers a-head !\" sang out a man in the fore-chains. \" She will strike in another minute !\" shouted the crew. \" No I\" said Vanderdecken, as he sprang with one bound on to the roof of the round house \u2014 \" no !\" A flash of lightning of intense blue ness and brilliancy revealed the tall gaunt figure to the crew, and then they heard his voice above the roar of the wind. \" Up with the foresail ! Trysails aloft, there ! Reefers a-hoi !\" \"What!\" cried the captain, \"would you hoist sail in such a gale ?\" \" The gale is going. Cheerily, men, to your posts ! Spread your canvas to the east wind !\" \"East wind?\" shouted the cap tain, as he faced to that part of the compass. \" Do you say east wind i\" \" I do. There it comes.\" The ship lurched over to larboard with a heavy sea rolling under her, and it was evident to all on board that the wind had chopped round to the south east, and nearly even to the east itself : so that the order to set the sails was the most obvious policy that could be pursued. The captain caught up a speaking-trumpet, and shouted to the crew \u2014 distant horizon, and Flora was clinging to her father, while all there present saw Vanderdecken divested of his cloak, and in the rich foreign-looking dress that he had worn upon the occa sion of his visit to the church of St. Nicholas. It was but a moment that all this was seen, and the darkness fell with re doubled gloom upon the fated ship. The terrific flash of lightning, and the awful thunder that had accompanied it so swiftly that it was not an affirm able space that intervened between the two, appeared to be but the forerunner of a tempest, that seemed as though it would shake the solid earth to its \" Shake out your canvas, my lads t An hour of this, and we are a couple of good leagues froi 1 the shore.\" The hope of jeing saved from the imminent danp r that had threatened them animate! the crew, and they sprang aloft with cheerful consciences, and in the course of a few moments the flapping of the foresail proclaimed"], [194, "VANDERDECKEN. 184 voices. An air of great activity per vaded the ship, and the lanterns were again run up overhead, so that alight once more shone upon the deck. that it was loose. It was a trying moment that ; for, after all, the shift of the wind might be more apparent than real, or if real at the moment, only a caprice of the storm. For a few moments the sail flapped against the yard, and mast, and cordage, and the ship made no way at all, but seemed rocking to and fro in the sea as though it were past control. The helm was put up to favour the supposition of the change in the wind, and then the flap ping of the sail ceased, and with a heavy rush through the sea, the good ship Mary-Jane sped to the north-west, and rapidly left the coast of Denmark like a vision behind her. \" Saved, by Heaven !\" cried the cap taip. \" Oh, lor!\" said Tom Simpson, as suming a sitting posture, \" where, in the name of all that's horrid, are we now ?\" \" All right, sir, now,\" said the cap tain. \" You don't mean that, do you I\" \" Indeed I do.\" \" You ain't gammoning a fellow'now, and pretending it's all right while it's all wrong, are you ? It ain't a sell, is it?\" \" By do means, sir ; I can assure you that if this wind had not chopped about in the extraordinary way that it did, we should have been bump ashore in another five or six minutes at the utmost.\" Flora burst into tears, and clung to her father. \" Another five minutes and we must have struck,\" added the captain; \"but now we have four hundred miles of sea to amuse ourselves in.\" \"Bump a what ?\" \" Bump ashore.\" \" What !\" cried Tom Simpson, with indignation in his tones. \"Do you mean to tell me that we were so near having something else to stand upon but the wet floor of a ship, and you didn't go out of your wits for joy at the idea ?\" Mr. Holford drew a long breath, but he did not speak. He only pressed his child to his bosom, and looked up at the dim figure of Vanderdecken, which still occupied the roof of the round house, looking like the spirit of the storm. \"Certainly. We have escaped \" \" Escaped ? Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear! And where are we now ?\" . \" Mr. Jenkins,\" cried the captain, \" how does she answer the helm ?\" \" Bravely, sir.\" \" Standing out to sea under a good press of sail.\" \"Then we will have a try at our mainsail. Out with it, my men, all but a reef or two. Let go !\" The thin, keen wind from the east now whistled distinctly through the cordage, and the ship went on like a race-horse, leaving the cloven water surging and swaying in her wake. \" Mr. Thompson,\" said the captain, \" we are much obliged to you, sir.\" \" Are you ?\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 indeed we are. You were the first to notice the capricious change in the wind, and to advise how we were to profit by it. \" Oh \u2014 oh ! and he calls this an es cape ! Here we have suffered all sorts of purgatories by being at sea, and he acknowledges we might have been bump ashore, and he wouldn't go. Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear ! That shows the perversity of seafaring people. Good gracious ! captain, why the deuce didn't you go bump ashore ?\" \" Are you mad ?\" \" Mad\"? No, but you are. What's a bump ashore to being made food for crabs and lobsters at sea, I should like to know? One would have thought that even you had had enough of the sea to be ready to dance with delight at going bump ashore.\" \"You and I, sir, think very differently. The ship would have gone to pieces.\" \" Bother the pieces !\" \" Why, I tell you we were so near \" It is well,\" said Vanderdecken. \"The morning is coming.\" \"Ah, yes, I can see a dull leaden streak of light in the east. Cheer up, my lads, we shall soonhave the sunshine upon our decks again.\" \" Ay, ay, sir,\" cried the seamen, and hope seemed to be in the tones of their"], [195, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAM. 185 WURTEM BEARS THE INSENSIBLE WHILELMINA FROM THE SACRISTY. the land, that I do think you might have thrown a biscuit to the shore.\" nothing to being drowned.

Here's half of the ship fell in upon me !\" \" Oh, it's an animal !\" shrieked Mrs. Bell. \" It's an animal, as I'm a sinner ! Fire\u2014 fire !\" \" Upon my word,\" laughed the cap tain, \" our friend has but a limited idea of nautical affairs.\" \" Rather so,\" replied Mr. Holford ; \"but I wonder, amid all this confusion and the last few hours of peril and alarm, what has become of the rather stout lady, named Bell, who was below?\" The captain brought a lantern, and soon restored peace in the round house; and then Mr. Holford requested that he would see after the servant girl, who was the only person still below of the passengers. The captain descended, and soon returned with the girl, who was more dead than alive with fright ; but when she found that her young mistress and Mr. Holford were both safe upon deck, she recovered her spirits, and was soon safely hurried along with the rest of the party. \" Where is Mr. Thompson ?\" asked Flora. \" We owe very much to him, father; but I do not see him.\" \" Nor I, my child.\" \" Nor I, either,\" >said the captain ; \" but the night is still so dark that any one may be close at hand, and yet not be seen. I suppose he is somewhere about the deck ; but, if I mistake not, he has knowledge enough of a ship to take care of himself, even with a gale of wind like this blowing about his ears. How he came to notice that shift of wind, and to speculate upon its continuance so well, I can't imagine.\" \" He must be an able seaman,\" said Mr. Holford. \" Not a doubt of that. Did you hear how he sang out for tbe foresail from the roof of the round house ?\" \" I had quite forgotten her, and your servant as well,\" said the captain. \" I will go and look after them both at once.\" \" Here I am !\" cried Mrs. Bell, sud denly aiming a blow at the head of the captain with an immense umbreUa. \" Here I am, you unfeeling wretch \u2014 here I am !\" The blow was well enough intended, but owing to Mrs. Bell not being very much used to treading the planks of a ship in a gale of wind, it pitched, and she_fell flat upon the deck, yelling out \" Murder !\" at the top of her voice. \" Why, my good madam,\" said the captain, \" what is the matter ?\" \" Oh, you wretch ! How dare you bring an unprotected female into a ship, the floor of which is all sloping, eh ? Answer me that. Didn't you tell me the ship was a good one, and went as steady as possible ? And now it's all on one side dreadfully.\" \"We cannot help that, madam. Pray step into the round house, if you please, and you will be tolerably com fortable.\" \" The round fiddlestick !\" cried Mrs. Bell, waving the umbrella over her head, till the wind happening suddenly to in flate it, it opened wide witlra jerk and a snap, and then flew off into the darkness in a moment, and was lost to sight. \" Oh, my gingham ! oh, my best gingham! Where has it gone ? Stop \u2014 stop \u2014 stop my gingham J\" Mr. Holford and his daughter could not, for the life of them, help laughing at the distress of poor Mrs. Bell, and the captain could not assist for the same reason. At length, by their united exertions, they got her into the round house, when the first thing she did was to sit down upon Tom Simpson, saying, as she did so \u2014 '\u25a0 Well, I shan't move from here till we get to port, as they call it.\" \" I did.\" \" That was the voice of one used to command, sir, or he never could have done it. I daresay, now that he knows the danger is over, he has quietly enough turned in for the remainder of the night, as a good sailor is very apt to do under such circumstances. You may depend upon it that Mr. Thompson would be up again if there were any real danger to attack us ; but that is not possible now.\" \" Don't say that, captain,\" interposed Floia. \" It sounds like being too con fident. All dangers are possible.\" The captain seemed to feel the policy of holding his peace, and turning to Flora, he said \u2014 \" Miss, I thank you for the caution. On shore, I know there is a proverb \"Murder!\" cried Tom. \"I say,"], [197, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 187 fiat tells people not to hilloa before they are out of the wood, and which means, l take it, that they may be robbed when 'hev least expect, if so be they are im iiuHent enough to let any one know exactly where they are.\" \" Yes,\" said Flora, \" I believe that is the meaning of it.\" \" Well, miss, it holds good aboard ship. We shouldn't whistle till we are clear of the storm, at any rate; for if we do, we don't know exactly what wind may bear down upon us. And yet the dawn is coming.\" All eyes were now turned towards the east, where a long line of grey, cold looking light appeared to be peeping up from the horizon. It was really astonishing how cheering even that faint glimpse of a new day was to all in that doomed ship \u2014 for, after all, the Mary-Jane was doomed. \" Now, my lads,\" cried the captain, \"to work, with you, cheerily. The worst of the storm is over now, I take it, and we thall soon be before the wind with a flowing \" great change that ensued ; and as each man tried to look into the face of his neighbour, and could only see the dim outline of human features, he could not help shuddering with the thought that their trials and dangers were as yet by no means so nearly over as they had hoped and imagined them to be. \" Sound the well again,\" cried the captain. \"Ay, ay, sir.\" \" There must be some mistake.\" The captain bit his lips as he said this. Perhaps he felt how pale they were, and thought that by so biting them he might so restore their colour. The well was hastily, and yet care fully, sounded, and the report was made again. \" Six-feet-three water in the well !\" In less than five minutes the water had gained three inches. Everybody, except Tom Simpson and Mrs. Bell, knew very well what that meant. \"Man the pumps!\" cried the cap tain ; \" and send the carpenter forward here.\" It was at this moment that a voice sung out \u2014 \" Six feet water in the hold !\" \"Ay, ay, sir.\" The clank of the pumps was hear.\" above the whispered conversation in the little round house upon deck, where Tom Simpson had managed to ensconce himself, and where, too, Mrs. Bell was seated upon a heap of luggage. The carpenter of the Mary-Jane was a thorough practical seaman, as well as being as good a ship-carpenter as ever stepped between stem and stern, and in a few moments he obeyed the captain's summons. CHAPTER LVI. THE MARY-JANE FINDS A HOME IN THE DEEP AT LAST. That one cry appeared to spread dismay in and about the good ship Mary-Jane, and even the countenance of the captain blanched as he heard it. That cry, too, seemed as though it had an occult effect even upon the face of nature and the operations of the material world, for no sooner was it uttered than the dense mass of clouds which had seemed to uplift themselves like a curtain, to show that the young day was coming behind them, dropped down again, and shut it out from mortal sight in a moment. The dark now appeared to be tenfold to what it had been b-fure, just on account of the little glimpse of light that they had ; and it was not so much for the effect that that little bit of light had actually produced as for the general idea of daylight that it had suggested to the minds of all who looked at that \"Well, carpenter, where is this leak?\" \" Don't know, sir.\" \" Perhaps it is no leak at all. She has shipped some heavy seas.\" \" Yes, sir ; but she ain't a shipping of 'em now, sir, and the leak gains on us.\" \" Humph ! Well, do you think she has strained any of her upper timbers, and that it is coming in up that way as she rolls ?\" \" Put her before the wind, sir, and see.\" \" I will.\" The captain himself spiung to the helm, and gradually put the ship rights before the wind, which was now blow ing freely from the south, so that after the way she had made, south-east, it"], [198, "VANDERDECKEN ; OR, 188 ivas not likely that even a run of an hour or so due north would do her much of the main shrouds, scarcely seemed to attend to what was doing at all. He had made up his mind to quite a con- trary view of the matter to what the captain entertained, and he only calmly waited until demonstration of the fallacy of the idea that the ship was taking in water through her upper planks by rolling in the trough of the sea to be come apparent, before he started again into life and activity. \" How does she go ?\" asked the cap tain. narm as to bringing her upon a lee, shore. The alteration in the route of the vessel was a very delightful one to the passengers ; for going now before the wind, the rate of motion was much greater, and the rolling of the huge fabric in the trough of the sea at intervals was completely put an end to. To be sure, now and then she rose upon the crest of some monster of a billow, and pitched rather heavily, but then that was from stem to stern, and by no means produced the disagreeable vibra- tory sensations which a different course entailed upon the fabric. \"Oh, lor!\" said Tom Simpson, \"I wonder if we are all going to go at last to what's-his-name's locker ?\" \"Easy, sir.\" Clank \u2014 clank\u2014 clank went the pumps as regularly as though the men were merely exercising themselves. A quar ter of an hour had elapsed, and then with a slight crack in his voice, which betrayed the deep anxiety with which he was likely to listen to the reply, he said \u2014 \" Mr. Jones's I\" gasped Mrs. Bell. \"Madam,\" said Mr. Holford, \"did \" How goes the water now ?\" There was a silence of some few you speak?\" \" Yes ; I said Mr. Jones's locker ; for I heard one of the sailor's say it was there we should have to go, only he did not speak of him with that respect that he ought, but called him Davy Jones. Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear !\" moments, and the men ceased to pump. If they had done any good, it was quite clear that it would be apparent in the lowering of the water Une by this time. The carpenter was about three minutes making his observation ; and then, in a loud, dear voice, he cried \u2014 \" Six feet eight water !\" A shudder ran through the crew, and the captain, for a moment, shook at the wheel so that the ship yawed out of her course. \" What's the matter, madam ?\" \" I am very bad !\" \" So am I,\" said Tom Simpson. \" I don't know how I got up those horrid little stairs to the outside here. Don't you think, miss, that the outside of a ship is very horrid in a storm ?\" \" You call this the outside, and the cabin the in, I suppose ?\" said Mr. Holford. \" Hold on, sir !\" said one of the crew. That cry nerved him again, and he was as steady as a rock. \" Take the helm, Jenkins,\" he said, \" and keep the course as you have it.\" \"Ay, sir; due north?\" \" No, a point to the west.\" \" All's right, sir. She goes easy.\" \" But deep,\" said the captain, as he reached the carpenter; and then he added, in a low tone, to him \u2014 \" Have you any idea of where the leak is 2\" \" Yes, in the after hatch.\" \" To be sure, I do.\" \" You may say what you like about the outside,\" groaned Mrs. Bell, \" but, for my part, I should mind nothing if my inside wasn't in such a state.\" \"So is mine,\" said Tom Simpson. \"At one minute it seems as if my stomach was coming up \u2014 up \u2014 up right into my throat, and then it goes down \u2014 down \u2014 down \u2022\". \" Where the copper is ?\" The carpenter nodded. \" And it is about as easy to get it out as to move the bottom of the ship itself, I take it ?\" \" Don't be indelicate !\" said Mrs. Bell. The experiment of the captain of sail ing before the wind was looked upon by the crew with interest, for they well knew what it was intended to demon strate, if possible; but the carpenter, with his arm through one of the ratlings \"Thereabouts, sir. I never like a hard cargo like that far down. It's death and the devil if it comes to blow as it has blown to-night ; and if a plank"], [199, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 189 does start, why, you may as well take things easy, and let her go.\" \" Hush ! don't say that. I will do my best while there are a couple of planks of the old ship holding together.\" \"That's seaman-like, sir, and no thing but proper ; and you will find me with you in that. The fellows ain't pumping, sir.\" \" Now, my lads,\" cried the captain, \"man the pumps again !\" Clank \u2014 clank went the pumps twice, and then, with one accord, the men left them, and there was a shout of \u2014 you ? If you can save the vessel do so, and you will have the thanks of christian souls.\" \" Hold on !\" shouted Vanderdecken. \" It's coming now.\" The crew had just time to clutch whatever was nearest to them, when a tremendous dash of sea struck the ship midships. How it came, when the wind was in a different quarter, they knew not, but it rolled over the ship like a tornado, sweeping everything that was at all loose before it, and forcing down the hatchways at a terrific rate. \" It's no use \u2014 it's no use ! It's only pumping ourselves to death I It's no use.\" A shriek arose from the round house inhabitants, but luckily, the opening to it was the other way, so, beyond the racket and turmoil of the water passing over it, they came to no harm. It shook, however to its foundation, and Mr. Holford fully expected that it would be bodily swept overboard. \"What's that I hear?\" said the captain. \" Who says it's no use ?\" \" All of us, sir.\" \" Are you men ? Are you English men ?\" \" Ay, ay, sir, we know aU that ; but where are we ?\" cried a voice. \" That's what we want to know.\" The roar and rush of the sea, how ever, as it passed out at the opposite side of the devoted ship to that from which it had come, soon subsided to a low hissing sound, like that occasioned by the receding of the waves upon a bank, and then a single voice called out \u2014 \" Is that you, Johnstone ?\" \"Yes, sir, it is. No disrespect to you, captain, but it is no use pumping, and you, as a good seaman, know it as well as we do. We wiU do anything that looks like a chance, sir, but the pumps are none.\" \" You wish to know where you are, my, men,\" said the captain, evading the question of the pumps, \" and I can tell you that, to the best of my know ledge, you are sixty miles off the coast of Denmark, and not very far from Schleswig, where you make shore, if we are to do so, due east from here.\" \" Where's that chap as sent the devil overboard ?\" said another sailor. \" She rights again !\" That voice was Vanderdecken's. The crew knew that, despite that awful whirl of waters that had gone over him, and had been apparently enough to have swept a thousand men to destruc tion, there he was still upon the round house roof. \" She rights !\" he cried again. \" Where is the captain ?\" There was no reply for a few seconds, and then one of the crew said \u2014 \" You mean our passenger ?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 yes 1 Where is he ?\" cried all the crew. \" Overboard, sir ! Listen to that ! There he is, far away now !\" A wild, wailing shriek came faintly upon the night wind, and then all was still again, save the whistle of the blast through the cordage. That sea had swept the captain and five seamen to a dreadful death amid the surging waters. \" Put her head east by north !\" shouted Vanderdecken. \" here !\" cried a loud, clear voice. There was one vivid flash of blue lightning \u2014 ay, as blue as steel \u2014 and it seemed to play around the very head of Vanderdecken as he stood upon the roof of the round house. \" There he is !\" shouted every one at the same moment. \" There he is !\" The halo of the lightning seemed to linger around the form of Vanderdecken for a few moments, and then the captain, in a harsh, cracked voice, called out \u2014 \" In the name of Heaven, who are \" Ay, ay, sir.\" \" Get a spare sail, and pass it under her keel. It may fob the leak for a time. Button down your hatches. Man the pumps again, my lads. We work"], [200, "VAiNDERDEUlvE.N 190 Ult, for life now. The shore is not half the distance off your captain thought.\" The seamen sprung to obey the orders thus given them by an individual of whom they knew nothing, except that they saw he had a perfect acquaintance with their profession. It was the car penter only who said, in a whisper, to one near him \u2014 again the clank of the pumps might be heard. During the period of inaction though, while the pumps had been idle, the water had made rather an alarming progress, and it was above seven feet when the men began to work again. \" Carpenter !\" called out Vander decken. \" It's just as well to go down in the water as to run on a rocky shore.\" \"You are wrong, carpenter,\" said Vanderdecken. \"There is a bay of some seven miles in width, with a clear, sandy bottom, and plenty of water up to a couple of hundred yards of a good beach, lying nearly due east from us now. We may lose the ship, but save all on board.\" \"I am here, sir.\" \" Sound the well.\" \" Ay, ay, sir. Six-feet-eleven, sir.\" \"That will do. You know, now, that it is impossible to get at the cargo so as to move it. There is one roll of stout copper close to the leak which our united strength would not touch. We must trust to the pumps, and to I her rate of sailing.\" \"The devil!\" said the carpenter. , \" He knows everything.\" I \" It looks like it,\" replied the steers j man ; \" but if he were the devil himself, ' and gets the Mary-Jane into the bay he speaks of, 1, for one, shall be very much \\ obliged to him.\" I \" How does she g6 ?\" called out Vanderdecken. \" Seven knots, sir.\" \" That's more than I expected. We i shall last out now. Sound the well I again, carpenter.\" \" Ay, ay, sir, I'm about it. Six-feet- eight.\" \" Bravo, my men !\" shouted Van- derdecken ; \" you wrtll put new life into the Mary-Jane. You are gaining on the leak, now, with each plunge of the pump rods. Work away cheerily, and you will all see your wives and your little ones again !\" Thus cheered by the fact that they were actually gaining upon the leak, the men worked well. There are no class of men who will work harder or more cheerfully than sailors, when they know what they are about, and see a cheering result ; but, at the same time, there is no class so easily distracted, and com pletely thrown aback, when they think, either from good reason or bad, that there is no hope for them. All that an ordinary seaman, under such circumstances, dreams of is the possibility of getting hold of a bottle of rum, and, if he can compass that glorious possession, he will await death with drunken equanimity. \" Confound him ! how did he hear me, and it blowing great guns in this way?\" muttered the carpenter. \"I didn't know, sir, of the beach.\" \" How should you ? It's a coast you none of you know much of to the north of Hamburgh ; but I know every pebble that lines the shore. The pumps, lads \u2014 the pumps, if you wish to see the sun rise to-morrow.\" \"Ay, ay, sir. We will work with will now.\" The orders of Vanderdecken were promply obeyed now. A sail was drawn under the keel of the vessel, and it had a manifest effect upon the leak. A stem sail was shaken out on the stump of the mizen-mast, and the Mary-Jane sped through the water tolerably well, considering all things. The crew evidently had great faith in Vanderdecken. It is astonishing how far in the opinion of all persons a little success will go. The common-enough expedient of placing a sail under the ship, properly secured, for the purpose of not completely stopping a leak, for that it will not do, but of moderating the influx of water, had succeeded to a considerable extent, and, therefore, Vanderdecken's reputation was in the ascendant. The confident manner, too, in which he had spoken of the distance of the ship from the shore, and the descrip tion he gave of that shore, seemed so marvellous that fresh hope sprung up in the minds of the crew, and once"], [201, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 191 Now, however, the aspect on board the Mary Jane wore a much more cheering aspect ; and if the captain and the men, who had been washed over board by the tremendous sea that had taken its des poiling way over the ship, had still been upon her decks, the hearts of the crew would have been light enough ; but the thought of their fate hung like a weight upon their spirits. They all thought it strange, too, that although they had had a kind of glimpse of the coming dawn after that night of horror, some half hour before; it had totally disappeared again, and all around them was black night. The gale, however, did not get worse, and it rather showed a disposition to wear round a point or two to the west, which was all the better for the course the ship made. I am too young to die yet! Oh, why was I sent into this great world, if I was doomed to be hurried from it, amid such an awful scene as this ?\" \" Flora !\u2014 Flora ! that is impiety.\" . \" No, father, no ; do not tell me that. My heart is all submission. I know not \u2014 I knew not what I said, and Hea ven will forgive me for it !\" She leant upon her father's breast, and Mr. Holford was silent as he clasped his arms around her, and fully expected that that hour was their last hour upon this earth. Poor Mrs. Bell, when she heard the sea come roaring over the top of the round-house, made up her mind that the ship had sunk at once, and seizing Tom Simpson by the throat, she rolled with him into a corner of the round house, shrieking \u2014 \"Save me \u2014 save me! I won't be drowned ! I won't \u2014 I won't.\" \" Murder! police!\" shrieked Tom Simpson. \"I can't \u2014 I won't! I'm a woman of property, and 1 won't be drowned.\" \" Murder !\" CHAPTER LVII. VANDERDECKEN MEETS WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS BATHER INOPPOR- TUNELY. \"You wretch! I ask you to save me!\" Affairs in the round house were anything but satisfactory. \"Fire!\" The sad havoc which the sea had made on the vessel, had produced so much confusion among the inmates of that little deck cabin, that it did not seem at aU likely again any of the in mates would recover, for a time, their eq'nnimity. Poor Flora, whose'whole thoughts and anxieties were centred in her father, had sunk to her knees at his feet, praying of Heaven to save him. Mr. Holford, with his hands clasped around his beautiful child, said not one word ; but in that dire moment of peril, the only consolation he had, which was a terrible one, was that, at least, they should die together, and that the self same wave that carried his child to destruction, would likewise include him in death's embrace. \" It ain't a fire, it's water. Where are we now I\" \"At the bottom of the sea, ma'am.\" \" Oh, dear\u2014 oh, dear, you [don't say so.\" \"Yes, I do though; but I don't believe I should have got there, if 1 hadn't been choked by an old woman.\" \" Do you mean me, sir?\" \" Yes, ma'am, I do.\" \"Then take that, and that.\" As Mrs. Bell spoke, she gave Tom Simpson two great scratches, one on each side of his face, and then let him go. We won't say that Tom was un gallant enough to resist Mrs. BeU with several hem ty kicks in exchange for the scratches, and when the ship righted itself, and the table fell upon Mrs. Bell, Tom Simpson breathe 1 .. hope that that was a settler, arid tendered not the slightest assistance. \" My darling,\" he said, close to her ear, \" we shall soon be both, I hope, in Heaven.\" \"Oh, father, father! Death is terrible !\" The clear, cold voice of Vanderdecken giving his orders from the top of the round house, was the next object that presented itself to the minds of the party \" You will meet your mother, Flora.\" \" Yes ; oh, God, I will try to be re signed ! It is the will of Heaven ! but"], [202, "192 VANDERDECKEN. hand gently touch her arm. Starting at the touch, she turned to pierce th* gloom with her eyes, to see who it was > but she could not. A voice, thought quickly enough proclaimed that it was her mysterious fellow passenger who had offered her tbe coral. there, and Flora clasping her hands, cried out \u2014 \" Oh, father \u2014 father, is there hope ?

I thought\u2014 oh, it was, indeed, a dreadful thought ; but I thought it had gone down, down to the bottom of the sea with us.\" \" Flora Holford,\" said Vanderdecken, \" I would speak with you.\" \" Yes, sir ; I will listen to you.\" \" Not here, what I have to say ia for your private ear alone.\" \"I cannot leave my father.\" \" He is quite safe.

Oh, no \u2014 no \u2014 it cannot ! \u2014 it cannot, you are too beautiful to die, yet !\" There was a most frantic eagerness in the tone of Mr. Holford which alarmed Flora, and showed what a stroke his mind had sustained by the events of the last five minutes, when he really believed, with Flora, that their last hour had \" Yes, my darling, yes. What would you say to me ? I am much better now, oh, so much better. Those tears have relieved my heart.\" \" Yes, father, oh, yes, I knew they would ; but will you not think it un kind of me if I leave you now for a few minutes. I wish to speak to that man who promised to save you if the worst should come.\" come. \" Father, oh, father,\" she said, \" Speak to me in your old way.\" \"My old way? What is it, my child?\" \" You know me, father\u2014 your own Flora.\" \"The sea is over us now\u2014 choking\u2014 it is coming \u2014 choking. My dear, why do we not die ? Is this not dreadful \u2014 we do not die ?\" \"Oh, yes \u2014 yes. Go to him, my child, go, I am better.\" \" I shall soon return. Now, sir.\" Flora followed Vanderdecken from the round house to the deck ; but he took care to pause while still within shelter from the wind and spray, and then, while she listened to him with a scared heart, he said to her \u2014 \" Oh, this is worse than all,\" sobbed Flora. \" Father, listen to me : there is hope ! We shall be saved yet ! Hush \u2014do you hear that?\" The crew at the moment that the pumps were gaining upon the leak, had given a loud cheer, which even above the roar and battle of the wind, had been heard plainly by Flora. She shook her father, and withdrew his hands from before his face, and tried to cheer him again with hope, and then he burst into tears. \" Miss Holford, this ship is doomed. I do not say as much for those who now tread her decks ; but they will have to make a hard struggle for life, if they gain it. The ship is even now settling in the sea, and the land is too far off for us to reach.\" Blessed tears ! How they relieved the choked-up heart! How they cleared the mental vision, when naught else could have performed such a miracle. Let them flow, Flora, you will recognise your father better after a time. \"We shall be lost, then?\" \" Listen. I will save you and your father, that is all I can do; but I wished that you should not be lulled into any false sense of security upon this occasion, that you might have a fair hope of being saved.\" \"And my father?\" \" I will save him, I have promised you so much, and I will most assuredly Flora Holford made not the least attempt to stem the current of those tears ; but as she clung to her father, and joined her sobs to his, she felt a"], [203, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 193 keep my word with you.

Mr. Holford was, by this time, very much recovered from the state of both mental and physical depression to which he had been reduced, and when Flora again crept to his side, he was able to hold her hands in his, and to speak much in his usual tone. \" Yes ; but we cannot think that he will have such power, father. It belongs not to one who is mortal, like ourselves, to be able to control the fury of the elements in such a fashion.

Clear the wreck !\" \"My dear, what did that strange man wish to say to you ?\" \"Alas, father, I have ill-news.\" \" We must bear up against it then, my child, as best we may.\" \" Can you bear to hear it, father, now ?\" \"lean\u2014 I can. What is it? Sus pense, my darling, is worse than the worst news always.\" Flora glanced round before she would venture to say what she had to say, in order to be certain that the com munication did not reach the ears of their fellow passengers, who would only make a sudden clamour in such a case, without in the least benefitting by such a communication. \" Wreck !\" gasped Tom Simpson. \"That's a settler.\" \"The lord have mercy upon us, miserable sinners,\" said Mrs. Bell, sud denly recovering her speech, and at the same time kicking violently, to the great discomfiture of Tom Simpson. \" Go to the deuce,\" said Tom ; \" I wonder what good you are in the world, that you should make such a fuss about dying. You ain't in any business, I daresay, like father and me, and you havn't a banker's account, and you don't expect to be Lord Mayor. Go to the devil !\" All was still. Mrs. Bell lay upon her back, apparently insensible, and Tom Simpson was sitting upon the floor, propped up against the wall, with such a look of utter idiocy upon his face, that there was no fear ofhis comprehending anything that Flora might say, even should the words reach him. \" Father, the ship\u2014\" \" Well dear, the ship ? Go on.\" \" Will be lost.\" \" My heart told me that. He has said so much to you, my darling ?\" \" He has \u2014 he has. Heaven only knows who and what he is ; but he wish ed, he said, to tell me that, and along with the knowledge to assure me, that he would save you ant\" me \u2014 he says that he can and will do so.\" Mr. Holford and his daughter, now that 'dangers thickened around them, only clung the closer to each other, and Flora whispered the advice which Van derdecken had given, to the effect that they were not to think of leaving the round house till he came to them. \"Death is as well here, my child, as elsewhere,\" said Mr. Holford. \" And yet the ship be lost ?\""], [205, "THE FLYING- DUTCHMAN. 195 \" Oh no \u2014 no, father, not death. Did I not tell vou he said he would save us?\" the water, and perfectly unmanageable in any shape or way. Still the men worked cheerfully, for they had not yet become alive to the fact that, despite all their pumping, the leak gained upon them each moment of time, and they soon cut away the main shrouds, by which principally the wreck of the mast and its tackle was held to the ship. \" Yes, yes \u2014 oh, yes. Hush, darling \u2014 hush !\" We ndw leave the inhabitants of the deck cabin to their own cogitation, while we again face the fury of the blast upon the open deck, to relate the cause of the sudden uproar that had ensued. Vanderdecken had become aware tha' immediately after the report of the carpenter regarding the state of the water in the hold, the sail which had been spread over the ship's bottom had given way, and nolonger in the slightest degree stemmed the amount of water that made its way into the ship. The time that it would have taken to place ano ther in a similar position, even if the crew had not been too dispirited to do so, would have produced just the same effect upon the general condition of the vessel, as the continuing at [the pumps would do, for they at the first mention of such a disaster would have been de serted at once. With a rush and a tremendous lurch, the whole of the confused mass of sails, cords, cross-trees, and rigging, along with the mast, went from the vessel's side into the sea, and the Mary-Jane righted again, and for some few minutes rode upon even keel, and was half a foot higher out of the water. \" That's right, my men,\" said Van derdecken ; \"now to the pumps again.\" \" Ay, ay- sir.\" \"Any one overboard by that last squall ?\" \" No one, sir.\" \" Cheerily, then, to work, and let us hope still.\" The pumps had made two plunges, when the carpenter, who, for his own satisfaction, had ascertained the real state of affairs, suddenly sprang upon the carriage of one of the cannonades that the Mary-Jane carried, and hold ing on by a rope, he called out \u2014 \"Comrades, I have something to say to you.\" The clank of the pumps ceased on the moment, and every one was atten tive to the carpenter, who, they knew, was not likely to say anything at such a moment to them unless it were worth the hearing. Vanderdecken at once guessed what the communication was going to be, but he did not make the slightest effort to stop it: He knew that such would be useless. The once good ship Mary-Jane, therefore, settled deeper and deeper in the sea, and became more and more un manageable to the helm. The wind appeared to have lulled for a time, and it was during that partial lull that Vanderdecken had spoken to Flora Holford ; but that was but a de ceptive calm, for Vanderdecken had not been many minutes upon the roof of the round house again when there came such a sudden and tremendous squall, it was quite out of the question to pro vide against its fury, and the main-mast at once snapped off, within eight feet of the deck, and with all its top hamper work, fell over to starboard. This was the noise which had been \"Comrades,\" cried the carpenter, \"we have sailed together a goodish while, and I don't like to see you a throwing away your strength when you'll need it all. The leak gains upon us, and the ship is settling fast.\" This was quite sufficient for the sailors. With a shout of fear and anger they at once left the pumps, and stood gazing around them in dismay upon the slippery deck, which was washed by the salt water, and strewn with broken shells and long pieces of seaweed that heard in the round house by those who were waiting with such deep anxiety the issue of events upon that night of storm and of terror. The strength of the crew had been so much weakened by the loss of the cap tain and the five men who had been washed overboard with him, that the pumps had to be deserted for the pur pose of getting hands enough to clear the wreck ; for while the ship was so encumbered, she was like a log upon"], [206, "VANDERDECKEN; OR 196 all the rest to me. I will do all that can be done, and I have hope. Go, sir. I pray you to leave the deck ; and what ever you do, if there should, as there will, arise a cry for the boats \u2014 I say, whatever you do \u2014 let it move you not ; for so surely as any embark in so fraB a thing as a ship's boat in such a sea, do they go to death.\" Mr. Holford shuddered. had been thrown onboard by the violence of the storm. \" No more work,\" cried one. \" But plenty to drink !\" shouted another. \" Hurrah for old rum !\" screamed out a third, and the rest, like maniacs, joined in the wild cry. \" I will obey you, mysterious man,\" he said. \"I feel that in you, and through your exert ion s, lies our only hope. You will not desert my innocent child ?\" \" Oh, God\u2014 no !\" \" Upon your soul, you will not ?\" Vanderdecken groaned, as striking his forehead, he said \u2014 \" Upon my suffering soul I will not!\" \" God bless you I\" said Mr. Holford, as he retired into the round house again just in time to escape a heavy sea that came sweeping over the doomed ship. Vanderdecken covered his face with his hands. CHAPTER LVIII THE FLYING DUTCHMAN CRUISES OUT OF THE USUAL LATITUDE. The shouts and the cessation of the clanking of the pump-chains reached the ears and commanded the attention of the shivering throng in the round house, and Mr. Holford contrived to stagger to the door of that little cabin and to try out \u2014 \" What is this ? AVhat is the mean ing of this ?\" Vanderdecken stood upon the roof of the round house, with his arms crossed upon his breast. \" It is not much,\" he said. \" They will striye no mdre, that is all. They will work no more.\" \"Did he say God bless me? Did he say it ? Ah, yes ! Like a flood of joy upon my shuddering spirit the words fell. At last a human being has said ' God bless you I' to me. Oh, Heaven! accept what I shall strive with your help yet to do this night as some earnest of mv dee; repentance for my dreadful sin!\" \" Can this be possible ?\" \" It is true, sir.\" \" Ojjj are you men?\" shouted Mr. Holford. \" Do you call yourselves Englishmen, and do you think that you will support your character as such by abandoning the ship, and all within her, to tire fury of the elements ?\" \" Hold your row !\" said one. \" Clew up your jawing tackle, old gentleman,\" said another; \"it ain't of no use making a fuss about it. We are all a-going to Davy Jones's locker, and I, for one, prefer to go merry to sad ; what say you, comrades, eh ?\" \"All right! Bravo!\" \" And this is to be the end !\" gasped Mr. Holford. \"This way \u2014 this way !\" cried one of the crew, who was armed with a hatchet, and headed his companions. \"This way !\" \" Ay, ay,\" shouted the others. \" Fol low Tom Loftus. He's the chap. This way, hearties. Hurrah !\" \" Hold !\" exclaimed Vanderdecken. \"Hold!\" They all paused and looked at him earnestly, and at last one cried out \u2014 \" Well, messmate, and what's the matter with you, eh ?\" Vanderdecken leant down from the roof oflhe round house, and touched him oafche shoulder. \" Rem-e, sir,\" he said. \" Retire, and support the sinking courage of your daughter. There is still a struggle to be made for life, and it should come upon you when you are as well prepared for it as possible.\" \" But how can I be prepared ?\" \" By ke'eping calm and still. Leave This produced a laugh, and Vander decken spoke not till it had subsided; then holding aloft his long arms he cried out, in a voice that rose above the whistling of the wind and the wash of the sea \u2014 \" What would you do ? Madmen, what would you do?\" \" Oh, you know well enough. You have smelt salt water often enough, old fellow, to know what we are going to do;"], [207, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 197 and the best thing you can do is _to come down from aloft there, where the devil himself must hold you on by the hair of your head \u2014 for I don't know how else you stay \u2014 and come with us.\" \" Where ?\" in search of the spirits, and tne Mary- Jane rolled like a log upon the water, sometimes making a little head-way, then going broadside to waves, and now and then making stern-way. \"The tiller is jammed up, sir,\" said the carpenter, \" and it's no use trying it. It's all up with us now. Oh, for the morning !\" \" Why, to the chief cabin, to be sure, where the captain has got rather a choice few dozen of old rum and hollands.\" \" You would get drunk ?\" \" Well, we know the old ship is going, and we don't want to go with faces as long as Methody parsons, so we mean to have a drop to cheer us up, you see, a bit. Come on, comrades.\" \" Stay a moment. Let me advise you.\" \" Oh, come on ; he only wants to ask us to mix our grog instead of taking it neat, that's all. Come on, mess mates.\" Vanderdecken jumped from the roof of the round house on to the main deck, and despite the wind and the spray, he got together a fe-w loose timbers that had settled to lamoard during the storm, and reposed against the weather bulwarks. The carpent, r aided him effectually, and '*^? got about half a dozen lengths of wood lashed firmly together. \" It will float,\" said he. \" Yes, my good fellow,\" said Van derdecken. \" It is our poor passengers I would fain look to.\" \" It's not no use a mixing of it,\" said another; \"let's take it neat. It will get lots o' watering when the ship goes down.\" \" Ay, ay \u2014 all right.\" \" [ have only a word or two to say to you,\" resumed Vanderdecken. \" I think it just possible the ship may yet float till it get ashore, or till morning, when some sail may appear, and take us off the wreck.\" \" No, no,\" said the carpenter ; \" I know better than that. There's one \" Ah, sir, there is only one charce, and that is, of being picked up, you see, by some sail at daylight, and that chance is all the poorer, that *?;; sight has been such a one as it is ; I doubt if we shall find any craft so near as we are in shore, that can have i\"ifccred out the gale of this awful night.\" \"Perhaps not. We can but try. You are, no doubt, a good bold swim mer, are you not ?\" \" Well, I may say yes, * \u2014 rr\u00bb*\u00bb, to that.\" boat sound and whole, and that will hold a good dozen of people. Who feels disposed to try to get off in that?\" \" To certain destruction,\" said Van derdecken. \"Very well, then, we -^f \u00ab_*ke another raft of the few remaining pieces of spar.\" They lashed them together, and so they had two rafts, each of about eight feet in length, and some thv or tout feet wide. Vanderdecken so disposed some cords, that they could be quickly lashed around the bodies of those who would, he foresaw, have to trust them selves to such a conveyance on the surface of the deep, and then Is went to the round house, dragging tbe raft with him. \"I don't know that,\" said one. \" The ship goes easier.\" \"Water-logged,\" said the carpenter. \"You don't expect a ship down nearly to her ports in the sea, and with a hundred ton of salt water in her, to roll like one high on her keel, stupid, do you?\" \" It is madness to take the boat,\" said Vanderdecken. \" It is insanity of the worst foim to drink. Better trust to the frailest spar that ever floated in the deep sea, than to the demon spirit of intoxication. Who will help me with a raft?\" The carpenter followed him. It was amazing how stately the ship I now floated, notwithstanding the state I of the sea now ; but the ex ! planation of that seeming mystery was just what Vanderdecken \\~4r \u00abrtven, namely, that the vessel w< pf f*np \" I will, sir,\" said the carpenter. \" Rum !\" cried one of the crew. AVith a roar of drunken anticipation they rushed down the main hatchway"], [208, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 198 Vanderdecken laid violent hands upon Mrs. Bell, and dragged her on to the raft, to which he tied her. Then seizing Tom Simpson by the back of the neck, he held him down upon it till he had secured him, despite his yells for mercy, for he thought, and he would not give himself time to hear to the contrary, that Vanderdecken was about to sacrifice him to the fury of the elements in some way. iri the water, that it was quite impos sible she could roll much. The cessation of the disagreeable pitching and tossing of the ship, how ever, had a very favourable effect upon Tom Simpson and Mrs. Bell. To be sure, the latter seemed to be in a state of mental confusion that rendered it quite impossible she should say any thing with the smallest pretensions to rationality; but that was to be ex pected. As for Tom Simpson, the proba bility is, that ha would even have con sented to give up the acquaintance and consideration ol the Lord Mayor of London, if he could but have found himself safe in h is,' father's counting house in Newgate-street; but fate did not feel disposed to make any such compromise with the heir of all the Simpsons. Mr. Holford sat looking firm and resigned, and Flora was kneeling, rest ing her head upon his knees. \"Oh, lor!\" said Tom Simpson, \"as if there wasn't girls in London that would do for me well enough, but I must come all the way to Holland to look for one, and then be drowned in coming back again, after she wouldn't have me by no manner of means. Oh ! oh ! How do you feel now, Miss ?\" Flora made him no answer. \" Carpenter,\" said Vanderdecken, \" will you take charge of that raft and do your best with it ? I will ensure you an ample reward if you can save those two persons.\" \" Never mind the reward, sir. I'll do the best I can for 'em, poor souls ! I hopes as we are all Christians enough for that.\" \"Amen!\" said Vanderdecken; and then turning to Mr. Holford, he said \u2014 \" Now, we have ten minutes more to remain on board this vessel.\" \" Heaven save us !\" \" Only so brief a time ?\" said Flora. \" Then all is lost !\" \"Not so. Have I not said that I would save you ? Do you think that now, at the moment when it becomes necessary that I should keep my word, that I am going from it ?\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no ! I do not doubt you \u2014 I never, for a moment, doubted your will to save us ; but what can a mortal man do against this world of waters ?\" \" We will see. All that I require of you is, that you should implicitly yield yourself to my instructions. It is pos sible, then, that I may save you ; but if you cannot have sufficient faith in me, say so.\" \" We do, sir,\" said Mr. Holford, in an agitated voice ; \" we do yield our selves entirely to your guidance. Do we not, my child ?\" \"Yes,\" said Flora. \" Come this way, then.\" Vanderdecken led them both from the round house to the little raft he had constructed, and he explained to them how they were to be possibly saved by its agency. They yielded in all respects to his injunctions, and he tied them securely to the raft. \" Now,\" said, \" fear nothing ; for as surely as there is a God in heaven, 1 will not desert you.\" \" Well, ma'am,\" said Tom Simpson, then addressing Mrs. Bell, \" how do you feel, ma'am ?\" \"Pickled pork, and cabbages,\" replied Mrs. Bell. \" Not too fat.\" ' \" Oh, lor ! [what does she mean ? Why, she's gone out of her blessed mind. Well, I don't wonder at it. However, it don't seem to be so bad as it did, and the ship seems to keep on its legs a little better.\" It was \"at this moment that Van derdecken entered the roundhouse. \" It is my duty to inform you,\" he said, \" that the ship is settling fast.\" \" Oh, thank you,\" said Tom Simp son. \" Perhaps my stomach will soon follow the example and settle too. I am sure it has much need of it.\" \"You mistake me.

And now the once good ship Mary- Jane settled still lower and lower in the bosom of the deep, and as the water dislodged the confined air from the cabin, the planking upon the deck began to rip up by its force, and with yells and shouts of alarm, the drunken sailors rushed from the main cabin, into which the sea began to make a clean breach, so as quickly to fill it. The rum and the hollands had done their evil work, and the crew, with only two or three exceptions, were in a state of intoxication. Oaths, shrieks, wild laughter, and every species of ribald execration came from their lips. One approached the planks to which Mr. Holford and his daughter were clinging. \"Hilloa!\" he said. \"Here's the CHAPTER LIX. TAKES A PASSING GLANCE AT AFFAIRS IN AMSTERDAM. Our readers will, no doubt, reaollect, notwithstanding the long time that we have been compelled to keep them at sea, that there is such a person as Wurtem Carlis in the world ; and that there is, likewise, a Whilelmina and a Myneer Von Straken. By a little reference back to our pages it will be found that those individuals were in a much more pleasant state of conjunction than they had yet been since the commencement of this most recondite and highly veracious nar rative. In fact, Mynheer Von Straken had found out that, after all, he might go farther in search of a son-in-law, and fare worse, than in pitching upon Wurtem Carlis to fill that situation. We are bound to give the old mer chant credit for the best intentions, and to suppose that it was solely with a view to the happiness of his child, Whilelmina, that he now acted. To be sure, Von Straken knew, for he saw evidences enough of it, that the pecuniary position of Wurtem Carlis was rather a different one to what it had been ; and, to be sure, he had heard from Whilelmina that Vanderdecken had, in the handsomest manner in the world, given up all claim to her hand, and to the diamonds that still remained in the possession of Mynheer Von Straken ; but still, as we say, it is a hard thing to accuse the illustrious Dutch merchant of any selfishness in the affair, when the bridegroom himself \u2014 for such Wur tem began to consider he was \u2014 did not think proper to do so. Imagine, then, Mynheer Von Straken in such a dressing-gown as never surely was seen before, at the door of his own house, inviting Wurtem Carlis in. \" Come, meine young friend \u2014 come into the house \u2014 meine Got \u2014 of your father-in-law, that is to be. Pose! How strangely things do happen.\" \" They do, indeed, sir.\" \" Ah ! I wonder where I put meine pipe ?\" pretty little piece of goods who was our cabin skylark.

Down with him !\" \"A sail !\" shouted the carpenter. Every one's attention was now directed to the weather quarter. Even Vanderdecken himself sprang upon the roof of the round house again to look out, and there, coming as if right down upon them, was a ship in full sail, with every inch of canvas spread to the gale. \" Oh, Lord !\" cried the carpenter, \"it is the Flying Dutchman ! It is all up with us now!\" \"Vanderdecken ! Vanderdecken !\" came a long, wailing voice from a dim figure on the prow of the spectre vessel. \" I don't think you brought one out with you Mynheer Straken.\""], [210, "VANDERDECKEN. 200 stancy ?

Ah, I think I hear the dear chick now sighing like one pair of bellows.\" \" To be sure, it is.\" \" Ah, some one has been maligning me to you, I know, or you would not treat me thus, after all that you know of my devotion to you.\" \"Yes, I would. I don't like you now.\" \"Not like me?\" \" Dear Whilelmina,\" ejaculated Wurtem Carlis, \" it shall be my task to stem the current of that grief, and to dry those tears.

Why, I would not have her if every hair of her head were hung with a diamond, that I wouldn't ; and I little expected this treatment from you after you had thrown me a tulip from the window.\" Now, Wurtem Carlis was impatient \u2014 as all true lovers always are \u2014 and he made a rush to get into the house just i as Mynheer Von Straken had made a kind of lounge at the doorway, and the consequence was, that they both blocked it up, and poor Wurtem ran a good chance of being there and then crushed to death against the door-post of his father-in-law's house, and so ending his career. \" Murder !\" said Wurtem. \" Meine Got ! what is this ?\" said old Von Straken. \" I shall be smashed !\" cried Carlis. \" Somebody is pushing !\" shouted Von Straken, and then down he fell on his hands and knees, which had the effect of liberating Wurtem, and he took aflyingleap right over old Von Straken's back, and alighted in the passage be yond him, doing no further damage to the old merchant than knocking off his wig as he went over him. \" Meine Got !\" said Von Straken, \"one something has jumped over my back, and I am nearly a dead merchant of Amsterdam!\" \" It fell out.\" \" Oh, did it _\"' \" To be sure, it did.

Good-bye. I feel that I am not fairly treated, and so \u2014 \" \" Well then, read that, you wretch.\" As she spoke, Whilelmina took from her bosom a letter and threw it at Wurten Carlis, whose curiosity was sufficiently awakened to induce him to pause to read it, and to his surprise he found that it contained the following words, in rather a business-like hand ; \u2014 \"Oh, the wretch!\" \" Well, of course, it is not for me to call a young lady names ; but I satisfy myself by solemnly declaring the utter falsity of that letter.\" \"And the part of the dowry she mentions ?\" \"My dear Whilelmina-\u2014 \" As I am going to be married to Mynheer Wurten Carlis, and as it is all settled but the day, and my father has even paid to him some portion of my \" I have not received a farthing of it ; on the contrary, Von Rotter still"], [213, "\u2022I-HE FLYING DUTCHMAN. holds money of mine as a banker, for which he has the bill of one whose security he told me himself he would take for twenty times the amount.\" you have settled all that, you can come and tell him, meine Got.\" \" Very good, sir,\" said Wurtem, \"I will be sure and come.

I have given my daughter to Mynheer Von Carlis, and they are in the kitchen settling the wedding day. Now, Martha, if you hear too much kissing going on, will you go into the room for something, and cry out, \u2014 'Ah, stop that I' you un derstand ?

He covered her face with kisses till she could hardly breathe, and then the door flew open, and old Von Straken rolled into the room, ex claiming as he did so \u2014 \" Stop\u2014 stop\u2014 stop !\" \" Oh, sir,\" said Wurtem, \" I am so bappy.\" \" Very likely, meine son-in-law that is to be ; but put off the kissing, meine Got, till after the marriage.\" CHAPTER LX, WURTEM carlis seems to be at THE SUMMIT OP HIS HAPPINESS. Chuckling at his own cleverness in the watch be had set upon the young lovers, Mynheer Von Staken went quite composedly into the parlour to smoke his pipe. Now, Martha was very much in favour of Wurten Carlis, since he had taken occasion to bestow upon her divers gold pieces with a very liberal hand, and, therefore, she at once went into the kitchen, and said \u2014 \" Kissing, father ? Well, I'm sure, I wonder what put that into your head ?\" \" Meine Got, didn't I hear it \u2014 meine Got, didn't I see it ? Ah \u2014 pose ! \u2014 pu it into my head, indeed ! That is one good idea!

To be sure I do. Perish the thought of watching either of you.\" \" What can you know, father ?\" \"Ah ! catch one weasel asleep ! Ah!\" \" Well, sir,\" said Wurten, \" I think I may as well mention, that Whilelmina and I are quite agreed, and the sooner the happy day that is to make her mine is fixed, the better it will be for me; as 1 shall know, then, that it will be impossible for envious fortune to deprive me of her whom I love better than life it3elf.\" \"I am much obliged to you for your good opinion, Martha,\" said Wurtem Carlis, \"and I|hope you will be so good as to accept of this.\" j He held out a gold piece as he spoke, \" Well, my childer, you must settle all that between you. The old man will go and smoke his pipe, and when"], [214, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 304 1 which Martha took adroitly enough, 1 saying as she did so \u2014 '| \"Ah, very good, young people, I wish I you all the happiness in the world.

It is not at all likely that he will continue, after showing you so much good feeling, to utterly neglect you. Do you not think, now, that you shall see him again ?\" \" I sometimes think I sliall.\" \" She get married !\" cried Martha. \" Oh, dear, no. There's no fear of that. I'll wager, that the poorest clerk in the banking-house wouldn't have her, with all her money \u2014 not they. Ah, she's a little wretch, is Truchden.\" Martha left the kitchen, apostro phising Truchden in no very measured terms of deprecation, which Whilel mina was quite delighted to hear, now that she felt so satisfied of the good faith of Wurtem Carlis. \" Well, I feel sure that you will.\" \"Ah, Whilelmina, I care little for Jan- Van, or for all the world, now that I can call you mine.\" \"Is that true?\" \"As gospel it is, my darling, But you have not told me exactly what that strange man said to you in the sacristy of the old church of St. Nicholas, and I am quite dying to hear it.\" \" Well, then, you shall not die, and I will tell you. Well, you must know, first of all, he carefully fastened the door.\" During the half hour that followed, Wurtem told Whilelmina all that had passed at the house of Yon Rotter with regard to Truchden, and that, as may be supposed, was a recital which awakened the most lively indignation in thfi breast of Whilelmina. \" Confound him, yes, I know he did.\" \" Well, then he\u2014 he\u2014 \" \" He did not attempt to kiss you, did he?\" \"Theliitle, monster,\" she said; \"I only hope I shall meet hpr by the side of the quays some day, 1 shall then have the gratification of pushing her into the water.\" \" Oh, no ; he only offered me a chair.\" \" Oh, very good ; because, if he had dared to\" \u2014 here Wurtem kissed Whilel mina \u2014 \" to think of kissing, i really \u2014 \" \" Now be quiet, do.\" \"Well\u2014 well, goon.\" \"Then, in a solemn voice, he said\u2014 i \" Nay, my darling, have nothing to do with her, I beg off you.

He rose and paced the old kitchen to and fro, and as he did so, he felt that he would have admired Whilelmina just a little more if she had said something kind and cheering to poor Vanderdecken. 'Whilelmina Von Straken, child, I will not force you to be mine, nor will I ' | fraudulently hold your fair hand in I mine as a wife.

Von Straken answered by a sonor- ous grunt. \" Well, I must awaken him, for come what may, I will not be disappointed to-morrow, and there is no knowing but that if the ceremony is de- layed, the old man may fancy himself slighted, and make some objection. Mynheer Von Straken ?\" The merchant only snored again. \" Mynheer ! Confound it, he won't awaken. Ah! I have it. I will put out his pipe \u2014 that will rouse him up.\" Now, Von Straken had just been in- dulging himself with a glass of schnops, in its most genuine condition, and the very air of the apartment was impreg- nated by the vapour of the powerful spirit, as it stood in a little quaint- looking jug before the merchant. \" I have an idea,\" said Wurtem Carlis ; and then, rather heedlessly, he poured from the little jug some of ' the schnops into the huge bowl of Von Straken's pipe, expecting, without rea- soning much upon the subject, to put it out. \" Come \u2014 come,\" added Wurtem. \" I can bear anything but your tears.\" \" You think I have been cold and unkind, when I ought to have been kind ?\" \" No, in truth, and indeed, I do not, so we will say no more of this Vander decken ; but if the rest of the world abuse him, we will think kindly of him.\" \"Yes, oh, yes.\" \"Well, and now, when shall the happy day come when you will be mine, past the power of any evil fortune to affect your choice ?\" \" Did you say to-morrow ?\" \"To be sure 1 did.\" \" Well, I \u2014 thought you did ; and so, Wurtem, let it be so.\" \" My darling, I will go and tell your father at once. And where shall the ceremony be performed, Whilelmina ?\" \" At the church of St. Nicholas ; and this time, I don't think, Wurtem, that they will see me go away without a husband.\" \" I will stake my life upon it they will not. If I am alive, Whilelmina, I will marry you to-morrow at twelve o'clock at the old church of St. Nicho las ; and now, as the time is, thank Heaven, so short, I will be off at once, and give notice to the old clerk to get all in readiness, and by the promise of a double fee, I'll warrant we shall find everything as well prepared for us as though we gave a month's notice.\" \" Farewell, dear AVurtem.\" There was another embrace, and we are quite afraid to say how many kisses ; but we think somewhere about half a gross, and the young lovers parted : AArhilelmina to ponder over the dress she intended to wear, and Wur tem to tell ATon Straken of the arrange ment they had come to. The strong spirit in a moment ignited, and a bright wavy-looking blue flame shot up out of the bowl of the pipe about half a foot in height, while the blue film of smoke from the corner of the merchant's mouth suddenly stopped. Von Straken opened his great eyes, and looked at the bowl of his pipe. They looked, for once in a way, great eyes, owing to the amazing width that he opened them. \" Meine Got, ter tefilin the pipe !\" \"Mynheer, it is only me,\" said Wurtem. Crack ! went the bowl of the pipe into a thousand pieces ; and old Von Straken gave such a lurch backwards, that over went the chair, and he rolled into a remote corner of the room, where he lay with his mouth wide open, look- ing the very image of Dutch agony\" and despair. \" I had better not stay,\" thought Wurtem, \" for any interference with his pipe, I know, makes Von Straken des perate. I will call again in an hour, and I can easily persuade him that I had \"My dear sir,\" cried Wurtem, \"AVhilelmina has consented to be mine, at the old church of St. Nicholas, at the hour of twelve to-morrow. I hope that has your full sanction and ap proval ?\" _ Von Straken was fast asleep with his pipe in his mouth ; but as a Dutch man can smoke very well in his sleep, a long puff of blue vapour found its way out at the corner of the merchant's"], [217, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 207 nothing to do with the awful appear ance and destruction of his pipe.\" Wurtem then thought that his best plan would be to complete the mystifi cation of the merchant, so that he should have such a tale to tell, that it would seem quite out of the question that he, AVurtem, could have been an actor in it. which is, after all, rather to state what did happen, than to search for the causes in the subtle and hidden feel ings of mankind. Well, then, Wurtem called upon the sacristan, and settled everything for the wedding satisfactorily, and then he called upon the most fashionable tailor in all Amsterdam, and in quite a flur ried manner, cried out \u2014 \" Can you make a suit by ten o'clock to-morrow ?\" \" Mynheer,\" said the tailor, \" every thing is possible, and it shall be done.\" \" I will astonish him still more,\" said Carlis, and so he did. Suddenly springing upon the table, Wurtem flapped his arms against his sides several times, and then crowed hke a cock in the shrillest accents. This completed the mystification of Von Straken, who merely said, very \u2022faintly\u2014 \" Meine Got, the end of one world.\" Then he shut his eyes, and resigned himself to his fate. Wurtem immediately left the house, and ran off at a great speed to the old sacristan of the church of St. Nicholas, to Jet him know how the fair Whilel- mina would come to be married at twelve o'clock on the morrow, and how he, the old sacristan, would get double the usual fee upon the occasion from bins, AVurtem, besides what he might expect from old Von Straken. \"Very well, then let it be of tbe faintest pale blue velvet, trimmed with silver lace.\" \" Mynheer is going to be married ?\" said the tailor, with consummate tact. \"Well\u2014 I\u2014 that is, I am, I think.\" \" Ah, Mynheer knows it ; aud with his figure, and noble expression, he ought to wed the fairest lady in all Amster- dam.\" I \" You need not be particular as toV \u25a0] the cost,\" said Wurtem, upon whom the tailor's flatteries had their effect. | \" A few guilders more or less, provided the 6uit is perfect and beautiful, are of no consequence.\" * Ah, see now, this it is,\" cried the tailor, turning round to his son, with the measure in his hand, \" this it is to deal with those of noble disposition. They do not grudge even the poor tailor his hire; and yet, how many there are who have plenty of gold, but who will be particular, and have every cutting of their cloth, to the detriment of the poor tailor.\" \"No doubt,\" said Wurtem; \"but be quick.\" Upon this, the tailor completed his measure of Carlis, and as it was the custom to pay something that might be guessed to be about the price of the material of which the suit was to be made, Wurtem called for writing ma- terials, and gave the tailor a draft upon Von Rotter for the amount. CHAPTER LXI. WURTEM AND WHILELMINA FIND THAT TRUCHDEN IS REALLY VERY CLEVER INDEED, Wurtem Carlis soon forgot how he had left Mynheer Von Straken, \u25a0 his worthy and respectable father-in-law I that was to be, in so very uncomfortable a situation. His mind was so very j full of personal congratulations re garding the ceremony which was to take place on the morrow, and whieh was to make the fair Whilelmina his, past the power of any accident to wrest ner from him. We are afraid, after all, that men are very Selfish beings indeed, and that the passion, or seeling, call it what you will, which has excited the admiration of poets and the plaudits of mankind from the earliest ages, is but an elaboration of egotism, vanity, and selfishness. But that is not to our purpose, \"An order upon the bank of the great Von Rotter ?\" said the tailor, as he bowed with additional respect to his customer. \" Yes, he has funds of mine.\" \" No doubt, Mynheer, no doubt. And where shall we send the suit ?\""], [218, "VANDERDECKEN. 208 \"To Mynheer Von Stiaken's.\" \"Ah, the highly-respectable Von Straken.

AVhy should it be a secret ? I don't care if all the world knew of it.

I don't.\" AVith this, AArurtem rushed out of the tailor's shop, not very clear in his own mind whether he had been made a fool of by the flatteries that had been lavished upon him or not. \"Plague take the shop!\" he said. \" I won't go into it again. I hate the fellow's smooth, hypocritical way. I am sony I did not employ some poor man, to whom the job would have done some good ; but it can't be helped now. It is done, and it don't much matter, after all.\" \" Ah, Mynheer,\" said Von Rotter, when he saw him. \" Take a seat. Ah ! How goes the world with you i\" ' 'Pretty well, Mynheer Von Rotter ; ! and all the better for your good patron- \\ age and advice. Ah, Mynheer, what ' would 1 do without a good man like you to come to now and then in my humble way ?\" \"Ah, my good Mynheer; but you are a man of one thousand, you are ; you have wit and genius.\" \" Oh, no\u2014 no !\" \"Yes, Mynheer; and penetration you have.\" \" Well, I am quite sure that if I have any of those qualities in the world, I owe them all to now and then having the pleasure and the honour of con versing with the great Von Rotter.\" The banker smiled, as he raised his I little fat arm, and added \u2014 \"But perhaps you have something to tell me, my good cousin and friend ?\" \"AVell, do you know one Wurtem Carlis ?\" It did matter, though. No sooner had AVurtem Carlis got fairly out of sight of tbe tailor's shop, than the tailor turned to his son, say ing\u2014 \" Meine son, look to the shop well. I will go at once to our good friend and great patron, Von Rotter, and tell him of this. Who knows but he might like to know of it, meine son ?\" \"Ah, who knows?\" said the son, rubbing his eyes ; for he was rather the worse for a too liberal supply of schnops overnight. AAlth this charitable intent, off went the tailor to A'on Rotter'6 banking house ; but before asking to see the great Von Rotter himself, he tried the effect of Wurtem Carlis's draft at the counter. \" I do.\" \" You will pardon me, I am sure, for taking up your valuable time about such a personage as he is, Mynheer Aron Rotter?\" \" Don't mention that, for it so hap pens that he is the very man of all"], [219, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, TUE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 209 JAN-VAN AND WUR'E- CARLIS ON THEIR SECRET MISSIO] Others in Amsterdam that I am most anx'ous to know something about.\" \"Ah, how happy 1 am, then, to be able to inform you that he is going to be married to-morrow.\" \" Married ?\" \"Yes, to Whilelmina, the daughter of the M rchant Von Straken.\" \" Ah !

Of course, it is 27."], [220, "VANDERDECKEN; OK, 210 Von Rotter beckoned his daughter to him, and she sat upon a little stool at his feet, and for the next half-hour they remained in consultation, the re sult of which will be quite sufficient to show to the reader. Wurtem soon forgot all about the tailor, and went merrily about Amster dam, buying a few trinkets to present to the fair Whilelmina on the morrow ; and, probably, that day may be con sidered to have been the happiest of Wurtem's life, because all was gratified expectation, and because the reality of any joy, be it what it may, is sure to fall considerably short of the anticipa tion, which borrows a thousand glorious hues from the imagination. After some hours, he thought that it behoved him to go back to VonStraken's to see how the old man was ; and any one to observe Wurtem Carlis crossing the threshold with such a look of in nocence as he had would never, for one moment, have imagined it possible that he had poured the schnops into the pipe of the merchant so short a time before. Old Martha met him. \" Oh, Mynheer\u2014 oh\u2014 oh !\" \" What is the matter?\" said Wurtem. \" Oh\u2014 oh\u2014 oh 1\" \"Tell me at once, is there anything the matter with Whilelmina? Oh, speak to me, or you will drive me mad.\" \" No, then, it is not she.\" Wurtem drew a long breath of relief, and said \u2014 \"What is it, then, that makes you shake your head so ? I hope nothing has happened to Mynheer Von Straken.\" \" Ah, that's it,\" said the old woman. \" Something has happened to him, in deed.\" Wurtem staggered back, for the idea that fatal consequences might possibly have ensued from the trick he had foolishly played the old man flashed across his mind, and in a voice of con siderable alarm, he cried out\u2014 \"He is not dead?\" \" Oh, no\u2014 no !\" What a relief that negative was to Wurtem Carlis ! It certainly would not have been quite the thing to frighten the father to death one day, and wed the daughter on the next ; besides, the death of Von Straken would, no doubt, good. \"Who ever yet had the hardihood to doubt a draft upon the house of the great Von Rotter?\" \" I didn't mean that. That will do. Good-morning.\" \"But\u2014 but f \" Good-morning, Mynheer.\" \" Shall I make the wedding suit, or shall I \" \" Meine Got ! Mynheer, what care I whether you make the wedding Buit or not ? I am busy now.\" \" I humbly beg your gracious par don, and humbly take my leave.\" The tailor was backing out from the awful presence of the great Von Rotter, when the elegant and sylph-like Truch den arrived at the door with as much speed aa she could make, and the con sequence was that she ran against the tailor as he was bowing, and nearly rolled over his back. \" You wretch ! who are you ?\" said the fair Truchden, as she gave the tailor a poke with a long darning needle that made him jump again. \" Good gracious !\" cried Von Rotter. \"What do you mean, Mynheer? If you want to dance, go home to do it.\" \" Dance ! It's enough to make any body dance.\" \"Get out of the way, then,\" said Truchden. \" Oh, dear ! yes, Miss Truchden ; but don't do that again, I beg of your goodness.\" \"What has she done?\" said Von Rotter. \" I rather think,\" said the tailor, as he rubbed the afflicted part of his anatomy. \" I rather think it must have been a darning needle.\" *'Ah,\" said Von Rotter, rubbing his chin, \"she is as playful as one kitten.\" \"Yes,\" said the tailor, faintly, \"it is very funny.\" Still making horrible faces, and rubbing the hinder portion of his cor porality, the tailor descended the stairs ; and as he went, he uttered curses and maledictions upon Von Rotter and the fair Truchden. \" Ah,\" he muttered, \" only wait till I have made enough to be independent of you, that's all, and then I will play you some trick that shall shake your guilders a bit, old vagabond, that I will.

AVhat have you seen, Mynheer Von Straken ?\" As he asked this question, it was no easy thing for Wurtem Carlis to keep from bursting into a roar of laughter, for he could not but guess very well to what the old man alluded. \" I will teU you. Do you see this pipe ?\" \" I do, certainly.\" \" Well, meine son-in-law, that is not my old pipe that was. This is a new pipe. For twenty-eight years did I smoke my old pipe, and now this is a new one. Ah, think of that.\" \" But where is the old one, Mynheer ? Have you not got it ?\" \" No, it has gone.\" Here Mynheer Von Straken glanced around him very suspiciously, before he would venture to add in a low voice\u2014 \" You mean to teU me, then, that he is mad?\" \" WeU, a little ; but go and speak to him. He has asked for you. You wiU find him in the parlour, with a new pipe ; for he fell down, it seems, and broke his old one all to pieces.\" Wurtem did manage not to laugh, for this about the pipe at once opened his eyes to the whole affair. No doubt, the old merchant had been giving an account of the awful manner in which his pipe had exploded, and the terrible apparition that then had appeared upon the table ; and all that it was that had made Martha think that her master was out of his mind. \" Meine old pipe has gone to one devil.\" CHAPTER LXII. WURTEM CARLIS INSPIRES VON STRAKEN WITH FRESH CON- FIDENCE. When the old merchant said this, Wurtem Carlis appeared to be very much shocked and surprised at the proceeding, and putting on an air of great sincerity, he said \u2014 \"Mynheer, I am exceedingly anxious to know how such a catastrophe could have happened, and I hope that you will have the goodness to tell me aU about it.\" \"Thank Heaven! it is no worse,\" thought Wurtem, as he crossed the threshold of the room in which Von Straken was. There sat the old merchant in his usual chair, and when he saw Wurtem, he slowly took the pipe from his mouth, and pointed with the stem of it to an opposite chair, and gave a sort of grunt, which Wurtem understood to mean, \" Be seated,\" and he sat down accord inSh'- . . ,,\u201e \" I wdl \u2014 I will. Listen to me, meine son-in-law that is to be, and you wdl hear a dreadful tale. Ah, I was sitting here, smoking meine old pipe, arid thinking of nothing at aU.\" \" Were you awake. Mynheer ?\" \"Awake? Was I awake? To be sure 1 was. I should like to see the person who would tell me I was not awake,\" \"So should I,\" said Wurten Carlis. \" My dear sir, old Martha will have it that you are rather indisposed. I hope that she is very much mistaken ?\" \" Ah\u2014 oh !\" \" You don't look at all ill, sir ; on the contrary, I have seldom seen you look better than you do now.\" \"Ah\u2014 oh!\" \" Really, Mynheer, you distress me very much.

At last he said, with a puzzled look \u2014 \" Well, perhaps it is so.\" \" I feel confident it is,\" said Wurtem, as he adroitly took a piece of tobacco from his pocket, that he had edged off the table, while Von Straken wae speaking, without the old man know- ing it. \" Now, look at this.\" \" I do ; it looks good.\" \" And yet it is adulterated.\" \" You don't say so ? Hand me the schnops, my son-in-law that is to be, The idea of anybody adulterating oui tobacco, gives me one pain in the insid< of me.\" Wurtem poured himself out a glass of schnops ; but the old merchant drank it out of the wooden measure, and while he was so occupied, Wurten con- trived, quite unobserved by him, to soak the bit of tobacco he had in the glass before him. \" Are you better, Mynheer ?\" said Wurtem. \" Well, I think I am a little better. But only to think of adulterating to- bacco ! Couldn't they adulterate any- thing else, I wonder ? They might as well set to work and adulterate the air.\" \" So they might, Mynheer, and so they will some day, if they can get any- thing for it. But now, this bit of tobacco is adulterated, and I will just show you the effect of it. I will put it in your pipe on the top of the lighted tobacco which you have, and which is pure, I dare say, and then \u2014 \" \"Stop, meine Got, no !\" \" Nay, I hope you will allow me to do so, as it will prove to you at once that you can always tell when you are smoking good tobacco.\" \" Well, if I thought that little blue fiend would do no harm, meine Got, I should like to see him again.\" \" There, then,\" said Wurtem, as he placed the tobacco that had been soaked in the strong schnops in the old man's pipe. \"There, then, we shall soon see if he will make his appearance to us.\" The old man was rather in a fright at what might ensue, and taking the pipe from his mouth, he looked at the bowl of it in silence. All was still. and he dances on the top ot the hot tobacco, and he says\u2014' Well, Mynheer Von Straken, how do you find your- self to-day ?' \u2014 You may guess, my son- in-law that is to be, that I was rather astounded at this.\" \"I should think you were, Myn- heer.\" \"Well after looking at him for a time, I said \u2014 ' I am pretty well ; how are you ?' ' Ob,' he said, ' I'm all right. I'm the tobacco sprite. Here I am, all blue, and full of fire.' ' Well,' said I, ' what's your name ?' ' Tricksy Wicksy,' says he. ' Well,' said I, ' I hope we are good friends ?' ' Pretty well,' says he, and then, at that moment, away flew my pipe into a thousand pieces, and I fell into the corner over there.\" \" You don't say so ?\" \" Yes, I do, meine Got, I do say so ; but that is not all \u2014 oh, dear no, that is not all. If that had been all, it would not have been much; but it is not all.\" \" Did the sprite follow you ?\" \"No; but suddenly upon this very table \u2014 the table, meine son-in- law, that you are now leaning your arm upon \u2014 there appeared an enormous animal like a cock, and it crowed dreadfully, so that the very house shook ; and then I became quite insen- sible, and saw no more.\" \"Are you sure it was a cock ?\" \" Sure, am I ? Did I not see it, with its wings, and its comb ? Sure, indeed ! To be sure I am. I saw it.

Ah, me ! I am getting old, and folks say my mind has been given up to the making of money and to drinking ; but I love my child WhUel mina for all that.\" \" How are you ?\" said Wurtem, in a thin, little, squeaking voice. \" The saints have mercy upon us !\" ejaculated Von Straken. \" Don't be frightened at me,\" said Wurtem, in the same little voice. \" Good luck to you, Von Straken, and your son-in-law, Carlis. Good-bye, I'm glad to see you looking so well. You wdl live long, and die rich and happy.\" Out went the little light without breaking the bowl of the pipe, and old Von Straken dropped on to his knees on the floor, saying\u2014 \" Oh, meine son-in-law that is to be to-morrow, did you hear that ?\" \" I did,\" said Wurtem, in his natu rally, rather deep voice ; \" but I don't see anything to be alarmed at. The little sprite was as friendly as he could possibly be to us.\" \" Meine Got, yes, he was ; but if I was to tell anybody this upon 'Change, do you think he would believe it ?\" \" Well, perhaps not. There are people in the world who believe nothing.\" \" True ; and yet you heard it ?\" \" I did, and saw it too. What did it look like to you, Mynheer ?\" \" A little fellow in blue, with a long blue feather in his cap and boots.\" \" Just so, that's what he seemed to be ; but, at all events, there is no cause for alarm, for, you see, it is a friendly spirit, and says that you are to live long, and die rich and happy.\" \" So he did.\" \"Therefore, you ought to feel as comfortable as possible.\" \"So I will. Take another drop of schnops. Meine Got, live long, and die rich and happy. AVell, that is some thing and I do feel more comfortable than I did, no doubt. Meine Got, who would have thought that, now.

Von Straken at last dashed the tears from his eyes, and exclaiming \u2014 \" Pol el\" he took a good draught of the schnops, and filling his pipe again, he composed himself to sleep. Wurtem Carlis had been very much affected at what old Von Straken had said. Well he knew the innate selfish ness of the old man's character, but it interested him to see how that one bright spot shone out from it, like a star alone in a murky sky \u2014 that star of feeling, which showed that he did really and truly love his child. Well, it is something to find that there is some one feeling in the avaricious, which shows that humanity, with all its failings, is yet a reflex of divinity, and that if you look for it, you will find that touch of nature, which \u2014 \" Makes the whole world kin.\" It was not likely Wurtem Carlis would leave the house of Von Straken again without making an attempt to see AVhilelmina. Indeed, the enamoured young man would, if such a course had been at all admissible, have gladly remained there altogether, until it was time on the morrow to go to the church of St. Nicholas.

[ That condition would have consisted in his sitting with the old merchant aU i night long, smoking pipes of tobacco, and drinking schnops. Was it possible that Wurtem could endure even the thought of such a martyrdom ? Ah, no. After leaving the old man to the reflections which the little blue fiend of \" Yes,\" squeaked out a third ; \" and see a good deal of company, and invite all the single young men, so that we may have a good chance of getting a husband ; for it is only, of course, at the houses of the married ladies that we can have any chance at all.\" \" To be sure,\" cried some half dozen all in a breath ; and then Wurtem heard WhUelmina say \u2014 \" Yes, that's all very well, but you know quite well that I must do as Wurtem Carlis wishes in all things.\" A shrill scream of laughter welcomed this opinion, and one cried out \u2014 \" Hoity-toity, indeed ! Do as he wishes? I think I see it. No, my dear, you must do no such thing. You must manage him, you know.\" \" Manage him ? How do you mean ?\"* , \" Oh, you must plague his life out still, for the sake not only peace and of quietness, but for the sake of a home at all, he will be glad to give in, and let you have all your own way.

The laughter proceeded from a large room upon that floor, and so, after a little thought, Wurtem crept very cau- I ] tiously to the door of it, and listened. It was very wrong of Wurtem so to j listen; but he had heard, or he fancied he had heard, his own name : pronounced, and that had awakened his curiosity. Placing his ear quite flat against the panel of the old door, he found he i could hear pretty well what was being j said within, especially as those who < were speaking were not at all particular about speaking in a low voice. Some one, in a little screaming kind of voice, was tattling away at a great rate, and Wurtem Carlis heard her say \u2014 \" Now mind, Whilelmina, you must never give in, but go on worry, worry, worry, until you have your own way, or you will not only never be happy yourself, but you will be doing a serious injury to every other girl married or single in Holland.\" \"To be sure,\" said another voice; I \"and you must keep a little private j \" Then you must be having washing going on every day.\" \" To be sure \u2014 quite right,\" said the others. \"And we will all come to town every afternoon, and see how you are getting on.

It wants yet a little time, too, before Truchden \u2014 that dreadful little Truch den \u2014 and her father, the great Von Rotter, can bring to bear their plan\u2014 for they have a plan, be it known \u2014 against Wurtem. And so, in that passing time, while Whilelmina is trying on new dresses, and is deep in the mysteries of the toilette, ami while Wurtem Carlis is wondering how he should get rid of the long weary hours of the night, for he , knows he will not sleep: during that time, then, we will once more carry the reader to the main deck of the Mary-Jane ; no longer the good ship Mary-Jane, as it was wont to he called in the bills of lading, but the sheer hulk, doing battle but faintly with the elements, that seemed to be leagued together for its destruction. It wiU be recollected that the spectre ship \u2014 the vessel of Vander decken, whose wild and fearful cruises had been hitherto confined to the south sea immediately below the Cape of Good Hope, had appeared to the eyes of the bewildered crew and passen gers of the Mary-Jane in the northern latitude to which that ill-fated ship had drifted. . \" I suppose you think we want him ?\" said one. \" No, I don't think that; it would be too absurd.\" \" Absurd, did you say r\" \" Yes, for I feel quite sure that Wur tem Carlis would never have looked at you twice; so you need not say that.\" \" Oh, you Wretch\u2014 you vile conceited Whilelmina ! I teU you what it is : Your husband will soon get tired of you, and then he will go off to the lust en-rust, and drink schnops, and talk about aU sorts of nonsense and politics, with other men, and you will wish yourself dead ; and then when he comes home, you wiU quarrel.\" \"No,\" said Whilelmina. \"The only thing he would do when he came home and found you all here, would be to say \u2014 ' Ladies, mind your own affairs : there is the door.'\" \" To be sure I would,\" cried Wurtem, opening the door, and walking into the room. \" Now, ladies, I am quite sure that Whilelmina don't want any more of your very kind advice, and I am equally sure that I don't.\" There was a great scene at this, and in the course of a very few minutes the house was clear, although they made such a clatter in getting away, that poor Von Straken woke, and cried out\u2014 \"Meine Got! is there any more adulterated tobacco coming ?\" Vanderdecken clasped his hands over his face, and uttered one shriek. No doubt, to him the appearance of his vessel in such a latitude was the kneU of all his hopes. And yet, he should have known that he had been absent too long from it, and that such being the case, if he v, 1 1 a upon the surface of the deep it would be sure to follow him. There it was, now and then only tevealed to the agonised sight of the crew and passengers, as long, vivid streaks of lightning lit up the sky and the water. There it was, as at intervals a greenish phosphorescent halo seemed to spead around it, and then to be licked off by the waves, as they lashed over its bulwarks. There its was, in such a stormy sea, and having encoun tered such a gale, with all its sails set, and its flag flying at the gaff, and its streamer at the mast-head. / CHAPTER LXIII.

The spectre ship, at the moment of touching the side of the Mary-Jane, had vanished into the air, On, on ! came the spectre ship, and now the crew of the Mary- Jane seemed to feel that there might be danger, and that, after all, the vessel approaching them in such a guise might have soli dity enough to run them down. With one accord they raised a cry. \" She wiU be upon us\u2014 she will be upon us I\" \" No,\" said Vanderdecken, removing his hands from before his face. \" No, oh, no I Gracious Heaven, that is not the danger I\" On, on ! came the ship, and then the carpenter, who was the boldestman on board since the captain had been swept over the side, sprang upon a bulk -head with a speaking-trumpet in his band, and placing it to his iips, he shouted \u2014 a-\u00bb. \"Shipa-hoi!

The fright almost sobered them. \"And, like the baseless fabric of a vision, Left not a rack behind.\" Double darkness appeared to come over tbe face of the deep, and the Mary- Jane still roUed in the trough of the sea, as she had done before, being only a few inches nearer to destruction. \" It is gone !\" said Vanderdeck en, in a low voice. \" Oh, God, it is gone again ! Why, oh, why was it here ?\" He spoke these words more to him self than aloud, and yet, such was the silence upon the deck, and such the strange and awful lull of the winds, as if the very elements bad paused to aUow that spectre vessel to take its course, that every one beard what he said. Those few words of Vanderdecken appeared to break the speU which the astounding circumstance had cast upon the faculties of the crew, and with one accord they uttered a cry of rage and despair. Vanderdecken looked proudly at them. He knew what they meant, and when the carpenter, who still retained his position on the bulk-head, waved his arm towards Vander decken, and began to speak, the doomed man knew well what he was going to say. She was very round and deep in the stern, with two tiers of cabin windows, and a gaUery, after the most old fashioned build of Dutch merchantmen. Her masts were rather short for the size of her hulk, and the practiced eye of the crew of the Mary-Jane could perceive that in aU the appointments of the vessel, the oldest customs pre vailed. \" Messmates, it is clear now why the Mary-Jane is doomed.\" \"Ay, ay!\" cried the crew. \"We know it now.\" \" What do you think that ship was> that came over us like a puff of wind, when it ought to have cut us in two !\" \"The Flying Dutchman!\" cried a voice, and then every one took up the cry, and the words echoed from one end of the deck to the other. There was not many minutes in which to make these observations, and then they all utterred one shout of terror as the huge, old-fashioned ship went right over the Mary-Jane. Where was the crash r Where was \"Yes,\" added the carpenter, \"that's about it.

Vanderdecken folded his arms, and [ looked calmly upon them, and in the strange fire of his eyes, even the boldest seemed to see a something that appalled them. \" So,\" said Vanderdecken, \" you would take the life of a passenger, because a storm has racked the timbers of your ship?

Mr. Holford, who was, like his daughter, quite sceptical con cerning the protested powers of A'anderdecken. \" Indeed ! and are you men ?\" \"Throw him into the sea! Who has any fire-arms ? Shoot him ! Fling a handspike at his head !\" \"And you are English seamen, are you?\" said Vanderdecken. \" Down with him ! Over with him !\" They made a rush forward ; but at that moment Flora Holford dashed open the door of the round house, and flung herself before them. They paused on the instant, and seem paralyzed by the sudden appearance.

Now, mind, if you don't tell the truth, I mean to put this knife into you.\" \"Ob, lor! What do you think of him ?\" SHOWS HOW VANDERDECKEN SAVED FLORA AND HER FATHER FROM THE WRECK. After settling for a few moments in the water upon quite an even keel, and seeming as though it were perfectly stationary, the Mary-Jane heeled over to larboard, and then righting again for about the space of time it might take to count six moderately quick, down it went with a plunge, bow fore most. There was a shriek \u2014 a rush of water \u2014 several explosions of pent up air in the cabins, and then nothing of that once good ship was upon the surface of that tempestuous ocean, but a few floating spars, that came up from the whirlpool that had been created by the sinking of such a large mass as the hull of the ship into the deep water. From the moment that the Mary- Jane sunk, there was an evident cnange in the weather, for the sea became smother, and the wind swept not so close to the surface of the waves as it had done, but moaned and battled in the upper air. In the eastern sky a long line of yellow light was now plainly visible. And now, after having been sucked down to the bottom of the sea. almost along with the hull of the vessel, there to the surface of the water, the rose u > two rafts, upon one of which weie Tom \" AVhy, we take him to be A'ander decken the Flying Dutchman.\" \"Very good, that's just my opinion.\" \"Oh, it is, is it?\" \" To be sure, my good fellow, any thing you like.

Dashing the spray from before his eyes, and fastening back the long hair that, by floating upon the water, tended to obscure his vision, Vanderdecken now, with two or three ingenious strokes of his right arm, gained the side of the raft to which Flora and her father were attached, and pushing it before him, he swaa in a directly easterly direction at a great rate. There then arose a shout along the surface of the water, and a loud, shriek ing voice cried \u2014 \"A boat!\u2014 a boat! A wherry\u2014 a punt \u2014 a anything ! Oh, dear\u2014 oh, dear!\" It was Tom Simpson who raised that cry; but Vanderdecken heeded him not. He had done what he could for him and Mrs. Bell, and he could do no more. Some passing vessel might pick them up, and that was their only chance, now, of life. It was not a bad one, though, for they were just in the track of many trading ves sels, and the morning light was each moment growing stronger over the face of the deep. \" Thank Heaven !\" she exclaimed. \" Oh, father, I do think that even now we shall be saved !\" \" We will hope, dear one.\" \" You speak cheerly, father ; you are \u25a0 - more composed, more yourself, than \" when you were on board that fatal ship.\" \" 1 am, my child, I am.

It would have been quite out of the question for any man with ordinary powers only to swim that distance, and propel a raft before him, after such a long night of fatigue and privation as that which had just passed ; but the reader knows that Vander decken had a charmed life, and that to him to sport with the billows was nothing. \"They wiU be saved!\" he said. \" They are not dead.\" By pressing his weight upon the end of the raft away from the shore, he manage I to raise the other end, where the heads of those whom he wished to save were situated, somewhat out of the water, so that the waves which washed on the lit! le raft did not often come over their faces, and they were able to breathe freely enough, after re covering from the first frightful shock \"What is riiat Flora?\" \" It is the but too probable fate of him who tied us to \u2014 to this raft, and who, by so doing, has saved us ; for even now I see the shore. Alas, father, I fear that he has perished !\" \" Heaven help him!'' said Mr. Hol ford. \" I am here,\" said Vanderdecken \u2014 \" I have not deserted you.

Are you well and able, sir, to continue this great exertion ?\" As they reached the beach, they saw a venerable man, who came a few steps into the water to greet them. His dress and manner at once bespoke his sacred profession : he was the pastor of that wild district. \" Oh, yes, quite so.\" \" Otherwise, I would say, leave us, and save yourself, as the shore is so close at hand. You might be able to send us some succour when you are safe yourself.\" \"No,\" said Vandei decken, \" I have sworn to save you, and I will keep my word. There is no danger now ; and the only inconveniences you will be subjected to, will be in getting through the surf. We are on the coast of Den mark.\" \" Thank Heaven, my children,\" he said, \" that you are saved from death. Come with me ; I perceive that you have suffered from shipwreck in the dreadful storm that has raged off our coast during the night.\" \" It is so, holy sir,\" said Mr. Holford. \" This is my daughter, and this the noble soul to whom we both owe our lives.\" \" You are welcome, all,\" said the old priest. \" 1 pray you lean upon my arm, sir. Come to my house ; it is upon the height, but there is a winding path will take you to it with ease.* Mr. Holford, by the aid of the good pastor's arm, reeled across the sandy beach, and Vanderdecken carried Flora as though she had been as light as an infant. Tbe bouse of the clergyman in such a place as that was but an humble one as regarded appearance ; but it was full of substantial comfort, and Flora was given into the care of the old female domestic of the household, while the priest sent a messenger to a town some miles off for a physician of repute who was there staying. Mr. Holford was accommodated with a bed ; but when the good pastor came back from seeing him comfortably be stowed to the apartment where he had left ATanderdecken, that mysterious personage was gone. * * * * \" We shall be saved, even from the surf,\" said Flora, \" for there are boats even now putting off to meet us.\" From the position he had occupied at the back of the raft, Vanderdecken had not been able to see what was going on upon the shore; but upon this an nouncement from Flora, he raised him self in the water, and then he saw a couple of fishing boats coming towards tbe raft, rowed by six stout men in each, and cuttiDg through the water at great speed. \" We are saved !\" cried Mr. Holford, \" we are saved ! Oh, my child, is not this a joyous moment ?\" Flora could only weep now, and when the boat came alongside the raft, she intimated by signs that it was Vanderdecken she would have first at tended to ; but there was no occasion for any such preference, as, without showing the least symptoms of fatigue, he began to assist the fishermen in un loosing from the raft Flora and her softer. It is now evening \u2014 the evening of the day upon which Flora and her father and Vanderdecken reached the house of the good pastor on the coast of Denmark. The sun has just sunk in the west, below a sea that lies calm and silent as a summer's lake. Not the slightest \" This is a queer craft to go to sea in,\" said one of the fishermen. \" We have come to land upon it, my friend,\" said Vanderdecken; \"our ship is at the bottom of the ocean.\" Flora fainted when she got fairly"], [232, "222 VANDERDECKEN; OK, breath of air stirs the tall grass upon the verge of a mighty cliff, which to the northward shuts in the little bay into which Vanderdecken had guided the raft. lives ? In all confidence, then, in one to whom she owed so much, she was there, according to his request. To the south there are rocks, but none of any magnitude ; and the coast, although broken and dangerous, pos sesses none of the gigantic features that the northern shore does. CHAPTER LXV. FLORA believes nothing, and TAKES THE CURSE FROM VANDER- DECKEN. This cliff to which we allude is about one hundred and sixty feet above the level of the sea, which dashes against its base, throwing up the soft seething spray some thirty or forty feet along its time-worn face. \"I am here,\" said Flora, in a low soft voice. \" My father is sleeping serenely at the pastor's house, and I am here, according to your wish and my promise.\" Vanderdecken was too agitated to reply to her for some few seconds, and then commanding his feelings as well as he could, he spoke in a deep, strange tone \u2014 The top of the cliff beetles over some what, so that it is a fearful thing to stand there when the tide is high, and when a storm, perchance, is lashing the billows, and look down into the raging turmoil so far down below. \" I owe you much for this kindness, maiden. They who would meet me here are not many ; but 1 have that to say to you which may make you fly from me with loathing.\" \" Oh, no, I cannot think that.\" But upon this evening the scene is one of so much serenity and beauty, and the sea is so calm, that, although the contemplation of it from such a height is of itself a nervous and ditzy thing even to think of, yet it is not so positively fearful as at stormier sea sons. \"We shall see,\" added Vander decken, sadly. \" I hope that all the gentle feelings and charities of your dis position will array themselves in my favour. 1 know that they will, Miss Fiora. And now I ought not to keep you in suspense, but lo tell you why it is I sought an interview with you here, apart from all obtrusive eyes and all ears that might drink in the stupendous secret of my discourse.\" Flora trembled at these words. She dreaded what they might be the pie lude to, and she could only say \u2014 \" Suspense is worse than any truth. Tell me, at once, ray preserver, what you have determined to say to me.\" \" 1 will do so Have you heard the wild legend of Vanderdecken P\" \" she man whom they call the Fly ing Dutchman?\" \" The same.\" There are two figures on the summit of that cliff, but they are not near to its edge. A strip of sandy verdure of about twenty feet or so in width is be tween them and that fearful, sharp, well defined edge of the cliff, from which no mortal brain could btar the prospect for many moments, and still preserve its equanimity. One of the figures on the cliff-top is that of a tall man, attired in rich gar ments, which now and then could be caught sight of through the folds of a large cloak that he wore. The other figure was that of a young and beautiful female. Need we say that these two figures were Van derdecken and Flora Holford ? Completely recovered from the ex haustion which her terrors on board the Mary-Jane, and the perilous escape on the raft had produced. Flora had consented to meet Vamlerdecken upon the cliff, as he had told her he had something of moment to say to her. How could she refuse so apparently simple a request from one to whom both she and her father owed their \" 1 have heard, that for a rash vow spoken in a moment of irritation, he and all his crew were condemned to live lor ever, anl that no port would re ceive the ph mtom ship. 1 may farly o\u00abn that unti last night I had no be lief in the story.'' \" But you saw the phantom ship, and that was a confirmation that you could not doubt.\""], [233, "THE ELYING DUTCHMAN. 223 \" It is true, I not doubt it.

Does no limit to your sufferings present itself to you ?\" \" Yes, Flora, it is of that hope and of that possible limit to the sufferings of myself and crew that I would speak to you. It is to tell you upon what terms the ghastly spectre ship, with it3 crew of spectres, may find rest that I have asked you to meet me in this place.\" \" Tell me all, I beseech you.\" \" I dread to do so.\" Flora shrunk back a pace or two from him, and at that moment a long line of reflectant light that had been lighting up the horizon of water disap peared, and a palpable darkness fell upon the scene. \" Ah ! now you shrink aghast from companionship with such a wretch as I am,\" said Vanderdecken. \" You des pise, as well as loathe me.\" \" Oh, no \u2014 no. Say not that. It is not so. I have but one sentiment for you, and that is pity.\" \" Do you, indeed, now, knowing who and what I am, pity me?\" \" I do, as Heaven is my judge ! Surely the penalty of your rashness has been paid ere now. You have suffered enough.\" \" Heaven and its ministers,\" said Van- derdecken, \" ihink not with you upon that point. Oh, would there were mercy sufficient for me ! But I do not repine; oh, no \u2014 no ! Grievous I know was my sin, and grievous must be my punishment.\" The tone of voice in which poor Vanderdecken spoke was one of mingled contrition and dread ; real contrition for the past, and dread lest by any repin- ing upon his part he should arouse the punishment that in his heart he really thought far exceeded the offence. It was impossible but that Flora should be deeply affected at his melancholy position. After a brief pause she ad- vanced closer to him, for she felt ashamed of the momentary dread with which she had regarded him. \" Do not despair,\" she said. \" There must be some purpose in all tat has resulted from your -in. Believe, unhappy spirit, that you are in the hanus us a Providence that does n ithi ng in vain.\" \"I will believe so.\" \" Oh, do not dread it.

Truly, the very expression of the young bride's countenance was different now to what it had been upon her last visit to that ancient church. Any one could now see that her heart came with her, figuratively speaking, while before it was flittering over the good city of Amsterdam in search of one \u2014 Wurtem Carlis. CHAPTER LXVI, RETURNS TO AMSTERDAM, AND TO WHAT HAPPENED Al WUETEM's WEDDING. Once more we beg the reader's kind company to the good City of Amster dam, where reside those in whose for tunes we are so deeply interested, and who have been so intimately mixed up with the mournful history of Vander decken, for whom we expect, now, that we all have a feeling of kindly pity \u2014 for assuredly even the deep sufferings he has undergone, have not had the effect of obliterating all traces of a nobler spirit. We will say nothing of how early in the morning old Mynheer Von Straken rose, and after only smoking five pipes at least, put on a pair of crimson satin don't-whisperems, and a pompadour coloured velvet coat, with seven yards in the skirts, at the very least. Peace be to him I It will be recollected that Mynheer Von Straken had smiled upon the love of Wurtem Carlis for the fair Yv hilel mina, and it will likewise be recollected how delighted Wurtem was at the thought that after all his disaster \u2014 after all that true love We will say nothing of the new wig that he wore for the occasion, nor of the golden buckles in bis shoes, nor of the usual redness, slightly inclining to purple, of the end of his illustrious nose. \" Which never yet ram smooth,''"], [238, "VANDERDECKEN; OR, 228 when the bridal-train reached it, it wm nearly full. Nor will we detain the reader to state how no less than six bridesmaids dressed Whilelmina in white satin that was as thick as a board, provided the board were thin wove \u2014 of how she wore a wreath of white camellias, wove of Ihe huge pearls which Von Straken gave her to place round her neck. By the-by, the six bridesmaids brought either two or three acquaintances each, eo that there were about twenty females at the wedding. Now, if it had not been for the sacred- character of the place in which they -were all assembled, the crowd when they saw what a nice, plump, little, round, rosy creature the bride was \u2014 would have raised a great shout in honour of her ; but as it was, they didn't. When Wurtem, too, in his glorious wedding-dress, made his appearance, they were all ready to shout out, that of all the young beaux in Amsterdam, he was just the one who in every way was worthy of the blooming bride ; but, as in her case, the sacred cha racter of the old church of St. Nicholas kept them quiet, which, after all, was almost a pity. We may state, too, Mynheer Von Staken's curious satin what-do-you call-'eras produced rather a sensation ; and several elderly ladies and spinsters of a certain age said, that he was a fine man yet, and wondered he did not marry again, some of these days. Surely there was never such a gay and sprightly wedding as that in all Amsterdam! The merry bells of the old church shook the ancient turret with their joyous jingle, and the peo ple outside the church raved and shouted in an exalted kind of way, and Von Staken stood upon the steps, and turning round, said \u2014 \" Meine goot peoples, I will have one cask of schoops open for you all in the square of St. Anthony after the wedding.\" The people were ready to smother Von Straken with their caresses ; but he escaped into the church. \"Meine Got,\" said Von Straken, \" here is one mob of wives for all the bachelors in Amsterdam.\" We don't intend to stay either to say that Wurtem arrived a full hour before he needed to have done so at the merchant's house, along with several young men whom he got to accompany him, and how he was dressed in a very magnificent suit of silver-gray velvet, lashed with white satin, and trimmed with silver lace. He looked amazingly well, did Wur tem, upon that solemn occasion, and seemed perfectly resigned. Then, there was such a wine-drinking. and such a talking, and such a laughing, aod such a crowding, and such \"winks and nods and wreathed smiles\" in the old house before it was time to start for the church, that the young bache lors Wurtem had bought with him felt quite distressed, and seriously resolved to get married as soon as possible, just for the fun of the thing. And then at half past eleven \u2014 the ceremony was to be performed at twelve \u2014 they all set forth ; and old Martha, who was forced to stay at home and mind the house, threw an old shoe after them for luck ; and, no doubt, very lucky it would have been I if it had not hit Mynheer Von Staken I right on the top of the head, as it came whirling from an upper window through the air. \"Meine Got, it rains old shoes !\" Well, it was a pretty sight the old church of St. Nicholas, just then, with all the gay dresses of the wedding guests \u2014 all the bright eyes of the bridesmaids\u2014 all the smiles of all the young bachelors \u2014 all the flowers \u2014 all the perfumes \u2014 all the glitter and all the noise, and all the agitation \u2014 yes, it was a pretty, a pleasant, and a heart-stirring sight to see all that. It is worth a journey from London to Amsterdam, even across the vexed German Ocean, to be present at such a gathering. But now it is nearly twelve o'clock, said Vou Staken. Everybody laughed then, as why, indeed, should they not, at so joyous an affair as a wedding 1 and on they all went, the pride of each other and the admiration of Amsterdam, towards the old church, whither, in advance of them, such a crowd of people rushed, that"], [239, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 229 and out come? the old sacristan from the sacristy, and out comes the clergyman himself, and out comes several other dignitaries of the church ; and the clanging bells are stopped while the ceremony is to go on, for who can hear a word while they go buffeting away at each other at such a rate? or way with the nuptials of Whilelmina and Wurtem Carlis ? Would not one have said, \" Well fate is tired of per secuting the young couple any further, and means to let them be quietly mar ried V To be sure one would. Well, we shall see. The clergyman, according to the established form in such cases, and merely as a matter of form, raised his voice, saying\u2014 \" This man and this maiden have come here to the house of the Almighty to be wedded. Has any one here present anything to urge by way of bar or hinderance to the solemnization of the nuptials ?* All is still \u2014 a profound and pleasant stillness : and then Von Straken ex ecutes a reverence to the clergyman, and says\u2014 \" Meine Got, it was warm.\" The clergyman smiles and bows slightly, and then Von Straken adds \u2014 \" Your reverence will come to one little treat that we shall have after the wedding ?\" \" Y\u00a3s !\" said a loud voice from the body of she old church. \" With pleasure,\" said the old clergy man. \" Are the young and interesting couple ready V \" Yes,\" said Wurtem. \" Oh, no,\" said Whilelmina, \" I feel \u2014rather \u2014 faint.\" CHAPTER LXVII. TRUCHDEN PLAYS A BOLD QAME, AND LOSES IT. \" Don't,\" said Wurtem. Well, upon this, the twenty females get round her, and nearly smother her ; but that brings her to again, and she smiles, and says in quite a low voice, that she supposes it must be, and that, therefore, she too is ready. \" Meine Got,\" said Von Straken. * you have been ready, meine child, any time these two years.\" \" Silence ! silence !\" cried all the bridesmaids. \" How very improper \u2014 Really that is a shocking remark.\" Upon this, Von Straken smiles at Wurtem Carlis, and in the effort to do so, quite knowingly makes up such a curious face, that everybody thinks he is very ill ; but he ain't. Twelve o'clock strikes from the old church clock, and there is quite a flutter of expectation. The bride and the bridegroom take their places \u2014 the com pany are all iprepared to see the cere mony \u2014 the old clergyman has put on h;s spectacles\u2014 the sacristan hascoughed loudly for fear he should wan't to do so during the ceremony, when it would be quite an interruption, so that, having coughed before hand, he can remind himself of that fact, and keep quiet. Now, who would have thought it possible at such a time as that for any thing to interfere in any possible shape It would be quite impossible to de scribe the effect this one word, \" Yes !\" produced upon the bride, the bride groom, and the wedding guests, and the spectators, and the officials of the church. They all seemed for a moment or two as if the pronunciation of that simple affiramtive had had the power of chang ing them all to stone. It was Wurtem who first recovered sufficiently to speak, and laying his hand upon the hilt of bis sword, he cried out in a voice that we are afraid had very little reverence in it for the place he was in \u2014 \" Who dare allege aught that can interrupt a poor youth and a maiden from marrying ? \u2014 Let the liar and slanderer come forward !\" \" Oh Wurtem !\" sobbed Whilelmina. \" Meine Got,\" said Von Straken, \" I shall go off into one swoon !' \" Hold, my children,\" said the old clergyman. \" I command your silence.

Do you think that by such a lame invention as that, I am going to be prevented from giving my hand where my heart is already given V The ladies all raised a shriek of approval of this sentiment, and AVhilelmina fell into Wurtem's arms. \" I object,\" said Von Rotter. \"You?\" cried Wurtem. \"You?\" screamed Whilelmina; \" You ?\" said Von Straken, as he staggered against the rails of the altar. \"Yes, I object.\" \" Who are you ?\" said the clergy - man. \" I appeal to the clergyman,\" said Von Rotter. \" And I must obey the prohibition,\" said the clergyman. \"What!'' cried Wurtem, \" you will not perform the ceremony !* \" My young friend, I dare not.\" Von Rotter nodded. \" Vod Rotter, the banker ! \" cried fifty voices. The clergyman held up both his hands deprecatingly. \"My good and faithful people,\" he said, \" I am hound by the law to pro\u00ab ceed systematically in this business, and so if this person were my own brother, I should have to put to him the usual interroga'ories. Now, Myn heer, who are you ?\" \"Von Rotter, financier, banker, and syndic of Amsterdam.\" \"And your objection?\" \" Is embodied, holy sir, in this docu ment, which one of these learned clerks of the Stadtholders Court will read to you, and which is given under the hand and seal of the stadtholder himself.\" \"But you are all mad. I never in my life promised to marry Truchden. I hate the sight of her. It is false false I say, and she knows it. I have no great opinion of her, but I don't thiqk that even she could face me and hold to such a falsehood.\" The veiled figure that was by the side of Von Rotter lifted the covering from its face, and disclosed little Truch den. Fixing her eyes with a languish ing look upon Wurtem Carlis, she said\u2014 \" Oh, my Wurtem, can you deny me now ?\" The clergyman bowed, and then one of the official personages stepped for ward and unfolded a skin of parchment, with a huge seal appended to it, and in a monotonous voice he read \u2014 \" Deny you ?\" cried Wurtem. \" What do you mean?\" \" Mean, my Wurtem ?\" \" 1 am not your Wurtem !\" \"Oh\u2014 oh!

One small pig must have run between my legs \u2014 Murder! Meine Got!\" The whole church was in confusion now, for Whilelmina, in consequence of missing Truchden, tumbled over Von Straken. It was in vain that the clergy man remonstrated with them all upon the dreadful impiety they were all committing in the church. Nobody paid any attention to him. The wedding guests ran hither and thither \u2014 the alarmed sacristan hid himself behind the altar, and Wurtem was nearly mad with rage and excite ment. \" Ladies \u2014 ladies !\" said the clergy man. \" Why didn't you marry the devil when you had him here a week ago I\" said Truchden. '\u2022 I left him for such a little misshapen bundle of impertinence as you,\" said Whilelmina. \" Ha ! \u2014 ha ! and now you come with your second-hand airs and graces to marry Wurtem Carlis, do you ?\" \" Second-hand, did you say ?\" \" Oh, ves, I did.\" \" Oh, take that !\" \" Murder !

It is all settled ; you will have the husband, or the money, you know.\" \" Of course. Come along.\" Von Rotter and his daughter, and the two official personages, would have left the old church of St. Nicholas rather precipitately, for the latter thought that they had better stick to the party for whom they came to act, as the popular feeling appeared to run rather high in the other direction ; but a most unexpected obstacle presented itself to their egress. The steps of the church were crowded by thestadtholder's guards and officers of state, and the carriage, with its out riders and its eight horses, of the stadtholder himself rattled up to the po tico of the sacred building. V.j.i Rotter rushed back, and trod upon ihe toes of the two official per sonages, as he said \u2014 \" Meine Got, the king !\" \" The king !\" sai I Truchden. \" He will make Wurtem marry me, no doubt.\" '\u2022' But, sir \u2014 reverend sir,\" said Wurtem.\" \" 1 will hear no more.\" Von Rotter smiled. \" My daughter and myself, Reverend Sir,\" he said, \" will set the example of obedience to your orders.

The crowd of wedding guests and others fell back, and, richly attired, with a star of diamonds sparkling upon his breast, the stadtholder himself walked slowly into the old church, with a calm and stately air, and a look of serenity upon his countenance. advancing, and dropping upon one knee \u2014 \" your majesty was pleased to sign a prohibition of a wedding in this church upon the plaint of the most loyal and the humblest of your sub jects.\" *\u25a0 Ah ! we recollect.

THE CONCLUSION. \" Alas, sir ! I am.\" \" You shall have justice. When your father appealed to our chancellor for our royal prohibition of the mar riage to another of the man who had by false promises won your love, we felt so shocked at his duplicity, that we positively determined to inquire into the circumstances.\" TriB sudden and most unexpected appearance of the stadtholder, or king, as he was indifferently called, excited the surprise, but not the dread of any one there present. Strange to say, each party fell into the opinion that, let the kingly presence be owing to what fortunate circumstances it might, it would be propitious to them and their wishes. \" Oh, sir, you ure too good.\" \" Nay, it is you who are too com plimentary.

Where is Schnirpeneck ?\" A shambling-looking man shuffled forward, and stood trembling in every limb before the king. '\" What did I promise thee ?\" said the king. \" My pardon for\u2014 for the forgeries upon the Royal Treasury, along with the great Vou Rotter, if I spoke the truth.\" Old Von Rotter and the little Truch den fully relied upon the king giving increased effect to his own prohibition of the marriage between Wu.-tem Carlis and Whilelmina, while they again had an idea that at the appearance of the monarch, the web of sophistry and villany whicn Von Rotter and the ami able Truchden had tried to weave around them would be broken, and scattered to the winds. Every sound was now hushed as the king walked slowly up the aisle of the church. You might have heard a pin drop, so intense was the stillness ; and when he paused, and said in a low, sweet voice, \" Where is the pastor ?'' the tones reached every ear. \" 1 am here,\" said the clergyman, advancing. \"Well, sir,\" added the king, \"how is this 1 We were passing now to this quarter of our city, and were told that a brawl was taking place beneath the roof of this sacred edifice.\" \" What eUe X' \"Death, if 1 did not.\" Von Rotter fell in a swoon to the \" Alas ! sir \" \" Well, proceed.\" \"Alas, sir, it is nearly true.

How say you. Von Straken, will you give them to your king ?\" \" Meine Got, yes ; and very glad I am that they are in such good hands.\" \" And you actually make a free gift of them to me ?\" \" Meine Got, yes.\" \" Well, I wanted an appropriate present to give to a young friend of mine, and these will just do\" With these words, the king ap- proached Whilelmina, and smiling as he confronted her, he said \u2014 \"Allow your king to wish you all the happiness which he feels sure you deserve to have with the gallant and brave husband ' you 'have chosen, and take these jewels as an earnest of our great regard.\" As he spoke, the king flung the string of rare and exquisite gems round the neck of Whilelmina. \" Oh, sir,\" she said, \" it is such joy for me to hear you .praise my Wurtem. I know that he is good, and kind, and brave.\" \" He is. But Wurtem knows that I have cause to praise him; although the particular circumstances he will see that he had much better keep locked in his own heart.\" Wurtem bowed. \" Meine Got,\" said old Von Straken, \"then the jewels are in the family, after all?\" - \" They are, old friend,\" said the king. '* But what are they worth?\" \" Meine Got\u2014 worth ?\" \" Yes, now, at a guess.\" Old Von Straken spread out his little, fat hands, and counted up a very complicated .um upon his fingers. Then he drew several very mystical characters in the air, and, finally, he said \u2014 \" Meine Got, they are worth twenty thousand guilders.\""], [245, "THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. 235 \" Meine Got, it is one dream,\" said Von Straken, as he flung himself upon the neck of Wurtem. \"You know, I always wanted you to be one husband of Whilelmina, when you were even so poor; and now the old man can die happy, and smoke his pipe for ever afterwards.\" \" Very well. You will draw at your need and convenience on our royal treasury for that amount, Von Straken; and, perhaps, it will be no bad thing if our friend, Wurtem Carlis, com mences his career of usefulness in Amsterdam, by taking the next year's contract for the dykes.\" \" It's a fortune next year,\" said Von Straken, \" because there is a new way of setting to work, at one-third of the expense ; so if yoar majesty please, me and meine son-in-law will make our fortunes out of it, and quickly retire to smoke our pipes at our ease. It can be done, I know, at less than one third the expense it has ever been done before.\" That evening at sunset, a ship in full sail entered the harbour of Amsterdam. It paused in the outer basin, and a figure appeared upon the poop. Stretch ing forth its long, thin arms to the shore, it cried \u2014 \" Pardoned ! \u2014 pardoned ! Death is vouchsafed at last to the afflicted \u2014 death, and an immortality that can know no sorrow !\" The king smiled good-humouredly, and hoped Von Straken would make another fortune out of the transaction ; but hoped such a valuable and indus trious member of his majesty's com munity would not think of retiring. The bystanders were highly amused at the king's facetiousness : for it was notorious to all that Von Straken was just the reverse of active and indus trious ; he had just sufficient ability to amass, by his capital, a pretty good sum of money; his transactions beyond that did not extend further than smoking his pipe, which was his con tinual and inseperable companion. The duty on tobacco alone which he paid to his majesty's treasury annually, was as much as the whole of the income of a moderately extensive trades man. There came a whistling wind, a clap of thundei, and the Bhip went down, hull foremost, and was never seen again. Some skeletons, and a few decayed planks, as rotten as though they had been in the water for two hundred years were the only remnants of Vanderdecken, his crew, and his spectre ship, that were found at the bottom of the harbour. Wurlem Carlis and his fair Whilel mina lived long and happily, and he rose to the highest office in the state, through his own talents and rectitude, and the favour of the king, who was warmly attached to him. Old Von Straken passed the remain der of his days smoking, and sleeping, and drinking schnops, and eating ; but it was believed that the events at the church of St. Nicholas were never very clear to his comprehension, for about six months afterwards he took his pipe out of his mouth, aod looking at Wurtem, who had called to see bim, he said \u2014 \" I suspected that a good deal could be made by it,\" said the king ; \" for Von Rotter wanted the contract above all things. But now let us have this, I trust, happy marriage over.\" Tne old priest was so nervous at the presence of the king, that he could hardly perform the marriage ceremony ; but at leugth he did just manage to get through it, and Whilelmina became the wife of Wurtem Carlis, and was actually and truly given away by the king himself. \" Now,\" said the king, with a smile, as he kissed the bride gallantly, \" I bid you all good-day, and much happiness; but you will let us see you often, Wurtem, and bring your fair bride lo our receptions. Farewell.\" \" Meine son-in-law, how was it P Ah !\" \" flow was what, mynheer?\" \" Meine Got, nothing. I will turn it over in meine mind again, and ask you one other time.\" Mr. Holford and his daughter reached England in health and safety after their perilous shipwreck, and Flora married an officer in the army, who proved a kind and loving husband. The last that was heard of Tom"], [246, "VANDERDECKEN, 236 Simpson was, that he had married an old woman in London, believing that she had a large fortune ; out he found out afterwards that she only had a small annuity, which died with her, so Tom Simpson ran away to Australia, where he writes home word that he hunts the kangaroo ; but it is shrewdly suspected that the kangaroo hunts him now and then. But what a happy thing it is, after all, to think that that poor benighted soul, Vanderdecken, is at rest. Let the proud and the vain of life and all its joys, think how many ages he prayej only for death ; and so, even from the wild legend of Vandbr- DECKF.N, OB THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, may we not extract s moral ?
