It might, in truth, have puzzled much wiser people than these two ladies of the Clanbrassey descent to account for the circumstances which were the subject of their not too friendly consi deration and analysis. It puzzles the present writer, for example, most particularly, whose office it is to make everything clear and pro bable, even in describing what is now prover bially admitted to be so much stranger than the inventions of fiction in her most fantastic moods. It is not difficult, of course, to understand vol. in. 1"], [10, "2 LOVE AT THIRTY-FOUR and explain the movements of human sym pathy in the great business of falling in love, in ordinary cases when the young, the beauti ful, the high-spirited \u2014 the well-dressed, the wealthy merely even, for likes run to likes \u2014 are caught in one another's fascinations. But the explanation becomes difficult when little or nothing of all this appears on the record ; and, on the contrary, the strongest powers of attraction seem to evolve from circumstances of repulse in the relative polarities of the parties. To be sure, Rosanna Clanbrassey's sudden captivation has been partly accounted for previ ously. The excited and yet hungered imagina tion of the unhappy woman \u2014 which, like other misdirected appetites, had turned to prey on garbage \u2014 no sooner discerned its native food than the wing was spread, and the beak strained, soaring upward in pursuit. There were good probabilities in the case, and an impassioned, though long starved and mortified, fancy sup plied all that was needful with Miss Clanbrassey in decking out the chieftain of Pendragon Mohr with the noblest attributes of chivalric manhood"], [11, "AND FORTY-FIVE. 3 and superiority of every kind. Rosanna had intellect to appreciate his, and it turned, with a new-born capability of living absorption and in crement, from the barren leaves of books, to the vivifying warmth and stir of a powerful and original mind in spheres of active movement and research. All her wasted existence hitherto seemed to be restored to her in this sudden discovery of a use and application for those treasured stores of knowledge and information which had been to her hitherto a mere hortus siccus, collected with infinite toil only to mock the investigator with colourless, scentless skele tons of form, and fragrance, and beauty. Truly, for the first time in her life, perhaps, since her destinies had become so disastrously entangled by the counteraction of natural and artificial impulses, set in formidable action in so powerful a framework of passion and intellect, Rosanna Clanbrassey rejoiced that her uncle had taken so much pains to render her unfit to be an ordinary woman, but fit to be the companion and fellow-reasoner of a man of the highest range of understanding and acquirement, like Tredegar Pendragon, Esq., M.P. 1\u20142"], [12, "4 LOVE AT THIRTY- FOUR A passion so little physical in its origin could well bear to overlook the absence of the charms of youth and freshness in the still noble and towering person of that descendant of princes and chiefs of men. And, though Rosanna was not in reality herself old in years \u2014 in spite of the reflections of her sisters, who always forgot how much younger she was than themselves \u2014 but in fatigue and disappointment of heart, and exhaustion of spirits, over labours and pursuits that yielded no joy to her woman's heart or na ture \u2014 the matured age of Mr. Pendragon, and consequent experience of the world and its usages which marked all he said, if not all he did, seemed only to present additional claims to her admiration and homage. But it is comparatively easy to account for a woman's fascination in most cases, especially a secluded and neglected one like Rosanna Clan brassey, in all that appertained to the emotions now awakened in her heart, when for the first time, it seemed to her, she stirred reciprocal feelings in the breast of a high-born gentleman, and equal in all respects. Too late, indeed ! too late. But that direful conviction itself acted as"], [13, "5 AND FORTY-FIVE. the spell of the forbidden and dangerous always has acted upon the human race since Eve felt the mysterious attractions of the fruit which brought Sin and Death into the world; heightened \u2014 perhaps caused \u2014 by its prohibition ! But that the fastidious, memory-devoted Tre degar Pendragon should almost as suddenly re ciprocate that profound interest \u2014 that sentiment of attraction and tender dedication which had made a new woman of Rosanna Clanbrassey \u2014 almost visibly transfigured her coarser linea ments even to the eye ? It is strange, but it is true ! Had Rosanna Clanbrassey been a womnn of the finest imaginable feminine attributes ; had her face and figure boasted an exquisitely delicate feminine character ; her mind the cowering fe minine weakness, submission, and all-trusting ness of the lovely woman who had been the angel of Mr. Pendragon's youth, and was still the glorified vision overhanging all his past ; it is probable he would have turned away, with the heart's natural impatience and weariness of the repetition of its experience, from the fascinations of the new charmer. He had turned away thus"], [14, "6 LOVE AT THIRTY-FOUR from the fairest mocking representations of his departed seraph in the flesh, and preserved in preference a constancy to her marble similacrum on a tomb. To love for the second time, with any revivication of primal powers, in truth, you must start afresh by loving the reverse of what you have already exhausted one range of sym pathies and sensibilities upon. Aud so, per chance, it happened that, as soon as he began to look upon her in any feminine light at all, Mr. Pendragon's feelings and interest were more aroused and riveted by the strong-minded, large limbed, brooding, learned, mysterious, ugly, sallow woman that offered herself to his notice and regards, than they could have been by the most finished and matchless Psyche creation might present him in exchange for the one he had lost. Only a contrast so complete could have struck with so much force on the monotony of Mr. Pendragon's regrets, and reversed the general action of his mind towards female pretendants to notice in it. Moreover, there was so strange a mixture of rough-and-ready gravitation of emo tions towards himself in the strong woman's"], [15, "AND FORTY-FIVE. 7 exhibitions, restrained by such visible counter active energies of an unknown nature, that Mr. Pendragon was at once flattered and startled into unusual attention by the phenomena. There was nothing of womanish contrivance or coquetry, he could perceive very clearly, in these strangely varying moods of the masculine mind and sternly-disciplined heart thus exposed to his analysis. And he felt himself engaged in the study by all the tormenting and yet fascinating attraction of a problem or rebus, whose solution was, besides, full of a flattering promise and interest to himself personally. To these motives of curiosity and philosophical research may be added as much of the more worldly and vanity-tangled feelings ascribed to him by the Countess and her sister in their conversation, as could form part in the com position of a gentleman of high integrity and those stately principles of honour that governed Mr. Pendragon in all the relations of life. No doubt he had grown to feel excessively anxious as to the realities of the position in which him self and his property were now involved, and would have been happy to find some anchorage"], [16, "8 LOVE AT THIRTY-FOUR in his doubts and perplexities. To balance the effects of the tragedy of the returned convict, he certainly felt very desirous to make the ac quaintance of persons whose connexion with those to whom he had trusted his all, and high and honourable position in society, seemed to assure him that he was not going to be miserably taken in. This, at all events, was the reason Mr. Pen dragon assigned to himself for accepting, and continuing to lay stress upon, Miss Clanbrassey's invitation to Featherstone Haugh, at a time when his own immediate business in Liverpool seemed brought to a satisfactory pause. The shares of the mining company formed on his property had gone up at once to a handsome premium on the Liverpool Exchange, and nothing seemed required but the extension of the works already commenced on a grand scale, and some signs of the good fortune expected to ensue, to establish the whole speculation as a great success. Under these circumstances Miss Clanbrassey's innouncement, at the close of her visit to Liver pool, that she was to return home on the follow-"], [17, "9 AND FORTY-FIVE. ing day, and expression of her hope that Mr. Pendragon would come on the next after that, to allow her the pleasure of introducing two enthusiasts of geological science to each other, was received by that gentleman as a covert form of expressing her wish to go before to make things more comfortable for his reception. He bowed in a gratified manner in consequence ; and he was only taken down a few pegs when Madame de la Mazurka exclaimed, \" Capital, Rosanna ! Mr. Pendragon will, I am sure, not object to a seat in the carriage my sister has kindly placed at my disposal, and taking care of me on a visit to my uncle also ; and we may as well make an appointment together.\" What could he say but that he should have much pleasure in officiating as Madame the Countess's escort on the occasion ? Rosanna noticed, how ever, with grim satisfaction, that he did not seem much pleased with the prospect of the t_te-a-tete. When the \" following day\" came, and Miss Clanbrassey took her departure from Liverpool Palace, it was with the greatest pleasure also that she found Mr. Pendragon made a special"], [18, "10 LOVE AT THIRTY-FOUR. call to pay his farewell compliments. And there was an expression of regret in his countenance, mingled with so much of earnest interest, that the poor haggard \" Solomon in petticoats\" en joyed all the luxurious meditation of a Juliet of sixteen for hours after they had separated, until indeed she soun 1 herself in sight of Feather stone Haugh Hall. And then of a sudden a weight as of a whole atmosphere fell upon her, and she seemed like an overworked steed back ing, after a few insufficient moments of repose, into the dreary shafts again."], [19, "CHAPTER II. FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. Featherstone PIaugh village was not in itself a very cheerful-looking place, or calculated to diminish the effects of any painful associations by its natural charms. It was situated upon the edge of an extensive, almost black-hued sea-moss, which descended to the shores of the Mersey, in alternate wastes of reedy rock and turf and pools of saline putrescency. The village consisted of about thirty homesteads ; with the exception of the parsonage and the manor-house, all of very poor and lowly-looking cottages, built of cobblestones cemented together by mud, and thatched with black pease straw. These dwell ings were scattered in various ins and outs of wretchedly unproductive and uncultivated gar-"], [20, "12 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. dens and orchards, around what was by courtesy denominated the Haugh Green. This was, however, rather a continuation of the dark and marshy moss below, diversified by patches of short, stunted furze, coarse grass, and a whole wilderness of wormwood, as an undergrowth. The very geese that fed upon the common \u2014 it was so wide an unenclosure that it might rather be called one \u2014 were reported in the Liverpool market to partake of the bitterness of this species of natural provision, which they were compelled by starvation to feed upon. So, at least, the malicious wits of the market would have it. Some epicures professed to like them the better on that account, certainly ; but \" bitter as a Haugh goose\" was a Liverpool market proverb. The redeeming points of the scenery lay in land, where, indeed, as soon as the limits of the extensive waste were passed, enclosures and fields began, and lines of villas surrounded by gardens and trees, and glimpses of woodland and carefully-cultured country, speedily rejoiced the eye, and announced the neighbourhood of a great and opulent city. Distant windmills whirled their great arms, and proclaimed the"], [21, "13 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. pleasing fact that barrenness and desolation dwelt not throughout the land, as might have been augured from the immediate aspect of things in Featherstone, since there was occupation for these engines of plenty, though remote. The crowing of cocks, the cackling of geese. and the drowsy murmur of the \" Moss Beck\" \u2014 a stream which traversed the village, yellow and brightly pure as amber, over a narrow rocky bed, till it lost itself, by a score of broken channels, like the sandy mouths of the Rhine, in the sea \u2014 were almost tbe only sounds you ever heard in the Featherstone Haugh on week days. Occasionally, perhaps, the shrill voice of a woman calling to some misdemeaning child \u2014 probably paddling too rashly in the \" Beck\" \u2014 or the slow, apathetic interchange of greeting between two wearied labourers trudging home, might interrupt the stillness. Or, perhaps, I should say, render it, by the contrast, more apparent. It was quite an agricultural village, indeed, the marsh appearing to its inhabitants an insuperable obstacle to their attempting any thing industrial on the broad waves of the estuary so close at hand. Not to mention that"], [22, "14 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. every mile of that watery extent was as carefully mapped and owned, with all imaginable fishing and manorial rights and wrongs, as the barren shore itself. On Sundays there were perhaps some signs of animated existence in the ringing of the bells to church. So the ancient old stone barn with a steeple, that stood in its little place of tomb stones, and swelling green mounds, and imme morial yew trees, at the head of the village, had the face to rate itself. But even these bells could not be prevailed upon \u2014 or else were seldom asked \u2014 to put anything cheerful or life-like in their summons. Strangers almost always inquired whom the bells were tolling for ? On the whole, therefore, the aversion of the vagabond-blooded, semi-Irish Clanbrasseys for their uncle's place of dignified residence, in their youth \u2014 with the exception, it was sup posed, of the more teachable and congenially gloomy Rosanna \u2014 was pretty well accounted for. The ancient manor-house itself partook of all these general characteristics of seclusion and melancholy in no slight degree. It is true it was paled in with a considerable park, which"], [23, "15 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. had been diligently redeemed from the waste, and was pretty well wooded, besides being of a much more diversified and broken ground. But approaching it by its avenue from the village, it seemed situated in the depths of a hollow, only opening on one side to a range of old-fashioned, gloomy garden enclosures and terraces, relapsing, after a descent, into the dreary wastes of the moss, which were in their turn bounded throughout by the sands, or swel ling tides ofthe Mersey. The Hall was like most of the mansions of its era \u2014 three centuries ago \u2014 a modernized re mains of a fortified building, consisting of a low, central tower, and an enclosure of defensible courts, surrounded by a battlemented wall and moat. The moat had been drained, the draw bridge removed, the walls roofed-in up to the \" donjon or keep,\" and pierced with long, formal, lozenge-glazed windows, as chambers adapted to more modern uses, when those of military strength ceased to be of importance. The tower and a good portion of the walls were hung with ivy and creepers, but wherever they appeared presented a grey and crumbling aspect"], [24, "16 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. not altogether reassuring to an arriving guest. The whole place being, besides, shut in by masses of lofty and extremely ancient trees, of which Mr. Featherstone could not fell a single trunk, even if he had been desirous, Feather tone Haugh Hall, it must be allowed, presented a sufficiently weird and shadowy aspect to allow the shapings of some dismal and unhappy inter nal romance to figure itself readily to the vision of a person whose imaginative tendencies might run that way, or whose personal experience might put him on tbe \"Stygian track\" in contemplation. Of latter years, too, the residence and all about it had fallen into very marked neglect and desue tude. The entail, which deprived Mr. Feather stone of all power over its disposal as an inherit ance, indisposed him to any outlay and expenses the fruits of which were to be reaped by a stranger. He desired rather to save all he could. The seclusion he delighted in, or at least would not be troubled to dissipate, and the smallness ofthe family his finally shrank into, with a single favourite niece for a companion, rendered much attendance unnecessary. By far the greater portion of the house was therefore quite unin-"], [25, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 17 habited. Nobody set foot in the tower from year's end to year's end, and what were tra ditionally known as the state chambers were rarely even opened to the light of day, though they contained many curious old pictures and old furniture, which would have been the better for an occasional dusting. The household con sisted of only two ancient maid- servants and one serving-man, who seldom donned his livery, and was now growing so old that the propriety of allowing him a boy to aid him in the rougher work was seriously canvassed by Mr. Feather stone and his niece. But had been so strenu ously remonstrated against by the Scotch bailiff, as a waste of better-devoted wages, that nothing had as yet been done in the matter. In truth, this Scotch bailiff had established, in the course of the two years he had now resided at Featherstone Haugh, a singularly complete and scarcely accountable influence over the entire property and its owner. To be sure, Abednego Blackmore was speedily ascertained to be worthy of all the high praises which had recommended him to Mr. Featherstone's employment, from that of a VOL. III. 2"], [26, "18 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. neighbouring gentleman who had found farming pursuits too expensive for an income which had also to be shared with London ballet-dancers and Newmarket blacklegs. So at least the dis charged bailiff, who had cause to speak his best of so kind and unreckoning a master, was com pelled to declare to his new proprietor was the occasion of his leaving. Nothing of this kind was to be apprehended at Featherstone, and the skilful agriculturist \u2014 such he really was \u2014 had no great difficulty in making his management shine in contrast to that of his predecessors, in all the details of a most indulgently neglected property and tenantry. But it was not only in modern and improved styles of cultivation, routine of crops, drainage, &c, introduced by this capable official to the unwilling executive powers of the laggard vil lagers of Featherstone Haugh, (which, for that matter, might have been styled Sleepy Hollow), that Abednego Blackmore made a new era felt and detested there. He raised the values of the properties he came in contact with by infusing, as much as in him lay, his own spirit of grasp ing rapacity and hardness of economical calcu-"], [27, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 19 lation into their proprietors. Rents were looked into and stretched to their utmost modern capa bilities \u2014 and in good truth, in the case of the Featherstone property, they admitted fairly enough of a wide expansion, since the squires of the Haugh had scarcely increased their re venues since Liverpool first began to boast a steeple. He narrowed or abolished numerous ancient privileges of the tenantry, being perfectly familiar with modern landlord-made laws re straining them. He levied unknown new dues and exactions, and laboured at the reduction or removal of the numbers of persons employed or figuring as paupers on the land, with a zeal that did the highest credit to the maxims of \" Political Economy,\" of which he was an ardent disciple. Not so much, indeed, to the credit of his humanity, perhaps, \u2014 but Abednego Black more was perfectly indifferent on that point. He had been very successful, in particular, in influencing Miss Clanbrassey in the adoption of his views in these ways, and Miss Clanbrassey was now virtually the disposer and controller of all that was done upon her uncle's property. Mr. Featherstone was growing old, and had 2\u20142"], [28, "20 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. always had a bookish and refined love of ease and quiet, which gained upon him. He had lost the habit of mingling much and familiarly among his dependents and neighbours ; he heard with his niece's ears, and saw with her eyes. And he could reasonably apologize to himself for the surrender of his powers and duties into her hands, by remembering that as Rosanna's future provision must depend altogether upon what could be laid up from the estate during his lifetime, the regulation of its affairs had become more her business than his own. Abednego's harsh and rapacious counsels were, moreover, recommended to his superiors by the carneying and obsequious manner in which he introduced them for acceptance, in conjunction with the pitiless logic of expediency and right by which he always laboured to make his most opposed doings of the sort seem results of no other motives or sentiments. He was a man of some education, though altogether self bestowed\u2014a circumstance of which he had seemed proud on his first arrival at Feather stone, when he made no secret to the haughty country gentleman that he was sprung from a"], [29, "21 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. race of poverty-stricken cottars in one of the remotest and most inclement counties of Scot land, and had acquired all his knowledge in the science of agriculture in a long, severe appren ticeship to a native soil, which, under the exer tions and expenditure of its noble owner, had been converted from barren heath and mountain into fruitful corn and grass land, sheltered under growing woods, with its original value multi plied a hundredfold. In the \" booing \" and insinuating styles of \" creeping up a sleeve,\" indeed, Sir Pertinax Macsycophant himself could not have surpassed the slimv crawlings of Abednego Blackmore towards the attainment of his ends. But he was endowed with another quality also greatly conducive to success in a man's own objects. He was attached to his opinions on all subjects \u2014 not alone agricultural \u2014 with an inconceivable obstinacy and stubbornness, and had an un bounded belief in his abilities and resolution to bring anything he undertook to pass. His own elevation in the world \u2014 above all, the ac quirement of wealth \u2014 were to be reckoned un doubtedly among the secret imaginings of the"], [30, "22 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. heart of this man, which, coupled with unscru pulousness as to means, iron nerves, habits of inflexible secrecy and caution in all that con cerned himself, rendered him, though he kept the most exact and carefully-ruled books and ledgers of accounts in the world, rather a dan gerous sort of a steward and general manager, I should say. It was possibly these latter qualities of wed dedness to his own opinions \u2014 -returning to them always, whatever windings round the whole field he might seem to take \u2014 which, after a time, had diminished the great favour and adhesion Miss Clanbrassey was remarked by every one for a long period to have exhibited towards the excel lent servant whose abilities she had secured in her interests, and who had such judicious arts of recommending their relentless carrying out to herself. Or perhaps she grew rather to disrelish certain encroachments to his own advantage, and a species of copartnery he established in the management of the extensive dependencies Mr. Featherstone kept in his own hands, and which the Scotch bailiff was originally engaged to put in order and superintend. At all events, some"], [31, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 23 considerable time before Rosanna's late visit to Liverpool, she had been observed to change not a little in her demeanour towards, and harmo nious action with, the domineering agent. The servants and tenants at the house and on the Home Farm, as it was called, had begun to remark, with much satisfaction to each other, that their \" young lady \" \u2014 as they persisted in styling her \u2014 seemed no longer disposed to such constant and intimate association in the objects and proceedings of the Scotch bailiff as had been long the case previously. She appeared, in fact, rather to shun his society and to dis courage his plans of extending his dominion and rapacities. Occasions even seemed to arise of strong difference of opinion between them, which all the blandishing cajolery of Blackmore's habi tual manner did not prevent, some thought, from running at times even into altercation and direct concussion. Intervals followed as of a sullen species of resentment against ill-usage and igno rant overswaying on the part of the opinionative bailiff \u2014 of scarcely disguised contempt, impa tience, and almost, one might say, revolt and defiance against an usurpation that galled her,"], [32, "24 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. on the part of the lady of Featherstone Hall. Lengthened periods of repulse and alienation evidently took place between the parties, so long protracted at times that good hopes were enter tained of the removal of the unpopular over looker by his employeress's own fiat. But mutual interests probably facilitated reconcilia tions between the agricultural lady and her bailiff, for these hopes had hitherto been always signally baffled when they seemed approaching fruition nighest. Perhaps it was a little remarkable that, on both sides, these discussions and differences were kept carefully concealed from the Squire, who had no great liking for the man himself, and would, it is very possible, have been pleased with an opportunity, presented by any complaint on his niece's part, to be rid of him. Mr. Featherstone's belief in the sustained confidence and patronage of his niece towards her efficient agent was, in fact, the only thing that kept him in decent terms of satisfaction with Blackmore himself. The increase of the rent-roll was not much his concern, and he could not shut his ears altogether to the murmurs and afflictions of"], [33, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 25 his once happy and contented tenantry and de pendents. But no doubt Miss Clanbrassey had grown accustomed to the blarneying flatteries and deference in forms of the hard-headed and hard-hearted agriculturist \u2014 was puzzled how to supply his place, or found him too thoroughly mixed up in the entire condition of her affairs and her uncle's property, to proceed to any summary action in freeing herself from what it is, however, not unlikely she began to look upon as the establishment of an irksome and encroach ing tyranny of control, in the shape of advice. In good truth, if the characteristics of both the personages had not been so utterly opposed to the idea, or if so improbable a scandal could have entered the heads of the feudal -bred villagers of Featherstone, something of the vagaries of the tender passion \u2014 its changeful moods of imperious demand and repulse, of disgust and craving, likely to arise between such an ill-matched pair \u2014 might have entered even their simple minds.

But independently of a thousand other con siderations, even their malice and corruption of conjecture could scarcely have survived the con sideration of the total personal unfittedness of the supposed hero of a pastoral love romance for the post. There could hardly, besides, have been greater contrasts in personal characteristics than the Scotch Corydon and his fancied Chloe presented. Rosanna Clanbrassey was, we know, of most unusual height and development in the framework for a woman. Bailiff Blackmore scarcely reached the middle standard in stature. and was of almost ridiculously mean and shrunken lower proportions in his limbs. These effects were all, no doubt, heightened by a way of stooping at the neck, which Abednego had con tracted rather from the cringing habits of his mind than anv natural malformation. Though, *\u2022 O \u25a0** to be sure, he had a head large out of all propor tion to his frame, and almost perfectly round in the shape \u2014 as could be plainly discerned by its nearly complete baldness, saving some tufts of colourless sandy hair which decorated it at scat tered points. But the features of the face were quite as unusually small and mean to form the"], [35, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 27 centre of such a perimeter; the mouth was thin and strongly compressed, as if to conceal what really seemed like a dentist's box of double-set, wolf-like teeth, when it was allowed any swing of display ; the eyes were puckered up, lurking, and insidiously watchful in no ordinary degree ; otherwise destitute of expression ; and no one could say of what colour they were, if any. Add to all this very high cheek-bones, a blood less, but strongly, one might almost say, plaided complexion, from its weather-beaten diversities of hue, and we have a personage at once in a high degree plebeian, ungainly, and sinister, and not assuredly by any means of the kind to make a proud and well-born gentlewoman forget what was due to herself and her dearest ties and interests by accepting a levelling to. But to complete the picture, it must be said that Abed nego Blackmore was not by any means a young man \u2014 probably nearer fifty than forty \u2014 that he had an habitual asthmatic cough, and that his customary dress was as ill-becoming as his figure. He almost invariably wore a faded green gamekeeper-looking coat, with large metal but tons; corduroy shorts, with high gaiters but-"], [36, "28 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. toned up to the knees ; a Scotch cap, and plaid necktie sufficiently greasy and dirty. And when he donned his Sunday, or market-day suit of ill-cut black broadcloth and chimney hat, he looked less a gentleman than ever. No : it was not surely in all the power of association\u2014 in all the insanity of solitude, and delirious workings of the Celtic blood Rosanna Clanbrassey inherited \u2014 to have brought about so strange a result as a passion between two creatures whose instincts and position seemed to place them at opposite poles of existence and creation ! Could any yet subtler and more powerful fiend have introduced his agency into the w-ork ? We should hope not ; and the most suspicious scrutiny could have discovered little to gratify its queries in the first meeting that took place between the unhappy-visaged Rosanna Clan brassey and the confidential manager, on her return to Featherstone Hall.

But he had a perfect right to be there, inasmuch as he resided close at hand. One of Mr. Featherstone's principal farms \u2014 tbe Home Farm, as it was called \u2014 being in his own hands, he employed five or six men-ser vants, as farm labourers, carters, etc., who resided in an old building which had once been a fortified gateway from the moat, and was consequently not very far from the house. Here also were the principal outbuildings in use for the establishment \u2014 a farmyard, barns, cow houses \u2014 what-not \u2014 useful in the produce and storing of agricultural wealth. And here the bailiff himself resided, in two small rooms over the gateway, which he never suffered anyone to enter \u2014 where he cooked his own frugal meals, read his Bible, chaunted, or, rather, sonorously repeated his psalms on Sunday ; and on week days occupied his little leisure in a great variety of small personal economics, and the study of the bucolic sciences, to which he apparently devoted the master energies of his mind."], [38, "30 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH.

Perhaps the journey has a lit tle tired me to-day, as we were late up at a farewell party at my sister's last night,\" re plied Miss Clanbrassey, who looked certainly extremely annoyed at the scrutiny to which she felt herself subjected from those colourless, yet fixed and hankeringly suspicious orbs of vision. \" How is my uncle ? Is he quite well ?\" \" As well as a man of his age \u2014 and better \u2014 \u2022 can be expected to be, that goes about fashing"], [40, "32 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. himself, and fashing everybody about him, finding fault with a' things that's said, done, or thought in a parish bounds !\" replied the bailiff in tones of exasperation, and, as it were, de fiance and revolt, that struck Rosanna. She looked at him for a moment with all the deep lines of her own visage deepening in sha dow, while its projecting features became of an almost deadly sailowness, as if the circulation dived down to her heart with some internal qualm. Then she averted her eyes with a sort of shudder of pain and vexation from the ple beian figure before her, in contrast, probably, with those other nobly intellectual, chieftain like attributes haunting her memory. \" Where is my uncle, Mr. Blackmore ?\" she inquired after a very slight pause, but during which the postboy on the single horse that drew the hired vehicle she came by, looked back in wonderment for orders, looked still more wonderingly forward for none.

I'll get out here at once, I think, Mr. Blackmore, and the postboy can put up his horse for an hour or two on a good corn-feed, and come up to the house him self for refreshment with my trunk and band box. Ullathorn will help when he comes in to his tea, and it is just that now,\" Miss Clan brassey said, resuming a sort of sternness and resolution in her tones that struck the bailiff rather ominously, and looking steadily from him at her watch as she spoke. But she looked at him with an asperity and indignation in her deeply-sunk and mostly wearied and passion less eyes, that made him start, as she added, \"And you can follow on with me, and you can tell me all the news as we go. How's Mopsy, now ?\" \" Mopsy 's sold ; she fetched just her hide and"], [43, "35 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. horns, and I didn't envy the man that got her his bargain !\" returned the bailiff, in a continued dogged, sullen, and defiant manner. \" And that is another of the right things done about the place that's put the Squire's bear growling, and sets him biting at people like a seal at a stick !\" \" I don't wonder then, Blackmore \u2014 Mr. Blackmore !

Open me the door of the phaeton, will you ? for it is quite plain you will not get that gate undone between now and Christmas !\" \" Shall I help you, old gentleman ?\" said the postboy, nimbly springing from his saddle, and advancing for the purpose. Harmful, though well-meant and inoffensive words on the lad's part ! They produced their effect certainly on Miss Clanbrassey, and not much less so, though in a different way, on the person more immediately addressed. \" No, ye shannot ! ye shannot ! ye young 3 \u2014 2"], [44, "36 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. town-monkey, ye ! Who gave you leave to be so familiar with me, and call me ' old gentle man ?' \" returned Blackmore, quite ferociously, and looking as if he meant to strike the lad if he approached. The postboy paused, and looked in a puzzled, smiling manner at his fare \u2014 \" I think you are all crazy to-day about the place ! Must I open it myself?\" said Rosanna Clanbrassey, violently flinging open the door of her vehicle, in effect, and striding to the ground. \" And now shall I do your work there, too, Blackmore, \u2014 or do you mean to be fumbling on all day at those bars ?\" \" Your pardon, my leddy. I did na' notish the lodge-man had twisted it with wire \u2022 the Squire's horse always goes out by the back way,\" replied the bailiff, seeming to awaken to the consciousness that he was indulging in an unseemly altercation with his mistress. \" There now, you ear-to-ear, grinning young jackal, the stable for you is on that side o' th' yard, and you will find plenty of good wholesome straw to rub your beast down and diet her on after wards.\""], [45, "37 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. \" No, my man ; lead your horse on the other side ; there's better accommodation and feeding there ; and I am the person, I trust, who has the best right in this place to tell you where to go, excepting the master himself. And now, Mr. Blackmore, come along with me, and tell me all the news, to the house.\" Miss Cranbrassey marched her towering person past the figure of the bailiff, which it decidedly overpowered, and who had, besides, sunk now into his habitual cringing attitude, as if cowed by the spirit displayed against his own carping insolence of ill-humour and reluctant service. Then turning with undissembled exasperation from the grinning postboy, who enjoyed the \" old gentleman's\" take-down mightily, he gave a further not very attractive asthmatic cough, and followed on his mistress's steps with a good deal of the mortified submission of a beaten cur. Miss Clanbrassey meanwhile appeared to take no further notice of the annoying circumstances of her arrival, but began almost immediately, in the hearing of the postboy, to observe upon the broken and dangerous condition of the ride to the Hall."], [46, "38 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. \" We must put on men at once \u2014 as many as we can get from the Haugh after work-hours \u2014 to put things in some decent order here.

Does your leddyship expect visitors ?\" inquired Mr. Blackmore, with evident surprise and anxiety. \" Grand visitors, I suppose, from the great town?\" \" The Countess de la Mazurka, my sister, is coming to see her uncle \u2014 she has not seen him for years,\" said Miss Clanbrassey, rather hasten ing her steps to be freed from the intrusive familiarity with which the bailiff followed so closely on them, as he did. \" The Countess de la Mazurka ! \u2014 your sister ! \u2014 the Countess !

Have I not always told you I would not suffer the least undue familiarity of the kind ?\" Miss Clanbrassey now exclaimed, turning sharply and fiercely round, and giving a flashing glance of scorn and hatred from her large, hawk-grey eyes, at the shabby figure on her heels. \"Well, no, Miss Featherstone. I meant no offence against your sister, the Countess, or any other foreigner of the sort. Only I could not but wonder you should be the means yersel', and seem to intend to make quite a gala of it, to bring any of the Clanbrassey people about your uncle again !\" \" Oh, the Countess will do no harm ; she was never a favourite with my uncle \u2014 never can be ! I am not afraid of her ! My ruin will not come from that direction !

I am growing weary of it all, as well as my uncle ! And what did you mean by"], [48, "40 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. writing that extraordinary letter of yours to me at the post-office in Liverpool ? Had I not ex pressly told you I would never receive any such from you ? and only gave you the reference there, in case there was any matter of private business you might wish to communicate with me upon ? Not such stuff as you dared to write to me !\" Miss Clanbrassey, it was evident to Bailiff Blackmore, was rather striving to pick an occa sion for quarrel, than avoiding one now ; and he was considerably taken aback with the con viction. He replied evidently with some dis order and surprise, but still with a degree of asperity, like a man who felt his rights assailed. \" Dared to write to you, Miss Featherstone ! Well ! I was not much afraid you would make known to people what I wrote to you \u2014 business or otherwise ! And had I not a right to wonder why you so suddenly changed the whole plan of operations, and refused to proceed to Scotland \u2014 to Scarboro', if you like to ca' it better, and think it necessary to keep up that fable between ourselves ! \u2014 where we could have been as easily married as look at one another, and no one ever"], [49, "41 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. have been a bit the wiser ! Don't be afraid, and glower round so ; nobody can possibly hear anything we say here !\" Miss Clanbrassey, nevertheless, looked around her on all sides with extreme anxiety and vex ation manifest in her whole appearance. But things really seemed safe enough. They had reached a winding in the ancient avenue to Featherstone Hall, which was on elevated ground, whence no kind of prying observation could be discerned. It is true that the way was shadowed almost to darkness, strong daylight as it still was overhead, by the lofty oaks and larch trees which skirted it, with a great deal of tangled brushwood on one side. On the other there was a deep precipitous hollow behind the irre gular mound which backed the Hall, filled at the bottom with a stagnant sort of a water, or bog, creamed over partially with weeds bristling with bulrushes, and bordered by a number of weeping willows, which gave a damp and wo begone aspect to the spot, and had obtained for it its name of the \" Willow Water.\" Probably it had been a great fish-pond in the palmy days of the Hall, before the entail began to"], [50, "42 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. run so nigh the present possessor's relinquish ment. Having satisfied herself by her own eagle survey, rather than the assurances of her com panion, that there was no reason to apprehend espionage, Miss Clanbrassey replied to the bailiff's extraordinary observation no less extra ordinarilv. \" I must have been mad when the bare idea entered my head, either of Scotland or Scarbo borough !

So it would seem ! as she uttered these words. Blackmore's dull eyes certainly retaliated with"], [51, "43 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. an unwonted lighting up of rage and malignancy as the denunciation reached his hearing. But he replied with the sang-froid he thought it necessary to preserve against her violence. \" A wonderful story, truly ! I am a wizard, I suppose, and deal in love-philtres ! Or am I to blame because you overstepped all reason and common sense, as you always do in every thing, in the use of a medication which I had found of the most singular advantage in my own complaint \u2014 this ugly asthma that has lurked in me ever since I took my part in the draining of the great bog of Kintore \u2014 and recommended it to you for the black vapours and megrims that were always hanging over you, and threatened in the end to develop the sources of madness in you, in their direst form \u2014 which, from all that I can gather of your family, seems to have been for generations roaring in fever, or stagnating into melancholy madness, in your ill-mixed Irish blood ?\" \" Well ! no doubt what you did was all done with the best intentions. Hell is paved with such, Mr. Blackmore. Let's say no more about that. But, remember, I only promised"], [52, "44 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. to take the miserable step I have disappointed you in not taking, which would degrade me at once to nigh the lowest level of society, and break utterly the heart of the kind and good man who has sheltered me and mine so [long with such ill results to himself \u2014 if a direful necessity should be found to exist. If I found I had no escape from one abyss of shame and misery but by plunging down the lowest of all \u2014 Yet in preference to that, without any figure of speech, I would have cast myself down this scaur into the pond below ! But I could not tell what discoveries might follow on the despe rate deed, even were I dead and suffocated in those foul waters there \u2014 unless they could cover me till doomsday. I was glad of it afterwards that I did not, when, as I tell you, I discovered there was no necessity for either fatal and irremediable act,\" Miss Clanbrassey now replied, staring with a species of fierce triumph in her gaze, at her stricken auditor, who seemed at once strangely perplexed and baffled, too, by what he heard. \" You have consulted physicians, then,\" he said ; and it is to be noted that, when he chose, he could drop the dialect of his remote province"], [53, "45 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. in everything but a peculiar see-saw accentua tion, \u2014 \" and they have told you, you were in a condition to defy and balk me thus ?\" \" They have told me that nothing ailed me but the indiscreet use of opium, and that I could be easily and certainly re-established in my health, if I could bring myself to renounce the pernicious habit of its secret consumption. I have resolved to renounce it, and for ever, and with it my detestable initiation into its horrible, reason-destroving delights.\" \" Indeed ! Varra fine, varra fine ! But the devil is blamed for all the blacks in the air. You consulted physicians, Miss Featherstone, \u2014 or Miss Clanbrassey, I believe I ought to say, \u2014 on your case, in Liverpool?\" Blackmore ob served, with a sardonic smile of incredulity. \" No ; I went on to Birmingham. I knew where to apply. Old Lizzie Beattie, who has been a hospital nurse there, you know \" \" No ; you have been on no recommendation of hers, Miss Clanbrassey, since you tell me where to aoply for information in your steps,\" Blackmore interrupted her, with a savage snarl of impatience and incredulity."], [54, "46 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. \" Be it as you choose, my good man. Pro fessional gentlemen are not in the habit of be traying their patients' secret to chance in quirers,\" replied Miss Clanbrassey, with disdain and defiance audible in all her tones, \" even when they happen to be aware of their names ; but I was a total stranger in Birmingham, and purpose so to remain.\" \" You refuse, then, to fulfil your contract, woman, and break your plighted word ?\" ex claimed Blackmore, with a ferocity and vehe mence of which his usual cringing demeanour gave little previous intimation of capability. \" I have spoken the word ! I came home determined on this explanation, and thought it best made at once and for ever,\" returned Miss Clanbrassey, seemingly unruffled on her part by the display. \" What would you have, man ? Save when under the intoxicating influence of your poison, I have always despised, detested, shunned you and your association in every re spect.

You have yourself let me know that your savings already, fully authorized by Mr. Featherstone, amount to five thousand pounds ! If I am allowed the management of the property in my own way, even if Mr. Featherstone should only live another five years, I'll engage to draw a thousand per annum, at the least, over all ex penditure from it more than it now produces ;"], [56, "48 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. especially if I am suffered to proceed in the draining of the Moss !

I am no beggar myself, for that matter ; I could, at all events, show half sovereigns for your whole ones any day. But I am not anxious any more than yourself to thrust the position of our affairs on your uncle's knowledge, if you only put my mind at rest by fulfilling your engage- ment to marry me ! The whole thing can re- main a secret for years \u2014 till your uncle dies, even \u2014 in such a quiet place as this, so unsuspi- ciously as we are situated towards each other ; and meanwhile, we may save enough out of the property to make us rich, and respected, and happy, all the rest of the days of our lives \u2014 and to account for our marrying one another when we do so openly at last.\""], [57, "49 FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. \" Do not annoy me any longer with this absurd talk, Blackmore !

Believe me now when I repeat it to you, and I will swear any oath to confirm you in the certainty of my resolution, you, or your master, the devil, can invent or impose !\" Rosanna returned with an energy that stamped every word as she spoke it, as if in brass. \" Varra guid, varra guid ! But there are two ay's go to one consent, ye're maybe's aware, Miss Clanbrassey ! And do you think I will allow you to cast me off in this fashion, like potato peelings into the swine's tub, now your kind fancy for me is over, or some new one per haps come up in the place ?\" Rosanna's sallow complexion fevered up scar let at this latter observation, not unmarked by her antagonist.

What imaginable proof have you ? I never wrote you a single word in a letter even of which you could make the smallest handle !\" \" It was your cunning, doubtless, then !

But she believed she had a spell to conjure down this unexpected resentment and revenge also. \"Mr. Blackmore,\" she said, after a pause, \"it is just possible that, as you say, if you be come entirely reckless of consequences to your self, personal and otherwise, you might do me the unimaginable dishonour of coupling my name in the disgraceful, cowardly, and libellous manner with your own, you seem to believe in your power.

Take the half of all I possess in the world, then, and leave me and Featherstone Hall in peace !\" Blackmore listened, but with an evident in crease rather of suspicion and anger, than any other emotion. Nor was Miss Clanbrassey at all prepared for the tone in which he took up his refusal. \" I am glad you have made me this offer,\" he said, in a bitterly sarcastic manner ; \" not that I am the least in the world inclined to accept it, but that it enables me to let you see it was not your money, Miss Featherstone, but your un engaging personal self, as you so modestly af fect to consider it, that has all along been the grand \u2014 the sole object of my hopes and pur poses !

Ugh, ugh, ugh !' 6 Whatever might otherwise have been the ef fect of so unexpected a burst of a genuine per sonal devotion, as it might have seemed in the Scotch bailiff, was quite destroyed by his un lucky asthmatic cough at the conclusion. \" It seems as if one might not have long to wait for that result, Blackmore! But beware, in your turn, how you drive me to despair. You have not been ill-informed that my family is capable of very extraordinary actions when its tempestuous blood is raised !\" Miss Clan brassey answered ; and, in truth, an indistinct but terrible thought went past her staring gaze almost visually, like a spectre of the slain, with its horrors wrapped from sight in the shroud. \" But surely,\" she continued, with a more pa thetic form of appeal, \" you have done me in-"], [63, "FEATHERSTONE HAUGH. 55 jury enough already \u2014 to my own heart and feelings, and sense of honour of every sort ! \u2014 But we will have time enough to consider the fairest and best terms for us to part on, and for you to weigh at leisure my proposition.

You might even avail yourself of the return-chaise that brought me here to get to the railway ; and, after a fortnight or three weeks, passed asunder, we may meet again to discuss matters more calmly.

Miss Clanbrassey, however, saw the danger she was running upon, and affecting at once to recall the circumstance to her mind, she replied, with lips that vibrated with a strange pang as well as with suppressed indignation as she spoke, \" Ah, truly, Mr. Pendragon ! Well, you might stay to see him on the subject you men tion, and then \u2014 \" But at this point of the dialogue both the parties were startled by the noise of approaching footsteps, and Miss Clanbrassey, hurriedly ex claiming, \"It is my uncle!\" went forward as if to meet him, while the bailiff slunk as hastily off in the opposite direction."], [65, "CHAPTER III.

Most contrary to what might have been ex pected also, he did not seem pleased or mollified by the approach of his favourite niece, after so unusual an absence. He even called her Miss Clanbrassey ! A name which hardly ever, as a rule, passed his lips. He sometimes playfully, indeed, addressed her as Miss Featherstone, which was almost in variably her designation in the house and among the tenantry. \" Back again at last, Miss Clanbrassey !

It is quite strange and presuming, I declare ! But 1 hope you do not blame me so completely for his doings, that you make me no kinder wel come home than to reproach me with them ?\" Rosanna said, and with an emotion which was thoroughly unfeigned. She looked at her uncle, indeed, with a yearning tenderness and indescrib able underglow of such mingled and most pathetic anguish of grief, remorse, and appeal, that his chivalrous man's nature was touched in all its chords. \" My dearest girl \u2014 my poor, kind, unhappy Rosanna ! \u2014 what makes you look so strangely at me ? Of course I make you welcome back to your home \u2014 it is yours as much as my own, and more so \u2014 a thousand times ! And no father's heart could receive you to it more lovingly and trustingly than your uncle's always has and shall !\" And he kissed her very kindly and fondly, and took her hand, and was so startled by the chill upon it in contrast to her burning face, that he set down his gun, and began to chafe it between his ; while his dogs, gathering"], [68, "60 UNCLE AND NIECE. round him to the number of quite a dozen, looked on askant, but seemed to think they had no part to take in the demonstration. Perhaps the sagacious brutes were aware that on more than one occasion Miss Clanbrassey had heard without dissent her bailiff's reasoning against the necessity of so many superfluous, eating creatures being kept about the place, now that the Squire so seldom called upon their services, as a sportsman ! \" You spoke rather crossly, uncle, as if you thought I was to blame in accepting Mrs. Marry nett's invitation to the christening. I am sure I have enjoyed myself at it as little as any person could possibly desire I should,\" replied Rosanna, resuming with an effort something of her usual tone, ascendancy, and sway with Mr. Featherstone. \" I did not believe you would much, with those vulgar, purse-proud people, dear ! No, I was not thinking at all of that. I should have been very glad if you had enjoyed yourself a little. I begin to be afraid that I have kept you a little too selfishly to myself about the old place here, especially now I am growing older,"], [69, "61 UNCLE AND NIECE. and not much company for you in out- door movements,\" Mr. Featherstone answered, with affection and regretful self-accusation in all his tones. But he went on, in a changed voice and with evident irritation, to observe : \" What annoys and vexes me, Rosanna, is that you should have set up that Scotchman in such a tyrannous sway and insolence that, I believe, he almost begins to fancy himself the Lord of the Manor ! I have been finding out all kinds of things in that way ever since you have been absent \u2014 my attention being first called to it by a rather singular circumstance. The very day you went off, I got so tired of sitting alone and yawning over the newspaper, with nobody to speak to, or exchange an idea with, tbat I thought I would take a walk to the Lodge, and inquire if anybody was looking properly after your guinea-fowls and my pheasants, and how poor Mopsy was getting on. But when I arrived there, I heard such a noise of women crying and sobbing in the place, I was quite amazed, and walked in without letting the people know who was there. And there I found Mrs. Ulla thorn and her pretty young daughter (the girl's"], [70, "62 UNCLE AND NIECE. like a fresh-blown, living young damask rose, and quite embellishes the old tumble-down place with her presence, since she came to live at the Lodge from her grandmother's, who is dead, I believe, quite lately) weeping and. wailing fit to break their hearts, and the hearts of all who heard them. And what do you think about ? Because this wonderful bailiff of yours had taken a fancy to have the whole farmhouse to himself, without any reason that I can possibly imagine, for I don't hear he is going to make any woman miserable as a wife. And so he had ordered the under-bailiff and his family to pack up that very night, and take up their abode in the ruinous old gamekeeper's hut at the other side of the park, you know ! I was so amazed at the daring insolence of the thing, without con- sulting me or anybody \u2014 even you, Rosanna, so far as I can learn \u2014 that I should have spoken my mind pretty freely to him at the time, had he been in the way. But to crown the affair, he had gone off to market with a fellow drivino- Mopsy, without leave or licence, and had been gone so long that it was useless to send after him. But that introduced the subject, and"], [71, "63 UNCLE AND NIECE. finding she was to be protected, Mrs. Ullathorn set to work and told me such a number of stories about the man's hard-hearted, tyrannous doings on the estate, that I determined to make inquiries on a more general scale, and ascertain the truth for myself. And so I did \u2014 and I never heard such accounts as I have since, on all sides, about your grand vizier. Why, Anna ! he is improving the estate into a complete desert ! Half my tenantry have vanished, or have received notices to quit \u2014 those, you know, that had not leases on my life ! And as fast as the farms fall in upon these extraordinary evic tions, I find Blackmore takes the land into his own hands, and it seems likely to end with his being the only name on our rent-roll ! Upon my honour, Rosanna, I don't think it either proper or safe to place us in such a position, I may almost say of dependency, on a greedy stranger fellow like that. And I always thought you had too much of the spirit of a Queen Eliza beth in you to allow your authority and power \u2014 deputed into your hands, to be sure \u2014 to be engrossed and taken up in such a manner to himself by a menial prime minister of the sort !"], [72, "64 UNCLE AND NIECE. I tell you candidly, if I had not apprehended you would be seriously annoyed by the loss of your favourite's services, I would have given him half a year's wages and the sack that very first night of your departure.\" \" It would not have annoyed me, uncle ! \u2014 Not much !\" replied Miss Clanbrassey, troubled with what she felt was the look of scrutiny and inquiry fixed upon her by her uncle. \" But it would have thrown everything on the estate into confusion \u2014 and, besides, Blackmore has secured several parcels of land to his own use, under grants you could not quite withdraw all at once. I am glad you did not proceed to any sudden thing of that sort \u2014 by which he might fairly have thought himself aggrieved. What was done about the Ullathorns ? Now I re- member, the puritanical good man would have it, the girl was too pretty to remain among all those men-servants and people of the farm, and said she would be better at a distance from them. He means well, but he has his Scotch notions on everything in very disagreeable strength and quality.\" \" I don't know that. I have always heard"], [73, "UNCLE AND NIECE. 65 the Scotch were a sturdy, independent set of fellows, in a general way. But this man carneys and fawns about one, till one is ready to knock him down, that he may lick the dust before one the easier ! And what does he mean by bother ing me about his family and his good original descent, but for the extravagance of some great great grandfather reducing them all to want? When he came here first, he seemed rather proud to have only the poorest people for his progenitors \u2014 and I rather respected him for it ! And now, forsooth, the Blackmores belong to some great clan in the north of Scotland, every red-shank of whom have been gentlemen- born since Adam or Fingal, whichever of .hem was before the other ! What can the idiot mean ?\" Rosanna, trembling in secret with indignant consciousness, was yet fain to declare she could not tell. And the hesitation of her manner probably vaguely increased Mr. Featherstone's irritation. \" On my own part, Rosanna,\" he continued, clearing his voice, and resuming his gun, having certainly warmed his niece's hands by chafing VOL. III. 5"], [74, "66 UNCLE AND NIECE. them, while her face had grown proportionately pale, \" I own I have often wondered of late to see you going about so much with a common servant-fellow like that, who was not even em ployed to carry your pattens for you. You go wherever he pleases to summon you; see with his eyes, hear with his ears, only ! That will never do, my girl ! If you do manage the estate, still I think you ought not to forget the lady in the agriculturist, and go tramping about in the miry fields, listening to the oracles of a conceited Triptolemus like Blackmore. You have no business with the working part of the affair ; results alone concern us ; we hire these people to save us trouble that way.\" \" And yet but this moment, uncle, you found fault with me for trusting too completely and implicitly to the man ! And you forget, also, that the whole bent and object of the education you have bestowed on me \u2014 by your own account \u2014 has been to make me forget that I was a woman even ! Let alone a lady !\" Rosanna spoke with a bitterness she could not repress, and which her uncle very clearly discerned. But he seemed rather saddened"], [75, "67 UNCLE AND NIECE. than vexed by the blame that his niece thus threw on his conduct towards herself. \" I do begin to think I have taken upon me more than I ought, in the way of attempting to train you out of what Nature must always have intended a woman to be !\" he said, moodily. \" But consider, Anna dear ! what women have been to me ! how they have treated me after all my kindness to them ! I don't allude to your poor mother now ; you need not look so startled, girl ! It was folly with her \u2014 sheer folly ; her mind was a very weak one. But look at Char lotte and Philippina ; how they behaved to me ! They had not your powerful intellect and com prehension of what they were about, Rosanna, it is true. But they had average sense, and therefore their misbehaviour towards me wants the excuse of ignorance, and was cruel and un principled in the extreme. Supposing even that Charlotte had a right to please herself, a girl without fortune marrying a rich parvenu ; see how Philippina disgraced herself and the whole family by rushing into an alliance with an in famous adventurer and impostor, merely because he pretended to be a Count ! It is true, the 5\u20142"], [76, "68 UNCLE AND NIECE. stupid woman might fancy she was marrying a person of birth and connexions, and that is some apology with me. But I could never forgive a woman for wilfully, and with her eyes open, descending in the scale of society ! It is an infamy that I could never pardon !\" Mr. Featherstone spoke with a tremble of passion mingled with apprehension in his tones, which could scarcely have escaped Rosanna's observation, though he drew her hand, as he spoke, into his arm, kindly enough, and at the conclusion whistled, with an affectation of cheeriness, to his dogs to rise and accompany them on their return to the house. There was evidently an emphatic pause ; but Miss Clanbrassey answered as if unconscious of the meaning of the last observation, though she was quite well aware in her own mind, now, that the clamour against the bailiff had not been confined, during her absence, altogether to his arbitrary proceedings in the management of the estate ! \" Nor ought you, sir !\" she replied to her uncle's last observation, in tones even startlingly acquiescent, but eluding the point of the remark"], [77, "69 UNCLE AND NIECE. with great dexterity. \" You have suffered too much already in that way, however advantageous in money respects the Marrynett connexion has proved. Indeed, the Marrynetts seem now to have abandoned all hope of ever being reconciled to you. But my sister Philippina either pre tends, or feels, so much gratitude to you for your sustained kindness towards her, that she would not hear of leaving this part of the country without making you a visit of thanks. Of course, uncle, I could not be off saying you would be glad to see her.\" \" You said anything but the truth, then ! I wish you would send her word, Rosanna, that I consider her love and duty sufficiently proved by all the important acts of her life, and tbat she need not come to give me any additional assurance, as I won't cut her off her allowance until she sends me word herself that her brother's liberality enables her to dispense with it alto gether. Her brother ! I wonder what sort of stuff brothers are made of nowadays !

You have been everything to me \u2014 father, mother, sisters, brothers \u2014 everything !\" said Rosanna, with a degree of fervid passion in her utterance that attested how thoroughly in earnest she was in the expression. \" Still,\" she continued, in a lower, and, as it were, withdrawn tone, \" I do not suppose we should have been the worse \u2014 as you say, uncle \u2014 for a little more communion with the world. And, besides, my sister is not likely to make a long visit, unless you are most particularly pressing. To be sure, there is another person she had so bespoken into her train, that I could not well avoid asking him, too. But this is an addition to the pleasure of Madame de la Mazurka's company which I think will really prove one to you.

And as he seemed to acquiesce, after a brief interval of thoughtfulness, in the arrangement, it was so concluded ; and Rosanna changed the subject of conversation, with a visible effort, to her recent adventures and experiences, gay and the reverse, in Liverpool."], [87, "CHAPTER IV. A LIMED SOUL, STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. Mr. Featherstone listened to all Rosanna's Liverpool stories with the interest persons of secluded habits oftener take in the bustling movements of the world, than those who share in them. The story of the returned convict, which had already become the subject of news paper reports, quite delighted him. \" I am sorry for the poor old fellow,\" he said, \" but to think that the Marrynetts should have overreached themselves at last to the tune of fifty thousand pounds is very satisfactory !\" Rosanna spared him as much as she could of the magnificence of the christening ; of the love affairs of the younger girls she herself knew next to nothing, not being esteemed a suitable con-"], [88, "80 A LIMED SOUL, fidante. She could, therefore, tell little, and she told nothing. But she remarked, with growing satisfaction on her own account, that the more she harped on the string, the more her uncle was pleased when she mentioned Mr. Pendragon in terms of eulogium, or dwelt on his great and noble qualities, personal and mental. Not tnat she herself was at all convinced that her hopes with regard to this accomplished and highborn gentleman were assured of any realiz- ation. That ecstatic vision had melted away in the darkened daylight of Featherstone Haugh, or, at best, had left only scattered flecks of purple brightness over the moody sky. But it comforted her own heart to find herself still capable of an exalted and unselfish tenderness, and she saw that it contributed more than any- thing else she could have said or done to dissi pate her uncle's unhappy, though certainly limited suspicions, of the nature of her relations with the detestable bailiff. On one point Miss Clanbrassey was resolved. She would break off her ill-advised connexion with that person, and deplorable subjection to his designing purposes. The problem only was"], [89, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 81 how to do it without compromising her own reputation, or ruining herself in the good opinion of her uncle. Difficulties encountered her at the first step. In spite of all the bustle and movement of pre paration for the distinguished visitors that pre vailed, almost immediately, at the Hall and its approaches, Blackmore did not make his appear ance among the impressed farm-servants and villagers. Consequently, Rosanna found no opportunity to deliver Mr. Featherstone's per mission to that worthy to absent himself on his visit to his relations ; which she intended to soften and disguise as well as she could, but so as to secure an immediate acquiescence in the plan. And when towards evening, noticing this circumstance, she made inquiries for \" Mr. Black more,\" she learned, with a secret consciousness of a harmful meaning in the pretext, that the bailiff had complained on a sudden of being very ill with his asthma, and had betaken himself to his bed at the Lodge. Both Rosanna and her uncle felt foiled by this man\u0153uvre, for both suspected and believed it to be one, though Mr. Featherstone only gave VOL. III. 6"], [90, "82 A LIMED SOUL, vent to his opinion. \" Hang the fellow ! It is a dodge, I suppose, though how he can have found out our intentions puzzles me !\" Rosanna stood the bailiff's friend, however, in this instance, and remarked that he was rather subject to attacks of the kind, and had of late been always prowling about in the damp \" Moss,\" studying his plans of drainage of that extensive tract. But it was a complete countermove. Miss Clanbrassey, of course, could not visit a man servant in his bedroom ; and Mr. Featherstone absolutely refused to show the slightest mark of attention and respect of the kind to Abednego Blackmore. \" It will put him on fancying I think something of him and his Gaelic genealogy, after all, and don't mean to turn him off \u2014 on which I am as fixed as Lancaster Castle ! If you only ask a scheming rascal like that what o'clock it is, he takes his advantages !\" Mr. Featherstone said ; and Rosanna dared not press the matter. She hit upon a middle way, however, and sent old Dobson, the major-domo at the Hall, to the bailiff in his retreat : with Miss Clan brassey's compliments, and she was very sorry"], [91, "83 STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. to hear that he was taken so unwell ; but hoped that a visit to his native air would do him good, which Mr. Featherstone particularly desired he would take ; and at that comparatively idle season of the year, before harvest-work came on, she (Miss Clanbrassey) felt she could quite com fortably relieve him for a few weeks from the trouble and responsibilities of his office as general superintendent of the estate. Dobson, who loved the bailiff as little as any one \u2014 or less, perhaps, than others, annoyed at his favour with his young lady \u2014 gladly undertook this task, and, encouraged by Miss Clanbrassey's evident earnestness to obtain the result, brought back a faithful \u2014 a too faithful \u2014 account of its failure. He said, he never saw anybody looking so \" unsightsome\" and queer as Mr. Blackmore, into whose apartment he could hardly get ad mittance, as he was wonderfully locked and bolted in. But when he did so, he found him hard at work, packing up a lot of papers and some bundles of clothes and bedding in a large box, covered with dust and sweat, and munching, as he thought, some black stuff like tobacco. 6\u20142"], [92, "84 A LIMED SOUL, Otherwise he showed no symptoms of being ill. But when the message was delivered to him, he had replied, with his duty to \" Miss Feather stone,\" that he felt too seriously unwell to avail himself of her and the Squire's great kindness at that moment : and was, besides, most anxious to get the drainage works at the Moss in pro gress before his departure. At the same time, not being very comfortable at the Lodge, after recent events, and to show that he meant no harm to the Ullathorns by having suggested their removal to the deserted gamekeeper's cottage, called \" the Hut,\" which was close on the morass, he meant to take himself off there, and look after things as usual till he felt better able to undertake a long journey. \" But, in point of fact, Miss,\" continued Dob son, with an indignantly serious mien, \" Muster Blackmore as good as told me that he had \u2022almost as much interest as the Squire's hainsel' in the lands about the Ha' here, and that he should never think of leaving his propriety to the management of womenfolk that knew so little about the matter, at this most particular time for the crops, that are a'most yellow for the"], [93, "85 STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. reaping-hook, or will be if the fair weather holds on for another three weeks or a month !\" \" He is going to the Hut \u2014 and complaining of asthma !\" exclaimed Rosanna, much startled indeed, but not by the concern for the bailiff that her words indicated. \" What an ill-omened place, too ! Was it not deserted, Dobson, be cause the last man that had the care of it hanged himself in a fit of the glooms, at the loneliness and melancholy of all around ? Let him go there, by all means, then !\" she concluded, bit terly, but feeling that it would be dangerous to cross Blackmore in his strange determination. \" And it is true he has the park-grazing and some of the outlying cold lands on the Moss, on a short lease, to reclaim, as he says, Dobson ! Uncle will hardly know whether he is there or in Scotland, if only he removes out of his sight from the Lodge; and the Ullathorns cannot possibly be expected to get on comfortably with a man who tried to turn them out of their snuggery into such a wild, unwholesome banish ment.\" Miss Clanbrassey endeavoured to give the singular affair this turn to Dobson and his a"], [94, "86 A LIMED SOUL, fellow-servants, who were bound to take her elucidation for the gospel of the matter. But her task was more difficult with Mr. Featherstone. However, she explained to him that she had in reality assigned a sort of part- nership interest in the reclaiming of the bog, and divers surrounding oases of grass and meadow land, to the grasping steward, which he had authorized by his signature. Consequently they could not proceed to any summary action in the affair. At all events, they had better not attempt any until the visit from Liverpool was over, as summary action would probably lead to disagreeable and, it might be, noisy dis- cussions \u2014 but let the bailiff have his own way in what he proposed, which would remove his unwelcome presence out of sight, at all events. In other respects, his control over the property could be easily diminished, or even cast off al- together, by the owner's personal interference. And he would possibly get tired of forcing his unwished association on proprietors who so evidently repudiated his plans and theories of management, and withdraw, of his own accord, from further trouble and interference."], [95, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 87 Mr. Featherstone was at first highly indig nant at such a sustained opposition to his de termination.

He made some passionate reflections, however, to Miss Clanbrassey on the folly and undue confidence she had exhibited towards this stranger by binding him down to such engagements, almost unknown to himself; and she perceived, with increasing secret anxiety, that her uncle's former deeper uneasiness and vague, mistrust returned. She only, indeed, succeeded in a slight degree in removing this impression, and bringing a smile to his irritated countenance, by saying that Blackmore might perhaps take his pre decessor's example, and so rid them of all further trouble on that score ! And that, but"], [96, "88 A LIMED SOUL, for the scandal of the repeated case, she heartily hoped he would. \" And, in reality,\" she added, with a singu larly moody and self-involved air of thought, \" Blackmore is a very gloomy fellow, and I have heard him talk of suicide, as if he rather relished the idea.

And he will soon find out that the fogs and mists of the Moss do not compose the kind of atmosphere fittest for an asthmatic to inhale.\" \" Upon my honour, Rosanna, this Scotch gentleman, of the most ancient breechless de scent, is a remarkably various person in his tastes and humours !\" Mr. Featherstone re plied, with much asperity. \" Do you know what, some time ago, he had the hardihood to suggest to me, and which surprised me very"], [97, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 89 greatly at the time, though I never mentioned it before? He complained to me of the cold and farmyard exhalations about the lodge, and threw out a pretty plain innuendo that as there were so many apartments vacant at the Hall, which were unused all the year round, mightn't he as well take up his abode with us here ? He would even be content, he condescendingly observed, with an upper chamber in the old tower \u2014 among the family muniments and pa pers, I suppose ! I thought it was only his Scotch notions of saving fire and candle-light at our expense in the hall-kitchen at the time ; but still it annoyed me. And I told him pretty sharply \u2014 at all events, in a way he un derstood \u2014 that I should as soon think of lodging my cows and bullocks under the same roof with myself, as the people whose business it was to look after them. And now it seems ' Hang-dog Hut,' as the people call it, is good enough for him ! You know Bill Brackenbury hung his dog with himself; and that appears to have struck the public attention more than what one would consider the main fact, in the stupid creature's manner of earthing himself up in a"], [98, "90 A LIMED SOUL, hole of his own for ever. But he did not do it in a fit of the dismals, as you seem to suppose the landscape may influence others to go and do likewise ! Brackenbury did it all for love ; on account of that very pretty young girl at the lodge, who was almost a child then, and would have nothing whatever to say to him. And indeed, I must say, she looks far above the wooing; of a roug;h fellow like that.\" Rosanna had never before heard of this signal act of imprudence and audacity committed by the bailiff in trying to instal himself under her uncle's roof \u2014 probably in consequence of its ignominious repulse. The hectic fire glowed out on her cheek bones as she heard the full account, and then the recollection dived down to join the ever accumulating sense of exasperation and des perate resolve to be freed, in some manner or other, from the nightmare oppression that weighed upon all the energies and hopes of her existence, and bound her up as if in the icy spell of a living and conscious death. No obstacle or counter invitation \u2014 as it is almost possible the bailiff hoped or anticipated"], [99, "91 STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. from tbe menacing character he threw upon his movements and previous intimations \u2014 arising, Blackmore was finally compelled to carry out the plan he had announced. He withdrew to \" Hang-Dog Hut\" in a single cart, with his lug gage and a few articles of furniture belonging to himself, declining any other assistance ; though his subaltern, willing enough to facilitate the departure, or in ironical triumph, volunteered every assistance in his power. But those who marked his departure, taking the dark and sandy road which led by steep declivities to the Moss, declared they had never seen mortal man look so gloomy and discom fited before, and blessed themselves that they were not likely to be the subject of the scowling meditation in which he continued plunged while eng;ag;ed in the removal. And his disgrace at DO O the Hall being rendered palpable and clear by the operation, conjoined with his own unpopu larity, rendered it unlikely that this exile to the marshy Siberia of Featherstone Haugh would find many sources of consolation and society either in the new resting-place, or in the con tinued exercise of an authority which it speedily"], [100, "92 A LIMED SOUL, became known Blackmore retained in a manner against the wishes of the proper and beloved proprietor \u2014 Squire of that ilk. However, one great object seemed secured to Miss Clanbrassey by the exodus. The Moss and its overlooking cot were separated from the Hall by more than two good miles over the Park and a scattered and broken tract of country that lay beyond it. Consequently the bailiff's jealous surveillance was effectually removed from her doings there, and, at all events, could in turn be observed and guarded against. Her uncle was partly satisfied again by the plain cer tainty that she entered heartily, and without underhand contravention, into his designs of getting rid of his domineering bailiff, whose familiar companionship with her, had been hinted to him in a style which he now con sidered to be the exaggeration of a justifiable dislike and resentment of the ill-usage projected by the suspect, or put into active operation long before. \" The poor fellows, but especially the woman \u2014 pretty May's mother \u2014 knew that nothing could set me so against their tyrant as tbe bare bus-"], [101, "93 STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. picion \u2014 ! Bah ! it is utter nonsense, or all my teachings and education ought to be considered the theories and contrivances of a lunatic, en tirely ignorant of a watchmaker's trade, under taking to convert a shaving-box into a first-rate repeater !\" Mr. Featherstone soliloquised on more than one occasion, after he had clearly ascertained at the Lodge that the bailiff was gone thence with every scrap and vestige of his ownership he could collect, to his distant banish ment, without a single word of remonstrance or deprecation having been addressed to him by his niece. And also, as he clearly got to un derstand, without her exchanging a single pri vate word with him by speech, message, or writing, excepting to send Dobson to say that if there was anything in the stores at the Hall that could be useful to Mr. Blackmore in taking up his abode so far from his usual sources of supply, he had only to send the housekeeper word. The bailiff replied with many humble thanks that he was a man of few wants, and had these all amply provided for ; or, if he required any thing else, Neil, the carrier, would kindly take"], [102, "94 A LIMED SOUL, the trouble to execute any little commission he might find requisite to have executed. \" Does he think to break my heart by s\u00b0 much extra desolation and denial of all creature comforts to himself?\" Miss Clanbrassey mur mured scornfully to herself, when she received the reply. \" Wicked idiot ! to fancy so ! Let him double his doses of opium, then ! He has often told me that they open the gates of para dise for him, and that he has nothing more to desire on earth when he is in one of his complete states of bang !\" Nevertheless, Mr. Blackmore took occasion to fancy he had forgotten some trifles in his late apartments, on the day, and about the hour, when he had learned that the visitors from Liverpool were expected. And he was glaring down halfway out of one of the low windows, when Madame the Countess de la Mazurka, attended by Mr. Pendragon, as her cavalier for the nonce, rolled in at the avenue gate, in the full dash and splendour of the showy Marrynett equipage, with its handsome liveries, and high stepping, snow-white, two pairs of horses, glit tering in silver harness, and decorated with"], [103, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 95 bunches of flowers in their ears, and coachman and postilion to match. Mrs. Marrynett had insisted that her sister should return to the Hall of her ancestors in the full glory of this display of her riches, as the most emphatic expression of continued defiance and challenge to her un forgiving relative. And the Countess's vanity, and the lack of needful time to make any alter ations in the arrangement, induced her \u2014 though with some misgivings, certainly, as to the effect likely to be produced \u2014 to adopt the wealthy means of transit thus forced on her disposal ! The visitors arrived pretty closely at the hour assigned in the programme, and experienced a very cordial reception. They were both in good spirits, and well-disposed to be pleased with what they were to find. Mr. Pendragon, it is true, had some trifling drawbacks ; but they were of a kind that disposed him to regard with an increase of interest the possible results of his visit. It had struck him that Mr. Marrynett was superfluously liberal in forcing money upon him, on the security of his land, and urging him to embark it all, without delay, in the rising mining speculations they had taken in hand"], [104, "96 A LIM&D SOUL, together. He felt uneasy on this account, and desirous to be reassured by the Marrynett con- nexions with one of the most esteemed and honourable landowners in the county of the trustworthiness and good intentions of the com- mercial head of the race. Moreover, he had that very morning received a letter from the young governess of his still younger daughters, at Pendragon Castle, describing their headstrong and reckless defiance of her authority and re- straints, and tendering her resignation ; which had urged upon him a consideration that the likeliest way to bring these ungovernable girls to their senses would be to give them a step- mother, of mature age, high intellectual attain- ments, gravity and dignity of manner, good family and position, and whose personal appear- ance would support the notion that his heart still clung with unaltered fidelity to the love of his youth, however necessary he had found it to place another lady at the head of his family. The truth is, the Miss Pendragons had been completely spoilt in their childhood by the in dulgence of a foolish grandmother, to whose care their father had resigned them, while he"], [105, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 97 gave himself up to the luxuries of grief in soli tude during a long course of foreign travel. Madame the Countess laid herself out to be very agreeable on the way to Featherstone, for she could not yet disabuse herself of the notion of the irresistible attractions of her coquetry on any individual of the opposite sex, even of so cold and pre-engaged a character. It is very possible even \u2014 so heartless is the nature of coquettes \u2014 that Madame applied herself with the more earnestness to procure this gratifica tion of her vanity, with a view to the annoyance and hindrance of her sister, Rosanna, in her in explicable success ! And she was only the more piqued to the effort by Mr. Pendragon's sus tained withdrawal, or passive endurance of her flighty style of overture and \" attrait.\" But still he was rather amused by the restless volatility and sharpness of her remarks, and the reckless candour, if it might be called so, of her com mentaries on persons and things. Madame the Countess allowed no pause, how ever, for much reflection on anything she said, while sparing nothing and nobody in the stream of her clack. She described her uncle to Mr. 7 VOL. III."], [106, "98 A LIMED SOUL, Pendragon, for example, as a modern Timon, in the way of misanthropy, without the claims of the great despiser of his kind, of antiquity, to consider himself ill-used by the ingratitude of those whom he had served. On the contrary, she drew a picture, not alto gether destitute of resemblance, of egotism and selfishness on the part of the alleged generous guardian of the Clanbrasseys, which produced some effects that she did not anticipate. Mr. Pendragon was naturally led to consider that the extraordinary efforts made in the way of pre serving to himself the society of his youngest niece, by Mr. Featherstone, argued strongly for her merits. And the unsparingly satirical account Madame de la Mazurka gave of her uncle's system of education, so completely carried out in the case of his favourite kinswoman, more than ever satisfied Mr. Pendragon that he had lighted on the exact sort of woman most quali fied for the kind of partner and companion he desired henceforth in life. It was no drawback to a man who contemplated years of retirement, and of quiet retrieval of his affairs, to learn that Rosanna Clanbrassey had been brought up in a"], [107, "99 STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. seclusion which perfectly disqualified her for society. The sedate and learned hermitess, ac customed to submit her will to the will of others, answered to one of his own ideals of female ex cellence. And the tale accounted for a good deal of strange moodiness and brusquerie he had himself remarked in her. Going on in this way, the Countess and Mr. Pendragon arrived at Featherstone Haugh \u2014 a portion of the world which the lady had previously described, in her Frenchified style, as a country wild and waste as the plains of the \" dreary Cocytus,\" under the eternal sunless glimmer of a hopeless sky of fogs and gloom ! The Manor-house came in for its share of abusive description ; but, as it happened that tHere was a deep blue heaven overhanging the whole scene, and a plentiful allowance of sun shine thence diffused below, Mr. Pendragon was agreeably disappointed on his arrival. And with his recollections of his own dreary old castle, on the top of a bleak hill, crumbling rapidly in all directions to ruin, Featherstone Hall did not seem so benighted a spot. 7\u20142"], [108, "100 A LIMED SOUL, The sea shining in the distance, like a broad sash of purple brightness, further redeemed the dark and unattractive landscape that led to it. But he could not help agreeing with the Countess when, on the gates of the avenue being opened to their equipage by a blushing young girl from the Lodge, she exclaimed, \" Mon Dieu ! my sister must be crazy to leave such an extremely lovely young Hebe in full sight of a hearty old bachelor like my uncle ! Did you ever see a more blooming complexion than that girl's ? What can Rosanna mean by it ? I must put her on her guard ! And who is that dismal old fellow staring out of the window above at us ? Surely that can't be this famous bailiff who My sister and uncle have a Scotchman they trust everything to ! And most likely this is he, for she said he lived over the gateway farm house !\" \" A very disagreeable looking person cer tainly !\" said Mr. Pendragon, giving no further thought to the subject ; but most unfavourably impressed by the scowling earnestness of the scrutiny he saw fixed on himself from the gable window above. Yet, even the Countess was"], [109, "STRUGGLING TO BE FREE. 101 compelled to admit, in her own mind, that there was no mischief to be made out of so unpromis ing a looking shepherd for a \" bucolic intrigue\" as this !"], [110, "CHAPTER V. HANG-DOG HUT. The avenue had been cleared and prepared for a visitation by Miss Clanbrassey 's vigorously decisive arrangements, in spite of the secession of her usual principal minister, and the uncle and niece were both in readiness to receive their company, in the large, but not a little gloomy and sinister-looking \" cedar parlour \" of the ancient mansion, where visitors were usually welcomed \u2014 Mr. Featherstone restored, for once in a way, to a proper full suit of gentlemanly black ; Miss Clanbrassey in a robe that became her very well \u2014 white cashmere, trimmed with bugles, black velvet, and lace.

Certainly, in all her life she had never dressed herself with so much care and success. And \u2014 oh, magic of dress ! \u2014 instead of the wonted awkward giantess, she appeared as a stately priestess of Diana \u2014 of the Taiiric Diana it may be, a goddess to whom human sacrifices were acceptable ! And welcome was as plainly dis played as in the lamps of an illumination in all the brightness that gleamed on those large ex. pressive features, when Mr. Pendragon and his chattering companion made their expected ap pearance. It was impossible for the least vain of man kind, indeed, to doubt the nature of the emotion which shone up thus on Miss Clanbrassey's features; and Mr. Pendragon was by no means destitute of a manly proportion of vanity. He could perceive very plainly how anxiously he was"], [112, "104 HANG-DOG HUT. expected, and what pleasure his arrival gave ; though, perhaps, he smiled none the less to ob serve what trouble the Lady of Featherstone Haugh had given herself to assume an air of feminine tastes and occupation. For the first time, very likely, for years, Rosanna seemed to be engaged in knitting an antimacassar \u2014 un touched, I firmly believe, from the yellow hues of the texture and cotton, since Mrs. Primmer was abruptly ousted from the Hall. The poor woman certainly dropped three loops for every one she secured to the increment of the pattern, and started and trembled at every sound that n the least degree resembled the distant rolling of wheels. Her uncle, on his part, though he pretended to be very much absorbed in the political article in \" Blackwood,\" choice and pithy extracts from which he fancied himself to be reading aloud, with every appearance of under standing and relish, was perhaps little less absent of mind in realitv, and anxious for the coming: event. Nor did he even attempt to ascribe it to the prospect of an estranged niece's return. \" I don't care a jot about Philippina, whether she comes, or whether she stays away. But,"], [113, "105 HANG-DOG HUT. hang it, Rosanna,\" he exclaimed, \" I feel as nervous and uncomfortable as if something quite terrible was going to happen, instead of a commonplace visit from two persons, one a stranger to me \u2014 the other, I wish she was \u2022 Our solitary way of life makes both of us as shy as bats. How Liverpool must have annoyed you ! We must go out more into society, I think, if it is not too late ; perhaps, take an excursion to London, or Paris, as soon as we are well rid of your Scot. I almost do wish now you were married somewhere, my dear girl, that I might have a pretext and business to leave home, and inflict a long visit on you, and recover my acquaintance with the world while you were acquiring it.\" Rosanna had no time to be surprised at her uncle's remark, of a kind so unusual with him. The door opened ; and ushered in by the venerable male domestic of the establishment \u2014 who bad no occasion whatever to powder his hair, but did so to do honour to such a gala day \u2014 the Countess de la Mazurka rushed in, in an overpowering flurry of emotion. And before her uncle could be at all aware of her"], [114, "106 HANG-DOG HUT. purpose, she had thrown herself, with out stretched arms, and a proper proportion of shrieking continental ecstacy, on his neck, ex claiming, ' ' O mon oncle ! mon tres cher oncle !

And you do not allow me to thank Mr. Pendragon for the obliging trouble he has taken to be your escort, and to favour such hermits as we are at Featherstone with so distinguished a visit,\" said Mr. Featherstone, freeing himself really with some roughness from the Countess's ex cessive demonstrations. But he had missed what he wished to see \u2014 the meeting between his younger niece and the Welsh gentleman, which had taken place in perfect silence on both sides. But Mr. Pendragon held the hand he received an expressive moment beyond what was at all requisite in the way of polite greeting ; and eyeing the rapid changes in the lady's countenance, felt forced to say in his heart, \" She loves me !\" And this went much in the way of provoking a reciprocity of feeling"], [115, "107 HANG-DOG HUT. in the chivalrous nature of the descendant of the princes and chiefs of Pendragon Mohr. Madame de la Mazurka was very deeply but silently exasperated at the coldness of her uncle's greeting. \" It was the reception of a were-wolf!\" she said afterwards, writing to a particular friend in Paris, who was not a female one, but who liked gossiping. \" And I will never forgive it to my uncle ; and to my sister, who is doubtless the original provocation of it ! There are some men, it is truly remarked, whose benefits produce all the effects of in juries, from their detestable manner of con ferring them. My uncle is one of those men. But I was only the more determined, on that account, to open his eyes to my sister's de ception and ridiculous attempts at captivation of the stiff-necked widower, who had shown him self, on his part, a perfect misogynist, and in capable of appreciating the pleasures of cultivated female society.\" However, the Countess was destined to per ceive that her slighting cavalier and repelling uncle got on amazingly well together from the very first, speedily discerning in one another the"], [116, "108 HANG-DOG HUT. characteristics of the high-bred and intellectual gentlemen they both were in a most eminent degree. Mr. Featherstone, indeed, seemed in the greatest measure satisfied with all he ob served about his guest, and the awkwardness of a first meeting; was g;ot over between them so fast, that in a few minutes they seemed as if they had known each other all their lives, and were talking of men, and books, and politics, and agriculture, and field-sports, as pleasantly and sociably -as if they had sat for years at the same quarter-sessions. And in all this Miss Clanbrassey was nearly as well qualified as either gentleman to shine, and took a part in the conversation which produced, in still more striking points of view, the really extensive and powerful range of her acquirements. The poor flippancies of the Countess showed to miserable disadvantage in a company composed of persons of so much higher range of intellect, and she speedily found herself condemned to total si lence, or to impertinent interruptions, which were received with so little favour that she her self grew after awhile disinclined to make"], [117, "HANG-DOG HUT. 109 them, and sank into a peevish and disconcerted quietude. Even the somewhat frugal and unimposing style of housekeeping observed at Featherstone Hall was in accordance with the tastes of Mr. Pendragon, and tallied well with his plans of retrenchment and economy, until returning opulence should allow him to restore Pendragon Castle to its ancient splendours of hospitality and free-living at the domestic board. Every thing that was placed before him was, however, excellent of its kind, and attested the vigilant superintendence of the mistress of the establish ment, and the gentlemanly tastes and habits of the master. In short, there might have been some truth in the Countess's malignant ob servations at a subsequent period, that Mr. Pendragon was in search of a housekeeper, governess, duenna, and Blue Book epitome, when he proposed to her sister Rosanna ! But whatever might have been the dominant im pulses with the suitor himself, the wild and stormy romance of the feelings he aroused remained unaltered in that strangely-passioned"], [118, "110 HANG-DOG HUT. woman's heart, and produced the most startling results. It was a pleasant day for the congenial part of the company, Mr. Pendragon being further well- pleased to discern that although his at tentions to Mr. Featherstone's niece were marked, and much beyond what were her sim ple dues as hostess, the Squire himself in nowise answered the description he had received of his aversion to all views of matrimony on her ac count. On the contrary, a man\u0153uvring mother could scarcely have gone beyond this good uncle in his exertions to forward anything of the kind that might be in embryo. He was lavish in his praise of his niece in all her range of capaci ties, and took pains in drawing her out on the subjects he knew she was likely most to shine in. The truth is, the worthy Squire was much taken with Mr. Pendragon's manners and con versation, and relieved of more disquieting ap prehensions that any possible equal suitorage of the kind could have awakened in his breast, at any time. He was also surprised at Rosanna's success in engaging the affections and interest of so distinguished a person, and almost took a"], [119, "HANG DOG HUT. 111 kind of pride to himself on the subject, as if it was a triumph of his own original plans for her happy settlement in life. Under these circumstances the Squire even condescended so far to soften his asperities against the Marrynetts, that \u2014 when Mr. Pen dragon consulted him with no little anxiety, as to his opinion of the steps he had taken with his mining property \u2014 Mr. Featherstone answered in general terms, that if the head of that Liverpool firm had taken his concerns in hand, nothing that capital and business qualities could achieve, would be found wanting. He dissembled also (for perhaps the first time in his life) his little acquaintance with a science in which he was supposed to be an adept, and pretended to listen with understanding and conviction to his guest's elucidations of the strata and geological forma tion of his mountains, which proved so clearly their boundless undeveloped wealth. And after lunch he proposed a walk on the estate, in which Miss Clanbrassey necessarily became the im mediate companion of his gentleman visitor, while he himself, much to his discomfiture, be came the property of the Countess."], [120, "112 HANG-DOG HUT. Of course Madame de la Mazurka would not lose her opportunities. She was already again almost as tired of Featherstone as she had been in her youth, and was considering the next most annoying thing she could do would be to declare she must return to Liverpool, when she made certain Mr. Pendragon would be forced to ac company her. She had, therefore, no great time to lose, and purposely slackened her pace to oblig;e her uncle to ling;er at some distance in the rear. But he rather favoured the man\u0153uvre. She made use of her first opportunities then to thank her uncle with some artificial \u2014 could they have been natural in her? \u2014 tears, for all his goodness to her : for the allowance which had enabled her to live \u2014 not in affluence, not in luxury, it is true \u2014 but in peace and comfort abroad. She laid a particular stress on the word \u2014 imagining that it might lead to some overture to increase the stipend, on the Squire's part, in expensive England. But she found it only elicited from him an inquiry, if she thought she should still need the three hundred a year now her brother, the Colonel, was returning to set up a house and home for her? To which"], [121, "113 HANG-DOG HUT. she vehemently replied, that she had not the slightest reliance whatever on any provision so very selfish a man as Kilpatrick Clanbrassey had always shown himself to be, would make for her, or any one he was not absolutely obliged to do it for. And irritated at so inconsiderate a suggestion, which she ascribed to Rosanna's trickery, to keep the whole \" plunder of her uncle\" to herself, she thought she was giving her a telling tit-for-tat when she resumed, by remarking to Mr. Featherstone- \u2014 \" I should re turn with a thousand times more joy to your own cherished roof, dear uncle, which so many years of exile have endeared to me hourly more and more, in association with the charming re collections of departed youth and its pleasures !

But at the same moment the shadow of a mean-looking man, partly wrapped in an old plaid, and carrying a kind of wallet on a stick over his shoulder, \u2014 indeed, shabby as a beggar in his attire \u2014 passed before them ; and the Squire, suddenly halting, turned and faced his unpleasant bailiff, who was coming with singular closeness on their heels. By some chance \u2014 though Mr. Featherstone himself had suggested a visit to his moors, to estimate the promise of the then nigh-at-hand grouse-shooting \u2014 the company were now on their way towards the boggy tract of country"], [123, "HANG- DOG HUT. 115 called \" The Moss.\" They were on a narrow sandy roadway, running through a maze of furze and fern, on a high reach of hilly land which overlooked the dreary and extensive expanse in question towards the sea. It looked all the. drearier, perhaps, for the bright down-shining of the sun overhead, and the beautiful blue gleaming of the waters beyond. Miss Clan brassey and Mr. Pendragon were considerably ahead of the other two, on a knoll shaded by a few remarkable Scotch firs, of the blackest- hued green, which advanced like a promontory over a deep chasm of rock and sandstone, separating the elevated land from the swamp. Even from this point only a remote view of \" Hang-Dog Hut\" could be caught ; but it was a truly mourn ful and desolate-looking abode for a human habitation, thatched almost to the ground, and perched like a sentry-box on an opposite point of view towards the sea, in the midst of a tangle of pools and peat-diggings which it seemed diffi cult to traverse without an occasional immersion, no one could tell how deep, in the black slush and drainage. A few starved and discoloured looking sheep were, however, feeding, scattered b \u2014 2"], [124, "116 HANG-DOG HUT. over this waste, \u2014 nibbling, with little gratifica tion to appetite, at its scant oases of coarse grass and rushes, and brambly fern. It seemed natural enough, therefore, that Bailiff Blackmore should be retracing his way from an excursion to the Hall Farm along this rough path. What surprised and annoyed Mr. Featherstone so particularly was the stealthy manner of his approach, which must have enabled him to hear much of the foolish Countess's remarks on Rosanna's prospects. Or if he had not noticed on whom he was intruding so closely, there was something still more annoying in the absorbed attention the bailiff must have been devoting to the foremost pair, to stumble thus upon a personage whom he was not likely wilfully to seek to come acioss. His irritable temper kindled by these conjoint causes, Mr. Featherstone angrily exclaimed, \" Upon my word ! is that you, Mr. Blackmore? You seem soon recovered from your attack ! But why do you not give yourself a holiday in Scotland, as 1 particularly requested you should, while )Our system of management, and \u2014 and"], [125, "117 HANG DOG HUT. your accounts (!) are competently examined ?

This did not greatly please her, it may be thought, after the efforts she had made to win upon the Welsh gentleman's attention per sonally.

At all events, the Countess determined that Rosanna should not remain ignorant of her bailiff's im pertinence. She did her sister a service, however, without intending it, by the prompt measures she took to that effect. W7hen the party returned to the Hall, and the ladies had retired to dress for dinner in Miss Clanbrassey's apartment, the affectionate Philip pina fell to work at once, congratulating her sister on the immense improvement visible in her style of \" decoration \" since she had been at Liverpool, even though she still kept no \" woman \" about her to attend to her toilette.

But when she liked, she could exercise a most extra ordinary control over the externals of emotion. \" What do you mean, dear ?\" she inquired, quite carelessly. \" But you are right about the improvement dress makes ! I don't think any woman should neglect it so much as I have ; but in this lonesome village, with only one's uncle to see one \u2014 How different you would look, for example, if you did not dress so beautifully !

And, after all this, still she could not deny herself the woman's triumph and refutation of adding : \" I think it is not very likely I shall contribute in any manner to the annoyance of a gentleman of Mr. Pendragon's position, who, on so short an acquaintance, has conceived regard enough for me to offer me marriage !\" \" Already !\" \" Already.\" \" Grand Dieu !

But undoubtedly what she had heard prepared her better for explanations with her uncle, which his impatient character, and the grievous anxiety awakened in his mind, compelled him to require at once ; so very inop portunely, indeed, that it was precisely as Miss Clanbrassey was descending to ascertain that all was going well for the dinner with her terrified country cooks, when the Squire darted out of his study upon her, and requested her to walk in for a couple of moments and tell him what, in the name of all that was wonderful, that d d beast Blackmore could mean by .

To be sure this cloud would only have been the condensing of those light vapours raised by the Countess's intimations of her uncle's selfish wish to keep his niece to himself, and hinder her from forming any connexion likely to remove her from his own service and obedience. Mr. Pendragon could scarcely be said as yet to be aware of the existence of his rival : much less could the haughty Welsh gentleman conceive for a moment the existence of a rival in the person of a mean underling, who took the wages of his betrothed's uncle in the capacity of little better than a domestic. But"], [158, "150 A DECISIVE INTERVIEW. he was none the less pleased to find that the only apprehension he could entertain was un likely to be realized; and that, while he felt almost assured Rosanna had communicated the purport of his recent interview with her, the cordiality, respect, and general benignancy of Mr. Featherstone's manner, had rather in all respects increased than diminished. Rosanna's own demeanour was singularly ap propriate to the circumstances under which her uncle and lover were at liberty to suppose her placed. She was calm and quiet ; even more than was usually the case with her; while a kind of brightness of some deep inner joy seemed to beam through her whole frame and irradiate it, like the sunshine through some medium only in part too dense to be pierced by the beam. Madame de la Mazurka was the sole person who did not appear very greatly to relish the state of things. She ate well, but seemed un easy and out of place, and willing to relieve the company of her presence as soon as possible.

But Rosanna drew him back with almost a species of violence. \"Do not interfere, Mr. Pendragon,\" she said. \" The man is in reality more than half a mad man, and is often in a state of intoxication ! But he is best managed by those who under stand his peculiarities.

She took and crushed it with a wild gesture in the palm of her hand ; but he said to her in a darkly savage tone, \" Read and reply, or I will hand the duplicate one to Mr. Featherstone, and he will know why you refuse.\" Meanwhile the two gentlemen, quite amazed, examined their scrolls. And these scrolls proved to be notices, warning them each and both, jointly and severally, from trespassing on the \"ma rishes \" or moors known as Featherstone Moss, then and at all future times, saving when, as by ancient custom and right reserved, it was lawful"], [163, "A DECISIVE INTERVIEW. 155 for the Lords of the Manor of Featherstone, or their assigns, to pursue the wild game called grouse, between the Haugh and the sea, on the reclaimable land occupied by Abednego Black more, under a bond of agreement, the exact date of which was given, on the said Manor and Moss of Featherstone.

And then she read these awful words : \u2014 \" Leave the company with me the moment you have read these words, and hear what I have got to say to you on the discovery I have made of the kind of old gentleman geologist, who was to be of so much service to me in the draining of the Moss ; or to-morrow with the dawn I set off for Liverpool, to commence an action against you for breach of promise of marriage, by de manding a specific performance of your promise verbal, on the oath of my body \u2014 Abednego Blackmore.\" Mr. Featherstone was so petrified with surprise"], [164, "156 A DECISIVE INTERVIEW. and anger, that he could only look at his niece for an explanation, as he placed the document he had received in her hand. He made a ges ture at the same moment to take her letter in exchange, but she tore it into a thousand frag ments at the instant.

He looked and felt like a creature under the direct thrall of destiny ; like a criminal, who, apparently un shackled and unconstrained, but aware of an irresistible compelling force at hand, walks of his own accord after the executioner to the place of doom.

But when the shaking bailiff had obeyed orders, and turned again to face her \u2014 lividly pale, with his teeth absolutely rattling with nervous agitation in his head \u2014 it seemed as if some kind of pity mingled with her anger and contempt. At all events, the asperity of her manner was some what qualified, and there was a marked lowering in the tone of her voice, as she said : \" What ails you, man ! then, that you tremble so ?

Unscrewing the top of this, he took three apparently measured sips, though he used the judgment of experience only for the quantity, and replaced it with a kind of rapturous cluck of the lips, and a deep sigh of relief, as the calming elixir passed into its new receptacle. Miss Clanbrassey watched the whole move ment with a peculiar intensity of observation. Insomuch that Blackmore, though puzzled and doubtful as to the meaning in her fixed but glassy stare, timorously inquired : \" But wad ye no like a few drops yersel', miss ?

There was really a considerable pause of utter silence while she thus gazed. Then it seemed as if some sudden start of resolution and decision came upon her, and woke her up as from a painful trance. \" If such is your resolution, Blackmore \u2014 ifyou are so unreasonably determined on my ruin, as well as your own, as you seem \u2014 of course, I must aban don all such expectations as, I acknowledge, you are right in imagining I was looking to as an extrication from the deplorable position in which I am placed.

Blackmore chuckled hugely. \" I've bullied her fairly enough into it now !\" he muttered, rubbing his coarse hands together. \" And to think what a slippery trick the jade was playing me !

Miss Clanbrassey had, meanwhile, received a candle from Dobson, who had been appointed as a sort of intermediate sentinel between the Cedar Parlour and the study, in case any per sonal need of protection should arise. For, singularly enough, as Mr. Pendragon thought, the Squire declared his niece was far better qualified to carry out a settlement of affairs with her bailiff than himself or anyone else ; and he declined interference, and almost with rude im perativeness forbade any \" stranger's meddling \" in the matter. It was the use of this word that induced Mr. Pendragon to reply very warmly that he con ceived himself to have something more than a \" stranger's\" right to assist in the protection of Miss Rosanna Clanbrassey ! And then Madame de la Mazurka, unable to restrain her nature, immediately broke out with \u2014 \" Oh, yes, dear uncle ! Oh, yes, dear Mr. Pendragon !

Please allow me to devote my exclusive attention \u2014 so far as listening goes \u2014 to Dobson at this moment !\" he continued, busying himself thus. The haughty Welsh gentleman had good reason to be surprised, and offended even, at so extraordinary a postponement of his claims on notice to the doings of an insolent underling, and at Mr. Featherstone's careful housemaid like p oceedings at the moment. He rose in dignantly, and walked with evident disgust to the window, where Madame de la Mazurka imme diately joined him, to offer some still stranger, undertoned apologies for her uncle's curious be haviour. \" He is a man of one idea at all times, as I told you, Mr. Pendragon ! \u2014 very penurious \u25a0 \u2014 and this affair is one of pounds, shillings, and pence !\" she remarked. \" And, besides, my uncle is justly exasperated at my sister's folly in allowing him to sign all sorts of unconsidered papers that, I believe, place his estate in a sort of way at the man's mercy, unless some legal"], [181, "173 ALL FOR LOVE. remedy can be found.

She entered the chamber, however, also : locked the door, and, crossing it swiftly, with out suffering a footfall to be heard, to a toilette table, drew out a ring of small keys, and unlocked a casket that stood upon it. There were some valuable jewels within, the gifts of her uncle ; but Miss Clanbrassey's business was not with"], [182, "174 ALL FOR LOVE. them.

Yet not on such rational scores of suspicion as he might well have had ! \" I thought you were only palavering me over, and might perhaps be fool enough to do yourself a mischief, rather than not cheat me in the end !\" he muttered, as he thought, playfully.

And, considering the violence of the emotions she had undergone, she succeeded in doing so with a wonderful ex ternal appearance of calm and composure. Whether this was effected by the support of the horrible hope she had reason to cherish, or whether it was simply the sublimed tranquillity of despair, it would be hard to say.

Could she retrieve the damning paper she had been obliged to sign, and deliver into the possession of her victim ising victim, all the rest could easily be ex plained and accounted for. W'hat more likely, indeed, than that a despe rate man should commit suicide?

Might it not be very possible still, and with out offence, to obtain his departure with the Countess ? It was so essential a point, that Miss Clan brassey determined to hazard something even in the way of offence to effect it. She had the idea in her head when she re-entered the Cedar Parlour. Circumstances, here, however, wore no very favourable aspect. She found that Madame de la Mazurka, wearied of her protracted absence, had declared she could wait no longer for tea, or anything, and had gone up-stairs to put on her bonnet and shawl while the carriage was getting ready. The two gentlemen were sitting opposite each other, quite silent, with each an untasted glass of claret before him, and looking with moody anxiety towards the door, expecting her return.

The expectant parties certainly revived a little at Miss Clanbrassey's cheerful tone on her return. \" I have to beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Pen dragon,\" she said, \" for my long absence.

I never saw any creature go away so crestfallen and downhearted as this fellow, from a dis cussion he entered upon so insolently and tri umphantly.

Intoxication is one of them !\" retorted Rosanna, and in a tone of retort, too, for she was chafing with the inward agony of her feelings, thus stretched upon the rack. \" I should have thought the man, then, in a very unfit state for conference with a lady,\" was the sharp reply. \" I \u2014 I did not notice the circumstance until I had committed myself to the interview : above all things, then, I dreaded any irritating inter ference,\" Miss Clanbrassey answered, in a meeker and more appealing tone to her newly plighted"], [196, "188 EXPLANATIONS THAT DON'T EXPLAIN. lover ; \" and can you not imagine, Mr. Pen dragon,\" she continued, still more soothingly, \"that aware of the too high and generous opinion you have formed of my abilities, I should desire to veil from you the deplorable oversights I have committed in this transac tion?\" Mr. Pendragon bowed, and looked and felt both soothed and gratified. Mr. Featherstone himself seemed to consider there was some cogencv in the argument addressed to himself. \"The rascal shall have till daybreak with his wheezy lungs, then,\" he said. \" Nut an hour longer !

And daybreak came very early in August. But worse than that. Mr. Pendragon, with his national irascibility and relish for a fray, declared that in that case he should make it a point to attend Mr. Featherstone, as his aide-de camp, in the clearance. \" 1 consider myself insulted also by the fellow !\" he said. \" When I had scarcely made my appearance on his land \u2014 if it is his land \u2014 to serve me with notice against trespass, and in forms so insolent !\" \" I trust not\u2014 I hope you will not think of such a thing, Mr. Pendragon,\" said Rosanna, quite desperate at this addition to her fears and calamities. \" On the contrary, I wish you most earnestly to return at once to Liverpool, and remain there until this whole unhappy affair is settled.

At the same time she dared still less attempt to conceal it, or make away with it.

They descended then to the Cedar Parlour, where they found Mr. Pendragon impatiently pacing up and down the chamber, and not dis guising his hurry to be gone ; while Mr. Feather stone, contrary to the laws of civility and his customary habits, sat lost in gloomy silence, anxiously expecting the relief of the departure also. And now I am very far from alleging, or insinuating, that Madame de la Mazurka had any malicious design in what she did, or pur posed any species of expose of her sister's ail ments and violent remedies either to her uncle or Mr. Pendragon. But it is the case, that as soon as she reached the hearth, and was pre paring to take a fond farewell of her uncle, she held her bag so that the prussic acid bottle dropped out, and fell with a clash to the marble, and shivered of course to pieces on it. \" Bless me ! what is that ?

Mr. Featherstone an nounced his intention of clearing the property of him and his without farther delay ; and declaring that he took upon himself the whole responsi bility of the proceeding, received from Ullathorn a very hearty assurance that his Honour might depend on the young men doing whatever he might require in the case, with perfect indiffer ence to whosoever else it might please or dis please beside.

Mr. Featherstone seemed mechanically to stoop to assist in the effort, as if to prove his own innocence of any prying curiosity in the matter \u2014 putting the fragments, as he found them, in his niece's bed-candlestick, with a sort of open handed gesture, as much as to say, \" You see I"], [230, "222 A NIGHT OF TERRORS. am concealing; nothing;.\" But on a sudden his eye was caught by a word \u2014 by two words \u2014 by three \u2014 on one of those large round-handed scrips \u2014 breach \u2014 promise ! \u2014 marriage !

For only reply, she snatched them from him, and conveyed them at once to the flame of the candle. \" Haven't I told you the man was mad ? \u2014 didn't you tell Mr. Pendragon the same your self?\" she muttered hoarsely, and with a glare of defiance and fury in her eyes that amazed \u2014 perhaps terrified \u2014 Mr. Featherstone. \" You go on very strangely, Miss Clanbrass ey,\" he remarked, taking up his own candle. \" I have heard that your grandfather, by the father's side, the famous rake of the Regency \u2014 Hell-fire Clanbrassey, as he was called \u2014 died a madman !

That is to say, she carried up two baskets of plate at an energetic tramp past her uncle's door ; which he could probably hear through all its thickness. And then she locked the strong door at the end of her own communicating corridor. Only she locked her self out \u2014 not in ! If her absence should be discovered, she thought, then it would only be supposed that she was in her chamber, and took no notice of external application in her sleep, so separated from the rest of the household as it was.

Black satin boots were certainly ill-adapted for such a transit ! Yet she felt unwilling to return either for them, or others, to renew the noise of locking and unlocking doors, and attract notice in that way to her doings. In this perplexity her eye fell upon her uncle's Wellingtons (Mr. Featherstone always wore Wellingtons, in defiance of changed modes, and brass-laced inventions of post-reformed eras) which he had put off when his guests retired. He had a small foot for a man \u2014 Rosanna a large one for a woman. She made up her mind at once to put on these, and did so with very little trouble. Then closing the parlour door and putting out her light, she groped her way rather awkwardly to a window and opened the well secured shutters.

Everything seemed lighted up as if by a sadder day \u2014 even the black yew tree in the middle of the courtyard showed like a child's Christmas-tree in the glisten of the leaves, behung with chandelier-like drops of dew. Rosanna felt immediately that in her white cashmere robe she would become a most notice able and distinct figure wherever she went in that strong beam. It was unlikely, but she certainly might by accident come upon some stray villager, or other night-wanderer like her self. She would thus attract the most imme diate attention, which she would find it impossi ble to elude in any covert, with that betraying white glaring in the moonlight, retire as much from any chance observation as she might. To be sure, she might be taken for an apparition in that superstitious and haunted country-side. But that was a security of very doubtful re liance indeed !

That and his shady wide-awake would give her an appearance at a distance of some gamekeeper or shepherd out on legitimate business connected with the duties of either office. Her tall stature gave her also a manlike appearance. No sooner had she formed the notion than she executed it. Stepping out of the window then, she care fully drew the shutters after her as close as she could to the panes, and closed it to prevent the intrusion of any unusual draught of air or noise ; and then found herself suddenly almost knocked down by the impetuous caresses of the huge mastiff in the courtyard, which probably mistaking her for a moment for his master, heaped on her this rough fondling. But as rapidly discovering his mistake he drew off, and began growling and showing his terrible teeth, until with an imperious gesture and ejaculation, \" Down, Neptune, down !\" the animal seemed to admit Miss Clanbrassey's right to be there, and even slunk off in dismay to his kennel, as if"], [237, "A NIGHT OF TERRORS 229 he recognised one whose severities of discipline he had experienced. She was thus rid of further trouble with the mastiff, but felt an uncomfortable doubt whether she had not been obliged to raise her voice so loudly as to challenge observation within the house.

She seemed to herself to glide, not walk ; and she became for the first time con scious, as it were, of the ground, and of the use she was putting her limbs to, in speeding over it, when more than a mile of moonshiny open uphill and down-vale pasture-lands were left behind, and she entered under the black motion less shadows of a pine-wood bordering both sides of the way, with a thick underwood of bramble and fern, which she knew straggled downwards rapidly to the watery maze where Featherstone Beck spread itself, like the thongs of a whip, into numerous channels ; lost in the general hoggings beyond to the eye, but doubtless find ing its way, by tricks and windings of its own, to the kindred washings of the Mersey on its shore.

She could not remember ; but it seemed so improbable she should have neglected so neces sary a precaution, that she fell at once upon con sidering whether the whine of the animal, vexed to find itself shut up behind her steps, could reach her over the distance she had traversed.

After that, the windings of the Moss still continued familiar to her, and she knew she could traverse them with ease, under cover for the most part of hillocks of furze and bushy wastes, traversed by trenches and sunk peat-holes, dangerous to a stranger, but not to her. Moreover, the bog being chiefly in the hollow of an elevated piece of tableland, stretching thence to the sea-shore, the rest of the track lay for the most part in shadow and obscurity below.

I scarcely know whether it was a fortunate circumstance for Miss Clanbrassey that the notion never once crossed her mind of Mr. Pendragon being the owner of this fastened-up steed, returned on a midnight gallop from Liver pool, determined to ascertain the meaning of the strange circumstances he had witnessed, and the suspicions raised in his mind, in a direct personal interview with the occasion of them ! It seemed a thing so out of all calculation of misfortune ! So unlikely even with a man of the sturdiest nerves, after all Mr. Pendragon had heard of the bloodthirsty desperation and crazi ness of Bailiff Blackmore ! But there are some men whose resolution is only roused to more indignant self-assertion by the notion of personal danger attached to any demand upon it. Mr. Pendragon was one of these.

It alarmed her even amidst the complication of her other terrors, and added wings to her speed. But, heaven and earth ! as she approached she perceived but too plainly that the door of the lonesome abode, where death and murder must by this time fully have done their work, was wide open ! Not only did the glare of the moonlight show it so, but from within there came the red glow of a low fire of peat smoul dering on the hearth. As there was no fastening to the door in general but a latch, unless when a wedge was driven over it, within or without, there had been no difficulty for anyone to open it; and in this"], [245, "237 A NIGHT OF TERRORS. latter case Rosanna was aware of a peculiar trick, by lifting the door on its hinges, to re move the obstruction.

Rigid and bolt upright in his chair before a small table, strewed with papers, account-books, and some coarse articles of diet, sat Bailiff Blackmore \u2014 evidently a corpse, by the ghastly pallor of his fixed countenance and the unmean ing glassy glare in his eyes, visible in the flicker of a lamp, formed by a wick in a cracked jelly pot of grease, which was fast dying out beside him. And gazing in breathless horror at him, and at a paper partially written over, on which the dead man seemed to have been tracing some pencil marks as he became fixed in the immov ability of death, stood Mr. Pendragon, of Pen dragon Mohr ! And Rosanna Clanbrassey knew by the instinct of despair that the open paper before her dead enemy, which Mr. Pendragon was endeavouring to peruse for some explanation of the horror he witnessed, was her Promise of Marriage to the wretched man\u2014 the ink of the"], [246, "238 A NIGHT OF TERRORS. signature hardly yet dry, and the attesting date of some five hours' back interview before him ! W7ith a wild shriek Rosanna turned to fly, but found even her flight barred by the sudden emergence on the scene of Mr. Featherstone and his huge dog ! Mr. Featherstone was only dressed in his trousers and shirt ; he had on no boots \u2014 no coat \u2014 he looked like a madman in every other respect \u2014 his hair erect \u2014 his eyes starting out of his head ! It was the mastiff, however, that stopped the unfortunate woman by its furious bark and raging advance direct in her path. Mr. Featherstone had scarcely strength to tug the creature back by the collar, as he exclaimed, \" Great God ! Rosanna ! is it you \u2014 here \u2014 at midnight \u2014 at the villain's badger-hole?\" But she had none to reply ! All the might of that powerful spirit had deserted the unhappy woman in so overwhelming a combination of disasters, and she sunk senseless on the ground at her uncle's feet ; the last sounds she heard, with any meaning or sense attached to them, for many weeks after, being Mr. Pendragon's exclamation from the hut \u2014 \" Good God !

But then, again, all she had witnessed had puzzled her like an enigma for a solution, and though her curiosity was much excited, she could not bear to fatigue her brains with vain attempts to fathom the mystery. Scarcely disguising her indignation and dis dain, she set down Mr. Pendragon at a street near his hotel, by his own particular desire, after a slight apology for not completing the journey to Liverpool Palace. But the rest of the way thither was lined with houses, and so public a road that no farther need of protection could be assumed, and Mr. Pendragon announced him self to be unusually fatigued with the day's ex cursion. \" You cannot be more so than I am !\" replied the Countess, maliciously, and adding : \" but you have surely made the journey worth your pains, by its favourable results to your future happiness, Mr. Pendragon, in my sister's ac ceptance of your extremely desirable proposals.

The chiefs of this faction did not concern themselves much perhaps over Philippina's ac count of her shamefully neglectful reception by her uncle. But it excessively annoyed both Mr. and Mrs. Marrynett to find that their magnifi cent \" turn-out,\" in the equipage way, had not extorted a single word of admiration from the"], [251, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 243 \" glumpy old Squire.\" And the former was, in secret, bitterly vexed and mortified to find that even the birth of a Son and Heir had not diminished the rancorous old grudge borne to him by the county gentleman, nor secured him any overtures to a reconciliation. Under these circumstances he smiled grimly to hear that Mr. Pendragon had proposed to the Squire's favourite niece, and would doubtless be accepted, as the two \" strange old fellows' \" ideas and opinions went as pat with each other as globules of quick silver. And yet, the Countess had not the common sense and feeling for her sister to con ceal the extraordinary facts relating to Bailiff Blackmore's refusal to part with his stewardship, or leave the Featherstone property. Nay, she repeated his remarkable expression that he would never leave it unless with Miss Rosanna Clan brassey as his bride, and described the whole singular scene after dinner in the Cedar Parlour. To all which Mr. Marrynett listened with greedy ears, and concluded with a commentary that startled even the mischievous reporter. \" Hang it ! any man of the world can see how the wind blows among all this straw and 16\u20142"], [252, "244 THREADS IN THE FLYING WTOOF OF TIME. chaff; and if I don't put Pendragon up to my views about Featherstone's old maid and her bailiff, call me a d \u2014 d good-natured fellow to my enemies, and a d \u2014 d bad 'un to my friends !

You might have left our side of the family some vestiges of respectable connexion ! What will he begin to think of us all just now, do you fancy ?

But, thank goodness ! that clerk-fellow and his gawky have arranged, I hear, to get married as soon as possible on their fifty thousand pounds, and go on a wedding tour to Australia. Where, I hope truly, they will remain till I send for them home again !\" The love of gossip, however, hindered Madame the Countess from appreciating any harm in her chit-chat from the Haugh for some time after. But Mr. Marrynett himself had speedily occasion to find that the projected alli ance between his sister-in-law and fellow-specu lator was not likely to work in a way to increase his influence with the latter gentleman. Mr. Pendragon called upon him at his office, and definitively declined borrowing any more money of him upon his remaining mountainous terri tory, in order to extend his liabilities in the mining scheme. He looked so pale and ill, and yet spoke with such determination on the point, that Mr. Mar rynett was seized with a not unreasonable notion that the Welsh chieftain suspected his ultimate designs upon his property, and had been put up"], [254, "246 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. to the withdrawal, and the mistrust he evinced, by Mr. Featherstone's malicious interpretations and expositions of his own ideas of his character and objects. Highly exasperated at this conviction, and at the recalcitrance of his intended victim, Mr. Marrynett thereupon directly expressed his con clusions as to the reasons of his friendly co speculator's shyness and withdrawal, which would go far to endanger the whole speculation. It needed a constant propping in the market, he asserted, for a time, until some great discovery was made of the ores so convincingly demon strated to exist in the Pendragon Mohr, when shares would fly to the skies at once. But as Featherstone had behaved so un'ansome by him, and tried to prejudice his friend against him \u2014 still he was too much that friend's friend to see him trapped into a marriage with a girl that was spoken of as that Haugh \"old girl\" was all over the country side, for taking up with a dirty old Scotch bailiff, and playing into his hands until the stupid Squire had scarcely any ownership left over his own property ! To be sure, she might now repent of her folly, have"], [255, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 247 taken a fancy to have a gentleman for her hus band, or to quiet her uncle's just resentment and suspicions ; but for his part \u2014 from all he heard But there Mr. Pendragon interrupted these unkinsmanlike reflections by informing Mr. Marrynett\u2014 turning deadly pale as he spoke, either with anger or some other emotion \u2014 that he was entirely mistaken in all he had stated. That Mr. Featherstone had only spoken of him (Mr. Marrynett) personally to praise his great business abilities, and had made no allusion whatever to any unfair designs or underhand proceedings of any sort to be apprehended from him. Only Mr. Pendragon's short experience of business, and business people, had convinced him that he was quite unfit and incompetent to figure in the transactions they conducted to ad vantage, and if it were possible he should be happy to retire altogether from the speculative pursuits he had engaged in \u2014 probably too deeply to do so at once. But for what related to Miss Clanbrassey, he begged Mr. Marrynett to un derstand that he would never suffer a single word to that lady's disparagement to be uttered"], [256, "24S THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. in his presence without calling the calumniator to a severe account ! And all the more em- phatically, since her acceptance of an offer he had honoured himself by making her was a sufficient refutation of any such absurd reports as seemed to have reached the ears of Miss Clanbrassey's relatives in Liverpool. Although, he was deeplv grieved to add, Miss Clanbrassey had been induced, by her uncle's unwillingness to part with the main comfort and support of his old age, to retract her consent and definitely to decline his proposals. But certainly not on account of a wretched, embezzling man-of- business person like this Bailiff Blackmore, since he had the best authority for believing that the wretched fellow had committed suicide, on find- ing his employers were determined to have his accounts thoroughly investigated, and to turn him out of his situation, whatever expense and trouble it might cost them \u2014 Miss Clanbrassey quite as much as the Squire himself, who was as indignant as a man could possibly be at the tyrannous misbehaviour and proceedings of his servant towards himself and his tenantry. This conversation took place on the day after"], [257, "249 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. the visit to Featherstone Hall of the Countess and her undevoted squire of dames. And Mr. Marrynett, having been away from his home all the morning, had not heard a word about this alleged suicide, and he was much surprised to hear of it. Sufficient time had, however, been allowed for Mr. Pendragon to receive despatches containing the truths he announced since the discoveries in question had been made. For on his return, Mr. Marrynett found his wife and Madame de la Mazurka speculating over an article in the \" Evening Mercury\" which mentioned, in a cursory manner, that a Mr. Abednego Blackmore, bailiff and land steward to Ferdinand Featherstone, Esq., of the Haugh, had been found dead in a small cottage he inhabited alone, on the verge of the extensive marshes known as the \" Moss.\" In a rather remarkable manner also, as Mr. Featherstone, being very much discontented with the conduct of the deceased in the above capacities, had determined to try his right to the land he occu pied under an alleged agreement with himself as proprietor, by ejecting him from the abode he had taken possession of against his declared"], [258, "250 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. wish, and had made up a party of his tenants and servants for the purpose. But on the arri val of this company, the unfortunate man was found dead. A medical man who was called in gave it as his opinion that he had died of an overdose of laudanum, to wThich the bailiff was declared to have been excessively addicted, as a palliative to a disorder in the chest to which he was subject. And as there was no evidence to the contrary, though strong suspicions were at first entertained, very serious defalcations having been detected in the accounts of the deceased with his employers, the jury had returned a verdict to that effect. Nor were the public in general ever very much more enlightened on the subject by the persons who alone were qualified to clear up the mvsterv. The only food for conjecture offered to the nearest observers \u2014 if the villagers at the Haugh could be styled so \u2014 lay in the fact that Miss Clanbrassey was taken ill, and remained so for several weeks after the event described, of a brain-fever. Not, however, solely on account of the agitation and concern she had shared in"], [259, "251 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. this uncomfortable affair, but from a circum stance which it was found impossible to conceal \u2014 namely, that she had taken to walking in her sleep whenever she was unusually excited ; and being rendered particularly so by the visit of a sister and a friend whom she had not seen for a long time, had strayed abroad on the very night of the bailiff's catastrophe, in a most ex traordinary costume, and caught a dreadful cold. But the concussion of the brain which produced her fever was traced by the doctor employed \u2014 a very learned man \u2014 to the un happy circumstance that Mr. Featherstone, accidentally overhearing his niece at her prepara tions to go out (she actually put on her uncle's boots and plaid, and opened the parlour shutters fast asleep !), had followed and overtaken her on a midnight ramble on the very verge of the precipitous \" Scaur,\" and in his alarm had in cautiously thrown himself upon and awakened her too suddenly. It was natural of Mr. Featherstone to put the best varnish he could on the unhappy events ; but I doubt if any but a Welsh gentleman would have taken his share in the risk, and per-"], [260, "252 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. haps conscientious objections, that might exist to the concealment of the real facts of the case. But, after all, the bailiff's pencilled denunciation of his unfortunate mistress as his murderess might not have been true, and Mr. Pendragon probably gave the lady the benefit of the doubt when he handed it over to Mr. Featherstone, and watched, without resistance, what ensued \u2014 that the Squire put it into the low peat fire on Bailiff Blackmore's hearth, and burned it till not even a black floating shred could remain. And having once accepted this compassionate ignoring part, Mr. Pendragon had only to stretch his conscience a little further, and cover the ignominy of the woman whose very crime towards another demonstrated the excess of her preference for himself, and preserve from total wreck and despair a man whom he es teemed, by giving the plausible explanation of his withdrawal with which he favoured Mr. Marrynett. Still no doubt the whole affair exercised a most painful and harmful effect on Mr. Pen dragon's mind, and continued to persecute him with misgivings as to the morality and right of"], [261, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 253 the course he had pursued, until other disorders combined to overwhelm him ; and he did in reality in the end commit the act which he had assisted in fathering upon Bailiff Blackmore. On the complete failure and collapse of the great Pendragon Mohr mining speculation, after an expenditure of enormous sums to open it out (water, from an unknown source, burst in, and entirely destroyed the works), and when Mr. Marrynett's own necessities (so he said) had obliged him to foreclose his extensive mortgage on the Pendragon property, Mr. Pendragon shot himself dead at an inn in Carnarvon, on his way to London for legal advice on the subject. And, perhaps, it would be as well to continue out to a conclusion here the story of the unhappy \" old maid aunt \" of the Miss Marrynetts ; es pecially as it has little further connexion with their experiences ; nothing remaining for report henceforth but the slow catastrophe of that sombre tragedy of an existence. Was it the skill of her physician \u2014 the strength of her constitution, in which life was planted firmly as the gnarled roots of the oak in a stony soil \u2014 the unwearied care of her uncle \u2014 or the"], [262, "254 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. vengeance of heaven on a great crime \u2014 that restored Rosanna Clanbrassey, after a fearful struggle with the destroying agencies at work within her, to the intolerable sense of all she had been, and was, and must be, to the close of her dismal days ? For even the refuge of Madness, which her uncle silently prayed for on her behalf, was denied to the strong-brained woman, whose in tellectual powers had been so unnaturally deve loped and fed at the expense of all the more womanly part of her nature, which might have preserved her from disgrace and crime so un womanly in its whole origin and end. That mercy of madness was not granted to the unfortunate Miss Clanbrassey \u2014 even for her uncle's sake alone to be wished, whom it might have spared the still more terrible and gloomy ordeal awaiting him in the conscious society of a woman stained with such offences, and whose every thought was darkened by the perpetual shadows of a woe and of a guilt so terrible, though not otherwise expiated before an earthly tribunal. The veidict of the jury in Abednego Black-"], [263, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 255 more's case threw suspicion on no one, unless upon the unfortunate deceased himself. He was safely buried in a churchyard noted for its quick destruction of the mortality confided to its keeping, at a distance from Featherstone. No friends or relatives stepped forward to claim a right to pay him' any funeral honours, or to inquire too narrowly into the circumstances of his sudden doom. Not even to demand his inheritance. To be sure this was a very slight one \u2014 and was so advertised in the Scotch and English papers. Of all the considerable savings he had boasted to Miss Clanbrassey, not a trace was to be found. Mr. Featherstone carefully searched the papers of the defunct, to find some clue to his connexions (why else ?) in order to hand over to them the few personal articles of any value that were in the bailiff's possession at his death. But he made no discovery, with the single ex ception that he lighted on a parchment in a crabbed Scotch law handwriting, which proved to be a decree of separation, a mensa et thoro, of one Abednego MacAnguish from his wife, Janet Moffat, on charges proved to the satis-"], [264, "256 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. faction of the High Court of Justiciary in such cases, in Edinburgh, of gross cruelty (of a dreadful description, shutting her up to starve her), and desertion ; and amercing him in a certain small annual payment for her mainte nance. Where, the decree made no mention ; and it was left entirely to conjecture whether the Scotch wife was alive or not at the time when the audacious bailiff, under a changed name, so outrageously urged his suit with the English lady in the south. The probability besides re maining, that he had fled to England to avoid the small reparation he had been ordained to render to his previous lawful victim in his native land. Would this be a consolation for Rosanna to learn, or an increase of her dread calamity ? Mr. Featherstone, while bestirring himself with a wonderful degree of nerve and resolu tion, in the midst of his niece's first sufferings, to provide against any awkward pieces of evidence that might remain at Hang-Dog Hut, came to no opinion or decision on this point. But for this apprehension it is likely enough he would have left the bailiff's catastrophe to the discovery"], [265, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 257 of somebody else, or of accident, however long either had taken about it. The longer the better, for disconnecting Miss Clanbrassey's midnight sortie with the disastrous coincidence at the Hut. But it required all his own exer tions, with the assistance of Mr. Pendragon, to convey his unconscious kinswoman to a sufficient distance from the place to establish an alibi, and where it would seem likely a somnambulist might have reached. Nor did Mr. Featherstone at all wrong the memory of his departed servant when he plainly intimated to the coroner, that he believed he had committed serious defal cations in his accounts. A very slight scrutiny sufficed to establish this fact, for the villanous bailiff, secure in his influence over Miss Clan brassey, who alone examined them, had taken to plunder his receipts quite openly, and almost made a jest of the pretence of fair book-keeping, in striking his balances, by the impudent charges he made on his own side of the account, to ad just it as he thought proper. At first, indeed, there seemed a great likeli hood that the direful species of oblivion, or jug glery of reality, that madness offers to the over- VOL.

For a long season a frightful raging delirium accompanied the fever on her brain, during which it required the strength of several persons even to keep her in her bed. Her uncle, the doctor, Mrs. Ulla thorn, and Mrs. Ullathorn's vigorous young re lative, were at times over-matched almost in the effort. And it was somewhat singular, but, in spite of the great need of female assistance for a woman in such a deplorable condition, Mr. Featherstone would not suffer any of his niece's relatives of that sex to be sent for from Liver pool. He rejected a suggestion to that effect with a kind of shudder of impatience and dread. \" They are the most frivolous wretches in the world, my niece's female relatives, one and all !\" he exclaimed. \" They would kill her off at once \u2014 they would be studying grimaces at their toilettes, or wondering when dinner would be ready, if the entire universe, except themselves, were in its last agonies !

And do this worthy woman and her gentle- hearted girl leave anything to be desired in the way of attention ?\" In truth, no tenderness, no zeal, no devotion, could equal that of Mr. Featherstone himself in his efforts to preserve his niece, while his own reason assured him she would be better dead. But, besides every other objection, Rosanna's ravings were frequently not of a kind he could bear to run the risk of interpretation by those \" Liverpool hags !\" That was how he spoke of Miss Clanbrassey's charming sisters there. And certainly they would not have implicitly obeyed his wishes, as the Ullathorns did, in leaving the room whenever his niece began to babble strange matters, or to shriek them aloud with her uncle's quivering hands pressed on her burning lips in vain. They would probably only have listened the more resolutely, and have endeavoured to piece the fragments of meaning into some con fessing whole. Even the milder forms of Rosanna's distrac tion were of a terribly suggestive character. During the intervals of exhaustion that followed on some of her severer struggles an extraordi- 17\u20142"], [268, "260 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. nary range of fancies seemed almost always to arise in her mind, and possess her with the notion that the reason of her being in bed, and surrounded by those anxious faces, was that she had become the wife of a beggar-man well known in Featherstone as \" Tinker Tom,\" and was the mother of a child, murdered as soon as born by Mr. Featherstone, her uncle, because it was of so lowly parentage on the father's side, and dis graced its high connexions so ! Mr. Featherstone had strangled it with his own hands, and thrown it down the \" Scaur !\" But he was so good and kind and loving an uncle that no proceedings were to be taken against him on that account. Hanging was so dreadful a death \u2014 so mean, so base a death \u2014 would they subject the noblest gentleman in all the world to so miserable a fate ? And then she w7ould weep for hours, and clasp her hands, and kneel and implore of the kind women who attended her that they would never betray her dearest uncle, nor herself, nor \" Tinker Tom,\" to the knowledge of people in this dreadful matter ; but would let them all go as peaceably as they might to their graves.

Therefore it must be a night when there was no fear of its shining out in that day-like manner as it sometimes did at harvest time. Strangely enough she seemed to remember exactly what time of the year it was, and the species of operations requisite in the fields at that season. But she never once alluded to Bailiff Blackmore, or to Mr. Pendragon, who had promised to return to have some grouse shooting on the 12 th of August.

And for some hours even that was scarcely perceptible. The doctor announced a decisive crisis ; and Mr. Featherstone awaited the result \u2014 a patient, grief-worn male Electra at the feet of an ex hausted female Orestes, tormented by the furies of her crime \u2014 watching for the moment of crisis. For whole days it was thus with the uncle and niece, and no one could even conjecture what was likely to be the upshot, so fixed in deathly repose, with eyes firmly closed, and motionless in every muscle of the large and once expressive face, the unhappy patient lay. The poor gentleman, her uncle, felt or fancied this miserable wreck was his own work \u2014 the deplorable result of a reversed Pygmalion art, to extract the natural warming fire from heaven out of the frame it was bestowed to animate, and make a statue of a living woman.

But he was not prepared for what really hap pened when Rosanna \u2014 after apparently a long twilight glimmering in her returning faculties \u2014 opened her eyes once when Mr. Featherstone was thus alone with her, and looking at him steadily, said \u2014 \" Uncle, I am not mad !

But it was not so. Miss Clanbrassey really meant what she said, mad or sane, and carried out the pro gramme with fearful fidelity. She remained in her uncle's house, after her physical disorder was supposed to be cured, the dark genius of his hearth, which banished all peace and com fort from it with the perpetual shadow of its silent gloom. For she entered into no explanations with the unfortunate Squire after that brief and terrible announcement. It was only by her silence, in deed, that he could guess she remembered the dreadful past. But she evinced no disinclination \u2014 so he heard \u2014 to speak to other people about the disastrous end of Bailiff Blackmore. On the contrary, she inquired the minutest particu lars of the Ullathorns, and seemed quite uncon cerned at what she heard. Or, if concerned, joyfully so. \" He was a terrible nuisance,\" she said. \" He could not have done a kinder thing"], [274, "266 THREADS IN THE FLYING W7OOF OF TIME. to us all than to put himself out of tbe way in the style he did. My uncle was getting angry with me on his worthless account. I allowed him so much power, foolishly enough, but fancy ing he was so clever and \u2014 and honest ! But now that breach is healed also, and uncle and I were never better friends.\" Yet Mr. Featherstone himself, before very long, began to have a vague shadow of appre hension stealing over him, that he had become an object of mute but rancorous distaste and aversion to his niece. It is true she exacted almost constant companionship from him \u2014 hardly suffered him for a long time to be half an hour out of her sight at a time , but when in his company always spoke to him with disdain and asperity, as if she were the bit terly injured and unoffending party of the two. \" You have made me so strange a being \u2014 so curious and outlandish in my manners, being brought up in this village on the outskirts of the world \u2014 that I am unfit for any other society but yours, uncle !\" she would say. \" And I hate to be alone \u2014 I will not be left alone ! Why do"], [275, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 267 you go so much to that stupid lodge-gate now ? Is it to look at the senseless fair face of that girl there ? For shame ! \u2014 an old mza like you, and who brought up a young woman like me \u2014 for I am not old even yet, uncle ! \u2014 to despise everything but books and philosophy.\" In truth, the unlucky Squire grew not to relish by any means those long dreary evenings of the winter that followed that fatal summer, caged in the darksome Cedar Parlour with a gloomy and unhappy woman, who, doing nothing and saying nothing, with large, hollow eyes steadfastly fixed on the piled-up fire in the grate, insisted on his being with her, but made no attempt \u2014 nor tole rated any \u2014 at friendly communion or discourse. In truth, Rosanna took no interest in anything among all the subjects that used once most to attract her attention, real or feigned. Politics, literature, etymological and scientific elucidations \u2014 nothing any longer seemed to have power to engage her mind. Only she would not be left alone. That was the sole burden of her lay. She would not be left alone. And Mr. Feather stone, dreading what the consequence might be if he presumed against his niece's wish in this"], [276, "26S THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. respect, became in a manner the bond-slave and captive of it. As for any confidence longer existing between them, it was quite out of the question. Fancy ing, however, at last that the dreadful gloom in which his niece was continually immersed might be occasioned by remorse, Mr. Featherstone took it into his head he should diminish her feeling on the subject of the doom to which she had consigned her plebeian lover, by making her aware of all his unworthiness. He took an occasion, therefore, to throw out an allusion to him once to his niece, which he thought might awaken her curiosity, without venturing too nigh the dread core of her mystery. \" What a rascal that Blackmore was,\" he ventured one evening to observe to her, as he was affecting to turn over a bundle of the dead bailiff's accounts, \" besides his cheating in the books he kept.\" \" Yes,\" she answered, quietly, \" he sold Mopsy, our best milch cow, had it not been for the lame foot, for twenty-five pounds, and pretended he got next to nothing for her !\" \" And besides that,\" said Mr. Featherstone,"], [277, "269 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. hastily, \" he had a wife in Scotland whom he had shamefully maltreated, and ran away from when he \u2014 when he \" \" When he wooed and wanted to marry Miss Clanbrassey, of Featherstone Haugh : no circumlocution, uncle \u2014 we are alone. He paid pretty dearly for that audacity, however, uncle, as you are well aware. I poisoned him \u2014 put prussic acid \u2014 hydrocyanic acid, as we should call it in our learned way ; but they put it plain on the bottle, there was no mistake: ' Poison \u2014 Prussic Acid' \u2014 in his laudanum ! It could be easily proved still, if need were, by reference to the books of Hellebore and Sage, Pharmaceuti cal Chemists, Birmingham. You see I am mistress of my subject, if you provoke me to an exposition. If I had known that in time, however, it would have been a nice answer to the man's threat of bringing a suit for breach of promise of marriage against me ! You saw the paper, uncle, I signed to that effect, and so did Mr. Pendragon, and it was kind and gene rous of him not to tell, I must say. But nothing can hinder a criminal from confessing of himself, and I bid you beware how you drive"], [278, "270 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. me on the desperation of doing so. If you do not continue very kind and good to me \u2014 it is my only restraint \u2014 and watch over me, and keep me company always, I feel I shall be driven to do that, and all will come out then, and you will be shamed as well as I and poor Pendragon, before all the world.\" On this basis Rosanna Clanbrassey re-erected a tyranny a thousand times more irksome than any she had ever before, in the fulness of her uncle's confidence and blind partiality, estab lished for herself and the bailiff at Featherstone Haugh. That is to say, she resumed the manage ment of everything in the house and about the place, even in a more high-handed and over bearing manner than she had previously, with her first return of strength, and the least oppo sition to her will seemed to irritate her to dis plays little short of the paroxysms of delirium she had exhibited at the height of her malady. Perhaps, indeed, she w-as only superficially cured of that frenzied state of the mind. But she contrived in the end to make herself an ob ject of mingled dread and dislike to her uncle, who found all his good intentions and sacrifices"], [279, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 2/1 taken for nothing, and his home become a place of terror and constraint to him of the most appalling and unhappy kind. No wonder, then, if the poor Squire escaped as often as he could from the shadow of the fearful Nemesis that had overtaken him ; and when he dared, for a few stolen minutes, sunned himself into a calmer and gentler mood in the compassionate smiles and innocent homage of his under-bailiff's lovely young granddaughter, May Ullathorn. But this deplorable condition of affairs was, fortunately for Mr. Featherstone, not destined long to last. Rosanna Clanbrassey's fury of resumed power and tyranny subsided the instant they were no longer resisted, and she perceived that she had achieved the result of rendering herself a mingled object of detestation and fear. This seemed, in fact, to have been her strange purpose during the efforts she had made to re gain her old supremacy, to judge by the sudden collapse that followed on her success. After that, she neglected her regained empire as com pletely, and remained plunged in fits of the pro soundest gloom and despair ; abandoned all her occupations finally, and took to her room, and"], [280, "272 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. then to her bed, without any apparent ailment, but with a fixed determination, which she made no efforts to conceal, of never rising again. \" I cannot keep up this farce any longer, uncle,\" she said to him one day, calmly and rationally enough to all appearance. \" I am dead. What is the use of pretending not to be so? Order my coffin, and let us have no more fuss about the matter. I am wearv, I tell vou, of going about, and feigning to be alive. Put me into it, and bury me, and you shall see I will not stir hand or foot to oppose it.\" And from this rooted fancy she could not be removed ; and of a surety seemed to believe in it herself. For even when the news of Mr. Pendragon's suicide reached her \u2014 which it did through the doctor, who sought to arouse her attention by such a startling piece of news, and knew not how deeply the unhappy woman had once been interested in that gentleman \u2014 she did not seem either moved or excited hy the intelli gence. \" There will be no one left to regret his beautiful wife now in the world !\" she remarked only ; \" children seldom remember very much about a dead mother ; and, besides, Mrs. Pen-"], [281, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WDOF OF TIME. 273 dragon died very young, a very long time ago !

Oh, so dead ! all the time, to my certain know ledge and belief!\" It was in vain to reason with a settled insanity like this ; and, moreover, the unhappy sufferer in a manner wearied out sympathy and con dolence by her harsh and terrible and exacting demeanour, even while she thus maintained herself to be dead. She wearied out even the patient love and remorseful submission of Mr. Featherstone. His man's nature revolted against such excesses of caprice and self-attribution as were exhibited by his niece, in her voluntary confinement, and continual rabid outbursts of tyranny and control. Her very commands against and taunting accusations of his preference for the low-born loveliness of May Ullathorn, produced exactly a contrary effect from what seemed intended. And after awhile, Rosatina VOL. in. 18"], [282, "274 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. Clanbrassey, abandoned to the care of hired attendants, seemed to lose her power to torment and appal her luckless relative altogether. It seemed as if this only was wanting to com plete the overthrow of all hope and energy to struggle against the influences of the extraor dinary kind of existence to which Miss Clan brassey now delivered herself up ; hardly ever quitting her bed, speaking to no one, and finally refusing all food excepting bread and water. It was not found possible to change her resolution in this respect, and that, as she herself bitterly remarked, was in itself a great concession on the part of a person already dead ! She succeeded thus at last in breaking down the strength of her once iron constitution, and without at all diminishing the frightful violence and asperity which obliged all to flee from her but those whose duty compelled them to attend upon her. Without any definite or declared disease that medical skill could discover, a canker seemed to be in the core of Rosanna Clanbras sey's existence, fast wearing down her vital energies, and preparing things for general collapse and ruin."], [283, "275 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. Something might be due, indeed, to the action of the baneful drug in whose use she was once more indulged, in the latter stages of her malady. She complained so of utter sleeplessness, and Mr. Featherstone, aware now of the habits she had acquired, himself suggested to the doctor that she might be allowed the use of opium in unharmful proportions. But what are unharmful proportions in the use of a poison so destructive to the vital powers of man ? and Rosanna's subtlety lay in this, that while by a discontinuance of nourishing food and diet she diminished the resisting strength of her constitution to the insidious operations of her drug, she was allowed to increase the quantities she took to calm the febrile action she exhibited, and the paroxysms of irritation and causeless resentment that drove (as has been said) all not forced to remain in attendance upon her from her side. Mr. Featherstone had grown* \u2014 if the truth must be told \u2014 considerably hardened to the de plorable nature of the case, and by no means so anxious as he had originally shown himself to be, about its probable disastrous consummation. Under the sway of his niece's menaces, he felt 18\u20142"], [284, "276 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. that it would not be possible for him to remove the painful spectacle of degradation and woe for ever established apparently in his home. Nor ought it to be considered altogether a wonderful anomaly of human conduct and reasoning, that fleeing from the terrors of his niece's society and the remembrance of her misconduct, Mr. Fea therstone had formed a project to restore himself to some degree of happiness and human associa tion by doing what he would have condemned in any other person of his age and standing in the world to the uttermost. Yes ; Mr. Feather stone ofthe Haugh \u2014 the proud Mr. Featherstone \u2014 the aristocratic county gentleman par excel lence \u2014 had made up his mind so far to defy the opinion of the world, and fly in the teeth of all his most cherished principles and maxims, as to marry his under-bailiff's blooming daughter at the Lodge-gate ! There was no thought of anything else in his plans on the subject from the very first. His own notions were too honourable as regarded women \u2014 the girl herself was too virtuous \u2014 his purposes and wishes were too completely to restore himself to some species of domestic"], [285, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 277 happiness \u2014 to permit him to form any other projects. The ill success of his grand system had, perhaps, diminished his own respect for the ideas on which he had founded it. Besides all this, it must be said that May Ullathorn's beauty powerfully pleaded in her favour ; her mildness and tenderness of temper \u2014 even her peasant ignorance and girlish simplicity, O heavens ! pleaded with the trainer in languages and sciences of the unhappy Rosanna Clanbrassey. At sixty five, Mr. Featherstone was aware that he was still a good-looking, hale man ; and he had reason, besides any slight personal vanity of the kind, to conceive that he had awakened affection and admiration in his under-bailiff's charming daughter from the moment when he had first interfered in the protection of her family from Bailiff Blackmore's tyranny. Not to trouble one's self to seek too elaborate explanations of what, after all, is a simple enough result of given circumstances, and often enough observed as such, Mr. Featherstone made up his mind to marry young May Ullathorn as soon as ever \u2014 As soon as ever what ? As soon as ever his niece, whom he had"], [286, "278 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. brought up in maxims so opposed to his own example now, should come to the close of her distressing career, which the medical attendant announced as inevitable, if she persisted in the strange condition of existence she had embraced, and had evidently made up her mind not to change by any exertion of her own will, or suf ferance of her own ! How intelligence of this fact came to the knowledge of Rosanna Clanbrassey it is hard to say. She was certainly incapable of gossiping elucidations of the kind with any of her at- tendants. The probability is that at some time when she was believed in a state of stupor, after some heavier dose than usual of her terrible medicine, Mrs. Ullathorn had been misled into the belief that she could neither hear nor un- derstand whispered remarks, and might have indulged in discussing the prospects of her young relative with some one of the servants sharing her watch as nurse. However that might be, it was perfectly plain that the unfortunate Miss Clanbrassey was aware of tbe arrangement, by the allusion she"], [287, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 279 made to it, in her dying moments, to Mr. Fea therstone. A few days before the 12th of August, one year after that fatal midnight excursion to Hang-Dog Hut, and about three months after Mr. Pendragon 's own disastrous end, Rosanna was taken unusually ill shortly after the moon rose. A moon as bright as that which had guided her on her former terrible enterprise. She made a complaint to her nurse that she felt quite paralyzed on a sudden, observing that she thought the moonbeams must be frozen, she felt so deadly cold ! And after a pause, she desired Mrs. Ullathorn to summon her uncle to her apartment \u2014 a request she had not made for a considerable time, nor had he volun teered visits which almost uniformly ended in some explosion of unreasonable passion, akin to the vindictiveness of a settled hatred, on his niece's part. \"Don't be afraid!\" she said to Mrs. Ul lathorn, perceiving her hesitate, \" I am not going to say a word against the match ! On the contrary. But be quick ; I have no time to lose !\""], [288, "2S0 THREADS IN THE FLYING W7OOF OF TIMiS. The good woman, who was of a mild and placable nature herself, complied ; but was so long gone that the unhappy mistress seemed to form her own conceptions of the cause, and when Mr. Featherstone at last unwillingly ar rived, she said to him, \" You come from the Lodge-gate, uncle?\" But without any signs of anger and asperity on the occasion. Indeed, she smiled and looked much pleased as she made the observation. A smile such as she used to give her uncle when they met in the old happy \u2014 at least happier \u2014 times when they were all in all to each other \u2014 companions, fel low-students, and friends \u2014 with a touch of that finer sentiment of attraction and love always felt in the relations of the opposite sexes, even in cases of such near kinsmanship and consanguinity. Mr. Featherstone was rather taken aback by the question, at the same time that he was sur prised and moved by the return of the kindly expression to that countenance which he still, after all, perhaps, loved better than the lovely girlish visage which had caught his regards of late. In consequence he would have said some-"], [289, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 281 thing to remove what he thought must be an unpleasing reflection from the patient's mind. But he found it was not so. \" I am very glad, uncle,\" Rosanna Clanbrassey said, quite softly and pleasantly, but waving to Mrs. Ullathorn to retire, \" that there will remain some consolation with you. I am going now. I am struck with paralysis. I did not wish to alarm Mrs. Ullathorn, or to be plagued with doctors.

Not many hours remain to me ; for precisely at the minute when I quitted our house on my errand of horror a year ago I shall die this night !\" Mr. Featherstone was completely overcome by this unexpected address. \" My heart told me all along it was so !\" he exclaimed, bursting into an effusion of tears and sobs, perhaps for the first time, of a relieving character, since that disastrous night. \" It ought to break over my work, and it will \u2014 it does !

She would have destroyed me, had I not destroyed myself, in pure wantonness of talk and mischievous fri volity !\" Mr. Featherstone made this promise as well as he could speak for emotion ; and, still in credulous of the terrible fact his niece an nounced, or hoping that medical assistance might be of avail in her restoration, declared he would send for the doctor immediately, to as certain if she was in reality in so alarming a state as she declared. But Rosanna so ear-"], [293, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 285 nestly implored he would not do so, and grew so excited at the notion, that he became alarmed at the consequences in that way also ; and finally, at her earnest desire, consented at least not to send for Mr. Prendergast until the hour she had announced as her closing one should come. \"And do not let them play me any such tricks as they did poor Lord Lyttleton \u2014 the wicked Lord Lyttleton, as they called him \u2014 I once read to you about, uncle, in that old work that amused us so on ghosts and appari tions. You remember it, no doubt ; it was all of no use, you know, and was a kind of insult to the dying man !\" Mr. Featherstone yielded to this earnest en treaty; and seating himself by his unhappy niece's bed, they passed a very considerable time in the interchange of mutual confidences, and marks of the deepest restored love and af fection. Nor could Mr. Featherstone discern any reason for Rosanna's startling statement of her condition, with the exception that she certainly remained very fixed and immovable in the position in which she had commenced the interview. Nor had she once raised her arms,"], [294, "286 THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. even when, observing her becoming as it were sleepy while he talked to her, he embraced her fondly, and declared that he would sit by her until she woke again, and that she would then, no doubt, be almost well again, since she was so much herself in all other respects. \" I shall never be well again, uncle,\" she said, in reply. \" But I do feel very weary of all things \u2014 not of you. Good night ! How strange that language you took so much pains how to qualify me in, should fail me now when I most need it to express all my love and grati tude to you !

Uncle, Good Night!\" Those, I believe, w^ere the last intelligible words of the ill-fated lady. She appeared after that to fall into an easy and comfortable sleep, with her uncle's hand laid upon her own, which he had himself drawn at her request from be neath the counterpane. He did not attempt any of the foolish trickery she had denounced, with the great hall clock. Indeed, he had for-"], [295, "THREADS IN THE FLYING WOOF OF TIME. 287 gotten the circumstance she had made the rea son of her request, imputing her expectation of a release at that particular hour\u2014apprehension it could not be called \u2014 to overwrought feeling, and, perhaps, too strong a dose of her sedative, which had given her the notion that she was paralysed. The clock accordingly struck as usual \u2014 as it had struck on the night when Rosanna Clanbrassey took her perilous excursion to the \" The Moss.\" But precisely at the in stant of its first stroke the unhappy lady seemed aroused from her sleep, and to Mr. Feather stone's speechless amazement and alarm, sprang quite into the middle of the floor from the bed, and moved at a singularly soft and breathless step towards the windows of the chamber, which were strongly lighted by the moonbeams only, in order not to cause the patient any disturbance with light. He himself rose at once to advance to restrain her wandering ; but before he could reach the spot where she stood, she seemed suddenly to become powerless\u2014 to lose the use of her limbs \u2014 and sank upon the floor.

But the fact itself was all in connexion with the tragedy known with much certainty during the remainder of Madame's stay in Liverpool, which was longer than she had intended. Even the severe illness of her be loved sister at the Haugh, which followed so closely on that event as to be coincident with it, was most unjustifiably withheld from her rela tives' knowledge, resident or visiting in Liver pool, by her uncle. Had Madame been aware vol. ut. 19"], [298, "290 \"AU revoir.\" of that, nothing could have prevented the affec tionate woman from hastening to the scene of sickness and sorrow, and collecting every scrap of information to be laid hold of on the subject. Of course, Rosanna's ravings in her brain-fever would have been invaluable in this respect, and might even have served for foundation, in such clever hands, for a still darker and more terrible mystery of scandal and horror. But Mr. Fea therstone took care, as we have shown, that no one attended to his niece but himself in her communicative paroxysms. What ill-natured prating could do, had al ready been done, in the way of mischief, by Madame de la Mazurka. She had described the singular scenes with Blackmore during her recent visit, which had enabled Mr. Marrynett to make his annoying onslaught on Mr. Pen dragon. Nor had she omitted the adventure of the bottle of prussic acid. But she related this last only as an occasion to laud her own goodness and cleverness, in having purposely destroyed it before both gentlemen. For she frankly de clared \u2014 quite boasted \u2014 that such was the case. Done with the best motives, no doubt, to put"], [299, "\"au revoir.\" 291 her uncle on his guard against allowing so very favourite a niece to ruin her health by such vio lent remedies. And, with regard to Mr. Pen dragon, really if Rosanna was so ill, and subject to disorders that required such terrible counter actives, it was a great shame of her to try and saddle the \"poor old fellow\" with an invalid wife, besides the likelihood that she would transfer her own and her uncle's money \" all of a pop \" out of her proper family into a stranger's. And also the Countess, who had been a con temporary of Madame Laffarge, beneficently de clared that, badly as her uncle had behaved to her and all the family, excepting Rosanna, she did not like he should be ignorant that the said favourite niece dealt in such sudden means of getting at an inheritance ! Especially under the suspicious circumstances of Bailiff Blackmore's extraordinary position with regard to her and the property. So far the foolish woman had really very little idea or suspicion of the existence of cause for these black insinuations, but was piqued ex tremely at the Squire's visible dislike and con tempt for herself, and the exclusive hold her 19\u20142"], [300, "292 \"au revoir.\" sister appeared to have gained on his affection, and last will and testament in consequence, no doubt. But even when tbe circumstances of the bailiff's death were declared, she could not forbear displaying her skill and science in the art of malignant equivoque, by expressing her fears that by some unlucky accident or other the bailiff's laudanum (to which he was declared to have been so addicted) and her sister's prussic acid might have got changed in the bottles, coming from Birmingham, whence she knew Rosanna got her drugs, and where she might have recommended Mr. Blackmore. Chemists were sometimes very careless people, even with their deadliest mixtures, and the least confusion in labelling, in such a case, might lead to a fatal mistake. Mr. Marrynett, returning quite savagely out of temper from his discussion with Mr. Pen dragon \u2014 who, he perceived was withdrawing himself as much as he could from his clutches \u2014 lent again a most attentive ear to his sister-in law's remarkable comments. With the excep tion, indeed, that he would not admit the possi bility of a mistake in the case. \" No ! if it's"], [301, "\"au revoir.\" 293 been done, it's been done purposely. Prussic's the colour of water \u2014 laudanum's black !\" he exclaimed. \" Tell you what, Mrs. Marrynett ! I don't know but that it would be my duty to go at once before a magistrate and put people up to make inquiries. Perhaps it wouldn't be too late yet to analyze the body, and see whether the man came to his end by his own mixture, or somebody else's help, or not ! Featherstone deserves any annoyance, anyway, for his in famous behaviour to me and mine. Though I believe you consider I'm yours, and not you mine, on account of your grand family, for sooth ! How would they look with one of them figuring at a hanging-match, I wonder?\" For once the son and heir of the Marrynetts turned up trumps. \"How would your son look with an aunt that was hanged, when you have made a fine gentleman and a peer of the realm of him, as you talk about, I should like to know, Mr. Marrynett?\" his wife replied with dry hard emphasis. \" It'll put you and I on a par about that convict fellow you're always throwing in my face, to prove my daughter stole your diamond"], [302, "294 \"au revoir.\" ring, Mrs. Marrynett !\" replied Mr. Marrynett, who when he was grammatical was extra so. \" I'll never mention him again while I live if you will hold this absurd clatter about my sis ter Rosanna ! And where's the use, Marry nett? Don't you yourself say Pendragon has broken off his suit with her, and consequently there could be no motive \u2014 no possible motive \u2014 for Rosanna \u2014 to \u2014 to get rid of this bailiff fel low ? There's nothing impossible and unnatu ral you won't get to believe of us all at last !\" Mrs. Marrynett passionately rejoined, with an allusion the Countess only vaguely compre hended, in conjunction with the curious hint given her by Adelaide a short time previously. Mr. Marrynett, though both a county and a city magistrate, was no Lucius Junius Brutus, to execute impartial justice, strike as it might against his own affections or interests. Neither was there any tangible proof of unfair dealing with the bailiff to be taken up on public grounds, prompted by private hate. The jury had re turned a verdict that Abednego Blackmore died by the incautious use of laudanum. No men tion was made of prussic acid. On the whole,"], [303, "\" AU REVOIR.\" 295 Mr. Marrynett elected to take no further motion in the matter, though suspicions of a faint cha racter might linger in his mind, that exerted influence in a matter much nearer to his own business and bosom, though at a somewhat re mote period afterwards. An apprehension in this last connexion of ideas it was that figured at the conclusion of Mrs. Marrynett's appeal for forbearance, which she seldom made in so gentle and polite a way. And ideas in general were evidently running on that string, for when, in private with the Countess, Mrs. Marrynett was severely rating her upon her folly in trying to bring down their family to the level of Mr. Marrynett's in the way of disreputable dealings, that lady rather sharply rejoined, \" Well, upon my word I really do not understand you, any of you, in the least ! But as to any harm I can do you, Mrs. Marry nett ! by what you call my indiscretion, it is perfectly plain Mr. Marrynett considers the boy a good deal more his own than even yours ! And I must say he shows ten times more a father's feeling for it, than you a mother's !\" Mrs. Marrynett was much surprised at this"], [304, "296 \"AU REVOIR.\" observation, not being aware that, in the excess of her precautions against discovery of the real state of the case, Mrs. Primmer had given out that her step-daughter had reflected on the legitimacy of the son and heir solely as respected the parentage on the father's side. And by so doing certainly justified, in the eyes of all the gossips of Liverpool, the violence and rancour of hostility she had provoked against herself from Mr. Marrynett. That was a piece of malice, too, of a vulgar sort likely to take the popular ear, from a step-daughter to a step mother under the circumstances. And, strange to say, when she had ascertained the meaning the Countess affixed to her words, and had de rived from Miss Adelaide's information, the mamma remained nothing like so angry and uncomfortable as she had been made by the apparent insinuation in the first instance. \" I wonder whom I am supposed to have played the rover with, then? Dr. Primmer? I did not know of the man's existence till I went to Leamington to be confined ! And he has a wife of his own \u2014 and talks of making up a quarrel he has with her \u2014 and is, besides,"], [305, "\"AU REVOIR.\" 297 going on the Continent, to try and get a prac tice at some of the great spas frequented from England.

Only he has not money enough for a start \u2014 and wants to borrow some of Marrynett \u2014 and his mother bothers me terribly to ask for him. But if these strange reports are abcut, Marrynett might think it queer \u2014 and I don't know that I shall !\" \" I wouldn't if I were you, dear ; especially if there is the least shadow of a foundation for the remember how unaccountably jea lous Marrynett showed himself even on your very first wedding trip, and how he went on at Paris \u2014 like a regular madman !\" Madame re turned ; giving very good advice, but not imagining at the time that the matter at all concerned herself. She found, however, that it did, a little be fore her departure for town. Mrs. Marrynett took her sister aside on one occasion, and with a very natural effusion of a"], [306, "298 \"AU REVOIR.\" few tears, desired to make her her confidante in a most uncomfortable piece of business. Mar rynett really was jealous ! \u2014 jealous of that stupid handsome young doctor, and kept pester ing her about how annoyed he was with the frequency of his visits, now that all occasion for his services was over. \" And so I really do want above all things to get him out of the way \u2014 out of the country even, if I could \u2014 and that dear, kind, faithful Primmer is always beg ging and praying of me, too. And so I want to lend him three hundred pounds for an outfit abroad, which he has promised to repay almost immediately \u2014 but I don't like to ask Marrynett until he is out of the way, and he can't suspect I want it for him \u2014 and I have only about a hundred by me; and so I want you, Flippy dearest, to give me credit, on my daughter's ac count, for the first quarter, and let me keep two of the three hundred her papa has agreed to hand over to you quarterly till you get her mar ried off to some very rich, titled person, and then\u2014\" But Madame de la Mazurka did not in the least relish this proposal, and in return so"], [307, "\"AU REVOIR.\" 299 positively declared her total inability to under take such a charge without the proper funds in her hands, that Mrs. Marrynett speedily found the experiment a failure. And this from the sister who had always so despised money, and set up for rank and position only ! However, the Countess was at last prevailed upon to al low one hundred of her three hundred to stand over till the commencement of \" the season,\" when money would be required for everything. And with still greater reluctance agreed to pawn secretly in London a portion of her sister's jewels, to make up the remainder of the sum intended as a loan to Dr. Primmer. But she could not forbear a somewhat unkind allusion on the occasion, remarking, \" Who can tell what might be pretended, if I were discovered pawning your jewels for you ? Everyone in this house has heard about Elizabeth Marrynett stealing your diamond ring !\" Still, Madame de la Mazurka was too much a woman of the world not to perceive some strong necessity for the measure. Moreover, the jewels were clearly worth a great deal more than the sum required to be raised upon them,"], [308, "300 \" AU REVOIR.\" as the Countess\u2014 having had experience that way \u2014 speedily ascertained. But in truth Mrs. Marrynett had a private sum already laid by, amounting to twice the additional one she was obliged to raise in order to make up a thousand pounds. At which price \u2014 and at which price only \u2014 the doctor, conceiving himself master of the situation, through the fears of Mrs. Mar rynett and the insane devotion of his foolish and wicked mother \u2014 professed a firm purpose of relieving the former from his presence, and set ting up a flourishing practice in foreign parts, where his dear ma' \u2014 so he still called her \u2014 was to join him, and live happily for ever after. This good woman herself was by no means cognizant of a portion of her handsome son's purposes ; which was put in execution shortly after he had apparently retired from the scene of action with his plunder. Little Clanbrassey's nurse \u2014 wet-nurse as she was \u2014 suddenly took her departure from the house, unknown to everybody, bag and baggage, after a vehement crying scene, witnessed accidentally by one of the housemaids, over the baby's cradle, but without any information as to her reasons for"], [309, "\"au revoir.\" 301 the proceeding, or whither she took her de parture. Mrs. Primmer was, indeed, obliged completely to invent the explanation she gave, that the nurse and she had quarrelled terri bly over the former's neglect and laziness in feeding Master Marrynett out of a sour pap bottle, and that she had behaved with so much insolence in the course of the discussion that she was forced to the conclusion the woman was the worse for some strong drink. The just reproaches she directed against her for so en dangering \" dear baby's\" health had, no doubt, exasperated \" the creature\" into so strange a withdrawal, well knowing that such a fault would deprive her of all chance of interference to the contrary on her master's or mistress's part, to whom the precious child's preservation was a matter of so much anxiety and care. But Mrs. Primmer felt in her own heart there was no great likelihood she should be called upon to take charge of her son's household arrange ments, during his continental residence, and that a reconciliation she had been secretly working at between him and his lawful wife, as the most respectable means of taking up the"], [310, "302 \"au revoir.\" ravelled threads of his destiny, had come to nothing, and the thousand pounds were on a fair way to a similar destination. But this is a little anticipating events. It was necessary Madame the Countess should arrive first in London, and pawn her sister's jewels, and remit her the proceeds. That mother of the Marrynetts certainly, like the mother of the Gracchi, considered her child ren and her jewels identical, and confided both \u2014 that is to say, at least, the latter, and the one of the former whose beauty entitled her to be the first offered for negotiation in the great London matrimonial market \u2014 with equal un reserve to the care of another. So Adelaide accompanied her aunt as well as the jewels, which Madame de la Mazurka carried much more carefully than her sister Rosanna's physic phial, Mr. Marrynett \u2014 who, with his daughter Eugenie, escorted the Countess and her niece, and all their overflow of luggage and parcels, to the train \u2014 not having the least reason in the world afforded him for supposing that a selec tion of his choicest presents to his haughty and luxurious wife, figured among the valuables he"], [311, "\"AU revoir.\" 303 thus kindly assisted in looking after for his sister-in-law and his daughter Adelaide. Mrs. Marrynett had excused herself from going to the train also, on the plea that she felt so dreadfully weak and nervous, she should be sure to be making a fool of herself before people, if she went. And in reality I must say, to her credit, for the first time she seemed to realize the folly and improvidence of her con duct, in trusting her beautiful child to such heartless, worldly convoying as her sister's, and most severely repented of the whole enterprise, and would have withdrawn from it, had there been any possibility. But there was none, and she remained behind in her splendid house almost as gloomy and inconsolable over her faults and misfortunes, as the unhappy Rosanna herself over hers, in her first seeming recovery at Featherstone Hall. Nothing very remarkable occurred at the station \u2014 though something did \u2014 particularly if, as I believe, it was a purely accidental circum stance. Tom Souchong was on the platform with a friend of his \u2014 Captain Melton, from the barracks \u2014 and a number of dogs, and with"], [312, "304 \" AU REVOIR.\" their guns in cases with them, waiting to take the train in an opposite direction to the London one on a shooting excursion. Tom was looking very ill, swollen in the face, and feverish with recent afflictions and the riot ous dissipation in which he had endeavoured to find forgetfulness of his fair false one, and of the unfeeling letter of dismissal he had received. No steadying preparation for recognizing the Marrynett group coming on the railway platform with a couple of footmen in attendance, bearing the luggage from the stylish carriage in which Mr. Marrynett always made his appearance in public. Tom felt that all was over \u2014 the last link to hope broken \u2014 and Adelaide Marrynett about to turn her back for ever on him \u2014 on Liverpool \u2014 to become, with no further delay than was ne cessary to enable an unmarried duke to catch sight of her loveliness, a duchess ! He turned deadly pale, and quite staggered with the conviction ; until Captain Melton, in quiring what the deuce ailed him, and ascertain ing, swore by all that was funky and babyish he wouldn't stand a fellow making such a spooney"], [313, "\"au revoir.\" 305 of himself; and that he should let her see he cared no more for her than she did for him, or he would go up to her himself and ask for her smelling-bottle for him ! Then, plucking a geranium from his own coat- breast, the gallant captain stuck it in Tom's, and insisted he should march up with himself, in an unconcerned man ner, and wish the young jilt bon voyage to old Nick, if she liked it ! Tom, however, had not the pluck to under take this fierce enterprise, and so only distantly raised his hat to the Marrynett group, until his mettle was in reality roused by finding he was distinctly and markedly cut by them, one and all. His father's partner even ! \u2014 but the dis agreements between that always ill-yoked pair had of late become so frequent and heavy that they scarcely exhibited the externals of civility to each other, and an immediate decisive rupture seemed imminent to every one. It so happened, however, that at the moment, Tom's vivacious widow-friend of the The Dan sant came upon the platform unattended, and, recognizing him, instantly accosted him in the sweetest manner, and with a smile expressive of vol. in. 20"], [314, "306 \"au revoir.\" all sorts of dulcet things, while she seemed merely to request of him to be so very good as to look out for a place for her in the train. \" I am only going to Birmingham, on busi ness, Mr. Souchong,\" she said, \" for you know I am not a bad woman of business ; my late poor husband left everything in my hands to manage, and his was an immense concern. By-the-by, you are fond of horses, are you not ? and though omnibus things, I suppose, are seldom worth look ing at, I fancy we have almost three thousand in our different stables about the town. But I have been thinking of speculating a little in higher-class animals, and there is plenty of accommodation for training and everything at Westenra. At least I fancy so ; but I should so like you to come and see the place, if you would. And there's little Cecilia and Harry are too young to be at school, and will be so de lighted to see you, besides, because I told them how kind you were to their mamma at the party at Mr. Marrynett's, or I am sure I do not know how I should have got on at all. And by-the-by, is not that Mr. Marrynett standing there, and his daughter \u2014 one of his daughters \u2014 not the"], [315, "\"au revoir.\" 307 one they call so pretty, I should suppose ? \u2014 and that foreign lady who went bustling about so at the party, though I am sure I could never see what she did, after all. Nothing, I am quite certain, to promote the pleasure and convenience of the company.\" Mrs. Larkins was thoroughly well aware that they were the Marrynetts whom she supposed to be there, and knew all about them, Miss Marrynett and all, in their relations to the young fellow she was addressing. But Tom was luckily roused to self-assertion by this notice taken of him by a good-looking, lively, wealthy woman, widow as she might be, mother of five children as she might be. A woman who knew the world, and knew how to manage a large business, but who did not think him a spooney and an incapable, only worthy to be thrown aside with contempt and scorn. Refreshed by these reflections, and the visible kindness of the widow, and willing to show that he was not quite the imbecile, woe-begone Cory don of a faithless shepherdess he was supposed to be, Tom Souchong rallied his courage and resolution, and blushing scarlet all over his 20\u20142"], [316, "308 \" AU REVOIR.\" handsome face, declared nothing would give greater pleasure than to be of service on any occasion to Mrs. Larkins \u2014 to inspect her stud on her return, and consider the capabilities of Westenra for the rearing and training of a lighter class of animal of the horse kind. Especially if he might be allowed to bring his friend Captain Melton with him (and he introduced him), who was thoroughly up to everything that way, and could give a thousand times better advice in every way. Perhaps Mrs. Larkins was not anxious for this proffered addition to the company, but she smiled and bowed a courteous assent to Captain Melton's salute ; and, as the latter was a man of much good sense, and knew it was of no use cultivating the chance on his own cccount, as he had the happiness to be already a married man, he speedily made a pretext of going to see after the proper placing of his and Mr. Sou chong's dogs in a box in the train, to leave the pair alone. And now, as it wanted still some little time for the train to start, the widow proposed that they should walk up and down the platform"], [317, "\"au revoir.\" 309 until it was ready, and talk over the outlines of this new speculation of hers. And Tom Sou chong, not being much more of a fool in reality than most young men of five-and-twenty in love with a beauty and cut by her, and thoroughly understanding himself about horses, entered with much animation and satisfaction into the species of discussion invoked concerning them. And he was now listened to in a bewitchingly sub missive and looked up-to manner by an ex tremely lively, sharp-witted, nattily-figured little widow of, say at most, thirty-seven, but who didn't look thirty in her cleverly - combined ensemble of dress and manner. At the same time that there was no constraint about her \u2014 no awkwardness of expecting anything or fear ing anything \u2014 no humbug of any kind \u2014 but as \"jolly\" to talk to, and be with, as could possibly be desired. Moreover, the chit-chat and interview all taking place under the eyes of the scornful Beauty who had not thought him worthy even of a few words of dismissal, after making him believe for so long a time that he was an object of very great interest to her, who was no longer one of the \" Fortune"], [318, "310 \"au revoir.\" Marrynett Girls,\" but almost an adventuress, going on the London market to barter her beauty for wealth \u2014 Tom made it as gay and familiar to external observation as he possibly could. On her part, the expert widow, who con sidered Tom the handsomest young fellow she had spoken to for many days, and not a bit like her late spouse, who was anything but that, fell into the plan with perfect ease and address. In fact, the pair speedily attracted general notice by their hearty air of enjoyment and cordiality in each other's society, and we may be sure that Miss Adelaide Marrynett was not among the last to notice the circumstance. Her Parisian aunt was, doubtless, among the first, for she whispered to her charge, at an interval when Mr. Marrynett was away, fussing among their luggage again, \" Observe that poor Souchong cadet, for I recognise him, I think ! What forced gaiety \u2014 what a laugh full of sad ness and mockery ! My dear child, what idiots men make of themselves when they attempt to disguise a natural emotion by its contrary ! It is not alwavs that women succeed in it \u2014 but"], [319, "\"au revoir.\" 311 they seldom make such transparent failures. That young man is pretending to be perfectly happy with the woman beside him \u2014 and his heart is breaking to witness your departure \u2014 and he feels that this bell of a railway train is for him the knell of an eternal adieu !\" \" I wish you would not talk so horridly, aunt, as if we were going to be killed on the railway !\" said the young lady addressed, very pettishly, and probably not at all delighted with what she witnessed. \" I mean to come back myself, I can assure you, some day, alive and well \u2014 and, perhaps, it will all end in nothing, my going to London, and then \" \"And then \u2014 what, my dear?\" \" How terribly rude of papa not to have bowed even when Mr. Tom Souchong looked at him so hard, and lifted his hat\u2014 I couldn't of course, if nobody else did ! But how he and that nasty flighty widow with the lots of children seem to be enjoying themselves !\" the Beauty murmured on, without seeming to relish the look of things at all. \" There is the first bell, my dear child ! We shall soon be in the midst of the splendour and"], [320, "\" AU REVOIR.\" 312 enjoyments of London, and the triumphs of your beauty will easily console you for the loss of a country admirer of the sort, if even he marries the widow !\" The Beauty looked rather revived on this intimation. \" At all events, I am very glad,\" she said, with a disdainful toss of the head, \" that it isn't that stupid Aleck making an ex hibition of herself trying after Tom ! I am sure it would quite be a disgrace to women altogether, if a girl like that were to force a young man to have her, whether he would or not. It's differ ent, of course, with a widow, though I am sure it is perfectly disgusting to see how this one is going in at Tom Souchong, before every body.\" Miss Adelaide and her aunt were now obliged to get into their carriage, Mr. Marrynett being, in fact, uncomfortably impatient to get them off, that he might run upon 'Change, and hear the news, and resume his toils and intrigues to make his Son and Heir all that he had himself failed to be in rising to honours and dignities. He crammed them in, and shaking hands with both, waited still more weariedly by the door for the"], [321, "\"au revoir.\" 313 train to start, jabbered at incessantly by Madame de la Mazurka, who remembered all at once a dozen things she had forgotten, and desired to have sent after her. But now it so happened that being so much engaged in their talk, Tom Souchong's widow found all the first-class car riages in the train occupied, when the lady play fully remarked that she really must not delay any longer for the dearest friend she had in the world. All but a single place in the carriage in which the Countess and her niece were already stowed, and settling themselves in the midst of their shawls and smaller parcels, whose name was Legion. Tom ascertained this fact in a rapid run up and down the line, and brief colloquy with the guard, who was slamming the doors to; and consequently was obliged \u2014 with a rather deadly sinking of the heart \u2014 to speak directly to Mr. Marrynett \u2014 whose hand was on the door-handle \u2014 and request leave to let in Mrs. Larkins, for Birmingham. \" This is a London carriage, sir,\" returned Mr. Marrynett, as cold and distant as if he had never seen the young man before."], [322, "314 \"au revoir.\" \" Lady must go on by it to Birmingham \u2014 no room elsewhere,\" said the guard ; and re moving his hand, Mr. Marrynett called out to his daughter, \" B'ye, b'ye, Ada ! Ajoo, Madame la Comtesse !\" in a Frenchified tone, to attract admiration, and retired disdainfully altogether from the station. To avoid any pretext of friendly intercourse, Tom thought, till looking into the carriage he perceived Ringold Segrave occupied one of the seats \u2014 doubtless going to London on business connected with the famous fifty bars of gold. I do not deny that Tom was rather agitated himself in putting his widow into the railway carriage, having to brush almost close against Miss Adelaide's travelling-dress in arranging Mrs. Larkins' crinoline after her, as she made her way, affecting for the first time to notice Miss Marrynett, to a farther seat Luckily she was not to sit quite opposite that pouting and insulted-looking young lady. But the circum stance necessitated rather a loud exchange of farewell greetings between the sprightly widow and her attentive cavalier. \" Then I shall see you at Westenra, Mr."], [323, "\" AU REVOIR.\" 315 Souchong, immediately I return, and I shall only stay a single night in Birmingham. It is all that is necessary to transact my business ; and you really cannot oblige me more than by securing the beautiful horse of Captain Melton's you mention, and I am quite sure nobody can show it off to better advantage, if you would do me the favour to ride it at our next steeple chases.\" \" I shall be but too happy, dear Mrs. Larkins, with your colours ! You may depend upon my most exact attention to your wishes in all respects,\" the young man replied, without giv ing a single glance at his once sole cynosure. \" Now, sir \u2014 train's off!\" \" Cecilia and Harry are already fond of you, Mr. Souchong, from my report, and will be so proud to let you see their little ponies.\" \" I am very fond of children, Mrs. Larkins, myself, to begin with ; they are almost as natural and kind as \u2014 as \u2014 as \u2014 their mamma ! I am so obliged to you and your \u2014 your good opinion of me, and my judgment in \u2014 in some re spects !\" \" In all, Mr. Souchong ! Good-bye \u2014 God"], [324, "\"au revoir.\" 316 bless you !\" with extreme fervour ; not motherly, though ! And so the widow and her new admirer, as he most certainly seemed to have become at a stroke, parted, leaving Adelaide Marrynett per fectly surprised to think why it annoyed her so much to know they were so soon to meet again, and on such friendly terms of intimacy. Involuntarily the proud Beauty's eyes sought Mr. Souchong's with an undefinable expression in them of pique and re-asserted empire. But his back was turned, and he was listening to the eager, laughing congratulations of \" his friend, Captain Melton, on his conquest of the wealthiest widow in Liverpool, and of tastes and posses sions so congenial to his own. If Tom listened a little sadly, he smiled too, and never turned his head to see if the once-adored Beauty re lented by a glance. Perhaps Adelaide herself took advantage of the first tunnel to wipe something that very much resembled tears out of her beautiful eyes, and which were not drawn there by grief at parting from her friends and home. But not the less did the train speed on with its super-"], [325, "\" AU REVOIR.\" 317 natural rush, and bear her away to the scene of those expected triumphs and happiness, on its shrieking whirlwind, for whose still shadowy attainments she had thrown away the love and devotion of a sincere and manly young heart.
