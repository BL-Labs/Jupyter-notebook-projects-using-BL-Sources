The writer of it appears to have talent, and, so far as I can judge, to be well enough supplied with in formation at home, but, with respect to things locally distant, even on occasions when and where correct information is easily accessible, you no doubt have many times been entertained in remarking what mis takes men of ability are apt to slide into when theory is in question: with what readiness, in order to build up and establish a theory, the mind permits itself to be satisfied with almost any unexamined statement of things, as premises to reason from.

The following extract will show the matter I am led to speak of."], [15, "UNITED STATES. 7 \"London, 1822. \" Of all the nations in the world, America has suffered most, by the return of peace. Her com merce, her customs, and her total revenue have been diminished at certain periods since the peace, by more than one half. In the year 1815, the net pro duce of her customs exceeded thirty-six millions* of dollars. In the year 1819, the produce of the same duties was only seventeen millions, being a diminu tion of nineteen out of thirty six. Her total revenue in 1815, was, in round figures, forty-nine and a half millions of dollars. In 1819, her total revenue was not twenty-one and a half. This diminution was chiefly in her customs, which declined from the ces sation of her carrying-trade, and the resumption by foreign nations of their own commerce. \" These circumstances in her situation are of so much more importance to us, as they at once explain the cause which, in a less degree, affected ourselves, and as the operation in both countries has been, in kind, the same. As England, during the war, manu factured for the world, America in a very great de gree, was the carrier of the world: even her raw produce was raised to an immen.se price, by the de mand for it in the Continent of Europe. There was * Not war, but peace itself caused this high amount of cus toms, from a superabundant importation of goods into the United States. It took place after that a war with Great Britain had exhausted the country of British and other goods."], [16, "8 UNITED STATES. a constant exportation of her flour to England, on an average exceeding five hundred thousand barrels, and in the years 1801, 1802, 1811, it exceeded a million of barrels each. Her flour, cotton, tobacco, and whatever else she exported of raw produce, thus attained a price, exceeding in all articles, one third, and in many, double its present amount. Her freights, her shipping, her navy, \u2014 her price of land, her amount of circulating currency, her wages of la- bour, and her returns of capital; \u2014 in a word \u2014 her agriculture, her navigation, her commerce, her inter- nal industry and improvements, and whatever she possessed of rough domestic manufactures, increased in the same general rate as amongst ourselves. Under the general competition of one branch of employ ment with another, added to a universal demand for labour, and the abundance of money in paper and cash, prices rose throughout all commodities, and in every division of industry. \" The general peace overtook America in this state of things.* Her commerce immediately fell; and fell by nearly one half. Her circulating capital, her paper currency, was necessarily called in, or forced back iu the same proportion. Most of her banks, trading only on accommodation, broke up, * Not so. That state of things had ceased to exist in the United States more than seven years. In December 1807 a restrictive system commenced relative to commerce; which, variously modified, was continued down to the declaration of war against England in 1812."], [17, "UNITED STATES. 9 and by their bankruptcy, and the general alarm ex cited by it, still further reduced, or rather almost ex tinguished, their paper medium. \" Under this general state of things, prices now fell as abruptly in peace, as they had risen during the war. The cessation of a great portion of foreign de mand necessarily caused a glut of all raw produce in her markets. Prices thus fell from abundance. The withdrawing of foreign carrying-trade, and of foreign commerce in general, reduced the general income of the nation: and, as this trade had been carried on in *, a great degree by new men, and as profits, however large, had either been expended by a more profuse mode of living, or been embarked in augmenting stocks, (now violently rendered of less than half their recent value,) income was destroyed before capitals were accumulated. Prices thus fell from the second cause of the reduced general means. The diminution of the quantum of the currency of cash and paper necessarily followed, as above said, the diminution of trade. There were fewer dealings, and of course less occasion for the medium by which they were computed. There was no security in future profits, and of course no loans nor accommodation. There was no employment for capital; and of course neither the means nor the inducement to create or to con tinue it artificially; and prices thus fell from the third cause of the reduced quantity of money. \" Under this concurrence of circumstances, Ame rica has been suffering in a greater degree than our- a"], [18, "UNITED STATES. 10 selves, and affords a strong illustration of the actual causes of what we have seen amongst our own mer chants, manufacturers, and farmers. If we have suf fered indeed in a less degree from some of these causes, it is only because our state of society is more advanced, and our capitalists are less dependent on their income from year to year. The national wealth of England is composed of two descriptions, viz. ac cumulated capital, and current income. The one may suffer in the vicissitudes of commerce, trade, and the pecuniary value of produce in the markets; but the other fund is necessarily more permanent, and in a rich society, will maintain a large consump tion for many successive* years ; but in all new coun tries like America, the national wealth consists of little more than in the annual income. For the time, the withdrawing of income is, with them, reduction to poverty.\" * This is Undeniably true, provided it be supposed that those classes of persons in possession of wealth are ready to distribute it; that is to say, provided they have the disposi tion, as well as the ability, to create and give employment, at all events, to the working classes; a*od thus keep up a large consumption by means, on their part, of an increased expen diture; but otherwise, not true. It avails nothing to the artist, or the labouring man thrown out of employment, that his neighbour is rich, if he himself can be furnished with no material for his industry to work upon."], [19, "UNITED STATES. 11 Now, with all due acknowledgments to the Lon don writer for any sympathy he might intend to ex press, in considering the hardships enumerated in the case of the United States of America, I may suggest that there are some reasons to induce a belief that this country has not, as a nation, suffered in her sub stantial interests by the event he particularly speaks of having taken place at the epoch when it did take place. The event, I mean, of the \" resumption by foreign nations of their own commerce.\" The shock occasioned by it to this nation, was the more transient, and the less severe, inasmuch as the community had already undergone a sort of prepara tion, by a course of restrictions and curtailment of mercantile pursuits, ever since 1807, a period of more than seven years; during which, a very considerable portion of the capital that had been engaged in foreign commerce, passed into other channels. Besides which, the \" surrendering up to C\u00e6sar,\" being what in the nature of things must, sooner or later, take place, there are strong grounds for thinking that something propitious was in the moment which determined the event. The country, whilst in possession, availed herself of the immense advantages which that com merce presented, and the capital, created by rapid returns and general circulation, came to be prodi gious in amount, considering the few years only which that extraordinary opportunity lasted. The succes sive increments had been almost wholly directed to the same line of pursuit, which was too alluring by its"], [20, "12 UNITED ST.\\TES. immediate profits to admit of any great share of at tention being given to other objects; but, before the epoch in question had arrived, the chief part of this accumulated current capital, being released, as above stated, from that employment, had necessarily a new one to seek: and this was found in objects of the highest permanent importance to the nation. It is highly probable that no extra accumulation of floating wealth through the means of commerce exclusively, could have constituted an adequate compensation for delaying to prosecute a very pointed inquiry and deep research, such as had then commenced, into some concerns more literally at home; namely, the exploring and examining into the state of our own possessions, and ascertaining with some degree of precision, what it is that we actually have, and what, with the exertions of an intelligent industry, there may be the means of our having in time to come; and, in consequence, to enter upon such a system of internal improvements as shall ultimately bring for ward the powers of the country in production and usefulness, to the utmost point of perfection attain able. In this pursuit much capital has been engaged within the last few years, and it will more and more continue to be so. The London writer had certainly been misled by erroneous or superficial reports made relative to the slate of things in this country. They had presented to him a much too highly coloured picture of our"], [21, "UNITED STATES. 13 distresses consequent on the return of peace in the year 1815. Doubtless, the restoration of peace to Europe, by which it became necessary for the United States, at one and the same time when her own peace was made with Great Britain, to surrender up to different nations, their own respective portions of a property, which she had held as it were in trust, and, during a term of years antecedent to her difference with En gland, had enjoyed the lucrative benefits of; \u2014 doubt less, I say, this did occasion a severe, and a distress ing shock to hundreds of individuals amongst us, perhaps thousands, who had embarked their capitals and their credit in commercial enterprises, and who had their plans, and their engagements, and their mode of living; all more or less adapted to a renewal of that state of things, and to no other. But, any serious embarrassments were far from having ex istence among the people at large; and much less does the inference follow that the nation herself fell thereupon into ruinous circumstances; or, in the writer's own words, that the withdrawing of such \" current income\" produced by a foreign commerce, was, in the case of the United States, though a young country, \" reduction to poverty.\" If the said writer were to view the face, or a part of the face of this country, I do not doubt of his rea diness to admit a modification of his maxim in politi cal economy touching young countries. The prefix of pome for that of all, would probably appear to him"], [22, "UNITED STATES. 14 a proper change. He would here behold something more tangible and permanent than a mere fleeting shadow; something more real in the people's posses sion than a mere remembrance of that kind of capital which he denominates \" capital of current income,\" and which his present doctrine would persuade us, hath passed away and left no trace! He would find, whatever may be the case as to numbers of individuals, or their condition, that, with regard to the government and the nation at large, they have neither \" slumbered during the harvest,\" nor been \" improvident spendthrifts\" in the day of prosperity. At every point towards which his observation might be directed, he would see evidences of \" accu mulated capital,\" and that accumulation moreover in active and spirited operation for greater and con tinued accumulations; for the attainment of which, perhaps, also, he would perceive that there exists, in the nature and circumstances of this country, com bined with those of the times we live in, and under the blessing of Providence, such a field for successful exertion ; such a scope for the exercise of intelligent industry, as we are not presented with a parallel to, in the rising circumstances of other nations, either by contemporary observation or from the records of history. If the said writer, by his observations here on the spot, found the United States still to have the charac teristics of a youthful nation, he would also find us,"], [23, "UNITED STATES. 15 not still in a state of helpless infancy. The whole of that stage of existence has effectually passed away: but it has so passed as to be now succeeded by a youth of vigour; unimpaired, and competent, in itself, to great purposes. In a word, I am well assured the respectable writer would have it made manifest to his observation, that the United States has within herself a very large fund of accumulated wealth or capital ; \u2014 that, along with good governmental regulation for the freedom and protection of her enterprises, she pos sesses also science to direct, and industry to execute whatever is desirable in her operations to progressive wealth ; and therefore, that we do not fall within that class of young countries, which must, by the vicissi tudes of a foreign commerce happening to withdraw an annual income once enjoyed, necessarily be re-, duced to poverty. But, there is another proposition which stands op->. posed to the said writer's doctrine as to young coun tries; the evidence whereof will, I believe, be quite equal to that of the above. It is this; that in a country like the United States, fruitful beyond calculation in various raw productions, as well for manufacture as serving for sustenance; these productions having no limitation in quantity but by the quantity of land which it may please the cultivator to throw into cul tivation ; with a population extremely limited in com parison with the resources of the soil ; at the same time possessing capital sufficient to give scope to all the industry of that population, so as to developc"], [24, "UNITED STATES. 16 gradually the resources of the land, and, in bringing these into activity, to multiply periodically both na- tional capital and the quantity of raw materials, in a ratio at least equivalent to the progressive course of the population; \u2014 in such a country, I say, so cir- cumstanced, it appears extremely probable, if not amounting quite to demonstration, that any tempo- rary deprivation of an accustomed foreign commerce, or any sudden depreciation in the pecuniary value of produce in the markets, will not, either of them or both, cause so heavy or general a distress to the body of the people, as in the event of a like disappointment, or in other words, the loss of \" income\" for the time, must be felt in the older country, although this latter should be replenished and overflowing with capital, or, in other words, be \" rich,\" but at the same time, should possess a great and overflowing population compared with the internal resources of her own soil: For, in the latter case, by the very circumstance of a great population, it naturally follows that all the de partments of industry are thereby constantly supplied and kept full, or nearly so; and that therefore, in case of disappointment diminishing the proportion of de mand in any one branch, there can be but little room for the industry corresponding to it to resort to an other branch, in such a way as, that the whole mass of industry may, at all times, find employment. It seems quite clear, that the fluctuations of trade, from any sudden unfavourable revolution in things abroad, affecting any particular department of industry en-"], [25, "UNITED STATES. 17 gaged therein, will fall the heavier, inasmuch as a remedy is not so immediately within reach as it is in the former supposed case; where the mass of em- ployment bears a greater proportion to that of labour, and where new enterprise, which the circumstances of the country every day give rise to, is continually creating additions to the general mass of employment. In one case, the national industry is dependent, for full employment, partly on events abroad; whilst in the other case, the nation possesses within herself, by means of the advancing state of her improvements, resources for the full employment of her limited po- pulation. If, in consequence of the diminution, or the cessation of an accustomed foreign trade, or a fall in value of the country's productions at foreign markets, or of both together, a check be given to these particular pursuits of the capitalist, or we will say, to his pursuits generally, upon the same scale as before; if, by reason of this check, a depression even does take place in the general value of labour, it will yet be found that the fall has not been more violent or disastrous than a fall from very high to less high wages; and, under the circumstances supposed, the languor of a late active course of business can by no means reduce this value disproportionately to the ne cessaries of living, or below the rate of affording a comfortable subsistence to the aggregate industry of the country. Moreover, capital being actually in ex istence, whilst every day some new object may be presented to the attention of capitalists, for its em- S"], [26, "18 UNITED STATES. ployment, it is obvious that any sudden depression in the value of labour from high to moderate wages, arising from foreign causes, can be only of temporary duration. Wages must have a constant tendency to be on a scale considerably above procuring the bare necessaries of life, so long as the state of the popula tion bears such a relation to the internal resources of the country as, on every occasion of a fresh or sud den demand for labour, a scanty supply of it can only be had, and so long as there are capitalists who every day may chance to be tempted to bring a part of those resources into activity which previously had lain dor mant. The great law of M supply and demand\" is well enough known to operate on the price, or wages of labour, as it does on the price of every commodity whatsoever. I will endeavour, in a few words, to recapitulate, or attempt to vary the point of view, briefly as I can. As this country, by its vast extent and fertility, has, and will have for many years to come, a capability of periodical production in useful articles, great in pro portion to its population and to the quantity of in dustry this population can supply; as also, there are in the country both capital and intelligence, to ex plore and bring its resources forward; it follows that, so long as the articles produced are in demand, either for consumption at home or at markets abroad, and whether they consist almost wholly in raw produce or have in greater or less proportion undergone a pro cess of manufacture; so long will the labour of the"], [27, "UNITED STATES. 19 country at large be well paid, because generally speak ing, fully employed, and were there more of it, would still be employed: in other words, wages will continue high ; and the comforts as well as the necessaries of life be attainable to the labourer. Again, as the articles of production, besides the circumstance of their great abundance in waiting for the hand of labour, are likewise various in kind, and appertain to different climates, it also follows, that there is room for a freer resort to be had to one class in preference to another, according to fluctuations in the markets and a pre dominance of demand for one or other kind of pro duction. A partial change is perhaps made for a sea son, of more or less duration, in the direction of the country's industry and the country's capital ; but they both continue to be employed and remunerated. , And finally, as a mind of general intelligence and capacity is found to pervade the population of this country, in so much that there is manifested, in num berless instances, a remarkable^ aptitude for profi ciency in more than one department of industry by the same individual, or same set of individuals; so it follows necessarily, from all these premises together, that the labouring community can not know distress from want; that is to say, the wages of labour will continue good, and wealth be liberally distributed. Unless it so happen, that either the powers of the soil, or the faculties of its inhabitants and their pre sent habits, undergo a change; or until the period arrive, when a surcharged population shall furnish a"], [28, "UNITED STATES. 20 greater mass of industry than can be employed, in supplying all the current demand at home, and all the current demand in markets abroad collectively. Which period may indeed be very long delayed, if not put off ad infinitum,* provided our own domestic wants and refinements do but keep even pace with population; going on to increase and vary their de mands upon labour, in its numerous departments, as fast as population can supply it. In which continually growing demands, it is especially to be noted, the * It may well be understood, that no decision is here intend ed upon the abstract proposition; or the question between\" means of subsistence,\" and the \" principle of population\" extended to its ultimate effects. There is, happily, scope in this land for a very long period in prospective, during which, it is to be hoped there will exist no cause to view the continual ac cessions to population, in any other light than as propor tionate enlargements of the sphere of human enjoyment. And moreover, considering the signal happiness which has been conferred on all of us at the present epoch, whose lotos existence, it is allowed, has been cast in an age pregnant with wonderful discoveries, perhaps it may not be. thought too Utopian, \u2014 too remote from all reasonable hope, in any genuine philanthropist, if he should even permit his imagina tion to luxuriate in a belief that there are yet discoveries to be made; not only in the physical world, but also perhaps in modifications of the principle of \"moral restraint,\" or the combination of both together and their application; by which, the resources for both the subsistence and happiness ofthe hu man race, may possibly, at a future day, be increased or multiplied to a degree far beyond any calculation that could now be made, or that the generality of mankind have ever yet dreamed of."], [29, "UNITED STATES. 21 entire population enjoys a real effective concern; for, we are most happily exempt from monopolies, or as some of them have been termed, \" encouragements,\" favouring or professing to favour particular callings, or some one branch of industry; and operating to the detriment of others and ofthe community, as is found to be the case in countries where such partialities have obtained a footing. Here, all is free and open to an upright acquisition of w7ealth, as choice in the mode of pursuit may direct, and to a happy distribu tion of it when acquired. But. another combination of a few facts, may per haps form a conclusive reply to the positions regard ing these United States, laid down in the work re ferred to. I am led to state them thus: 1. It is a fact, that since the establishment of peace, (now about eight years,) which the London writer depicts as so disastrous for the United States, this country has enjoyed such prosperity, that a greater quantity of internal improvement of every de scription, particularly in giving facilities to intercom munication and trade, one district with another, has actually taken place, than could antecedently be ef fected in a much longer period of the federal govern ment, and in this same spirit the work is advancing. 2. It is a fact also, that the prosperity of the Uni ted States, since the late war ceased, and peace took place, has been so great, that government found it not needful to continue certain taxes which were then in force; and the country is accordingly now exempt from excise and every direct tax to the Fede-"], [30, "UNITED STATES. 22 rai Government: whose dependence for revenue, is solely on the customs and the sales of public lands. The wliich, as things are situated, are found ade quate to the national expenditure, including what is requisite for both the interest and the extinction gradually ofa moderate public debt. 3. It is moreover a fact, that the public revenue, from the two sources specified, is actually in a state of considerable increase; also, that industry through the country is every day taking a wider range, and a portion of the product of it as constantly converted into \" permanent capital,\" or solid national wealth. This is so conspicuously the case, as to be visible to every one of common observation, whose opportuni ties lead to a view of the passing occurrences. And therefore, 4. It appears evident, that the United States, not only did not suffer any great national distress by the return of peace in 1815, but also, that, through the opportunities peace has afforded, she is at this day ad vanced to a state of much greater affluence than she then, or ever before enjoyed; with the fairest pros pect of still advancing in national wealth, and power, and happiness, so long as the state of peace suffers no interruption, and so long, be it especially said, as the government and fundamental institutions of the na tion, which now have successfully undergone the test of experience, shall subsist in their purity and energy, and, together therewith, so long as public and pri vate good morals shall continue to be cultivated and cherished in the land."], [31, "UNITED STATES. 23 Although in the foregoing pages, I have much sur passed perhaps, what was meet to be said in the re ply I undertook, yet with your leave, I will still prose cute the interesting theme of this country, and ad vance with it a stage or two farther. The President's opening message to Congress has reached this city from Washington. You will read it in the public prints, and doubtless with interest ; and perhaps will find in it a confirmation of some of my remarks on the \" state of the nation.\" You will at the same time, I believe, discern, that along with the many warm and well applied congratulations to the country, suggested by the present situation of af fairs, there is the opposite of any tendency, to re lax in salutary vigilance and precaution. Our Go vernment has still a watchful eye, that steadily is looking forward to reverses and the worst that may happen. Critics we have, who believe they discover in the composition, that the key note is war, mili tary power, &c. &c. &c. but perhaps without the smallest just foundation; for the usual reply may be, and in point of fact is, given, that if we are enjoined to arm ourselves \" at all points,\" and keep on the alert, it is, that such a state of preparation is the most like ly preservative in favour of peace, or, at the worst, constitutes such kind of ready meaus as the nation ought to be furnished with, of asserting her rights with effect, in any emergency that may by possibility"], [32, "UNITED STATES. 24 happen. The which, as things have gone in the world, considered, you will probably say is not un wise policy. The President, too, is a friend to a vigo rous prosecution of internal improvements, although for mere commercial purposes, or indeed lor almost any purpose other than defensive, they are thought by him, not to have been brought by our constitu tional pact, within the province of the federal govern ment. Of course, you have heard much of the New York canals, a western one, length 350 miles and upwards, to connect Lake Erie at Buffalo, with the Hudson at Albany; a northern one, to connect the waters of the St. Lawrence river via Lake Champlain, with the Hudson also. The latter is finished, save a short cut hereafter to be made into the other. Governor Clinton laid the last stone at Waterford a few days ago, and witnessed the passing of boats, which had come from Lake Ontario, via the St Lawrence and Sorel rivers: the western canal is expected, from of ficial report, to be finished in 1825. The undertaking of these works in the State of New York, in 1817, although, by reason of its mag nitude, it did not at the time escape the shafts of ridi cule, had soon the effect of an extra stimulant to us at most of the leading points of the country, for simi lar undertakings; and this spirit, which now becomes every day more and more diffused, there seems good reason to believe will, before the lapse of many years, give existence to a great chain of public or private"], [33, "UNITED STATES. 25 works, (canals, roads and bridges) through the coun try; all uniting in one object; that of giving as much facility as can be devised to commercial intercourse, one district with another, of our vast regions. As a necessary consequence, there will be brought into activity the various resources of the interior, those which already are, with more or less precision, known to exist, and others (many no doubt) yet to be explored; and thus to multiply the materials for domestic exchange and use, as well as for foreign trade. Foreign trade, and home trade, will thus go on flour ishing together, and advancing towards that period, when markets are no longer to be found abroad for the increasing quantities of our exportable produc tions. To arrive speedily at which period, nothing, it is pobable, will be left unattempted, which the spirit of improvement I have just now mentioned can stir up any hopes of accomplishing; and under such an influence, nothing short of a very general circu lation of useful industry must be quickened and re ceive accelerated force ; increasing, in a proportionate degree, the national wealth and security. Considering these things, one may naturally be led to propound the question, what are the nation's ulti mate prospects? what is the state she may arrive at? 4"], [34, "UNITED STATES. 26 There is indeed some danger of a visionary temeri ty iu our anticipations, if a latitude of indulgence be allowed, in imagining what the national means here after will be capable of accomplishing within certain given periods; especially should these periods em brace any great distance of time: but, in taking a re view of the present state of America, and recurring to what America was, only a very few fears ago ; if a careful examination be made into the causes which, in so short an interval, have brought about this great difference of condition ; if also, the spirit of the times, which actuates present exertion, be duly considered; we may in this way, free from any risk of being grossly mistaken in the speculation, carry our ideas forward to a short distance, and form a conjecture of what is to happen, within at least a limited period of the future: always, however, I would still say, with a proviso, that in this operation, we do not omit to make allowances for the occurrence of political dis aster; ofthe which, although it may happen to seem most unlikely, if not impossible, that any should inter vene, of such a nature as to defeat altogether the con summation of certain national objects suggested with in our mind, yet various degrees of mischance may, now ithstanding, be continually starting up in a shape to delay the fulfilment of events, and thereby vary the real periods or stages of the nation's advancing state of prosperity, from those periods of time which calcu lation, without such allowances, would have assigned to it."], [35, "UNITED STATES. 27 But, in forming our conjectural estimate of the fu ture advancement of this country in riches and pow er, we are released, it seems, from reasoning by that course of analogy which has reference to what has happened in and to other countries. We are released, as a consequence to our very great dissimilarity of political situation, w7ithany other nation of which his tory makes any report.

We pos sess at this day, 1940 miles complete, of excellent turnpike roads, traversing the State, and having on their surface no angle greater than 5\u00b0, even where they cross the highest mountains. This includes as follows: One stone road of 300 miles, between Philadel- phia and Pittsburgh; and part of another be tween the same cities, in progress, by a dif- ferent route.

Yet, as I have heretofore shown, our views are not to be confined within even such a range of enterprise as this. I will here present you with a little specimen of New York accomptantship, in relation to new pro jects. It displays the kind of ideas that are enter tained on the subject, in that quarter; which is my reason for transcribing it, as follows:"], [78, "UNITED STATES. 70 The Erie and Champlain canals, when complete, in 1825, will have cost, at the highest estimate, Doll. 7,500.000.

So much for prospects and projects in New York. The Dismal Swamp canal, let me inform you, is situ ate between Virginia and North Carolina, connect ing the Chesapeake and Albemarle Sound, by a cut from Elizabeth river to Pasquotauk. It is in length 22\\ miles, 38 feet wide at the surface, 6 feet deep, and is calculated for Sloop-navigation, admitting vessels to pass through the locks with sixty or se venty hogsheads of tobacco, or about three hundred barrels of flour, with masts standing. To be somewhat more particular on the topic of further enterprise, I have to observe, that the public mind is turned towards a thorough inland navigable communication, between the Northern, the Southern, the Western, and the Atlantic waters of the United States; which, provided the country continues to be blessed with peace, will, in all probability, be ac- complished before the lapse of a long series of years."], [80, "UNITED STATES. 72 Several plans have been brought forward for a junction of the Mississippi with the great lakes; most of these plans proposing the river Ohio as a medium, and the canal to strike from some point of Lake Erie. Amongst the plans of a different route, one by the Chicago and Illinois rivers, has been suggested, and is represented as being comparatively of very easy execut;on. The two rivers intermingle their sources, and present one of those remarkable instances of rivers originating in a plain so nearly approaching to the curve of a sphere, as to leave for the discharge ofthe waters, scarcely a sufficient inclination to deter mine their course. I ought to have mentioned, that the Chicago is a river discharging into Lake Michi gan, near the SW. extremity. There are no inter vening mountains to obstruct canal-work, and the distance is short. The rivers themselves, said to be free from rapids and shoals, so as to supply an unim peded navigation* down to the Mississippi. In the present state however, of the country, the Ohio route is more interesting, by reason of the density of its population and actual productiveness ofthe land, than is as yet the Illinois track; but the passage of that river is interrupted, in the dry season ofthe year, at the rapids below Louisville ;f to remedy * My information concerning the Illinois route, is from Mr. Darby. t Here dwells honest Byrne."], [81, "UNITED STATES. 73 which, a lock-construction is there requisite. Upon the whole, it appears highly probable that the Ohio and Illinois rivers will eventually both become, by the aid of canals, channels of communication between the Great Lakes and the Western waters. Other im provements being also made, the several divisions of the country will hereafter have, in their commercial intercourse, a choice, both of different markets, for their commodities, and of different routes to the same market; to be availed of, the one or the other, ac cording to the season of the year and other circum stances.

Of which range, the distance to St. Louis, as above sketched, makes but a small part. How soon this may be fully realized, I do not know; but in the mean time, we shall have effected some thing in other quarters. You will readily call to mind, among the little in cidents of the tour we made together in 1808, the perusal of a eopy, just then received by a certain gentleman, of Mr. Secretary Gallatin's famous re port upon inland navigation and roads. It projected in particular, a line of canals along the Atlantic coast, from Boston harbour to Carolina; which appeared to gather friends desirous for its execution. The navigation proposed, was to be for sea-vessels, and the connexion, to be effected by four canals, as follows: 1. Boston harbour to Rhode Island. 2. Rariton river to the Delaware. 3. Peninsula between the Delaware and Chesa- peake. 4. Chesapeake to Albemarle Sound."], [83, "UNITED STATES. 75 Between Weymouth and Taunton, . . 26 Miles Brunswick and Trenton, . . 28 do.

At that time however, and for years after, the na tion was too much engaged with some other objects, to deliberate with effect upon this undertaking; and since then, when Congress took up the matter, and decided in favour of the work of internal improve ment on a general scale, it was arrested, by a negative opinion of the President, touching constitutional au thority in the Federal government to execute such works. Whether a greater latitude may hereafter be al lowed to constructive authority, so as to embrace the point, or whether an amendment to the constitution al instrument may be resorted to, so as to do away the doubt by an express autlwiity, is uncertain ; but in one ofthe two ways the difficulty will probably be gotten over; for, that it should exist at all, is by many, whose views are extensive, regretted. They per ceive a reasonable propriety in some part of the ex pected overflowings of the national treasury being ap plied to an object, than which one of greater public prospective utility could not well be devised."], [84, "76 UNITED ST.\\TES. At the very last session of Congress, a committee reported in favour of surveys being gone into, with a view to the following, as national undertakings. They proposed, 1. The line of canals along the Atlantic coast, as above described. 2. A great road from Washington city to New Or- leans. 3. Canals, to connect the waters of the Ohio river above, with those below the rapids at Louis- ville; Lake Erie with the river Ohio; the tide-waters of the Potomac at Washington, with the same river at Cumberland. 4. Canal-communication between the Susquehanna, and the rivers Seneca and Genessee. 5. Canal-communication between the Tennessee and Savannah rivers; and between the Tennessee, the Alabama and Tombecbee rivers. But, according to what is above related, all effectu al steps in this, so far as regards the general govern ment, must probably be suspended for the present, by the constitutional doubt. In the mean time, you will have seen from what I state, that, the great work is advancing by piecemeal, in different quarters:"], [85, "UNITED STATES. 77 incorporated companies, composed of individuals and their particular State governments, are zealous in it, at least in proportion to the views they each entertain of respective local advantages. On speaking of the turnpike roads in the State of Pennsylvania, I might have observed, that near the sum of seven millions of dollars has been expended in the first formation of them, besides the needful expenditure, from time to time, to keep them in re pair. I have properly characterized above, our works, now in great forwardness, on and between the rivers Schuylkill and Susquehanna; when complete, they will have most beneficial consequences. The city of Philadelphia is beginning to receive coal from some ofthe mines situate on the Schuylkill. The Delaware and Chesapeake canal, (one of Mr. Gallatin's four) was undertaken many years ago; but after a while, suspended, from temporary causes: this, it is almost certain, will be resumed forthwith, with provision made for a prompt completion of it; and the intention is, to adapt it to ship-navigation ; so that vessels from Philadelphia bound to sea, may then have a choice between the Capes of Delaware, and the Capes of Virginia, to depart from; and of course, inward vessels arriving on the coast, the same choice of Capes to enter by."], [86, "UNITED STATES. 78 The Dismal Swamp Canal, between Virginia and North Carolina, is another of Mr. Gallatin's four; and it is quite probable, as before stated, that a third one ofthe four will soon be undertaken, viz. the cut across New Jersey; if which should be made a ship-pas- sage, as is likewise probable, then may large vessels navigate within land, from the Capes of Virginia quite to Rhode Island, and vice versa; and besides, may proceed up the Hudson river, to within a very few miles of Albany; where, if a short lock-im- provement be made, to overcome an impediment yet existing, then may ships come in contact with the Erie, and the Champlain canals, and have the benefit of an inland navigation, from the very point of union at Albany, to the Capes of Virginia, or of Delaware, at pleasure, as also between Albany and Rhode Is land. This is no inconsiderable range within land, for vessels of burthen, either equipped for sea, or not, as the case may happen and objects require. Amongst other matters under consideration, for accomplishment by individual means and State go vernment aid, a prominent one is to improve the navigation of the Potomac, by a lock-construction and series of works, between tide-water at Washing ton, and Cumberland on the same river, and thence to the waters of the Ohio, to form a junction with that river; a distance in all, of perhaps three hun dred and fifty miles. The State of Virginia has actually passed a law to subscribe one million of"], [87, "UNITED STATES. 79 dollars, or 2-5ths of a stock of 2\\ millions to be created for that purpose, as soon as the other 3-5ths or 1,500,000 dollars shall be elsewhere subscribed. That state has, I believe, a standing law, whereby a Board of commissioners are empowered to sub scribe, on behalf of the state, 2-5ths toward any works of approved general utility within the State, conditionally that the other 3-5ths are subscribed and partly paid in. The Maryland legislature has passed resolutions, directing a survey to determine as to the practica bility of a canal from Baltimore to the river Potomac, and of another from Baltimore to the Susquehanna near Conawago falls. In South Carolina, some of the rivers are already connected by valuable canal-works. In Massachusetts, the Middlesex canal, connect ing Boston harbour and the river Merrimack, is a fine substantial work, and highly useful; and, what most probably will become of great general utility, though not as yet productive to the incorporated pro prietors, is a work situate behind the town of Boston, now quite or nearly completed, at the expense of near a million ; for the purpose of furnishing water power. This is effected by means of two dams, which admit and confine the tide: one of them mak-"], [88, "80 UNITED STATES. ing a chord line, to a basin approaching to the cir cular form ; the other dam, which is perpendicular to the chord, and about one mile in length, being al lotted for the erection of mills and factories."], [89, "UNITED STATES 81 I have now brought forward sundry facts and obser vations agreeably to intimation; and, with the excep tion of one topic, comprising all that I had in my mind in relation to the subject before us: 1. I have delineated, in the form of a comparative table, the prominent features of American opu- lence in the year 1822, with reference to the year 1792. 2. I have, for reasons given, assigned as the proxi- mate cause of most of this accumulated wealth of the country, the commercial opportunities thrown in her way by the convulsions of Europe: I say proximate, meaning that this cause, or oc- casion, is not to be considered as alone and un- connected, but to be taken in combination with the previously formed industrious habits of a peo- ple, with their mental intelligence, and with a particular aptitude and skill which they possess, in the pursuit of commerce; whereby, the occa- sion being presented, there was found little tardi- ness to profit by it, and as little mistake in the II"], [90, "UNITED STATES 82 mode; and above all, taken in combination with the circumstance of our country's teeming with productions, \u2014 ships and able seamen included in the number, \u2014 such as happened at that period to be precisely those things, of which Europe felt the most pressing want. All this understood, I have not hesitated to deduce the present national opulence, as an immediate effect of extraordinary opportunities of foreign commerce, enjoyed dur ing some years; and I have hazarded some con jectures, or at the least, have sketched an outline for conjectures, upon the operation of existing causes for its further advancement. 3. I have endeavoured to place in view, a few of the leading improvements on the face ofthe country, actually finished or in progress of execution, with others projected; especially as relating to facilities of commercial intercourse, bringing the remote parts of this extensive country into close intimacy, and consequent thereupon, tending most effectually to explore her latent sources of treasure in every direction; by which, to increase the mass as well as the number or variety of her productions, and bring the whole of these into rapid circulation. 4. I have endeavoured, by stating a few collateral circumstances, to convey an idea of the active spirit and intelligent power, with which these im-"], [91, "UNITED STATES. 83 provements, and of course the several appropriate industrious pursuits, are carried on and extended, in the road to further, and perhaps accelerated, accumulations of wealth and power. 5. I have endeavoured through the whole, directly or indirectly, to point also to American mind \u2014 its original capability and its opportunities of expan- sion \u2014 as being in itself thegreat spring, or fountain head, of all the rest. The anticipations we are wont to indulge in, have their rise, their origin and support, in what is observable in the state and character of that mind ; or the tendency which we believe we discover in it, to support from choice, and render permanent, the essential insti- tutions of the country. With the use then, of whatever these materials may be found to add to your own previous stock and stores, should you be induced to speculate deeply, and of course with that warmth of interest, which I may well suppose you have not ceased to feel in the destinies of this land of promise, there are few things in the world could afford me a higher gratification than to be favoured with the results of your speculations, ge neral and particular; not any thing perhaps remain ing in the world, which could equal towards me the gratification I should have in the opportunity of con ferring with you upon them, and some other subjects, here on the spot."], [92, "84 UNITED ST.VTES. But, I have hinted just above, at some reserve in respect to a certain topic. It is a point, I will ven ture to say, not yielding in importance to any other in my catalogue of premises; and yet, I believe that, without violence to custom in speculations of the na ture before us, it might be cast into exclusion; or at the least, might not be allowed to occupy the visible place for consideration, which it certainly merits. I have, it is true, hesitated at bringing it conspicuously forward, knowing that it could not escape having a place in your consideration; but 1 fiually concluded the better way to be, to lay all open, and not wilfully to abstain from any matter-of-fact suggestion or re mark, that might, by possibility, aid in awakening your reflections on the subject, or widen the field of view. There is need of my craving your indulgence for so immoderate an introduction. Perhaps by this time you perceive that what I allude to, bears relation to the religious and moral character of the nation; \u2014 the influence that this may have, according as it shall, or shall not, be established and maintained consistently throughout; the influence, I say, favourable or unfa vourable, that this may have, over the stability of this country's present happy institutions? My pen here approaches to the fearful word Slavery. Opinions with us are, I believe you know, at vari ance, as to the remote effects to be expected from this"], [93, "UNITED STATES. 85 evil ; though it is nothing more than justice to say, that many of those, if not nearly all, the most inte rested in this species of property, do unite in ac knowledging the thing to be as I here name it. The difficulty in the way of discovering a remedy, you are well enough aware of. There are those amongst us, whose exalted religious and humane feelings prompt them to look upon it as a most direful malady in the body of the state; and they behold, with all the sorrow which an unquestionably ardent love for their country can excite, the extension of it into new members. If pressed on the topic, but not otherwise, they go tbe length of saying, that although there should be a multiplicity of the best effects flowing from wise institutions, virtuous motives, zealous exe cution, and successful application of talents; \u2014 all this together, whilst it still shall constitute no more than a preponderance of good, over an inherent mass of evil in the land, may not, they apprehend, if the latter be suffered to go on growing more and more into strength, be sufficient to protect the nation, at some period, sooner or later, from a great, and perhaps deadly catastrophe! For my own humble part, I do not undertake to pronounce upon these forebodings. As to the force, or to the extent of such commotions, decay, or disruption, as this growing malady, if it can not be eradicated, may eventually stir up in the body politic, I do not allow myself, at this early and elastic stage of our political existence, to form a conjecture. It is one of those unhappy national predicaments,"], [94, "86 UNITED STATES. which, although brought into being by man, through inadvertency or the depravity of a past age, is yet what man's experience and foresight together can by no means compass all the consequences of; and very probably what the mind of man is not competent to construct any connected, feasible, philantrophic plan for the removal of; and little more perhaps is in his power than to cherish a hearty desire, and keep hope alive within his breast, trusting chiefly to some provi- dential discovery, hereafter, of means, which at pre- sent do not appear. We have witnessed in this our time, very unexpected and extraordinary events, com- pared with the very trifling and insignificant begin- nings or causes, which, to our perceptions, have brought them ultimately to pass. We have seen the rise and progress of the now numerous and various benevo- lent associations, such as School, Missionary, Bible- Societies, and the like, which both in this and other countries, are every day spreading their influence; and can it be too much to indulge a hope, that these, or some of these may, by and by, or in the end, aided with a full light of experience, and perhaps, some systematic union in their operations, be endowed with a power which shall happily reach some of the moral evils attendant hitherto on human society, that hitherto we have been rather too much in the habit of supposing there could be no remedy for?

The fruit that is to be expected in due season, from a moral, a religious, and a literary culture of the mind, extended to all subjects, the first two without limitation, the last in degree and circumstance; has quite a foremost place in the contemplations of our eminent characters of this day; and accordingly there is a redoubled attention directed to education, in fa vour of the generation growing up; as well in the more recently settled parts of the country, as those of older dtate. In all the States, and especially our cities, provision, more or less, is made for gratuitous instruc tion. A spectacle, in May last, of the sixth anniver sary procession and examination of the \" Sunday School Union\" in tbe city of New York, excited strong emotions in those who beheld it. It consisted of two thousand five hundred children, belonging to forty-eight different schools; and the number is said to have since increased: it increases in fact along with the popula tion. In the state of Pennsylvania, education is, so far as legislative provision for the object goes, laid open to all. The State is laid out in districts, and public schools are established therein, for the benefit"], [96, "88 UNITED STATES. of all indigent children. Without counting private charity-schools, which in Philadelphia are numerous, there are now in this one district, comprising the city and county of Philadelphia, about five thousand pupils taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, at the charge of the commonwealth. They are distributed, for the greater part, through seminaries erected by the commonwealth on the Lancasterian plan of instruc tion ; the rest at common schools in some of the coun ty-sections of the district. As a single specimen of the earnestness and philo sophical intelligence, as well as practical minuteness, with which, in pursuit of the main object, these ele mentary matters are handled in this u young country,\" I might here present you with a constitution and set of rules, drawn up for the government of a k' Chil dren's Asylum,\" a private charity which now makes one of the local embellishments of this city, in the vicinity ofthe Schuylkill; but the instrument is too long for a transcript, and you will excuse it.

There are several hundred at the theological semi naries; at least one thousand students of law. The profound studies, and strictly classical learn ing connected with the dead languages, are as yet. but very partially introduced; neverfhefess it is fair and natural to believe that these also wilr have their day of celebrity with us, without at all abating the ardour which now prevails for the improvements of the age in natural science, and politics. Doubtless, they are powers that will coalesce in attractive influence, and have votaries in common. The tree, in our soil, retains its vitality thoughout, although some of the branches are, as yet, not in so vigorous a state of growth as some others. There is in the American character too much inquisitiveness, and in the Ame rican intellect too much capacity, to allow it supposa- 12"], [98, "UNITED STATES. 90 ble that that variety to be enjoyed, and that compre hensiveness of thought to be attained, by partly em ploying the mental faculties in the cultivation of Greek and Latin literature; in metaphysical as well as in physical and political science; \u2014 to allow it, I say, sup posable that these studies will not be indulged in to the full. In favor of education and of general knowledge, I may likewise state, that within the last few years, public libraries and private collections of books with in the United States have vastly* increased, both in number and magnitude. With regard to the constant publication and distri bution of books, and particularly of pamphlets and papers, which are incessantly circulating informa tion, we find, in a discourse lately delivered* before the American Pljjlosophical Society in Philadelphia, a passage as foUaws: \" The publication of books is so much cheaper in this country than in Great Britain, that nearly all we use are American editions. According to reports from the Custom House made under a resolution of the Senate in 1822, it appears that the importation of books bears an extremely small proportion to the American editions. The imported books are the mere seed. It is estimated that between two and three millions of dollars worth of books are annually * By C. J. Ing-ersoll, Esq. in October, 1823."], [99, "UNITED STATES. 91 published in the United States. There have been eight editions, comprising seven thousand five-hundred copies, of D. Stewart's Philosophy published here since its appearance in Europe thirty years ago. Five hundred thousand dollars, was the capital invested m one edition of Rees' Cyclopedia. Of a lighter kind of reading, nearly two-hundred thousand copies ofthe Waverley novels, comprising five-hundred thousand volumes, have issued from the American press in the last nine years. Four thousand copies of a late Ame rican Novel were disposed of immediately on its pub lication. Five hundred dollars w7as paid by an enter prising bookseller for a single copy of one of these novels, without any copy-right, merely by prompt re publication to gratify the eagerness to read it. Among the curiosities of American literature, 1 must mention the itenerant book-trade. There are, I understand, more than two hundred wagons which travel through the United States, loaden with books for sale. Many biographical accounts of distinguished Americans are thus distributed. Fifty thousand copies of Mr. Weemys' \" Life of Washington\" have been publish ed, and mostly circulated in this way thoughout the interior. I might add to these instances, but it is un necessary. Education, the sciences, the learned pro fessions, the church, politics, together with ephemeral and fanciful productions, maintain the press in re spectable activity. \" The modern manuals of literature and science, Magazines, Journals, and Reviews, abound in the"], [100, "92 UNITED STa\\TES.

The North .\\meriCan Review, of which about four thou sand copies are circulated, is not surpassed in know ledge or learning, is not equalled in liberal and judi cious criticism, by its great British models, the Edin burgh and Quarterly Reviews, of which about four thousand copies are also published in the United Slates. Written in a pure old English style, and. for the most part, a sine American spirit, the North American Review superintends with ability the litera ture and science of America. <{ Not less than one thousand News-papers, some of them with several thousand subscribers, are circulated in this country , the daily fare of nearly every meal, iu almost every family; so cheap and common, that, like air and water, its uses are undervalued. But a free press is the great distinction of this age and country, and as indispensable as those elements to the welfare of all free countries. Abundant and emulous accounts of remarkable occurrences concentrate and diffuse information, stimulate inquiry, dispel prejudices and multiply enjoyments. Copious advertisements quick en commerce ; rapid and pervading publicity is a cheap police. An American would forego the charms of France or Italy for the luxury of a large News-paper, which makes every post an epoch, and provides the barrenest corner of existence with an universal suc cedaueum.

Nor is our experience of the licen tiousness of the press, too dear a price to pay for its freedom.\" We have, foo our popular prelections on a variety of subjects; and they are likely to be still more abundant. As many of the courses are conducted by gentlemen of abilities, there can be no doubt of much useful knowledge, as well as pleasure, being derived to the public, from this fashionable resort for instruc tion. Amongst associations, next after those for the spe cial promotion of religion and morality, the foremost rank in promising usefulness must be assigned to our agricultural societies: they are extending, and are so connfcted, that a well organized correspondence is carried on, both one with another in different parts of the country, and with societies and individuals abroad. They give occasion to fairs, which now are held in sundry places, for the exhibition and sale of the best breeds of neat cattle, sheep, and horses, im plements of husbandry, seeds, and various domestic manufactures; and premiums are usually, at these periods of meeting and shew, awarded. Associations, besides, in various departments of pursuit, in every town and district, are increasing in number; all tending to encourage and advance, one"], [102, "UNITED STATES. 94 useful art or another, or promoting discoveries as applicable to the existing and growing occasions of the country; and in general pursuing the twofold ob ject, of collecting and scattering knowledge. \" Knowledge is power,\" says the text of the day. It heads a discourse to at least one of our literary societies, in the South. Together with power, let us devoutly trust, and assure ourselves that, taken in a genuine sense, both the pursuit and the acquisition will, nay must, be happiness, seeing that, in relation to our national career, it may be said, the knowledge we aspire after is, how to curb and finally to expel the evil, which has been unguardedly suffered to gain a footing in this our world ; and how best to cherish and promote the growth of good; \u2014 the good which, notwithstanding, we have providentially been per mitted thus far to become possessed of, in no parsi monious degree; not physical alone, but, be it said with due acknowledgments, moral also. And, reverting for a moment to public schools and primary instruction, \u2014 I would observe, that our comp trollers of these schools, and especially I speak of this one of the Pennsylvania districts, are of that descrip tion of persons who, taking a comprehensive survey ofthe subject, feel a conviction that ignorance, or ob scurity of intellect prevailing among any of the or ders of a community, Bot excepting the very lowest, is the great strength and stay of vice and depravity,"], [103, "UNITED STATES. 95 liberal information a necessary ground-work for in centives to virtue ; and believe that, of all the preser vative measures which society may adopt against the spread of vice, and in favour of the security and du rability of the social establishments, no one can be so efficacious as that of universal education to a cer tain extent; they believe that in general, the several duties will be best performed, where best understood; where the understanding is most enlightened upon the true nature and tendency of them. Accordingly, actu ated by this principle, their endeavours are not spared to induce parents and guardians of poor children, in all cases, to cause the proffered benefit to be availed of: and a course of instruction in useful elementary learning, with observances pointing directly to a fu ture moral conduct, is ready to be imparted gratis, to every indigent child, of both sexes, without distinction of colour. A fact, which I feel more than an ordinary degree of satisfaction in here taking notice of is, that in the city of Philadelphia, there has been instituted, by a colour ed man of abilities, a society called \" The African Literary Society,\" whose exercises consist in essay writing and debating, and the Society is composed of thirty or forty members. They do not, it is true as yet, publish their transactions ; nor do they, I am so inform ed, admit strangers to their debates. The name of the person alluded to, is Russell Parrott; and he is said to be preparing for the gospel ministry.* *He is since dead."], [104, "UNITED STATES. 96 You have now the subject fully and clearly before you; that is to say, fully as the same was within my own comprehension, and clearly as my mediocre quali fications have enabled me to spread it for your con templation. There is no danger of your mistaking some pas sages of what is written, lor attempts at disquisition in the science of political economy. The occasioii called not for it, had even my pen been qualified, With the exception of one evil, which indeed must be acknowledged to be burthensome, and to merit the most serious and persevering thoughts towards a discovery of proper means to counteract its tenden cies, the circumstances of this country are happily such as not yet to call for the absolute determination of the seemingly intricate points which in some other countries have, of late years, occupied the pens of so many eminent writers on that science, and still oc cupy them n.iost laudably. The modes oi producing wealth in the nation, as things are at present here con stituted, it would seem, are pretty thoroughly under-"], [105, "UNITED STATES. 97 stood, and the distribution also has the appearance of going on, pretty nearly as might be wished. I mean by this, no more than to observe, that in the actual situation of the country, wealth does, by a na tural and easy circulation, cheer and invigorate the system through all its ramifications of industry. It flows, as it were by a natural impulse, along and through the various channels thereof, apparently without obstruction or irregularity that hath need of any artificial interference. Nevertheless, be it re membered, that now is the nation's happy adolescence ; and, although at present, so singularly happy as to have her tide of prosperity distributed with pure equality, and seemingly without an exertion; yet time must necessarily bring its changes, and one-day the powerful competition alone of a vast population, may without other causes, possibly require all the ingenuity and energy ofthe statesman; all the philanthropy and disinterestedness of the patriot, with the aid, more and more, of positive institutions or enactments, to maintain and perpetuate so even a balance as that which now prevails, or the same clear and open avenues to wealth, and the happiness that wealth confers, throughout the community. And an unre mitted study, therefore, ofthe principles of political economy, it is evidently of very high importance to us, should be followed up, and this noble science be examined and sifte I to the very bottom. An ac curate investigation into the principles of it, as they are to be traced and tested by continual observation 13"], [106, "UNITED STATES. 98 upon the circumstances of other nations, may fur nish the most valuable conclusions, and these be to us, if we sedulously store them up, a real depot of wis dom, against the day that shall call for its salutary exercise. What I have attempted is, too, for the best of rea sons, still more remote from any attempt at analysis of government, or discussion of the particular merits, the particular defects, or excellencies of either ol the three branches of our national administration, or their relationship one to another and to the whole. Disquisitions on these high points, and suggestions of modes for amending, improving, qualifying, and best adapting to a permanent end, must come from other quarters. Content am I with being one in the multi tude of recipients and no more, for such portion of this kind of knowledge as opportunities happen to afford, coming, in the shape of judicious remarks, from the statesman the professional character or the man of genius. In the review I have taken, my busi ness has rather been with the physical, moral, and in tellectual capabilities of this great country, and with our national institutions taken in the aggregate; as suming for truth, the general excellence ofthe latter, in virtue of the experience had, down to the present day, of their effects; also the probable stability ofthe same as to essential outline and feature, in virtue of a matter-of-fact or two, which, relative to that topic, I have stated. And, in thus treating the great sub-"], [107, "UNITED , STATES. 99 ject, I have exerted my puisne strength in attempt ing to raise and cast aside a corner of the veil, which would seem as shrouding a MAGNIFICENT FU TURE. If then, niy willing labours, in collecting and intro- ducing a few plain facts, and the plainest inferences I could draw from them, subject to correction and es- pecially to extension, do but succeed in exciting those to whom the talent is given, to display, at proper time and qccasion, a perspective more distinct of 6cenes behind the veil; or, if these humble labours, though mere pioneer-duty, should yet be found to have sufficiently laid open and cleared a path for some respectable force to occupy the ground, and support the cause of truth and wisdom, with efficacy, at any of the points that may require it; \u2014 they v.ill have fulfilled the appointed part, and will have their reward. And here, it might perhaps be highly pro- per that I should conclude, but a few additional thoughts are presenting themselves, and some others may yet rise up; with which, counting on your acqui- escence, and time and occasion favouring me, I will still continue the subject; and, though it be in a desul- tory way, carry it on somewhat farther; stating now and then a fact or two, amending or explaining where I may, for the sake of accuracy, or of not being mis- understood.

The prediction was received al the moment as in credible; but it was so received and treated, by those not thoroughly familiar with the enterprising spirit of our back-country citizens. Already, it has been in some degree, or so far as relates to the two branches of the three spoken of, fulfilled. An active trade of exchange now subsists between the people of the Missouri, and various tribes of Indians, quite to the Stony Mountains, otherwise named Chippewan Mountains; and in the course of last year, ; 822, several expeditions of great er or less amount, we are informed, were fitted out, and passed to and from New Mexico.

This, it is reported, actually took place,* and, it is added, to the no small wonder ofthe Spaniards. With regard to East India and China commerce in that direction, it may in lime, come also into existence; but as yet, the impediments are not sufficiently known or estimated, to render it supposable they can very soon, or easily be surmounted ; and besides, as a direct trade with the \" East,\" must in that quarter become every day an object of less value comparatively, by means of the improving facilities of intercourse through our country, to and from this border, so the period for that direct trade taking place, may yet per haps be distant, and depend much on the previous settlement of a part of our regions towards the Pa cific In the mean time, we confidently trust, that no inconsiderable quantities both of the silver and the furs spoken of, will successively find their way to its, and all the commodities desired in return, including those of the \" East,\" be despatched by us from hence, and be conveniently transported to their respective places of consumption, however great the distance.

At the present mo ment, the Russians appear to have raised up claims a little adverse, along the North West coast, but these, I presume, will vanish. Forts will probably be erected up the Missouri, as high as the Yellow Stone river, as soon as the Indians will permit, and the fur trade be prosecuted largely. I cannot cloak the fact, that there exists but too much danger, our people will not content themselves with a fair and an honourable exchange of commodi ties with the Indians. Cupidity and violence are quite likely to despoil these poor aborigines, (\"rem nants ofa noble race of men) to the uttermost of their only means of subsistence, which is the produce of the chase, and that too so prematurely, as not to al low time for a sufficient attempt to be made, to bring them forward to a state of civilization, and give them, by way of some indemnity, another mode to exist by, in the cultivation of the earth. Iu short, \" hunting and trapping\" expeditions, are actually planning by companies of individuals in Missouri, and are, it is said, contemplated to extend over the whole range of country.

There is combined, a set of water-works, on a large scale; and these, for the use of the city, have been in motion since July last, (1822.) The river is dam med across at twelve hundred feel width, and its whole contents of water brought under control, amounting by computation, at the common state of the stream, to four hundred and twenty millions of gallons every twenty-four hours. These works, con sequently, include a water-power, that may be ap plied to manufacturing purposes, almost without limit-"], [123, "UNITED STATES. 115 ation, besides supplying the city to any extent requi site: for the present, they are adapted to the move ment of eight wheels, capable together, of raising ten millions gallons of water into the basins every twenty-four hours, but as yet, only two (or three) of these wheels are in motion, they giving a sufficient supply. I have touched above, upon the spread of religious societies. To give a general idea as to the effects that are taking place, from the present active condi tion of religion with us, I state, that according to com putation, there are not less than eight thousand places of worship; an equal, or greater number of ecclesi astics or preachers, in the United States; besides twelve theological seminaries, and many religious houses, containing, the former about five hundred, the latter, three hundred votaries; all which must, with us, you well know, be self-created, and depend for support upon voluntary contributions.

As we"], [126, "118 UNITED STATES. have no export duties, so a strict evaluation of eve ry item, entered -outwardly at the custom-house, has not always been observed; and a variety of articles are also constantly going out ofthe country, without reaching the custom-house record at all, but with all the effect of an export, which is, by bringing wealth back into it. This matter is likely now to be more minutely attended to, for the sake of possessing our selves of full, and circumstantial information, on a subject that has important bearings. Much error has heretofore prevailed, both in this and other countries, with regard to the balance-os trade doctrine, or at least, in the application of it to particular cases. In fact, the error I allude to, has arisen, as I believe, out of mis-statement. No coun try can, for many successive years, import to a greater amount of commodities, than she has the means of paying, and actually does pay for, in some shape or other, by her exports. And very often has it happened, that, what has been termed, and recorded as a balance of trade against the nation, from a seeming excess of imports over exports, has in truth, been so much profd, made by the nation, on those exports."], [127, "UNITED STATES. 119 I will endeavour to improve a little, upon the de scription above, of our grand water-works; and give you, in a small compass, their present state.

All which evinces, that during fourteen or fifteen of the early years of the series under consideration, a foundation was laid, by a very extraordinary influx .of wealth, for a state of things within the country, which was afterwards to shew itself more distinctly than at first; that is to say, in an accelerated advance of the nation's prosperity, at a season when, by some thoughtful and able calculators, a much slower pro gress than before was rather to be expected : \u2014 a season when the political situation ofthe world had changed, and no longer permitted us, on the occasion of our resuming an intercourse with foreign nations, those exclusive advantages which we had before enjoyed.

Second, that means are now found, \u2014 found in the increased produce of industry through the coun- try, by the application of increased capital, to enable government, at this season of altered cir- cumstances, to face a much greater annual ex- penditure than before. For, in relation to expenditure, apart from any consideration of the existing public debt, which it may, or may not, be thought advisable to extinguish, or to suddenly reduce, by any operation of a sinking fund; \u2014 apart, I say, from this, a considerable in crease has taken and is taking place, in the requisites to the several great establishments or departments of State; which the advancement of the times has called for.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives \u2014 The view which I have now to present to you of our affairs, foreign and domestic, realizes the most san guine anticipations which have been entertained, of the public prosperity. If we look to the whole, our growth, as a nation, continues to be rapid beyond ex ample, if to the States, which compose it, the same gratifying spectacle is exhibited. Our expansion over the vast territory within our limits, has been great, wtthout indicating anv decline in those sections from which the emigration has been most conspicuous. We have daily gained strength, by a native population, in every quarter: a population devoted to our happy system of government, and cherishing the bond of union with fraternal affection. Experience has al ready shown, that the difference of climate, and of in dustry proceeding from that cause, inseparable from"], [182, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 172 such vast domains, and which, under other systems, might have a repulsive tendency, cannot fail to pro duce with us, under wise regulations, the opposite ef fect.

Our relations with foreign powers, are of a friendly character, although certain interesting differences re main unsettled with some.

Our fortifications are advancing, in the de gree authorized by existing appropriations, to maturi ty; and due progress is ma 'e in the augmentation of the Navy, to tlie limit prescribed for it by law.

It has been the invariable ob ject of this government, to cherish the most friendly relations with every power, and on principles and conditions which might make them permanent. A systematic effort has been made to place our com merce, with each power, on a sooting of perfect reci procity; to settle with each, in a spirit of candour and liberality, all existing differences; and to antici pate and remove, so far as it might be practicable, all causes of future variance.

At the time when that Conven- tion wa4- concluded, many interesting subjects were unsettled, and particularly our claims to indemnity for spoliations which were committed on our com- merce in the late wars. For these interests and claims, it was in the contemplation of the parties,* to make provision at a subsequent day. by a more comprehend sive and definitive treatv. The object has been duly attended to since, by the Executive, but as yet it has not been accomplished It is hoped that a favourable opportunity will present itself lor opening a negotia- tion which may embrace and arrange all existing dif- ferences, and every other Concern iu which they have a common interest, upon the accession of the present King of France, an event which has occur red since the close of the last session of Congress. With Great Britain, our commercial intercourse rests on the same foo ing that it did last session. By the convention of 1815. the commerce between the United States and the British dominions, in Europe, and the East Indies was arranged on a principle of reciprocity. That convention was confirmed and continued in force, with slight exceptions, by a sub sequent treaty, for the term of ten years, from the 20th of October. 1818, the.date of the latter.. The trade with the British colonies in the West Indies, has not, as yet, been arranged by treaty, or other-"], [185, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 175 wise to our satisfaction. An approach to that result has been made by legislative acts, whereby many se rious impediments which had been raised by the par ties, in defence of. their respective claims, were re moved. An earnest desire exists, and has been mani fested, on the part of this government, to place the commerce with the colonies, likewise, on a footing of reciprocal advantage, and it is hoped that the British government, seeing the justice of the pro posal, and its importance to the colonies, will, ere long, accede to it. The Commissioners who were appointed for the adjustment , of the boundary, between the territories ofthe United States and those of Great Britain, spe cified in the fifth article ofthe Treaty of Gheut, hav ing disagreed in their decision; and both governments having agreed to establish that boundary, by amicable negotiation between them, it is hoped that it may be satisfactorily adjusted in that mode. The boundary specified by the sixth article, has been established, by the decision of the commissioners. From the pro gress made in that provided for by the seventh, accord* ing to a report recently received, there is good cause to presume that will be settled in the course of the ensuing year. It isa cause of serious regret, that no arrangement has yet been finally concluded between the two gov ernments, to secure, by joint co-operation, the sup pression of the slave trade. It was the object of the"], [186, "176 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. British government, in the early stages of the negor tiation, to adopt a plan for the suppression, wliich should include the concession of the mutual right of search, by the ships of war of each party, of the ves sels of the other, for suspected offenders. This was objected to by this government, on the principle that as the right of search was a right of war. of a belli gerent towards a neutral power, it might have an ill effect to extend it, by treaty, to an offence which had been made comparatively mild, to a time of peace. Anxious, however, for the suppression of this trade, it was thought advisable, in compliance with a reso lution of the House of Representatives, founded on an act of Congress, to propose to the British govern ment, an expedient, which should be free from that objection, and more effectual for the object, by mak ing it piratical. In that mode, the enormity of the crime would place the offenders out of the protection of their gov ernment, and involve no question of search, or other question, between the parties, touching their respec tive rights. It was believed, also, that it would com pletely suppress the trade, in the vessels of both par ties, and by their respective citizens and subjects in those of other powers, with whom, it was hoped that the odium which would thereby be attached to it, would produce a corresponding arrangement, and by means thereof, its entire extirpation forever. \u2014 A con vention to this effect was concluded and signed in"], [187, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 177 London, on the 13th day os March, 1824, by pleni potentiaries duly authorised by both governments, to the ratification of which certain obstacles have arisen which are not yet entirely removed. The difference between the parties still remaining, has been reduc ed to a point, not of sufficient magnitude, as is pre sumed, to be permitted to defeat an object so near to the heart of both nations, and so desirable to the friends of humanity throughout the world. \u2014 As ob jections, how7ever, to the principle recommended by the House of Representatives, or at least to the con sequences inseparable from it, and which are under stood to apply to the law, have been raised, which may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject, I have thought it proper to suspend the conclusion ofa new convention until the definitive sentiments of Congress may be ascertained. The documents relating to the negotiation, are, with that intent, sub mitted to your consideration. Our commerce with Sw7eden has been placed on a footing of perfect reciprocity, by treaty; and with Russia, the Netherlands, Prussia, the free Hanseatic cities, the Dukedoms of Oldenburgh and Sardinia, by internal regulations on each side, founded on mu tual agreement, between the respective governments. The principles upon which the commercial policy of the United States is sounded, are to be traced to an early period. They are essentially connected with 23"], [188, "178 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. those upon which their independence was declared, and owe their origin to the enlightened men who took the lead in our affairs at that important epoch. They are developed in their first treaty of commerce with France, of the 6th of February, 1778, and by a formal commission, which was instituted immediately after the conclusion of their revolutionary struggle, for the purpose of negotiating treaties of commerce with every European power. The first treaty of the United States with Prussia, which was negotiated by that commission, affords a signal illustration of those principles. The act of Congress ofthe 3rd of March, 1815, adopted immediately after the return ofa ge neral peace, was a new overture to foreign nations to establish our commercial relations with them, on the basis of free and equal reciprocity. That prin ciple has pervaded all the acts of Congress, and all the negotiations of the Executive on the subject since. A Convention for the settlement of important ques tions, in relation to the North West Coast of this continent, and its adjoining seas, was concluded and signed at St. Petersburg, on the of last, by the ministers plenipotentiary of the United States, and plenipotentiaries of the imperial government of Russia. It will immediately be laid before the Se nate, for the exercise of the constitutional author ity of that body, with reference to its ratification. It is proper to add, that the manner in which this ne-"], [189, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 179 gotiation was invited and conducted, on the part of the Emperor, has been very satisfactory. The great and extraordinary changes which have happened in the governments of Spain and Portugal, within the last two years, without seriously affecting the friendly relations which, under all of them, have been maintained with those powers, by the United States, have been obstacles to the adjustment of the particular subjects of discussion which have arisen with each. A resolution of the Senate, adopted at their last session, called for information, as to the ef fect produced upon our relations with Spain, by the recognition, on the part of the United States, of the independent South American governments. The papers containing that information are now commu nicated to Congress. A Charge d'Affaires has been received from the independent government of Brazil. That country, heretofore a colonial possession of Portugal, had some years since been proclaimed, by the sovereign of Por tugal himself, an independent kingdom. Since his return to Lisbon, a revolution in Brazil has establish ed a new government there, with an imperial title, at the head of which is placed the Prince in whom the regency had been vested, by the King, at the time of his departure. There is reason to expect, that by amicable negotiation, the independence of Brazil will, ere long, be recognised by Portugal herself."], [190, "180 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Wish the remaining powers of Europe, with those on the coast of Barbary, and with all the new South American States, our relations are of a friendly cha racter. We have ministers plenipotentiary residing with the republics of Colombia and Chili, and have received ministers of the same rank, from Colombia, Guatimala, Buenos Ayres, and Mexico. Our com mercial relations, with all those states, are mutually beneficial and increasing. With the republic of Colombia, a treaty of commerce has been formed, of which a copy is received, and the original daily ex pected. A negotiation for a like treaty, would have been commenced with Buenos Ayres, had it not been prevented by the indisposition and lamented decease of Mr. Rodney, our minister there, and to whose m tnoTy the most respectful attention has been shewn bv liie government ot -that republic. An advantage ous sit* ration in our treaty with Tunis, has been ob tained, by our consular agent residing there, the of ficial document of which, when received, will be laid before the Senate. The attention of the government has been drawn with great solicitude to other subjects, and particu larly to that relating to a state of maritime war, in volving the relative rights of neutral belligerents in such wars. Most of the difficulties which we have experienced, and of the losses which we have sus tained, since the establishment of our independence, have proceeded from the unsettled state of those rights, and the extent to which the belligerent claim"], [191, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE 181 has been carried against the neutral party. It is im possible to look back on the occurrences of the late wars in Europe, and to behold the disregard which was paid to our rights as a neutral power, and the waste which was made of our commerce by the par ties to those wars, by various acts of their respective governments, and under the pretext by each that the other had set the example, without great mortifica tion, and a fixed purpose never to submit to the like in future An attempt to remove those causes of possible variance, by friendly negotiation, and on just principles, which should be applicable to all parties, could, it is presumed, be viewed by none, other than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relations with every power. In the late war between France and Spain, a crisis occurred, in which it seemed pro bable that all the controvertible principles, involved in such wars, might be brought into discussion, and settled to the satisfaction of all parties. Proposi tions having this object in view, have been made to the governments of Great Britain, France, Russia, and of other powers, which have been received in a friend ly manner by all, but as yet no treaty has been form ed with either for its accomplishment. The policy will, it is presumed, be persevered in, and in the hope that it may be successful. It will always be recollected, that with one of the parties to those wars, and from whom we received those injuries, we sought redress by war.

It was under the influ ence of the latter, that our vessels were likewise seized by the governments of Spain, Holland, Den mark, Sweden and Naples, and from whom indem nity has been claimed, and is still expected, with the exception of Spain, by whom it has been rendered. With both parties we had abundant cause of war, but we had uo alternative but to resist that which was most powerful at sea, and pressed us nearest at home. With this, all differences were settled, by a treaty founded on conditions fair and honourable to both, and which has been so far executed with per fect good faith. It has been earnestly hoped, that the other would, of its own accord, and from a sen timent of justice and conciliation, make to our citi zens the indemnity to which they are entitled; and thereby remove, from our relations, any just cause of discontent on our side. It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the current year, exclusive of loans, will ex ceed 18,500,000 dollars, which, with the sum re maining in the Treasury at the end of the last year, amounting to 9,463,922 dollars and 81 cents, will, after discharging the current disbursements of the year, the interest on the public debt, and upwards of 11,633,01 1 dollars and 52 cents of the principal, leave"], [193, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 183 a balance of more than 3,000.000 dollars in the Trea sury on the first day of January next. A larger amount of the debt contracted during the late war, bearing an interest of six per cent, becom ing redeemable in the course of tfie, ensuing year, than would be discharged by the ordinary revenue, the act of 26th May, authorised a loan of 5,000,000 dollars, at 4\u00a7 per cent, to meet the same. By this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public, of 75,000 dollars. Under the act of the 24th May last, a loan of 5,000,000 dollars, was authorised, in order to meet the awards under the Florida treaty, which was ne gotiated at par with the Bank of the United States, at 4f per cent, the limit of interest fixed by the act. By this provision, the claims of our citizens, who had sustained so great a loss by spol iations, and from whom indemnity had been so long withheld, were promptly paid. For these advances, the public will be amply repaid, at no distant day, by the sale of the lands in Florida. Ofthe great advantages resulting from the acquisition of the territory, in other respects, too high an estimate cannot be formed. It is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury, during the year 1825, will be sufficient to meet the disbursements of the year, including the sum of 10,000,000 dollars which is annually appropriated"], [194, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 184 by the act constituting the Sinking Fund, for the pay ment of the principal and interest of the public debt. The whole amount of the public debt, on the first day of January next, may be estimated at 86,000.000 dollars inclusive of 2,500,000 dollars of the loan au thorized by the act of 26th May last. In this esti mate is included a stock of 7.000.000 dollars, issued for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the Bank of the Untied States, and which, as the stock of the Bank still held by the government, will at least be fully equal to its reimbursement, ought not to be considered as constituting a part of the public debt. Estimating, then, the whole amount ofthe public debt at 79,000.000 dollars, and regard ing the annual receipts and expenditures of the government, a weli-founued hope may be entertained, that, should no unexpected event occur, the whole of the public debt may be discharged in the course of teu years, and the government be left at liberty after wards to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expense, to such other objects as may be conducive to the public security and welfare. \u2014 That the sums applicable to these ob jects will be very considerable, may be fairly conclud ed, when it is recollected, that a laige amount of the public revenue has been applied, since the late war, to the construction of the public buildings in this city, to the erection of fortifications along the coast, and of arsenals in different parts of the Union ; to the"], [195, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 185 augmentation os the Navy; to the extinguishment of the Indian title to large tracts of fertile territory; to the acquisition of Florida; to pensions of revolution ary officers and soldiers; and to invalids of the late war. On many of these objects, the expense will annually be diminished, and at no distant period, cease on most of all. On the first day of January, 1817, the public debt amounted to 123,491,965 dol lars and 16 cents; notwithstanding the large sums which have been applied to these objects, it has been reduced, since then, 37,446,961 dollars and 78 cents. The last of the public debt w ill be redeemable on the first of January. 1835, while there is the best reason to believe that the resources of the government will be continually adequate to such portion of it as may become due; in the interval, it is recommended to Congress to seize every opportunity which may pre sent itself, to reduce the rate of interest upon every part thereof. The high state of the public credit, and the great abundance of money, are at this time very favourable to such a result. It must be very gratifying to our fellow-ciiizens, to witness this flou rishing state of the public finances, when it is recol lected that no burden whatsoever has been imposed upon them. The Military Establishment, in all its-branches, in the performance of the various duties assigned to each, justifies the favourable view which was present ed of the efficiency of its organization, at the last 24"], [196, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 186 session. All the appropriations have been regularly applied to the objects intended by Congress; and, so far as the disbursements have been made, the ac counts have been rendered and settled, without loss to the public. \u2014 The condition of the army itself, as relates to the officers and men, in science and disci pline, is highly respectable. The Military Academy, on which the army essentially rests, and to which it is much indebted for this state of improvement, has attained, in comparison with any other institution of a like kind, a high degree of perfection. Experi ence, however, has shown, that the dispersed condi tion of the Corps of Artillery is unfavourable to the discipline of that important branch of the Military Establishment. To remedy this inconvenience,eleven companies have been assembled at the fortifications erected at Old Point Comfort, as a school for artillery instruction; with intention, as they shall be perfected in the various duties of that service, to order them to other posts, and to supply their places with other com panies for instruction in like manner. In this mode, a complete knowledge of the science and duties of this arm will be extended throughout the whole Corps of Artillery. But, to carry this object fully into effect, will require the aid of Congress; to ob- tain which, the subject is now submitted to your con- sideration. Of the progress which has been made in the con struction of Fortifications for the permanent defence"], [197, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 187 of our maritime frontier, according to the plan de cided on, and to the extent of the existing appropria tions, the report of the Secretary of War, which is herewith communicated, will give a detailed account. Their final completion cannot fail to give great addi tional security to that frontier, and to diminish pro portionably the expense of defending it in the event of war. The provisions in the several acts of Congress of the last session, for the improvement ofthe navigation of the Mississippi and Ohio, of the harbour of Pres qn'isle on Lake Erie, and the repair of the Plymouth Beach, are in a course of regular execution ; and there is reason to believe that the appropriation in each in stance will be adequate to the object. To carry these improvements fully into effect, the superintendence of them has been assigned to officers of the Corps of Engineers. Under the act of the 30th of April last, authoris ing the President to cause a survey to be made, with the necessary plans and estimates of such roads and canals, as he might deem of national importance, in a commercial or military point of view, or for the trans portation of the mail, a board has been instituted, consisting of two distinguished officers of the Corps of Engineers and a distinguished Civil Engineer, w ith assistants, who have been actively employed in carry ing into effect the objects of the act. They have"], [198, "188 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. carefully examined between the Potomac and the Ohio rivers; between the latter and Lake Erie; be tween the Alleghany and the Susquehanna; and the routes between the Delaware and the Rariton. Barn stable and Buzzard's bay; and between Boston har bour and Narraganset bay. Such portion of the Corps of Topographical Engineers as could be spared from the survey of the coast, have been em ployed in surveying the very important route between the Potomac and the Ohio. Considerable progress has been made in it, but the survey cannot be com pleted until the next season. It is gratifying to add, from the view already taken, that there is good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplished. Tt is contemplated to commence early in the next season the execution of the other branch of the act, that which relates to roads, and with the survey of a route from this city, through the southern states, to New Orleans, the importance of which cannot be too highly estimated. All the officers of both the Corps of Engineers, who could be spared from other ser vices, have been employ ed in exploring and surveying the routes for canals. To digest a plan for both ob jects for the great purposes specified, will require a thorough knowledge of everySpart of our Union, and of tlie relation of each part to the others, and of all to the seat of the General Government. For such a digest, it will be necessary that the information be"], [199, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 189 full, minute, and precise. With a view to these im portant objects.

In this mode also, the Military will be incorporated with tlie Civil, and unfounded and injurious distinctions and prejudices of every kind be done away. To the Corps themselves, this service cannot fail to be equally use ful \u2014 since, by the knowledge they will thus acquire, they will be emiuently better qualified, in the event of war. for the great purposes for which they were in stituted. Our relations with the Indian tribes, within our limits, have not been materially changed during the year. The hostile disposition evinced by certain tribes, on the Missouri, during the last year, still con tinues, and has extended, in some degree, lo those on the upper Mississippi, and the upper Lakes. Seve-"], [200, "190 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. rai parties of our citizens have been plundered and murdered, by those tribes. In order to establish re lations of friendship with them, Congress at the last session, made an appropriation for treaties with them, and for the employment ofa suitable military escort to accompany and attend the Commissioners, at the places appointed for the negotiations. This object has not been effected. The season was too far advanc ed when the appropriation was made, and the distance too great to permit; but measures have been taken, and all the preparations will be completed, to accom plish it at an early period in the next season. Believing that the hostility of the tribes, particular ly on the upper Mississippi and the lakes, is, in no small degree, owing to the wars which is carried on between the tribes residing in that quarter, measures have been taken to bring about a general peace among them, which, if successful, will not only tend to the security of our citizens, but be of great advantage to the Indians themselves. With the exception of the tribes referred to, our relations with all the others are on the most friendly footing; and it affords me great satisfaction to add, that they are making steady advances in civilization, and the improvement of their condition. Many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life. The desirable re sult has been brought about by the humane and perse vering policy of the government, and particularly by means of the appropriation for the civilization of"], [201, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 191 the Indians There have been established, under the provisions of this act, thirty-two schools, containing nine hundred and sixteen scholars, who are well in structed in several branches of literature, and like wise in agriculture and the ordinary arts of life. Under the appropriation to authorise treaties with the Creek and Quapaw Indians, commissioners have been appointed and negotiations are now pending, but the result is not yet known. For more full information, respecting the princi ple which has been adopted for carrying into effect the act of Congress authorising surveys, with plans aud estimates for canals and roads, and on every other branch of duty, incident to the Department of War, I refer you to the report of the Secretary. The squadron in the Mediterranean has been maintained to the extent which was proposed in the report of the Secretary of the Navy of the last year, and has afforded to our commerce the necessary pro tection in that sea. Apprehending, however, that the unfriendly relations which have existed between Al giers and some of the powers of Europe, might be ex tended to us, it has been thought expedient to aug ment the force there, and, inconsequence, the \" North Carolina.\" a ship of the line, has been prepared, and will sail in a few days to join it."], [202, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 192 The force emit1 yed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the neighbouring seas, for the suppression of pira- cy, has likewise been preserved essentially in the state in which it was during the last year. A perse- vering effort has been made f >r the accomplishment of that object, and much protection has thereby been afforded to our commerce, but still the practice is far from being suppressed. From every view which has been taken ofthe subject, it is thought tnat it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish our force in that quarter There is reason to believe that the piracies now complained of, are committed by bands of robbers who inhabit the land, and who. by preserving good intelligence with the towns, and seiz- ing favourable opportunities, rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessels, of which they make an easy prey. The pillage thus taken, they carry to their lurking places, and dispose of afterwards at prices tending to seduce the neiglibouring population. Tiie combination is understood lo be of great extent, and is the more to be deprecated, because the crime of piracy is often attended with the murder of the crews, these robbers knowing, if any survived, their lurking places would be exposed, and they be caught and punished. That this atrocious practice should be carried to such extent, is cause of equal surprise and regret. It is presumed that it must be attributed to the relaxed and feeble state ofthe local govern ments, since it is doubted, from the high character of the Governor of Cuba, who is well known and much"], [203, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 193 respected here, that if he had the power, he would promptly suppress it. Whether those robbers should be pursued on the land, the local authorities be made responsible for these atrocities, or any other measure be resorted to, to suppress them, is submitted to the consideration of Congress. In execution of the laws for the suppression ofthe Slave Trade, a vessel has been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of Africa, with orders to return thence by the usual track of the slave ships, and to seize any of our vessels which might be engag ed in that trade. None have beeu fuund, it is believ ed, that none are thus employed It is well known, however, that the trade still exists under other flags. The health of our squadron, while at Thompson's Island, has been much better during the present, than it was the last season. Some improvements have been made, and others are contemplated there, which it is believed, will have a very salutary effect. On the Pacific, our commerce has much increased; and on that coast, as well as on that sea, the United States have many important interests, which require attention and protection. It is thought that all the considerations which suggested the expediency ofplac ing a squadron on that sea, operate with augmented force, for maintaining it there, at least on equal extent. 25"], [204, "194 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. For detailed information respecting the state of our maritime force on each sea, the improvement neces sary to be made in either, in the organization ofthe Naval establishment generally, and of the laws for its better government. I refer you to the Report of the Secretary ofthe Navy, which is herewith communi cated The revenue ofthe Post Office department has re ceived a considerable augmentation in the present year. The current receipts will exceed the expen ditures, although the transportation of the mail with in the year has been much increased. A Report of the Postmaster General, which is transmitted, will furnish, in detail, the necessary information, respecting the ad ministration and present state of this Department. In conformity with a resolution of Congress, of the last session, an invitation was given to General La Fayette to revisit the United States, with an assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of France, which he might designate, to receive and convey him across the Atlantic, whenever it might be con venient for him to sail. He declined the offer ofthe public ship, from motives of delicacy, but assured me that he had long intended, and would certainly visit our Union in the course ofthe present year. In Au gust last he arrived at New York, where he was re ceived with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which his very important and disinterested services"], [205, "195 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE and sacrifices, in our revolutionary struggle, so emi nently entitled him. A corresponding sentiment has since been manifested in his favour throughout every portion of our Union, and affectionate invitations have been given him to extend his visits to them. To these, he has yielded all the accommodation in his power. At every designated point of rendezvous, the whole population of the neighbouring country has been as sembled to greet him; among whom it has excited in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all, to behold the surviving members of our revolutionary contest, civil and military, who had shared with him in the toils and dangers ofthe war, many of them in a decrepid state. A more interesting spectacle, it is believed, was never witnessed, because none could be founded on purer principles, none proceed from higher or more disin terested motives. That the feelings of those who had fought and bled with him, in a common cause, should have been much excited, was natural. There are, however, circumstances attending these interviews, which pervaded the whole community, and touched the breasts of every age, even the youngest among us. There was not an individual present, who had not some relative who had partaken in those scenes, nor an infant who had not heard the relation of them. But the circumstance which was most sensibly felt, and wliich his presence brought forcibly to the recol lection of all, was the great cause in which we were"], [206, "196 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. engaged, and the blessings we have derived from our success in it. The struggle was for independence and liberty, public and personal, and in this we succeeded. The meeting with one who had borne so distinguish ed a part in that great struggle, and from such lofty and disinterested motives, could not fail to affect pro foundly every individual, and of every age It is na tural that we should all take a deep interest in his su ture welfare, as we do His high clams on our Union are felt, and the sentiment universal that they should be met in a generous spirit. Under these impressions, I invite your intention to the subject, with a view, that, regarding his very* important services, losses, and sa crifices, a provision may be made and tendered to him, which shall correspond with the sentiments, and be worthy the character, of the American people. In turning our attention to the condition of the civilized world, in which the United States have al ways taken a deep interest, it is gratifying to see how large a portion of it is blessed with peace The only wars which now exist within that limit, are those between Turkey and Greece, in Europe, and be tween Spain and the new governments, our neigh bours, in this hemisphere. In both these wars, the cause oflndependeuce, of Liberty, and Humanity, continues to prevail. The success of Greece, when the relative population of the contending parties is considered, commands our admiration and applause, aud that it has had a similar effect with the neigh-"], [207, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 197 bouring powers, is obvious. \u2014 The seeling os the whole civilized world is excited in a high degree, in their favour. May we not hope that these sentiments, winning on the hearts of their respective govern ments, may lead to a more decisive result, that they may produce an accord among them, to replace Greece on the ground which she formerly held, and to which her heroic exertions, at this day, so emi nently entitle her? With respect to the contest, to which our neigh bours are a party, it is evident that Spain, as a power, is scarcely felt in it. The new States had completely achieved their independence, before it was acknowledged by the United States, and they have since maintained it, with little foreign pressure. \u2014 The disturbances which have appeared in certain portions of that vast territory, have proceeded from internal causes, which had their origin in their form er governments, and have not yet been thoroughly removed. It is manifest that these causes are daily losing their effect, and that these new States are set tling down, under governments elective and represen tative in every branch, similar to our own. In this course we ardently wish them to persevere, under a firm conviction that it will promote their happiness. In this, their career, however, we have not inter fered, believing that every people have a right to in stitute for themselves the government which, in their"], [208, "PRESIDENT'S MESSa\\GE. 198 judgment, may suit them best. Our example is be fore them, of the good effect of which, being our neighbours, they are competent judges, and to their judgment we leave it, in the expectation that other powers will pursue the same policy. The deep in terest which we take in their independence, whicli we have acknowledged, and in their enjoyment of all the rights incident thereto, especially in the very im portant one of instituting their own governments, has been declared, and is known to the world. Se parated, as we are, from Europe, by the great At lantic Ocean, we can have no concern in the wars of the European governments, nor in the causes which produce them. The balance of power between them, into which ever scale it may turn, in its various vi brations, cannot affect us. It is the interest of the United States to preserve the most friendly relations with every power, and on conditions fair, equal, and applicable to all. But, in regard to our neigh bours, our situation is different. \u2014 It is impossible for the European governments to interfere in their con cerns, especially in those alluded lo which are vital, without affecting us; indeed, the motive which might induce such interference in the present state of the war between the parties, if a war it may be called, would appear to be equally applicable to us. It is gratifying to know, that some of the powers with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse, and to whom these views have been communicated, have appeared to acquiesce in them."], [209, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 199 The augmentation os our population, with the ex pansion of our Union, and increased number of States, have produced effects in certain branches of our system, which merit the attention of Congress. Some of our arrangements, and particularly the judiciary establishment, were made with a view to the original thirteen States only. Since then, the United States have acquired a vast extent of terri tory; eleven new Slates have been admitted into the Union, and territories have been laid off for three others, which will likewise be admitted at no distant day. An organization of the Supreme Court, which assigns to the judges any portion of the duties which belong to the inferior, requiring their passage over so vast a space, under any distribution of the States that may now be made, if not impracticable in the execution, must render it impossible for them to dis charge the duties of either branch, with advantage to the Union. The duties of the Supreme Court would be of great importance, if its decisions were confined to the ordinary limits of other tribunals; but when it is con sidered that this Court decides, and in the last resort, on all the great questions which arise under our con stitution, involving those between the United States individually, between the States and the United States, and between the latter, and foreign powers, too high an estimate of their importance cannot be formed. The great interests of the nation seem to require that"], [210, "200 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. the Judges of the Supreme Court should be exempt ed from every other duty than those which are in cident to that high trust. The organization of the inferior Courts would, of course, be adapted to cir cumstances. It is presumed, that such a one might be formed as would sscure an able and faithful dis charge of their duties, and without any material aug mentation of expense. The condition ofthe Aborigines within our limits, and especially those who are within the limits of any of the States, merits likewise particular attention. Experience has shewn, that unless the tribes be civil ized, they can never be incorporated into our system, in any form whatever. It has likewise shewn, that in the regular augment ation of our population, with the extension of our settlements, their situation will become deplorable if their extinction is not menaced. Some well digested plan, which will rescue them from such calamities, is due to their rights, to the rights <>f humanity, aud to the honour of the nation. \u2014 Their civilization is indispensable to their safety, and this can be accom plished only by degrees \u2014 The process must com mence with the infant state, through whom some ef fect may be wrought on the parental Difficulties ofthe most serious character present themselves to the attainment of this very desirable result, on the territory on which they now resitie."], [211, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 201 To remove them from it by force, even even with a view to their own security and happiness, would be revolting to humanity, and utterly unjustifiable. \u2014 Be tween the limits of our present States and Territories, and the Rocky Mountains and Mexico, there is a vast territory to which they might be invited, with inducements which might be successful. It is thought, if that territory should be divided into districts, by previous agreement with the tribes now residing there, and civil governments be established in each, with schools for every branch of instruction, in literature and in the arts of civilized life, that all the tribes now within our limits might gradually be drawn thither. The execution of this plan would necessarily be attended with expense, and that not inconsiderable; but it is doubted whether any other can be devised, which would be less liable to that objection, or more likely to succeed. In looking to the interest which the United States have on the Pacific Ocean, and on the Western coast of this continent, the propriety of establishing a military post at the mouth of Columbia river, or at some other point in that quarter, within our ac knowledged limits, is submitted to the consideration of Congress Our commerce and fisheries on that sea and along the coast have much increased, and are increasing. It is thought that a military post, to which our ships of war might resort, would afford protection to every interest, and have a tendency to 26"], [212, "UNITED STATES. 202 conciliate the tribes to the North West, with whom our trade is extensive. It is thought also, that by the establishment of such a post, the intercourse be tween our western States and Territories and the Pacific, and our trade with the tribes residing in the interior, on each side of the Rocky Mountain, would be essentially promoted. To carry this object into effect, the appropriation of an adequate sum to au thorise the employment of a frigate, with an officer of the Corps of Engineers, to explore the mouth of the Columbia river, and the coast contiguous thereto, to enable the executive to make such establishment, at the most suitable point, is recommended to Con gress. It is thought, that attention is also due to the im provement of this city. The communication between the public buildings and in various other parts, and the grounds around those buildings, require it. It is presumed, also, that the completion of the Canal from the Tiber to the Eastern Branch, would have a very salutary effect. Great exertions have been made, and expenses incurred, by the citizens, in im provements of various kinds; but those which are sug gested, belong exclusively to the government, or are of a nature to require expenditures beyond their re sources. The public lots which are still for sale, would, it is not doubted, be more than adequate to these purposes."], [213, "PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. 203 From the view above presented, it is manifest that the situation of the United States, is in the highest degree prosperous and happy. There is no object which as a people, we can desire, which we do not pos sess or which is not within our reach. Blessed with government, the happiest which the world ever knew, with no distinct orders in society, or divided interest in any portion of the vast territory over which their dominion extends, we have every motive to cling to gether which can animate a virtuous and enlightened people. The great object is to preserve those bless ings, and to hand them down to our latest posterity. Our experience ought to satisfy us that our progress, under the most correct and provident policy, will not be exempt from danger.

Extending, as our interests do, to every part of the in habited globe, and to every sea, to which our citizens are carried by their industry and enterprise, to which they are invited by the wants of others, and have a right to go, we must either protect them, iu the en joyment of their rights, or abandon them, in certain events, to waste and desolation.

Against foreign danger, the policy ofthe govern ment seems to be already settled. File events of the late war admonished us to make our maritime frontier impregnable, by a well digested chain of for tifications, and to give efficient protection to our commerce by augmenting our Navy to a certain ex tent, which has been steadily pursued, and which it is incumbent upon us to complete as soon as circum stances vvill permit. In the event of war, it is on the maritime frontier that we shall be assailed. It is in that quarter, therefore, that we should be prepared to meet the attack. It is there, that our whole force will be called into action to prevent the destruction of our towns, and the desolation and pillage of the interior. To give full effect to this policy, great im provements will be indispensable. Access to those works, by every practicable communication, should be made easy, and in every direction The inter course also between every part of our Union, should be promoted and facilitated, by the exercise of those powers which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principles of our Constitution.

Although it is with regret, that the writer per ceives the above six items of Eirata to have crept into the present work, yet in performing the duty of notic ing the same, he acknowledges that he finds himself more than compensated for the misfortune, by the op portunity, which this notice affords him, of mentioning to those of his respected readers who may not already be acquainted with the fact, that the portion of coun try which he has denominated \" North West Terri tory,\" is included within the jurisdiction of \"Michi gan Territory,\" the whole being provisionally under one Governor appointed by the United States.

I am peculiarly gratified likewise, in referring my readers to a certain route traced upon the sheet-map belonging to this work. It is from the Western ex tremity ofthe State of Missouri, to the city of Santa Fe in New Mexico. It commences near Fort Osage, striking upon the Arkansa, and along the ascending direction of that and the Semerone rivers for several hundred miles, thence leads to, and across the chain of mountains at a practicable pass, and thence direct into the territory of New Mexico; striking,, in the first instance, upon the settlemeni of Taos, and continuing on thence to the city of Santa Fe. This, being the track actually pursued by the very remarkable Cara vans, or Wagon-expeditions, fitted out, in the course of last year, by our enterprising Missouri citizens. They consisted of four distinct caravans or companies, fitted out in February, May, August and November; with views of trading, in part with the Indians for peltry, but in greater part with the Spanish Americans for gold and silver. The November party, and some portion of the others are still on their travels, or per haps, now in winter quarters, on the banks ofArkan sa, and may return home in the spring, or summer."], [244, "UNITED STATES. 234 In relation to what has been accomplished, and what has been brought to light through these expe ditions, there has been, within the last week, a regu lar and circumstantial communication made to Con gress, now in session. On the reading whereof, we are told, the members of the House were little short of being electrised with astonishment, at the wondrous things brought into view, by the details of the narra tion as it proceeded. The shock, indeed, it appears, on this occasion, was ofa complex nature: for it was made up, in part of that kind of romantic surprize which some ofthe\" Tales of the East\" have the fas cinating power to excite, whilst the auditory ever per ceived something present, to remind them they were receiving impressions, not of Fairies and Fairy-land, but of real existences actually abiding in these regions of the\" West:\" \u2014 in part also, made up of that impres siveness, which, the many so very unexpected re alities, presented for consideration, created in the mind, proportionate to the vast importance which the knowledge of them was understood as being pregnant with They were presented under such a point of view, as to raise up ideas of available resources throughout the countries spoken of, in waiting only to be called forth, for the extension of our individual and national career of enterprize to a degree, and with a novelty in the mode, far beyond what has, until the present time, been dreamed of, even by imaginations the most exalted amongst us."], [245, "UNITED STATES. 235 But, the writer of these pages, not wishing either to be enthusiastic in expression, or to be thought so in his feelings, will endeavour to do, even upon this topic of excitement, like as he has done upon other occasions, that is to say, in stating to his readers, facts as he finds them, he will endeavour not only to be plain, but also not to exceed the probable reality; and therefore, he has no more than simply to add; that, Congress having at this moment the subject regularly before them, it will be legislated upon in such man ner and degree as may appear most conducive to the public weal ; or, in other words, there will probably be made, such provision and such proper arrangements as the occurrence shall appear to require, for duly protecting and facilitating the United States' com merce with the Interior possessions of Mexico, or other Spanish American provinces or possessions, and for establishing the same on a safe and permanent basis. The arrangements to comprehend, as a mat ter of course, all needful measures for fixing and maintaining a friendly and commercial intercourse with the Indian tribes generally, both West and East of the mountains. Such is the matter, claiming just now to be acted upon ; which the writer would not willingly have fore gone the opportunity of thus taking notice of, al though he cannot, as yet, present it as more than an embryo occurrence of the day. Possibly, at some lit tle distance of time from the present, in the event that"], [246, "236 UNITED STATES. \" these few lines\" be not received with an unfavoura ble accueil, and that he should w live and do well.\" he may have the gratification of presenting a few supple mentary ones. Along with which, in that case, he will, if he be enabled so to do, exhibit, by a Statistical Comparison between things at that supposed time, and the time now or lately present, the progress which this particular branch, or circle of the United States1 commerce; \u2014 taking within its circumference, the Great slope of continent West of the Oregon Mountains, in which are situate the Valleys ofthe Multrwmah and Bonaventura rivers doum to the Pacific ocean, together with the Spanish American provinces or possessions more to the South and Soidh East; \u2014 shall then have made. It might have been stated above, that the caravan ef last summer, on arriving at Santa Fe, separated; and such parts of the company as were not willing to conclude their outward adventures there, pro ceeded farther; some South toward the Passo del Norte, and into New Biscay ; some South Westwardly toward the Gulf of California, and some taking the descent, Westward, of the Continental slope to the Pacific. The gold and silver mines situate in New Biscay, Senora, and Sinaloa, which our adventurers purposed visiting in their excursion, are numerous, and said to be the richest of all the mines in those metals."], [247, "UNITED STATES. 237 With regard to a few particular distances from Santa Fe, it might also have been stated, that to the nearest point of the Arkansa river, is about two hun dred and fifty miles, to the nearest branch of the Kansas about three hundred and ten miles, and to the Red river, about seventy miles. The surface of what has been termed \" Internal provinces\" of Mexi co, is stated, upon authorities in the country, as measuring very near one million of square miles. And now, as the writer finds himself compelled in good earnest to take leave of his readers, he begs to devote this very last moment to the purpose of re spectfully observing to them, that if it so should hap pen, there is little or nothing discovered in all that his labours, throughout this volume, have produced, which is of a character that can claim to be classed with either the \" useful,\" or the \" agreeable,\" he would in that case, or indeed, whether he be so un fortunate or not, presume to refer them, for an at tentive perusal, to Governor Clinton's address on the 4th instant, to the legislature of the State of New York; because, there they may be certain of not meeting with disappointment in either respect.
