It Avas about three o'clock, and Garden Lane was almost deserted, the children being at school, and their elders at the factory. Two or three loud-voiced, slatternly women appeared and disappeared at the cottage doors, looking after the babies who seemed to have casually dropped into the squalid life of the place, and the decrepit old folks who were near to dropping out of it. \u2022. VOL. I. B"], [12, "2 A GARDEN OF MEMORIES I Even in its peaceful condition the lane did not seem likely to attract visitors. Yet a couple of well-dressed men lingered there, talking earnestly, and had already lingered for ten or fifteen minutes, though there were pleasanter spots within easy reach. The elder of the two, a taU, neat, gray whiskered man of sixty or more, stood on the footpath, with his back to the cottages, and poked at the dust with a slim gold-headed cane. His companion, much younger than himself, had halted in the roadway, and Avas speaking rather defiantly, with his hands in his pockets. It was natural enough that the elder man should raise his eyes from time to time, and that they should rest on the waU that faced him. But the other had his back to it, and it was less obvious why he should cast quick glances over his _ shoulder, as if the wall made a third in the conversation. They were curt, half-hostile glances, and yet it .vas the pleasantest thing to look at in Garden Lane. It was a substantial piece of old-fashioned brick.vork, Avhich rose Avith an air"], [13, "I AVITHOUT 3 of strength, almost of stateliness, above its sordid surroundings. Its base was polluted Avith the filth of the street, and defaced Avith smears and chalk-marks, but higher up it took the southern radiance on its warmly coloured bricks, touched here and there with lines and patches of bronze tinted moss, and over its crest, against the hlue June, nickered little Avanton sprays of ivy and Adne. By standing very near the unsavoury cottages the sunlit boughs of trees within the enclosure might be descried. The two men, however, betrayed no such ex treme curiosity. There was a small door just opposite, set in the .vah, Avith a projecting ledge of brickAvork above it, on which a tuft or two of snapdragon grew, and thin, dry grasses seeded airily. Evidently it was seldom opened, for the chUdren had made Uttle erections of stones, and dirt, and oyster-shells, upon the threshold. The elder man's eyes lingered familiarly on the little entrance, as if he could see some pleasant sight beyond, but the other, when he turned to look,"], [14, "4 A GARDEN OF MEMORIES i ignored the door .vay, and flung his glances higher, where theglowing lineof red bounded the sultrysky. \"You know me,\" he said, with a touch of resentment in his tone. \" You ought to kno av me weU. You knoAV I don't Avant to do anything but what is fan and right.

But his companion made no answer. He continued to smile, looking down and drawing vague lines in the dust at his feet. \" Why don't you teU her she'U never get such an offer again?\" The point-blank question roused the other to stare and exclaim, \" Bless the man !

The other smiled a little. \" All right; \u2014 caU for you at four,\" he said."], [22, "II WITHIN \" Roses that down the alleys shine afar, And open, jasmine-muffled lattices, And groups under the dreaming garden-trees.\" Mr. Thomas Brydon, standing a Uttle apart from the tennis players, eyed the coveted garden Avith stealthy eagerness. He knew its precise extent and shape better than any other person present, but the vision which had haunted him for months was that of a somewhat irregular four sided patch, washed over with a unUorm tint of light green, bounded by pen-and-ink lines, and conveniently supplied with a scale of measure ment and the points of the compass. The de-"], [23, "II AVITHIN 13 lineation was accurate enough, yet the reality took him a little by surprise. He had had some idea of the ordinary suburban garden, with its neat machine -mown lawn and yeUow gravel walks, its sUm young trees, laburnum and Urne, and its gay stripes and masses of bed ding plants. He had walked many a time in such gardens, and remembered their weU-raked borders, their standard roses bearing pendent labels, and their latest novelties in variegated foliage. He knew the rock -work in a shady corner, dotted here and there with Uttle home sick ferns. AU these things were familiar to him. But not this waUed enclosure, where every thing told of long continuance. So many genera tions had laboured within its bounds, each its aUotted span, so many seasons of sunshine and rain had quickened the great trees whose white roots were groping far below, that it seemed as if one need only turn a spadeful of the deep black earth for buried memories to germinate and bloom."], [24, "14 A GARDEN OF MEMORIES n Spring flowers here were hut the last links in a long garland, stretching across the years to hands that tended those same blossoms in pleasant old fashioned times. It was like the quaintest mas querade, only to think of the women who had Avalked in that garden. Who was the first \u2014 the Avoman for whom the pleasure-ground was planted? And was Mary Wynne to be the last ? Already it was but a narrow plot compared to what it once had been. TaU buUdings hemmed it in, turning blank walls on its green seclusion. Here Avas massive warehouses, there, above a quivering screen of poplar leaves, rose a heaped confusion of tiled roofs, a bit of torrid colour in the midsummer sunlight, slopes of varied steep ness, blackened in places with soot and moss. Little long-drawn clouds drifted from their clustered chimneys across the AVestern sky. There was a gray glitter of glass in distant Avindows, but it was strange how remote all eyes seemed to be from Miss Wynne's shady lawn. Half a minute had sufficed to give Brydon a"], [25, "15 II AVITHIN distinct impression of his surroundings. Then with no change of attitude he lowered his glance and surveyed the company. His young hostess had given him the Avelcome that Eddington had promised, ancl had only turned away to greet a later arrival. He looked after her, curiously, anxiously \u2014 his impression of her was anything but distinct. Hoav was this ? She had talked to him for at least a couple of minutes, and Brydon believed himself to he quick at reading faces. He began to suspect that perhaps he had never looked at her while she spoke. The tennis party was an ordinary specimen of such gatherings in a provincial town. There were a good many ladies. Elderly clergymen had brought their Avives and daughters, and the wives and daughters of busier men had come with apologies for their absentees. Tvvo or three lads, just old enough to be reckoned as grown-up from a laAvn-tennis point of vie.v, loitered about, always keeping together, and looking on the women, the old people, and polite manners generaUy, as"], [26, "16 II A GARDEN OF MEMORIES hindrances to rational enjoyment. The legal pro fession was represented by Mr. Eddington, smUing and talking in every direction, and a self-possessed junior partner. There was a good-looking country squire who had driven in, with two sisters and a cousin, from a manor-house some four or five miles away. And finally there was a curate from his lodgings in the High Street. Some of the girls were pretty, but Brydon's eyes seeking Miss Wynne Ungered only on a taU, willowy young woman, as distinct from aU the rest as if she were a foreigner. In point of fact, her dwelling-place was nothing more remote than Kensington, whence, being a Uttle tired, she had come for ten days' change, and was restfuUy going through the three tennis parties, one flower-show, and one reopening of a church, which her friends had offered as a round of gaiety. Brydon's glance encountered hers, for she was gazing fixedly at him from under her slanted parasol while she talked to Mr. Eddington. His story interested her, it was an excitement, an"], [27, "17 II AVITHIN enthusiasm, a struggle for mastery, and the issue was uncertain. Perhaps it might be divined by a little study of the young man. She was Uke a traveller landed on an unknown shore, ignorant of the local scale of values. She took no interest in the good-looking squire, decidedly the most important person there ; she passed by the curate and the young lawyer with complete indifference, but she expressed a wish to make Mr. Brydon's acquaintance, and the next moment she was rustling softly over the grass Avith Mr. Eddington in attendance. Brydon saw them coming, and felt a shock of surprise and alarm. What the deuce did Eddington mean by it \u2014 couldn't he mind his own business, and leave other people alone ? But he had not presence of mind enough to attempt an escape, and he stood, shifting un easdy from one foot to the other, till he was captured, and duly presented to Miss HiUier. The worst of it was that her progress across the lawn had attracted attention. The boys, standing strictly on the defensive behind a conA^enient tree, VOL. i. c"], [28, "18 A GARDEN OF MEMORIES n silently conveyed to one another that she was a guy. Their sisters looked after her with curiously mingled feelings of disapproval and envy. Their own freshly-made costumes somehow seemed too new, and too neatly put on, by the side of those faintly -coloured folds which twisted and traded and clung about the Kensington young lady. It was true that the draperies and soft laces which composed a harmony in yellows were sUghtly tumbled and dingy. One felt that they had been worn in a smoke-laden atmosphere, and crushed in crowded little drawing-rooms. But, neverthe less, there Avas an air of indefinable superiority about Miss HUlier's dress, a careless completeness of detaU, to the yeUow beads at her throat, and the cluster of yeUow roses, which seemed half ready to faU, so loosely were they fastened. Two sisters stood watching her, and the younger, a pert schoolgirl, spoke under her breath. \"You don't caU her pretty, I hope \u2014 a limp, affected thing ! And I do think when people go to parties they might be clean ! I should like to"], [29, "19 II AVITHIN send that dress to the wash \u2014 looks as if she had slept in it.\" \" Yes,\" said the elder Avith a doubtful smde, \"perhaps it does.

I assure you we won't aUow it.\" \"What will you do?\" he said, and, half-smd ing, he looked at her. Miss HUlier's thoughts flashed from the ques tion to Brydon's eyes. They Avere his only beauty, for he was not a handsome man. He Avas shghtly below the average height, he had a saUoAv skin, very ordinary features, and a thin moustache that"], [31, "21 II WITHIN scarcely shaded his upper lip. But for his eyes he would have been insignificant. They however were fuU of expression, and their depths of trans parent gray were deepened and darkened by the black lashes that bordered them. \"Eyes Uke agates,\" Miss HilUer said afterwards, \" really too beautfful for a man of business.\" \"What would we do?\" she repeated after a momentary pause. \" WeU, really, I hardly know. Part you by main force, I suppose.\" \" But anyhow Miss Wynne and I must settle it at last, you know ? \" She made a little affirmative sign. \" Yes, and I tremble for the result.

I would run no risks. If an answer were absolutely necessary, I would send a little message by that nice, talkative Mr. Eddington.

It had displeased him that his cherished scheme should be made the subject of jesting talk, but a shy man naturaUy likes to be told that a woman finds him formidable. \"I don't know how I should manage \u2014 I'm afraid you would be too clever for me,\" he said. \"I should have to try and make my way in in disguise.\" \" What, as the milk or the washing, or to look"], [33, "II WITHIN 23 at the gas-meter ? But seriously, Mr. Brydon, do you reaUy mean that you would have the heart to destroy aU this ? \" He looked round dehberately and calmly. He had forgotten his shyness in the interest of the question.

Against their soft dimness Miss HilUer's slender, yellow draped figure, fair dishevelled hair and refined face, came out like a picture, a little faded and pale, yet with a certain charm.

Mary was the possessor of these treasures, both literary ancl artistic, and also of some information concerning Philip's career. She knew that his father and mother were both dead, and that an uncle of his mother's had brought him up in a kindly, slovenly fashion, permitting him to do very much as he pleased, and rather ignoring than sanctioning his desire to be an artist. The old gentleman hated scenes, and arguments, and de cisions, and let matters drift, from unwiUingness to act. Of late, however, matters had not been going so smoothly. Mr. Frere had put some money into a mine which appeared to be of extraordinary depth.

The old lady never kept a com panion for more than half a year. She thought them moderately satisfactory for two months, she endured them for two more, and then quarrelled with them till they left.

Yet it seemed to Mary that the hardest time to bear had been the few weeks between the day when she found herself mistress of what to her was con siderable wealth, and the day when the purchase of the house and garden was completed. She had been forced to hide her feeUngs, Philip had never said or done anything Avhich would entitle her to avow them.

There, recovering from her terrible anxiety, she waited for him. Through every change of season, through every hour of the day, the old house was ready for his return. The Avorld widened as she thought of him. Had he gone to New Zealand ? to America ? Was there not even a continent of which she might think certainly that it held Philip ? Eivers and mountains seemed to conspire against that innocent love.

She remembered Mr. Brydon, a Uttle shuffling, blinking, gray-haired man, who sat not far from her at church. Dead ! She sauntered idly to and fro, looking up at the wall, blank and blind behind a tracery of leafless boughs. She was in terested in death, but not in Mr. Brydon.

It seemed to her afterwards that it was the last peaceful day she was ever to have there. That one day the looms were still ; and Thomas Brydon, in his suit of newest black, with crape on his hat, sat in the mourning-coach, stood by the grave's edge, with the slow clanging of the bell in his ears, and did the melancholy honours of a well- spread table at his suburban house.

Before the day was out he appeared in Eddington's office, inquiring whether Miss Wynne would be willing to sell her house and garden. He was prepared to offer her a hberal price. Eddington communicated with his client, and wrote a negative answer. Miss Wynne did not wish to part with her property. Brydon apparently acquiesced, but he began to make a stir in the town about the disgraceful condition of Garden Lane, and three courts that led out of it.

He wrote a letter to the local paper, pointing out the hideous overcrowding Avhich was a shame to a civihsed place.

They had met pretty often in the interval, and"], [88, "78 A GARDEN OF MEMORIES IV the young man was more conversational. He spoke of the interest which had been excited by his letter to the Brenthill Guardian. \"But it's very little good,\" he said. \" Plenty of talk, but something must be done.\" \" Something ought to be done,\" Eddington admitted. The mUl-OAvner got up and stood on the rug. \"Do you know what I've come for?\" he said, looking down. \" Well, I can guess,\" Mr. Eddington replied. \" I must have that garden.

She had a nosegay in her hand, and Avas herself a dehcate and flower-like presence in the unsavoury Uttle thoroughfare.

Mrs. Humphreys was examining her acquisition rather doubtfuUy, clutching the stems in one unclean hand, while with the other she hitched her cap on one side and scratched her head.

If it had fallen off, it is questionable whether, even in Garden Lane, any body but Mrs. Humphreys would have cared to pick it up. It would have found its right place in the gutter, but at present it was exalted on Mrs. Humphreys's head, and looked decidedly drunk. Brydon considered the old woman's dingy wrinkles, the red-rimmed eyes, the streaks of gray hair on her forehead, the half-fastened gown, and the pale SAveet petals of the roses. \" You've got some pretty flowers there,\" he said. \" Pretty enough,\" Mrs. Humphreys replied. \"She give 'em me,\" nodding in the direction of Mary Wynne's flight. \" They're weU enough for gentlefolks.\" \" Well, they're sweet for aU of us, aren't they ?\" \" I daresay.\" She thrust her nose among the tea-scented blossoms. \" They're weU enough, but give me a bit of old man \u2014 that's what I Uke ; or a bunch of waUs.\" Brydon wondered whether there was any touch of sentiment in these preferences.

To Brydon it seemed that she was failing in some mysterious way, and yet not yielding, as if some third person had come into their duel and upheld her weakness.

PhUanthropy, accord ing to Brydon, had to be made to pay, and re quired to be sharply looked after. He would neither rob others of their wages nor forego his own. He was deaf to all distant cries for help ; earthquakes, colhery explosions, Indian famines, fires, could not extract a halfpenny from his pocket ; the facts were sad, but they were not in his department, and he was not, as he bluntly said, either big enough or fool enough to under take the world's Avork. Given health, he meant to do his own, and it was as much as he could manage. He would never have looked at Mary Wynne if she had not been throAvn in his Avay as an obstacle ; he Avould have paid her the price of her garden, and forgotten everything but her name Avhere it stood in his cheque-book.

How had he thought of .vomen before ? Well, he had thought mostly of those who worked in his factory, and he had thought of them with a rough sense of pity and fair play. \" Give 'em a chance,\" he had said scores of times, \" let 'em be decently housed, fed, and clothed \u2014 yes, and decently taught, and they'll be decent women.\" And for that he had planned his cottages.

The walled garden had become to him a part of Mary Wynne's charm \u2014 the one explained the other. In destroy ing it he Avould destroy possibilities, perhaps bhght the flowering of other delicate souls. One might grow a very good sort of woman in his little houses, but not Mary Wynne. Nor was that all. He had thought much of the clean and well-appointed dwelUngs which he would erect, but when he saw how utterly earth, air, and water could be defiled, he stood aghast. No doubt while he lived he could guard his pro perty, but, if he should die, might not the evU which had befallen Garden Lane come upon his cottages too ? Might they not be let and sublet, and swarming famdies pour in to multiply in their squalor and improvidence Avhere Mary's bushes of myrtle and bay, Mary's great cedars and clustered roses, were rooted now ? So to deface what she loved seemed a thing impossible, like laying cruel and violent hands on Mary herself.

No, it was a choice between the garden and Garden Lane. Was it a choice ? It seemed to Brydon that the choice was made for him. How was he to tear this new and strange influence out of his heart ? He believed that it would lead him Avrong, and yet it Avas the sweetest and tenderest feeling of which he was capable. \" WeU,\" he said at last, knocking the ashes out of his pipe, and sitting down to work at his untidy table, \" she is out of reach now, and when she comes back I daresay she will say ' No.' \" But though he said it he did not really believe it.

So the days went by in their unresting pro cession, the momentous days that were yet so strangely uneventful.

Yet, though she assured herself that aU was over, she carried a faint hope on her journey through the drizzling afternoon. In the omnibus, in the booking-office, in the train, which as she neared home slid ever and anon out of the foggy dusk into wayside stations, where gaslights shone with watery lustre on tarpauhn and mackintosh, in eArery pause she looked for some one or some thing to interpose at that eleventh hour. Even on the crowded platform at Brenthill a possibility lingered, fading slowly as she drove homeward through the ugly familiar streets, dying as her own door closed behind her, and she was received by a melancholy maid who had face-ache, and who said that nothing had happened, and nobody had called.

To give up his sacrifice \u2014 that was an absurdity, and yet that Avas what he found it hard to do.

Mrs. Leicester had perceived that important young men were fatally apt to fall in love in a Avrong, or, Avhich Avas much the same thing, in an eccentric fashion, and she had deter mined that if Frank would but choose some one fairly unobjectionable she would ask no more.

It would be great promotion for Tiny to be mistress of the old Manor House, which was a paradise to her girlish fancy, but Frank's mother was quite ready to welcome her there, and was very good meanwhile in the matter of invita tions. Mrs. Leicester was an amiable, kindly, easy-going woman, and was really fond of the ghl, yet in her fierce motherly fondness she would have sacrificed her any day, body and soul, for Frank. Tiny must take care of herself. If Frank wanted her, well and good, but if the young prince should chance to discover a more suitable princess else where, his little cousin must go back to her OAvn people, heart-A\\diole or heart-broken as she might chance to be. Mrs. Leicester's thoughts turned from Frank and Tiny to her expected visitors, and drUted idly in the past, to which they belonged.

MUdred Fairfax was not required in Frank's version of the romance. Aunt Carrie told no more stories, \u2014 she was dead before the young lover reached India, and Mrs. Leicester, looking back across the long years which parted her from her favourite sister, felt a mournful pleasure in taking up the unfortunate love story of whose earhest beginning she had been the confidante.

The sound of wheels passed through her pleasant dream, which was harcUy so much dispersed as a httle more defined when Mr. South stood on the hearthrug where Frank had stood a couple of hours earlier. He spoke in soft deliberate tones, and looked round the room with a covert inquiry in his glance.

She expressed some views on the subject of punctuahty which seemed to make him hotter. \" We went farther than I intended \u2014 we went along the river after I saw Huntley, and had to hurry back.

He made the most of his time, but it was a heavy-browed and rather suUen young host who made his appearance some minutes after dinner was announced, and offered his arm to Mrs. Austin with a muttered apology. Frank was pro foundly dissatisfied with his guests ancl himself. People who were busy with their love affairs Avhile he was a tiresome Uttle boy getting over the measles belonged altogether to a peculiarly uninteresting past, and the consciousness that he had been wanting in politeness made him angrily uneasy. He made up his mind about Mrs. Austin and Mr. South between his spoonfuls of soup. There was a slight likeness between them at the first glance. It was hardly enough to suggest the"], [208, "198 MRS. AUSTIN I idea of brother and sister, but they might have been cousins. They were both taU, fair, and pale ; they were very quiet, and when they spoke it was with a subdued clearness of tone, and with a little more finish than Frank himself. The resemblance made them stiU more uninteresting, and the soft voices struck him as slightly affected. So far as they were concerned, he saw precisely the pair of faded lovers he was prepared to see, but he noticed that Tiny, whose cheeks were a little flushed, and whose pulses were a httle quickened by their haste and her fear of his mother's displeasure, looked peculiarly vivid and young by the side of the newcomers. There was something happy and eager in her utterance of the most commonplace remarks, which Frank had not observed before.

He would not have Tiny scolded for that afternoon's misconduct, and he watched his mother's manner so jealously that"], [209, "199 I MRS.

She turned away with a hardly perceptible smile, and spoke to GUbert South. It was a httle better when the ladies left the dining-room, for Frank contrived to exchange a smile of reconciliation with his mother as he held the door, and so went back to his duty with a somewhat brighter face. But it Avas not mueh better. These people were not to his taste. They had the air of having seen and known things beyond the range of Culverdale society, and Frank felt shy, young, and half-defiant as he sat over his wine with GUbert South. He suspected his guest of possibly laughing at his youth and awkwardness. It is true that there was nothing in Mr. South's manner to justify the suspicion. He did not look like a man who was in the habit of laughing at his neighbours; but Frank was in an unreason able mood that evening. He held himself aloof Avhen they went into the drawing-room, stiU with"], [210, "200 MRS.

Mrs. Austin rose from her seat by Mrs. Leicester, came out of the shadows into the meUow lampbght, and Avalked to the piano.

He had been too sulky and absorbed to pay any attention before; he had had her hand on his arm \u2014 fool that he was ! \u2014 and had taken no heed.

It was not such beauty as Frank had ever taken pleasure in, or even recognised, before, and for that very reason he was unable to set any limit to his admiration. The charm was that of a pale gleam in an un- known sky, reArealing a new Avorld. He was startled at the sudden rush of feeling which carried him out of the narrow boundaries within which he had been eating, drinking, and sleeping till that moment. It seemed to him as if none of the thoughts and words to which he had been accustomed in that earlier Use would serve him now. He had scorned poetry as something foolish and unreal ; but it struck him that if he took up a volume of poetry he might chance to find it all coming true.

She laid her hand on the back, but paused, listening. Looking eagerly at the two as they stood side by side, Frank forgot that he had ever seen a resemblance between them, and would have taken it as an insult if any one had suggested that such a resemblance existed. The secret love story, over which he had laughed that afternoon, rose up terribly before his eyes. He remembered every word he had said, how he had proposed to give them their wedding-breakfast, and how he had joked with Tiny about the elderly bride. He hated himself as he recalled the word.

She did not appreciate the carefully kept hedges, enclosing stubble and turnips, nor the prim Uttle plantations which looked Uke preparatory schools for young trees, nor the small spire which rose with an air of the utmost decorum above a neat churchyard. \" There is Frank !\" said Tiny Vivian. They all turned to look at the distant figure, which Tiny, who knew the road that he Avould take, had recognised. Frank was seen for a moment on a gentle ascent and then lost behind a clump of trees, but the glimpse remained Avith Mrs. Austin as a little picture.

Just beyond the field where the cow is.\" Two minutes later they pulled up by the road side, at the point nearest to the ruins, and the party set out to walk the brief remainder of the way. There was no difficulty in finding the Castle. It stood, together with a small haystack, in the corner of a dreary little field, and consisted"], [259, "MRS.

The good lady sat doAvn on a fallen stone to con sider the idea, whUe he undertook to walk round the ruins and inspect them more thoroughly. For this purpose he joined the other two, who were gazing up at the tower. \" I don't know anything about it except that it is very old,\" Miss Vivian was saying as he came up.

The tower was of a blackish gray, crusted with lichen ; the grass at its foot was rank, the spreading docks grew coarsely from the Ul-drained soU, and a sluggish Uttle stream crawled a Uttle way off. \" People talk of fortresses frowning,\" said Mrs. Austin ; \" I think this would if it could.
