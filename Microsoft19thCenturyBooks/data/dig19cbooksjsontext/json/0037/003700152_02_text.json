Perhaps she savoured most of the latter, to judge by the clatter and tramp, anything but feminine, that heralded her approach through the little lobby, to open the door. To it had come Jonathan Cleare, the blacksmith. VOL. II. 1"], [10, "JONATHAN. 2 As he passed the window, he could not help seeing Miss Lynn moving about in the sunny parlour, preparing a neatly-laid break fast on a little tray. The sun was shining on the smooth brown hair, drawn from her face, and twisted round her head in a way that spoke both of care and of carelessness. Care to be scrupu lously neat and clean, carelessness as to what set the large twists of hair took, or how their arrangement might be most becoming. Not that Jonathan dissected the motives of the schoolmistress in this fashion. He only knew it was the face of the grey bonnet on Sundays, the face he had seen flushed from teaching in the school, bonnetless now, and fresh as a new-blown rose in the early morning. Daphne was circumspect. Her mother never came down to breakfast : and she would not, therefore, ask Jonathan Cleare to come in.. Besides, she and her mother"], [11, "EASTER EVE. 3 had decided, when they came to Shelbourne, that they would \"keep to themselves.\" She could not be quite sure that they had kept to their resolve, when she remembered the great luncheon at Mr. Falk's, and one or two visits to the cottagers when they were in trouble, and when she saw the young blacksmith waitino- at the door for herorders about the church decoration. But after all, how much pleasanter life had become both to her and to her mother since they had innocently infringed the rigour of their rule ! She went out to speak to Jonathan, trust ing the tray, with her mother's breakfast, to Eliza Ann. \" Good-morning, ma'am,\" said Jonathan. \" I came along to see what I could do for you. My mother understood you to say you wanted me here on Saturday \u2014 that's to-day ?\" \"Wanted you here ? O no.\" said Daphne. 1\u20142"], [12, "4 JONATHAN. And then, seeing Jonathan colour, she co loured too, at her own awkward speech. \" I mean I should not have thought of troubling you, only Mr. May said you could put some wire across the window-sills in the church ; and it was he that wished me to ask you to look in there to-day.\" \" My mother's very dull of hearing,\" he answered \u2014 and Daphne could not help see ing that he showed ever so slightly that her first words had annoyed him \u2014 \"and that's how the mistake's come. Perhaps Mr. May will let me know, then, when it is I am wanted.\" \" When it is convenient to you to come to the church, I think. Some of the girls and I are going to put the flowers in, and we can do the windows any time before dark, that it suits you to come, Mr. Cleare.\" Jonathan coloured again, slightly. He was not used to be called Mr. Cleare. There had been a time when he looked something"], [13, "EASTER EVE. 5 like the name, and when strangers' lips had called him by it. But now he looked at his fingers soiled with iron rust, and at the broad palm that had grown hard from work, and then at his coat, mended indeed by the little mother at home, but looking worn as a blacksmith's coat must look \u2014 and it seemed to him that the neat, delicate, well-dressed schoolmistress was mocking him, when she called him Mr. Cleare. Mr. Cleare ! why, in her eyes what else could he be but a great clumsy workman . And his eyes fell upon a pair of small white hands folded loosely be fore him, on a soft grey dress. Jonathan knew Miss Lynn too little, or he was too proud to put his feelings into words. What could it matter what she thought of him, or what she called him ? He was only the blacksmith, sent for to stretch wires in the church. But Daphne was quick to read the human face, when that face was so honest as to wear"], [14, "JONATHAN. 6 no mask, and to change with every shade of feeling. She saw that she had in some way wounded Jonathan's feelings. She would try to make him amends. \" I could come down in five minutes just to show you what is required,\" she said humbly, afraid of making another mistake. \" Perhaps you will walk in, till I have put on my bonnet .\" Jonathan was hesitating, and on the point of refusing, when a crash as of lightning, thunder, and teacups silenced him. Daphne gave a resigned sigh. But following on the crash came a scream, which terrified her. It was her mother's voice. She fled upstairs as if she were on wings. Little was to be seen of poor Mrs. Lynn, who lay, like Pompeii, buried in her own beauties. Daphne's little blue and white cups, given her by her father, the china tea pot and cream-jug, everything, was either a"], [15, "EASTER EVE. 7 hopeless mass of bits upon the floor or upset upon the bed : and all over the poor blind woman's hands and arms the tea-pot had emptied itself. These hands, scalded and blistered, were the first things that Daphne saw. Mrs. Lynn was holding them up and wringing them helplessly over the debris of china and soaked bread and butter that surrounded her. Daphne could not speak. She could not scold Eliza Ann, who stood there, sullen and stolid, saying and doing nothing. She felt she had only herself to blame ; she that had been deceiving herself into thinking she was charitable, and who had been sacrificing her nearest and dearest all the time to her own whim. She was too distressed, too angry with her self to cry. But as she tied up her mother's hands tenderly with cold cream and a soft handkerchief, Mrs. Lynn could feel that she was trembling."], [16, "JONATHAN. 8 \" Oh, mother !\" she said once remorse fully, under her breath ; that was all. It was like another being, the Miss Lynn who came quietly downstairs ten minutes later, followed by Eliza Ann in her hat and shawl. She was quite pale, and Jonathan could see she had been crying. She did not seem to notice him, as she took hold of the sullen girl's hand, and led her gently to the door. Jonathan saw her lay her hand on the thread-bare shawl, and then he saw a thing that almost took his breath away. He could not hear what Miss Lynn said, nor did he try to listen ; but he saw her draw the sullen stolid face towards her, and kiss it. And then the stolid look gave way, and the tears ran over the plain, hard face ; and the poor girl brushed her rough red hand across her eyes, and tramped out to the gate, letting it bang behind her."], [17, "EASTER EVE. 9 Daphne Lynn stood a moment looking after her. Then she came in, closed the door, and sank wearily into a seat in the parlour. \" I forgave her everything,\" she said at last, in a piteously sad tone \u2014 \" everything that I could. She took my money and my clothes ; she broke almost everything I had ; and I thought if she only did not hurt my mother it would not matter. But I see now I have been deceiving myself, forgetting my duties at home, and trying to do charities abroad. I have no judgment. I am not fit to teach children. I ought to do plain sewing, to keep me quiet and in my right mind.\" \" I'm glad you've sent her away,\" said Jonathan, a little shyly. He was quite taken by surprise at being made the confi dant of the woman that a few moments be fore he had thought was mocking him. This child-like distress, and the sudden expres-"], [18, "JONATHAN. 10 sion of it, was what he never had expected from Miss Lynn. But he had learnt to know that every time he saw her, a new side of her character was unveiled. The side shown him to-day moved his heart strangely. He could enter somewhat into the bitterness of disappointed hopes : he was, at least, so much nearer her than he had been an hour ago, that he could pity her. She saw his sympathy in his kind, honest face, though he did not attempt speech. \" You have had trouble, too,\" she said. \" I know you have had disappointments. I have heard how you might have been \" Something stopped her. She felt she was too much of a stranger to touch upon this man's silent struggles and victories unin vited. And Jonathan did not help her. He would have given a good deal for words just then, but they came to him so slowly. Miss Lynn rose, and tied on her bonnet."], [19, "EASTER EVE. 11 \" I am sorry to have kept you so long,\" she said. \" We can go to the church now. And on the way, is there any one you could tell me of who would wait on my mother, now Eliza Ann is gone ?\" \" My mother could come in for to-day,\" said Jonathan ; \" and afterwards there's Martha Male 'ud do for you. Or, if it was only for an hour or two, there's Jael Thorne; she can't leave the old gentleman long to gether, but she'd be glad to earn a shilling any way she could.\" Jonathan went in to speak to his mother, while Miss Lynn walked on to the church. When she got there, she found the school girls had not arrived ; but Mr. Falk was in the porch, and a great basket of cut flowers was swinging on Ben Brewer's arm. Daphne did not try to conceal her delight and gratitude for his generosity. But Aaron Falk's services were not to end there. When Jonathan reached the church, with"], [20, "JONATHAN. 12 a wire and hammer in his hand, Aaron Falk was standing on steps, arranging the moss on the window-sills for Miss Lynn. Two school-girls beside her were tying primroses into bunches. Mrs. Myse was creeping about, all smiles, and contentment, and ad miration. \" We needn't keep you, thank you, Jona than,\" said Mr. Falk, from his eminence on the steps ; \"I can do all that is required here.\""], [21, "CHAPTER II. ANDREW. ITH warmer days, and perhaps be- cause a long time had now passed '\u25a0'p \u25a0'\u2022\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0''-\u25a0\u25a0* since his leg was broken, Andrew Male took to regular work again. This in itself helped him to regain strength, and the second and the third Aveek he felt much less tired than the first ; and so the old routine of the labourer's life began for him anew. But he Avas an altered man for all that, and all his mates knew it. He had ahvays been steady and hardworking, not given to"], [22, "JONATHAN. 14 \"larks,\" as they called it; but his had ahvays been the merriest laugh Avhen a joke went round, and the clearest Avhistle that came from the plough as it turned up the deep furrows, was the tuneful Avhistle of Andrew ; and though he Avas not tall like Jonathan, he could shoAv a chest and a pair of stout arms against any man. Now, he seldom seemed to hear a joke, or if he did, he smiled grimly and said nothing. He followed the plough first, and later the drill and the harrow, in silence, dragging himself along in a half-Aveary half-lazy way that was new to him. He stooped too, Avhich made the broad chest look narrower ; and the men he Avorked Avith could make nothing of him. The little boys Avho guided the plough Avhile he led the horse, often had a sharp word throAvn to them, and his temper seenied to vary continually : from sullen hard work to moody idleness, no one knew Avhich way, as they expressed it, the \"fit"], [23, "ANDREW. 15 Avould take him. \" Some evenings he worked on an hour after the other men had gone home ; on other days he asked the time, or Avatched the sun going doAvn in the sky continually ; and at the first stroke of the hour that ended the labourer's day, he would fetch his coat and wallet, and tramp off hur riedly towards home. \" Not as he got nothin' to do Avhen he gits here,\" said his mother \u2014 \" but guru over the fire, or stand in the doorway w\\ his hands in his pockets.\" It was a time Avhen any man with a ten dency \u2014 from AA*hatever cause \u2014 to drink, Avould have become a constant visitor to the Red Inn. Happily AndreAV had no leaning that way, inherited from father or from mother, and his OAvn tastes would never lead him to it. He could take a pint of beer at the inn like other men, but he knew when to stop better than they did. And it never occurred to him that the company at the"], [24, "JONATHAN. 16 tap-room, or the beer to be found there, Avould minister to his trouble ; rather he shrank from the company, and took his pint at home. As the days grew longer, and the even ings less cold, the fireside Avas more and more left for the doorAvay. There, in the gloaming, he stood sometimes for hours, watching the darkness stealing over the village, and feeling the hush that evening in country places brings Avith it. He found some strange comfort in it ; the tAvilight and the stillness were more in keeping Avith his frame of mind than the happier light and sound of day. At those times his very trouble greAv dim and indistinct. A sense of injury, of grievous wrong done to him, clung about him still.

He kneAv not."], [25, "ANDREW. 17 Only, therefore, to the Avorld about him his dull sullen hate went out. On such nights, Jonathan going from the forge to his cottage often passed him by. Sometimes he saw Andrew in the doorway, and then he Avould ahvays come toAvards the garden gate and ask him how he did. The time Avas over for AndreAv's questionings. Jonathan felt that, and had nothing to fear in facing his mate ; and Andrew could not help seeing that Jonathan feared nothing : that he looked him full in the face when they met ; that he did all in his poAver to drive away the cloud that hung between them. And yet the cloud hung there : and Andrew could not dispel it. He sometimes' longed for one word from Jonathan that he could lay hold of, one awkward look, one sign that now as before his mate avoided him. Then he Avould have it out, for better or for Avorse.

Andrew felt it was not possible, and yet his mother's words came back to him, a thousand mocking echoes seemed to lend their horrid help to his suspicion, and he must keep silence. In the bitterness of his soul he cried out often, like the troubled psalmist, \" Hoav long, O Lord, how long .\" For little 'Scilla, his poor 'Scilla of past days \u2014 he knew she was happy. Jael had told him that she had been to see her once, and that she was quite contented, having the child with her. Through the Avinter, when"], [27, "ANDREW. 19 coals were dear, and the wind bitter, he often comforted himself thinking that she Avould fare better even in the workhouse than in old Josiah's home, where food and firing were ever scanty. And though per- haps he hardly kneAv it, his feeling toAvards 'Scilla was not quite, could not be quite, what it had been. Something stood be- tween her and him, like the something that stood between him and Jonathan. But in the one case it was the dread suspicion : in the other it Avas the thought of that child \u2014 the child that 'Scilla loved. She had never loved him, surely : and yet she had love somewhere, it seemed, after all. Not that he wished anything away from her that brought her contentment. It Avas from the very depth of his love that he was able to find comfort in the knowledge that she, at least, did not suffer. But now as the spring came on, and the sounds of piping thrushes and chattering 2\u20142"], [28, "JONATHAN. 20 starlings, and the sight of primroses opening in the copses, and ferns unrolling their ten der green heads in the hedge-rows \u2014 as all these things came back to earth and to him, there came also, keen and fresh, the remembrance of last year's spring, and of 'Scilla's happy child-like delight and wonder at what seemed now to AndreAV to be re turning, to a blind and thankless Avorld. The neAv life abroad and stirring seemed to have come into his being : but only to change the dull numbed pain of winter for the pain of returning consciousness. He had thought little of primroses and sing ing birds before : noAv he kneAv by the trouble they brought him that they Avere bound up Avith the happiest moments of his\" life.

One soft still evening in May, when the Aveight of the newly-awakened pain was pressing at its heaviest on Andrew's spirit, Jonathan came across from the forge. \" You'll Avalk Avith me a bit, won't you, 'DreAV .\" he said, with his hand upon the gate; \" it's such a wonderful fine ev'ning.\" Any change must be a relief. Andre av followed his friend on to the road, and across the village green, Avith his hands in his pockets. He had a strange hope that something might come of that walk, some light upon the darkness.

There could not but be a certain embarrassment, iioav that the two friends so long estranged found themselves each alone in the com pany of the other. Jonathan, perhaps, was most conscious of this, because Avith him there was no other consciousness to overpower it. Andrew knew more than that they had been long es tranged ; he felt that there had been a cruel cause for it. Why he was in Jonathan's"], [31, "AN EVENING WALK, WITH CLOUDS. 23 presence noAv, he could not tell. The same mist of uncertainty and suspense he had so long lived in enfolded him still.

It is at these times of absolute poAverless ness that Ave best realise that poAver that we call (too often irreverently) Providence. We are not leading ourselves ; some one else has taken us by the hand. \" Where are you goin' .\" he asked, indif ferently, as Jonathan, having crossed the green, directed his steps toward the church yard. \" Only going to look in,\" was the answer. \" It looks like summer having the wire doors shut, and the others left open.\" \" It needs air, the church does,\" said An dre av. \" It's wonderful damp o' Sundays.\" \" Yes, if the Squire never did us another good turn he did us that one. They must have cost a deal of money, those gates.\""], [32, "JONATHAN. 24 They found the churchyard gate locked. But Jonathan threw his long legs over the railings without difficulty, and 'DreAV, with less ease, folloAved him. There was a high mild Avind bloAving ; the moon was nearly at the full, and set in a deep grey sky. Drifts of Avhite cloud hur ried over her face continually, and Avhen they passed beneath her, she shed a dull red light upon their outer edge. Here and there, out of bays of deep grey, a bright star tw*inkled. The elms in the church yard Avere waving lazily in the night Avind. Jonathan pressed his face against the wires, and looked into the church. A flood of silver light was pouring in. It fell upon the moss on the window sills, and upon the shapes of delicate feathery fronds of ferns leaning against the glass ; and out of the moss there looked Avhite blossoms, vividly Avhite as they caught the moonlight in the"], [33, "AN EVENING WALK, WITH CLOUDS. 25 dark building. The knight Avith his visor doAvn was sleeping in the shadows, and the little harmonium sat in darkness, just the Avhite edges of the hymn-books upon it showing through the gloom. \" The church Avas never noticed like that before,\" said AndreAV. \" The schoolmissus is very handy, I take it : she done it all, so folks say.\" \" She did all the tasty part,\" said Jona than ; \" I helped her to stick on some of the moss, and such rough Avork as that.\" \" I thought Mr. Falk done that,\" An drew said, indifferently, turning away; \" all the folk Avere chattering about him and her making a match of it, and that. I didn't take any count of it, but I thought it like enough. It 'ud be a good match for the schoolmissus.\" Jonathan kicked a large stone, half buried in the grass, and sent it spinning to the gate. Then he said \u2014"], [34, "JONATHAN. 26 \" Folks said right, and I said right too. Mr. Falk put up the moss at Easter ; and I put it up at Whitsun; and that's the rights of it, if anyone Avants to know.\" \" You needn't take offence,\" said 'Drew Avearily. What could it matter to him, who put the moss in the church ? He had other thoughts to trouble him. \" I'd like to go round the shrubbery at the Place,\" he said, as they left the churchyard ; \" it's so light, everyone can see who it is, and we can't do no harm going. They walked up the approach, and struck off to the right of the big Avhite house, past the place where the bed of daffodils grew earlier in the year, and into the deserted, neglected grounds. \"I've not been here ever so long, have you .\" said Jonathan. Andrew threw up his head, and said, \" I've not been here since \u2014 not since April"], [35, "AN EVENING WALK, WITH CLOUDS. 27 twelvemonth. She brought me here to help her carry the Lenten lilies as Mr. Myse let her pick.\" \" Do you mean 'Scilla .\" asked Jona than. \" Who else ?\" he answered, as if there Avere but one Avoman in the world. AndreAV Avas longing to pour outhis heart, as in the old days, to his friend. He looked quickly into Jonathan's face, AA*hen he said, \"Do you mean 'Scilla?\" Jonathan Avas looking at him just as in times past ; there w*as not a trace of consciousness written there, not even the embarrassment that their long silence upon that subject might haA*e made quite natural. In his friend's pre sence, the horrid fears, the hateful suspicion that had haunted Andrew of late, melted away. He forgot for a time that he had ever felt them. \" I daresay you think as I've forgotten about her. It's like enough. It seems so"], [36, "28 JONATHAN. easy sometimes to forget. But the thought of her's with me day and night. I can't away Avith it.\" \" I did think, may-be you were getting by it,\" said Jonathan, not knowing Avhat else to say. \" It's not like as I ever shall, not till I knoAV the rights or the wrongs of it for cer tain. To know as there's someone a-goin' about, Avho's the blackest enemy ever a man had ; and to know he's goin' scot free, and 'Scilla shut up between them Avork'us AA'alls,. all along o' him \u2014 it's a hard thing to bear, I tell'e, Jonathan ; and many's the time I think I won't bear it long. I don't see as I can, not much longer.\" \" Do you think it 'ud make it easier to bear if you kneAv ?\" said Jonathan, half frightened by AndreAv's sullen, determined Avords, the full meaning of which he could not understand. If AndreAv's hfe were to be consumed by the fire of this hopeless"], [37, "AN EVENING WALK, WITH CLOUDS. 29 searching for the truth, by this sullen hate that seemed to have turned in upon him self for Avant of the outlet of a natural indignation, Jonathan Avas not the one to sacrifice his friend, even for Jael and Josiah Thome's comfort, still less for Aaron Falk's good name. Jael and Josiah would be pro vided for; the God of justice Avould see after them. And as for Aaron Falk \u2014 what was he doing to make Jonathan keep his black secret longer? What was he doing to deserve Jonathan's forbearance and silence so long ? He Avould keep to his agree ment ; he Avould Avarn Aaron Falk first, and then tell Andrew. To Andrew's keen ears, intent on finding out the truth somewhere, and alive to every change of expression or of tone, Jonathan had already betrayed himself. The Avay in which he had asked, \" Do you think it would be easier to bear, if you knew ?\" carried to Andrew's heart the conviction that Jona-"], [38, "JONATHAN. 30 than Avas not in the same darkness as himself.

It would have been almost as hard for him to tell them out to all the village gossips as to confide them to his mother and to 'Drew.

God had never sent him any fierce trouble heretofore, but neither (so it seemed to him) would He send liim any great good fortune.

His father there, he seem a little better when it gits warm.\" \" Well, we can't order our weather, can we?\" said Martha Male. \"The Lord knows a deal better than we do what we want.

There was no dejection then in the brewer's gait. It seemed to Jonathan each time that his fate must have been decided, so elastic was his quick tread, his face set in such satisfied repose. One evening, a soft June evening, the well-known step came by. Mr. Falk made a point of not looking at the Cleares' house as he passed. He looked straight ahead, and to-night he was whistling softly.

Mr. Falk had something large done up in a newspaper, which he held with both hands. He was crossing the road now to the school-house gate. Jonathan hardly knew why he did it, but he opened the gate and let it slam noisily. Then he leant against it, with his arms folded. He wanted Aaron Falk to see that he was watching him.

Why was he to have all the smooth sailing and the green pastures, while other and better men smarted under the rod of an unjust fate? He walked as far as the gate and looked down the playground to the school-house. There was the brewer in the doorway, and Miss Lynn herself was letting him in. Jonathan turned on his heel. What a fool he had been. What was all this about, this rising in his throat, this heat in his face, this thumping of his heart ? What could he do, if Miss Lynn chose to marry Aaron Falk ?

Should he speak this one word? The one word that could ruin Aaron's hopes, and \u2014 set Miss Lynn free ? It was getting late \u2014 it was time to speak now, if the word was to be said, the word that would save her. And would it not be misery to a woman like Daphne Lynn to be married to Aaron Falk ?

And if the brewer could do base things, there was no need for Jonathan to follow him. He would be straightforward, Avhat ever he did. But he could say the word, and yet be true. He could meet Aaron Falk, and give him warning that very night, that to morrow his secret should be a secret no longer. Not for his own sake, said Jonathan, but for hers.

He thought there Avas a sound of reproach in her tone. He had quite forgotten the boAV he had made her in a jealous impulse long ago. Daphne had forgotten it too, till now. Jonathan raised his cap.

The first sacrifice had involved another; for if he had been away noAv, and a prosperous mechanic, this face would never have troubled him. And it was the one face he knew that could. Rosy, comely, country maidens had never touched Jona than's heart, and made it ache. It was the still, pale face, which bewitched Aaron Falk, that had conquered him at last. And yet he could say nothing to her ; he could only hold his peace. What would his fourteen to nineteen shillings a-week (and hoAV hardly earned they were), and his humble trade, look in her eyes ?

Perhaps the grandfathers of both were on the same footing ; but a step once made among the humbler classes is not easily forgotten, or given up. Once a farmer's daughter, always a farmer's daughter. The son of a labourer could be no match for her. He should never tell, he knew, hoAV strangely her presence stirred him. He Avas a man of few Avords ; and where his feelings were concerned, Jonathan became a sealed book. And, as for speaking now, what was there to say ? He did not hope to have the schoolmistress for his wife ; at least, he said he did not. He only wanted to see her, to Avatch her, to have a look sometimes into the depth of those grey eyes."], [123, "TOWARDS EVENING. 115 She was going to be the brewer's wife, all the people said. Should he care to look into her eyes then ? Could he do it then ? Jonathan started when that thought came to him, and said he had no hope. She was going to have a good home, and he hoped she would be happy. He could not help feeling that she must be happy anywhere, because anywhere she would be loved. Presently the children came defiling through the field. Mr. May said grace. Miss Lynn marshalled them quietly into their places. It was wonderful hoAV she managed them, without any loud orders or bustle. She lifted her hand, or let it fall, and all the hundred and ten bright little eyes hung upon it, and understood the sign.

The sunbeams danced out and in over the white cloth, and over the par terre of gay Sunday hats and cloaks. And, as hunger was satisfied, voices began to rise in a happy half- whispered babble. \"You may talk as much as you like, my dears,\" said Mrs. Myse, rubbing her hands, and smiling. \" We Avish you to be happy, as well as good to-day.\" This had the effect of producing a deep"], [125, "TO WARDS EVENING. 117 and profound silence.

Mr. May and Mrs. Myse Avere there ; Miss Sophy and Miss Maria, farmer Bates' daughters, and two or three other assistants were there. Daphne Lynn was there, and a child was clinging to her skirt ; and close behind her, trying, as Jonathan thought, to put himself betAveen her and the rest of the group, stood Aaron Falk. Jonathan came up to Mrs. Myse, and touched his hat. \" Shall you Avant me any more, ma'am ?\" he asked. \" Not to help, thank you, Jonathan, but we shall want you to have tea, after all your kind exertions.\""], [128, "120 JONATHAN. \" No, thank you, ma'am,\" he began ; but Mrs. Myse, turning to Daphne, said \u2014 \" Miss Lynn, Avould you kindly make Jonathan a cup of tea ?\" Daphne Avent to the table at once ; the child still clung to her skirt, and followed her. \" I am afraid it is cold, Mr. Cleare,\" she said; \"you must be very tired; won't you sit doAvn ?\" \" No, thank you,\" he answered ; but he came and stood near her, only a few feet from her.

Ben Brewer and Jael had been clearing the table ; they were putting the mugs one into the other, and laying them in the basket. And the cry came from Jael's lips. Daphne ran to her. \" What is it, Jael ? What is it ?\" she said, kneehng down on the grass beside her, for the poor woman had sunk down upon it, and was as pale as marble.

She's coming round again.\" Mr. Falk looked vexed. \" Alfred, dear,\" said Mrs. Myse, calling him aside and holding his button, \"may I ask poor Mr. Falk to supper ?

And, if the truth be told, he was as anxious as she was that Miss Lynn should marry his good friend, Mr. Falk. So he nodded his assent. Aaron Falk was not engaged ; he would be most happy to come. He went about amongst the children all the remainder of the afternoon, playing Avith them, even SAvinging them. He talked to the women who sat in groups upon the grass with their babies ; he held the trans parently thin parasol over Mrs. Myse's head while she did the same.

He could never be a traitor and break his promise, even to Aaron Falk ; but he might have let another do it, and been blameless ; the cup, so close to the brewer's lips, might have been snatched away at that moment, but for his foolish impulse. Another instant, and Jael would have betrayed at least that, in some way, Aaron Falk had wronged her, that the sight of him had \" upset \" her, as she said. Even at that moment, Jonathan knew that the first impulse had been the right one : But, O God, he said to himself, how hard the right way seemed !

It seemed to him that that one quiet movement of his hand was all that stood betAveen him self and Daphne Lynn, and he him self had upheld the barrier that divided them. A moment after, he remembered all the other barriers that Jael's Avords could never have removed. He remembered that if Miss Lynn refused Aaron Falk to-day, it would not make him, Jonathan, a fit match for her. His eyes fell. He turned them on Daphne Avith a look of penitence, as if he had been doing her an injury. Ah, if she could know the devil that possessed him sometimes, she would not be walking with him noAv. \"It has been very hot,\" said Miss Lynn ; \" you ought not to have worked as you did.\" But they both knew by her tone"], [139, "\"PIMPERNELS DOZING.\" 131 that she was quite aware her question had been unansAvered. They Avent slowly on in silence. The cool grass was pleasant to their tired feet ; the sound of Daphne's dress upon the daisies made a soft rippling accompaniment to their troubled thoughts. So soft, that at last the trouble melted away, and only the rippling went on, sooth ing them all, and making the sweet even ing sweeter. The sun was only halfway down the heavens ; it was still too warm for walking fast, even if Jael's strength had been equal to it. \" I'm keepin' you long,\" said Jael, her hand still on Daphne's shoulder. \" I can walk now, Jonathan, lad, without your arm, on'y keep a-nigh me a while longer.\" \" We are not in any hurry,\" said Daphne, \" we like going slowly ; at least,\" she added, hastily, \" I can answer for myself.

Yet Avhat had he hoped for ? Dahpne saw the change. She wondered how she had pained him. She watched him as they turned down the lane. What Mrs. Myse had said was very true. There was something very \" reliable \" about Jona than. And it seemed to her there was something more in him than that.

She held out her hand as they reached Josiah Thome's cottage and said, \" Will you give me those pimpernels ?\" He looked up with a quick keen glance. Was she mocking him and his half-shut flowers ? But there Avas no mockery in her face. And silently he gave her the flowers.

The farmers' daughters, who spelt indifferently and dressed Avorse, looked Avith condescen sion only upon Daphne Lynn, who had to earn her bread, and teach naughty village children all day long. No wonder she always dressed so quietly ; Avhat else could she afford ?

It flattered him, poor man, that he should have anything they cared to share with him.

In later life we wonder at the pain it was possible in youth to suffer ; or we forget that such suffering ever was for us, and smile over the foolish, imaginary griefs of a younger generation, with the complacency of a longer experience and a superior wisdom. But the pain is none the less hard to bear, because half its sting is added by the growing-pains of youth. And it is enough to say that Jonathan suffered as the young only suffer. All the more he suffered, because no one had yet found the key to the locked chamber Avhere he hid away all that seemed to him too sacred for telling. Not that he would"], [158, "JONATHAN. 150 put it in that way ; for he was little given to naming or analysing, and only kneAv that it could not be Avith him as it Avas with An drew, who poured out his heart freely so soon as it Avas burdened. The more a thing weighed upon Jonathan's mind, the more he kept silence. It was the worse for him in more Avays than one, for he had many a stab from his friend's lips that he might have been spared, if he had been less reticent, and Andre av more discerning. But the time had come for even An dreAv's eyes to be opened. He had been too long a scholar in the school of affliction not to see that his friend was another man, after the encounter in the shrubbery Avalk. And iioav it Avas his turn to keep silence. He felt he could not touch upon Jonathan's trouble unsolicited. Plain AndreAv was conscious that his friend's reserve set its"], [159, "ANDREW'S DREAM. 151 seal upon his lips also. A man of keener intellect and coarser mind would have felt no scruple in telling Jonathan that he had discovered his secret. Andrew Avas the re verse of this ; if his intelligence had not helped him to guess the truth before, his feelings prevented his intruding the know ledge of it upon Jonathan noAv. But the careless allusions to Miss Lynn and Aaron Falk ceased. The schoolmistress became a sealed subject between the two friends. And Andrew came oftener than ever to the forge, and took his mate out with him to have a Avalk, or to smoke on the bench outside the house. Sometimes, if Jonathan were out later than usual, after some job in the village, he would find 'Drew sitting on his bench, wait ing for him. Jonathan Avould have brought a book, and read while he Avaited : Andre av never read, except out of his prayer-book on Sundays. He sat cross-legged, holding"], [160, "152 JONATHAN. his knee, or Avhittled a stick with his pocket knife. One sultry August evening, ten days after the walk Avhich had decided Jonathan's fate, 'DreAV sat longer than usual cross-legged on the bench, Avaiting for his friend. Though it was past Avork -hours, the sun was still hot, and the air heavy. AndreAv soon became drowsy. His head went back on the black boards of the shed, for Jonathan's shop was a humble wooden building ; and his eyes closed. But still the sun glared doAvn on him. It seemed to Andrew that as it travelled do\\vn the side of heaven it came nearer, burned brighter, and stared him in the face. He got up impatiently, and tried the forge door, which was closed. It was locked, but he knew where to find the key, under a wreath of wild clematis that Jonathan had trained over the Ioav roof. He opened the door. The cool darkness"], [161, "ANDREW'S DREAM. 153 more than rewarded him for the exertion of rousing himself to find the key, which he had done sulkily enough, Avinking his heavy eyes, and using strong language alternately to the sun and to the door. Leaving it ajar, he threw himself on a bench, crossed his arms to make a pillow for his head, and fell asleep. Meanwhile Jonathan was plodding home from a neighbouring farm, where he had been sent for to put the boiler right. To his surprise he overtook Jael at the top of the village. \" I never expected to see you out again so soon,\" he said. \" And you don't look fit for it now.\" \" I ain't fit. Nor I don't think I shall be fitter. But I don't like to think o' the school missus bein' put about because of me.

Jonathan said nothing. They reached the little gate that led up a narrow gravel Avalk to the forge. A tiny approach it Avas, not four feet long and hardly two feet wide.

The Red Inn and the school-house stood on the opposite side of the road. So it was a safe place for Jael to speak, and Avhen she was with Jonathan her usual reserve broke down. The burden that lay at her heart could only be eased now by speaking to him. She shoAved this so plainly that he never had the heart to divert her from the subject. And now, though it pained him, he Avanted to hear her speak. \" He's al'ays a-comin' and a-goin'. He's arter the missus sure enough. And to think as she that's so good and comely is to be matched along of him \u2014 it goes agin me that much, Jonathan, I hardly know how to keep my tongue.

When she had finished speaking she rose and stooped to pick it up. It was then, when Jonathan bent to get it for her, that he noticed for the first time that the door that he had locked was open. Some one had rifled the shop, was his first thought. The last stroke of ill-luck had fallen. He pushed open the crazy door, and saw no thief, but Andrew, with his mouth and eyes open, leaning forward upon the bench, his eyes red from sleep, and his hair ruffled, but his attitude that of earnest attention.

Andrew sat on, staring at her, and still silent. \" Don't look at me like that \u2014 don't, 'Drew, it's more than I can bear !\" she cried, half sobbing, as she untied the faded strings of her bonnet that seemed as if they must choke her. \" I did it for the best, I did ; I couldn't 'a told you \u2014 Jonathan there, he knoAvs I couldn't.\" Andrew drew a long breath, and then he said, \" You lied to me, Jael.

The expression on Jonathan's face was one that his mate had never seen since he had left Hepreth Hos pital. He was not sure that even there he had seen its equal. He tried to turn the subject.

It seemed to Jael as it Avould have seemed to the other villagers, that this was the most natural occupation for a school mistress. Indeed Daphne had become amanuensis to many of the Shelbourne folk, her neighbours.

That evening after the school-feast, as they Avalked through the shrubbery at the Place, Aaron Falk had asked her to be his Avife. Jonathan had guessed rightly in that, but in one thing (and that a very vital point) he had jumped too hastily to a conclusion. Miss Lynn had not accepted the breAver's offer. But neither had she refused it. Her mind was unsettled. She liked Aaron Falk, and she was flattered by his devotion. She felt that in wishing to make her his Avife he must be acting with complete disinterest edness. Everything pointed unmistakably to the fact that what would be a good mar riage for her would be a very poor one for him. She esteemed him as an honourable man, Avho was acting honourably and gene rously toAvards her.

And in accepting it, she Avould be taking a step that Avould please Mrs. Lynn as nothing else could. Long since she had set her heart upon it. Long since she had taken the line of appearing to believe no other issue Avas possible. It had pained Daphne at first, but little by little, as the course of things began to run more smoothly, the mother became more silent and dis creet, (\" leaving AveU alone,\" as she and Mrs. Myse Avhispered together \u2014 ) and the daughter more reconciled to the possi bility.

She did not feel it even after the declaration of his love. But she said to herself that it Avas not in her nature to love passionately. She was born for the ports and calms of life. And hoAV many people made shipAvreck of their passionate loves, after all ! And Aaron Falk was so much older than she was, there must natu rally be a large preponderance of respect in her feelings towards him. Boys and girls fell in love in random foolish fashions. But she, the schoolmistress, twenty-four years of age, and Avooed by a man no longer young (in her eyes at least), must not go in for such follies. She had no past story to tell her what"], [184, "176 JONATHAN. love might be, she Avas not as yet tempted by its sweetness to forego everything for it. And yet she could not give Aaron Falk an answer when he asked her to marry him, in the shrubbery-Avalk. She told him the plain truth \u2014 that her mind Avas not made up, that the step Avas too momentous to be taken hurriedly, before she was sure Avhether they could be happy or not. \" Happy?' he had repeated after her, and the tone of fervour and of pain in his voice frightened her. His confidence, his eager ness, were such a contrast to her cold uncer tain frame of mind, to her composed, chilly sentences. If he expected her to respond in all their intensity to these feelings, she had better refuse him at once. She told him so ; but he was touchinoly humble, touchingly content to wait. To hear she had not any feeling of repugnance to him was a relief; to hear he might hope, had made \"all the difference in his life.\""], [185, "\"IS IT AY, OR NO?\" 177 And for ten days she had been commu ning Avith herself about the answer. To night, she had told herself, it must be given ; her mother had been telling her so for nine days past. But before she wrote it she forced herself to look honestly, as she thought, into her own heart. There were no secrets there ; but were there any leanings ? Could she ever repent afterwards if she married Aaron Falk ? Could she say, \" I have known nobler men than him ?\" She answered that she did not knoAv enough of Mr. Falk to decide this utterly. But all lovers must leave something to the future, something for experience to decide. The lover could not quite show what the husband would be, nor the woman that is being wooed, the wife.

And that when she accepted him she would make no shoAv of a depth of feeling of which she was innocent, Avas quite as certain. In the evening she sat down to Avrite her letter. \" Dear Sir,\" she began. It Avas hardly the way to address an accepted lover.

A figure was moving about in the garden. Daphne strained her eyes to see if it were her betrothed. But no, it was a man in his shirt sleeves, trimming the edges of the grass along the Avalks. She could not help a flush of pleasure, knowing it Avould be all hers. The com fort, the ease, the pretty home-like house, above all the garden \u2014 it took her breath away to think of it. No more toiling over books and slates all day ; freedom to do as she hked, and money to spend on Avhat she liked. To have her mother with her, and to make her last days happy ; and above all, to be a mother to the parish like Mrs. Myse, wine to give to sick people, milk and dinners to little Lily, help of all sorts to Josiah Thorne and Jael ; the tears came into her eyes thinking of it all. She felt"], [194, "186 JONATHAN. she hardly deserved to be the possessor of so many things she cared for. And then she blushed, thinking Iioav she had come out that morning to escape meet ing the man Avho Avas to give it all to her, the man she must promise to love, honour, and obey. And so she Avould, she said to herself. She would try to make him very happy ; she had made him happy indeed already, by giving him her promise. All the rest, all the right and natural , feelings Avould come in time. Josiah Thome's eyes brightened as he turned his head on the pilloAv to Avelcome her. \" You been a long time a-comin' to see me,\" he said feebly. \" I didn't think never to see 'e no more agin.\" \" Oh, don't say that !\" said Daphne ; \" I hope you will see me many times yet.\" And she thought that next time she"], [195, "COUNTING THE COST. 187 came she might have a basket of fresh eggs, a bottle of port wine, and a bunch of grapes to bring Avith her.

But Miss Lynn's curiosity was aroused. She must hear all she could noAv about Aaron Falk, since she was trusting her happiness to him. \" What have you to do Avith him ?\" she asked, looking at Jael and the old man in turn. \" Nothin' !\" said Jael, hastily. \" He's our landlord, that's all.

If Aaron Falk had not told her the exact truth, or had not appeared to do so, she Avas the last person that must betray him. Jael gave a hasty shrug. \" He said a deal, I warrant,\" she an svvered, sulkily as Daphne thought. \" Say in's easy.\" Daphne felt a something between a short breath and a sigh rising, and stopped it. \" Let me read to you, Thorne,\" she said, and she took down the old dusty Bible. She thought it Avould soothe her, as it ahvays did, as she saAV it soothed the old man who had got \" into the valley.\" But the Psalm she fell upon at hazard Avas in the key of her OAvn thoughts : \"Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? avIio shall dAvell in Thy holy hill ? \"He that Avalketh uprightly, and worketh"], [198, "JONATHAN. 190 righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.\" It Avas a small matter \u2014 a very small mat ter \u2014 that Aaron Falk should have equivo cated Avhen she had asked him whether the miserable tumble-down cabin were his.

But Avhat Avas to explain the evasion from the truth, of Avhich she herself Avas certain? Suppose he Avere not utterly noble, then, after all ? Suppose there were, after all, nobler men than he ? Her thoughts still came in the Bible lan guage she had so lately used at Josiah Thome's bedside.

Daphne noticed that his countenance looked a shade less radiant, and with the faint suspicion of some injustice or hard dealing to Jael and her father in her mind, she was wide awake to everything that might throw a hght upon the subject. If there was anything to be known discreditable to the man she was about to marry, she had better know it at once.

She had told him she could not marry yet ; that she must consult Mr. May and Mrs. Myse first ; that time must be given them to find a new schoolmistress. And to this resolve she remained firm. Two or three months' time she must have. And yet Aaron Falk Avent home in a glory of sunlight, loving so much himself, that he thought he was loved more. And after this things Avent smoothly on.

But he changed his Avork, and his employer, and walked three miles out of Shelbourne every day, that he might avoid coming upon Aaron Falk. He loathed him so that he would have gone farther than that to escape a meeting with him. If he met him, he could not tell Avhat the conse quences might be. He never spoke of him to Jonathan ; but they both kneAv, like their neighbours, that Miss Lynn was going to marry the brewer. Sometimes the two young men Avould see them Avalking through the fields in the September evenings ; and both, with one consent, would change their course, to avoid them. \" It seems Aveve got nothing to do Avith folk that are happy, you and I, 'Drew,\""], [206, "JONATHAN. 198 said Jonathan once, when they had thus avoided the lovers ; \" our lives don't seem to fall that way.\" His voice had a half-defiant, half-miser able tone. \" No, nor yet with folks that are bad, I hope,\" his mate answered, in a tone more defiant, if less miserable.

Mr. Falk, calling one morning Avith a message for Miss Lynn, and a hope of seeing her before school hours, was told by her mother that she was not at home ; that she had been called to the Thornes' cottage the evening before, and had no doubt spent the night there. A labourer had come to say that, passing by the end of the lane, he had \u2022seen a red handkerchief tied to a stick out of one of the windows. Thinking something was amiss, he went to the door.

The village itself was alive now with the tramp of labourers' feet, the opening and shutting of the doors as they came out, and the Avhistle of the younger men, on whom life's burden sat lightly.

The sound did not reach her dull ears, and it was a heavy footstep from behind the house that came at the summons.

It had never been her mis fortune to care for those who did not A*alue her friendship ; she had never been more than friendly, to use the strongest word, to Jonathan Cleare. And as she stood at the door, and heard his footsteps coming round the corner, she drew herself up, and said to herself that as the promised wife of Aaron Falk, she need feel no false modesty with other men. Of late she had not been to see Mr. Cleare ; but noAv it Avas AveU she should make friends Avith aU the village people ; it might be in her power to do them all in turn some service. \" I come with a message from Jael Thorne,\" she said to Jonathan ; \" the old man is very ill, and Jael is very anxious to see her daughter ; I think her name is Priscilla, and she is in the workhouse ; do you know her ?\""], [216, "208 JONATHAN. \" Yes, I know her,\" said Jonathan, \" and I suppose Jael wants her to come out ?\" \" Yes : she said you Avould go for her, if you knew she was in trouble.

Driven betAveen two fears, the fear of being compelled to meet Aaron Falk, and the pain of going again through the sufferings of yesterday, it seemed to her the last Avas the least evil of the two. The terrible truth she had faced already ; him she need not face. Nay, noAv that she had accepted the truth in all its bitterness, she was conscious"], [265, "FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH. 257 of a half-frenzied wish that it should be confirmed. The miserable alternations of her mind Avere unendurable. One moment she said to herself it coidd not be, she could not have been so deceived in him. The next moment, a rush of memories over whelmed her, and she could as little doubt that it was all too true. One moment she asked herself if she had wronged him, if it was all a terrible dream ? The next, she fled on faster towards Jael's home, all to escape from a terrible reality. And Jael would need her now, she said to herself, trying to drown her own troubles in the thought of another's. She might be of some comfort, at that sad time when strange hands took away her dead out of her sight. She walked slower and tried to calm her self.

She turned to the orchard, but there was no movement there. The house, too, Avas silent. Jael must be sleeping, then, and Pris cilla, and the child. Daphne's first thought was to let her sleep on. She must be so tired after long nights of watching and grief. The next was to remember that before long the old man must be laid in his coffin. It would be better for Jael to awake now, than to come to herself only to find her need to Avatch Avas over, and the time for the last look come. \" Jael !\" said Daphne, softly, at the bottom of the ladder. Perhaps she need not face them all, after all ; Jael was such a hght sleeper, she Avould hear her call. \" Jael !\" she said, the second time, less softly. There was no sound, though she strained"], [267, "FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH. 259 her ear to catch it. Not even a movement from Priscilla or the child. If they Avere sleeping soundly, she could go up and wake Jael, without awaking them. She began climbing the ladder carefully, groping her way for a safe footing on the dark landing. \" Jael !\" she said again, in the doorway, pausing as she looked into the room. Jael's bed Avas empty. 'Scilla was not there. Daphne gave a deep sigh of relief, see ing it. Then she felt a chiU steal over her. For there lay Jael sleeping beside the dead man ; all night she must have been alone with ihat. There was something thrUling and awful in the silence in the little garret ; in Jael's motionless child - like sleep beside the shrouded figure. 17\u20142"], [268, "260 JONATHAN. How brave she was, said Daphne, com ing nearer to her ; what a brave, true soul. \" Jael !\" she said, the fourth time ; and as she said it, and there came no answer, she stretched out her hand to touch the sleeper's shoulder. One touch, and Daphne withdrew her hand, while the chill that had stolen over her by reason of the silence, seemed to spread over her Avhole frame, and freeze her blood. This was not sleep : or if it be sleep, it is so different from that \" taking of rest in sleep \" that we knoAv nightly, that we have called it by another name. Jael Thorne was dead. The short, turbulent day of life was over ; and her rest had begun. Her work, too, was over : she lived to keep the last watch beside him, dead, whom, living, she had so long watched over.

This last shock seemed to rob her of aU her remaining strength. She found herself dizzy and faint, in the green lane, trying to make her way back to the village. After a few steps, a blackness came over her sight. She tried to get to a gate near her ; but the darkness thickened, and the"], [271, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 263 gate vanished from her. She tried no longer to save herself, but fell heavily to the ground. It is one of the many merciful provisions for our feeble human nature, that, Avhen suf fering, either of body or mind, reaches its highest point, then blessed unconsciousness overtakes us. There is a truce from pain, before we are called upon again to take up our burden. Pain's very intensity brings its own relief. How long Miss Lynn might have lain there it is difficult to say, for it was a lonely place \u2014 the loneliest in Shelbourne. But, this morning, the men who were carrying Josiah Thome's coffin came up the lane, and with them came Jonathan. He was walking with them, for he had a way of making friends with men of all trades, and picking up what he could from them. Perhaps that Avas the secret of his being able to turn his hand to most things."], [272, "264 JONATHAN. But the two men in front were the first to catch sight of a woman's figure stretched upon the ground. \" It must be Jael,\" said Jonathan, re membering her seizure the day of the school feast in Mr. May's field. He ran forAvard. The first glance shoAved him it Avas not Jael. Daphne's straw hat had fallen from her head and lay beside her. She lay with her face beneath the hedge, where the moss sloped up to it. It Avas the most death-like face Jonathan had ever seen in a living being. Was she living ? He could hardly think so \u2014 so deathly cold her hands Avere, and her hps so livid. Jonathan's mother had given him a little brandy in a small medicine-bottle. \" Jael '11 Avant something, poor soul,\" she had said, as she slipped it into his pocket ; \" and she's not like to have nothin' by her; not so much as a dust o' tea.\""], [273, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 265 He forced open the closed lips, and, raising her head on his knee, he poured it down her throat. \" She's so deadly cold,\" he said to the men, who had laid, down the coffin, and were standing staring, and doing nothing. \" Take that on to the house, AviU you, and get a blanket or a shawl.\" \" Here's this,\" said one ofthe men, throw ing something at Jonathan's feet, as he turned away. It was the parish pall : a rusty, thin, black velvet pall, with a wide white border. Jonathan put out his hand to take it. \" Not that, for the love of God,\" he said, under his breath ; and he pushed it from him with his foot, while he took his own coat off, and Avrapped it round her. StUl there was no movement in the head resting upon Jonathan's knee. Perhaps she was really dead. It seemed so long since he had found her ! and how"], [274, "JONATHAN. 266 long before he had found her might she not have been lying there ? Till noAv he had quite forgotten himself. In the Avish to save a life he had almost for gotten Avhose life he wished to save. Now that the thought came to him that the life Avas passed beyond his power to recall it, he knew it Avas Daphne Lynn that lay dead at his feet. And the first feeling Avas one \u2014 not of sick despair, but \u2014 of a strange triumph. Living, she Avas dead to him ; noAv she was his for one short moment. Aaron Falk had not found her, and tried to save her. God had taken her from them both, but to him, Jonathan, it had been given to know it first, to hold her while her spirit passed aAvay into God's presence. He laid her doAvn upon the grass again, his coat folded round her. And noAv he knelt beside her, and said Avords to her that he had never said to Daphne living."], [275, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 267 Every now and then he chafed her Avhite hands as a last hope. But then he laid them down again reverently on her breast. She had never meant that hand to be his ; it seemed to him a mean thing to take ad vantage of her now : only, he said, she could not hear him. \" You thought he loved you, and he must love you. God made you so that Ave must all love you. But his love was never like mine \u2014 he never could have made you as happy as I could. I'm poor and he's rich ; I was below you, and he was above you ; but I know you couldn't be happy Avith him, that's why God has taken you : I thought, somehow, it could never be \u2014 I thought it never could be right that the Almighty should let it be.\" There was a slight movement, first in the hands ; then the lips parted ; at last the eyes opened. Jonathan had risen to his feet, and was"], [276, "268 JONATHAN. standing a little on one side. It would be a shock to her to come to herself and find him so close to her ; his face would not be the face she Avould look for and hope to find. Ah, yes ! it was a shock, even now, and Daphne was straining her eyes to see him. Consciousness was only slowly coming to her. She had a perplexed wistful look on her face, she Avanted to see clearly, and could not. Catching sight at last of the outline of a man's figure, she gave a cry. It seemed to Jonathan to be a cry of terror. It gave him a sharp pain at his heart. He kneAv she would not care to see him ; but he had not thought that the sight of him Avould have been terrible to her. What had he done to deserve this ? At any rate she w*as frightened, and he must try to soothe her. \" Don't be afraid,\" he said, coming for-"], [277, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 269 ward, and looking into her still half- vacant eyes ; \" it's only Jonathan the blacksmith. I found you fainting, and I tried to bring you to.\" The eyes were not vacant any longer; they Avere turned upon Jonathan. The knitted brows relaxed ; even a smUe came to Miss Lynn's lips. \" Oh !\" she said, drawing a deep breath, \" it's you ; I didn't think of that; I thought, I was afraid \" She stopped, and tried to raise herself. \" If you'd not mind taking my arm,\" said Jonathan, \" I could help you to Jael's house. It's close by ; I suppose you were going there ?\" Miss Lynn was looking round, bewildered, as if the lane and hedges and the clear sky could help her to remember where she was, and what had happened. At the mention of Jael's name she re membered everything."], [278, "JONATHAN. 270 \" Not going,\" she said, \" I was coming back. I Avent up to see her, and she was \u2014 oh, Jonathan, she was dead !\" She burst into a flood of tears ; Jona than's arm shook under her hand. He had never heard his name from her lips before. Trouble had broken dovvn the barrier betAveen them. They Avalked on in silence a little, to- Avards the cottage. Then Miss Lynn said- \u2014 \" You must wonder at me for being so Aveak as to cry like this. I wonder at my self, because I know we must all die ; I do not think death is so very awful. But I Avas not well Avhen I came out ; I felt very ill and tired. I've had trouble of my OAvn, and Jael's came at the same time as mine ; and then finding her dead \u2014 it seemed the last straw, and I couldn't bear it any longer.\" Jonathan did not answer. He was won dering Avhat her trouble could be. All the"], [279, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 271 people thought she had no trouble, that all things prospered with her. He had thought so too. \" Our lots lie far apart,\" he said, after a Avhile. \" It isn't likely I can help you in anything; but if I can, you knoAV you've only to ask me. After this next ten days, I don't say I can, because if you're above me noAv, you'll be higher above me then, and Avhat's more \u2014 \" \" Don't speak of that !\" she cried, stop ping his words ; \" that is never to be.\" Jonathan was thunder - struck. Had Aaron Falk given her up ? Was it pos sible ? There was such infinite distress in her eyes, that he asked, in spite of himself, and with a touch of satire he was hardly con scious of \u2014 \" Is that your trouble \u2014 that it's never to be?\" \" It's trouble every way,\" she answered,"], [280, "272 JONATHAN. \" but that it should ever be, now, would be the worst trouble of all.\" They had come to the door ofthe cottage. Miss Lynn shivered as she saw that they had clone so. \" That house !\" Jonathan heard her say to herself, under her breath. \" Don't come in again,\" he said, \" there's no call for you to come in.\" His voice Avas trembling. He pointed to a broken stump by the wall, Avhere she could rest, and ran into the house to get away from his own tumultuous thoughts. Had the sin found out Aaron Falk, after all ? Was God going to do justly, by man's ideas of justice ? \" We couldn't get no blanket,\" said one of the men coming to meet him. \" There's nothing in the house but the clothes they lies in. I suppose the woman, she's asleep.\" Jonathan went up to the garret. Perhaps Daphne had been mistaken."], [281, "THE LANE THAT HAD A TURNING. 273 But Daphne had been right.

Too late to go and see Daphne that night ; the only light that burnt was from her bedroom window. But he was in a happy state of mind for all that ; happiness was so near to him now, it coloured his life already with its rosy glow."], [283, "THE BREWER'S RETURN. 275 Good wishes and congratulations had met him on all sides during the day. Many of his friends had heard of Miss Lynn, of her beautiful 'voice when she led the choir, of the change in Shelbourne since she had come there. They did not fail to teU him so, and hearing it all made him proud as weU as happy. He loved Daphne so well that the opinion of others would never have turned him from his choice ; but that his choice should be approved, was very plea- sant to him. He shrank from public cen- sure, and valued highly, if he did not court, pubhc praise. As he pulled off his great-coat inside his own door, he felt in the pocket for a little parcel he had brought with him. The lights were burning in the dining room, where Sarah had prepared his supper. She had lighted a fire, because it was a chilly evening, and the warmth and bright ness were in tune with his happy thoughts. 18\u20142"], [284, "276 JONATHAN. He went up to the table, undoing the silver paper round his little parcel. First, a something flat and small. He 7 __. laid it doAvn very carefully on the table, then opened the paper and its contents. It Avas a wedding ring, small and bright, that lay shining under the lamp-light. He lifted up the little paper by the corners, as carefully as he had laid it down, and looked at it closely. A quiet smUe came over his face. The pinched, calculating, hard look was gone ; love and happiness had worked Avonders there. Then he laid the paper and the ring down again, and opened a tiny box. He took out of it a locket which he held up by the ring to the lamp-light. He was not used to handling such tilings, and he touched it gingerly, as if it would break. There Avas a lock of dark hair in the locket, when he opened it. He looked at the hair a moment, as if the thought that that should be in a locket"], [285, "THE BREWERS RETURN. 277 that Daphne was to wear pleased him greatly. When he heard Sarah's step, he closed it with a click, and took both ring and locket to the mantelpiece, where she could not see them. Two letters were lying on it ; one was unstamped, and the writing Avas Daphne Lynn's. Why did she Avrite, Avhen she could send for him ? Why had he not stopped to see if she wanted anything, as he passed the gate ? It was an unusual thing for her to AArite to him. Perhaps Mrs. Lynn was ill ; perhaps \u2014 he fancied the Avriting Avas hardly so firm as usual \u2014 perhaps Daphne herself was ill. He opened the envelope hastily. Sarah had left the room, shutting the door behind her. There was perfect stillness Avhile he read. Only the newly-lit fire crackled cheerfully at his feet."], [286, "278 JONATHAN. And he made no movement. He read to the end, folded the letter, put it back in the envelope, and laid it doAvn before him. But the thin face he raised to the ceding was blanched to a strong whiteness. The fresh night-wind had sent him in with a ruddy colour in his cheeks. Now the ghost of the man that had entered the room a few moments before stood in his place. Sarah's step was at the doorway once more. He turned aAvay to the fire again, and took up the paper. \" You can go to bed,\" he said, \" I want nothing more to-night.\" He sat down, and began mechanically carving the cold mutton on the table. But he stopped after the first slice had been cut, and laid down the knife and fork on either side. He put his hand up over his eyes, leaning his elbow on the table."], [287, "THE BREWER'S RETURN. 279 So he remained, far on into the night \u2014 that night that seemed to be ruled over by the evil influence of some star that sat high in the windy September sky, and looked down on Shelbourne. He had been stunned at first by the awful suddenness of the blow. Even thought was impossible. Now, as he sat on, and the hours clanged out in the silence from the steeple, he came to himself; and asked himself what he should do ? Do ? what was there to do ? Doing was of as little avail as thinking. Once before, in terrible trouble, he had roused himself to act, and he had acted. But what had the act done for him ? It had averted the blow that had fallen at last. If it had taken place then, it would have been less hard a blow. Then he had never known or loved a Daphne. The respect of"], [288, "280 JONATHAN. his neighbours had been hard to lose ; Avhat was it to lose this Avoman's love, after he had earned it \u2014 just as the cup of happiness Avas at his lips ? What could he do ? With her nothing could be done ; that was all over. Fear of him, suspicion of him, he might have over come ; but she had learnt a terrible truth ; it Avas the strength of that, that stunned him. With her there could be no buy ing over, no deceiving. She was true, and he loved her : there could be no crooked dealing's with her. He did not Avonder how the truth had come to her ; hoAV, after all, the sin had found him out. That it had come to her, that he had lost her, and through his own sin, that was the sting of his sorrow. Through Jonathan or through Jael, Avhat did it matter, so long as he had lost her ?

In proportion as he had fallen low before her, so she towered above him. They could have nothing in common. She could have no pity for him : repentance could be but an idle word in her ears ; for how could repentance undo the past, and make him the man she had be lieved in ? Wi thjher nothing could be done, and little said. His shame Avould have driven him aAvay Avithout seeing her, and so he could have spared her pain.

Her forgiveness he must gain, if he could : for he knew by the letter before him what she had suffered \u2014 Avhat he had caused her to suffer. He rose from his untasted supper, and took the little box in his hands. Then he pushed open the window, an dAvalked down the green slope of his garden, to the pond below. There was a little plash, not enough to startle the swan asleep on the water, Avith his head under his Aving. One or two small circles, that the moon lighted up as a cloud, passed by her. Aaron Falk came back. The little plain gold ring lay still upon the mantelpiece in its silver-paper. He had measured her finger for it. It only went upon the tip of his own.

Why should she let him tliink she cared Avhether he walked Avith her or not ? They started together, and both were silent. Only her light tread and his heavy one beat time together. Jonathan's heart Avas full. Her words had stung him. \" I knoAv you don't care,\" he said. \" I never thought you did. What can it matter to you Avhether I \" She had looked up at him with anxious, Avondering eyes.

But that Jonathan should love her \u2014 it made her heart beat. It beat louder, thinking, perhaps, she was mistaken ; that he would say nothing more, but begin talking of com mon things, as he had always done before. Perhaps Jonathan saw some new light in her eyes as these thoughts passed through her mind. And yet he did not speak. He Avas looking at her, hanging upon her next word. It was madness, this that he was on the verge of doing ; and yet if she said one kind word, gaA'e him one kinder look, he knew nothing could prevent his speak ing.

And why should I ?\" \" Cared !\" he said, \" you never thought I cared ?

Jonathan looked up into the June sky, and back into the copses, and on to the vil lage, and then at Daphne walking by his side. Was it all true ? Did she really love him ?
