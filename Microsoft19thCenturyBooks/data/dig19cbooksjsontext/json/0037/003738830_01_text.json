I did not visit Morocco or Spain on any settled plan. I was on my way to Italy by sea, and passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, was so fascinated by the beauty and mysteries of the adjoining lands, that I relinquished my proposed excursion for the explora tions which are here recorded. Barbary, to the attraction of the unknown and the original, which it shares in common with China and Japan, adds that of association with the country which, of all others, has a claim on our affections \u2014 Canaan. With Barbary also is interwoven the history of various races, great, ancient, and mysterious : the Canaanite, the Hebrew, the Highland Celt, and the Saracen. It has become the last refuge of the Philistine. The Jews, in other countries, by adopting the habits of strangers, have lost their type, which is to be seen alone in Barbary, where Jud\u00e6a, effaced in Asia, doubly survives. Here must we seek the Uving interpretation of the Scriptures ; here may we find insight into early things. The connexion of the Scotch clans with Barbary depends on no ethnographic affinity, but their passage through, and sojourn in, this land, reveal the history of their wanderings, and explain the peculiarities of their race. Here are to be found to-day the people a2"], [12, "INTRODUCTION. IV who made Spain a garden, taught it at once the arts of war and peace ; and thence spread that knowledge to the rest of Europe. That stream which then over flowed, has retired to its fountain, where it lies deep, but not changed. Spain and Morocco present treasures unknown, in those regions which have been subject to repeoplings and fundamental changes. \" The life of nations,\" says Erchhoff, \" manifests itself in their language, which is the faithful representative of their vicissi tudes. Where chronology stops, and the thread of tradition is broken, the antique genealogy of words that have survived the ruin of empires comes in to shed light on the very cradle of humanity, and to consecrate the memory of generations long since engulfed in the quicksands of time.\" The unchanged tongue here gives additional force to that genealogy \u2014 here history is nearly mute. The same monumental character, however, belongs to manners, costume, and tradition. I have not, therefore, hesitated to devote considerable space to these inquiries, as, indeed, they constituted the chief attraction of the excursions, which seemed to be less through new countries than remote ages. I have to bespeak the reader's indulgence for inviting him often to accompany me with his atten tion through homely paths. I have brought him in presence of the most trivial practices. I have not described, as a stranger would, a different manner of life ; but endeavoured, as a native, to explain matters"], [13, "INTRODUCTION. V from which we might derive benefits in health, com fort, happiness, or taste, from their old experience. Wherever I have drawn comparisons, it has been for our advantage, not for theirs. It has, therefore, been their merits, not ours, that I have placed in evidence. I have no expectation that my suggestions will modify the lappet of a coat, or the leavening of a loaf; but there is one subject in which I am not without hope of having placed a profitable habit more within the chance of adoption than it has hitherto been \u2014 I mean the bath. Cleanliness, like inebriety or intemperance, may be at once a fashion and a passion. Appearing amongst us under both shapes, it has also assumed that of charity. As soon as it was felt that it was shameful to be dirty, it became a work of charity to wash the filthy, no less than to feed the hungry. These dispo sitions offer an opportunity of reviving the bath in all its classic grace, and investing it with all its Eastern attractions ; but the occasion may be lost \u2014 that is, we may rest satisfied with what we have done, and the new wash-houses may pass current as achieve ments of economy and models of cleanliness. The occasion can be put to profit only by the knowledge of the bath in its bearings on the individual and on society ; and I have made the attempt to describe it, so that it shall be understood in its uses, enjoyments, and construction. We have recently been imitating barbarous times in church architecture. These times offer to our"], [14, "VI INTRODUCTION. admiration usages as well as forms. Shall we have eyes for a Gothic spire, and none for a Roman bath \\ Nations may have refinement, and yet be destitute of common sense ; they may be possessed of sense, a&d yet be without refinement. A people without the bath can lay claim to neither. Morocco calls attention to the past ; Spain directs it to the future. We pass from dreams to delusions, from poetry to politics. Belgium has been termed the battle-field of Europe \u2014 Spain is its bone of contention. The Italian Peninsula is the field of the rivalries of France and Austria, which England balances and adjusts. In the East, England and France are united by the advance of Russia ; in the Spanish Peninsula they are alone in presence of each other : the aim of each is to gain ascendancy, and thence a constant source of irritation. The political experiment which is at present being made in Spain, consists in applying European terms to a country where there are no European ideas, and European institutions to a state of things wholly unlike Europe. The following fragment of a conver sation with a leading statesman conveys that contrast in the fewest words. Spaniard. \u2014 I am sorry that you see Spain in such a distracted condition.

There are lowly vales and verdant plains, as well as gigantic moun tains. This great, this beautiful country \u2014 this corner of a mighty continent \u2014 almost touches Europe. One half of our whole trade passes along it ; yet it is sealed against us more effectually than China or Japan. European enterprize, by lust of conquest, love of gain, or spirit of proselytism, has made the wide world its vineyard ; and, combining its various engines, has, far and near, shattered thrones, and subjugated or extinguished races. How is it that Morocco stands unmoved and unassailed ? All the nations which formed part of the Roman Empire, and have become Mussulmans, have fallen under the sway of Constantinople, Morocco alone ex cepted. All the barbarous States, which have attracted the cupidity of Europeans, have fallen under their sway, Morocco alone excepted.

It is an old story, and we have forgotten it, that on Morocco our first and greatest essays of conquest were made. England expended upon the fortification of Tangier more than all she ever advanced for the conquest of India. Portugal and Spain, who had found it necessary to separate, by half the globe, their other enterprizes, here combined, and expended more lives, ships, and treasure in their fruitless attempts than in the subjugation of the East Indies and the West.

It was then that a family of mendicants and fanatics issued like lions from the desert, upset the ruling dynasties, re-kindled the flame of patriotism, rallied the sink ing people, drove forth the invaders, constructed a common Empire out of these divided States, and placed their Dynasty upon the throne, which it oc cupies to this day. From that time only have Europe and Africa be come strangers to each other ; and so Morocco has maintained the independence so strangely won. What renders this non-intercourse surprising is neighbourhood ; yet that is its explanation. Here Europeans could not be taken for Children of the Sun, nor supposed to be quiet traders seeking only commerce : the watchfulness of this people was not, as in India, overreached, nor their affections, as in America, surprised.

THE CURRENTS OF THE STRAITS. The Mediterranean is like a bag with two necks filling at both ends. The current through the Dar- danelles presents exciting varieties, but no perplexing mysteries. It is the discharge of the surplus of the Black Sea, and the current is subject to the influences of the northerly and southerly winds ; being reversed when the latter long prevails. At Gibraltar all is disorder \u2014 the stream incessant \u2014 the level on both sides the same. The tide rises and falls, yet the current always runs out of the ocean and into the Mediterranean. So determined is this rush, that the gales of the Equinox neither quicken nor retard it, and the _ phases of the moon have no power over it. It bursts through all obstacles and transgresses all laws, and seems to move by a will of its own \u2014 too strong to be disturbed, too deep to be discovered. During my excursions I was engaged in examining these phenomena, and I will commence with stating the results of several months' cogitation and inquiries. I first applied myself to test the old explanation of an under-current, by endeavouring to float sub-"], [42, "22 THEORY OF stances at various levels, and after great trouble in procuring lines, and having machines of various kinds made, I found that without a frigate's tackle and crew no results could be obtained. I was thus re duced to mere scrutiny of the alleged facts, and of the alleged theory. The facts amount to this : a vessel, in 1 754, * was fired into from the battery, it sank in face of the rock, and was afterwards cast up in the bay of Tangier. A vessel, when it sinks, goes to the bottom, and if fragments of it are detached and are cast ashore, it is only because they float, that is, they rise to the surface. This story will not, therefore, serve the theory, even if authentic. There is nothing to pre vent a ship or timber from floating out ; for close in shore, on both sides, the tides of the ocean rise within the Straits to the height of four feet : of these, boats take advantage to get through against both wind and current. Sometimes, indeed, though it very rarely happens, the whole current is reversed ; and vessels working during the night, and reckon ing on being carried fifty miles to the eastward, have found themselves in the morning ninety miles to the westward of the point where they expected to be, that is to say, carried forty miles over the ground to the westward during the night, f Having thus disposed of the only, but incessantly quoted fact, I proceed to the theory.

It cannot go to the Black Sea, from which the Medi terranean receives water ; it cannot escape by a sub terranean passage into the Red Sea, for the level of the Red Sea is higher by thirty feet. Then there is an under-current discharging the water back again into the ocean.\" Water moves by its weight. Unless there is dif ference of level, there is no motion. The resistance is from the bottom according to its roughness, and the vis inerti\u0153 is felt at the top \u2014 thus the greatest speed is at about two-thirds of the depth \u2022 here there is no difference of level, nor is the water acted on superficially by any propelling power. There is no prevalence of winds to account for a current at the surface. So great is the momentum of the- stream, that, unlike the currents of the Dardanelles, it is neither accelerated by favourable winds, nor even retarded by adverse storms. The idea of an over current running against an under-current is so op posed to all experience, that to be admissible, proofs would be required, and it could never be received as an hypothesis to account for an unexplained phenomenon. Thus, the theoretical explanations utterly fail ; yet there is action without agent, momentum without motor, currents without winds or declivity, and a vessel constantly filling without escape or overflow. A mighty river rushes over its bed ; but this river"], [44, "24 SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. is not moved by its weight ; it runs on a dead level* to the sea it reaches from the fountain whence it springs. \u2014 That fountain is the ocean itself ! No won der that this should be the first of ancient mysteries, and the last to be explained. Before I had discarded the idea of an under-current, or had discovered the insufficiency of the evaporation to account for the indraught, I was sitting on Partridge Island, (a small rock within the Straits,) and gazing with astonishment at the enormous mass of water running by me, when the question occurred to me, what becomes of the salts If the water evaporate, the salt remains ; here then is the sluice of a mighty salt-pan \u2014 -where is the produce % This has been going on for thousands of years ; is there a deposit of salt at the bottom ? If so, why have the abysses of the Mediterranean not been filled up 1 But salt is not deposited ; how then is the Mediterranean not become brine 1 Then I saw that the evaporation would not account for the indraught, and before I descended from that rock, I had solved the problem. That solu tion is \u2014 an under-current produced by a difference of specific gravity between the water of the Mediter ranean and the ocean. If you take two vessels, and fill one with fresh water, and the other with salt, or the one with sea- * The excellent geodesic operations of Corab\u0153uf and Deleros have shown, that at the two extremities of the Pyren\u00e6an chain, as well as at Marseilles and the northern coast of Holland, there is no sensible difference between the level of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. \u2014 Cosmos, vol. i. p. 297."], [45, "HUMBOLDT ON CURRENTS. 25 water at its ordinary charge of 1030, and the other with sea-water of higher specific gravity, such as would result from evaporating a portion of it, say 1100, and colour differently the water in the two vessels, and then raise a sluice between them, you will instantly have two currents established in opposite directions. In fact, you produce currents of water, like currents of wind, by the converse of rarefaction. \" Recent discoveries,\" says Humboldt, \" have shown that the ocean has its currents exactly as the air. Living, as we do, upon the surface, they have been beyond our reach ; but now, having obtained soundings to the depth of four miles, we have ascertained that there is a rush of icy water from the Pole to the Equa tor, just as there is a draft of air close to the earth into the centre of Africa. The Mediterranean offers an apparent anomaly of a higher temperature at great depths. This Arago explains by the fact, ' That the surface of the water flows in as a Westerly current, whilst a counter current prevails beneath, and prevents the influx from the ocean of the cold current from the Pole.'* If there was nothing to determine the cur rents at the entrance of the Mediterranean, save the relative degrees of cold at great depths between it and the ocean, the cold water would run in at the lowest depths, and the warm water would run out on the surface, which is precisely the reverse of what it does. Here is a body of water 740,000 square miles in * Cosmos, vol. i. p. 296."], [46, "26 THE WATER IN extent, subject hourly to the increase of its specific gravity. Upon the surface, a crust of salt is left in the course of every year, sufficient to give a double charge to the depth of six fathoms. To adjust the difference thus created with the ocean, there is but a narrow inlet, \u2014 a mere crack upon the side of the ves- sel, an interval of six miles left in a circumference of four thousand. By this, in its deepest part, the heavier water will have to find its way out, and thus occasion an indraught of water above, besides the demand created by evaporation. It remains to be ascertained by experiment, that the specific gravity of the water in the Straits varies at different levels, and at what level it commences to move outwards. These experi- ments will present great practical difficulties from the tides at the sides, which will mingle the streams ; and, from the shallowness towards the ocean, they must be made in the middle and at the Mediterranean side. The evaporation, and the differences of specific gravity, will give the means of calculating the amount of water passing through in both directions, and the depth and velocity of the two currents. But it may be inferred that the currents will have the greatest speed at the top and the bottom, \u2014 that their velocity will diminish towards the centre, and that a neutral space of dead water will remain, not only in consequence of the counter-impetus of the currents, but because of the nearer approach of specific gravity, and the mingling of the two waters, which would destroy the moving power."], [47, "THE STRAITS. 27 With this solution we can at once understand the powerlessness of tides and storms, currents without difference of level, or prevalence of winds : the volume of the stream is accounted for, the mass of salt dis posed of, and the apparent rebellion against the laws of Nature put down. By tables kept for several years at Malta, it appears that the Mediterranean, at that point, varies in level between winter and summer no less than three feet. In winter, when there is no evaporation, and when the quantity of water falling in the immediate vicinity of the Mediterranean is greatest, the level is lowest. The cause, I should take to be the pressure of wintry wind. In like manner, those erratic movements in the Straits may result from difference of atmospheric pressure without and within. These currents, by the testimony of the ancients, have not held from the beginning \u2014 they have been the results of successive modifications of the channel. This is singularly borne out by the traditions of the neighbouring people and the geological features of the coast. Eldressi narrates, as an old and popular story of his day, that \" the Sea of Cham, (Mediterranean) was in ancient times a lake surrounded on all sides, like the Sea of Tabaristan (Caspian), the waters of which have no communication with any other seas.

Then he ordered the earth to be dug out ; and they dug it away to the bottom of the mountains on both sides ; and he built there two terraces with stones and lime the whole length between the two seas, which was twelve miles ; one on the side of Tankhe (Tangier), and one on the side of Andeluz.

It then hum bled itself in the stomach of the gnats, and prayed to be relieved, so the gnats were ordered to vomit it forth again, but the salt remained from the stomach of the gnats an eternal sign of its disobedience.\" Before suggesting the interpretation of these Myths, I wils point out the change which the coasts and channel have undergone. The description of the Straits by Greek and Roman writers is so unlike their present appearance, that, but for the impossibility of doubting the identity of the objects, we must have supposed their words to apply to some undiscovered region. Who could recognize the deep sea and the iron-bound coasts of these nar rows, in a plain of sand furrowed by rivers running in from the ocean, which it was difficult to reach, not from the strength of the stream, but the intricacies of the passage \u2014 who would imagine the necessity of constructing flat-bottomed boats to get across from Gibraltar to Ceuta, where now there is above one thousand fathoms, or of transferring the ferry to the Atlantic side of the Straits, where at present the depth"], [50, "30 THE MEDITERRANEAN is not one-sixth of what it is in the other, in order to get more water \\ Yet there is no doubt that these details apply to these spots, nor can we question the known accuracy of the writers, or escape from the concurrence of their testimony. We are reduced, then, to the necessity, of admitting some great revolution in the features of the country, and a total change in the nature ofthe current. The explanation is easy : the bank of sand, left by the retiring waters of the Deluge, which covers the western border of Africa, reached to the coast of Andalusia, and the remnants of it still lie on the eastern side of Gibraltar, and fill the caverns exposed to that side ; on the depression of the Mediterranean by evaporation, the water of the ocean would filter in, the sand would be gradually removed. The amount of sand on the Mediterranean side of the \" Rock,\" shows that a plain nearly one thousand feet above the level of the sea, once stretched across to Africa, where now the channel is one thousand fathoms deep. This has been worked out by the overfall, while on the Atlantic side the water shoals to one hundred and eighty fathoms, presenting the character of an estuary with a bar from the rush outward of the under waters, since the Gut was sufficiently deepened to admit of the currents in opposite directions. The centre part of the channel is worn down to the rock or to gravel, every particle of sand has been removed from the bottom. Two inferences may be drawn : 1st. That the process of removal was likely to be accompanied by sudden"], [51, "IN EARLY AGES. 31 inbursts, which would submerge the borders. 2nd.

There is no place of which it is more difficult to form an idea without seeing it, than Gibraltar. One naturally expects to find a fortress closing the Medi terranean with its celebrated galleries and enormous guns facing the Straits. It is nothing of the kind. The Straits are, at the narrowest part, seven miles and a quarter wide ; but that part is fifteen miles from Gibraltar. It is only after you have passed the Narrows that you see the \" Rock \" away to the left. Ceuta, in like manner, recedes to the right; the width being here twelve miles. The current runs in the centre, sweeping vessels along, and instead of being exposed to inconvenience from either fortress, they would generally find it difficult to get under their guns. The batteries and galleries face Spain, and look landward, not seaward. Whatever its value in other respects, it is quite a mistake to suppose that it commands the Straits, or has ever had a gun mounted for that purpose. Gibraltar is a tongue three miles long and one broad, running out into the sea, pointing to Africa,"], [53, "33 THE ROCK. and joined to Spain at the northern extremity by a low isthmus of sand : it presents an almost per pendicular face to the Spanish coast. Seen from the \" Queen of Spain's Chair,\" it resembles a lion couching on the point, its head towards Spain, its tail towards Africa, as if it had cleared the Straits at a spring. Geologically speaking, it belongs to the African hills, which are limestone, and not to those of the opposite Spanish coast, which are crys talline. Mount Abyla is called by the Moors after Muza, who planned the expedition, and Calpe is now named after Taris, the leader who conducted it.

There are three elevations on the ridge, one in the centre, and one at each extremity. That in the centre is the highest ; and here is the signal station, from which works are carried straight down to the beach at the ragged staff.

The diagonal steps at the landing-places, the materials and the coating, as well as the whole aspect, show them to be Moorish. Heterodox as this opinion was held when I first broached it, it was not impugned after two inspections by the officers best qualified to pro nounce on such a matter."], [55, "GIBRALTAR. 35 On the north, too, all our defences are restorations of the Moorish works : even in the galleries they have been our forerunners. Their open works were in ad vance of ours, and a staircase is cut out through the Rock down to the beach. In fact, save in what is requisite for the application of gunpowder, or what is superfluous for defence, the Moors had rendered Gibraltar what it is to-day. They have even left us structures of the greatest service, as resisting the effects of gunpowder, and such as we are able neither to rival nor to imitate. On the great lines, in conse quence of the many changes which have taken place, the original work has been displaced, or covered up, and especially so along the sea-wall ; but, ascend to the signal-post, \u2014 crawl out on the face of the Rock to the north, \u2014 examine even yet Europa Point \u2014 Rozier Bay, and everywhere you find the Moor. It is impossible to move about at Gibraltar, without having the old tower in sight, and it is difficult to take one's eyes off it when it is so. No aspiring lines, no graceful sweeps, no columned terraces exert their fascination, nor is it ruin and dilapidation that speak to the heart. The building is plain in its aspect, mathematical in its forms, clean in its outlines, with a sturdy and stubborn middle-aged air, without a shade of fancy or of wildness. Nevertheless, the eye is drawn to it, and then your thoughts are fixed on it \u2014 and they are so, precisely because you cannot tell why. It constitutes the apex of a triangular fort, and D 2"], [56, "36 THE OLD TOWER. massy and lofty itself, it thus assumes a station of dignity and command. The annals of time are traced on it \u2014 here by the arrow-head still sticking,* there by the hollow of the shot and shell. It has borne the brunt of a score of sieges, and stands to-day without a single repair. On its summit, seventy feet from the ground, guns are planted. The terrace on the roof is cracked, but the surface is otherwise as smooth as if just finished. The pottery-pipes fitted in to carry away the water, are precisely such as might have been shipped from London. A semicircular arch supports a gallery on the inner side. A window opening in this gallery, now blocked up, is like a church window with the Gothic arch chamfered. The exterior was plastered in fine lime, and there are traces of its having been divided off into figures. It has now, by the barbarians in possession, been rubbed over with dirty brown to make it look ancient. The turrets on the walls below have been furbished up to look like cruet-stands, and the staring face of a clocks is stuck in a Saracen tower. The upper story only is explored and open ; the flooring is perfectly smooth, and the roof stuccoed. There is a bath-room, and a mosque ; the former has a figured aperture slanting through ten or twelve feet of wall to admit the light, as in the domes of Eastern baths. The other parts of the building are as much * The last one disappeared while I was at Gibraltar. t This Vandalism was gazetted, and the turret termed \" Stanley Tower.\""], [57, "37 THE MOORISH FORT. unknown as those of the unopened Pyramids. If these ruins had been in the hands of the tribe that live on the rock above, there would have been exhibited at least as much taste, and certainly more curiosity. The standing walls adjoining the towers exhibit faces of arches that covered in halls and surrounded courts. The second portion of the fort is at present used as a prison. The lower enclosure is of greater extent, and in the line of the wall is a remarkable Egyptian-looking building, square with buttresses at the angles and a pyramidal roof \u2014 roof and walls one mass of Moorish concrete (Tapia). It is as perfect as it was a thousand years ago, and may be equally so a thousand years hence. It is at present used as a powder-magazine, and is divided into two stories. The flooring of the upper hall is supported in the middle by a block of masonry some fifty feet square. This apartment is curiously ventilated. This Moorish fort is, as a whole, a building of great interest. An architect of the last century speaks of it as one of the most remarkable on the soil of Europe. It was no embellishment of, or defence for a capital ; it was raised in time of trouble on a remote promontory as a protection for insurgents. It was antecedent to art in Europe, \u2014 the people who raised it did not imitate Rome ; they must have brought this art with them. It stands a match for man and time, defying at once the inventions of the one and the ravages of the other."], [58, "38 THE MOORISH FORT AND TOWER. Here is an original in design and substance, a work surpassing those of the Romans in strength, and equalling those of the Egyptians in durability. As the zig-zag lines have been attributed to the Spaniards, so on high authority is a much more re cent date * than that which I here assign to them given to the Moorish fort and tower ; but supposing them to be of no earlier date than the fourteenth century, they would still illustrate a style of archi tecture which the Moors introduced, and which, like language, is lost in the mists of antiquity. They are now busy in demolishing the works that connected the Moorish fort with the harbour. Whilst tracing the old wall from the former to ihe latter, I came upon a large arch, and satisfied myself that this had been an entrance to an inner harbour. On subsequent reference to James's History of Gibraltar, I find that this was well known in his time. During these researches, in which I spent a month, I had not the aid that is generally obtained from the observations of others. I often attempted to look * Afterwards, at Madrid, Don P. Gayangos referred me to Ibn Batuta as fixing the date in the fourteenth century. On consult ing that traveller, I find that he spoke of repairs under Abn El Haran, who ascended the throne of Fez in 1330. An inscrip tion which existed in the last century, and of which a sac-simile is given in Col. James's History of Gibraltar, seems to fix the date at A.D. 750. The following is the passage from Ibn Batuta :\u2014 \" A despicable foe had bad possession of it for twenty years, until our lord the Sultan Abn El Haran reduced him ; he then re built and strengthened its fortifications and walls, and stored it with cavalry, treasure, and warlike machines.\""], [59, "DEFENCES OF THE ROCK. 39 into books, but was always constrained to throw them aside, and return to the writings on the wall. What manner of men were these Moors 1 \u2014 the ruins suggested the question, and books furnished no answer. On the sea-side, Gibraltar is open to the fire of ves sels, and would have been captured on one occasion, but for the dissensions between the combined forces. We have retained it only by a new invention, red hot shot. The land-entrance is defended as follows : first, the isthmus round the north face of the Rock is dug out and filled with water, and between this basin, called the Inundation, and the Bay, a causeway only is left, which can be swept away at once by the enormous guns from the overhanging caverns. Behind the Inun- dation, is the glacis, elaborately mined ; and behind the ditch there is a curtain, mounting eighteen or twenty guns, which fills up the gap between the Rock and the works on the port. As you advance along the narrow causeway between the Inundation and the Bay, you have this curtain in front. To the right stretches out into the water, a long low mole called the \" Devil's Tongue,\" and between it and the curtain, there is tier upon tier of embrasures over the Port and the Port entrance. To the left of the curtain, the sharp engineering lines scale the rocks, and link the chain of defence to the Moorish Tower. Thence the cliffs sweep away round to the left, parallel to the causeway, along which you are advancing. The Rock"], [60, "40 BOCCA DEL FUEGO. is shaved into lines for musketry, or pierced with port-holes, which stretch away in rows far and high. On the crest of the first precipice, batteries and guns are scattered. You see them again on the loftiest summit of the Rock, so that as you approach, you pass over ground swept with metal, and through suc cessive centres of converging fire. This is by the Spaniards called \" Bocca del Fuego.\" At each step, from all around, above, below, from Merlon, rock, and cavern, mouths of iron \u2014 some of them caverns themselves \u2014 open upon you. This is the only portion of the contour of the place that an assailant could approach or batter. With a sufficient garrison, and superiority at sea, so as to throw in provisions, the place is clearly impregnable. The breaching batteries would have to be advanced beyond the guns on the northern portion of the rock, and the advanced works would be looked into, and down upon. In no sieges had either breach been attempted, or third parallel drawn. The batteries on the crest of the Rock, termed Willis's, were the effec tual defence, by their plunging fire into the Spanish works. The siege, properly speaking, was an attempt to starve, by cutting off supplies at sea, and to break down by sheer superiority of fire and shelling. The operations from the sea would have been successful but for the red-hot shot. The vaunted galleries have been constructed since the siege, and are mere matters of ostentation. Gibraltar has neither dock nor harbour. The Bay"], [61, "41 THE GUNS OF ST. BARBARA. and anchorage are commanded by the Spanish forts, St. Barbara and St. Philip. These are levelled at present; but they will arise on the only occasion that we can require protection \u2014 that is to say, a war with Spain. They, therefore, must be restored in the mind's eye, if you would form any estimate of the value of this fortress in case of war. They were dis mantled during the late war by the Spanish govern ment, lest the French should occupy them, and destroy the English shipping. The Spanish government, how ever, formally reserved its right to rebuild them. The question has been lately raised by our sinking one of their men-of-war in their own waters, while pur suing a smuggler. The guns of St. Barbara command the anchorage and batter the harbour ; the shells from it and St. Philip pass clean over the Rock, lengthways, and can be dropped into every creek where a shoulder of rock might shelter a vessel from the direct fire. During the siege by France and Spain, the post was of no use. Unless when superior at sea, we had to sink our vessels to save them. In Gibraltar, there is little trade except contra band ; the natural commerce having been systemati cally discouraged, that the martial departments might not be troubled, and with the view of reducing it to a mere military establishment. The fiscal regulations of Spain, which sustain this traffic, would long since have fallen but for its retention by England. We, therefore, lose the legitimate trade of all Spain for"], [62, "42 CESSION OF GIBRALTAR the smuggling profits (which go to the Spaniards) at this port. Gibraltar does not command the Straits. It does not present means of repairs for the navy. It does not afford shelter for shipping in case of war. It does not advantage, but seriously incommodes our trade. It does not afford the means of invading or of overawing, or even in any way annoying Spain, however much it may irritate her ; for no fertile country, populous region, or wealthy city is exposed to it, and there is no highway by land or sea which it can command. William IIL, when he conspired for the partition of the Spanish monarchy, on the demise of Charles the Second, stipulated for Gibraltar, the ports of Mahon, and Oran, and a portion of Spain's transatlantic do minions. On the death of the last of the line of Philip Le Bel, Louis XIV. was bought off by the offer of the crown for his grandson. The English and the Dutch then set up Charles the Third, and sent a squa dron in his name to summon Gibraltar to surrender. The garrison consisted only of one hundred and ninety men ; but it held out. The Dutch and English bat tered, and took it. The flag of Charles the Third was hoisted, but suddenly hauled down and replaced by the English, to the surprise and indignation of our Dutch allies. Thus was revealed the secret condi tion of the compact. Gibraltar was all that England did get out of that war, and as this robbery went a great way to ensure"], [63, "43 TO THE ENGLISH. her discomfiture, and to establish Philip the Fifth upon the throne, we may consider Gibraltar as the cause of the first of those ruinous wars which, made without due authority, and carried on by anticipa tions of Revenue, have introduced among us those social diseases which have counterbalanced and per verted the mechanical advancement of modern times. Gibraltar was confirmed to us at the Treaty of Utrecht, but without any jurisdiction attached to it, and upon the condition that no smuggling should be carried on thence into Spain. These conditions we daily violate. We exercise jurisdiction by cannon shot in the Spanish waters (for the Bay is all Span ish). Under our batteries, the smuggler runs for protection ; he ships his bales at our quays; he is either the agent of our merchants, or is insured by them ; and the flag-post at the top of the Rock is used to signal to him the movements of the Spanish cruisers.\"\"\" We take it for granted that Gibraltar has been honourably, some will even say chivalrously, won in fair fight ; that it has been secured by treaty and is retained on duly observed conditions ; or, perhaps, we never trouble ourselves about such matters, and imagine, therefore, that other nations are equally in different ; but if any one of us would take the trouble to imagine the fortress of Dover in the possession of * When this was told to M.

The first item in the account is the Spanish War of Succession. From the consequences of that war and the retention of Gib raltar, the family compact of the Bourbons arose. The subsequent European wars are thus partly the cost-price of Gibraltar. This combined power weighed constantly against England and her fortune. If these effects were to be calculated in money, it would be by hundreds of millions. The actual outlay, however, is enormous. Gibraltar must have cost at least, 50,000,000/. f- If * Napoleon in captivity, being asked if he really had the intention of attacking Gibraltar, or the hope of getting pos session of it, answered, \" It was not my business to relieve England from such a possession.

I cannot speak of this place in any sense as English. I must recollect only and describe it as Moorish. To the Moors it owes its reputation and its strength ; and it had for them value. It was ac quired by them in a fair, open, stand-up fight. It was selected with judgment, fortified with skill, and de fended with valour. The reason why the place was of importance to the Moors was, that they were in vading Spain from Africa, and that, without the superiority at sea. We have had experience of Gibraltar for a century and a half : we have carried on great wars during that time, maritime and territorial combined. The Medi terranean, as much as the ocean, has been the field of our operations. Spain has been the arena of con test. In the history of time, there has been no series of events so calculated to bring out the value of this fortress, if it had any (except as above stated), yet what have we to show 1 \u2014 Merely a position which we have defended. We have never acted from it ; we have never invaded Spain by it ; we have never sup ported Spain through it ; we have never refitted at it. It has figured in war solely in consequence of opera tions against it, or by the necessity of accumulating and locking up there our resources for its protec tion."], [66, "46 VALUE OF GIBRALTAR The question of its value for England can only arise in the case of Spain being against us. Spain being with England, Gibraltar would be at our disposal as Ceuta was during the last war. In the hands of Spain no sane man would ever think of attacking it. When William III. fixed upon it, it was because he was seeking for something to cover his real purpose, which was to involve the nation in foreign wars. Gibraltar is the very point where it would be desirable for Spain that an invader should land. It is the apex of a rocky province, well defended and destitute of towns and subsistences. Without the command of the sea, you cannot attack Spain from the sea ; and having that command it is the plains of the Guadalquiver you would seek, the open entrances into Grenada and Valencia. It would be the towns of Malaga, Cadiz, and Barcelona \u2014 there the vital parts are exposed. The Carthaginians attacked Spain from Africa. The Romans, like the English, supported Spain ; at least, they began by doing so. Yet neither Cartha ginian nor Roman fixed upon Gibraltar. Scipio has told the whole story, and Livy has preserved his words, yet no one seems to have read them. They are of special value ; for the contest for Spain, and through Spain, for the world, was not so much between Rome and Carthage, as between two families, the Scipios and the Barcas. The passage I refer to, is in Scipio's speech to the soldiers before the walls of Carthagena, the spot where Spain was most vulnerable from"], [67, "47 TO SPAIN. Africa, and where Africa might be most heavily struck from Spain.* Had the Moors been able to do what the Cartha ginians did, they would not have fixed on this rock. Having been defeated at sea before the first invasion, they had to steal over by the nearest point. Gibraltar was their tete de pont across the Straits. Ceuta, their place of arms, was immediately opposite, yet, with all these propitious circumstances, Gibraltar came to be of importance only as commanding the Bay of Algesi ras, which they had made strong, though not natu rally so, by sheer building and fortification. Gibraltar now lives on its former credit. There are no Scipios or Hannibals now-a-days, nor even Napoleons or Walpoles.f We are now men learned in facts. Gibraltar being a place of great strength, it is assumed to be a place of great value, and we are perfectly con tent with having for the sake of it disturbed Europe, endured the abomination and the load of public debt, sullied our name, and squandered our treasure. And yet this cost would not be wholly vain, if the word \" Gibraltar,\" could but bring some of that blood to the cheek of the Englishman, which it causes to rush to the heart of the Spaniard. No doubt there is for * \" Potiemur pr\u00e6terea cum pulcherima opulentissima que urbe turn opportunissima, portu egregio unde terra manque qu\u00e6 belli usus poscunt suppeditentur * * H\u00e6c illis arx, hoc horreum, \u00e6ra (ium, armamentarium, hoc omnium rerum receptaculum est.

The Spaniard alone in Europe has retained the faculty of looking at a nation's acts as those of a man, and appreciating it thereby. He does not ask what it says or intends, or what\" food it eats, or how many servants it has. He looks at its dealings with himself. The Spaniard knows that his two neighbours, for one hundred and forty years, have been seeking to rob and overreach him ; plotting one day the partition of his property, the next, the supplanting of his heir ; constantly engaged in intrigues amongst his servants, and the one or the other insisting on ruining his steward. He sees that, during all that time, they have gained nothing; but while injuring him, have themselves squandered incalculable fortunes and in numerable lives, \u2014 what can he feel towards them but hatred and disgust ? Fortunate is it for them, he does so ; for this prevents either of them getting a footing in Spain : if the one could, the other would and could also ; and the scenes of the Inquisition would then be repeated.

It was taken by us in the name of the Archduke Charles ; this was the first stone which fell from the vast but ruinous edifice of the Spanish monarchy, and George I. would have given it up at the peace of Utrecht, so little did he estimate its worth, and the nation thought it ' a barren rock, an insignificant fort, and a useless charge.' What its real value is as regards Spain, will be understood by supposing Portland Island to be in the hands of the French. It is a bridle in the mouth of Spain and Barbary. It speaks a language of power which alone is understood and obeyed by those cognate nations. The Spaniards never knew the value of this barren rock until its loss, which now so wounds their national pride. Yet Gibraltar in the hands of England is a safeguard that Spain never can become a French province, or the Mediterranean a French lake. Hence the Bourbons north of the Pyrenees have urged their poor kinsmen-tools to make gigantic efforts to pluck out this thorn in their path. The siege by France and Spain lasted four years. Then the very ingenious M. d'Arcon's invincible floating batteries, that could neither be burnt, sunk, nor taken, were burnt, sunk, and taken by plain Englishmen, who stood to their guns on the 13th of September, 1783.\"\u2014 (p. 341.)

CHAPTER IV. EXCURSION ROUND THE STRAITS. Tetuan, June 15th. I have been a week in Barbary. I landed at Tangier, and crossed the country to this place, but I have been too busy taking in and digesting, to put pen to paper. If I could abstract my eastern self, the task of description would be comparatively easy. Yet Morocco is as different from the East, as the East is from Europe ; nor has it only the interest of diversity. This land seems the common parent of both : things come suddenly upon you, which carry you back to the earliest times, or afford the key to the commonest present customs. The idle curiosity first awakened, is soon changed to a sense of the importance of every trifle. I will begin with the last thing I have seen. I have just returned from the gardens called Kitan, about three miles from this place : they are in a wooded valley at the beginning of the fore-foot of the lesser Atlas, which towers above. We passed through lanes of tall reeds, partitioning off other gar dens, and entered by a gate a lofty apartment, com posed of split reeds woven together in various trellice patterns : over the higher parts, the vine was trained ; E 2"], [72, "52 THE GARDENS OF MOROCCO. the sides, windows, and doors were festooned with jasmine. Here our horses were left ; but the gardens in Morocco are adjusted for equitation, and the covered alleys are high enough to be ridden through. The ornamental buildings were ruined and the garden is let out as an orchard for its fruit. A broad terrace supported a reservoir on a level with the tops of the trees, and on it stood a pavilion. The whole ex hibited a stamp and character of its own, and one could quite imagine it to belong to the people who had introduced gardening into Spain ; or rather, who had converted Spain into a garden. I was no less surprised to find realised an early association of my own, of Morocco and gardens. No doubt the mate rials are here ready formed, \u2014 luxuriant vegetation, in finite variety of plants, charming sites ; and these alone are enchanting to us of more northern climes ; but none of these are wanting in Spain \u2014 at least the difference is slight, and in degree only ; but here there is a type and style. There were the same hedges of reeds ; lanes of cactus, trellices of cane. Before Mirza crossed the Straits, or the Saracens issued from the desert, the Arabs came not to teach, but to learn the culture of flowers, and the irrigation of fields : they came to pluck the fruit, not to plant the seed of the golden tree. So, in like manner, came the Greeks. I want no books to tell me where were the Hesperides. I tried to forget the taste, figure, and perfumes of the orange and lemon, and the trees that bear them, that I might,"], [73, "53 IMMUTABILITY OF MOORISH MANNERS. with the Greeks who first saw these bowers, enjoy the surprise of their dark perpetual green, of the white untiring flowers, of the freshness, ever ready for the thirsty, stinted by no season, and throughout the year lavishing on all the bounty and the fragrance of their golden fruit. I have never seen men so wild and savage; yet they are of a noble nature. The costume of the East is grand, rich, picturesque ; but here is the antique. Elsewhere men are dressed, here they are draped- The figures around are statues, not men. This is the most interesting country I have ever been in. I have trodden a new quarter of the globe, \u2014 I have beheld a new form of room, a new costume, a new kind of garden, novel and yet most ancient. At a glance you perceive that here you have got to the fountain which falls back to whence it rises. If you had broken through to a people dwelling beneath the Pyramids, you could not have firmer assurance of rest and immutability; yet they are alive and on the surface of the earth, and in sight of that giant of velocity, Europe, which has been bounding from pre- cipice to precipice of years, spanning gulfs of cen- turies, and counting thousands of revolutions of the sun to arrive only at forgetfulness.

The persecuted, the tracked and hunted of all times, creeds, and systems, have found here their last home. The ocean here stopped the wanderer and the fugitive ; the desert afforded them cover. His delight was unbounded : he has been following me about all day. The old janissary was of the Oda \" Fish.\" He showed me the fatal mark upon his arm. He took me to visit some Algerines who were em ployed in spinning silk, and in embroidery. They un bosomed themselves, and I discovered, although I might have known it before, that the Moors and the Algerines are two. One of these men had property in, I think, Tlemsin, which the French had offered to restore to him ; but he preferred staying where he was, because not afflicted by the sight of the French. Our dress, and especially our uniform, produces a painful impres sion upon the eye of the eastern, and I could refer in illustration to Napoleon's remarks on military costume when in Egypt, as given in the great work of the \" Victoires et ConquStes des Francais.\" At Tangier I had to take up my quarters in a Jew's house, and I went there late \u2014 merely to sleep ; but that was out of the question, for the Jews col lected in the patio, or centre court, made too much clatter. One night I was invited to tea by a party of Moors, from Fez, who were occupying an apart ment in the same house. This happened to be my first meeting with the gentlemen of the country \u2014 and I shall not forget it. They wore large white turbans ;"], [75, "55 A TEA-PARTY OF MOORS. were very portly, with sallow countenances, broad faces and foreheads. The haik or white gauze web, in which they are wrapped in the streets, was laid aside, and they were seated cross-legged in a small circle with the tea-tray in the middle. Tea, and a large quantity of sugar, and sweet herbs, are put into the pot together. It was the first time I had heard the name of Abd-el-Kadir pronounced. I introduced it by asking them what news of the \"Emir?\" A sud den movement of surprise followed : they turned glances of astonishment the one to the other. One of them inquired what was thought of the Emir in Europe ? I answered it was known that he was fight ing in defence of his native land. There the con versation dropped. I, at the time, imagined this reserve to be prudential ; but they hate him as an Algerine, and fear him as a disturber. They urged upon me that France was repeating in Algiers her former game in Egypt ; and England doing the re verse of what she had done ; and that France, stretch ing to Tunis on the one side, and to Morocco on the other, would involve Europe in war. I was often stopped in the streets with questions about the for tifications of Gibraltar. \" May I see,\" said one, \" a war ' between England ' and France, and I shall die content.\" \"All the Mus sulmans,\" said another, \" look to you. We have God in Heaven, and only England on earth.\" An old Algerine captain told me that, at the time of the Spanish War, the Spanish consul had explained to him as follows,"], [76, "56 THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO. why England had succoured Spain. \" The founder of their race had left to them a paper on which was written, ' I leave you ships and men, and this com mandment \u2014 when a robber appears on the earth, strike him ; but touch not the booty ; ' therefore the English drove the great Napoleon first out of Egypt, and then out of Spain, and took neither for herself.\" A Moor at Tangier, who speaks a little English, said to me, pointing to shot-marks, \"French got guns so big \u2014 Moors so big (making a circle with both arms, and then a small hole with his forefinger and thumb) and then fire away. Shame ! shame !\" The word Moor is a very awkward one. I do not like to use it, and know not what to substitute for it. There is no race so named. Barbary is in habited by Arabs and Brebers. The western part is again subdivided between the town and the country, the inhabitants of which are essentially distinct. Then the so-called kingdom of Morocco is composed of four distinct kingdoms, namely, Fas, which we call Fez, to the north ; Marueccos, which we call Morocco, in the middle ; Tafilelt to the east ; Suz to the south. The term Moor, cannot be derived from Morocco, as is generally supposed, for if it were so derived, it would be confined to Morocco. The metropolis has been sometimes at Morocco, sometimes at Fez. These kingdoms have been sepa rated. Then the Mussulman dominion in Spain has been subdivided ; then the African power predominat ing in Spain, and then the Spanish in Africa. Then"], [77, "57 THE NAME OF MOOR. there have been different dynasties and systems. A tribe has established its supremacy over the rest. A religious sect has done the same, whence the term Benimarines al Mahadehs and al Moravides. In the impossibility of fixing any term which should apply to the whole system, its races, faiths, and circum stances, the Spaniards adopted that which belonged to ancient Mauritania, and which, no doubt, was the name by which strangers knew the original race. The difficulty which has presented itself to stran gers has been no less a puzzle to themselves, and they have been wholly unable to confer a name either upon themselves or upon their country. They style themselves Mussulmans, and nothing more, and they use that term in every way. They would say \"France has attacked the Mussulmans ;\" and, again, \" There are many Mussulmans in the market,\" meaning, in the one case the Moorish State, and in the other a mere crowd. Their own history is told in the name which they give to the country, the \" West ;\" and the proper title of the Emperor of Morocco is the \" Sultan of the West.\" This was imitated by the monarchs of Portu gal when they took the title of Prince of the A Igarves. The matter at present of most immediate interest in this quarter, is the imposition of heavy duties on British Trade, of which I heard a good deal at Gibral tar. I objected to a merchant who was complaining of it, that the Sultan of Morocco was only conforming to European science and practice. Yielding to this argument, he declared it to be ungrateful, as we had"], [78, "58 THE MERCHANTS OF GIBRALTAR. stood their friends against the French \u2014 so ignorant were they at Gibraltar of what people thought and said at Tangier. I observed, that if the French did as he said, it was very ungrateful in them, yet only a consequence of our own acts. He said, \" Oh we have treaties with Morocco, and our government will take care to have them enforced.\" I asked him what confidence he could have in treaties with any power, since at Algiers, where we had a right to trade on pay ing five per cent., we have submitted to the French tariff. \" Oh,\" said he, \" the Moors are not sharp enough to see, or strong enough to take advantage of that.\" There is nothing more amusing than to hear a merchant of Gibraltar speaking about \" right \" and \" treaties.\" It is the only place where you hear such words. Yet their commerce is smuggling, which is here alone on earth interdicted by treaty. I have several times seen Dr. Hughes, the Roman catholic Bishop, a venerable and worthy man, whose name is well known in England from the persecutions he has undergone in his endeavours \u2014 and I am glad to say successful endeavours \u2014 to put down at Gibraltar that system of Church government, or rather priestly usurpation, which prevails in Ireland, and which makes Ireland England's chief difficulty \u2014 namely, paying priests by fees. He was very much puzzled to compre hend that I intended to go to Rome, and that I should be acquainted with leading persons of his church, and interested in it, without being about to join it : our conversation was constantly interrupted by his"], [79, "59 DR.

It occurred to me to repeat to him what the captain of a Tunisian man-of-war, lying in the Bay, had said to me just before. \" What the Muscovites have long been in the East, the French are now becoming in the West : the world is changed ; all (meaning Christians) have become robbers.\" The subject of proselytism was then dropped. Yet the Turk had put the case very mildly. Sir Charles Napier wrote after the battle of Meeanee, \" I rode over the horrid field, and questioned my conscience.

Towards the end of August I determined to profit by the last of the fine weather, and to take a cruise in and about the Straits, shaping my course by the will of the winds. Police and quarantine regulations are in this neighbourhood perplexing ; so I first sailed to Algeciras to get letters of introduction, and such papers as would admit me at Ceuta, and the other Spanish Presidios on the African coast. The governor anticipated my request ; the letters were folded, and the address put, in the Turkish fashion, across. The Spaniards use this form for official letters only ; it is of course a remnant of the Moors. I observed also at Algeciras, that a black cord tied to a walking stick, is the mark of judicial authority, whether civil or military, and is said to be a practice of the Goths. As we were landing, the cargo of a smuggler, just brought in, was being conveyed on men's shoulders to the royal stores. In coming across, we were en livened with the chase of a little punt, by two scam panas. The Terrible, celebrated as a smuggler, and"], [81, "61 THE TERRIBLE. subsequently as a catcher of smugglers, lay at anchor beside us. Other vessels have been constructed on her lines, but none have equalled her speed. The rig of the smuggling boats is one large lateen-sail, the mast stayed forward, a long bowsprit, carrying a jib of like proportions, and a lateen jigger. Three sails thus compose the suit : they have nearly an upright stem, a round stern, and spread well out upon the water. The Terrible, as a smuggler, could have ' run ' in one night goods to the value of \u00a320,000. We walked in very pretty gardens of a social kind \u2014 at once public and private ; they are laid out in stars, the paths diverging from centres. The gar dens are separated from the path by a small ditch and a low hedge, enough to keep out an intruder, but not to intercept the view ; so that each person has the profit of his own grounds, and the sight of all the others. After our walk, I was conducted to his house by the Fiscal, and we discussed ancient usages. He almost repeated Sir Francis Palgrave's words in speaking of liberty, that the purpose of government is only to obtain adjudication. He laughed at the use of Greek words in politics, &c. I happened to refer to the address to Charles V. of the Cortes of Arragon, when they said, \" How shall the king have strength to carry on war, unless the nation has examined into its causes, and found it to be expedient and just?\" He expressed his astonishment at hearing such a maxim quoted by an Englishman. \" For two hundred years,\" said he,"], [82, "62 CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL LARA. \" Spain has injured no one, and has been unceasingly injured by England and France, without benefit to themselves.\" On parting, he made me a present of Cornejo's \" Law Dictionary,\" a rare work. The following morning, accompanied by Mr. D. and Mr. B., I paid a visit to the general, who bore the old Iberian name of Lara ; when a very interesting conver sation took place. He was much excited by a reference to some discussions with the Governor of Gibraltar, about rebuilding the forts of St. Barbara and St. Philip, and took occasion to expatiate on the mistake of the English on the subject of Gibraltar. \" By it,\" he said, \"you may irritate Spain, but you cannot injure her or benefit yourselves. You mistake these Straits for the Dardanelles : there is no padlock on the Mediterranean. Tarifa would command the Straits if they could be commanded : you blow up and abandon Tangier which, being to windward, might have served you, and hold Gibraltar, which can never serve you in any way, un less indeed your object be to convulse Spain, and fill her with hatred of the English name.\" The gentlemen present dwelt much on the dishonourable nature of the capture of the place, and on the injury they suffered by our retention of it, and the use we made of it. One of them said it would be worth their while to give Cuba in exchange. They were surprised and delighted at hearing my opinion ; but the note was changed when I referred to Ceuta. Though I had been at Algeciras on several occasions, I now, for the first time, visited the walls. I com-"], [83, "THE WALLS OF ALGECIRAS. 63 menced on the southern side, and I could trace them around the crest of a low flat hill. The towers are close to each other, and about twenty feet square, of solid Moorish tapia. To the north they are more remarkable. A large tower projects into the sea, and is still forty feet in height. I had to scramble over solid pieces of masonry, lying about like fragments of dislocated strata ! It is not the carefully-chiselled and mathematically-adjusted blocks of the Egyptian, Persian, Greek, or Roman architec ture. The materials of these walls, not their build ing, is the marvel. One mass, twelve feet thick, twenty-five feet high, and thirty long, has fallen fifty feet, without breaking. While examining these masses, I observed in the water large globes, and thought at first they were urns, but on closer inspec tion they proved to be shot, and I found one twenty inches in diameter, and weighing about seven hundred pounds. The governor was kind enough to permit me to have it carried away \u2014 indeed, he offered me one still larger from the store in the artillery-ground. These, it is true, might have been intended for the catapulta ; but gunpowder was unquestionably known at the time to the Mussulmans. Algeciras was rased immediately on its capture, and has never been restored. That event preceded, by two years, the battle of Cressy, which England gained partly by her first use of gunpowder.

It was not Neptune with his trident upturning the walls, but Jupiter with his bolts defending them. Algeciras, Troy-like, is me morable by its destruction. The Princes of Christen dom and of Islam assembled from far and near to its siege. During this operation, the Spaniards so suffered from Gibraltar, then in the hands of the Moors, that Alonzo the Great, during whose minority it had been lost, vowed that he would retake it. After great and vain efforts, he ended his days in the camp before it. To raise money for the siege, excises were first invented. The French word Gabelle, and Gabella the Italian, come from the Spa nish Al Cabala, which is from the Arabic* This Bay is thus remarkable as the birthplace of two in ventions, which have changed in modern times the features of war and the characters of peace. The other to which I refer is at Cressy, two centuries before that.f * From Kabyle, (tribe) came cabala, which signified both cor poration and market-place. This tax was levied in the market place, and was a repetition of the tenth, which by tbe Mussul man law was levied on the spot of production. t \" The battle of Cressy furnished the earliest instance on record of the use of artillery by tbe European Christians. The history of the Spanish Arabs carries it to a much earlier period. It was employed by the Moorish king of Granada, at the siege of Baza, in 1312. It is distinctly noticed in an Arabian treatise"], [85, "65 THE INVENTION OF GUNPOWDER. The Chinese, in the beginning of the thirteenth century, used not merely gunpowder, but bombs, against the Moguls. Nothing can be more clear than the description of the latter in the Turkish writers quoted by D'Ohsson in his history of the Mogul conquests. From China and the Tartars, the discovery might have passed, as paper did, to the Arabs.

Artillery, at its very origin, attained in their hands perfection. Discoveries and practice only con duct us back to the kinds of ordnance at which they arrived per saltum and at once. Murat II. at the siege of Leodra, cast guns which carried ball of fourteen hundred weight. Such Titanic engines may still be seen at the Dardanelles, and Baron de Tott consulted respecting their use. At the battle of Chesme, in 1790, the Russian Admiral feU aboard the Turkish Admiral and drove in his guns. While the vessels were thus foul and grappling, the Turk discharged one shot from inboard ; it broke through the Russian on the opposite side. She immediately filled and sank, but locked in her deadly grasp, her antagonist sank with her. They now lie side by side \"full fathom five.\" At that time, the armament of our heaviest vessels consisted of twenty-four pounders, and of course a \"First Lord\" would have scoffed at the idea of a sixty-eight or eighty-four pounder afloat. I am afraid I should never get on if I entered on the subject of fortification ; but I may say in two words, that the structures of the Moors, so long in advance of artillery, have borne unscathed its brunt. 44 ; and about the time that Eoger Bacon was amusing himself with crackers, an Arab poet was describing the granulation of gunpowder in verse, Langles \" Apud Salverte,\" t. ii. c. 8.

There are walls for the purpose of resisting artillery, twenty five feet high and as many thick, on which the guns must have been mounted en barbette. Their Spanish pupils anticipated Vauban.* This region has been fertile in destructive inven tions.

But antiquity also furnishes her share of discoveries. It is not travelling too far to set down as belonging to the same list, the sling of the Balearic Islands, and the leaden bullets which, as \u00c6lian tells us, the Romans obtained from Morocco. The battering ram was first used at Cadiz, during the short struggle between the Ph\u0153nician colonists and their unnatu ral brothers of Carthage* The Iberian sword bor rowed by Rome, may also be recorded in presence of the first Roman colony \u2014 Carteia. We were under weigh at daylight with a light wind ; but were baffled all day by the currents.

I saw before me the worshipper landing to visit the sacred groves of Calpe, and then threading his way through the then narrow passages of the channel, I could read in his thoughts and catch from his tongue the names of Atlas and of Hercules, as he saluted the one and invoked the other. Not Greece alone, nor Ph\u0153nicia, nor Egypt ; not the known only, or the imagined, but all these together, seemed to converge to this passage and to settle on this spot. The great shades of the past wandered among the clouds, and the memory of every people floated upon the bosom of the stream.

We were close under the rock, with a sort of cave or cavern abreast of us : boats were lying within, for their masts appeared over a breakwater of loose rocks. We durst not attempt to weather the point, and every moment were exposed to the utmost peril by the slightest shift of wind or current. The long and varied sweep of the Moorish battlements became visible through the sleet, lighting up gradually, and chang ing as if presented on a stage : suddenly a long boat, well manned, emerged as if from under water, and casting us a line, towed us into the entrance, which looked landwards, and had hitherto been con cealed from us.

Mr. Borrow sends a Jew before him to the Posada ; he returns and reports that they were Jews, and then he addresses this Jew in \" Moor ish,\" and tells him they are gipsies. As if a Jew could have been mistaken about Jews ; and, as if a person who could speak Arabic, would call it \" Moor ish.\" A few pages before he has told his readers in the most off-hand manner, that the Basques are Tar tars, and that the Basque tongue comes between the Mongolian and the Manchou ! all which is equally authentic and profound \u2014 to \"his chum\" Mr. Ford.

It is then dressed up with Spanish peculiarities, and Madrid or Paris morals, and passes from hand to hand as a mirror of the Spanish mind. In reviewing the catalogue of recent works, I can point, as really influencing opinion or as referred to by travellers, only to Blanco White's Letters, and the work out of which these remarks originated. Blanco White * is a man who, writing upon any foreign country, could not fail to perplex the judgment.

This elicited a loud and general \" No.\" I then a.sked what had been the result of the experiment ?

That these were the two elements at war in England \u2014 the unwrit ten and the written law : the last was the disease, and that alone they saw or dreamed of copying. \" Then,\" said they, \" let us have your courts and judges.\" 1 told them they could not have the Bench without the Bar, and that neither could be transplanted like lettuces, or grafted like .slips of orange-trees.

The general Cortes of Spain has been constructed theoretically, without the consent or the presence of the separate kingdoms. They are thus figuratively merged, not in one of the kingdoms more powerful than the rest, but in an abstraction which they call \" constitution.\" Lamentable would be the fate of humanity if follies such as these could profit or endure. But the cards out of which this conversation arose, are worth returning to. I was surprised to see the figures such as those used by the Greeks ; to hear the suits designated as by them, and not according to the names used in Europe : but this is not all. The Spaniards are not content with the name which all other countries know them by : card, carte, carta, spielkarten, will not do for them \u2014 they call them naipes. A learned French abbe\" (Boullet) in his \" Recherches sur TOrigine des Cartes d jotter,\" makes them a French invention posterior to the use of paper, as proved by their being called cartes ! in troduced into Spain through the Basque provinces, where they took the name of naipes, from the Basque word napa, which signifies smooth !

An old writer quoted in Bursi's \" Istoria della cittd di Viterbo? has these words, \" Cards were introduced into Viterbo in 1379, from the country of the Saracens, where they are called Naib. In Italy, they were formerly known by the name Naibi. The two old Spanish lexi cographers, Tamarid and Broceuse, derive the word from the Arabs. Alderete gives the fantastic origin of the initials N. and P. of the supposed inventor, Nicholas Pepin, which the moderns have followed. Islamism has driven cards out of use among the Arabs, and has thus left us to dispute about the origin of the name. Cards and chess seem to have been combined and originally played by four persons, there being four suits of chessmen as well as of cards.

We scrambled over the sharp points of the ledges of rock to watch the current where it is most straitened and convulsive. The dark deep current close in-shore was running out ; a hundred yards or so from the rock it was running in ; farther out again, there appeared another stream from the eastward. This must have been the spot where the action took place between Didius and the Cartha ginian galleys, \"when those were seen pursuing and these flying, who hoped not for victory and dreamed not of flight.\" About one o'clock, it suddenly cleared up, and the sun burst forth in brightness over the cooled and watered earth. The shroud of the heavens broke up into heaps of white clouds, \" showing the dark blue,\" as the Highlanders say, \" through the windows of the heavens.\" The bosom of the Straits and the brows and heads of the hills were mottled by their shadow, as they drifted along, chasing each other : at equal pace poured the current, and in the same direction. Soon reissuing from cove and rock, flocks of white sails were crowding on their way back over the course which they had already twice measured. Invited by the breeze, and shamed by the example, we lingered for a while to enjoy the pleasant mood of this fitful tor rent, and then hurried on board, and were soon sweep ing down before the batteries.

Like its vis- d-vis, to which it stands at right angles, it is a rocky tongue, joined to the main by a low and narrow neck, and pointing down the Mediterranean. It is all rounded and smooth : in its figure it presents nothing salient, and in its defences displays nothing formidable. The place derives its character not from the fortifications, but from the gardens, and each serves the purpose of the other. The public works are all laid out as pleasure-grounds, and the cactus orchards are disposed in alleys on every rising ground, so as to form stockades. The tongue is formed of a chain of six dunes, or hillocks, with a seventh considerably larger at the eastern point, on which is seated a small fortress These are the seven brothers whence the name is supposed to be derived. * The fortifications, like * Septem."], [106, "86 HISTORICAL DESCRIPTION those of Gibraltar, are directed, not to command the sea, but to defend it against the land. It has no level ground in front, swept by its galleries and batteries ; but, instead, a hill approaches nearly to the glacis, and looks into the works. The landscape beyond stretches away, wooded and picturesque, to the foot of the chain or block of mountains which fill up this angle of Africa, overshadowing Tetuan on the one side, Tangier on the other, and ranging along the Straits. The only sign of human habitation is a small enclosure of white walls, with a tower perched on the green mountain side, like a city on old tapes try in some Arcadian scene. All was silent in that landscape, and it might have been taken for a pano rama, but for the Roman vexillum * fluttering from the tower, which showed that a Saracen eye watched the keep of the Goth. Two thousand years before Gibraltar was heard of, Ceuta was an important place. It is enumerated as one of the three earliest of cities.

Spain retained Ceuta when she abandoned Oran as a set-off to Gibraltar, and England, who abandoned Tangier, must have lost Gibraltar but for the help of the Moors, which was rendered because Spain occupied Ceuta ; so that, if Ceuta were not Spanish, Gibraltar would not be English ; and if Gibraltar were not English, Ceuta would not be Spanish. The Spaniards lose their own door-post of the Straits, and seize the post of their neighbours ; the English abandon Tangier (alone of the Portuguese possessions diverted from Spain), and seize that of the Spaniards. In the history of sieges, they both present the most remarkable incidents, from the un- paralleled amount of power directed against the one, and the length of time expended in attempts to reduce the other. Both have at various times exhausted the countries to which they belonged, and the nations by which they have been held. Ceuta brought on the fall of Gothic Spain. Gibraltar was the immediate cause of the war of the Spanish Succession ; and finally the smuggling trade of Gibraltar furnishes the school for the proficients for whom Ceuta is the prison. / During the war the Spanish Government placed Ceuta, to defend it from France, in the possession of England. Several English establishments were formed, and considerable sums expended, in the belief that England would never give it up ; but the immorality"], [108, "88 BUILDINGS AND GARDENS of the Government had not then overtaken the baseness of the people. The Moorish Government, however, thought this an opportunity of recovering its own, and having furnished supplies to Gibraltar, and to our fleet, and corn for our army in Spain, conceiving itself en titled to some favour, claimed the restitution of the place. The appeal proved ineffectual, although it was backed by the offer of a million of dollars. The Eng lish Government could not, as may be supposed, well urge on the Spanish Government the claims of its Moorish ally. Muley Suleyman expressed the anguish of his spirit in a distich which might have suggested Moore's celebrated lines on Poland : \u2014 \" There is no faith in our foe, There is no comfort in our friend.\" We landed within a mole or jetty which corresponds with the Ragged Staff at Gibraltar, thence ascended by a stair to the gate, crossed a bridge, and found ourselves on a lively esplanade. An alley of trees opened upwards through the straggling town, and a terrace along the sea-wall stretched eastward to the extremity of the promontory. The buildings were in the Moresco style with the columned court. The arms of Spain are to be seen at Gibraltar beside those of England \u2014 here the arms of Portugal are beside those of Spain. To the whitewash of the Spaniards and the Moors, was here added the yellow of the Portu guese, running two or three feet as a skirting round the court-yards, and along the streets : everything"], [109, "89 OF CEUTA. was dazzlingly bright, exquisitely clean, and elabo rately ornamented.* The streets are one continuation of tesselated pave ment, green, white, and red. The white is marble, the black a very dark serpentine, and the red ancient tiles, which are used as outlines for the figures : the gutter is in the centre, the pattern running on each side with a border joining in the middle. The run ning pattern is a device, such as a sprig in a Tuscan border ; but here and there, you find more ambitious conceptions \u2014 a snake, a stag, a ship, a coat-of arms, a dog attacking a bull, and, in one place, the figure of a man. I have seen something of the kind in the garden of the fortress at Lisbon. There were also the hollow bricks along the tops of walls for flowers, and the demi-flower pots, which they nail against the walls and houses, converting them into perpendicular parterres. They have also adopted the Moorish tesselated pavements for the garden walks, and yet they have neglected to copy that garden architecture which I observed at Kitan \u2014 halls and alleys constructed of a lacework of reeds, than which there is nothing more beautiful ; and as to its uses, what can be so well adapted to the training of foliage and flowers, so fitted to ensure the luxuries of the clime \u2014 that is, shade and air \u2014 and to afford protection against its inclemency \u2014 the sun with his heat and light 1 * I am told that where there are in Barbary Christian houses, they are coloured yellow by means of copperas water over the lime."], [110, "90 THE ARAB CHARACTER. But the Spaniards here are as little in Africa, as if they were in garrison at St. Juan d'Ulloa. There is not a man who knows the language of the country. They live like cattle in a pen, and spend their lives here without ever having been without the walls. They are under strict blockade \u2014 a vidette on the hill, a picket at the gate. Should a Moor bring in eggs, he has to steal out of sight of his own sentries ; and to furnish an ox, is to commit a capital offence. When the Christians venture within reach of the Moors, they are shot like dogs : they meet only after des patching a flag of truce. What a ludicrous dispro portion between this array of towers, battlements, materials, troops, and discipline, and the half dozen wild mountaineers in a reed hut on the other side. It was said of the Arabs by a French general, \" Among them, peace cannot be purchased by victory.\" Defeat does not bring submission, nor hopelessness despair, because the brain has not robbed the heart, nor the tongue the brain. They cannot comprehend the wisdom, that a fact which is wrong should be sub mitted to because it is accomplished, and called a fact. As I was, some time before, sailing by Ceuta in a bullock-boat, from Tetuan, a Spanish sailor called the attention of a young and delicate-looking Moor, who had embarked with us on his way to Mecca, to the Spanish flag flying on the fortress.

They were then to present themselves in the Bay of Tangier, communicate with the French Consul, visit Gibraltar, and return to Algiers \u2014 a nicely devised scheme to- convince the Moor that a con spiracy against them was on foot, common to France, England, and Spain. But the French Government not having altogether resigned itself into the hands of its \" Algerines,\" thought proper to appoint a superior officer of another service to go this round and report upon it. The first place he called at was Melilla; he inquired, \" What news from Morocco 1 \" The go vernor told him that he would be able to satisfy his curiosity on the day following, as they expected the Madrid papers. The French Admiral dined with the governor, took a siesta, Spanish fashion, and had, on awaking, an opportunity of judging of the intercourse with the interior. Two or three Moors got into an out-post unob.served, and had escaped in like man ner, leaving behind the bodies of six Spaniards, but carrying off the heads. The next morning I started early to visit the works on the lines, accompanied by a merchant of the place whom the governor sent to me, as the person best qualified to act as cicerone. Issuing from the first gate, we came on a drawbridge : below"], [112, "92 THE FORTIFICATIONS. ran the sea over yellow sand, there being a clear passage by the ditch from one side to the other. Fishing-boats were splashing round the sharp angles- The old lofty Portuguese battlements rose above us ; these masses of building are enormous, though the space of ground covered is small. The body of the place from which we had emerged, consists of a cur tain and two bastions, three hundred yards in length, ninety feet in height ; the bastion to the south car rying a second, is twenty feet higher. As we pro ceeded, ditch succeeded to ditch, and battery to battery. There are three lines and three ditches, with corresponding demi-lunes ; in all six tiers of guns. The basis from sea to sea does not exceed four hundred yards, and the radius may be equal : I give the dimensions from memory. There are few guns mounted ; I counted about one hundred and fifty embrasures for guns, and twenty beds for mortars. The inner curtain is completely pitted with shot and grape. The upper works and merlons are refaced. Emerging from the fortification, we began to ascend the hill : the face of it was cut into by level spaces, the earth banked up by stone walls, lining which, infantry could level their pieces up the hill. The whole ground is mined and traversed by pas sages, the roofs of which project above the soil with loop-holes. The vidette on the hill pointed out to us on a brow opposite, at a short distance \u2014 but divided by a chasm \u2014 the Moorish post, a low shed of reeds : we saw no one.

I came suddenly on a mass of ruins clustering round eminences, or run ning in long straight lines, castellated and turreted : the angles were fresh and sharp. The holes left in the walls by the fastenings of the planks, into which the compost is beaten, gave them the appearance of enormous pigeon-houses. There were no Roman blocks ; yet the style was Roman. There was none of the massiveness of the Moorish, but their materials. There was more of the palm-like lightness of Fars than of the troglodyte of ancient or modern Africa. I hoped that these might belong to some remnants of the earlier and untraced races ; but a nearer inspec tion soon decided that question. A gate on the western face is still almost perfect, and is Moorish ; yet who can find the date of that style which may have belonged to the days of Juba, as well as to those of Almanzor and Abderahman. My companion was excessively alarmed when I proposed to visit the ruins, as they are beyond the neutral ground. I endeavoured to relieve him, by making a forward cast through the brushwood. He followed, detailing how those savages would lie for hours in wait for a shot, and how a few days before a man had been wounded at the same place. Presently he exclaimed, \" A Moor ! a Moor ! \" I had, however, for some time seen the figure in a clear space on the opposite brow, wrapped in its haik, and motionless.

What then to discover a living representative of a race that has left behind it an undying name and immortal ruins ] Such was to me that solitary figure. The Assyrian bowed his back to the burthen and his neck to the yoke, and the first of conquerors became the meanest of slaves. The Mede served in his turn, and so the Persian. The Egyptian, the first and greatest, became the outcast of nations. The Macedonian and Attic conquerors of the East were bondsmen at Rome. The Roman was a hewer of wood and a drawer of water, at the door of the Gothic hut and the Vandal tent. In all times, in all climes, the conquered have dwelt as Helot bondsman or slave with the conqueror. This wild man, this Moor, alone has followed no con queror's car, and served no master's bidding.

Science has de parted, but is that an essential of greatness 1 When a nation sinks to the barbarism that follows light, it is indifferent to honour : it hates itself more than its foe or conqueror. The Moor is not such. The Moors at home are more wedded than any Mussulman people to their usages ; more fanatic, more abhorrent of all intercourse with strangers. When they come to Europe they make themselves at home. They are seen at Gibraltar, in the streets, on the battlements, sauntering in the public walks, as if they entirely belonged to us. The civil magistrate represents them as orderly and peaceable : the police court may be said to ignore their existence : legal practitioners declare that the cases of litigation chiefly arise from their being overreached. They are an example of sobriety, industry, and integrity. Their community at Gibraltar is neither small nor select, nor composed solely of those in easy circumstances : they come and go, and many are flying destitute from war and persecution.

As we returned into town, a stone nearly the size of a man's head was shown to us, by which the skull of the Portuguese commander who first entered the place was, like that of Pyrrhus, broken by a woman from a tower.

The Romans at one time substituted this place for Tangier, as a provincial capital ; yet it has neither a harbour nor road, being at the extreme point of the land, and shut out by a range of mountains from a fertile and peopled country, while Tangier is at the bottom of a bay, surrounded with rich lands, and is on the highway from Spain to Mauritania, from the ocean to the interior. To us a capital is different from what it was to the Romans : we have a mass of organization and adminis tration, which requires that it should be placed at the head in respect to the members. We expect to find all this in vigour under so rigorous a government as"], [117, "AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. 97 that of Rome. But Rome gave herself no such trouble ; introduced neither principles, nor laws, nor language, nor costume. These spread, because not forced. The field of administration, down to her latter days, was kept sufficiently clear for each individual to embrace the whole : the subdivisions of modern statesmanship and government were unknown.* Her judicatories were solely appellant : the people were everywhere free to follow their own customs, execute their own laws, select their own magistrates, impose their own taxes. In fact, the Romans were kings : they reigned, they did not administer '; nor did they scatter their strength in exciting irritation on every point; but remained with a force collected to smite resistance whenever it appeared, and which they were careful never to provoke by systematic interference.

On both occasions she had no fleet. Armies were requisite to attack, but incapacitated for defence : heroic defences were always made by a people, as shown in the contrast of Algeria with Poland ; as shown in the contrast of Spain with Germany and Italy, which had all bowed before Napoleon : Spain's strength appeared after army, king, government, had been swept away ; she was the only country in Europe whose people did not want soldiers to protect them, &c.

His Spanish self-love, for a moment alarmed, was soothed when I showed him that I was as adverse to standing armies for the internal interest of the great and preponderat ing States, as he could be, because of the facilities which it gave them of interfering with and oppressing the others. I pointed to this, as the master-disease of our times, and as signalized as such even in the last century, by some of the greatest men ; that it feeds, as Montesquieu says, upon itself, growing by competi tion ; and that, independently of their misuse, stand ing armies by their pressure must ultimately bring every one of the existing European States to the ground. Spain, separated by the Pyrenees from the rest of Europe, as she is distinct from them in ideas, could easily relieve herself; she had fewer obstacles to contend with than any other State, except England.

This conversation was strikingly recalled to me by a book, entitled \"Political Testament of Cardinal Alberoni,\" which, on my return, I found at a stall. I turned over the pages with extreme curiosity, to see if it presented any stamp of authenticity. One of the first sentences I fell upon was the following : \" It is an error of this and the preceding century to think that the strength of a nation consists in the large number of regular forces kept on foot. To be convinced of the falsity of this notion, we have only to cast an eye on the wars of Europe within these four or five hundred years. As soon as an army is beaten on the frontier, the prince, whose troops are vanquished, has no other resource left but to clap up a peace : his country lies open to the enemy, and he has only cowardly burghers and disheartened peasants to oppose to veteran sol diers. He loses a whole province as soon as the capital of it surrenders. He is seduced to bury himself under the ruins of his throne, or to comply with the con ditions prescribed by the conqueror. \"But when princes undertook only to lead their people in defending their country, they reckoned as many soldiers as subjects : the whole state was a frontier against the enemy, who were sure to meet with opposition so long as they fought to conquer."], [129, "THE TRUE DEFENCE OF A NATION. 109 Every inch of ground was disputed. When a city or town surrendered, after repeated assaults, it did not capitulate for the other towns within its juris diction. Every borough, every village cost a siege. So long as a prince kept but a corner of his country, he might hope to drive the enemy from what they possessed, and to recover all he had lost. The most powerful prince in Europe was dreaded only as his ambition might give disturbance and uneasiness to his neighbours. They were sure that time would impair his strength, like a body worn out by too frequent attrition. \" The difference between the reigns of Charles VI. and Louis XIV., in France, shows this contrast in its full light. The King of England was then master of the finest provinces in France, quiet possessor of its principal cities, and crowned at Paris ; while his adversary, though reduced to the single lordship of Bourges, was able to hold out against him. Louis XIV. sees a frontier province invaded by two of the enemy's generals ; he offers, at St. Gertrudenberg, the fruit of twenty victories, to persuade them to retire. His kingdom is still untouched : millions of his sub jects have not so much as heard the sound of the enemy's cannon, and yet he does not think himself able to make a stand against seventy or eighty thou sand men. He has not as yet lost one battle on his ancient territories ; nevertheless, he thinks that no thing more remains for him than to die gloriously, pushed on by temerity and despair.

Jandrecy and Quenoy determine the fate of France. Valenciennes and Dunquerque, Arras, Amiens, Cambrai, Maubeuge and so many other strong-holds, which his predeces sors either never possessed, or, if they did, afterwards resigned, without imagining they weakened thereby their throne ; all these places, I say, to him appear as of no sort of use, because he has no regular troops to defend them. \" If the land forces of Spain had been upon this footing in the beginning of the present century, the nation would have beheld with as much security as contempt, the combination of the Courts of Vienna and London to impose a master upon her, and to divide her possessions.

He had"], [131, "OF CARDINAL ALBERONI. 111 penetrated to the Gothic foundations of the society of the peninsula, and had ascended to those Gothic pinnacles, from which he could survey the littleness of his contemporaries.

He was above the arts of government, and knew where the greatness of his adopted country resided. He scouted acquisitions as a source of splendour to the state, or patronage as a means of strength to the government.

It is impossible to preserve Gibraltar without the goodwill either of Spain or of Morocco, because our subsistence must be drawn either from the one or the other country. When we are with Spain the Moors are against us ; but then we do not need them : when we are against Spain, then we are sure to have the Moors with us. This is the meaning of Lord Nelson's words, \u2014 \" Should Great Britain be at war with any European maritime state, Morocco must be friendly to us, or else we must obtain possession of Tangier.\" Lord Nelson did not, however, see that the measure he pro posed for obtaining that aid, would have had the opposite effect. If you seized Tangier you would place yourselves in the same position in respect to Morocco that Spain is at Ceuta, and be under a total inability of gaining the means of subsistence either from Morocco or Spain, for Tangier or Gibraltar. This judgment of Lord Nelson, thus reduced to its true application, is of the greatest importance.

I had learnt these circum stances through official persons, I was now come to the other side of the water. Here again from an official person, and this time in a published book, breaks out the disgust and irritation engendered in Morocco. Common fame represents the governor of Gibraltar as having been engaged without measure or disguise, in embroiling the French and the Moors. He and the ambassador from Madrid took the extraordinary step of landing in Morocco at the moment when the appearance of any intermeddling on their part was exactly the thing to drive matters to extremity : they publicly held out encouragement to the Moors. The government at home has declared itself most formally in an opposite sense, and the foreign minister is a man whose word no one ever doubted. The only conclusion, therefore, is that the cabinet is not in the confidence of its agents. It stands to reason that in affairs carried on in secret, the acting hand will be the one which is not seen. Former governors of this place have managed their own garrison and fort without distracting Spain or Morocco ; this governor, then, must have been selected for the work he has performed. The qualifications and antecedents required are those of a soldier. Out of all the army, one only could be selected on whom had been inflicted the penalty of professional disgrace for heading a mob against his sovereign's troops : \u2014 that one was selected.

This outrage upon discipline was perpetrated by the head of the British army, and the strictest of discipli narians. In 1817 there was a pamphlet published which, with equal ability and foresight, exposed the great error which had been committed at the congress of Vienna, in looking to France as the power from which future danger would emanate. In that pamphlet it was shown that by an undue depression of France the future peace of Europe was placed in jeopardy : its text and conclusion was, \" A lexander has inherited Europe from Napoleon.\" The author of this pamphlet had henceforth to be classed amongst the men peculiarly deserving the attention of the Russian cabinet.

The Marshal threw the letter upon the ground and stamped upon it, and taking the aide-de-camp by the arm, said \" M. de V. vous en serez.\" On the 14th the son of the Sultan is awakened by an alarm, \" The French army is in sight?

They had formally announced to the Sultan, that if he prosecuted his present system of intercourse with Europeans, and of commercial monopoly, they would reserve their strength to defend their own mountains. The French government, in like manner, had every disposition to make peace, and every reason to avoid war. Its dread was not Morocco, but Algiers : its interests were bound up with Morocco against the military colonial usurpation that defied the power of the cabinet, and threatened the institutions of the country.

A Moorish house is a square, with blind walls out side, and a court within. A corridor, sustained by pillars, runs round, and affords an opening and light to the rooms : the court is paved with marble, or is in mosaics, the place of meeting of the family. From this type the domestic architecture of Cadiz is derived. The soil upon which the city stands is occupied with those square blocks fitted one against the other, leaving no patch vacant. There is no thing that is not house or street. The houses, however, have windows on that side which faces the street. The roofs are flat, terraced, parapeted, and surmounted by square towers, sometimes three stories high. These roofs are the basse cour. There the poultry is kept, the washing, and all dirty work done, and the linen hung out to dry. * Here the inmates ascend, in the summer evenings, to enjoy the breeze, and in the winter days to bask in the sun. Above the sounds and bustle of the city, * It is hung up wet for two reasons ; \u2014 not to strain it by wringing, and to bleach it better."], [147, "127 HOUSES AT CADIZ. amid airy terraces, which, but for the want of water, might rival the hanging gardens of Babylon, looking out on the bright sea, and down and around on the shining city, the Gaditanas walk, converse, and observe their neighbours similarly employed on the neighbouring battlements. As the houses adjoin, they are cut off from each other by parapets. Otherwise, the means of communication above would be nearly as complete as in the deep cuts of the streets that divide the masses. But to see Cadiz, you must ascend one of her towers,* in the still night, and under the moon. The aspect from below is scarcely less striking. The streets are very narrow : to exclude the sun, the houses are constructed to keep out the heat. From every window projects an iron cage (reja) or balcony \u2014 many of these glazed round, and resembling an oriel window. These verandas are filled with flowers, or shrouded in a mantle of ivy. The building is relieved by the gayest colours \u2014 bright sea-green, red, and yellow. The iron work is green.

There is no more charming, urban sight, than that presented in looking down the narrow streets. The verandas approach from the opposite sides, with their lively colours, their shrubs, and flowers. Everything is fresh, and clean, and bright, as if just from the workman's hands. Within, white reigns alone, above, and around. As you pass by, you have a succession of glimpses into the co lumned patios, neat, bright, and shiny, embellished with plants, flowers, and fountains.* The doorways are grand and beautiful, and resemble the portals of cathedrals, rather than the entrances to dwelling-houses. In the larger houses the doors are made of slabs of shining mahogany, studded with knobs of brass. The lintels and architraves are orna mented and carved with an elaboration and a variety that afford constant occupation to the stranger in his walks. The Gate belongs, of course, to the land of the Caravan. It is the place of welcome, and its grandeur is the sign of hospitality.

New experience awaits us here : when marble is exchanged for brick, and the sun takes the place of fog, shade is comfort, and damp luxury. The Spanish portal acquired a dignity rather Chi nese than Moorish, from the escutcheon. At Valez Malaga I was shown the built-up door in the man sion of a noble, who, being ordered to take down his arms from his door, built up the entrance, leav ing the arms, and struck out a hole in the wall beside it. The cathedral is a graceful and original modern building. There is a great falling off in the parts recently completed. From its top there is a splendid view of the sea-girt city, the bay, and the surrounding lands. It is all marble, and the roof shelves off from the cupola to the edge without parapet, so that you look out on the sea. In winter the spray passes over the building, so that it well merits its arms,\u2014 a cross standing on the water. In the sacristy there were five large marble reser voirs, with the syphon of a fountain over them, for the priests to wash at.

This usage, however interesting as a relic, is not fruitful as a practice. The Spaniards are not a cleanly people : in their struggle of seven centuries with their washing and bathing foes, they placed their patriotism on the side of filth. From the top of the cathedral I had observed some old ruins, and a circular tower, that looked Roman. It was the Moorish castle, and afforded me the oppor tunity of verifying a point which previously had been to me doubtful. These ruins are so built on, and so covered up, that it is difficult to trace them ; but I made out Moorish walls, with square stones joined with lime. It has been a small castle stand ing by itself, opposite the water-gate of the town, and not part of a circuit of walls. One round tower still stands, about forty feet high. There is a portion of wall exposed, of between thirty and forty feet in thickness, in stone and lime. The chamber in the principal tower is, like all those in Moorish towers, neatly arched and ornamented. The staircase is in the substance of the wall, not in the centre of the tower. At Porta St. Maria, opposite Cadiz, I found a similar Moorish ruin. This is the point of embarkation of Xeres, or the Port of Sherry.

The cellars are worth seeing \u2014 if spacious and lofty edifices can be so called. The people of Cadiz neither put their bodies in graves nor their wines in cellars : the dead are built up in walls, resembling bins of a wine-cellar ; their wines are deposited in structures like cathedrals. The niches are like the dwellings of the living, some for ever and a day, others for a term of years ; after which the fragments of the former tenant are ejected, and the place swept clean for another.

The church of St. Philippo Negri deserves a visit. It is a lofty oval hall. The altar is in a deep recess, and two narrow galleries run round it at a considerable height. In this church, in a back street of an out post almost cut off from Spain, some unknown and self-designated politicians wove, in 1812, out of the threads of the philosophy of France, a tissue which was to clothe the nakedness of Spain, and to rege nerate her. At that moment she was engaged in a desperate war with France. By those very doctrines her despot trampled on the liberties of France, and then converted her into the slavish instrument of his evil passions and lawless purposes against Spain. Up to the time when this constitution was pro claimed, faction, which had divided and distracted, for a century and a half, the other countries of Europe, had still in Spain been unknown. St. Philippo is thus a spot associated with greatness \u2014but greatness of an easy kind. It is easier to kill a camel than \u2014 sometimes\u2014 to catch a flea. Cadiz, Oct. 26th. I made an excursion yesterday, in a Calesa, to the mainland, or rather, to the Isla St. Leon, which adjoins"], [153, "SALT-PANS OF THE ISLA ST. LEON. 133 it. After traveUing about four miles along the narrow ridge of sand that joins Cadiz to the main, you turn to the left, round the bottom of the bay, and enter on. the salt pans, which extend throughout the Isla. There were ditches, tanks, and reservoirs, cut out in all shapes and dimensions. Heaps of salt were scattered about like pyramids ; some, twenty feet high. I expected to obtain data respecting the evaporation of the Mediterranean, but was disappointed : neither is the water allowed to deposit in one place, nor are there successive fillings of water into the same basin before the salt is made. In either case, the rate of evaporation would have been furnished exactly ; but the water passes through successive pans, becom- ing more and more charged as it advances to the inner tanks, where the crystallization is ultimately effected, \u2014 a process even then attended with difficulty.* There are, in the Isla, twelve government and seventy- two private works; the produce ofthe first is 12,000, of the other, 40,000 lasts. The cost is six quarts the Fanega ; it is sold at fifty-two reals. The salt made at the private works is for exportation, and is taken off by the English, Americans, and French. These and the other salt-works of Galicia, the Asturias, &c, are farmed for 12,000,000 reals, by a singular adventurer of the court and the exchange, \u2014 M. Salamanca.

The Isla de Leon is a low marsh, which forms the bottom of the bay. In the island is St. Fernando, situated on broken ground. I could trace the salt river from its source, or mouth, in the sea, to its other source, or mouth, in the bay. At the sea-entrance, I could distinguish the small island or knoll of St. Petri. Here stood the Altars of Hercules. It was to visit this spot that I had started from Cadiz ; and finding it impracticable, from the time of day and the roughness of the weather, I had, with great reluctance, given up the project. It was some compensation to see, at least, the spot. An antique bridge joins the Isla to the mainland : it stands about half-way between the bay and the sea. It was rather a causeway, with arches, than a bridge, and was said to be Ph\u0153nician. At Cadiz, one is in the midst of a town, and the very type and essence of towns. The eye has no scope, and the mind no sight, for anything but itself. It is impossible to think of it as Gades, or to recall Circe's smile, or Cerberus' growl ; but here I reco vered myself, and yielded to the intoxication which, on certain spots, the mists of past things produce. Cadiz did again become Gades. Behind appeared, on the side of a hill, or rather, close to its summit, Medina Sidonia, recalling, in one name, the Ph\u0153ni cian and the Moor.

There was a sacrifice, but not to idols ; there was an altar, but no groves or high places. Wines were forbidden, which were not forbidden in Ph\u0153nicia or Egypt. Women were excluded from the sacrifices ; the sacred flame was kept burning ; the priests served barefoot. When they entered, their faces were veiled, and their heads covered with white linen. This, then, was a temple of the Hebrews, and not of idolaters.* Amongst the dwellers in Canaan, there were those who had preserved primeval light, and are called in scripture \" worshippers of the true God.\" Balaam was a prophet, and the book of the Arab Job is one of the books of Scripture. From St. Fernando I could command the field where Tarik triumphed, and where Roderick fell. The sudden extinction of the Gothic empire has led to the inference that it was rotten : the valour with * Herodotus (ii. 40. 145) mentions one tribe of tbe Pelasgi who had no images, and worshipped one supreme God, whose name they never pronounced."], [156, "136 THE GOTHS IN SPAIN. which that field was contested forbids that conclusion. The factions, and the contests for the crown amongst the Goths, differed little from those amongst the Saracens ; the people were not divided, and had lost nothing of their valour and their warlike spirit.* The Arabs triumphed in Spain in like manner as Islamism did in Africa. The Goths were not the only inhabi tants ; the original population was still in existence, and identified with that of Hispania Transfretana. To these the Saracens were deliverers, not invaders. They were invited over by the Jews, a numerous, and then a warlike people, preserving many ties with the Arab population of both countries, and forming the link between them and the old Iberians. It is not extraordinary that there should have been native Spaniards in the armies of the Goths, without the fact being recorded. So uncertain are all our data, that it is disputed whether Count Julian was a Mussulman or a Christian ; whether Tarik was a Breber, a Persian, or an Arab. In periods nearer to our own, when European literature flourished, omissions and mistakes of a similar kind are not uncommon. For instance, at the battle of Angora the contest, as it is sup posed, was between the Turks and the Tartars ; but the body of the troops of Bajazet were neither Turks nor Mussulmans, but Servians. The association of the people of Spain with those of * Muza when questioned by the Kalis as to the character of the different people of the West, says of the Goths, \" They are champions who do not turn the back on the foe.\""], [157, "137 BATTLE OF THE GUADALETE. Mauritania, while both were Christians, is further esta blished by the use of Arabic in the old Spanish church. It is recorded with wonder that their works on theo logy were in that tongue, and that a large proportion of its priesthood knew no other. This Arabic lite rature dates from a time anterior to the Arab conquest. It was from Africa that Spain received Christianity. But modern Spanish writers would be careful to conceal or disguise the early association of Spain with the people and the system against which raged their fanaticism. It is the suppression of all this that has made the conquest of the Arabs appear like a fable. Cardonne estimates, at the battle of the Guadalete, the Goths at 100,000, and the Arabs at 12,000. Gibbon makes the Arabs less. Another writer says : \u2014 \" It was no longer the terrible Goths, whose valour had overthrown the Roman empire, that had pene trated from the shores of the Euxine to those of the Atlantic. The youth, enervated with peace and lux ury, had abandoned the exercise of arms. The chiefs, impelled by jealousy, revenge, or ambition, betrayed their monarch to those who sought his ruin.\" And presently we have, \u2014 \" The two armies fought long and with equal ardour. The uncertain victory was decided in favour of the Mussulmans by a horrible treason. Opas, Archbishop of Seville, collecting his vassals, joined the ranks of the Mussulmans and attacked the Christians.

We have therefore to look for some other cause than the effeminacy of the one, and the valour of the other. Count Julian could put the Moors in posses sion of Ceuta, and in joining them draw all his ad herents with him, \u2014 the Archbishop of Seville could quit the camp with all his followers, a fact which has no parallel, and join the invading Mussulman : \u2014 there existed, then, links between the two people not to be found in the romances of the Spanish writers, or in the phrases of Gibbon. Thus, the enterprise ceases to be a fable, and regains its just station as one of the most hardy and successful of human achievements. In speaking of the burning, by Cortes, of his vessels on the coast of Mexico, Robertson remarks : \u2014 \" Thus, by an act of magnanimity to which history offers no thing to be compared, did 500 men consent to shut themselves up in a hostile land, covered with nations numerous and unknown, and after destroying their means of retreat, remained with no other resource than their valour and their perseverance.\" He forgot horses,"], [159, "139 THE BATTLE OF THE GUADALETE. gunpowder, and artillery. But the Spaniards in the New World only repeated the lesson they had learnt from the Moors in the Old, and the Moors only repeated what the Sicilian Agathocles had already performed in his wonderful home-thrust against Carthage. The Moorish chief, at the head of 7,000, or \u2014 as Gibbon makes them \u2014 5000 men, sent, Scipio-like, to invade the powerful and warlike peninsula (that was itself invading Africa), adopted the same expedient, and induced his more numerous followers, in face of a far greater danger, to submit to the same alternative. They burnt their vessels in the port of Gibraltar. They thus cut off their retreat, in case of a repulse, as effectually as if the whole Atlantic spread between them and their native land. The address of Tarik to his followers was, \u2014 \" The enemy is before you, the sea is behind, \u2014 follow me.\" After the victory, the Moors, instead of advancing, as in a hostile country, dispersed, as after the defeat of a usurper, to take possession. One body marched upon Ecija, a strongly-fortified place ; the whole population perished in the defence, or after the cap ture : another upon Corduba ; it was surrendered by the inhabitants ; the governor of the garrison, however, preferred death to submission. Another body took possession of Granada ; Tarik himself marched on the capital, Toledo. All these places made sepa rate capitulations, and preserved the exercise of their religion : they were to pay only such taxes as were paid to their kings ; they were to preserve their laws,"], [160, "140 THE GOTHS AND SARACENS and their magistrates. The churches were generally divided between the Mussulman and the Christian. The same conditions, excepting double tribute, were granted to the cities that made the most desperate resistance. It was on a system that they acted, and not upon emergency \u2014 by a rule, and not according to circumstances or expediency.* The valour of the Goths was desperate and self devoted. The division of the churches between the two religions shows the rapidity with which conversion ac companied, or rather had prepared, their triumph. The Goths were originally but an army that entered Spain, to protect its inhabitants. When Spain afterwards recovered herself from the Saracens, she. was alto gether Gothic, with no trace of the old population, except in the Basque provinces, where neither the Goths had penetrated before, nor did the Saracens after.

History shows us the Arabs as the least exacting, the least cruel of all conquerors. They have shown the example of those peaceful conquests, which we recom mend to the governments of the nineteenth century.

It was Islamism that aided the conquests of the Saracens. Its force lay in applying the dictates of religion directly as a restraint upon the conduct of govern ment, rendering the king, as well as his humblest vassal, equally subjects of the law. Within a few months from the battle of Guadalete, the Moorish troops had passed beyond the Pyrenees, and were encamped at Carcassone. There the tide of victory was arrested, not by the hammer of Martel, but by orders from Damascus. It was the project of the Saracen chief to conquer France, and thence to march to the attack of the Greek empire in the rear. When the Saracens did invade France, it was after the generation of conquerors had passed away \u2014 when France was recovering from the lethargy of her Merovingian race, and when a schism had been established between Spain and the Caliphate. The empire established by this victory is the most remarkable instance of prosperity that the world has ever seen. The town of Corduba contained 200,000 houses ; in its public library there were 600,000 volumes. It had 900 public baths. On the banks of the Guadalquivir there were 12,000 villages ; and such were the fruits they drew from the soil, such the profits of their industry, which furnished to the East luxuries and arms, that the public revenue of Spain in the tenth century was equal to the collective revenues of all the other kings of Europe.

Five centuries and a half later, this plain was again the theatre of great events : the Christian principalities had again regained strength, the Mus sulmans expending themselves in internal wars in Spain, and between the Peninsula and Morocco. The battle of Las Navas de Tolosa had taken place. St. Ferdinand had entered their capital and taken Se ville, when the elevation of his son Alfonso the Sage \u2014 but in his early years designated the Brave \u2014 to the crown of Castile, gave promise of a speedy emancipa tion of the Peninsula, aided as he was by the valiant James of Aragon, who had successfully contested against them no less than thirty fields. Alfonso retook from the Mussulmans, Xeres and all the surrounding towns ; but, very soon absorbed in the vain expectation of becoming Emperor of Germany, and less successful than his successor, Charles V., or England's candidate for the Spanish crown, Charles VI, he squandered the means of his subjects in a project that was hateful to them ; lost the time and the occa sion of following up his successes, and brought upon Spain new dangers from Africa.

The soldiers on the wall having all fallen, the governor, Don Garcia di Gomez, maintained the place alone, and refused to surrender, though himself covered with wounds : the Moors, struck with admiration, determined to preserve his life in spite of himself ; lifted him off the wall with hooks, and then cured him of his wounds. I found the astronomer at the observatory, M. de Sercera, a person no less interesting in his general conversation than distinguished for his scientific ac quirements ; and I received from him and from others some most unexpected information respecting a recent event which has had most important consequences for Europe.

It appears that the plot was undisguisedly conducted by Russia ; that the Bailiff de Tatischeff,* \u2014 then the representative of Russia * This diplomatist was subsequently removed, on the appli cation of Ferdinand to the Emperor Alexander, through Capo DTstrias. The king wrote these words : \" I, who appear to be King of Spain, am only the servant (criado) of the Baile de Tatischeff.\" Capo D'lstrias, to whom the scrap of paper was brought, and who was then passing through Italy, promised that, fifteen days after his arrival at St. Petersburg, the obnoxious ambassador should be removed.

The work had been accomplished, and TJgarte was left behind. The Baile having proved himself so successful with a king, was then sent to try his hand on an emperor. This fact I have had from the agent employed by Ferdinand. It is curious that Spain should have got rid of a Russian ambas sador, and kicked out an English one. It is curious that it should have been for the same cause. In the first case, however, the evil was already done.

EXCURSION ROUND THE STRAITS. Cadiz, Oct. 24th. In the land of the Hindoos, far away from the ocean, there is a building called the Pearl Mosque. The Spaniards call their Cadiz, the City of Silver. But Cadiz is the daughter, not of the land but, of the sea, and is the pearl of cities. The impression of brightness I have received in Cadiz does not, however, arise from the lustre of these silvery turrets, but from a swarm of women covering the floor of the cathedral with a mass of silk blonde tresses, and eyes, shining, fluttering, gleaming \u2014 and all is black. I had passed from the Ommiades to the Abassides. In that monumental uniformity there are a fascination and a grandeur, which scatter to the wind our freaks of fashion. How contemptible the devices of our continual change, when contrasted with the things discovered, used, and preserved by a whole people !

To this I have been led by the fact that changes are in progress. The day may come when, having exhausted variety without finding contentment, this people may try to go back, and endeavour with pain to regain what now, in heedlessness, they are casting away : then will it be interesting to know what, while Spain still retained manners of her own, struck the passing stranger. The milliners of Paris, it is a common saying, have accomplished* what the arms of Napoleon were unable to achieve, \u2014 as if female vanity had broken down na tional character and taste, which masculine sense struggled to uphold. Alas ! for the dignity of man hood ; \u2014 it is the tailors, not the milliners of Paris, who have triumphed where German insolence, Bourbon fraud, and imperial victories alike had failed. Spain lives only in the peasantry, and in that sex which an Eastern sage has said is \" the first to hope and the last to despair.\" The men we see walking about the streets are the ordinary persons inhabiting European towns. You are reminded that you are * A lady, writing from the north of Scotland, thus speaks of the double invasion there of bonnets and poor : \u2014 \" Bonnets have been the destruction of the Caithness servants : what they spend on these, and flowers and ribands (instead of the linsey-wolsey petticoat, cotton jacket, and snood), would keep their parents in meal for months ; but, of course, now that there is a ' legal as sessment,' what need they care or \" scrimp \" themselves, only to spare the parish.\" \u2014 \" She (an old woman of ninety-two) told me, that formerly there was more love among neighbours than now among brothers.\""], [167, "147 THE MANTILLA. \u2014 THE MANTA. in a country which is itself only when you see the women. The crown of this costume is the mantilla. It belongs to the class of vestures intended to screen, not to parade : it nevertheless enhances and sets off beyond every device and contrivance of mere dis play. The ancient form, the manta, was within the century known in sequestered places. It is in com mon use in the transatlantic possessions or offshoots of Spain : it lingers still on the verge of the Penin sula at Tarifa, where I have mentioned it. The manta * is a stripe of black taffeta or serge, two yards long by one broad. Three cords are run through it lengthways at one edge ; by these it is bound and puckered round the waist : it is then turned up like a petticoat over the head and shoulders, and is gathered in the hand upon the breast. In front there is a lappet of about six inches' width, lined with crimson silk, which comes round the face. Encasing the person from the waist upwards, it is an admirable protection against wind, rain, and sun. One eye only \u2014 generally the left one \u2014 is exposed. Thus Solomon sings : \" With thy one eye thou hast bewitched me Backed by such authority, I may venture to say that it is not without its ostensible beauties as well as its revelations of grace and attractions of conceal ment.

The faldett of the women of Malta is of the same description. The petticoat being also black, the dress appears all of one piece. as originally it was. The name of the costume is saya^manta. The mantilla is the manta narrowed, loosened from the waist and fastened on the head. There are two kinds.*\" The mantilla de tiro is that worn by the peasantry : it is of black serge trimmed with velvet. It is worn high on the head, and round upon the face. The second, the costume of the city, is the mantilla de blonda : it is of silk, rich and stiff; plain or flowered, and differs from the other by hav ing blonde to the depth of twelve inches all round. The blonde is deeper in front, so as to serve as a veil. The edge of the silk is fastened to the comb at the crown of the head ; the silk falls behind, the lace before, unless gathered up. It is secured in windy weather against the cheek by the tip of the fan. The mantilla, when dropped on the shoulders, degene rates into a veil joined to an unmeaning scarf or a tippet ; yet this is now become the fashion. The whole is sometimes of lace \u2014 when it is only a bagged hood. The mantilla is not spoken of as a piece of dress that fits well or ill. Such a lady, they say, wears her mantilla well, just as if they were speaking of a ship carrying her colours.

The mantillas, reversing the effect of our costume \u2014 which is to impress the wearer with the feelings of a block \u2014 gives at once freedom and dexterity. The mantilla, fan, castanet, guitar and dance \u2014 which last is not here the business of the legs alone \u2014 keep the arms always busy. The head is disencumbered of bonnet, cap, ribands and curls ; hence that grace of the Spanish women, which all recognize and none can describe, for mere form or feature does not explain it. I need not say that beneath a mantilla there are no curls ; nor need I add, that where neither bonnets nor caps are worn, and the head is always exposed, the hair is well kept. A Spanish lady remarked to me, that what struck her principally when she travelled in other countries, was the want of clean liness in the women's hair. It is always exposed, as hair was intended to be, to the air and wind, and it is every day in water, for they wet it before using the comb. The hair is dressed in two styles. One is called sarrano. The only explanation I could get for this name was, that sierra means mountain, and that the mountaineers dress in this way. But neither does it seem to be the style of the Sierra, nor does the word sarrano mean mountain : there is, indeed, no such word in Spanish.* * The word Sarra is given in Aldevete : he renders it prin cess ; also Sarria, Valencian for net. He derives both from the Hebrew."], [170, "150 ORIGIN OF THE WORD SARRANO. Sar and sarrano were Ph\u0153nician forms of Tyre * and Tyrian. The Tyrian, not the Greek or Roman, pronunciation would prevail in Spain and Africa. Columella, a Spaniard, says, \" Sarranam violam ; \" Silvius Italicus has \" Sarranum muricem ; \" Ennius, \" Sarranum ostrum ; \" consequently, \" Sarrano head dress \" means neither more nor less than \" Tyrian head-dress.\"f Such an etymology is in no ways far fetched. It is quite natural to look for a Tyrian mode of dressing the hair, under a covering of the head, described by Solomon, in a city built by the Tyrians, and from which you can perceive another city, which to this day bears the name of Sidon. Saint Augustine quotes it as an instance of the retentive memory of the people of his age, that the rustics in the neighbourhood of Carthage, when asked who and what they were, answered, \"We are from Canaan ; \" whence they had come one thousand and ninety years before, and after the name of Canaan had long been obliterated. Here is a head-dress with the name of Tyre, i. more than double that interval of years. In the \" Tyrian \" (Sarrano) style, the hair is divided over the forehead, turned back with an ample fold, * \" Quod nunc Tyrus dicitur olim Sarra vocabatur.\"\u2014 Scholi ast on Virgil. \" P\u0153nos Sarra oriundos.\" \u2014 Ennius. f \" Mantilla de Tiro \" may be from the same word.

There appears to be a reason why this style was called \" Tyrian.\" The Jewesses wear their hair bound upon the head in a very elaborate manner, with feathers, a cushion, and handkerchief, the Tyrian being all open and exposed. I find that I am concurrently using the past and present tenses, referring at one moment to the spot where I am ; at the next to the times of Hiram and Solomon ; but, in fact, they are so intermingled that it is impossible to dissever the Scriptural descriptions and the things themselves. The other style is mono; \u2014 and has also a foreign as sociation not, however, with Jerusalem, but with Paris, for it has been recently imitated there. The front hair, parted, is plaited on each side into one plait, then rolled as a wheel upon the temple, and fastened by a hair-pin. The back hair is gathered light, and secured behind by a riband. It is then divided into two parts and plaited ; these are turned up like a bow, and secured by the same riband. The bow (I mean of the hair) is then twisted, so as to spread on both sides, resting on the nape of the neck. It derives its name from mono, which is a large rose of variously-coloured riband, which is sometimes used to set it off. It is placed on the crown of the head : from it hang two tassels of gold or silver, lace or embroidery."], [172, "152 GOWNS, PETTICOATS, SHOES, AND. There is no gown of a piece ; the costume is in separate parts : the sleeves and body may be of any colour. They are, out of doors, covered by the mantilla ; like it, the petticoat is black : formerly it was not above two yards in width, and fell to the mi-jambe with weights round to keep it down. In a discussion on these subjects with Spanish ladies, an English gentleman maintained, on the authority of Murray's new \" Guide-Book,\" which had just come out, and which had been looked forward to with as much expectation as it produced disappointment, that only recently the ladies of Cadiz had taken to show their feet : that, \" formerly, they wore their petticoats so long that you could not tell if they had any feet at all.\" This produced an exclamation of astonishment and anger. A Gaditana mentioned that, having returned in 1823 from Paris to Madrid in the wake of the French army, bringing her mantilla with her, she sent for a milliner to order the other parts of the Spanish dress. The milliner told her that her Paris dresses would do, for that nothing else was worn ; on which she apostrophised the artiste thus : \u2014 \" Go out into the streets with mantilla and long petticoats ! \" Her astonishment equalled her indignation at seeing this hideous petticoat imposed on Spaniards-*, who, as she said, did not require it, not having \" feet an ell long.\" The petticoat of the peasants in Andalusia is yel low, of a homely but excellent woollen stuff, and bordered with red, the two colours which the Spanish"], [173, "SANDALS OF SPANISH WOMEN. 153 women most affect \u2014 the colours of their gorgeous standard, those of gold and blood. A Spanish woman is no less attentive to her foot and shoe* than to her hair : from below the saga comes forth the plump leg in its creaseless stocking. The impression that remained on me of Spain, having been there as a child, was a black lace-bedizened female figure, with a bunch of flowers on the head and on the foot, and a white satin shoe, cheapening cod in the fish-market at six in the morning. If the wise man was bewitched by the sight of the \" one eye,\" so was the paynim Holofernes \"ravished\" by the sight of Judith's sandal. But the sandal must not be taken for that thing which Abigails call by that name : it was not the service of riband that held the sole on, but the sole itself. Spain is still the country of the sandal : you may see it every day, and there is nothing that more recalls antiquity than the bands (stone-blue) by which it is secured round the ankle and foots * \" In doors they wear mules, or shoes very low, the rest of the leg being naked ; out of doors, and particularly in Anda lusia, they wear drawers, long and very neatly folded, to exhibit a fine leg, for their garments only come down to half the leg. They are very particular about their feet, and they have shoes of thin Morocco, very soft, embroidered in silk of different co lours. Tbey have for bracelets large manacles of gold and silver, so weighty that those of gold are worth a hundred ducats. They have similar ones above the ankle, which are round, and thicker than the wrist.\" \u2014 Maemol's Africa, vol. ii. p. 192. t The alpargata is not strictly the sandal, for the sole is of untanned leather, or a thick texture of hemp.

The old Spanish shoe is very low, and scarcely held at all at the heel : like the slipper of the East erns, it required the action of the toes to hold it on. The calf of the leg accordingly was full, because its muscles were called into play. So important is this to the grace and ease of the figure, that at Rome the models, male and female, lose their pension if they wear a shoe with a thick sole. There still wants something to complete the Spa nish costume, or, perhaps, I might say the Spanish woman \u2014 and that is the fan. Yet, how supply this want % at least, without herself \u2014 how convey her and it on paper? You might as well attempt to teach on paper how to roll a turban, make coffee, or hit the bull's-eye. The petticoat has two names, basquefia and saga. The latter recalls the sagum of the Greeks and Ro mans, which is derived from sagi or sogi of the Touaregs : sagum designated a web or mantle. How it has come to be a petticoat I shall presently explain. The sleeves, mangos, are tight to the arm, and buttoned up the fore-arm, not by button-holes in the stuff, but in the Eastern manner, with loops. The but tons are gold filigree, which we call Maltese : they are used in large numbers for ornamenting the maja dress.

A scarf is fast ened above the dress, which comes up behind, is secured upon the shoulders by clasps, and then brought down in front. There is something ap proaching to this worn by the women in Morocco. The buckles and clasps on the shoulders are fre quently mentioned in the Old Testament. The parts of the dress in which colour is allowed are the body and the sleeves, which, when out of doors, are shrouded by the mantilla. The dress for the streets is black, and invariably black ; while the men display the most gaudy and variegated colours. The avanico is used ceremoniously and socially : \u2014 in the first place, it is stiffly and demurely restricted to its legitimate end. When it enters common life, held firmly, yet freely between the fingers and the ball of the hand, it serves as an extension of it, feathered to flout the air. The ordinary fan practice is to throw the hand outwards while letting go one side of the fan ; then turning the hand inwards to recover it by a jerk. If we had no fans in Europe there would be less difficulty in describing, because our imagination would be free and at work. Having fans, and using them to disturb the air, we have settled notions of them ; and when we hear what a Spanish fan can ac complish, we conclude that there is a code of signals \u2014 some sort of constructive slang imparted to the initi ated.

This is a peculiarity for which no age and no race afford a parallel. Take Cherokee or ancient Egyptian, Hindoo, Athenian, Hottentot, or Kamschatdale, you will not find one who has dressed his body according to the motions of the sun and earth ; or held a checked waist coat, or a close-bodied gown as appropriate at one hour and inappropriate at another. When dress was asso ciated with respect, change either by the hour or month was impossible : the man was then more than the food and the body \u2014 than the raiment ; \u2014 change could- only become habitual where such feelings were dead ; and then dress, escaping from the guidance of taste, became the trappings of vanity. This evening dress of Europe is the common in-door dress, slightly disfigured, of the Spanish lady. The veil and fan, the chief adornment of the female costume, are from Spain ; so also is that richest and most distinguishing of its materials, lace. Barbara of Brabant has received the credit of the discovery ; but her share can extend no further than to the mode of working in flax. The texture in silk and cotton must have been carried thither by the Spaniards.

In this conclusion, I was confirmed by finding in Barbary the term Guipobr. It is used by the Jews for the festival of atonement, when they wear white mantles in the synagogue, with the fringes in open embroidery. The name of the country was given to the texture.

But there was an ancient festival in Spain on the occasion of the child cutting its teeth, which was known to the Christians under the name of Dentilia.* Such would be a fitting time for the display of this finery. Whoever has seen the festival of Corpus Christi in Spain, or Portugal, will understand how natural it was to give the name ; for on it all the procession, or at least all the public functionaries to this day, wear scarfs of lace over their uni forms. The blonde is made on the frame. The common lace, which is used as seams and edging, is made with the crochet, which is as familiar in the hands of every Moor, as formerly the cronag in those of the Highland Methodique is mentioned a work published in 1587, being a translation and a third edition of Frederick de Vinciolo Venil\u00e6ri, of which the title is \" Le Reseau premier et la point coupe et locis de plusieurs beaux et differens pour traicts de reseaux de point de cote avec le nombre de mailles, chose non encore vue ni in ventee.\" The engravings seem to represent two kinds of lace, figures forming a toile without field, i. e. guypure ; the other figures on a square thick-set ground or net work as in Valen ciennes appliqu6es.

In the same way, may yet be seen Highland hose, and formerly the trews. The Shetland shawl still bears testimony to the recorded beauty of the manufactures of the Hebrides, in early times ; and in Barbary \u2014 although I know not that the art is still preserved \u2014 magnificent pieces of Guypoor come from time to time to light. One was brought me at Tetuan three yards and a half in length, and above a yard in width. The supposed invention, therefore, of lace-making in the Low Countries, must be understood merely as that of a new process, viz., the bobbins, pins, and cushion, by which a new variety was obtained, and which has its beauty and its facility ; but which can stand no comparison with the original, which it has caused to fall into disuse ; and now that the taste for it is revived, the art is lost. While the Spanish female costume is unques tionably the most beautiful in Europe, it would thus appear to be at the same time a valuable historical monument. Nor is its antiquarian interest limited to the Peninsula : it carries us back to the land and the people, which, of all others, possess claims on the affections, and merit the study of Christendom.

We have besides proof that black was the colour of Spain twelve hun dred years before the invasion of the Saracens : they wear \"black sayas,\" says the Greek geographer.

But beyond the zone of white, there is another zone of black, or of mixed black and white. A portion of the Tuarisks, who occupy the vast tract of Africa between the equator and the habitable portions upon the coast, wear the black sulam with black cowl,* a black turban rolled round, not the head only, but the face, the neck, and body, so as to leave exposed alone their black, small, sparkling eyes. The mantilla is generally considered a relic of Mus sulman usages, but the women in Morocco do not now wear the veil. There, men and women have one and the same dress : they wear it in the same manner over the head, the only difference being, that the women keep it closer drawn. The first clothing must have been the single garment, such as we see it in Africa still. Noble as it is simple, it conforms itself to every use in the adaptation, and displays every grace in the adjustment of its folds. It was subsequently divided and cut up into distinct parts or coverings ; and dress became a set of integuments for casing the limbs, rather than for clothing the body. The veil cannot, therefore, be known where the original vesture remains in use. The haik, as worn by the Jewesses, is the saya manta. It is of enormous dimensions ; from one and * May not this be tbe mantle introduced by Caracalla into Rome, and from which he derived the soubriquet by which posterity has known him, Cara Cowl, or black hood 1"], [183, "THE HAiK, AS WORN BY JEWESSES. 163 a half to two yards wide, and from six to eight long.* It comes four times round the body, one of the turns being measured by the outstretched arms to form the hood. The Jewesses double two yards and a half, one part longer than the other, so as to serve, when wrapped round the waist, for a petticoat ; folds to give play to the limbs are added at one side, and secured by a large pin ; a turn is then taken with the whole haik round the waist, and the remainder is brought from behind over the head and shoulders. They of course wore it so in Spain.f For the source of peculiarities in Spain it is na tural that we should look to Morocco; not so for the origin of a costume apparently as different in form as remote in situation \u2014 the Highland garb ; yet that it does come from the same stock is indu bitable.

The name of the place is curious. + This monstrous solecism of the jacket, in tartan, may be observed in Wilkie's picture of George IV., at Holyrood House."], [185, "165 AND HIGHLAND GARB. and the haik the peculiarity of colour is in like manner reserved : brechan feil is the name of the Highland garb, and identical with saya manta. Thus, in the haik still lives the common parent of the costume of the Highland clansmen and the Spanish lady : in the one case the name has descended on the covering of the shoulders (brechan,* Gaelic), in the other (saya) in that of the legs. It is curious that the old name is given in Spain to the petticoat of the women ; in England to the breeches of the men. In the mountains between Baeza and Guadix, which were the last refuge of the Moors, I have seen the manta worn by the men, corresponding in texture exactly with the haik worn by the Arab women in the tents, which are sometimes striped in colours : the colours in like manner being pure, and of course rich and brilliant, are dyed at home. -Sometimes the stripes are crossed, which is not the practice in Barbary. The first I saw was so like a Scotch plaid, that, until I examined it, I took it for a piece of English manufacture. * Tartan is the English for Brechan. It is generally sup posed to be Gaelic, but it is not so : it seems originally to have signified shot colours, which always appear in the tartan from the crossings of the colours. It has by some been derived from Tyre tint. The Brechan or Tartan is the set of each clan. The English confound Tartan and plaid, and speak barbarously of a \" plaid waistcoat,\" when they mean a tartan waistcoat. The plaid is in Gaelic a shepherd's mantle, but is never used for the Brechan mantle, or \" battle colours.\" It may be derived from BnrXoihov (Pollux vii. 49), a name given by the Greeks to a mantle which was supposed to be worn double."], [186, "166 MOORISH AND HIGHLAND COSTUME. The manta or plaid of the shepherd is doubled, and stitched at one end to serve as a hood, just as our Highlanders do, to put the feet in at night, or to use as a hood or as a bag. In this part of Spain the men wear large white drawers, which leave the knee bare, and appear like a white kilt. The medias, like the Scotch hose, are bound below the knee, and are sometimes of leather like those the Moors use for riding. To the plaid and tartan, to the facsimile of the kilt and hose, they add the strathspey tune, and the reel step, and \" set,\" to each other. Seeing them footing it toe and heel, smacking fingers, clap ping hands, shouting and wheeling, I was carried at once to the glens and straths of the North. While this merriment was in progress, several carts stopped. These carts had two wheels and two horses, the pole resting on their necks. It was the ancient chariot. In the dialect of the country they are called Elheudi, pure Arabic for the Jewish. Festivals or solemnities, meetings beyond the com monplaces of ordinary intercourse, are required from time to time to quicken the spirit of a people, and to refresh and preserve its costume. When, in the Highlands, you inquire the date of the disuse of tartan kilt and arms, they will reckon back to the time when they were last worn, \"at church.\" Yet our clergy have never cultured the Celtic spirit, and have held the trappings of our race but as pagan emblems, dis loyal badges, or mundane toys.

The men, when they enter the circus, the women when they pass the porch, drop the millinery and tailoring of Paris. What the bull-ring is for the one, the church is for the other ; from the one, is inseparable the majo dress, from the other, the saya manta. The wearing the mantilla at church, I have heard attributed to the despotic power of the priests over the women: \u2014 the chulos of the bull-ring, there exer cise equal despotism over the men. Blanco White narrates that during the plague at Seville, and when religious fervour was, in consequence, at its height, a priest at Alcala \" claimed and exercised a right to exclude from church such females as by a showy dress were apt to disturb the abstracted yet susceptible minds of the clergy. It should be observed, by the way, that as the walking dress of the Spanish females absolutely precludes immodesty, the conduct of this religious madman admits of no excuse or palliation. Yet this is so far from being a singular instance, that what sumptuary laws would never be able to accom plish, the rude and insolent zeal of a few priests has fully obtained in every part of Spain. Our females, especially those of the better classes, never venture to church in any dress but such as habit has made familiar to the, eyes of the zealots.\" I was present at the festival of the patron saints"], [188, "168 SPANISH DEGENERACY IN of the place, and, throughout the whole population, saw not one coloured dress or one bonnet. The man tilla was worn in deference to the priests, who are to-day as powerful as they ever have been, and as despotic as they could ever wish to be. A more perfect contrast there cannot be than between the cathedral and a fashionable tertulia. In the former nothing is to be seen but the black and glittering silk and the rich blonde : at the other no trace of Spain \u2014 not even in the music or the dances \u2014 no mantilla, no bolero, no fandango, no guitar, no castanet \u2014 nothing but the unmeaning quadrille, the shuffling heedless step, the Paris millinery, the false tints and kaleidoscope patterns : \u2014 everything common place and vulgar, or rather the bad imitation of vulgarity and commonplace.

A flag designates and de fies, a costume ennobles and preserves. A flag has come by accident, costume is the produce of a people's taste. The Medes had a dress ; the Persians, the Ro mans, the Egyptians had each a dress. To say, then, a dress, is to say a people. A costume is to a people like its mountains, its floods, and its lakes. The costume of its land and its fathers has been to every noble people like their tongue, their fame, their precepts, and their laws ; in independence, giv ing dignity ; in chains, none. The tyrant and the patriot alike know its worth. The wandering Israel ite for two thousand years, has worn, concealed on his person, the proscribed garb of Jud\u00e6a \u2014 a mystic shred, the emblem and promise of restoration. So late as the middle of the last century, the Parliament of England did not conceive its dominion secure until it had put down the Highland dress. The last in Europe to retain one, the Spaniard has yet a costume. He is in the act of surrendering it, yet no foreign hordes cover the Peninsula and hunt down its inhabitants. Itself, with unnatural hands, tears it off and casts it away, and adopts in lieu of it a foreign garb \u2014 which, indeed, is no garb \u2014 for it belongs to no people, furnished forth not by a combination of the tastes of all the people of Europe, but by a concentration of their vulgarism.

The demeanour of men towards women could not fail to engage attention in the birthplace of chivalry, as among the orientals men and women, salute in the same manner. It was some time before I could have said, \" The women in Spain do not curtsey ; * yet I should have been shocked to see a Spanish lady do so. I have been looking over a book en titled, \" Travels in the land of Monkeys,\" meaning England and France. It is uncertain whether the work is originally Spanish or Italian.

There is nothing so good that it may not be perverted, and the best then becomes the worst. Curtseying is now respectable because men have taken to nodding, and poking their hat with the forefinger. How great would their sur prise be, if they heard that the dominion of the world may hinge on a form of salutation. \"Lan guage,\" said Ali, \" is the mirror of the understand ing ; manners, of the man.\" Bacon tells us that \"Reason may affect the judgment, interest the con duct, but manners alone touch the heart.\" It is by manners that the teaching of the child begins before he has learnt his letters. Manners are the curb on the passions. They are the guide of life from the cradle to the tomb, and by them you judge of the nation as well as of the man. A people's history is written in a salutation. Alwakide, in the early days of Islam, records as an event, that a man re ceiving sentence of death had not saluted the judge. In the secluded places of Spain, even yet, on the bell tolling at \" oration,\" whoever is walking, stops ; who ever is seated, rises ; the prayer concluded, each turns round and salutes those around him.

Unlike the Eastern, the Spaniard has the word \" thanks ; \" but it is not his sole resource in the embarrassment occasioned among some nations by every act or speech of civility. When one Spaniard says to another, \" Do you please to eat with me 1 \" the other does not say, \" No, I thank you ; \" but, \" may it do you good.\" When he says, \" This house is at your disposal,\" the answer is not, \" I thank you,\" or \"I am much obliged to you,\" but \"You know me to serve you.\" Civility and ceremony do not belong to particular classes.

Two human beings do not require an introduction to know each other ; they never pass without salutation. No one breaks bread in the presence of another, whatever the difference of rank, without an invitation to partake. The title of the pastrycook on his sign-board is no other than that of the king. The master is as courtier-like to his servant as to his equal. The beggar is not turned away, even from the door of a tavern, and when he is refused by a prince, it is with the words, \" Pardon me, brother.\" \" To the honour of Spain,\" says even Borrow, \" be it spoken, it is one of the few countries in Europe where poverty is never insulted, nor looked on with contempt.

If Spain produces less from her soil than any other country of Europe, the Spaniard enjoys a larger share, and more equable distribution of the produce than any other people. It may not be uninteresting to place beside this a passage descriptive of the Moors : it speaks of the law, but the remark is prompted by the practice. \" The acts of common charity or casual alms are almost of injurious obligation on a Mussulman ; he dares not sit down to dinner without inviting those who are near him to partake of it, of whatever condition or religion they may be, and he cannot refuse assistance to any poor person who may apply to him, if he have the means. Hospitality is to be exercised towards every one who claims it,* without regard to religion.\" \u2014 Ali Bey's travels, i. 95. It would require no further evidence than this, that in Spain is to be found domestic affection, attachment of servants and master, charitable dispo sitions, tenderness for the afflicted, and aid for the necessitous.

The mere habit of politeness is a possession greater than all a people has besides, and for the want of which there is no compensation ; and that tone of voice, and those forms of address which in individuals are the sign of proper bringing up, are to a nation the source and stay of their good order and well-being. In Spain the term \" politico \" is still synonymous with polite. They have dignity, which we take for pride, and none of our so-called ease, which to them is vulgarity. Therefore did they beat France when all Europe was at her feet, and therefore will Spain live on when we shall have passed away \u2014 unless, indeed, we live long enough to teach them our civility.

Marius, Pompey, Napoleon, failed through their misjudgment of Spain : by apprehending her, C\u00e6sar won the diadem, Scipio saved his country, and Wellesley Europe. Whenever Europeans have judged of Spain, they have been at fault ; whenever they have acted upon her, they have failed ; whenever they have adminis tered nostrums to her, she has suffered. Madrid presents the features of European governments : Spain preserves the character of the Moorish people\u2014 the character that enabled them to expel the Moors, in after times the English, and more recently the French ; and the capital is actually in arms against the spirit of the age. The familiar forms we see at Madrid, the glibness with which the diplomatist speaks of this thing and that, this party and that, paves the way to plans and schemes ; \u2014 then intervenes the unknown element, the spirit of the Spanish people, and capsizes all the plots. If Europe is the source of the evils of Spain, so is Spain the source of the dangers of Europe.. As she cannot leave our follies alone until she be wise, so can we not leave her affairs alone till we be honest.

If you ask a Spaniard your way, he will not be content with pointing it out to you : he will generally accompany you. If you exceed the strict bounds of civility, you lay him under an obliga tion ; if you do less, you have done him a wrong, which as surely he will remember. A little kindness goes a great way ; and the worst of injuries is mistrust. An English merchant in this neighbourhood, having no money in his pocket, gave a handful of cigars to a beggar : the poorest Spaniard will be more gratified with a cigar than with money, as it is a compliment. Three years afterwards, this merchant was seized near his country-house by a band of robbers. While they were settling his ransom, they were joined by an ab sent comrade, who instantly dismounted and, ap proaching the Englishman, saluted him, and asked if he did not remember having given at such a place and time a handful of cigars to a beggar ; then turning to his comrades he said, \" This is my benefactor \u2014 whoever lays a hand on him lays it on me.\" On turning over the pages of a writer on Spain, I am reminded that the offer of the house is nothing more -than an evidence of Spanish hollowness and in sincerity. The offer of the house is a sign of civility, just as much as the words, \" Your obedient humble servant,\" and these words are just as much an evidence of our insincerity as the \" offer of the house.\" It is the same thing with the offer of pot-luck.

But when the answer is, \" No se meta usted in eso,\" \" Do not trouble yourself N 2"], [200, "180 EASTERN HOSPITALITY. in that matter,\" by which is implied that no engage ment stands in the way, the offer is then again re peated and accepted. That there should be three questions put and answered, in reference to an invita tion to dinner, will be construed into an evidence of a want of hospitality. Are we a people to judge of hos pitality 1 A very hospitable person (in our way) I had once the misfortune to arouse to fierce indignation by selecting this term to show the perversion, in mo dern idioms, of classical terms, we applying the Latin word to a repast from which are excluded those to whom the Roman hospitality was offered \u2014 the poor and hungry. Those who have travelled in the East will surely not say that the people of the East are inhospitable ; yet the people of the East never invite you to dinner. In fact, hospitality is incompatible with invitations to dinner. Where every one is welcome, it is impossible that you should invite. You may invite a person for the sake of his company, and coming to you at the time of meals, he may eat with you ; but he is not invited for the purpose of eating. The meal offered is, in fact, an obligation conferred, and must be felt as such by a person of delicacy, and will be accepted with the same measure as any other favour. Is not this the interpretation of the contempt of the Romans for the Parasites or the Dinner-hunters. In one of the Dialogues of Xenophon the difference is illustrated. Socrates being invited to supper, at first refuses, and only accepts after a due reluctance on his part, and as"], [201, "HOSPITALITY ENJOINED BY SCRIPTURE. 181 due a persistence on the part of Amphytria, \u2014 Xenophon taking care to point out that he had acted in this respect properly.

A word is even misused with impunity, and here the mistake of a Latin term covers the perversion of a Christian maxim. The hospitality of the Romans was that of Jud\u00e6a. The manners of Jud\u00e6a are the matrix of Christianity. When Christ sent forth the seventy, he told them to carry no scrip, and to make no pro vision. Wherever they first entered (were received) there should they abide. They were to eat what was set before them (given them). Hospitality was the condition of the reception of the Gospel : shall it be needless for, or incompatible with, its maintenance % Those who, in Jewish Canaan or Jud\u00e6a, had no place where to lay their head, shook off the dust from their feet, in testimony against those who received them not. In Christian England, the Apostles of the Saviour would be sent to the workhouse or put upon the treadmill. I was here interrupted by a visit from a French merchant.

A great traffic had been carried on through the Basque provinces, during the Continental blockade : no books were kept ; the recovery of debts by legal process was impossible ; yet was it distin guished by the most perfect confidence, and entire absence of failures or embezzlement. The statement was subsequently confirmed by Mr. George Jones, of Manchester, who managed the largest English concern in the Basque provinces during the war. He had no clerks. The goods were disembarked and put in warehouses. He could keep no regular ac counts. The muleteers came themselves to get the bales, and all he could do was, to tell them what the bales contained, and to receive their own note of what they had taken in an amount of 300,000.?., and there was but one parcel missing. Several years afterwards, a priest brought him fifty dollars, which was the value of the missing bale of goods, saying, \" Take that and ask no questions.\" My visitor related to me the following anecdote : \u2014 A French merchant from Bordeaux, who had a house at Barcelona, where he resided, received, in the course of business, a large sum of money from a Spaniard at a time when he was much embarrassed in his affairs ; he was therefore unwilling to receive the money, and yet fearful to refuse it, lest his credit should be shaken. Shortly afterwards, he failed and absconded. His cre ditor traced him to Gibraltar and thence to Cadiz. There he found him lying sick, without attendants, in"], [203, "THE FRENCH MERCHANT AND THE SPANIARD. 183 a garret. On entering the room, the Spaniard sternly demanded his debtor s books. Receiving them, he. sat himself down and spent several hours examining them, referring to the Frenchman merely upon points where he wanted information. When he had completed his inves tigation he returned the books without comment, and departed. Shortly afterwards he returned, accompanied by a physician, and had his debtor removed to a com fortable apartment, and then addressed him thus : \" I am satisfied that you have not been guilty of fraud ; but you have done me a great wrong : had you been frank, I should have enabled you to hold your ground. Now that we are in the same boat, let me know how much will enable you to re-commence business.\" The sum being specified, he said, \"Well, you shall have it upon the condition that you pledge me your word of honour that you will not leave Spain without my permission.\" The debtor was about to pour forth expressions of gratitude, when his creditor stopped him : \" It is you,\" said he, \" who have rendered me a service ;\" and, unbuttoning his coat, showed him a brace of pistols, adding, \" One of these was for my self.\" My informant concluded : \" I am the man, and it happened under this roof.\" Those who come to Spain to see something that belongs to her, would not wish her peculiarities to be diminished ; those who wish to find in Spain what they can have in Paris or in London, had better stay away.

There is no difficulty in learning half-a-dozen different lan guages ; but you could not learn one if you jumbled in every sentence the words of your own tongue, or converted the foreign one into your own syntax.

This character of interest scarcely, indeed, presents itself amongst the people of Europe, on the one hand from their close resemblance, and on the other from the extinction of habits and traditional thoughts ; but when you get into Spain, there it does present itself to whoever will discriminate it ; the word of every peasant is not a reverberation of a proposition, but a"], [205, "HOW BEST TO DO SO. 185 record of centuries. To one who feels this, Spain will present the most interesting field of travel in Europe ; to one who does not, the most gratifying. An English resident at Gibraltar told me that, by following a certain rule, he found travelling in Spain very agreeable, and recommended it to my adoption. He said, \" I always address a Spanish peasant as if he were my equal.\" \" I do not require,\" I replied, \" your rule, for I feel myself honoured whenever a Spanish peasant condescends to speak to me.\" There is, however, a rule not only by which to make travelling pleasant, but to make life itself so, and that is, to seek for and see in others only what is good and profitable, in order to correct, or, at least, comprehend, that in ourselves which is useless or faulty ; but this is not a rule. Another weakness is the idea of being able to rate enjoyments or estimate hardships. It is not merely that the hardships and enjoyments are not equal in degree when similar in character, but very often they are reversed. A German coming to England will complain of the misery of hard beds.

Those who have lived in Scotland will understand the first, those who have lived in the East will apprehend the second. In regard to cookery, costume, and forms of so ciety, we have habits formed ; and, surely, he is an unreasoning being who proceeds by means of those habits to estimate the habits of other nations : the consequence of attempting to do so is a vague un certainty of spirit, which concentrates itself in his eye wherein he looks. The useful traveller and the profitable observer will commence by a process the very opposite.

We have in vain attempted to imi tate them. They retain this value although Africa is deluged with glass from every work-shop in Europe. The fact is of importance, as bearing on traffic, which Herodotus makes the Carthaginians carry on, and which moderns dispute.

When Pliny wrote there were still histories of Tyre extant ; still traditions as well as interpreta- tions of the hieroglyphics. It is difficult to imagine that if it had been Egyptian, it should have been given to any other people ; and, if not Tyrian, claimed by and surrendered to them. Even if communicated to the Egyptians at the period when it figures on their walls, it may have been for many previous centuries the exclusive possession of Tyre, for the Ph\u0153nicians were of equal date with the Egyptians.\"\" The monuments of Egypt were not pictures of common things, but records of extraordinary ones. They were designed to illustrate the lives of kings and heroes ; representing their triumphal entries ; their trophies ; the tribute offered ; the captives brought home ; the arts they introduced ; the inventions and incidents of their time. We have in them a few repetitions : elephants are there : they are seen but once ; a cart but once ; brick-making once ; glass-blowing once, and that is in the reign of Sesu Sesen, consequently I will not say that this record proves, but that it at least suggests, that up to that time the manufacture was unknown in Egypt. The representation is not, however, of glass- making; it is of blowing only: no where is glass-mak ing seen. If the Egyptians had the art of blowing glass only, they must have imported the raw material. * Josephus, scouting the arrogance of the Greeks, who might be said \" to be of yesterday,\" in presuming to speak of Jewish history, refers them to the \" Ph\u0153nicians and Egyptians.\""], [213, "NOT BY EGYPTIANS. 193 The monument of Carnac enumerates among the tribute paid to Tathmes IIL, \" ingots of enamel ;\" and this tribute was paid four hundred years after the glass-blowing figures on the walls. The material for glass abounded in Egypt. They were dexterous in preparing mineral compounds for colouring : had they understood the manufacture they would not have im ported it ; and had the manufacture been known, we should have seen it figured with the blowing. But the Egyptians, having learnt the art of blowing, would desire to have the unmanufactured material in order to adapt it to their own fashions. This is entirely confirmed by the description given by the Egyptian priests to Herodotus ; for it must be after them that he designates the ornaments of the sacred crocodiles (which we know to be glass), \\i6a,m -ypra, fused stones. This tribute came from \"Maharama,\" or Mesopo tamia, in the first cities of which the Ph\u0153nicians had establishments. Having set aside the claims put in for Egypt, no other people making any, I have, I think, restored the invention to the Ph\u0153nicians. A new claim has now been set up for the Assyrians, according to Mr. Layard. \" They had acquired the art of making glass.

There may be more in the association than we have yet discovered. Pliny mentions the magnet as used in the preparation of glass.

A few glass-houses, according to our notion, would not suffice to compel an exchange of the metal of Ogg, and the beasts of Deden, and the pearls of Chittim, and the gold of Tarshish. The wares consisted in the dye itself which she extracted from the shells of her own coast, and from that portion of the coast of Africa, where they were in like manner found, and the drops of glass equivalent to gems, to prepare which a few hands sufficed, and on which the profits must have exceeded all calculation.-1- * Mvp' ayovTts advppara urjl fieWaivy.

The Pacific was peopled without it. Within the Mediterranean the land served to guide, weather shores to protect. These, and the tides, aided the navigator all round Europe. The monsoons wafted him along on the Indian Ocean. But there was one voyage, which, with none of these aids, the Ph\u0153ni cians, and they alone of all antiquity performed, \u2014 that of Western Africa. It was upon that coast, and in sight of its insurmountable natural difficulties, that the idea, here developed, first occurred to me.

The place, the inventor, the precise date are all known ; and though by one section of literary men the honour is referred to China, and by another, indications of some sort of compass are admitted elsewhere, and at anterior dates, still the compass in its present shape, and in its practical use, is next to universally attributed to Flavio de Gioja, of Amalphi, in the year 1302.

To the latter people it owed the lead it took in instruction and navigation. Centuries and generations before Flavio de Gioja, the needle was known at Amalphi.

Now, our instrument offered intrinsic evidence of a parentage wholly distinct from the Chinese. The north is the leading point. The axis of the globe cut at right angles by the equator, gives the four points which we term cardinal, which are then subdivided into eight, sixteen, and thirty-two (the latter appears to be comparatively modern). These constitute the points which serve the mariner, and are employed in directing the course of the vessel and steering it. The circle is then divided, according to the astronomic measurement of the globe, into 360 degrees. These Points and Degrees are figured on a card affixed to the needle, and revolving with it on a pivot, so that the helmsman has the circle of the earth before him, and has to bring the vessel's head (marked by a line in the cup in which the card and needle float) to that point of the circle towards which he is directed to steer. In every respect, save the polarity of the needle, the Chinese compass differs. The south, taking the negative for the positive polarity, is made the leading point : it is not marked by any mouassola or figure, but painted red.

The astronomic degrees on the outer circle are not equal to one another, and amount to about three hundred and eighty. Although the needle revolves, it is not on a pivot, but on a point which, like the letter t, descends into the wood of the box, and there turns in a socket. No card is affixed on it : it tra verses as an index, pointing to the scale of the circle traced on the box.

Thus, the Chinese compass differs from ours toto c\u0153lo, there not being a single point in which, even by accident, we have hit upon the same method. A junk and a Ph\u0153nician galley, or an English collier, are not more dissimilar: both sail the seas, and both direct the ship \u2014 there all resemblance begins and ends. The Chinese instrument had been used on land for many centuries before the Christian era. It had been adopted in navigation at least in the third century of our era. It existed, therefore, in the form in which we now see it, long antecedent to its use in the West. It is as serviceable as ours for every purpose of naviga- tion. Why should we have reversed the whole order 1 How could we have done so with that uniformity which prevails in all the countries of the West ? But there is still, if possible, a stronger argument. The needle, when first used by the Arabs, received only a temporary polarity ; the Chinese give to theirs Vi permanent polarity. The former process was, there- fore, a step in the discovery : had it been borrowed they would have at once used the perfect method. The process is thus described in 1242 by Boulak Kibdjaki. \" They take a cup of water, which they shelter from the wind ; they then take a needle, which they fix in a peg of wood (reed), or a straw, so as to form a cross. They then take the magnes and turn round for some"], [241, "ARABIAN AND CHINESE NEEDLE. 221 time above the cup, moving from left to right, the needle following. They then withdraw the magnes, after which the needle stands still and points north and south.\" * This description, confirmed by the authorities cited below, can leave no doubt that we have arrived at the same end as the Chinese by a different road. The invention of Flavio di Gioja may have consisted in giving to the needle permanent polarity : the next step would be of course to fix it on a pivot, which again differs from the Chinese. I beg particular attention to this manner of using the instrument by the Arabs, as by it we shall be subsequently enabled to interpret the Greek myths. * The passage of Brunetto Latini [Lib. du Tresor, MSS. du Roi, No. 7609), is too well known to quote ; but I subjoin a curious fragment of a letter, attributed to him, which was pub lished in the \" Monthly Review\" of June, 1802. It appears to me to be of indubitable authenticity. He is describing the wonders shown him by Roger Bacon, who was a disciple of the Arabs, and had studied at Cordova, like Gerbert, Abelard, and all the distinguished men of the period: \u2014 \"La magnete pierre laide et noire, ob el fer volontiers se joint, Ion touche ob une aiguillet et en festue Ion fischie (fix it on a piece of reed); puis Ion mette en laigue (float it on the water) et se tient dessus, et la pointe se torne contre l'estoille : quand la nuit fut tene brous, et Ion ne voie estoille ni lune, poet li mariner tenir droite voie.\" \"Acus ferrea, postquam adamantem contigerit, ad stellam septentrionalem, qu\u00e6, velut axis firmamenti, aliis vergentibus, non movetur, semper convertitur, unde valde necessarius est navi gantibus in mari.\" \u2014 Jac. de Vit.

The Arabs shut themselves out as the inventors \u2014 we have shut out the Chinese. The distribution of the circle must have come to the Arabs, together with the magnet and needle : it could only come from ancient augury. The officer and priest, whose title has been given to the science, marked out all bounds for consecration, building, or other purposes, and commenced by drawing, on the spot where he stood, the line of the axis of the globe, the cardo crossing it by the synatorial or decumonus. In the augurial operations the terrestrial and celestial globes were made the counterparts of each other, and the heavens were distributed into sixteen parts.* Divination was rather ars Etrusca, and we are in the habit of referring its source to that people ; but the Etruscans had no compass. Divination was no more original in Etruria than in Rome.

As in the West, those ceremonies in which religion was united with science, and which therefore marked, not as they would with us, ignorance and superstition, * Univ. Hist. vol. xviii. p. 213.

Though dim the echoes (trxoruml uxoai) that have been handed down to us, we still recognise the voice and name of the mas ters of whom Abraham was the disciple. In Europe, letters were Ph\u0153nician; in the East, the learned were Sabeans. Rome got her ceremonies from Cere. The Cerethims were Sabeans. From the Sabeans the Mussulman had his Rekaat ; the Polytheist his In cense; the Jew his Teraphim. Therefore the Ars Etrusca was derived from the early seats of the Ph\u0153nicians. After fruitless attempts to discover the etymology of cardo* it occurred to me that as the other names of winds, and, consequently, of the points of the compass, had been derived from those of the countries across which they blew,f so might this be a geographic term, and might be found to the north of Sabea or Chald\u00e6a.

The ends were attained by both ; the means they used were wholly different, both belonging to the earliest constituted societies, both from periods antecedent to history, navigating the Indian ocean. They alone construct ing vessels of large burthen, alone possessing that navigation. The word \" Ph\u0153nician,\" is a great stumbling-block in these inquiries. There was no people so called. It is a word of Greek invention f and construction. As there were Carthaginians or inhabitants of Car thage, so were there inhabitants of Tyre, and inhabi tants of Sidon. The Cerathians, who occupied the adjoining territory, were simply \" citizens,\" as distin guished from the \" Nomades,\" or \" Skenites,\" and * Four thousand years ago the polar star was a Draconis.

The Greeks so called them as coming from the Red Sea. In the time of Alexander, the Greeks found that they were also settled on the Persian Gulf, and that there was the metropolis, of which the Sidon and the Tyre of Syria were the daughters, as of these in subsequent times another progeny was to be found in Leptis, Utica ; Carthage, Carthagena ; Troy on the Scamander, and Tor in Devonshire. For the word Ph\u0153nician we must then substitute, or by it we must understand, \"Sea-faring Arab.\" The tribe which took to these enterprises, had of course its early establishments on the Red Sea, the southern shores of Arabia, the Persian Gulf, that is, on Arabian soil, then it would reach to the Persian and Abys sinian coasts. The next stage would be the shores of the Mediterranean. They would construct on that sea such vessels as those with which they navi gated the Indian Ocean, and are thus celebrated by the Greeks as the inventors of ships. There is therefore no difficulty in placing the Ph\u0153nicians, in so far as antiquity is concerned, on a level with the Chinese, and in so far as geography is in question, on the same field of navigation and commerce. Yet the two systems are as opposite as it is possible for the imagination of man to con ceive. Before the arrival of the Chinese junk, had any one * From DinS perazoth, dwellers in unwalled villages.

As in naval architecture neither of the styles could have been copied, and each must have been original, \u2014 so is it with their compasses ; neither could have been copied from the other, and the invention must have been in each case separately made. A secret such as this could be preserved and trans mitted only by constant use. How then could it have come from Ph\u0153nicia to us ? Augury had been swept away from the face of the earth. A thousand years had run their course between the fall of Tyre and the maritime enterprises of the Saracens. Thirty generations had gone to the tomb. The difficulty I fully admit and feel. I oppose to it the intrinsic evidence offered by the instrument, and the impossibility of referring it to any other race, Chinese, Mussulman, Arabs, Hindoos, or to the systems of modern Europe. That it must have passed, I contend ; how it passed is another matter. The knowledge of the road is no point of my argument: \u2014 nevertheless, I think I have found the clue.

This voyage, immense as it was, did not therefore necessitate any venturesome entrance into the open sea \u2014 they (Mediterranean) Sea, and so to return into Egypt. The Ph\u0153- nicians consequently, having departed out of the Erythraean sea, proceeded on their voyage in the Southern Sea : when it was autumn, they would push ashore, and, sowing the land, whatever might be the part of Lybia they had reached, await there till the harvest time : having reaped their corn they continued their voyage. Thus, after the lapse of two years, and passing through the Pillars of Hercules in the third, they came back into Egypt, and stated what is not credible to me, but may be so, perhaps, to others, \u2014 namely, that in their circumnavigation of Libya, they had the sun upon the right hand.\" \u2014 Heeeen. ii. c. 44."], [267, "THE OPINIONS OF HEEREN. 247 needed not to have lost sight of the land even for a day.

There is no contradiction between the two propositions. Such difficulties surround, and such dangers attend that navigation, that I do not understand how we to-day could navigate that coast, were the magnetic needle to lose its virtue. Impelled by the eddy from America, the Atlantic draws down the African shore. There is below Mogadore a night breeze from the sea ; the land is low, and stretches in a line of sand banks or breakers. There are no inlets and no shelter, and certain destruction awaits the mariner a substitute for it, in stretching from coast lo coast into the most distant regions. The long series of centuries during which they were exclusively the masters of the seas, gave them sufficient time to make this gradual progress, which perhaps was the more regular and certain in proportion to the time it occupied.

It lies all along the course of the voyage ; it presents certain destruction to the vessel, and if evitable death, inevitable slavery to the crew.

A Heaven of pale blue is reflected in the Atlantic ; there is not a speck above nor a breath below ; there is nothing that tells of Atlas or of Africa \u2014 no cloud capped and snow-clad peaks overshadowing the ocean, or pillaring the sky. The land is low and tame ; but on nearing it along the water's edge, a fast-set fence of breakers appears, which would crush in an instant the Baron Renfrew, or Ptolemy Philopator's fifty decker : in memory of such incidents, no doubt, Ant\u00e6us honoured Neptune with a temple of human heads. These horrid fangs, now covered with foam and now left bare, might well suggest the idea of a dra gon-guarded land. Calm as it is, at a distance of three or four miles from the shore we hear the surf like distant thunder : the spray, on the rolling in of every wave, shoots up as if a succession of mines were fired by a train. In this merciless fence the gaps are"], [275, "THE TIDAL CURRENTS. 255 few and far between, hard to find, and, when found, harder still to enter by. Along the distance we have run, there are but three openings where small craft might find refuge, but then only when such refuge is not wanted ; that is to say, with calm weather, a lead ing wind, a tranquil sea, and a full tide. A vessel caught in a westerly gale would have a lee-shore (and what a lee-shore !) stretching in a right line for five or six hundred miles, without a promontory behind which to shelter, or a port for which to make, and (towards the south) with a current incessantly setting upon the breakers. It would seem strange that there should be this surf, not only with a perfect calm, but with a glass like sea. There was, however, where we lay, a slight heaving of the water ; and these heaves, as they bore landwards, became, within a mile of the coast, billows, and then dashed upon it with the extremest fury, as if the Atlantic, in contact with Africa, required not the aid of wind, but shook it with the .spontaneous heaves of its majestic breast. We lay for hours with the same marks on \u2014 as if we had been a rock. The tide rises and falls upon the shore, but does not run along the land. The Atlantic merely heaves up and down, but shifts not its place. It is met in front by a straight line ; and the tidal currents of the coast of Europe are stopped at the great indraught of the Straits of Gibraltar ; so that to the southward there extends a region of some hundred miles of dead water. Hence the violence of the action of the waves upon the shore."], [276, "256 DESCRIPTION OF CURRENTS. With our indented and slanting coasts, there is always a current running in front of the land, which serves as a breakwater against the effects of the rise and fall of the tide : here there is no such protection. In like manner may be explained the incessant disturbance of the Bay of Biscay : the horns break the tides along the shore, and the Atlantic surges in upon the con gested waters. Below Rabat a current begins to be sensible ; it runs south. At Mogadore it reaches the speed of three knots an hour. There are combined to produce it, the sweep of the back eddy of the Atlantic, and the nightly gales which blow from the sea into the interior of Africa to supply the rarification of the Great Desert. This nightly indraught begins only at the province of Sus ; to the north the ordinary land and sea winds prevail. In these latitudes it is calm at sun-rise and sun-set. The breeze freshens by night from the land, by day from the sea \u2014 the former breath ing a gentle gale, the second reaching to a top-gallant breeze. The sand is not blown up from the sea, as some have supposed, nor down from the Desert. In travelling over it, you would suppose that you were crossing a rocky country. On the coast its structure is exposed, and there it appears to be a bank of sand, with a coast of stone. Worn by the waves, the unsupported rock comes tumbling down, and the fragments often sticking on the edge form the breakwater. The \"conformably over lying \" rock, is an induration of the sand by oxide of"], [277, "NATURAL DEFENCES OF MOROCCO. 257 iron ; sand, newly exposed, immediately begins to crust. This bank must have been left by the waters of the deluge, escaping westward, charged with the sand of the interior. This idea was first suggested to me by the deposits on both sides of the rock of Gibraltar. The sand blocks up to its very roofs a cavern which opens to the eastward. Thus have been estranged the land and the water, and the approach to each is closed from the other. Such is the defence of Morocco on the ocean side : its iron-bound coast on the Mediterranean is scarcely a less formidable bulwark. To the east, and to the south, it is encircled by deserts and wildernesses. I had subsequently the satisfaction to find that this fence of rocks had not failed to fix the attention of the ancients. An old author, quoted by Suidas, says, that \" rocks, to which the name Harmata,* was given, were strewed along the shore by Hercules to defend it from the approach of wild beasts.\" The beasts are ships, to which the names of animals were given \u2014 from the figure-heads this fertile source of mythological personation has given us Pegasus, the Ram of Phryxus, the Bull of Europa.

We have viewed at our leisure the city of Salee and Rabat, and their environs. It is a strange place and country. The land is a series of long, gentle, bare, sweeping drives, at the edge cut out into cliffs and cones as if with a pastry cutter. About three miles north of Salee we descried, through the mists of spray, a magnificent palace. It changed to a gaunt ruin. A little further on there is a kubbe, or saint's tomb, surmounted by a dome, like the tombs of Jud\u00e6a and India. Next comes the point of Salee, and over it flutters the red flag of the \" Rovers.\" Gardens sur- round the town, and a few palm trees are seen among them. Between Salee and Rabat the river enters the sea over the bar. Rabat is imposing with its fortresses. The great tower stands on elevated ground at the bottom of the harbour.

Across this bar was launched a large part of those hordes which followed Jacob Almanzor, and of that expedition under his successor, of half a million of men, which have immortalised the Navas de Tolosa. The Moorish empire then extended in Africa above a thousand miles from east to west ; and five hundred and fifty, in its broadest part, from north to south. It included also one half of Spain, and menaced the remainder. It embeUished Africa as well as Seville and Cordova, with some of the noblest structures that any age has produced. It caused arts and science to flourish amidst the ravages of war. Rabat outshone the \" court\" of Morocco, \u2014 merchants gathered to share in its commerce, and professors to teach in its schools. A Roman-like aqueduct still strides along the plain, and from the tower, raised to supply the want of mountains, the fleets of foes, or the convoys of friends, could be descried for twenty leagues at sea.

Further to the south, there are long lines of low white walls connected with a small building, where the Sultan was residing.

The French steamer, that was recently here, came to press an answer from the unfortunate monarch to an ultimatum from the French government, giving him the option of war with France or Abd-el-Kadir. It was painful to reflect how much the fortunes of Europe, and the internal condition and ultimate government of France, were dependent upon the weak ness or caprice of the descendants of the \" Posers of Salee.\" For a step involving the entrance of French troops into Morocco, by changing the position of Algeria into a basis of operation against Africa, would have similarly changed France in respect to Europe. It would have subjugated the policy of the metropolis to the conduct of the colony.

The opinion of Lord Nelson as to the importance to England of the friendship of the Moor, proves that Morocco was a piece in the great European game, and one which even his antagonists understood. But Napo leon's moves were beyond their reach. His game was lost by his own faults ; their merit (I speak not of mere battles, or even of campaigns) consisted only in turning to account the incidents of his fortunes. The siege of Gibraltar was promised by him to the Spaniards, when the French troops crossed the Pyrenees ; and such a measure would have powerfully contributed to the success of his project. Gibraltar, in that case, would have been the point of the opera tions of the war. But this course could scarcely be taken without some chance of success, and that depended entirely on the dispositions of Morocco."], [282, "262 PLAN OF SIR SYDNEY SMITH. Napoleon having foregone all the political advantages to be secured by this siege, it may not be too much to assume, that he made the mistake in respect to Morocco which he did in respect to Spain, and per ceived that the Moors were beyond his power to secure, or his reach to coerce. At St. Helena he recognised the identity of the position, and the simi larity of character of the two people. I now recalled the incidents which, in early life, fixed my attention first upon such subjects. Sir Sydney Smith had taken the trouble to detail to me his plan for counteracting Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. It was to occupy Morocco. He described it as a country of inexhaustible resources, once the granary of the world ; it had lost nothing of its fertility, and contained vast accumulated treasures. The people had been long oppressed, and would gladly hail an in vader. England with ten thousand men, might make herself mistress of it, and gain in it more than India, and save India by frustrating Napoleon in the rear. We had begun a great mistake, by driving the French out of Egypt. By Morocco we should have restored the balance in Europe, prevented a great war, and have joined France in introducing civilization and Christianity into Africa. Well do I recollect the perplexity into which I was thrown by these ideas : fortunately, it was not to a European that I had recourse to discriminate between right and wrong, but to an African \u2014 Hassarn d' Ghieo.

He showed me, that if England had so involved herself, it would have been left open for France to establish herself in Egypt, and thence act against India; that England had triumphed in that war, because France had unjustly attacked other states, and England had espoused the just side. Rabat, Dec. 2nd. \u2014 This morning the bar was com paratively quiet, and seemed passable ; there was also a light wind from the westward. The day was lovely, the ledges of the rock and fortresses were crowded with Moors in their ha'iks squatting down, and they looked like rows of large gulls. A little after one p.m., it being high tide, a large row-boat appeared behind the bar ; presently it came dancing over the surf. We had in company an English and a Portuguese schooner. The English took the lead ; we followed. It was like going into action, and in presence of an audience : every horizontal piece of rock, wall, and ground, was covered with the strange squatting figures assembled to witness our prowess, or mischance. There was great outcry and confusion, and we might have thought there was more noise than danger, had our two companions fared as well as ourselves. They both got on shore inside, but the wind falling, and the tide ebbing, they were cleared of their cargoes, and got off at full tide during the night.

His commission was not from the Moorish Government, but from the consular body at Tangier. After receiving in his hand the health patent, he hastily transferred it to a pair of kitchen tongs, prepared for its unexpected office by having the knobs painted red. On the shore we saw a new building, with arches, in process of erection : it was a custom-house. Before the custom-house we found the governor of the town seated, and received from him a most courteous welcome. The consular agent kindly of fered the shelter of his roof, the only one we could have got at Rabat ; and a messenger from the minister soon after came to invite me to the royal abode. This is the first Mussulman country in which I have had my baggage opened at a custom-house. I was too indignant to be present. I was told that the officer took care to show that it should be only a cere- mony, for he sat at a distance, and was earnestly engaged in conversation when the packages were unloosed. I found, however, that designs had been formed upon my wardrobe. The Sultan had sent an emissary, Mustafa Ducaly, to France and England. On his return, amongst other surprising things, he had to tell that on landing in England, at the port of Southampton, duty had been charged on the clothes he wore.

Their first choice fell on a rich merchant named Mike Brittel, who had taken the lead in the revolt : he declined, and recommended the present Caid, who was there upon chosen. This had happened within the last few weeks ; and the election had been confirmed by the Sultan only since his arrival. Inquiring as to the security of life and property, I was informed that at Rabat confiscation was not a penalty for treason. Here no real property can be held by the Sultan. At Tangier there is confiscation : the lands there are held of the Sultan, as he came into possession by the evacuation of the English.

The Emperor then fixed his demand at 40,000 dollars. The Caid said, he had not the money to pay. The present Caid has shown that he had as much in houses and gardens in Rabat alone. Q. Since he could neither impose contributions on the town, nor extort money from individuals, how did he accumulate wealth ? A.

He then related to me the following story : \u2014 \"Four months ago, the boy now cooking in the patio rushed in dressed as a Moor, and throwing his cap on the ground called out, \"I am a Jew. I claim the protection of France and England.\" Soldiers followed him, but I would not let them take him from under my roof. His father was a renegade. His property (3000 dollars) was placed, on his death, in the hands of an executor, who \u2014 the children under nine years of age being held to be of their father's faith \u2014 forced him from his mother. Refusing to profess Islamism, the mother and the boy were con fined apart, and she was beaten to induce her to influence her son. The boy at last did pronounce"], [291, "A JEWISH BOY. 271 the words \" La Illah,\" &c. ; his head was shaved ; the Mussulman dress put on him, and he was about, as is the custom, to be paraded on horseback through the town, but he recanted. This is death by the Mussul man law. Those who were present describe the child's acts and words as wonderful. He said to the Caid, \" Mahomet has not had power to convert me, and your acts make me hate his faith.\" After this, he made his escape to the consulate, and the door has been besieged by persons seeking either to force, or to seduce him away. Frequently the governor sent me mes sages about him. On one of these occasions, the soldiers while sitting in the court, kept constantly calling to him by the name of \" Abdallah,\" which they had given him. For some time he took no notice, and returned no answer. At last he said, \" Why do you call Abdallah % The boy with that name is dead. There is only here Meshod.\" At my request the boy was sent for : he seemed dogged and stupid, and made very light of his trials. It was with difficulty that I extracted from him a bare corroboration of the story. On being repeatedly urged by questions, he said he had answered the Caid, \" I won't be a Mussulman ; for your religion has no strength. I forgive you my money that I may be a Jew.\" I said to him he ought to be very grateful to the Consul for having befriended him : his answer was, \" I am thankful to God.\" This was one of the occasions on which the religious feelings of the people were liable to the extremest"], [292, "272 STORY OF excitement. In no Mussulman country have the Jews been subjected, as in Europe, to processes for compelling conversion ; but, on the other hand, to re lapse after pronouncing the fatal words is a crime for which there is no forgiveness in the Law, and no power of mercy in the State. The whole case here rested upon the boy's having uttered the profession of faith ; yet in the official correspondence which I have perused, this fact is suppressed. The persecution in this case arose from the guar dian, who would have been remunerated for the ma nagement of the funds by one-third of the property, had the boy been a Mussulman ; but, being a Jew, he could not inherit from his Mussulman father, and the whole of the property would go to the Sultan. The Ca'id's profit was out of the counter-bribery of the guardian and the mother. The circumstances becom ing known, general indignation was aroused against the Caid. Immediately afterward the application was made to the Sultan for his removal ; and this was one of the charges preferred against him. A parallel incident, which occurred five or six years ago, has been introduced and falsified on the Spanish stage. I repeat it as it was narrated to me by the Jew, who detailed it to the Spanish Dramatists :\u2014 \"A Jewish girl, the daughter of an ill-tempered mother, having been beaten and in great sorrow, one day ran into the adjoining Moorish house (at Tangiers the Jews have no separate quarters). The Moorish women were charmed with her beauty, spoke"], [293, "A JEWISH GIRL. 273 to her kindly, and advised her to be like them, and live with them, and she preferring them to her own people, repeated ' La Illah,' &c. The women thereupon went to the Cai'd, and told him that a Jewish girl whose name was Skemish, and whose face was like her name (Sun), had come to them, and that God had enlightened her. The Caid was glad, and sent for her. When she came, she said that the Moorish women had lied ; but they having testified as before, she was shut in a prison with water only and black bread. The Caid then, not knowing what to do, sent to tell the Sultan. Word came that she should be sent to Fez. The Caid then sent for the father of the girl, and said, ' You must pay me forty dollars for the expenses of your daughter's journey.' But he was poor, and could not pay the money ; and he went lamenting through the streets, and so met the Spanish Consul, who gave him the forty dollars, and the girl was sent away with eight soldiers. A traveller over took them on the way, and joining company with them inquired her story, and said she deserved death ; but pitying her, he said he would converse with her ; so they suffered him. This was no Moor, but a Jew and a neighbour, who had disguised himself as a Moor, in order to encourage her to remain steadfast and support her affliction. When they had come near the city, she was made to halt, and great honour was prepared for her. Four hundred young men, chosen from out of the servants of the Sultan, played before her the 'powder game.' Preceded by these, and followed by a great concourse of people, she was conducted to the vol. i. T"], [294, "274 STORY OF palace. Next day the lady of the Harem came to her. She kissed her between the eyes ; made her sit down by her side ; told her maidens to bring rich clothes, and clothed her with them ; and then taking her by the hand, they walked in the palace and the gar- dens, and the lady said, ' All these things shall be yours, and you shall have a prince for a bridegroom.' The Jewess answered to the lady, ' What matters it to the bird whether its cage be of ivory or of reed, or whether it be hung in a palace or a hut 1 ' After several days, word was brought to her, that she must get ready and come to the Sultan. She came before the Sultan, and he called her, ' My dear Skemish,' and made her sit down beside him, and he was eating kusscousoo, and he said to her \" Eat.\" But she said, ' I am a Jewess, and cannot eat kusscousoo prepared by your people.' The Sultan said, ' Islam is true.' But she answered him boldly. Then three baskets were brought, one with embroidered clothes, in another precious stones, and in another pearls : ' These,' said he, 'are the marriage gifts I had prepared for you, and you shall choose a bridegroom of the sons of the Ca'id's.' But she answered him as before. He then became very angry, and said, ' Now your blood shall run like water on the earth;' and she answered, 'I am ready to die.' She was then given over to the Caid to be judged according to the law as an apostate. The Caid, when he found that his words did not persuade, nor his threats move her, assembled the rabbis and the elders of the Jews, and said to them,"], [295, "275 A JEWISH GIRL. ' If this maiden, once a Jewess, remain thus perverse, the Sultan will assuredly slay not her. only, but every Jew in Fez. Advise then what you shall do.' So the elders went to her in the prison, offering to absolve her of the sin, and telling her that it was better for one soul to perish than the whole people. She an- swered, ' Every man must bear his own burden : the blood of all the people will not save me : I will not do this thing.' And the Jews went out wonder- ing. The Caid then sent word, that on the next morning he would come with a crown of laurel (such was the word) in one hand, and the (paper, for her execution,) in the other. On the morrow, when the prison door was opened, she was kneeling on the ground, and remembering the words of the Sultan, she said, ' Let my blood now run on the earth like water.' So the Caid was sorrowful, closed the door, and came again on the morrow, and found her kneel- ing in the same place, and again she repeated the same words ; so it was appointed that she should die on the next market-day. And when the day came, four criers were sent forth to proclaim that a Jewish woman was to die, for she had reviled the prophet. When she was brought to the market-place, in the midst of a great concourse from the town and neigh- bouring country assembled for the market, she prayed to have a pair of trowsers ; ' lest,' said she, 'in the struggles of death, I should expose my nakedness ; and some water, that I may wash and pray.'

And on that word he struck off her head and spat upon it. \" The Jews of Fez obtained the body on the pay ment of 3000 dollars, and gathering it up with the blood in a linen sheet, interred it with great lamentation, and they built over it a tomb like that of a saint, and those who are afflicted with disorders go to pray there, and are cured.\"* Compare with this, the story in Maccabees of the mother and seven sons, who suffered death rather than eat forbidden meat. * The name given to the girl was \" Sols as the story was told me in Spanish.

The facing of one of the angles has been stripped off by lightning, show ing the interior of the masonry, which is composed throughout of stones exactly squared. The wall at the upper part is between six and seven feet thick. It is ascended by an inclined plane, up which a car riage might be driven. The centre is an inner tower composed of five stories of square halls, with the roofs in stucco, like the Alhambra. The outside is figured and carved.

There all the towers had names \u2014 Hippicus, Piphunis, Mariamne : so the gates had names, as Genuath ; but the gates, like those of Rabat, were probably structures exceed ing the towers in dimensions. The staircase has been rendered impracticable both at the entrance and near the top, but we clambered up by the aid of holes in the walls. We could now take in the fortifications of Rabat. The whole forms a triangle, the sides of which are the river and the sea coast; the apex is the Cazata on the point of Rabat. It covers a space of ground considerably larger than Granada. Adjoining the tower there is a large cistern with ten parallel walls running half through it, and beyond this, the extensive area of a mosque with many of the columns standing. They are of granite, unpolished. A century ago a missionary mentions the mosque as unroofed, with three hundred and sixty columns. This group of buildings is surrounded by massive walls in Tapia with turrets.

What measure do they not give of the power of Morocco, in the time of our Henry I.? Like the pyramids, they were reared by captive hands ; they were bedewed with Gothic blood, and Christian sweat and tears. To forty thousand of the Christian slaves employed in them, the Emperor had promised freedom on their completion, and he gave them liberty to choose a district for their habitation. His ministers represented that such a colony would be dangerous. \"My word,\" said the Emir el Mos lemin (Miramolin) \" is passed for freedom, and what is freedom without the means of protecting it 1 \" They were settled in the mountains to the east of Fez.

The Sha banets were at that time undistinguished from the surrounding population in manners, languages, and religion.

The common prisoner for us is an encumbrance, for them he was the chief booty. The estimating of the value, and the distribution of the shares amongst the captors, were defined and arranged by a peculiar code. A captive, for instance, made from a fortress within cross-bow range, belonged to the captor on payment of a fifth of the value to the king. Beyond cross-bow range the captor received a third of the value from the governor who got the slave. This treatment of a captive shocks our sense of military honour, and so the lesson which war ought to teach is lost \u2014 that each is answerable in his per son and fortune for his nation's acts. The judicial and sacred character of war remains so long only as the captive is treated as a guilty man. Our civilization respects in the prisoner the professional man, because it has converted war from the execution of a sentence into a trade. Riley relates a conversation with some of the tribe on the borders of the Timbuctoo desert. \" We cannot,\" said they, in answer to his remon strances, \" give quarter, because they ought to die who give us cause to use our w-eapons.

There were various little fires and round trays of tea : they hailed us and made us land, and we had to drink tea with them. There was a nephew of the Emperor amongst them, a fine lad, almost black, with beautiful Greek features approaching to that Abyssinian cast, some individuals of which have appeared to me to be the most wonderful specimens of the human race. Homer was of the same opinion. Several Spanish renegades were pointed out to me : they were criminals who had escaped from the Spanish presidio. The Moors spoke of them without con tempt ; the Jews told me they were much esteemed.

The male factor was sheltered for a year and a day, and was then free. He would have been kept there for life, had the object been to people the fortresses. This is further confirmed by the singular privilege of these sanctuaries to receive women who had run away from their husbands, and once within them they are freed from the bonds of matrimony. These provisions will be found in the Charter of Ferdinand IV., granted to Gibraltar, and afterwards confirmed by Alonzo XI. From the benefits of the sanctuary were excepted only traitors \u2014 those who had delivered up castles \u2014 those who had broken the king's peace, or seduced their lord's wife. Thus Moses separated three cities of refuge \" on this side Jordan towards the sun's rising ; \" * that is, on the side of the enemy and on his border.

There were formerly a great many emigrants from Algiers. They have died and wasted away : as the French colonization has advanced, they have retreated before it : they have preferred abandoning the graves of their fathers, their homes, their substance, their friends, to living where the Fih ruled.

The Consul has repeatedly proffered assistance ; it has in every case been declined.

While Henry, the first of European monarchs, was putting himself in open opposition to the Church, and setting her highest recognised authority at defiance, that authority re ceived an unexpected recognition and homage from a Saracen and semi-barbarian sovereign in Africa. An nazir, the Mahometan ruler of Mauritania Sitifensis, sent to Rome a Christian priest, Servandus by name, with the request that he might be consecrated bishop of the church then existing at Hippo. Gregory's answer to this prince announced his compliance with the Saracen's desire, and the due consecration of the designated prelate. He thanked Annazir for his liberation of many Christians in his kingdom from slavery, and for his promised manumission of more. \" This goodness,\" he said, \" God the Creator of all things, without whom we cannot do, or even think anything that is good, hath breathed into thine heart.

The knights guarded the coast against the Saracens, but were obliged to keep choir when not on duty. The friars wore a white habit : the knights were dressed like seculars, but wore a white scapular on which, as on the habits of the friars, were embroidered the royal arms of Arragon.

If I am to judge by his words or his air, never was city in the enjoyment of profounder repose, or man of more perfect felicity. In the time of the late Emperor, Muley Mahomet, they killed and quartered their Caid, and made the Jew butchers hang up the flesh in the shambles. It was so exposed for three days, ticketed at two blan quillos a pound. Then they came in troops to cheapen it, and haggle with the Jews who were in structed to maintain the two blanquillos. The Sultan marched against the city, but the people withdrew into the Alcazaba, and presented so imposing a front that he was content with an accommodation. Civilized and philosophical Germany can riddle the body of a minister ; but let us not compare such an act with the shambles of Rabat. The one is the frenzy of a people which cannot help itself ; the other is vengeance \u2014 savage, if you like \u2014 but vengeance for crimes, applying a salutary lesson to those who are to follow. Such is the difference between the two con- ditions of existence. No reactions and no vengeance can profit where social evil springs from theory and legislation. Where the evil is the act of man, vengeance comes, like the storm, to clear the atmo sphere, thus compensating for the ruin it has wrought. D 2"], [312, "292 THE GOVERNOR OF EL GARB. I met at a house where I was visiting to-day, the governor of El Garb, whose encampment lies opposite our windows. I was told that he is chief of two millions of souls. His rule extends from the river to the neighbourhood of Tangier. There was nothing in his outward appearance to distinguish him from any other Moor : he went away unceremoniously, followed by a single attendant. The master of the house served me with coffee himself, and fancying that I liked milk, went down to the kitchen and brought up in his hands a basin of curds. Coffee is not in use, but it was especially prepared for me as a Turkish compliment. The coffee about which the French papers made so merry, as finding it all ready at Isly, was no proof that Marshal Bugeaud was unexpected, but the reverse. The sellers of water use a little bell, which carries us back to Canaan. The Jews had bells to their garments ; bells are still used in their synagogues, and ring every time the Bible is produced. The bells of the Etruscans were not to the Roman taste. Bells did not pass with Christianity from Jud\u00e6a through Greece to Europe. In Greece they are not in common use, and wherever they are found, are a modern innovation. In all the primitive districts, a bar of metal, or a sounding board, supplies their place ; and a small one is beaten by the hand through the streets, before matins and vespers. The Spaniards have bells to their churches; but not, as the mode of ringing them shows, derived from us. They strike"], [313, "BELLS AND BARBARY CAPS. 293 them with the tongue, just as the Greeks do their sound ing board with the hammer, and a peal from the bells of a Spanish town recalls a manufactory of steam boilers, and a street of coppersmiths. There is no indication of bells amongst the Arabs, nor in any other ancient country : they belong to the Jews and Etruscans. Barbary has furnished with caps the Western World. From the Atlantic to the frontiers of Persia, a cap is known by no other name than Fez. In Europe it goes by the name of Tunis [Bonnet de Tunis), in Morocco it is called Shashia. It is pointed like a sugar-loaf, with a small blue tuft at the top. Throughout the East it is worn under the turban. In Constantinople, now that they have dropped the turban, they wear it large and full ; but the Shashia of Barbary is precisely that worn by the Flamens of Rome. With the slightest modification \u2014 and a modification which is not at pre sent unknown here \u2014 it becomes the Phrygian cap. Ph\u0153nicia being the link between Phrygia* and Bar bary, the cap and its colour would seem to belong to Tyre. It is singular that to the Easterns our head dress should be the symbol of license, while theirs to us is the emblem of liberty ; and still more so to find that both have come from a people who are the type * The Phrygians were, I imagine, of the same race.

These hats are made of straw, like Leghorn bonnets, and with little tufts of many-coloured silks : thence, probably, the metaphor of women being crowns of glory to their husbands. They have another usage which renders it more complete and distinct. When I was first at Tetuan I met a brother of the Caid, who subsequently was ambassador at Paris. His haiik was over his head, but he threw it off, and then came out a bald pate. Being the first time that I had seen a shaved head in public, \u2014 I was very much astonished, and inquired into the reason, and it was told me that he was not married* and in Barbary, is not permitted to put on a cap till then. In the Sock at this place, I had subsequently seen men from the interior with bald heads, and a rope of camel's hair round them. It is remarkable and picturesque, and suggests the idea of the crown of thorns. It did not at the time occur to me, that the rope or band round the head, \u2014 for I have afterwards seen it a band of platted palmetto leaf * \" The young men,\" says Marmol, writing in the middle of the sixteenth century, \" shave the head and beard until they are married, when they allow the beard to grow, and the tuft of hair on the crown of the head.\" \u2014 Africa, vol. ii. p. 3. \" Men of all ranks and conditions,\" says a writer at the begin ning of the last century, \" are obliged to wear caps after they are married ; and till then all their youths, even the king's sons themselves, commonly go bareheaded.

At all events, it is singular to find here the fillet round the bare head, and the cap only worn after marriage, while in the Highlands, there is the snood, or fillet, for the unmarried girls, and the cap, or much for the married woman. The Gaelic name for the cap, is properly carachd (cruch), but much is common north and south : now much is a Hebrew word applying to some soft and delicate but unknown substance. * It is supposed to mean silk ; the snood has always the epithet of \"silken,\" and a peculiar silken kerchief completes the head-dress of the Jewesses of Barbary. The name for the stuff has therefore been given to the dress when adopted by the Galatean women in India, just as the name of the dress in the case of cotton,f has been transferred to the substance. In Solomon's Song it appears that the practice of the Jews was for the mother to crown the son on his marriage-day ; but the word which we translate crown, conveys also the idea of covering the head, or putting a cap upon it. That some similar usage must have prevailed in ancient Greece, or some rite been intro duced amongst the Greeks with Christianity, is shown in the expressions at present in use.

The connection of the fillet and the snood, is ren dered more probable by that of the Shashia and the Highland bonnet. These are the two kinds, the flat, (liena) and the point (viruch). The latter has been nicknamed \" Glengarry.\" It owes its peculiarity to the slit ; something very like it may be seen in the tombs of Egypt. The flat one has now generally got the addition of a chequered border, but that varia tion was introduced by the Regent Murray. It is, however, still worn without the border, and then it is a variety of the Shashia. It has preserved the two original colours, though it has exchanged them, the bonnet being blue, and the tassel red. Amongst the Basques it may be still seen red with a tassel blue. On my return home, I found the colonel of the regular troops, who had come to pay me a visit. He was pacing the cancellaria ; he was smoking a cigar, and he was spitting on the floor: \u2014 I recoiled from the triple abomination.

No one had shown him civility, and he could not even get a bath (there are no public ones). This unburden ing of his mind was followed by a flow of spirits : he sent for his uniform, displayed it, dressed in it, and then sate down to dinner. While seated on a chair at a table, with a tumbler of wine in his raised hand, in walked two attendants of Mustafa Ducaly, bearing the usual dish or tray of kuscoussoo. He was struck mute and motionless ; the untouched goblet was replaced on the table, and presently he arose and withdrew. The uniform which is to displace this ancient and magnificent costume, is a caricature of us, as much as a scandal to the Moors ; yet it is paraded as a necessary condition of learning the use of arms. In the last century, the Spanish army, indignant at the introduction of the Prussian discipline, exclaimed, \" With the old tactics we raised Charles V. to the throne of Germany, and Philip V. to that of Spain ; we put Don Carlos on the throne of Naples, and con- quered Parma and Oran :\" no doubt the argument was inconclusive. But to tell the Saracens that their costume is unfit for military purposes, was reserved for the genius of the nineteenth century.

The Cazaba, the fortress with the beautiful gate, has a separate government, and is inhabited by a distinct people ; a remnant of a tribe, the Oudaiah, which, on the failure of the plans of the Sultan against Clemcen, in 1832, was sacrificed to the public indiguation \u2014 against himself. They furnish an instance of the tenacity with which these races, or rather families, cling to life. The shred of the broken tribe settled in these ruins has still friends, as they told me, but a long way off, in the desert beyond Timbuctoo. After the revolution of Rabat, they were seized by the like fancy, when their Caid, apprehending mischief, took sanctuary in the tomb of a saint. The Sultan, Spartan-like, would not violate it, but converted it into a prison. Prisons, without doors or guards, were to be seen, in the time of Muley Ismael ; it being customary with him to order a culprit to gaol, as with us an officer is put under arrest. The beautiful quarter of the Cazaba had been offered to the Jews, but refused, for fear of exposure in case of war. They selected the eastern angle of"], [320, "300 THE JEWRY IN RABAT. the town nearest to the great tower, for the Jewry, and it is impossible to imagine any thing more filthy. The narrow passages between the houses are divided into heaps of dung, and holes of rats. The first house I visited contained no less than fifty souls. It was a hollow square with columns, and bright colours, and mosaics ; with fragments of Gothic fret-work and corridors ; and so small and neat, and so densely peopled with heads stuck out from every pigeon-hole above, below, and around, that it was like a toy-shop or a piece of mechanism brought on the stage, or a little gem theatre of itself. I defy the most active and pains-taking imagination to picture to itself a Moorish house ; it is quite impossible to describe it, yet equally so to resist making the attempt : I will, however, await a more fit occasion, or a more congenial humour. From the roof (for like that of Rahab at Jericho, it was built on the city wall) we had a good view of the tower. On my expressing a desire to go to it, they uttered exclamation on exclamation, and could not have been more dismayed, had I proposed to them to wade to the dreaded bar. They told me that a Jew, if he ventured into the grounds below, would be shot like a duck or a dog, and that a Chris- tian would fare no better. There are nineteen places of, or rather rooms for, worship. They do not use the word synagogue ; \u2014 they say, Beth-el-Elim, House of Knowledge.

Amongst the Brebers the Jews wear arms, and dress like the rest : a Jew going there will not be able to distinguish his co-religionists from the Mussulman.

The Jews invited the Moors over to Spain. On the growth of Gothic power, the Jews and Moors were treated as one peo ple : they were persecuted and expelled together. They found refuge in Barbary, and preferred it to any other country. The Jewish ablutions consist in washing the hands and face. The water is poured from a jug ; the left hand performs the service to the right as the most honourable, then the right does the same to the left. So far it is the same as the Mussulman abdest, only it does not extend to the feet, and is performed three times a day, while the Mussulman repeats it five times. Soap is not used in the religious ablution of either ; but the Mussulman washes with soap, or gayule, in the morning, and before and after each of his two meals. The Jew has to wash all his body on Fridays, but without soap : this is no offset to the weekly bath of the Mussulman, established by custom though not enjoined by law, and repeated besides upon other occasions. They have to take off their shoes in passing a mosque, which is not without its influence on their apartments. No traveller in the East can have failed to remark the establishments attached to the mosque for purification, &c, or the cleanliness and peculiari ties of the corresponding parts of private houses.

They are subject to blows from any one and every one, and the occasion is afforded by every holy place, where the shoes have to be taken off. Still, I have not remarked that they suffer much. Up to the pre sent time, I have not seen a Jew beaten or insulted, and I have witnessed on several occasions their recep tion by Moors of the first rank, in which it would have been impossible, but for the dress, to have known the difference. Besides, the Moors are not proficients in the art of \" self-defence,\" and could not plant a blow if they set about it.

The regalia of Morocco is enriched with a pair of embroidered slippers, which are, or used to be, carried before the Sultan, as amongst us the sceptre or sword of state. This superstition of the old slipper reminds me of another. In the Highlands the great festivity is the ushering in of the new year. The moment is watched for with the utmost anxiety; every one then rushes into the streets, with posset in hand, embracing whoever he meets, and shouting \" Huy meneh ! \" This word has puzzled the traveller and antiquary ; it was the very word which the Greeks repeated, no more knowing its meaning than the Highlander : Hymenea or Hymeneu ! and out of which come, Hymen, Hymn, &c.

It may have taken its rise in their being the fiscal agents for king, bishop, monastery. and proprietor. First assailed from social animosities, their manner of screening themselves (which was af forded in no other country) aroused the inextinguish able hatred of the Christians. That part of their history, suggested by circumstances before me, is their facility in receiving baptism, then, of course, relapsing ; and there can be no doubt that many of these nomi nally conforming Christians, and their children and descendants, filled every grade of the priesthood, and occupied the episcopal thrones of Spain. Out of this again grew the Inquisition, the most artful instrument of despotic power, and which, in Europe, has been mistaken for a religious institution. Finding that conversions were worthless, the proof of apostacy was sought in the traces of blood. The processes of the Inquisition were afterwards imitated by Parliament in England, when, fabricating a church by law, it framed articles to catch consciences, as it now does resolutions to catch votes. The two great events are the emancipation from bondage, and the conquest of a territory. Promises, rights, obligations, and com mandments, are all understood with reference to these. The stranger within their gates was to obey the com mandments.

His Islamism was rather a disease, for which he had to be pitied, than an apostacy for which he was to be abhorred ; and as the Jews took no offence at his religious profession, so the Moors took none at his domestic habits. The Mussulmans accept the practices of the Jews, but not so the latter.

The food, therefore, of the Mussul man, is rejected by the Jews, even to the dishes from which they have eaten. The great obstacle to their amalgamation with the Mussulmans is the character of Christ. In the Mussulman system Christ is the Spirit of God, and is to be the Judge of the world : this, and the recognition of the Gospel by the Mus sulmans, is the stumbling block in their path, and hence the common expression, \" A Jew must become a Christian before he can be a Mussulman.\" The Jew in Barbary appears to me more Jewish than elsewhere. The burden on him is greater, and religious support less. They are Sadducees, if I am to judge by the conversations I have had with some ; and have no idea of believing anything. In proportion to the association of a system of religion with domes tic matters is it enduring. Those of Menu and Con fucius stand, while the more theoretic one of Zoroaster has passed away.

Judaism in Barbary is not propped up by belief, nor is it by etiquette ; but chiefly, I should say, by cookery. In this respect they are under constant restraint ; ever linked to the race, and disjoined from all others.

This is the Dafina* and the day on which all cooking was forbidden, has, in consequence of the prohibition, become the feast-day of the Jews. In these countries, kitchen-ranges and hot tables are unknown. It is the practice to make as many fires as there are dishes to be simultaneously cooked. Those who have served in India understand how soon a few holes are made in the ground, and how speedily a multiplicity of pans are simmering over them. This tent practice is here preserved in doors, and little earthen pots, called nafi, constructed so as to allow draught, contain the charcoal, and on these the pots are set to boil. In preparing the Dafina, the first thing is the build of the charcoal in this small fire-pan, to make it burn slow and last long. This is managed by four layers of charcoal in lumps, and charcoal pounded. It is lighted on the Friday about four hours before sunset. The ingredients are successively put in : the last just before the Sabbath commences. The whole is first made to boil, then the fire is re duced by the stratification I have mentioned.

THE BAIRAM. December 10th. This morning Mustafa Ducaly sent me, by his man Selam, a \" Dollond,\" and a ladder, telling me to run to Hassan to see the Bairam, which was to be held on the downs to the south of the city, without the Caid's permission, and a guard was enjoined not to cross the threshold. Authorities and soldiers had all deserted the city. Selam sallied out in search of some one who should pass for a guard, and found a soldier belonging to Tangier who was familiar with Europeans. After passing the gate, I found myself for the first time at liberty to roam, and could not resist the temptation ; so, instead of turning to the left towards the tower, we turned through the gardens to the right, hoping to get through the second wall, or to see the Bairam from it. We made for a huge gate, but on reaching it found it barred. The wall was about forty feet high, and in good repair : there were no staircases. All chance of getting a glimpse of the ceremony was now lost, and we rambled along through the gardens ; but the ignorance of our elected guards, strangers, like ourselves, as to what was or was not taboo, was worse"], [338, "318 SHALLAH. than the severity of our regular keepers. They were at every turn, doubting, fearing, warning, objecting. Our course was like that of a vessel feeling her way over sand-banks : one moment it was \" starboard,\" the next \" hard-a-port.\" \" There it is bad,\" would our pilot exclaim, and ever and anon we were laid all aback, with the \" breakers ahead \" of \" Saint's Tomb.\" We worked on till we came to a gate in the wall facing the east, and issuing forth, beheld another city. This could be no other than the Shallah, of which we had heard so often, and from which spring-water was daily brought. Neither Christian nor Jew is allowed so much as to approach it. Profiting by the occasion, I hastened on before my companions' fears could rally, or their remonstrances be urged. The gate, or rather barbican (for the Moorish word is required to convey the Moorish thing), is peculiarly constructed and ornamented. The arch is the horse shoe, pointed like the Gothic. The vivid colours and stuccos which elsewhere adorn the interiors here, as of Babylon and Ecbatana, are displayed outside ; \u2014 the style is quaint and rich. This city was in ruins before those buildings arose, which are considered the models of that style: the date of its fall is that of the erection of Westminster Hall, \u2014 itself the work of a pupil of the Saracens. The walls of the present city of Rabat, which sig nifies camp, stand on the lines of the camp of Jacob when he was besieging it. Whilst I was making a sketch of the gate, the Moors"], [339, "A SURPRISE. 319 came up beseeching me on their account not to enter ; they proposed to go in and report : they soon came out, exclaiming, \" Holy Place ; \" \" Saints' Tombs.\" I cut the matter short by passing the portal and ascend ing a stair that led to the top of the gate. The prospect thence was enchanting : the ground broke away immediately in front as we looked eastward, the masses of red ruin cresting the heights on both sides, and running down to the river. Beyond spread the plain of emerald green, with the river meandering through it, and the landscape closed with long waves of sandhills of olive green on their summits and red and yellow on their broken faces. I saw not a soul, and was making myself merry with the fears of our conductors, when the alarm was sounded by the dogs, and presently two old men rushed at us, frantic with rage ; \u2014 fortunately they had no arms. Of our Moors, one only retained the faculty of speech. He endeavoured to explain that I had the Sultan's per mission, on which one of the old men (the other had gone to raise the hue and cry) became wilder than before. He would shoot the Sultan ; the Sultan dared not give an order there, nor enter the place except with bare feet. The soldier threw his cap on the ground, knelt down, and jumped up; tried to kiss his head, his hands, his feet, his clothes. I left them so engaged, quietly returning towards Rabat. At the gate Selam overtook me, calling out, \" Run, run ! wild man gone for gun. \" We had a fair start, but I could not con descend to hurry beyond a steady pace : Selam relieved"], [340, "320 AN ESCAPE. himself by mumbling dismal sounds close to my ear, in his broken English : \" You bring me and other Moors into trouble ; I do your bidding instead of mas ter's and Sultan's, and be at Bairam in my new clothes. I be shot outside like a dog, or flogged inside like a Jew.\" At every moment we expected to meet a crowd returning, for the old fanatic, on reaching the town, could raise the people upon us in an instant. How ever, the distance was soon traversed, and before he hove in sight we had reached the gate. It was locked ! We then hastened along the wall to the right, expect ing to get in by the next gate \u2014 there was none ! We came to the steep edge of the river, and there we were completely hemmed in. At that moment, our pur suers, now consisting of several armed men, came in sight ; when a boat with soldiers and horses shoved up close in shore, to drop down the current to Salee. Our Moors hailed them ; they pushed in ;- we scram bled down, and leaping on board, shoved off, and were out of hail \u2014 or at least speaking distance \u2014 before our pursuers reached the bank. They durst not fire, and there being no other boat, they ran back to get in by the Bairam-gate, so as to intercept us before we could be re-shipped back from Salee. In the meantime, we espied a boat belonging to a Portuguese schooner : we hailed it, got on board of it, and were speedily landed and housed at the consulate. The soldier made off to Salee, vowing never to set eyes on Rabat again, and Selam, enjoining profound secrecy, hastened to his master, whom he found with the Caid. Scarcely had"], [341, "321 THE SULTAN AT THE BAIRAM. he told his story when the people from Shaikh ap peared. Fortunately, everybody was busy with his own affairs, and the Caid succeeded in appeasing all ; but this evening there has been great excite ment in the city, and I am told that I shall have to be conveyed privately out of Rabat. However, like the Russian expedition of 1833 to the Bosphorus, to the satisfaction of having got into, I have to add that of having got out of, Shaikh. What an extraordinary thing to see a people thus ignorant, and yet thus devoted to the vestiges of their antiquity : sanctifying spots untenanted for scores of generations \u2014 taking the shoes from off their feet when they press them, and ready to sacrifice to the manes of the departed the stranger who disturbs their long repose ! The Bairam has passed off most happily : the day was splendid ; the gathering and the presents satis factory to the Emperor. He condescended to tell the people of Rabat that they were wholly forgiven ; that the choice they had made, proved them to be wise and just in all their ways ; that he had not ratified their choice because they had made it, but because it was the best that could be made ; and that, though young in years, their Caid was old in wisdom. The Sultan has also released a former governor of Salee, and sent a pardon to a son of the late Sultan, his uncle, who has been four years in irons at Mequinez. The dis grace yesterday of Hamuda has proved a golden oppor tunity for him. The firing of his regiment with two vol. I. Y"], [342, "322 THE ADMIRAL OF SALEE. pieces, was quicker than that of the other with their ten. The Sultan went up to him and complimented him, saying, \" God prosper you ;\" upon which all the grandees did the same. Mustafa has also come in for his share of good things. Eight field-pieces which he had offered as a present, were refused as such, in these words ; \" I want you to become fat and not lean, because you are my friend, and now I make you the head and master of the merchants of Morocco.\" The ladies of the harem have not, however, been equally scrupulous, and have made no difficulty in receiving the keepsakes he has brought them from Europe, con sisting, among other things, of dresses of brocade at twenty guineas a yard. The afternoon was spent in receiving visitors, among whom was the admiral of Salee in a gorgeous Algerine costume. He is also captain of the port and pilot, and the representative of the first family of the empire, Muley Idris, its first founder, who is also one of the chief living saints. Four of this family are bound to compliment the Emperor on the Bairam ; they had come for that purpose, carrying with them the offer ings of the capital. Two of these accompanied the saint, and presented the strongest contrast that could be imagined with the fanatics from whose balls and daggers we had just before escaped. They were affa ble, curious, facile, and lively : they had never seen the sea before, and admired it like children. They explained their visit by saying they wanted to know what a Christian was like, never having seen one."], [343, "323 BUFFOON OF THE SULTAN. When I told them about Leo Africanus and El Edressi, the geographers who on the fall of the dynasty had taken refuge in Sicily, where his history was written, they were exceedingly delighted. They invited me to Fez ; and when I spoke of the difficulties of a Christian going there, they declared they would an swer for me with their heads. They spend to-morrow in attendance on the Sultan ; the day following they are to repeat their visit here. I must not omit another important personage, no less than the Sultan's buffoon : this, indeed, is the third visit I have received from him, and each time he has carried away two or three bottles under his girdle, besides one in his sack. He has a good voice, and a wonderful stock of strange songs, and is an admirable mimic. I have heard him mingle together the muezzin chant, from the minaret, with the cries of a European vessel getting under weigh. He is a compound of the zany, mimic, minion, bard, and bacchanal. The strangeness of this people, instead of wearing off, increases with acquaintance \u2014 so much ease and facility at one monent, is followed by unexpected and unaccountable difficulties.

However primitive Morocco may be in its customs, it has to be borne in mind that the convulsions which accompanied the rise, and more particularly the fall, of the Beni Marine dynasty, and the almost total subjugation of the country by Portugal, and then the civil war (and that ensued before the establishment of a Sheriffean dynasty), reduced this region, in a period of two generations, to an almost chaotic state. What shipwreck must there have been of old usages ! A few traces appear in the three or four meagre works written on Africa in the sixteenth century. The town of Salee, as described by Leo Africanus, would scarcely be recognised in the city which lay before me, of which I could measure the dimensions and observe the contents, though I could not pass the gates. \" It is most pleasantly situate upon the sea-shore, within half a mile of Rabat, both which town and the river Barugrag separateth in sunder. The build ings of this town carry a show of antiquity on them, being artificially carved and stately supported with marble pillars. Their temples are most beautiful, and their shops are built under large porches; and at the end of every row of shops is an arch, which (as they say) is to divide one occupation from an other. And to say all in a word, here is nothing wanting which may be required, either in a most"], [345, "325 OF SALEE. honourable city, or in a flourishing commonwealth. Moreover, here resort all kinds of merchants, Christ ians, and others. Here the Genoese, Venetians, En glish, and Low Dutch used to traffic. The inhabitants do weave most excellent cotton. Here, likewise, are made very fine combs, which are sold in all the kingdom of Fez ; for the region thereabout yieldeth great plenty of box and of other wood fit for the same purpose. Their Government is very orderly and discreet, even until this day; for they have most learned judges, umpires, and deciders of doubtful cases in law. \" This town is frequented by many rich merchants of Genoa, whom the king hath always had in great regard, because he gaineth much yearly by their traffic. The said merchants have their abode and diet partly here at Salla, and partly at Fez, from both which towns they mutually help the traffic, one of another.\" The change in the disposition of the people is not less marked than that in the character of the city. Little would one suspect to-day, that two centuries ago, Christians were thus hospitably received and kindly treated in Salee. He continues : \u2014 \" In the year of the Hegira, 670, it was surprised by a Castilian cap tain, the inhabitants being put to flight, and the Christians enjoying the city. * * * And albeit this town was in so few days recovered from the enemy, yet a world it was to see what a wonderful altera tion both of the houses and of the state of govern ment happened.

I have seen several of the renegades. The French are the only ones who have any knowledge by which they may be useful. One came to talk about a project of a wire suspension bridge over the Seboo. He re mained nearly the whole day, and detailed his life and adventures during the dozen years he has been in this country. Several of them have been with Abd-el Kadir. They spoke in high terms of the presumed succession of the Sultan, and of some other leading men. With these few exceptions, their discourse was most unfavourable to the Moors, whom they called cowards and braggarts. In their battles the loss never exceeded twenty men ; and a single French regiment might march to Morocco. The Arabs, they said, were divided amongst themselves ; but the Brebers were still more so ; and the art of Government here con sisted in setting one tribe against another, and one chief against another. Their remedy was disciplined troops. If the Emperor, said one of them, had had five thousand disciplined men, he never would have received M. Roche. I said, that if the Emperor had known how to transact a matter of business, he never would have been insulted by the presence of that person, and that one hundred thousand men would not give him"], [347, "OF ABD-EL-KADIR. 327 that knowledge. I instanced Spain and Algiers as evidence of the power of resistance of a country des titute, not of regular troops only, but of a Govern ment. I added, that a regular army facilitated inva sion, but not defence, and generally proved the means of rendering a people an easy prey. Certainly, to put an army at the disposal of the Emperor of Morocco would be the means of doing so. Abd-el-Kadir was rated very low, and spoken of very little. The Europeans admired him for his valour, enterprise, generosity, and humanity ; but did not respect his military judgment. They said that he uselessly exposed men and tribes, threw away great opportunities, and afforded to the French the means of extending their authority. If Abd-el-Kadir had not been playing a game, at all events a game was played in his person. He was necessary to the French military system of Algiers. He is known to have been three times in their hands, and to have been suffered to escape. From one who had been for seven years the com panion of Abd-el-Kadir, I give the following incidents. After the destruction of the Turkish Government, the most powerful chief was Mahmud Ben Ismael, the de scendant of the man who had first entered Oran on its evacuation by the Spaniards. Abd-el-Kadir came next by his family and religious character: differ ences arising between them, the latter had to fly, and took refuge in Oran, asking the assistance of the French. They did not neglect the opportunity to"], [348, "328 THE FRENCH RENEGADE AND ABD-EL-KADIR. sow divisions between the tribes, and gave him arms, ammunition, and twenty thousand dollars. With these means he defeated his rival, who, in like manner, came to the French, and said, \"You have strengthened my rival against me ; deal fairly now by me.\" They required that he should acknowledge himself the vassal of France ; but this proposal he rejected. Abd-el-Kadir from that time continued at war with the French, till the treaty of the Tafna, by which the French appeared to gain some show of title, but in reality invested Abd-el-Kadir with a quasi sovereign character. The rupture of this treaty was occasioned by the violation of the Emir's territory by the Duke d'Aumale, when returning from Constantine. He led the troops through passes which exposed them to be cut off, had not treachery been at work. A French renegade had insinuated himself into the confidence and affections of Abd-el-Kadir. This man stole the seal of the Emir, and wrote letters to the Chiefs, requiring them to allow the French to pass. A Jew, who in the pillage of the treasury of Algiers had secured a quan tity of jewels, and had, therefore, to fly, and was in the deira, discovered the fraud. High words ensued in the tent of the renegade : the conversation was carried on in French, and M. Lascases, a French ad vocate, who, compromised in the affairs of July, had taken refuge with Abd-el-Kadir, entered the tent to implore them not to speak so loud. He thus became acquainted with the transaction. (He afterwards came"], [349, "MOORISH INTEREST FOR C1RCASSIA. 329 to Morocco.) The Jew was quieted, and induced to remain and sup with the renegade. Next morning the renegade had left, and in the tent the Jew was found dead. At Mascara the renegade took one of Abd-el-Kadir's people to accompany him, as if pro ceeding somewhere by his orders. On arriving at the French posts, he clapped a pistol to his companion's ear and blew out his brains. He rejoined his country men, and was immediately appointed to an important post in the army of Africa. The renegade whose opinions I have been report ing, saw the absurdity of the attempt to change the national costume. The haik and other clothing of the horsemen might appear an embarrassment, though, in fact, it was not so to them ; but the sulam or bor noos of the foot soldiers was a costume rather to be adopted by other nations than changed by the Moors. The most interesting part of the conversation was the anxious inquiries they made respecting the suc cesses of the Circassians, of which vague rumours had reached them through Egypt. One of these men had been with the Ai Fatu, one of the most powerful tribes, numbering thirty thousand horse. The Sultan has built several fortresses round them, but the most of these they have taken and destroyed. Their mode of attack is this. They allot certain portions of the wall to the different tribes or families ; they then advance simultaneously on all sides, with bags and hurdles to fill up the ditch, and make a bridge to the rampart. Many fall, but those who sol-"], [350, "330 AN ARAB STORY low march on. If any hang back, their wives are taken from them, and they are not allowed afterwards to marry. Here is the Roman testudo, or perhaps the origin of it. Their cry is, \" Shields to the wall.\" They shave their beards. Speaking of the difference between the Arabs and the Turks, this story was told by one of the former. When Mahomet left this world, he delivered to the Turks a standard, and to the Arabs a standard, telling them that he should return in forty years to require it of them. Then the Arabs took their standard and cut it into many pieces, and each man put his piece by in his breast ; but the Turks took care of the standard, and, making a chest of cypress-wood, they put upon it forty locks, and they laid in it the standard, and gave a key to each of the elders of the forty tribes. At the end of the years Mahomet came to the Arabs, and said : \" Where is your flag ? \" and they all called out, \" Here it is \u2014 here it is ! \" and each man put his hand into his breast, but the pieces could not fit ; so Mahomet said to them, \" Unworthy ser- vants, the empire is departed from you.\" And then he went to the Turks, and said to them, \" Where is your flag 1 \" They answered, \" We have laid it by ; \" and he said, \"Bring it forth.\" So they called the elders together, but one was wanting. So he said to them, \" This is a pretence, for you have lost the flag ; \" and they said, \" The elder is gone to look after his flocks \u2014 an elder of the people cannot be wanting. Come again to-morrow.\" So Mahomet came the next"], [351, "OF MAHOMET. 331 day, and there were the forty elders with the forty keys ; so they opened the chest and brought forth the flag ; and Mahomet said, \" Good and faithful servants, the empire is taken from the Arabs and given unto you ! \""], [352, "332 MULEY ABDERACHMAN CHAPTER V.

To-day I saw the real potentate overshadowed by the Sheriffean um brella. He wore a green sulam, with a white sash or turban bound over it, which had a most singular effect. The umbrella was carried by a horseman on his left. The umbrella is of the ordinary size, but the spokes are straight. It is covered with crimson velvet, and has a depending fringe or border. Two men carried before him long lances upright, to spear on the spot, as I was told, whomever he might point out for that purpose. I could distinguish through my glass his broad Mulatto features, as he inclined right and left to the saluting crowd. As for two Fridays he has not been to mosque, his appearance to-day, and his look of health, have occasioned great rejoicings. Selam said to me, \" Moors not like English \u2014 look much to king. \u2014 English king die ; no troubles Gibraltar, Malta \u2014 Moorish king die ; all cut one another's throats.\" Muley Abderachman has reigned twenty-three years. He had been employed both as governor and minister,"], [353, "HIS CHARACTER. 333 and was assiduous and incorruptible. He was origin ally a merchant of Larache, where the loss of a cargo first made him known to the late Sultan, his uncle, and he gave him, in consequence, the government of Moga dore. His conduct in that post induced the Sultan to appoint him his successor, as being worthier to reign than any of his own sons. He was not, however, seated on the throne without bloodshed, and the com mencement of his reign was marked with severity. His authority once established, his previous mildness reappeared. He is fond of money, and no one ever knew better how to gratify that taste ; but his word is inviolable, and he is no less orderly than upright in his commercial dealings, which extend to every por tion of his kingdom. Wise in small matters, he is foolish in great ones ; and his merits render tolerable, or his astuteness sustains, the false and ruinous com mercial system he has introduced. The mountain Breber tribes recognise the authority, but do not admit the interference, of the Sultans of Morocco. His power over the tribes of the plain, whether Breber or Arab, apparently severe and some times terrible, is unequal and precarious : when he punishes, it is by abandoning the tribe to the ven geance of some neighbouring and rival clan. Such a state of things seems to be as befitting for the exercise of his talents, as his talents for adjusting them to his own satisfaction. Morocco is isolated from the world : on the west an unapproachable coast ; on the east and south an"], [354, "334 M. CHENIER ON MOROCCO. impassable desert. It has no neighbours except the Regency of Algiers. Its standing policy was to be at war with Europe. Muley Ismael, visiting Tetuan, ad dressed the body of council who had come to com pliment him, in these words, \" It is my pleasure to be at war with all Christendom, except England and Raguza.\" Yet they made treaties with the merchants of the states with which they were not figuratively, but really at war. M. Chenier, who was French consul fifty years ago at Tangier, has written the best work upon Morocco. He confined its foreign relations to Algiers ; it is with reference to that Regency, that he calculated its military force. He esteems Morocco the weaker of the two, and in danger from Algiers. The Turks had invaded Morocco from Algiers, and they once placed a sovereign on the throne of Fez, but that was long ago. Foreign relations had been to them a novelty, which they ought not to be, seeing that the princes of this land formerly assumed the lofty title of Emir al Moslemin ; that they have never ceased to claim the chieftainship of the Arab race, and have never con descended to sign a treaty with the Sultans of Con stantinople.

The goods are bought and sold at what would be a loss, if the taxes were accounted for ; and when any one of them is unable to meet his engagements, he has only to go to the Emperor and borrow, and thus again heap up the mass of engagements, he never can meet. He is encouraged by the knowledge, that the Emperor never calls a creditor to account ; \u2014 the settlement comes only on his dying day. It is not trifling sums that * In the terrors and alarms which followed the treaty of July 1840, one of his ministers thus describes the scene at the council : \u2014 \" Nous etions dix, et nous n'en savons pas plus l'un que l'autre, et il y avoit le roi, qui n'en savoit pas plus que nous, et qui sang lottait.\" (The above was written while Louis Philippe was still held to be the \" ablest man in France,\" and the \" wiliest politician in Europe.\") t Those who pay ready money have 25 per cent, discount allowed them.

The debt of the English agent at Mogadore, is between forty and fifty thousand pounds. These concessions of credit, the loans of money and the granting of permits, and monopolies, are managed, not with a view to the pecuniary interests of the sovereign, but for political ends. By these means he paralyzes all resistance to his illegal taxes on trade in the cities whose business these imposts are considered to be. This ledger management of a nation is an effort of genius worthy of Mehemet Ali. The fons malorum, here as elsewhere, is the customs' duties. They have everywhere been introduced by evasion and fraud ; for, until a people is familiarised with them, they are too monstrous and wicked to be argued about. In Mussulman countries the task has been more difficult than with us, as there is no church property with which to bribe public assemblies, and taxes on commerce are expressly prohibited by the code at once of religion and government. A people so tenacious of old customs as the Moors, and so little disposed to imitate Europe, were not easily brought under on such a point, and their recent history affords two instances of revolts occasioned by illegal taxation. The first revolt was in 1774, when the principal citi zens of Fez (an unprotected city) thus addressed the Sultan, Sidi Mahomet : \u2014 \" The city of Fez means not to disobey, nor ever could so mean ; but the taxes kid' on provisions, and the increase of duty on merchants, and which the Mussulmans\" (the term is analogous to \"the"], [357, "THE REVENUE OF MOROCCO. 337 country\" with us) \" regard as contrary to custom and religion, were considerations that to so great and so religious a prince might excuse the general murmur and discontent.\" No punishments followed the suppression of this rebellion, and the taxes were abandoned. \" Snuff was farmed, and an octroi placed on commodities per load, as they enter and go out of towns, or pass ferries ; a stamp was put on woollen stuffs, and on all the trinkets made by goldsmiths. The governors of the towns farm these taxes at a fixed sum, by which they very seldom are gainers. These new imposts are considered among the Moors as innova tions, contrary to the spirit of the Koran. These taxes produced a revolt at Mequinez in 1778, but it was put down by the black guard of the Emperor.\" Chenier, whom I quote, distinguishes the revenues into ancient and modern, the ancient being the tenths, the capitation tax (tribute) of the Jews, the profits of coining, arbitrary impositions ; the modern being the obnoxious duties and octroi. He highly commends the ancient system : the tithes he considers profitable to the Government, and not onerous to the people (of course, he is mentally instituting the comparison with Europe, because paid in kind. \" He who grows ten bushels of corn pays one, Avithout any retrospect or inquiry concerning a more abundant harvest, which presents an example of justice among barbarous states well worthy the imitation of the more civilized.\" The collection was easy, because, being united in vol.

Being paid in kind, the Sultan had magazines in the great provincial towns to store these revenues, and sent to market the residue, after maintaining his palaces, soldiers, and dependants ; consequently, there were no currency troubles. The present Sultan, by making the merchants his debtors, has converted the guardians of common rights into his satellites ; and finding his account in remitting the payment of the customs, and allowing himself to be defrauded of what we should esteem a legitimate revenue, he has so far succeeded. Customs are looked upon as the affairs of the merchants, and the merchants are all foreigners and infidels. Taxes are then arbitrarily imposed on trade \u2014 monopolies are granted, and the whole produc tion of the country is paralysed and subjected to a foreign influence, which they cannot indeed unravel, but against which there is a deep and universal sense of reprobation. It is not from Europe that they will learn the secret of the ancient well-being of so many states and empires, which were great without parlia mentary votes and political economists."], [359, "FINANCE OFFICERS OF RABAT. 339 CHAPTER VI. THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN RABAT. The civil government of Rabat is vested in the Caid, whose functions I have already described.

There is no con- fiscation in Rabat for any crime ; but by the custom- house system he is becoming the proprietor of all the property. The Nadir has from these funds to pay the poor Talebs, or learned men, which absorbs a great portion of the profits. There is a Beit ul Mai, or public treasury.

The office is well known in Turkey, but here z2"], [360, "340 \"THE MOORS' CHURCH GOVERNMENT.\" he belongs to no independent body, and exercises but slender influence : it has not, however, been always so. Mr. Addison, a chaplain of Charles II., and some time at Tangier during the English occu pation, thus speaks of what he calls \" The Moors' Church Government.\" \" They have in every cavila (or county) fin Alcalib or high-priest, in whose nomination the secular power doth not at all interpose, for he is chosen out of and by the Alfaques, and invested with power to depose or otherwise chastise the offending clergy. Immediately upon this arch-priest's election, he is possessed of the Giamma Gheber, or Great Church, wherein upon every Friday he expounds some text of the Alchoran, unto which exercise he always goes accompanied with the chief personages of the neighbourhood. This eminent churchman is seldom seen in public but at this exer cise. For, to make himself the more reverenced, he affects retirement,* spending his hours in the study of the Alchoran, and in resolving such cases as the laity present him, who esteem his resolutions as infallible ; and this, with a careful inspection into the deportment of the inferior clergy, doth constitute the office and government of the Alcalib. As for his revenues, they are suitable to his condition ; and as to his life, it is * El que hoy vive en Tetuan es un hombre en el exterior modestissimo, muy mortificado en los ojos ; humilde en las pala bras, curitativo con los pobres y nunca permiti a sus manos el contacto physico de el dinero. \u2014 Mesoon, Historial de Mar rueccos, 1. i. p. 25."], [361, "THEIR JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. 341 austere and reserved, he affecting a peculiar gravity in all his carriage. Every Alcalib has his distinct diocese, out of which he has no power, so that the Alcalib of Beni Aros hath nothing to do in Minkel, for every one is absolute in his own cavila.\" Mr. Addison gives the following interesting details respecting their judicial proceedings : \u2014 \"Here's no intriguing the plea with resolutions, cases, precedents, reports, moth-eaten statutes, &c. ; but everything is determined according to the fresh circumstances of the fact, and the proof of which is alleged. The testimony of two men, if they are of known sobriety, is sufficient to make good the allega tion, but there must be twelve to ratify it, if their conversation be suspected. \" In taking the testimony of a Moor upon oath, the servant of the Alcaldee carries the deponent to the Giamma or Mosch, where, in the presence of the Al caldee, he swears by that holy place that he will declare all that he knows concerning the matter to which he is to give evidence ; but oaths are never administered to any in another man's case but such as are suspected persons, and they are usually num bered among the rogues and faithless, who have no credit without them. Besides, it is never permitted for a man to swear in his own case but for want of witnesses, or when the accusation is of that nature that the impeached cannot otherwise receive purga tion : as for the Christian and Jew, they are suffered to give testimony according to the rites and customs"], [362, "342 RECOVERY OF DEBTS, AND of their own religions, but the Moors are not forward to put them upon this trial, as doubting that fear of punishment should tempt them to perjury ; and those who are thereunto accessory (according to the Moresco principle), are involved in the guilt. \" In pleas of debt it is required that the reality of the debt be first manifest, which being done before the Alcaldee, he signifies it to the Almocadem of the cavila where the debtor lives, who, upon his signifi cation, commands a present payment to be made ; but if the debtor refuse, or be unable, to give the creditor satisfaction, the Almocadem remits him to the alhabs or prison, which is always near the Almo cadem's house, where he stays till bailed thence by sufficient sureties, or personally pays the debt.\" The following on the same subject is from the ponderous records of the Franciscan Friars : \u2014 \" It is customary for all the chief priests and doctors of law to assemble with the other great people of the town, and for the Mufti or Cadi to read aloud to the Emperor a short recapitulation of some of the laws of the Koran, which direct that he shall preserve the empire, administer speedy justice, protect the innocent, destroy the wicked ; and so far from countenancing and keeping near his sacred person any adulterer, that he shall punish adultery, prevent the exportation of corn and provisions to the prejudice of the people, tax provisions according to their plenty or scarcity, and forbid usury to be exercised towards the poor, which is an abomination before God. He is told that if he"], [363, "JUSTICE IN MOROCCO. 343 breaks these articles, he shall be punished as he ought to punish others.\" These extracts will show that Morocco is not now without some rule for the present, and some respectable vestiges of the past. There are other functionaries of the city, whose origin ascends to an earlier period than the Mussulman times. They are public notaries, called Edules ; no doubt the Roman edile. Before them sales are effected, and deeds executed. The present practice I shall give as I have been able to collect it. The initiatory steps are by documents drawn up by Edules \u2014 these have the conjoint cha racters of petition, affidavit, and verdict (in the old sense). The Plaintiff's case is stated \u2014 he signs it. His witnesses then sign, if they agree with his state ment of facts, or state in what they differ. Then follow signatures as vouching for the Plaintiff or Defendant, as the case may be, the witnesses, or the other signees. This act is then verified by the Edules, as to the genuineness of the signatures. Furnished with this document, the petitioner proceeds to the judge, the governor, or the Sultan. He is met by a counter document. The Judge, after perusing these, proceeds to try the case by oral testimony, and with out intervention of legal practitioners. The document is called El Bra, which is very near, Brief.* This is evidently the origin of the Spanish mode of pro cedure by Escribanos. Among the Spaniards the * No word has given rise to wilder speculation than Carta, paper. The word here is caret."], [364, "344 ADMINISTRATION OF oral proceedings are suppressed, and those which are the preliminary steps only in the Moorish courts, con stitute the whole proceeding. The Edules have be come agents to the parties, as well as public notaries; so that the case of each party is placed in the hands of the agents of the other. Thus, notwithstanding excellent laws, the Spanish Courts have been con verted into labyrinths of intrigue. The Moorish system, which exhibits the origin of the Spanish aberrations, still retains the celerity of oral proceed ings, with the advantage of record, and combines the responsibility of a Judge with the uses of a Jury. In fact, it differs little from the ancient institution of the Jury in Britain, which gave their verdict on the common repute of the parties, and not on the facts of the case ; though it does not leave to them the faculty either of condemnation or expurgation. I look, of course, to the system, as what it would be if duly executed ; and it was, no doubt, the foun dation of that prompt justice which characterised the Mussulman government in Spain, and made Algiers a model for quick, gratuitous, and impartial adjudi cation, until its capture by the French. When any one is assaulted or insulted in the streets, or in any way injured in public, and he appeals to the Caid : his appeal is rejected unless he brings as wit nesses those who were present ; but he has the power of compelling their presence \u2014 he has but to cry out, \" I seek justice,\" and every one within hearing must quit whatever occupation they are engaged in, and secure"], [365, "JUSTICE IN MOROCCO. 345 the offender. If they refuse or neglect, they become immediately principals, and the injured person has his remedy against each and all. It is to this rule \u2014 an extended \" view of frank pledge,\"* \u2014 that the tranquillity and security of the towns amongst so turbulent a population is to be attributed ; and whatever partiality there may be in governors, there is no apprehension of false testimony among the people. The office of king, in Morocco, is specially that of Grand Justiciary. The king himself is the fountain of justice. There is the utmost freedom of appeal to him from or against the Caid ; \u2014 he will stop in the streets, and administer summary justice while sitting on horseback; and when any supplicant appears at his gate, however humble, of whatever race or faith, and pronounces the words, \" The God of Justice,\" he is admitted to his presence ; the order is given for the council to be filled ; the secretaries appear in their places, and the petitioner states his or her case, and justice is immediately done. While he has been here, two hours have been daily consecrated to this duty ; and this I imagine to be the secret of those constant peregrinations of the Emperor of Morocco, and their * At Mequinez, a man having found something in the streets, caused it to be proclaimed, in order that the owner might come and receive his property. Muley Ismael sent for him, and thus addressed him. \" You do not deserve death, for you are not a robber ; but as I wish all my subjects to know that the proper way to have things returned to their rightful owners is by leaviug them where they are, I must make an example of you.\""], [366, "346 MOORISH SAINTS. extraordinary effect in quelling insurrections and quiet ing the country ; whilst, by the heavy exactions with which they are accompanied, they might appear calcu lated to produce the very contrary effect. A \" progress of the king,\" is the constant specific in Morocco for disturbance \u2014 there is always disturbance where he has not for a long time appeared ; and he always manages to subdue it. The designation of the court of Morocco is El Haznee, or the treasury. The title of the Minister of Finance in Spain to day is Haciendu. Haznee is treasury or possessions \u2014 the two terms are synony mous, and one is derived from the other : the one briefly explains in Morocco the purposes of govern ment, and in Spain its neces.sities. Our word maga zine comes from Mai Haznee, or treasury of wealth. How surprised the legitimate owners of the terms would be, if they knew the contents of the periodicals to which we apply it. It is impossible to conclude this subject of govern- ment without mention of the saints. What constitutes a saint no one can tell : they are of both sexes and all ages, of every class and rank, from the madman to the philosopher, from the fanatic to the infidel, and from the mischievous and wicked to the humane and benevolent. I met a man with wool on his head, and a long stave in his hand, chanting forth a ditty at the top of his strained voice. This was a saint, and the soldiers made me move aside, for fear he should make a rush at me. They took the man for a madman ; he"], [367, "MOORISH SUPERSTITIONS. 347 was none. There was some time ago at Tangier, a female saint, who went about entirely naked : every morning ,she took from the market-people wood, and laying it in a circle made a fire and seated herself in the middle. There are respectable families where saintship is hereditary : these bury the saints when they die, in their own houses. In these saints are to be found traces at once of the asceticism of early Chris tianity, which had its birth in Africa, and of those practices which, in the still earlier times of Polytheism, rendered Africa a scandal and wonder to the rest of the world.* Since the introduction of Islamism, the superstitions of a country, in early times the most fertile in mon sters and chimeras, have been associated with that faith, and have produced that strange veneration of dead saints and sanctifi cation of living fools, which is without parallel elsewhere ; and weaving themselves into the religious forms of a people whose civil govern ment is derived from its sacred writings, the distinc tion between the doctrines of the one, and revolutions of the other is effaced, and thus do we find the names of dynasties derived from the denomination of sects. All the great dynasties, save one, have begun with saints or preachers. Fez and Morocco were built by * I refer to the orgies practised among the polished Cartha ginians, and better known as belonging to the worship of the Cyprian Venus, and which are reported by credible witnesses as of public occurrence at no remote period in Barbary, on the part alike of male and female saints."], [368, "348 MODE OF OPERATION BY followers of teachers who settled around their cells to listen to their words, and share in the repose that resulted, if not from the justice they administered, at least from the respect which they inspired.

The operation of their drugs upon the human body appears chiefly to be through the nose, and by means of the chafing-dish. The plants and gums are supposed to possess distinct qualities and virtues.

But they were not men to discriminate, and, certainly, it was not by children that the separation could be effected. They told me that the Moorish envoy, who was recently at Paris, had seen an Algerine boy highly commended by his French instructors, who, nevertheless, nourished in his heart almost a detestation of the French ; and said that he was striving to acquire the know ledge they possessed to be able to drive them out of Africa. I pointed out the difference between a captive taken in war and children voluntarily sent for instruction, who could not come back to their primi tive life but to look with contempt on their fathers. Some remarks ensued, which showed that I was suspected of jealousy of France, so I had to argue the point. I told them, that if I coveted their land for a country, I should be glad to see France there, or even conquering it, for it would fall out as in India and America. France doing everything by her Go vernment, as they said in Algiers, she always had awakened and ever must arouse such an amount of animosity against her, as to render untenable every conquest effected by her arms.

That Western world may have had its beginning, its progress, its multifarious phases, its great exist ences, its long life, and its decay in the same way that we have had ours, without there being a neces sary connexion, although there be infinite points of resemblance with the numerous forms and accidents of Egypt and Etruria, of India and Chaldea.

Dec. 18th. In this country, as I should think must happen in China, the attention is fixed on the most trivial things ; or, rather, the importance appears of things held to be trivial. One feels in contact with the world in its infancy ; as if, by stretching forth the hand, you could reach the source of the earliest inventions for supply ing our wants, or gratifying our desires.

Here, too, are the rudiments of what we find in other forms elsewhere. What can be more striking than to be called, as I was myself to day, a Nazarene ! the first title applied to the Apostles by the Jews. By the exclusion of atmospheric air, the most deli cate flower may be handed down to future ages. Here a similar process seems to have been applied to man : the cause of change is excluded in the one case \u2014 change itself in the other : elsewhere, letters graven upon brass and marble, are our guides through the evolution of ages ; but here man himself is the un dying and unchangeable record of himself. This morning I was watching a Negress who rejoiced in the Punic name of Barca, washing and cooking in the court below. Her extreme and minute cleanliness suggested the question : \" In what could cleanliness have consisted before the discovery of soap ? \" Soap comes next to absolute necessaries. What must have been the condition of nations without either soap or the bath 1 What a benefit to the human race the discovery of either; \u2014 where neither was known, filth would be as habitual as clothing : there could be nothing clean or unclean. The use of the bath must then have made that difference between one people and another, that exists between filthy and cleanly animals, altering their very nature. Yet I could not tell when it was discovered, or who were the inventors. Why should it alone be without honour, or parentage '("], [381, "THE DISCOVERY OF SOAP. 361 Whence its name 1 * Our word is from the Latin, but soap has no Latin etymon. The name is not derived from the Greek ; it has, in that language, no corre sponding term. The modern Greeks use the same \u2014 either their soap has travelled eastward since the decline of the Roman Empire, or it belongs to the East at an earlier time. In this dilemma I apply to Barca, and at once obtain the solution. Soap, in Arabic, is Saboon. They have the verb, Sabein, which does not mean to ' soap,' but, to ' wash.' The Arabs did not adopt the name from Rome, and coin out of it a verb for so primitive a usage as washing. The Moors possessed soap made to their hands, mea sured by mountains, and cheaper than manure. This substance is decomposed flints, or soap-stone : it is called Gazule, or Razule ; it polishes the skin, makes it soft, and gives it lustre. It abounds on the river Seboo, and may, when exported, have got that name abroad. It is not fit for washing clothes, for which purpose they have a primitive soft soap like that of the ancient Celts \u2014 this is what they call Saboun. The first mention made of it is amongst the Gauls. The Romans had so little acquaintance with it in Pliny's time, that he thought it was used for the pur pose of turning the hair red. It is no trifling honour to the Gaulish race, looked upon as barbarous, that the Romans should have taken from them beds and niat- * Beckman derives it from an old German word sepe.

The best which they make is of beech wood ashes and goat's suet, and it is made in two ways, either thick and hard, or liquid and soft ; but the one, as well as the other, is very much used in Germany ; and a great deal more indeed by men than women.\" * Great ingenuity was exerted in discovering and applying various kinds of earths and solvents to clean the body and the clothes, as may be followed at length in Pliny ; but yet the best mixture at which they seem to have arrived, is that which was used in Greece, of which the preparation is described by Aristophanes in the Frogs \u2014 a compositions of ashes, nitre and crinoline * Nat.

Avicenna calls it Al Siraph, from a town on the Persian gulf. Dioscorides says, gall prepared with nitre and earth of Cineola, is the best detergent. The ancients knew the saponaceous root with which in India shawls and muslins are washed, and which the Persians, Turks, and Arabs, use for the hair, and otherwise where great delicacy is required. It was from a Persian word called Asleg, by the Arabs Condus, by the Greeks arpoiidtov, whence orpovdittiv. Pliny calls it (Nat. His. 1. xix. c. 3), \" radiculam et herbam lanariam.\" The detersives used by the ancients were various, but were nearly the same as those in present use among the Mahometans. They were called by the general name of smeg mata. A common detersive was bean meal, which the Romans called lomentum, and a paste from lupine flour. Galen (De Ali ment.

Lomen tum will take away wrinkles, if we are to believe Martial (1. iv.) Lumento rugas ventris quod condere tentas. Pliny says (1. xxviii. c. 25), that lupine flour made into a paste with vinegar, will, if smeared on in the bath, remove pimples and itching, and dry up running sores ; that a decoction of lupines will cure freckles and brace the skin. * Pliny, xxviii. 51."], [384, "364 DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER VIII. DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE MOORS. The domestic arrangements differ here from other Mussulman countries. The house is not divided into Harem and Salambu. In fact, there is no harem, for there are neither its rights nor privileges : the separa tion of the women, which in Arabia could not be ex tended to the habitation, adapted itself to the gyn\u00e6 ceum of the houses among the Greeks, and the Zanana of the followers of Zoroaster. In Morocco, there having been no such anterior practice, the injunction has had no effect on those who live under the tent, and has converted the domiciles of the inhabitants of the cities into inhospitable abodes. I went to-day to Mike Brettel's, on invitation, expressly for the purpose of seeing his house, which is just finished. I can see nothing more remarkable at Fez or Morocco, so I shall endeavour to describe it. We approached by a narrow lane of blind walls about twelve feet high. The door was in the corner, the arch above it, and the lintels were painted in broad bars, and stripes of deep colours like an Egypt ian tomb : there was a knocker \u2014 nay, two \u2014 one for"], [385, "A MOORISH HOME. 365 the folding doors, and another for the wicket; the upper one might have been made in London. We knocked : the knock is neither a single tap, nor a postman's double rap, but a double knock, though neither quite so loud or long as those with which the squares of London were wont to resound. The door not being immediately opened, we heard with in a bell rung sharply, (in Eastern countries the bell is unknown), and the door was opened by a young girl, a slave, small, yet apparently full grown. She wore a tunic of blue and white, striped, which left her neck, arms, and half her legs bare. Her colour was chocolate, her features perfect, her form a model. Her sparkling eyes and white teeth announced that the visit was expected ; and, waving her hands as a signal to follow, she tripped up a narrow staircase by the door. The steps and passages were inlaid with hexagonal red tiles and small triangles of green tiles : there was no flooring about the house richer than this, which is very modest : the houses and court yard of the Jews are in Mosaic. At the top of the stairs we found ourselves in a small vestibule, the light let in from above, through the ornamented por tions of the ceiling. Everything was in proportion : all palace-like, but microscopic ; \u2014 I might have taken it for the abode of the pigmies of Herodotus, had my guide not rather suggested fairies or sylphs. The vestibule led to an apartment, where the master of the house was seated in the middle of the floor with a tea-tray before him. Seeing me busied"], [386, "366 A TEA-PARTY IN RABAT. in taking off my shoes, he came forward entreating me to enter with them on ; for it is common to imagine that Europeans make it a point of honour to disregard the feelings of their Eastern hosts, and to soil their carpets. This room was the gem of the house, but it was some time before I could venture to examine it, being shamed by the officious zeal of the Jews who accompanied me, and who began at once to point out this and that, as if we had en tered a shop, \u2014 I mean a European one, \u2014 for in an Oriental shop the decencies are not neglected. Mike Brettel commenced making tea; \u2014 they use fine green tea \u2014 they put it into the pot with sundry sweet herbs and large lumps of sugar. The teapot was Britannia metal, the cups and saucers the small delicate Chinese. The tray was of a manufacture for which Rabat is celebrated. It is brass chased in arabesques and inlaid in colours. At Mecca they work in the same way. He rang the bell for hot water and sugar, which were brought, the one by the olive maiden already mentioned, the other by one whom I might have taken for her, had her tunic not been white and red. The hot water was brought in a common tin kettle, the sugar in a japanned epaulette box. The two little slaves having discharged their office, returned and stood with crossed arms against the white wall, which cast forth as from the field of a phantasmagoria, their plump, symmetrical and dark limbs. They seemed to have been sent on the part of the female household to do all the work of gazing on the strangers ; and if"], [387, "A MOORISH ROOM DESCRIBED. 367 I had to judge by them of those we did not see, Mike Brettel's Harem, for beauty, originality, and sprightli ness, had little to fear from competition, far or near. I was accompanied by the consular agent, his soldier, and a common Jew. After Mr. Leraza and I were seated, the soldier was invited to sit down, and then the Jew : he did so quite familiarly, clo.se to the master of the house, who, with his own hand served him, after the rest, with tea. The room was a cube of fifteen feet ; there was one small window, a simple aperture in the white wall in the form of a niche struck through the thickness of the wall, levelled inside ; this feature took the apartment out of the common-place. On the floor was spread one of their beautiful mats ; on the three sides were mattresses covered with Turkey carpets, and cushions at each end resembling a low Turkish divan. The wails were dead white, broken by richly-ornamented arm-racks. Three long guns on each in their red cloth cases, daggers in massive chased silver scabbards, swords and pouches, were suspended by silk cords with krge tassels, blue, red and yellow. The crown of the room was the ceil ing : an octagon dome was fitted on to the cube by means of arches in the angles, which will be under stood by reference to the Hall of the Ambassadors, in Owen Jones's Alhambra ; but the roof, instead of being in coloured stucco, was in carved and painted wood. There was no gilding or silvering the effect was worked out entirely from dead"], [388, "368 MOORISH ARMS. colour. I looked at it till my neck was sore and stiff, and I can only describe it by the word ara besque, just as I might say kaleidoscope, and in like manner, interminable : the same elements re appear in never-ending forms, ever pleasing, ever new, yet always, in so far as description can go, the same. The roof was the statue, the apartment the pedestal : each required the other. The solitary light, the pure white walls, the cubic form, were required to set off the placid beauty of the dome. The window was minute ; the door (if one might say so in reference to so small a body,) grand. Its horse-shoe arch expanded to the sides and reached the vault, displaying the little vestibule, all variegated in colours, all ornamented in form like the ceiling. It was a thing not to live in, but to gaze at. We next got our host to permit us to examine the arms. One was of Tetuan manufacture, one of Fez ; the first spirally fluted on the outside : both barrels were inlaid with gold, were four feet and a half long, and ornamented at the muzzle like old pieces of ordnance. The mounting was silver, ornamented with the black figures which in the East are called Sabat. The locks were cumbersome, the work intricate, and all outside. There is a covering to the powder in the pan like the old pieces of the French Gardes du Corps. The price was twenty-five and thirty-five dollars : I should have guessed them at double. The daggers were in no way remark able ; but the cases, handles, and cords were very"], [389, "COSTUME OF THE MOORS. 369 rich : one sword rang like a Damascus blade. Their swords are long and straight, slightly bent towards the point, and have a heavy thick handle with a peculiar guard.* The only other piece of furniture was a Turkish sofra, or small hexagonal stool inlaid in tortoiseshell and mother of pearl, on which is placed the tepsi, or round tray for dinner. The carving of the sofra is peculiar, and might be taken for the model of some portion of a Gothic building. I now saw that this was no Turkish piece of furniture : the Turks, like the Romans, have borrowed from every other people what was most elegant or useful. Augustus intro duced a stool from Spain to Rome \u2014 why should not one have been carried from Morocco to Constantinople 1 As this Moor was reaching down one of the guns, his haik fell off, displaying a rich blue and red vesture, while the volumes of the white toga cast their majestic folds around.

BB"], [390, "370 ECONOMY OF A MOORISH KITCHEN. \" Our fathers have left us many good things, and we are content with them.\" Proceeding on our inspection, we passed through a succession of small courts and corridors, as if we were in the under- story of a palace. There were four houses joined together by doors broken through the wall : these houses are fitted one against the other like so many boxes, the lights coming from the court in the centre of each. In the kitchens there was a great assortment of wood dishes, like low corn mea sures, scrubbed white, as in Switzerland ; rows of round pots, in which the fires are made, called nafe ; and kuskoussoo dishes of pottery called Keskas, the covers in thick close basket-work, ornamented with colours. Every place, thing, corner, was most per fectly sweet and clean. On entering the store rooms it seemed as if we had penetrated into a chamber at Pompeii. (The whole establishment recalled Pompeii.) Jars of the shape and dimensions of amphor\u00e6, only transversed at the point, stood in rows containing, not, indeed, Falernian wine, but kuskoussoo, pease, butter, rice, and even fresh meat. After it is packed, butter is kneaded hard into the orifice, and water is poured over it. Homer says, that in Lybia neither prince nor peasant wants for food, and this was confirmed by the large scale on which the arrangements were here made to meet the demands of hospitality. One of the court yards, with an adjoining kitchen and store, was ap propriated to cooking food, to be sent out to friends and strangers."], [391, "DESCRIPTION OF THE WOMEN'S APARTMENT. 371 We now entered a court which rivalled the first apartment \u2014 all white, light and airy. At each of the angles there was a group of three columns, and from them sprang a lofty fretted arch, which occupied the centre of each of the faces. A narrow cornice in coloured stucco under the projecting eaves ran all round ; so the stuccoes of Spain are not a lost art. From this truly barbaresque hall, open to the hea vens, we passed into the women's principal apartment. It was a long and very narrow room, entered in the centre by lofty folding doors : the wicket only was open. At each extremity was a bed filling the width of the apartment, raised high and concealed by bro cade curtains. In two successive stages were mattresses piled and covered with rich stuffs, and cushions, ser ving for divans by day and beds by night. The open space in the centre was covered with a mat, and there were low narrow seats around of folded carpets and coverlids. On each side of the door were wardrobe chests. The room, to the height of four and a half feet, was hung with red velvet, inlaid to imitate mosaics ; but perhaps the mosaics may be the imita tion with velvet of other colours. The embroidery on the cushions, &c, is unlike any thing else. There are patches of colour as though formed by a succession of the palms of an Indian shawl, one row blue, another red, and so on : the stitches are long and the work looks like satin with bindings, each long stitch being followed by a short one.

The rafters of the roof were ornamented in like manner, vermilion predominat ing. The sleeping apartment had portals hke a church,* their hinges and sockets were on the out side ; the large slabs were of arbor-vit\u00e6, soft as velvet to the touch, and rubbed over with red ochre. We were treated to a sight of the contents of the chests. The dresses were principally in brocade of Lyons ; but otherwise, they were inferior to those of the Jewesses of Tangier and Tetuan, and had not the merit of native taste and work. Not so the jewel- lery. One necklace was peculiar : it was formed of large gold pieces, some of them cufic and coral balls, divided by bunches of pearls, in the centre of each of which there was a pierced amethyst. For the ne- gresses, the necklaces were large coral beads and silver coins alternately, the coins being strung through the centre. The necklace does not go round the neck, but from shoulder to shoulder. At the shoulder it is fas- tened to a brooch of a very singular construction, and is in various ways a most interesting ornament. It is circular, and serves also to secure the haik and in it the most precious stones they have are placed. One was an emerald an inch and a quarter in diameter. * \" The first consuls of Rome, L. V. Publicola and L. Brutus, as also the brother of the latter, had in their patents for the few lands granted them, the distinction of having their gates to open outward instead of inward.\u2014 Pliny, 1. xxxvi. c. 15."], [393, "STUCCOS OF THE HASSAN TOWER. 373 Such were Aaron's ouches on the* shoulders to which the chains were attached. This brooch is called kefkiat, and has a moveable tongue which traverses round a circle, in which there is a slip, so that after passing the tongue through the folds that are to be secured, you turn the circle and thereby the tongue fits on upon it as if it were a buckle. When I saw it, I was immediately reminded of the Highland brooch for the plaid, to which they have adopted the stones which their Hyperborean country affords ; and I recollected having seen an ancient one which seemed to be like the.se. On visit ing Dublin, subsequently to my return from Barbary, I saw in the museum numerous kefkiats, and on re cognizing them as old friends, I was assured by the learned that I must be mistaken, for that these orna ments were peculiar to the Irish Celts. However, there they are \u2014 alone found in Ireland \u2014 alone worn in Barbary.

Over these were drawn a succession of intersecting segments of circles. By these they could work with certainty and celerity, and the mere intersection of the plain and curved lines formed the suggested patterns. This may account for the interminable variety of these, and the uniformity of their character. The stuccoes were of plaster of Paris, and on getting one of the workmen to describe the process of making it, I found that near Fez there is a large supply of arrowheaded selenite, correspond- ing with that of Montmartre, near Paris.* The colour is laid on with white of egg.

The figures which we find in our cathe drals and ancient churches, are scattered about their domestic establishments, are to be seen in their trays, on their stools, and in endless variety upon their tomb stones. They have not, like us, a domestic and a pub lic, a religious and a civil architecture. Alone have they combined delicacy and strength.

I cannot resist the temptation of quoting from the \" Quarterly Review,\" a glowing description of Moorish dwellings. * The Carthaginians hang drapery on their walls.

I thought it best, therefore, to abstain from any intercourse with the Moorish govern ment on political matters, and to take advantage of the entrance I had obtained to see the country. I soon, however, found myself the object of suspicion. K I spoke of visiting Fez or Morocco, I was mysteri ously motioned to be silent. The guards assigned to me watched me as a prisoner. I was not suffered to cross the threshold without a written order from the Caid. The prospect before me was close confinement until I could get over the bar as I had entered, and for that deliverance I might have to wait six months.

They opened many mines ; in every case, as soon as the Moors got possession, the mines were filled up. A promising sul phur manufactory had been recently set up at Fez, by a renegade Frenchman : it was, by order of the govern ment, levelled with the ground, and all the instru ments destroyed, lest it should furnish a new attrac tion to the French ; yet it was to geology and mines that I had recourse to unbolt the gates of Rabat. I raised the question ex abrupto \u2014 spoke of mines to everybody, and exposed the folly of denying to them selves resources, &c. These discussions reached the Sultan ; curiosity was excited, and the matter debated ; the ludicrous exhibition they had made by ruining the sulphur works, partly admitted mineral investiga tion, and had its partizans, and at last I received the acceptable intimation that I might go and \" hunt wild boars \" in the province of Shavoya, whence an inquisi tive chief had brought a specimen of \" madein,\" \u2014 a mag nificent crystal, or spicukted mass of cromate of iron.

Again striking inward we lost sight of the sea, and under the reigning solitude could fancy ourselves approaching the Zahara. The waste was not, however, dry sand or parched deserts ; the land wore a rich vesture, and its tissue was of flowers.

Three sets had been put in requisition without undergoing the requisite repairs and revisions ; girths, buckles, straps, gave way one after the other in a manner which in any other country would soon have brought us to a stand still ; but on each mis chance a man would slip off, make a grasp at a doum branch, and commence plaiting : between the ductility of the leaf and the dexterity of their fingers, girths and bands were miraculously restored, buckles and ties supplied."], [400, "380 PLANTS OF MOROCCO.

Yet of them the stock remains \u2014 not one orphan of Tyre subsists. The next morning was beautiful ; and turning to the eastward, we proceeded on our journey, expecting early in the day to reach sheik Tibi's own Douar. We came upon patches or outliers of the cork forests. In ten miles I counted sixteen Douars, averaging se venty tents ; and the furthest from us on each side was not more than two miles. Thence for fifteen miles, though the land was cultivated, there was neither tent nor tree to be seen. The soil, almost sand, is thinly spread over a face of rock. The festouks and asphodels had disappeared, and lilies supplied their place ; but not a fly, nor a bird, nor a spider, nor in sect, save ants. The hollows were marshes or little lakes ; but nowhere was the mould shaped by the action of water, \u2014 nowhere did the soil imbibe the rain to hold and discharge it, \u2014 no trace of a rivulet. This tract extends along the whole coast, averaging twenty miles in width and five hundred feet in height. Schist, slate, and quartz-rock protrude through it in some places, the line of bearing being at right angles to the coast. I have already explained this formation, the peculiarity of which consists in the surface being"], [413, "SCENERY. 393 converted into stone. At one place the road crossed what looked like a rivulet ; but the extent of its course was 250 yards, that is to say, this was the whole dis tance from the first indenting of the ground till it had opened into a deep chasm. Wherever water filters through, the sand is removed and the rock falls in ; and then the rent goes on like a crack in a plate of glass, widening and deepening to the sea. This is a landscape requiring a new name. I now could understand that strange term, \" Rolling Prairies :\" \u2014 it must be a similar formation, swelling, but not hill like; tame, but not valley-like ; expanse not like that of the sea ; undulations not like those of the land ; and over the whole a preadamite vastness, unbroken till you come abruptly to the edge of the gulfs. Were the elevation thousands instead of hundreds of feet, and the distance from the sea thousands instead of tens of miles, then it would require but snake-grass and buffa loes to witness an estampado without crossing the Atlantic. It was quite delightful to get upon the hills again : they were rugged aluminous schist, well clothed with trees of extreme beauty, but moderate size, prin cipally the cork oak. I here first saw the Arar, the Thuya articukta, a tree between a cypress in the leaf, and a pine in the figure. The wood is invaluable ; no worm touches it, and it endures for ever ; it does not split ; and though hard is easily wrought. They use it for the beams of the houses which are near the ceilings of apartments : those ceilings of \" cedar and vermi lion,\" that we read of in the Prophets and the \" Ara-"], [414, "394 THE FOOD OF ARABS. bian Nights.\" It has the odour of the cedar, and yields pitch and turpentine. There is also an ever green like the thorn, bearing a berry like the haw : they call it Berri, and make oil from it. This is the Eliodendron of the Greeks. Further to the south there is the Argan, from the nut of which a much esteemed oil is made. The oak furnishes the Bellotis, which, without ceasing to be an Arcadian, is here a real food. Habits still draw very closely on the Arcadian. Water is their drink ; their food milk and wheat not fermented, and subjected to scarcely any cooking. To their grain and milk they add dried fruits, fresh acorns, palmetto root, truffles, the lotus berry, and the like. The country produces the plants which yield sago and arrow-root. Hunting was not the primitive state of man, nor flesh his original diet. If all the literature of the world were destroyed except that of the Hudson's Bay Com pany, such a belief might be pardonable in future times. We put ourselves in a similar predicament when we take the pictures of early Greece as the first steps of the human race. The names of the first skyers of animals and eaters of flesh have been re corded, and yet we treat as a fable all that is enume rated of these times, because they talk of living upon acorns. A garden was the residence of our first parents. I had made one step backward towards the reality of early fable, when I wandered in the indubitable Hes perides and plucked their golden fruit ; but now,"], [415, "THE SHEIK. 395 amongst the cork forests, and seeing acorns and glands plucked and fed upon, I made a second, and reached the golden age itself. A man may thus travel and find food wherever he stretches out his hand, or lays him down to rest.

The first peopling of the globe remains the greatest of won ders ; for what can be to us more unaccountable than the ease of their travels, the order of their society, the distinctness of their character, the rapidity of their growth ?

They paraded us round the circle, and we"], [416, "THE SHEIK'S WIFE. 396 were passed from group to group to be examined, pat ted, and discussed. The round of visits ended at the Sheik, and I was ushered in among his three wives ; \u2014 and here was a busy scene. The tent, though I speak from recollection, was little short of forty feet in length and twenty in width ; the cross-bar supporting it in the middle might be ten or twelve feet high; the covering swept down, so that towards the extremities you had to crouch or creep. In the centre and around were piled up stores of provisions, clothing, and the like, arranged for the convenience of sitting or sleep ing. There were three or four small fires, chiefly of embers, on which were boiling large brown jars with long necks, as if preparing for some great feast. The principal wife would soon by her appearance have arrested my attention, had she allowed me or any one else to be ignorant of her presence and authority. She was comely, bold, haughty, supple in body, dexterous of hand. Seated within reach of the two or three fires, she was proceeding to dispose of the cooking viands, which, with a huge ladle, she heaped up in correspond ing dishes. She was giving her orders without inter mitting her work, and all the work of the tent \u2014 culinary, at least, \u2014 seemed to pass through her hands. The dish was kuscoussoo, so I was not to lose such an opportunity. What had been despatched was for the supply of guests who had arrived before us : she now had to recommence for us.

My hostess, seated on the ground, had in her lap a round wooden tray three feet in diameter, the edge resting on the round. The flour-basket was on the right hand, a jar of water on the left. She first took a handful of flour, and dusted it into the tray, then, dipping both hands in the water, passed them through it, and so continued dusting and dipping and then making sweeps right and left through the growing mass, which gra dually shaped itself into small grains. The fingers passing quickly and lightly, through and over it, the little moistened particles were augmented from the dry flour, and new ones formed. The art consists in causing it to granulate, and in preventing it from clotting. Each grain receives with its several coatings pressure and manipulation. We are all familiar with the change of substance produced by working crumbs of bread between the fingers ; and in some analogous change appears to consist the secret of this dish. The fact that the tray was sufficiently full, was"], [419, "MANNER OF EATING KUSCOUSSOO. 399 notified to me by a smart nudge of the elbow. It was then brought upon an even keel, and she dashed away amongst it with both hands in a fine style : it was then thrown into a sieve of pierced sheepskin ; and, shaken and tossed, the smaller grains passed through below, the larger were brushed away from the top : the size, which varies, was, in this case, about that of a large pin's head. The operation was now completed, and it came forth a grain reconstructed from the flour by a process which rendered it fit for food, without fermentation, and almost without firing. From the sieve it is turned into a conical basket of palmetto leaves and placed on the top of one of the long-necked jars boiling on the fire. In a quarter of an hour it is cooked, or rather heated. It is curious to find steam employed, in probably the most ancient of made-dishes. In this simple form, or with buttermilk, kuscousso o constitutes the common food of the people. Fowls or meat, when used, are stewed in the pot over which it is steamed : the gravy is poured over it, and the meat or fowl perched on the top. In these cases, it is turned of course out of the basket into an earthen dish. Gideon in his cookery used a basket and a dish. A still more remarkable operation is that of eating it. The Moor gets his kuscoussoo into his mouth without the aid of a spoon ; yet neither does he drop it, nor does he poke in the plate to catch greasy grains, nor smear one hair of his moustache. He beats the chopsticks with the knowing jerk of the South Sea islanders. A monkey only spills his kuscoussoo."], [420, "400 MANNER OF EATING KUSCOUSSOO. With the points of the fingers of the right hand a portion of the grains is drawn towards the side of the dish.

The meat and pottage is put all in one dish, out of which every one raketh with his greasy fists what he thinks good. You shall never see knife upon the table, but they tear and greedily devour their meat like hungry dogs.

Roche, who had the advantage of Leo by a double apostacy, used his proficiency in the opposite sense, and won the day in his late coup de main, by his dexterity in making and projecting coras. Kuscous soo with other food was put upon a table for him ; knives, forks, and spoons were laid out ; but he seized the kuskas or kuscoussoo dish, squatted down with it on the floor, and turned up the sleeve of his uniform, observing, \" This is the way we eat kuscoussoo.\" That other extraordinary adventurer, Ali Bey, who was sent by the Prince of Peace with the scheme of revolution izing Morocco, until the Spanish forces should be ready vol. i. \u00bb D"], [422, "402 MOORISH BREAD. to land to take possession of it, was equally expert \u2014 in fact, it was a sine qud non of admission into society. Vermicelli and macaroni are derived from kuscous soo. They are both in use in Morocco. Vermicelli is simply the grains of the kuscoussoo rolled long ; it is then called spauria. The macaroni is served as a long roll, coiled like a rope, on a large plate. It is called Fidaoush. The Spanish name for macaroni is fidaos, Fideh, the Greek <pihr,. But the Moors are not ignorant of the art of making bread. On the contrary, they abound in varieties, and have particular kinds for particular seasons. The Spaniards have evidently derived from them their manner of baking, in which the dough is most severely handled, and then, but very slightly, raised or baked. Their bread is something between biscuit and bread : those who have not eaten it in Andalusia, and parti cularly at Seville, do not know what bread is. Fortunate are the people who possess a dish like kuscoussoo. Any comparison between them and the bread-eating nations is very difficult, for they have economy and comforts which are too subtle for cal culation. The Indian has his rice and curry.* The inhabitants of the Eastern and Southern portions of Europe have their dishes (not bread) of Indian corn. The Turks, the Persians, the Tartars, the Arabs, have their pilaf, which spreads from the Adriatic to the Yellow Sea \u2014 from the Yrtish to the Indian Ocean. * They use flour, but not as bread. It is made like porridge, and eaten with milk."], [423, "403 BREAD AS MADE IN ENGLAND. The domain of kuscoussoo extends from the Red Sea to the Atlantic. It does not appear to have been original amongst the Arabs, as indeed no farinaceous food could be ; yet it has the unmistakable impress of antiquity. Wheat is one of those inventions or introductions which in Greece, in Egypt, in Etruria, has a date. We know of it nowhere as original. Its modern use is imagined to be restricted to the Northern and Western portions of Europe. It is, however, universal in Northern Africa, and would appear to have been original among its inhabitants ; and I infer that we are indebted for it to the Holy Land. If we have borrowed from the Philistines the grain ; we have neglected \u2014 just as with Indian corn and rice \u2014 to borrow the proper way of cooking it. In these other grains we cannot be brought to institute any com parison ; but kuscoussoo is wheat. Bread alone will not serve as a people's diet, and is, moreover, expensive. We separate the parts of the flour which are adapted to one another \u2014 and so best fitted for food \u2014 and thus the coarse bread and the fine are equally deteriorated. By fermentation the nature ofthe grain is changed;* and by the baking, while in that state, considerable loss is incurred by the evapo ration of alcohol, which our Excise laws now forbid us to collect.

We do not know baking afloat ; and in the first settlement of that colony, the women were from the cities, and did not know how to bake. The bakers ap pear to be a moral class, for the men were equally ignorant. The colony lived for years on biscuits, and even at the governor's table the guests were in the habit of bringing their own biscuits.

The loss by fermentation and refining taken together, is under-estimated at twenty -five per cent. 18,000,000 quarters of wheat are made into bread annually in England and Wales : the waste is, therefore, 4,500,000 quarters, or 3,357,000,0001bs. of bread, or eight ounces per day per man.

Travellers are always struck by the amount of labour thus thrown away. A learned commentator selects the long conti nuance of this practice to illustrate the stupidity of the human race. This is to suppose an Arab tent in the same row with a baker's shop, or with a farm- yard and a granary attached to it.

By this practice they are secured against the uncertainties of the seasons and fluctuation in price. These reservoirs, when forgotten, may be discovered by examining the verdure in spring, when it begins to lose its freshness. Over the matmore the change is first perceptible, as it is dryer beneath.

No mention of them is made in the New Testament, or in Josephus, or Hecateus, or any writer who treats of the Jews. Yet as this practice is universal, its date must have been antecedent to their dispersion : what more clear than that, when forbidden to appear in their costume, they preserved it in the sanctuary, and in secret bound an image of it to their hearts ?

I have already referred to the metaphorical language of Scripture, applying to loose drapery, and not to fitted clothes ; such must have been the dress then worn : there is no Eastern dress of the present day to which it will apply. It is only by forgetting our own costume that any grave thought can be associated with the expression, \" baring the arm : \" tucking up the sleeves, or appear ing in shirt-sleeves, would be a metaphor amongst us suited to a scullery or a slaughter-house. \" Girding of the loins\" is nonsensical, not only with our costume but with every other : the person is already dressed.

The Moors, though they do not \" gird\" themselves with girdles, wear one, but it is under the haik and over the tunic, and has a remarkable buckle.

What clothes are requisite for carrying on the shoul ders a kneading trough 1 The haik. Why kneading-troughs 1 The Jews did not carry ovens with them. Cakes are kneaded, one by one, on a board or stone, and then laid upon the hot stones or embers, or griddle.* Such is the practice of every no made tribe : a kneading-trough would be of no use. It must then be something of the same description ; of course the kuscoussoo tray. Not a tribe moves here that the women do not carry it \" on their shoulders,\" \" in their clothes.\" When that diet .is used, that dish is of primary necessity ; and on that account, as like wise by its dimensions, is worthy of being mentioned in this manner on the occasion of a sudden flight. The haik and the kuscoussoo are here united. If you heard of any other people having the one, you would inquire whether they had not also the other. Here in one sentence is it shown that the Jews, when they entered the Wilderness, had both. * \" Ephraim is as a cake not turned.\" \u2014 Hosea, vii. 8.

The Jews went to Egypt from the Holy Land ; Abraham therefore wore the haik ; and having seen him in that dress, I can ima gine him in no other. It belongs but to a small portion of the human family to have a change of raiment for the night ; \u2014 a strik ing peculiarity of this dress is its adaptation to both purposes. It is the costume for people who live in tents, and who cannot carry about with them bed and bedding ; who must sleep in their clothes, and who prepare for their night's repose as we do for a journey. Thus, the Jews were commanded, if any had taken the raiment of another in pledge, to restore it \" By that the sun goeth down ; for that is his covering only \u2014 his raiment for his skin, wherein he shall sleep.\" Leaving free circulation of air, and not suffocating the body with its own breath, it is at once subservient to con venience and conducive to health.

No other ancient people shaved the head ; we only hear of it among the people of Mauritania, and that in respect to the children. The Moors, as I shall show, had the bottle from the earliest times.

Thus, with the strigil, the toga would serve to suggest Lydia or Lycia as the source of the Etruscans, if Herodotus had not recorded the tradi tion, or the Etruscans themselves had not claimed this ancestry. This tomb enables me to say that the man ners of ancient Phrygia (I use as a general name that of the chief of the states of Asia Minor) are, at the distance of three thousand years, preserved with a fidelity of imitation, or an identity of character, in modern Barbary, such as at the interval of thirty years can scarcely be reckoned on in Europe. The toga and the strigil are indeed common among other people ; but the shaving is a peculiarity, the value of which I will show elsewhere ; and the preservation, singly in Morocco, of the whole of those features which this tomb presents, must go far to identify the ancient inhabitants of the western districts of Asia and Africa, or the Phrygians and the Brebers, and supports my derivation of the name Africa from Phrygia, which I imagine was given to the latter country, while Breber was given to the Phrygians ; that is, that the names, severally preserved in Asia and Africa, were then common to the two countries and people.

Haiks are like leaves of trees \u2014 you never see two alike : \u2014 as sentences are interminable, yet the syntax one, so have haiks their grammar. They are of all textures \u2014 of many substances \u2014 plain, striped, yet uniform. Silk and cotton are mixed together ; both are mingled with wool ; they are alternated in stripes. The texture varies from felt to sarcenet, from coarse blanketting to gauze ; there is the massive fold defy ing the tempest \u2014 the gossamer wing trembling with a breath ; colours are not excluded, gold is not for bidden. The most beautiful specimen of workmanship and taste I ever saw, was a white haik with a deep border of gold. The haik of the men is absolutely and undeviat ingly white. Colours are reserved for children, some times also for women, but they are associated always with the idea of indulgence and distinction. Thus was distinguished the daughter of David, Tamar, and this was what aroused the jealousy of Benjamin's bro thers, and when the last of the Ptolemies was saluted king of the Romans, he too received from the senate a coat of many colours. To put on the haik, it is dropped on the ground ; one corner is lifted and brought over the left shoulder, and held upon the breast by the right hand.

The excellence of this is, that it follows nature, neither designing to embellish nor endeavour ing to conceal ; it reveals, but does not expose ; it covers, but does not disguise.

He turns his back to the tent, and waits till he is seen, and some one approaches him; he then prostrates himself twice to the earth, and adores. On this a man of the tent takes water in a wooden vase, and advances towards him ; \u2014 it is generally the chief of the family who does so, or his eldest son ; and if there are no men, it is one of the women advances with the vase or something else, to eat or drink, if they have it ; if not, they bring a skin or a piece of wove stuff, to accommodate the stranger. When they have come within a few paces of him they say, ' Is it peace ?\" and he answers, ' It is peace ;' and then they say each to the other, ' May peace be with you and your family, and all that you possess.' Then touching each with his right hand the hand of the other, they carry it to their lips, which is as much as if they kissed each other's hand.

Such things are apt to lead Europeans into the mis take of fancying such a country easily conquered. In the morning we started in a southerly direction to visit a spot from which the sheik had formerly brought a remarkable specimen. We found the block from which he had taken it lying in a field. I was giving directions to dig around that I might ascertain whether it was in situ ; when they, fancying I desired to move it, despatched a messenger for a couple of camels. While I was at work, a sulam fell over me, and on clearing myself and looking up, I saw a stranger on horseback, and found myself bound to refuse no favour he should ask. Elisha and Elijah immediately came before me. Elisha, when the mantle is thrown on him, asks no questions, but leaves his twelve pair of oxen. The stranger said, \" Cure me.\" I answered, \" God alone can cure.\" He then took his sulam, and, throw-"], [464, "444 GEOLOGICAL ing it over my shoulders, brought the collar part of it close round my neck, and kissed my head. If a crimi nal can throw a sulam on the Sultan, or on the ground before him, he has taken sanctuary and cannot be put to death. Soon afterwards I observed some singular black rocks, which proved to be masses of iron : close by there was a hard limestone containing very fine and beautiful madrepores. Two thick layers of the metal stood up in fragments some feet above the ground. We traced it in one direction for about three miles, when it was again covered by the horizontal sand-stone. They told us that in the other direction the same black stone was found in great quantities ; in fact, in the cultivated fields the stones were iron, realizing to the letter the description of the Promised Land\u2014 a land flowing with milk and honey where the stones are iron, and from the hills of which copper * is melted. We found a good deal of slag, but the working had been merely superficial. I afterwards obtained a specimen of lead from the same neighbourhood. We returned to our home in another place. We had left the camp crowning a knoll. We found it in the evening settled on a plain. Two other douars along our route had also moved, and in the same direction, and we passed one of the migrating bodies. There were neither men nor horses, nor any cattle used in tillage. These were, as usual, employed in the fields. This business belonged to the women and * In Sus they run copper by lighting fires."], [465, "RESEARCHES. 445 children. The tents and utensils were laden on the spare cows and camels. Every creature that could carry, from the camel to the goat, was put in requi sition, and you might see, as when flying before Pharaoh, \" their kneading troughs in their clothes upon their backs.\" The men returned from their work in the field, without the loss of au hour, to their new abode. By these removals the country for five miles was like a fair. The pasturing flocks, too, were falling in ; and at our new pitching ground we had five douars within two miles. We counted them, as if they had been so many vessels that had taken shelter in the same creek with ourselves. We diversified our geological pursuits by dragging a valley for boars, but were unsuccessful : they were, however, round us in thousands ; their digging and rooting equalled the ploughing of the natives. We could not take ten steps in any direction without walking on the earth they had recently turned up, and their industry was prosecuted to within a hundred paces of the douar. It was with some difficulty that we regained our geological specimens, for the Arabs had entered into the spirit of the science, which con sists in making collections. The expedition reminded me of Dr. Buckknd's equestrian lecture at Oxford. Hitherto a scrutinizing look at a stone had been supposed to endanger a man's head.

This same prejudice guarded against Ph\u0153nician and Carthaginian the mineral wealth of Mauritania, while they were ra vaging that of Spain. In the settlement of Mauri tania made by Augustus, which was followed by four centuries of repose and prosperity, no traces of its mineral wealth appear, whilst the Roman world was supplied periodically with wheat from its fields. An ancient law forbade the working of gold and silver mines within the confines of Italy. There was reason in this. The facilities we have devised for centrating wealth have rendered of easy accomplishment things which men, had they been wise, would have surrounded with every obstruction. Until the funding system com menced, wars of aggression could be carried on only by a government which possessed a store of gold.* It was not, therefore, merely the depopulation of a dis trict which was associated with the working of mines, but the loss of liberty ; for the conqueror abroad became inevitably the tyrant at home.

It is a \" standard of value.\" I mean not that perversion to which we give the name, but an ideal standard in which all objects are alike rated, be they money, be they merchandise. In my anxiety to entertain my geological compa nions, I was nearly involving the community in war. I had given directions for sheep to be bought for the party for supper. They came to me presently to say that the sheep were ready, but that the people would take no money. I then sent a Jew servant of Mr. Seraya, to one of the other douars to buy them. Soon after there was a great commotion. Seeing him re turn with the sheep, and suspecting the intention, several of our tribe had run for their muskets, and sallied forth to drive the other people back who pre sumed to sell food to their guests. A boar- hunt was settled for next morning. The plough was abandoned, and every man mustered with his gun. Preceded by a tamborine, we marched along the front of the other douars, and each poured forth its troop, amidst great and fierce excitement. There was yelling, running, and firing. My course was im peded by the sick and maimed who were brought and laid down before me. I could do nothing for them; and they were only jostled by the crowd. After we"], [468, "THE BOAR HUNT AND 448 had cleared the douars, we were summoned to the top of a tumulus. A circle was cleared, and a man of another tribe came forward ; they all held up their hands in the attitude in which the Tyrian Hercules is represented, and following the chief or priest, pro nounced these words, \" In the name of God, we, this day, are brothers ; if any man's hand be on his neigh bour, may the hand of the Most Merciful be on him ; if no man has evil thoughts, may our work be pros- pered.\" The beaters, of whom there were about a hundred boys and old men, were told off, and we set forward, with nearly four hundred guns, dropping par- ties to crown the winding heights. The station as signed to us was the brow of a hill ! I started without parley for the gorge below, but as soon as the soldiers divined my intention, they (having come mounted) gave me chase as if I had been an escaped felon. There was no want of boars ; we saw them hopping out of our way, and they all, of course, got off. Not often has a pig kept so much good company waiting without disappointing any one of his supper ; for if we had killed a score not one of the party would have cooked a morsel. Mr. Seraya having early withdrawn, I remained amongst this concourse the whole day without the means of understanding or uttering a single word, and yet, though I was not aware of it at the time, this was the wildest people in the whole of Morocco.

They gave us and received from us the salutation of peace. As we were returning, they were all picking up flat stones about the size of a man's hand, and one after the other came to me with his stone. I had no means of comprehending what they said, and imagined that this was an effect of the expe dition of the day before, and that they had all been bitten by the geological mania. We presently assem bled in a little dell, and they went and threw their stones on the opposite side. One of these was set up on an old stump, and I saw what we were to be about. We sat down in a semicircle, in front of which each in succession, taking off his shoes, advanced, and after saluting the company, fired, and then again saluted and withdrew. There was no avoiding the trial. They set for us the very smallest stones, and we fired without advancing from our places. M. L. and myself hit the mark in succession, and were vociferously commended, but we declined a second trial. Their muskets might be called rampart pieces. To cock one of their guns (there is no half-cock) is like arming an arbalette, or stringing a bow. In taking aim, they stretch out the left arm as far as they can reach, and hold out the right elbow higher than the ear, and in this awkward attitude are a long time levelling.

Two girls rushed up with kuscoussoo sieves to beat as tambourines ; \u2014 these are sheep's skin, pierced with holes, and caUed sonag.* A woman seizing one of the cooking jars drew off her slipper, and striking the open mouth with it, we had at once a tum-tum.

The crowd dispersed in an instant, not, however, before we had thrown some coins into the tambourine. The minstrel gallantly distributed them to the girls who had dis tinguished themselves. Some one brought him a skirt full of raisins and walnuts, which were heaped into his sieve. This he distributed amongst the younger portion of the audience.

Specimens are wanting of the African verse ; yet, considering that its effusions are numerous, inspired by Nature, and animated by national enthusiasm, they seem not unlikely to reward the care of the collector. The few examples actually given favour this conclusion. How small a number among our peasantry could have produced the pathetic and affecting lamentation, which was uttered in the little Bambarra cottage over the distresses of Park !

When a man is wanted, (as was often the case in arranging hunting parties,) his name is called quietly, as you sit within your canvass walls, thus : \" Eh !

The tent covering is in the longest forty feet, and somewhat less than twenty in width. It is in stripes lengthways, for the convenience of carriage. This cover is stretched over a transverse bar, supported by two upright poles in the form of the Greek letter II, under which generally hangs a curtain which divides the tent into two parts, each about fifteen feet square. The poles are ten or twelve feet high, the extremities of the covering coming to within two feet of the ground, where sometimes bundles of rushes are placed. The tent may be easily enlarged by adding a stripe or more to the covering, and then stretching out the hanging parts, but that would require the uprights and the pins to be strengthened. Thus, Isaiah (chap. liv. 2), \" Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not ; lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes.\" The stripes are unlaced when they remove their encampment and rolled up. The length of the tent is facing the centre of the circle. The form seems to have undergone a change. The gable, which is now transversely placed, must have formerly run through the length. At least so alone could the description of Sallust be correct, \"Oblonga incurvis kteribus tecta, quasi navium carin\u00e6.\" \u2014 The tents were formerly transported on waggons."], [474, "454 THE WORD \"HOME. CHAPTER V. THE TENT AND \" HOME.\" Few sounds awaken more pleasing associations than the tent of the Arab. Palace, castle, tower call up visions of events ; but \" tent \" drives the imagination back upon itself to discover in its own nature the resemblances and the method of the noblest men and the simplest manners. The tent, not the camel, is the ship of the desert ; the moveable home that makes the strangest spot familiar, the wildest habitable. One other word alone can be placed beside it \u2014 our English \"Home? Engaged in this reflection I inquired the Arabic name, and was answered, Heyme ! Home is in English an exotic. It is used adverbially as well as substantively. It applies in a manner inconsistent with a fixed abode, and evidently pertains to the system of Celtic ministry and nomade habits, rather than to feudalism. It belongs to a family with a moveable habitation. Home stands by itself as the name of a place\u2014 \" Ham House,\" \" the Ham Town,\" as in Northampton, Nottingham, Buckingham, Hampstead. I had observed"], [475, "THE WORD \"HOME.\" 455 that such names generally applied to a low, or a pro tected site. In the Highlands of Scotknd, within the memory of man, the pasturage was distributed between the two seasons ; the cattle being taken to the higher regions in the summer, the lower por tions being reserved for their support during the winter. The shieling was erected for the farm service in the summer ; the homestead, or hame, was the winter abode ; I had, therefore, concluded that home or hame was derived from hyems. I had been struck by a similar analogy in the Turkish word for castle, kishla, from kish. Winter was first applied to the solid buildings of the winter farm as contrasted with the yazin, or light shielings erected on the summer pasturage. This word, so peculiarly English, is not confined to England. It is used nearly in our adverbial sense throughout the north of Europe, and in our topographic sense in France. There is Ham, de Ham, as the names of places, and every village is their hameau. In Africa we have the same thing. El Ham, the name of a place (Algeria).

In the early times there was no difficulty in transferring usages and names. Each region was not replenished, nor each tongue complete. Hayme may come either from heat or cold ; it may mean \" the hot \" or \" the shady \" place. Chem or Ham, also, is hot. Ham was the name given to Egypt from its black soil. In northern India, Hima is cold.* Home serves as protection against cold and snow \u2014 against sun and heat. The tent may appear to us, with our city habits, the most primitive of dwellings ; but in considering the matter I should, I think, have arrived at an opposite conclusion, even if we had not had another distribution laid down in the oldest of books. There is first the emblem of a garden \u2014 a refuge under its bowers ; next, in the person of Cain, comes the planting of seeds ; then follows close, Abel tending the most peaceable of milk-giving animals \u2014 sheep. A third generation arrives, who make dwell ings : they build a city.

Jabal's brother was Jubal, the inventor of the harp and minstrelsy. Joyousness then followed the tent ; and immediately after comes industry with its forges and its cares, its sweats and profits ; and Tubal Cain taught men to smelt and puddle, and presented them with brass and steel. The Moorish tent is quite different from the Arab. It is of white cotton, and of the ordinary form of the officers' tent in all European armies. The curtain is more upright, and the roof slants up. The mechan ism is different. The cover and the curtain are in separate parts. The roof spreads out with a fringe hanging round it ; if shade only is required the curtains are not added. It stands as a large um brella ; the stem nine or ten feet high, and the top thirty feet in circumference. Against high winds they have guys or stays, which, like our cables of a ship, they lay out to windward. The operation of pitching commences with securing those stays, which are three in number ; then the cords of the umbrella are spread, and then the curtain is fitted round. It is between five and six feet deep, of double cloth ( strengthened by thin rods like the bones of ladies' stays, and one to each cord of the roof.

It is much more easily managed from being in two parts, and the superior and moveable stays are of the greatest advantage. Having cut out tents, and having more than once had to repair the loss of them by the work of my own servants, I am, perhaps, qualified beyond most dwellers in houses to speak on the subject.

The colour of these devices is blue. In the description of the Jewish Tabernacle we have exactly the Moorish manner of pitching. Blue is the first colour mentioned ; purple and red follow. But these may have been added as distinctive to the sacred tent, as they were to the priestly garments ; and as blue distinguished the common clothing of the Israelites, so might it be expected to be the mark of his tent.

This is precisely the manner in which the curtain of the Moorish tent is fitted to the roof, loop through loop all the way round, and the loops are not far from the above distance ; and, probably, in the larger fittings of the Sultan's establishment, they coincide with the dimensions laid down by Moses.

The sheik deploring the result of the day's hunt, I expressed the hope that we should make up for it next day ; on this they were thrown into paroxysms, and they set about the sheik, some by fair means, the rest by foul, to prevent my doing anything save going along the main road, or going any road except that to Dar el Baida, whither I had no particular wish to go. Despite these difficulties, I found means to con cert privately a chase for the next day. We were to be limited to twenty guns, and, with a good supply of beaters, to start early. In the morning, Sheik Tibi and the other soldiers, after using every effort to stop me, insisted on going also ; thus, the sun was high before we got a start. We drew two valleys with no T \u201er.r \u201e VOL II. B"], [490, "2 ARAB BOAKS. better success than the day before, expending two hours on each. Being satisfied that there was a pur pose in this, I persisted in trying further off, and being joined by thirty or forty men from the next tribe, the oath was administered and we proceeded. It was now a sight to see the boars, as they issued from each of two valleys simultaneously beaten, running about, listening and watching, starting and returning, as the roll of musketry came up from both sides : it was like shooting hares in a well-stocked preserve, without dogs. The scenery surpassed that of the day before. I was now quite at home with these people, and it was only after it was over, that we thought it might have been imprudent to start on such an ex pedition, without knowing a word of their language, and not only without, but in defiance of, the persons charged with the care of us. The boars enjoy a state of unparalleled happiness under the fostering shadow of Islamism and the law of Moses ; a law not so observed in ancient Jud\u00e6a as in Modern Morocco, as may be seen by the denunci ations of the Prophets \u2014 the occupation of the Prodigal Son and the selection made by the cast-out devils. These two laws have excluded from this region domes tic pigs and peopled it with wild ones. The Arabs hold them to be transformed men and infidels ; and converse with them, interpreting into words their grunts and motions. Each Arab, as he came up, soliloquised or addressed a curse to the car casses, as he would to a slaughtered doe. These"], [491, "THEIR STRENGTH AND DEXTERITY. 3 notions are natural enough, for they seem possessed of man's reason with brute's force. We had commonly an alarm at day-break of boars close to the douar, and though instantly pursued by dogs and horsemen, they managed to escape by speed, dodging, and short turns. They move through the bushes with a surprising faci- lity of avoiding noise, squeezing by strength and with their thick hides through places that appeared utterly impassable. They get over everything, through everything, and lie as close under cover as they are alert when up. In starting for a chase, the boys com- mence by plaiting the rush-like palm leaves into a sling, for it is only by stones that they can start them. No pigs are fed like these. They have the run of the forests of cork, producing the bellota and the pal- metto-root : they prefer, however, the potato-like root of the arain, which is called yerni, and grows gene- rally in the bunches of the palmetto. In substance it is like a milky turnip, of a sweetish and mawkish flavour. Next to this they feed on the narcissus, the plant of which is called bugareg, and the root bililouse. They like very much the loto, of which I have yet to speak, and therefore deserve the name of lotofagoi. It is called folilla. Their well-known predilection for turfel \u2014 truffles \u2014 would be gratified in the extreme, were it not that the taste of the Arab coincides with theirs. Every square yard contains these plants, and when the vegetation is dried up, these roots remain in the ground fresh and succulent. No wonder, then, that they prosper, with free quarters and full commons. B 2"], [492, "4 DESTRUCTION OF FORESTS The tribes of the Tahel are wood-destroyers. They consume constantly, and never plant. A portion of their fuel is brushwood ; but still the olive, the oak, and the arar, the remnants of primeval forests, daily dis appear. Around Rabat, not a tree is to be seen ; yet the firewood is the roots which are dug out of the plain. The copses, woods, and forests of the cork-tree, which I have traversed, will have disappeared in a very few years. This, however, is the effect of stripping them of their bark for exportation. It was saddening to pass through these groves, where the ancient patri arch of the forest was circled by the scalping-knife, which did not spare even the young promise by his side ; and, as if in savage ruthlessness, and not blinded avarice, they sought to ensure the decay of the tree. They had stripped the bark only to the height of a man, neglecting the rest. They seek the bark only for tanning. The cork stripped off was lying rotting around. The cork may be taken from the tree, with out injury, as it covers the real bark through which the sap runs. This the Spaniards never touch. Four years ago, this speculation was introduced by a French merchant. He offered 4,000 dollars for the liberty of exportation, besides four per cent. duty. The farm has risen this year to 25,000 dollars. The Arabs seemed shocked at this work, but avoided the subject with apparent uneasiness, whenever it was in troduced. I asked them why they did not plant trees for their children, as they were constantly destroying those that their fathers had left 1 The answer was,"], [493, "BY ARAB TRIBES. 5 \" It is not the custom ; if we planted them there would be nobody to watch them, and they would be destroyed.\" At present, large districts are destitute of douars from the deficiency of fuel. A considerable portion of the country I have passed over will soon be in the same condition, unless by the reduction' of the popula tion the forests are again allowed to spread. The ex tent of the change within a century is marked by the extinction of wild beasts. Travellers, a century ago, narrate that they did not dare to pass the night out of a douar for the lions and panthers. Reading these ac counts enables one to understand how the people of Palestine were not to be driven out before the Jews in one month or in one year, lest the beasts of the field should multiply against them. In the times of the Romans, the lions and panthers must have been as numerous as are now the boars.* The chief lady of the douar was too busy for cere mony ; \u2014 she left that department to her husband. She was first lieutenant. But one evening, as we were returning to the douar, she signified that she had something to say, and conducting me into the tent, made me sit down, and, seating herself opposite, said, \" Christian, \u2014 since the wives and daughters of your * When the Romans first saw lions and panthers, they called them African rats (Mitres Africanos).

It was Nature saying to Art, \" What is thy worth 1 \" What do we know of the happiness and the uses that belong to the drudgeries of life ?

There is no subdivision of labour \u2014 the household, not the man, is the mint of the state. It is so by its work, its varying cares, and interchanging toil. These impose discipline, nur ture affection, knit and fortify that unit. Take away these cares, this industry, this dexterity, this power of standing alone, and what will \u2014 what can \u2014 a \" home \" become, save a crib to sleep in, with a trough to feed at, supplied from the butcher's cart and the huckster's stall ? Take from the household its industrial charac ter, and you take away its social charm, and its public worth. You exchange domestic industry for political economy \u2014 that is, the fictitious evils which it classi fies : for habits you substitute laws, that is, cumbrous mockery : for happiness, refinement, that is, pretence : \u2014 and you become possessed of the gifts of fortune \u2014 the few at least who draw the prizes, only to lose the value, of life. The change in our manners is producing, no doubt, an alteration in the position as well as in the happi ness of women. From my first acquaintance with the East, I was struck with the erroneous notions which we entertain regarding the state of the sex there. I could not resist the evidence of their occupying relatively a higher station, and I perceived that the difference depended upon the greater strength of the family tie. I find in an official French work * my proposition strengthened. \" In all the Sahara, the fabrication of stuffs is * Exploration scientifique d'Algerie."], [496, "8 INDUSTRY IN THE SAHARA. exclusively the work of the women. The men apply themselves to the culture of the date-trees. It has been already shown that in the movements and expe ditions, the women have their share equally allotted to them with the men. Thus, in the produce of the labour of the Sahara, that of the women amounts to one-half. In the intervals of their necessary house hold occupations, they find time to contribute to the common riches an equal quantity with the men. This is a fact which it appears to us worthy of being placed in evidence, because it is impossible that it should remain without influence on the condition of the female sex. The inutility of the occupations in which they are engaged almost everywhere else, ex plains perhaps, to a certain degree, and excuses the state of dependence in which they are placed, and the disregard of which they are the object ; but where by the nature of the occupations they are placed upon a level equal with that of man, he must cease to regard himself as the sole chief of the domestic hearth, and be prepared to share the family sovereignty with his companion. It is certain that in the Sahara the merit of a woman is measured above all by her talents and dexterity.\" In Egypt all things were consecrate'd, and then displayed in types. The successive labours (as even to these days in Africa) were announced from the sanctuary, accompanied by sacrifices and proces sions, and amidst the richness of their ceremonials, and the pomp of their temples. The changes of the"], [497, "9 EGYPTIAN SYMBOLS. seasons which they announced, appeared to flow from their directing power, and the labours undertaken to be the fruit of their providential care. Before calendars were printed, all field labours had to be determined by astronomy, and especially in the valley of the Nile, which was subject to disappear under a deluge, and whose fertility consisted in the rise and duration of the flood. Placing ourselves in the soft and yielding, the unlearned and unprejudiced embryo of society ; man groping his way, fearful to stray, yet eager to advance, what more natural than a scientific priesthood and a symbolical worship % The Greeks, copying these fruit ful symbols, sacrificed purpose and usefulness to grace. The name of Moses, we are informed in Scripture, means saved from the water. The Muses was the same word : nine months in Egypt are saved from the ivaters \u2014 these are the Muses. Each had its festival, and the symbol of its occupation. There were three other similar \u2014 these are the Graces \u2014 they are admitted by the most learned Hellenists to be water-nymphs ; \u2014 together they make up the year. Here, then, we have the homeliest occupations the basis of the re ligious pomps of Egypt, and of the mythology and art of Greece ; the distribution of these works filled up the year, combined field and in-door labour, and linked the community, while furnishing the charm of life. The plough, the yoke, \" The invention of gods and the occupation of heroes ;\" are the loom, the spindle, and distaff of less noble parentage \\ You sever the"], [498, "10 ARAB COMPARED WITH distaff and the plough, the spindle and the yoke, and you get factories and poor-houses, credit and panics \u2014 two hostile notions, agricultural and commercial. Poetry becomes politics, patriotism faction ; and a light-hearted and contented people rusts into clowns or sharpens into knaves. I made, amongst the Arabs, the discovery that home industry was the secret of the permanency of their society. I made, on subsequently visiting the High lands, another, namely, that home-made stuffs are the cheapest. I refer, of course, to the common clothing of the labouring population. The comparison cannot be instituted where the habit has been extinguished ; for on the one hand, the implements and the dexterity are wanting; on the other, fashion has set another way, and new habits have arisen, adjusted to the articles and stuffs that have been introduced. In the Highlands, however, the comparison is easy, and I speak after thorough examination, and with perfect certainty, when I say that a family clothed by its own home work, as compared with a family which buys its clothes at the shop, saves one-third. Of course, in the former case, no cotton will be used, and home-bred wool and home-grown flax will be the staple. The change in this respect is generally deplored ; but it is considered as inevitable, it being the result of cheapness, no hand-labour being able to stand against machinery. But the heavy charges are not for the operation but for the capital engaged, and the nu merous transfers and profits.

The working class is thus amerced to support a wretched factory population, a parasitical, shopkeeping class, and a fictitious, commercial, mone tary, and financial system. The landlord, for his share, pays five shillings per acre poors-rates. And all this is the result, not of cheapness, but delusion.

A wheel was turned by one hand, whilst with the other the wool, cotton, or flax was prepared for the spindle : as each portion was twisted the wheel was reversed, so as to run it on the spindle ; but in the coil the thread passes through an orifice in the axis of the spindle, and is then carried by a bar to be distributed over the pirn. The wheel runs always on, and when yielded by the fingers, passes to the coil. Both hands are free for the work.

Hallam has admitted that in those times which we look back on with pity, the labourer received twice as much as at present for his labour. This is a terrible blow and a fearful avowal. Mr. Macaulay, on the contrary, \" sees nothing but progress, hears of nothing but decay.\" He must have transposed the two senses, or carefully selected the spots for indulging in their use : if, indeed, by progress he means approach towards a fair remuneration for labour, and by decay a falling away from just judgment in important concerns. Or is it his purpose to cover Hallam 's indiscretion? \u2014 \" They say that in former times the people were better off. The time will come that they will say the same of this.\" If we be in a state of progress, those who speak thus must be very foolish, and if the proposi tion deserved notice it required refutation. The Arab tent, without our waking follies, presents to us the reality of our dreams. Property has there its value, wealth its honour, labour its reward. On the one side, the fruits of wisdom without effort, on the other the toil of the understanding without profit. But the Arab woman asked, \" Are your women hap pier than we ?\" The European lady would be shocked at the bare possibility of comparison. She shrinks from domestic occupation, yet is she not able to expel nature, so as to despise Nausicaa and Naomi.

Yet, if our condition be that of refinement, how contemptible must be Tanaquil and her distaff, Penelope and her loom ?

But I do not speak of \" civilization,\" as an entity. It will be found in no classical writer, Greek or Roman, English or French, German or Italian. It is a word which belongs to us, \u2014 exclusively to us; let us be either proud or conscious \u2014 its invention must be either a merit or a shame. What is it? It is no standard. We have the words \" excellence,\" and \" perfection.\" It is no de scription of a particular people, for it neither does nor can describe or define. Its own sense has to be defined. Whoever uses the word, conjures up to cor respond with it an idea of some aggregate condition, which never can have the same parts in any two speakers' minds, or in the mind of the same speaker at any two moments. It is an unknown quantity, like x in algebra ; but instead of concluding the operation by finding out its value, we commence the proposition by supposing it known.

Our guardians inquired from the shepherds touching different douars, to select one for sleeping, but did not seem satisfied with the replies. I urged going to one of the Lachedumbra, a tribe of the Ladzian, and they reluctantly complied. This was the first douar we approached as perfect strangers. We rode up to within two hundred paces and halted. After we had waited about ten minutes we advanced half way and halted again. Then one man walked slowly out ; one of our party in like manner advanced. They saluted. After some time the Arab shouted, and instantly a single man advanced from each of the tents on the side next us : they stood for some minutes as if holding council. The chief then turned round, and walking straight up to me, took my hand in their manner, and thrice repeated Mirababick ; the others"], [507, "19 LADZIAN DOUARS. then advanced, and pronounced the salutation all together. Each of the party was thus greeted in turn. We were led inside. The whole douar set to work, and in a few minutes our tent was pitched, and strewed with fresh shrubs. A sheep was led up to the door, the customary present of the sheik, that we might see it before we made our supper on it. This was a Sherriff's douar, and the government officers have no right to enter. Such was the explanation given to me. It is difficult to ascertain, and impossible to vouch for, the commonest fact in a country where one is not thoroughly conversant with its habits, and when information is received through interpreters, however intelligent and upright these may be ; and, indeed, integrity is next to an impossibility in an interpreter ; but this an eastern traveUer learns, if at all, at the wrong end of his experience. I have seen no douar entered except by the free will, and in some cases the formal consent, of the tribe. I was much perplexed at this, as it appeared at first a contradiction to, and as I afterwards ascer tained, modification of the fundamental rule of Arab society. It doubtless arose from the necessity of defence against a central government After they had pitched our tent, instead of pressing upon us as amongst the Ziaida, they drew off about thirty yards, and squatted down in a circle : a few only came, and then it was to bring presents, or to petition for medicine for a greasy heel, or a barren wife, as the case might be. I proposed to the sheik a c 2"], [508, "20 DAR EL BAIDA. boar hunt, to which he readily assented ; but it was fixed for a future day. From the high ground, as we approached it, Dar El Baida has an imposing appearance : inside it is a heap of ruins. A house consisting of a single room \u2014 a good one on a second floor, and entered from a terrace \u2014 was prepared for us. Our horses were piqueted in the street before it. We understood there was a French Consular agent and some Europeans here, and conse quently we brought for them a camel-load of game. This place is said to have been retaken from the Portuguese by the following stratagem. A Moor pre tended to become Christian, settled in the town, and obtained permission to have a gate opened in the wall close to his house for the convenience of sending in and out his flocks. He one night brought in a number of his countrymen covered with hides, as cattle among them. Such is the story of the place ; and if you doubt it, they say, \" There is the gate.\" The Spanish name is Casa Bianca, just as if we chose to call it \" White House.\" Its ancient name, \"Anafe,\" involves some obscurity. The same name belonged to a colony in Asia Minor, and to an island close to Crete, which forms an episode in the Orphic epic of the Argonauts. The adventurers were rescued by Apollo, who discharging an arrow into the deep, the island arose, and was called Anafe, from uvutpumiv, to appear. What this etymology is worth for the Cretan Island, it must also be for the Lybian promon tory : its present name likewise implies brightness.

The Ph\u0153nician Backs and Parrys did not dot their charts with the names of the Admiralty Lords of Tyre. They gave names de scriptive or commemorative, as the other names of this coast will vouch.

Ampelusa was on the northern promontory, and its ynterpreta tion coincides with the descriptions left of groves delightful to the eye, filled with fruit grateful to the taste.

Would that the resemblance were complete ! If Moor ish rule has blasted the oak, it has at least spared the man. What Moorish rule has worst done it has done with a purpose, and neither on principle nor for phi lanthropy. A quantity of grain was in store, and much arriv ing destined for England. The stores were filled all along the coast, but there are no means of shipment. This port is a principal place for the exportation of bark and wool, both managed by Scheik Tibi, who, last season, when the country was otherwise impass able, went and came, conducting caravans of seventy and eighty camels ; by his personal character ensur ing safety on the road. The schooner which had been in company with us during our voyage, lay on the beach high and dry. An English brig at anchor in the open roadstead was pitching bows under, though there was scarcely a breath of wind, and had nar rowly escaped shipwreck two days before from her cables having been cut by the rocks. There is here a sort of bay. The southern horn is a headland running a little way out, and distant four or five miles. On its bald black brow I was told that traces of the Ph\u0153nician city were to be seen. I was all impatience to reach the spot, for it was just a site for * Ireland was anciently known as Fiodha Inis, or the Woody Island."], [511, "23 TRACES OF A PH\u0152NICIAN CITY. them, and no one since would have gone there. So here was the site of a Lybo- Ph\u0153nician city, and any fragment was precious. I found nothing standing, yet was not disappointed ; for the stones in the fields were rolled fragments of building : the mortar was of such consistency that it wore or split only with the stones imbedded in it, and these were crystalline : the stones were small, the mortar abundant ; the masses looked like amygdaloid. For the first time was I assured that I beheld a piece of Tyrian rubble. I would have tra velled many a mile for this. Mortar was used by them \u2014 and what mortar ! But this was not the only architectural point I had to mark this day. As I sat on the brow of the headland, watching the great waves which went and came over long shelves of rocks, stretching out to the west and southward in the line of the declining sun, and playing under his rays, my eye was attracted to a singular mass immediately below : it was a cone indented all over with deep semicircular cavities, and, therefore, bristling with truncated points. The sandstone hollows out in this manner* by the action of the water, and the points which are left are sharp as a knife. The substance is black and porous, like a sponge. When the foam dashed over this rock, the basins filled ; the white froth, as the wave retired, poured in cataracts from basin to * The \" Chaudiere Palls\" are so called from cavities like kettles hollowed out by stones of harder consistency getting into a hollow, and there revolving by the action of the water.

As I watched these changes, familiar forms floated before me, till at last becoming more distinct, I distinguished those singular pen dants that belong to the Moorish vault, and the inden tures of its arch. The stalactites of caverns might have furnished the type of the last, but could not of the former. The fair creations of art have models in Nature, and here is that of the Moorish. The sub stance in which it is exhibited lines the whole coast, and must present an infinite variety of such effects. I had few occasions of seeing that coast, but the very next time I reached it, about twenty miles north of Rabat, I saw the same figure reversed, or as we see it in the Moresco vault, depending from the roof like the stalactites in a cave.* I returned to the same place next morning, but the tide was out, and the rock without the foam was a common stone. The ledges of rock which the evening before had been so lashed by the waves, were white (quartz) rock. On them were patches of coarse recent madrepores, looking like gigantic sponges. Further out the rocks were black, and on inspection proved to be so because completely covered with mussels, the * These pensile figures are by all writers on Moorish architec ture held to be an imitation of stalactite.

Such is the fury of the waves, that beautifully rounded quartz-stones, some of them three-quarters of a hundred weight, have been cast up into a bank thirty feet above high-water-mark. Amongst the mass of ruins within the walls of Dar el Baida one building alone could be made out. It was a bath. If London or Paris were laid low, no such monument would survive of their taste, luxury, or cleanliness. The people called it \" Roman,\" meaning Portuguese. When I was at Algesiras, some excavations were making, and on examining them, the building proved to be a bath. Within the circuit of the walls of old Ceuta, which unquestionably belonged to a very remote period, the only edifice, the purpose of which is distinguishable, is a bath.

From what I know of the loss in both respects which those incur who"], [514, "26 MOORISH AND TURKISH BATHS. have it not, I can estimate its worth to those who had it. I now had the opportunity of examining a public bath of the Moors belonging to their good times- The disposition varies from that of the ancient Therm\u00e6 and the modern Hamams. The grand and noble portion of the Turkish and the ancient bath was a dome, open to the heavens in the centre. Such a one, but not open in the centre, is here ; it was the inner not the outer apartment. The vault has deep ribs, in the fashion of a clam shell, and is supported upon columns with horse-shoe arches spreading be tween. Instead of a system of flues through the walls, only one passed through the centre under the floor. To get at it, I had to break through the pavement of beaten mortar covering a slab of marble. It was nearly filled up with a deposit, partly of soot and partly of earthy matter, which I imagined to be the residuum of gazule, on the use of which hinge the peculiarities I have noticed in the structure and dis tribution of the building. I turned to Leo Africanus, expecting a flood of light upon a matter with which he must have been so familiar. All I found was this : \u2014 \" When any one is to be bathed, they lay him along the ground, anoint ing him with certain ointment and with certain instruments clearing aivay his filth.\" The ointment is evidently the gazule ; the instrument can only be the strigil. He mentions a \" Festival of the Baths.\" The servants and officers go forth with trumpets and"], [515, "27 THE GAZULE AND STRIGIL. pipes, and all their friends, to gather a wild onion ; it is put in a brazen vessel, covered over with a linen cloth, which had been steeped in lees of wine ; this they bring with great solemnity and rejoicings, and suspend in the vessel in the portal of the bath. This would indicate an Egyptian source, were it not for the absence of all trace of the bath on their storied walls, and among their ruins. The onion, however, being the emblem of the pla netary system,* may be a trace of Sab\u00e6ism. The festival and ceremony savour much of those of the \" Great Mother,\" and of course preceded Christians. No original superstition arose here ; no original bath appears among the Arabs. The Ph\u0153nicians brought their religion and found the bath, and to it the people adapted the new religious practices. Part of the funereal rites of the Moors was to convey the corpse to the bath.f Such a practice is unknown in any other country, and seems to identify the bath with the primitive usages. The gazule furnishes, however, the strongest intrin sic evidence in favour of my conclusion, which in deed it requires but scanty proof to establish, for the rudest people may have had the bath. The Red Indians are fully acquainted with it, and the means * The slices representing the orbits of the planets. We have derived our word from On i on ; a reduplication of On, the Sun, in his chief temple in the city, called after him, where the onion, being the symbol, was supposed to be worshipped. t Mision Historial de Marueccos, p. 45."], [516, "28 THE STRIGIL. they employ are heated stones and a leather covering. They crawl in and throw water on the stones, and soak till the same effect is produced as the Balnea of Rome obtained. In Morocco they are of primitive and mo dest structure, and of diminutive proportions. Add to this, the rude simplicity of the process, and the ex clusive use in them of natural and native productions. Before coming to this point, I wish to refer to historical evidence. Augustus borrowed a stool, called duretum,* from Spain. Mauritania was inhabited by the same people, so that two thousand years ago the Romans copied the Moors. Few Iberian words have come down to us \u2014 one of them is strigil. It applied to a species of metal ; and strigils were made of metal. The early use of this strigil, and its connection with the East, is shown by one of the celebrated bronzes of antiquity \u2014 a group of two boys in the bath using the strigil, which was attributed to D\u00e6dalus, f The Etruscans and Lydians also had it.

Homer mentions their baths at the time of the Trojan war, when the Greeks had none. The term 'Hgot,x.\\eia Kourga seems to identify baths with that people as much as letters were by the term Kal^siu ygappuru ; and as the Greeks got everything from them, the baths of the Greeks are in themselves a testimony in favour of the Ph\u0153nicians, my inference being, not that the Ph\u0153nicians brought thither the tice, but that they learnt it here. That the Arabs, when they issued from their deserts, should have adopted the Therm\u00e6 and Balnea of the sinking Roman empire, does not necessarily follow ; indeed it is rather to be assumed that they would not, and that it was from a people who became by religion incorporated with them, and from whom, indubitably, they derived their architecture, that they had it. This view is supported by the use of the glove, which is not Roman, and the disuse of the strigil, which was so. It would thus appear that Morocco had con ferred on antiquity and the East of the present day, the chief luxury of the one, and the most beneficial habit of the other. There being a bath in the unoccupied house of the Governor of the Province, I made the attempt to com plete my investigation by experience, and privately applied to the guardian of the mansion, who, to my surprise, immediately acceded to my request.

Arrived at the place, he took the keys from his breast, and opened the doors. I thought his care was to end here, but he squatted himself down on a mat in an outhouse, as if to wait the issue.

Cleanliness has the characters of virtue and of vice \u2014 it is at once beneficial and seductive. It is also a science and an art, for it has an order which has to be taught, and it requires dexterity and im plements. It has its prejudices and superstitions : it abhors what is not like itself, and clings to its practices under a secret dread of punishment and fear of sin. It has its mysteries and its instincts : it regards not the eye or favour of man, and follows the bent of its nature without troubling itself with reasons for what it does ; it has its charities and its franchises : the poorest is not without the reach of its aid, nor the most powerful strong enough to infringe its rights* * A bronze statue of a bather by Lysippus was removed by Tiberius from the baths of Agrippa to his own palace, and VOL.

We must look for one tested by long experience and fixed from ancient days : \u2014 this standard is the bath. This is no ideal one ; it is at once theory and performance ; he who has gone through it, knows what it is to be clean because he is cleansed.

A people who know neither Latin nor Greek have preserved this great monument of antiquity on the soil of Europe, and present to us who teach our chil dren only Latin and Greek, this institution in all its Roman grandeur, and its Grecian taste.

I shall not weary the reader with ground plans or \" elevations,\" and shall confine myself to the leading features, in so far as they are connected with use. They are vast and of costly materials, from their very nature. Before describing the Moorish bath, I must request the reader to accompany me through the bath as it is used by the Turks, which, as more com plete and detailed, is more intelligible. The operation consists of various parts : first, the seasoning of the body; second, the manipulation of the muscles ; third, the peeling of the epidermis ; fourth, the soaping, and the patient is then conducted to the bed of repose. These are the five acts of the drama. There are three essential apartments in the building : a great hall or mustaby, open to the outer air ; a middle chamber, where the heat is moderate ; the inner hall, which is properly the therm\u00e6. The first scene is acted in the middle chamber ; the next three in the inner chamber, and the last in the outer hall. The time occupied is from two to four hours, and the operation is repeated once a week. On raising the curtain which covers the entrance to the street, you find yourself in a hall circular, octa gonal, or square, covered with a dome open in the centre : it may be one hundred feet in height ; the Pantheon of Rome may be taken as a model. This is the apodyterium, conclave or spoliatorium of the"], [527, "39 THE TURKISH BATH. Romans. In the middle, a basin of water, the \"sea\" of the Jews, the \" piscinum \" of the Romans, is raised by masonry about four feet ; a fountain plays in the centre. Plants, sometimes trellises, are trained over or around the fountain, and by it is placed the stall to supply coffee, pipes, or nargelles. All round there is a platform, varying in breadth from four to twelve feet, and raised about three ; here couches are placed, which I shall presently describe. You are conducted to an unoccupied couch to undress ; your clothes are folded and deposited in a napkin and tied up ; you are arrayed in the bathing costume, which consists of three towels about two yards long and under a yard in width, thickened in the centre with pendant loops of the thread, so as to absorb the moisture, soft and rough without being flabby or hard, with broad borders in blue or red of raw silk. This gives to this costume an air of society, and takes from it the stamp of the laundry or wash-house. One is wrapped with an easy fold round the head, so as to form a high and peculiar, but not ungraceful turban ; the second is bound round the loins, and falls to the middle of the leg ; this is the ordinary costume of the attendants in the bath, and appears to be the costume known in antiquity as iri^iZu^a, pr\u0153cinctorium, and subliga culum, and which have been of difficult interpreta tion, as implying at once a belt and a clothing. The third is thrown over the shoulder like a scarf : they are called Pistumal, as are all towels, but the proper name is Futa, a word borrowed, as the stuff is, from"], [528, "40 DESCRIPTION OF Morocco. While you change your linen, two attendants hold a cloth before you. In these operations, which appear to dispense of necessity with clothing and concealment, the same scrupulous attention is ob served. It extends to the smallest children. I have been on a bathing excursion to the sea -side, where a child under four years was disappointed of his dip because his bathing drawers had been forgotten. There is nothing which more shocks an Eastern than our want of decorum ; and I have known instances of servants assigning this as a reason for refusing to remain in Europe, or to come to it. Thus attired, you step down from the platform height ; wooden pattens, \u2014 nalma in Turkish, cob cob in Arabic, \u2014 are placed for your feet, to keep you off the hot floors, and the dirty water running off by the entrances and passages ; two attendants take you, one by each arm above the elbow \u2014 walking behind and holding you.

Each person is preceded by a mattress and a cushion, which are removed the moment he has done with them, that they may not get damp. The apartment he now enters is low and small ; very little light is admitted ; sometimes, indeed, the day is excluded, and the small flicker of a lamp enables you to perceive indistinctly its form and occupants. The temperature is moderate, the moisture slight, the marble floor on both sides is raised about eighteen inches, the lower and centre part being the passage between the two halls. This is the"], [529, "41 A TURKISH BATH. tepidarium. Against the wall your mattress and cushion are placed, the rest of the chamber being similarly occupied : the attendants now bring coffee, and serve pipes. The object sought in this apartment is a natural and gentle flow of perspiration ; to this are adapted the subdued temperature and moisture ; for this the clothing is required, and the coffee and pipe ; and, in addition, a delicate manipulation is undergone, which does not amount to shampooing : the sombre air of the apartment calms the senses, and shuts out the external world.* During the subsequent parts of the operation, you are either too busy or too abstracted for society ; the bath is essentially sociable, and this is the portion of it so appropriated \u2014 this is the time and place where a stranger makes acquaintance with a town or village. * One of the luxuries of the Roman baths consisted in their brightness, the command of the prospect around, and in various strange contrivances. By one of these, the bather, while swimming in warm water, could see the sea ; by another, the figures of the bathers within, were seen magnified without. \" They were not content unless they were coloured as well as washed,\" says Seneca (Epist. 87).

This I have observed, that wherever the bath is used it is not confined to any class of the commu nity, as if it was felt to be too good a thing to be denied to any. I must now conduct the reader into the Moorish bath. First, there was no bath linen. They go in naked. Then there is but one room, under which there is an oven, and a pot, open into the bath, is boiling on the fire below. There were no pattens \u2014 the floor burning hot \u2014 so we got boards. At once the operation com menced, which is analogous to the glove. There was a dish of gazule, for the shampooer to rub his hands in. I was seated on the board, with my legs straight out before me ; the shampooer seated himself on the same board behind me, stretching out his legs. He then made me close my fingers upon the toes of his feet, by which he got a purchase against me, and rubbing his hands in the gazule, commenced upon the middle of my back, with a sharp motion up and down, be tween beating and rubbing, his hands working in opposite directions.

After rubbing in this way the skin, and stretching at the same time the joints of my upper body, he came and placed himself at my feet, dealing with my legs in like manner. Then thrice taking each leg and lifting it up, he placed his head under the calf, and raising himself, scraped the leg as with a rough brush, for his shaved head had the grain downwards. The operation concluded by his biting my heel. The bath becomes a second nature, and long priva tion so increases the zest, that I was not disposed to be critical ; but, if by an effort of the imagination I could transport the Moorish bath to Constantinople, and had then to choose between the hamam of Eshi Serai or my own at home, and this one of the Moors, I must say, I never should see the inside of a Moorish bath again.

The details of these wonderful structures, the evidences of their usefulness, have prompted no prince, no people of Europe to imitate them, and so acquire honour for the one, health for the other.

From what I have said, the identity of the Turkish bath, with that of the Romans, will be at once perceived, and the apparent discrepancies and differ ences explained. The apoclyterium is the mustaby or entrance-hall ; after this comes the sweating apartment, subdivided by difference of degrees. Then two operations are performed, shampooing, and the clearing off of the epidermis. The Romans had in the tepidarium and the sudatorium distinct atten dants for the two operations ; the first shampooer receiving the appropriate name of tractator ; the others, who used the strigil, which was equivalent to the glove, being called suppetones. The appearance of the strigil in no way alters the character of the operation. They used sponges also for rubbing down, like the Moorish gazule. They used no soap ; neither do the Moors ; \u2014 the Turks use it after the operation is concluded. The Laconicum I understood when I saw the Moorish bath, with the pot of water, heated from the fire below, boiling up into the bath. 1 then recollected that there is in the Turkish baths an opening, by which the steam from the boilers can be let in, although not frequently so used, nor equally placed within observation. Many of the Turkish baths have, doubtless, been originally Greek. The change in respect to the use of cold water is com pensated for * by the cold air of the outer room, into * \" On entering, they remain in the hot air, after which they immerse themselves in hot water, then they go into cold water,"], [543, "55 ROMAN BATH. which the Turks come, and is preserved in the partial use of cold water for the feet. The hot-water reser voirs, the labrum and solium, are still to be seen in the private baths ; they are in those of the Al hambra. When used, the character of running water, an essential point among the Turks, is given to them, by a hole being left below, which is unplugged, and a stream kept running in above from a> cock. It would appear that the Romans followed the same method. The piscinum of the Romans is found in the Moorish gardens. In the use of depilatories, or the shaving ' off the hair, the practice of the Turks is exactly that of the Romans ; the parts of the bath appropriated to that purpose being the same. The olearea are alone wanting. The Mussulmans would consider this smearing of the body with oil or oint ments not as a part of the bath, but a defilement, for which the purification of the bath was requisite.* The Romans used the bath to excess, taking it daily; the Mussulmans restricted its use to once a-week. The Romans entered the bath naked ; the Mussulmans have introduced a bathing costume ; the and then wipe off the sweat. Those who do not go from the sudatory at once into cold water, burst out on returning to the dressing-room, into a second sweat, which at first is immoderate, and then ceases and leaves them chilly.\" \u2014 Galen, Method. Med. 1. x. c. 2. * While it is essential to cleanliness to clear away the oily matter that exudes from the skin, the oil afterwards applied to the body, seems to be beneficial, and to keep open instead of closing the pores."], [544, "56 THE HEAD AS CONNECTED WITH Romans allowed the two sexes to enter promiscuously, the Mussulmans have wholly separated them. Pre serving the good, they have purified it from excesses, which, to a people of less discrimination, might have appeared to constitute its essential characters, or to be entailed as its necessary consequences. Our studies and learning have furnished us with no such results. These very excesses have been assigned as a reason for the disuse of the bath by the early Christians. If the explanation were true, the difference between the Christians and the Mussulmans would amount to this, that the first could see and reject the evil, the second perceive and select the good. There is one point connected with the bath on Avhich I must say a few words, especially as in this case our usages do not present any obstacle to the adoption of a good habit, and I have repeatedly had the gratification of finding that the suggestions which follow were of use. Those who wash the rest of their body, often except the head ; \u2014 the practice of smearing it with oil almost universally prevails. The Easterns do the reverse \u2014 they shave it. A greater comfort there cannot be than a bald pate. Washing the head is in no case prejudicial. Unless you wash the head, the washing of the body is neither complete nor satisfactory : the refreshment of washing the head may often be pro cured when it is impossible to wash the body.

You cover it up ! The fur of animals thickens and strengthens when exposed to air and wet. Your hair falls off, and you oil it. If it grows weak, change its habits. If it is not washed, and if it is oiled, begin to wash it, and leave off oiling it. Every week an Eastern lady has her hair thoroughly washed at the bath. It is first well soaped and rubbed. They are very particular about soap, and use none but that made of olive oil. The Castile soap, which in this country is sold at the apothecary's, is the soap the least injurious to the skin. This is twice repeated. After the soap, they apply a paste of Armenian bole and rose-leaves. This is rubbed into the roots of the hair, and left to imbibe all the grease of the head ; it is then, like the soap, washed off with bowls of hot water, and leaves the locks perfectly clean and silken. From time to time they dye it. On these occasions an attendant mixes up a handful of henna-dust in hot water, and thoroughly smears with it the hair, which is then turned up into a ball and bound tightly with a napkin. In this state they go through the bath. When the napkin is removed, and the henna-paste washed out, the hair, if before black, will have become of a bronze auburn, and if grey, red. The bath occupies from three to four hours, with the smoking, chatting, music, and dancing, which accompany it, in"], [546, "58 THE BATH OF EASTERN LADIES. an atmosphere that excludes every unpleasant sensa tion. The women are not, like the men, contented with the bathing-linen and apparatus, which they find there ; but are followed by female slaves, who bear bundles of towels in silk and satin wrappers, boxwood pattens, incrusted with mother of pearl, silver basins and bowls, or sometimes enamelled ones, and aloe-wood and ambergris to perfume both the apartment and their coffee. This finery is less than what they indulge in in their private baths. The Romans and Greeks, in like manner, were accompanied by their slaves, and did not trust to the service of the therm\u00e6. Each person brought his strigil and his anointing vase (strigilis et ampulla, \"Kr,xv6og xa.) fa<rrf\u00ab),* or sent them by his slave.

Rome was indebted to her strigil as well as her sword for the conquest of the world. This constant washing occasions, it may be sup posed, an enormous waste of water. A Turk uses less water than an English gentleman. It is true, every Turk, high and low, uses the same quantity, and washes in the same manner ; but the utensils and conveniences are differently adapted. There are no wash-hand basins and ewers in bedrooms, no foot pans, hip-baths, shower-baths, &c. They do not dabble in dirty water, defiling a great quantity. They wash under a stream of water, running from a fountain, urn, or ewer. A handful serves to moisten the soap and to rub with it, and a couple more rinse it com pletely off. The fountains are placed in the pas sages, staircases, &c. By the mosques, and in the streets, they are so arranged that, by sitting on a step, you can wash the feet and the head. When you wash in a room, one attendant brings the basin, laen, with its pierced cover and kneels before you ; another the ewer, ibrik, with its long, narrow neck to pour the water.* In the bath, steam and perspiration cleanse, * I find the most convenient substitute, a vase holding about two gallons of water, with a spout like that of a tea-urn, only three times the length, placed on a stand about four feet high, with a tub below : hot or cold water can be used ; the water may be very hot, as the stream that flows is small.

There is an impression that the bath is weaken ing. We can test this in three ways ; its effects on those debilitated by disease, on those exhausted by fatigue, and on those who are long exposed to it. 1. In affection of the lungs and intermittent fever, the bath is invariably had recourse to against the debilitating nightly perspirations. The temperature is kept low, not to increase the action of the heart or the secretions; this danger avoided, its effect is to subdue by a healthy perspiration in a waking state the unhealthy one in sleep. No one ever heard twice, and would often be found in a profuse sweat at twelve or one o'clock at night. The bath might be adopted for horses. The Muscovites used to mount from the dinner table on horse back ; at present we shampoo our horses, and clear off the epider mis, while we bestow no such care on our own bodies. VOL. II.

After long and severe fatigue \u2014 that fatigue such as we never know \u2014 successive days and nights on horseback \u2014 the bath affords the most astonishing relief. Having performed long journeys on horse back, even to the extent of ninety-four hours, with out taking rest, I know by experience its effects in the extremest cases. A Tartar, having an hour to rest, prefers a bath to sleep. He enters as if drugged with opium, and leaves it, his senses cleared, and his strength restored as much as if he had slept for several hours. This is not to be attributed to the heat or moisture alone, but to the shampooing, which in such cases is of an ex traordinary nature. The Tartar sits down and doubles himself up ; the shampooer (and he selects the most powerful man) then springs with his feet on his shoulders, cracking his vertebr\u00e6 ; with all his force and weight he pummels the whole back, and then turning him on his back and face, aided by a second shampooer, tramples on his body and limbs : the Tartar then lays himself down for half an hour ; and, perhaps, though that is not necessary, sleeps. Well can I recall the hamam doors which I have entered, scarcely able to drag one limb after the other, and from which I have sprung into my saddle again, elastic as a sinew and light as a feather.

The shampooers spend eight hours daily in the steam ; they undergo great labour there, shampoo ing, perhaps, a dozen persons, and are remarkably healthy. They enter the bath at eight years of age : the duties of the younger portion are light, and chiefly outside in the hall to which the bathers retire after the bath ; still, there they are from that tender age exposed to the steam and heat, so as to have their strength broken, if the bath were debilitating. The best shampooer under whose hands I have ever been, was a man whose age was given me as ninety, and who, from eight years of age, had been daily eight hours in the bath. This was at the natural baths of Sophia. I might adduce in like manner the sugar bakers in London, who in a temperature not less than that of the bath, undergo great fatigue, and are also remarkably healthy. The Romans furnish another example. Unlike the Arabs, who restrict its use to once a week, they went into it daily. The temperature was gradually raised, until in the time of Nero it came to be excessive. Their habits in other respects were not such as to be conducive to health, and must have disqualified them for enduring the bath : if it did debilitate, it served therefore as an antidote to their manner of life, and relieved the excess of the Patrician, as it does to-day the fatigue of the Tartar. F 2"], [556, "68 IMPORTANCE OF Life is chemical and galvanic, but both these agen cies result in, and depend upon, motion : the vessels are constructed for conveying fluids, the muscles for generating power.

The physical superiority of the aristocracy of England may be owing to a similar cause, cleanliness being with us a mark of station.

And this may be considered as one part of its curative virtues, having the faculty of calming the disturbed spirit without extinguishing, and indeed while in creasing, the dispositions to cheerfulness. Reader ! consider that this is not a drug in a shop, to be exhibited by prescription after a visit to a patient. It would be something if I suggested a new simple, or an improved plan of administer ing a known remedy in any one disorder. It would be much by such a suggestion to diminish in a few cases the pains of sciatica or of rheumatism, the tor tures of gout or stone ; what I suggest, is a habit, one which shall become, when adopted, that of the whole people. A bath might be had for one quarter of the price of a glass of gin ; for we have water in more abund ance, and at a cheaper rate than at Rome. To substantiate this estimate, I prepared some calculations, but having visited the baths and wash houses recently established, I find the case illustrated to my hand by practice, and affording an entire confirmation of all, and more than all, that I have said. It is not long since that there was not a hot bath to be got in London under two shillings; what would then have been said if any one had had the hardihood to advance, that hot baths might be got for two-pence ? and that bathing establishments, charg-"], [564, "76 RECENT BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES ing from one penny for cold baths up to sixpence, should become profitable concerns % Such nevertheless is the fact. There is here no new idea, no new pro cess, no new demands : it has simply been suggested to build larger establishments, and to throw them open at a smaller sum ; so that we have hitherto been deprived of these advantages through the partial blindness of those who have, in as far as they do see, deplored the blindness of others, not thinking that probably other films intercepted their own sight. I will therefore take the result obtained in these baths and wash-houses, as the basis of the calcula- tion which I wish to establish. For a thousand baths, the charge for water varies from twenty to twenty-eight shillings ; the coals for fuel from fif- teen to thirty shillings ; the other charges from fifteen to twenty shillings. In all these cases, the lower sum is of course above what the charge will be when experience has pointed out improvements and economy. Taking the most economical of these esta- blishments, we have baths at the rate of fifty shil- lings a thousand, that is, at a little more than a halfpenny a piece. The allowance of water for each bath is forty-five gallons ; fuel enters for one-third into the charge : reducing these charges to what would be incurred in the Turkish bath, there would be a saving of eight-ninths for the water, and pro pably five-sixths for the fuel, and an entire saving for the charge of attendance for the poorer classes, (the atavrout; ficckvivaovvTis) ; thus we should have on"], [565, "77 ESTABLISHED IN LONDON. the thousand baths, the charge for water and fuel reduced from thirty-five to five shillings ; and the charge of attendance being withdrawn from the poorer classes, the expense incurred would amount to one penny for sixteen baths, or four baths for a farthing. Here I am going upon the data supplied by these bathing establishments, where the water is furnished to them at a very low price, namely, fifteen shillings for the one thousand barrels, of thirty gallons, and where the coals consumed are of an inferior quality, at nine shillings a ton; and these are the points in which England and its capital possess such great advantages. In these establishments they can furnish between one and two thousand baths a-day, at an outlay of 15/. or 16/. a-week ; and as the experi ment has so far so well succeeded, two hundred of them would supply London, at the rate of a bath to each person, weekly, for which the weekly expen diture would be 3000/. or 150,000/. per annum, which would occasion a daily use of 126,000,000 of gallons of water. In the Turkish manner, the expen diture of water would be 15,000,000 ; and taking the proportionate saving in fuel, there would be a saving of one half the outlay, or 75,000/. a-year ; but, as the facility thus afforded, and the habits so engendered, would lead in our climate, and in our circumstances, to a much more frequent use of the bath than once a-week, and as it would constantly be had recourse to by the lower orders, without their"], [566, "78 LOW PRICE AT WHICH going through the whole process, the establishments would have to be proportionately larger, and the expenditure greater. At all events, it is now no longer a theoretical matter : these baths are in use, and are extending ; and the question is, whether we shall introduce a perfect instead of a defective method \u2014 an economical instead of an expensive one. But, if this new charge be incurred, we have, on the other side, to look forward to the possibility of retrenchments in consequence of the altered habits of the people. The one that first presents itself is the diminution of maladies, doctors' and apothecaries' fees and drugs, loss of time from sickness, and attendance ; \u2014 and here, to say nothing of the different value of life, the saving for London alone will have to be reckoned by millions. Next are temperance and so- briety. At first sight the connection will not appear so immediate ; it will, however, be unquestionable to those familiar with countries where the bath is in use.

One of these effects would have been, that to-day in London there would be no gin-palaces, and a thousand baths. In London and its suburbs there are nearly two millions of inhabitants ; of these, one million and a half at least cannot afford those baths which we use.* Deducting a fifth for infants under forty days old, and persons confined to bed, there would remain twelve hundred thousand, so that two hundred thousand bodies, which now carry their filth from the cradle to the grave, would be daily washed. Judging by the scale of prices at Constantinople f or Rome, the cost of a bath might begin from one penny or twopence, and range upwards to five shillings ; striking the average at sixpence, we should have 5000/. daily, or 1,500,000/. per annum. An ordinary bath will accom modate two hundred persons daily. At Constantinople, * The trough full of hot water called a bath, used to cost in London at least one shilling and sixpence, so that persons with less than 2001 a year could not afford to use them. In Paris, with fuel and water so much dearer, baths can be had as low as one-third. The recent washing-houses are something, but only as a commencement, and an earnest. Such contrivances will not change a people's taste. t Everything is dearer in England than in Turkey, except those things which are wanting for the bath : fuel is at a third of the cost, water is infinitely more abundant, and we have the same advantages over every other capital of Europe.

The cost of erection would be provided, as for hospitals, churches, &c, by foundation, donations, bequests, subscriptions, or municipal charges. The poor of England have never had an opportunity of knowing the comfort which is derived on a cold day from the warmth imparted by such an atmo sphere. How many of the wretched inhabitants of London go to their chilly homes in the winter months benumbed with cold, and with no means of recovering their animal warmth but by resorting to spirits and a public-house fire. The same sixpence which will only procure them a quartern of the stimulant, which imparts but a momentary heat, would, if so expended, obtain for them at once warmth and refreshment. Do not run away with the idea that it is Islamism that prevents the use of spirituous liquors ; it is the bath. It satisfies the cravings which lead to those indulgencies, it fills the period of necessary relaxation, and it produces, with cleanliness, habits of self-respect, which are incompatible with intoxication: it keeps the families united, which prevents the squandering of money for such excesses.

They insisted on my returning straight by the sea-road to Rabat. The ingenuity and perseverance they displayed was of the highest order, considering that every step they took was a failure. Their object was to get back as soon as they could ; but, as they dared neither leave nor constrain me, I successfully opposed the vis inerti\u00e6 to all their devices. At last they gave in, declaring they were ready to accompany me when, where, and how I liked ; but, just as we were setting forth, and were all assembled on horseback near the only gate, I discovered a fresh plot to frustrate a boar-hunt, which I had fixed for the following day. I slipped off my horse, and gliding round a corner, and otherways deceiving their vigilance or observation, I got away without being observed by any one, for the whole of the inhabitants were collected to see the start. There was but this one gate ; but in"], [578, "90 A SCENE AND my arch\u00e6ological researches I had discovered a part of the wall which was scalable : I made for it, got over, and dropped on the other side. After sitting on their horses' backs for better than an hour, and fatiguing their poor necks, they got alarmed, insti tuted a search, ransacked the town, and were at their wits' end, when a gardener entered the gate with his ass, bearing a load of mussels, which, he informed them \" the Nazarene \" had gathered on the rocks off the \" point.\" They now started in pursuit, accom panied by every person in the place who could muster a horse or mule. I was seated on the top of the promontory as they galloped up. I was prepared for a frantic scene, but the first glimpse, as their faces came in sight over the cheek of the hill, satisfied me that they had passed into a new phase. I had entered on the hereditary privileges of a saint or madman. I was adjured and entreated, and suffered myself to be lifted on the horse brought for me, and frt\u00bbm that hour experienced nothing but affability, and the readiest assent to whatever I proposed.

This was the gist of the matter \u2014 we were Helots, and I wondered if it was some Spartan mode of expressing contempt. It was the very Spartan word, and the Helots of Laconica and the Kabyles of Algeria are de rived from the distinction \u2014 of which I was now made aware \u2014 between the Ziaide el Gaba and the Ziaide Helots, and which I suppose would be more accurately rendered Ziaide el Gabal and Ziaide el Loto. Marmol speaks of them as a tribe ; he says, \" The whole country between Fez and Morocco is peopled with Beribas and Helots, who are a mixture of Africans and Arabs, besides other powerful Arab tribes who possess the country, and pasture their flocks between Fez and the sea. The two most powerful races of Mauritania and Tangitana, are the Ibue Maliks Sophean, and the Helots. They furnish 11,000 horse to the Sultan.\" In our boar-hunting expeditions, we constantly stopped to gather blackberries from a tree between the olive and the myrtle, which, afterwards, when I had the opportunity of consulting authorities, I found to be the very Lotus.* 'O de Kapiros tjXkos Kvap.os ireiratveT at 8e wairep oi iSorpves, peraiSaX \\ttiv Tas xpotds. <t>i't\u00a3rai de Ka6direp Ta pvpra ivapdXKrjka, tvvkvos eVi tusi fSkturr&v, eadidpevos Se ev tois Aa>TO(j>dyots KaXovpevots ykvKvs, 17 Siis, Kal d<rivr)s.\u2014 TiiEOPiiu. 1. iv. c. 4."], [582, "94 THE LOTUS. Add to Loto the Arabic article, and you have at once Heloto, Helot. Unless I had been particu lar in my inquiries, I should have imagined that Heloto was the name of a people. A descriptive term derived from the tree may have therefore been applied in Greece, and mistaken by travellers in Sparta, or commentators at Athens, just as this has been mistaken by Marmol and Bochart. The turpentine-tree had also the same name, eloth, and it is curious that the same learned critic has derived the names of the two Jewish roots, from exactly the same distinction as that which prevails between the two branches of the Ziaide. Eloth from the tree, Ezion Gaber from the rocky nature of the country.* He traces the etymology by a different process, which I will not follow. I content myself with the coincidence of results. There was a plant of the name as well as a tree. The Egyptian Lotus was a stock that came up by the water with a head like a poppy, containing grains like millet. They were allowed to ferment, and then dried and pounded. It was the lightest and pleasantest of bread when eaten warm ; but, like Indian corn, became heavy and indigestible when cold. Those who lived on it suffered from no diseases of the stomach. It was therefore considered a cure for all these. The tree was the object of religious veneration, * \" Nomen Elath etiam Eloth est a terebinthis, qu\u00e6 arbor est frequens, &c.\" \u2014 Chanaan, lib. i. c. 43. \" A vicinia talis alicujus payj.ag dicta est Azion Gaber.\u2014 Ibid."], [583, "ORIGIN OF THE WORD \"HELOT.\" 95 and was brought to Italy at a very early age.\"\" It was planted in the temenas of temples.

One at the temple of Diana Lucina, was four hundred and fifty years old in the time of Augustus : it was called Capellata, because the Vestal Virgins brought them and concentrated their hair. Another, equally remark able for its enormous roots, stood by the temple of Vulcan. The word lotophagoi was derived from the tree, not the plant, for Pliny applies to the tree what Homer has said of the lotus and its fruit.

Such a connexion might in some degree account for that very extraordinary event, the colonization of Cyrena by Spartans, which is the reverse of the cur rent of ancient colonies. It furnishes also a key to the idea of the people of Jud\u00e6a, of their relationship with the- Spartans. When the Jews sent ambassadors to Rome, they directed them to go and salute their brethren at Sparta. Commentators and etymologists have endeavoured to explain the fact away, but the shout of the child in this sheepfold, while pointing, \"There Helots ;\"f and \" Here El Gaba ! \" seems to me to throw light upon portions of Greek history, which Thucydides has not elucidated, and which Potter and Fuller have not explained, and on passages of the Maccabees and Josephus, which Michaelis has amended and explained into nonsense and confusion. * By submitting to Spartan discipline, Helots became Spartans. \u2014 Zeles apud Stob.

As to the name Helot, we are left equally in the dark. That it was not their own name for themselves is shown by the etymology suggested, and no one would accept it, but because he can find no other. The deri vation from the town Helos is ungrammatical, and would only shift the difficulty of admitting its deri vation from the participle of the verb \" to capture ;\" the word, however, occurs in another shape. There was a festival called Heloteia \u2014 the Helotean \u2014 the fes tival of the Loto. It was held in Crete (a Ph\u0153nician settlement) . It was to commemorate the rape of the Ph\u0153nician Europa. Here is a new puzzle. Again is introduced the easy expedient of the participle ; then it is supposed that the Ph\u0153nicians called a virgin Helotes. Bochart exposes the absurdity of these suggestions, and remarks that Europa was no longer a virgin when she came to Crete. He derives it from Halloth, Hebrew for epithalamium, forgetting his own objection of the minute before, and more over that her marriage could not well be celebrated after her death ; besides, there was another festival called Heloteia at Corinth, where there was no ques tion of \" virgin,\" or of \" capture,\" or of \" marriage.\" It was held to commemorate the staying of a plague. Having then swept away all these suppositions, let us see what the Heloteia was. It was a festival in honour of Europa. The boves were carried in pro cession, and surrounded by an enormous wreath or garland, thirty feet in circumference. This garland had a name : it was Hellotis, 'E}.Kwrig. VOL.

It is said, indeed, that the Hellotis was a garland of myrrh. The Loto is very like myrrh. The Greeks adopted the myrrh itself from the Easterns. It was appropriated to funeral ceremonies. It is mentioned by Nehemiah as one of the four trees used in the festival of the tabernacles, and classed with the palm, the olive, and the fir. In the traditions of Arabia, Adam fell from Paradise with three things \u2014 \" A branch of myrrh, a date, and an ear of corn.\" The word is found, little altered, scattered all over Greece. There is the district of Elatea in Epirus, Elatea city of Phocis, Helos in Laconia, Helos again in Macedonia, Lait\u00e6 on the Sperchius, and Hellopia is so often repeated, that it must have been a generic term. It applies to one third of the island of Eub\u0153a. It is also a town there. It is found again to the south-east of the Pindus, and it is the name given to the district of Dordona. But it does not stand alone. The multitude of Ph\u0153nician and Hebrew names could never have been found there, unless it had been inhabited some time by tribes speaking the one or the other language ; as for instance, the Laleges, the Bryges, and the Helots.

They produce corn, wool, butter, hides and skins ; they buy nothing except arms and fruit ; they treat their money as they do their corn. This year a fine imposed in consequence of the recent troubles was paid without difficulty, though equal to several years of their customary taxes. The Zahel is one half the year exposed to scorch ing heat ; it is destitute of trees and water, and could scarcely be cultivated by people having fixed habi tations. The Arabs shifting their domicile to find pasturage for their cattle sow as they proceed, and return in like manner to reap. They sow from Novem ber to March. The harvest soon follows. The summer is, so to say, their winter, for the sun is their Boreas. The seasons are reversed. The flowers that were budding only on the plains, I found in full blossom on the hills : under the genial influence of cold, vege tation had re-commenced.

The tribe does not cultivate in common, but the families do : the daughters have half portions : they average a plough per tent, some having four or five, or more, others not even a pair of cattle, but managing one with another, so that each shall culti vate a plough land. Oxen are generally employed, but horses are so also : you may see pairs of horses driven by the reins. Some of their teams are gro tesque enough. I have seen a camel and an ass ploughing together.

However, we did fuse a portion of the ore, and thus saved our credit. After expeditions in search of fire-clay, and various renewed attempts, I had to dissuade them from proceeding thus reck lessly ; and told them that they might find as rich mines more conveniently situated, or mines of some other metal better worth working ; or iron, if not so pure, more malleable (for on this their present instruments could make no impression), or, in fact, coal and iron in juxta-position. They answered, dexterity, and dissimulation : however, it failed in one point.

I thought this a favourable moment to press my request to be permitted to go to Fez : I was told that if the Sultan were there, there would be no difficulty, but at present it was impossible. I have therefore determined on returning to Gibraltar, and visiting, if possible, the mountainous district lying to the eastward of Larache, called Serser, where sulphur, lead, and salt are already known, and there are indications of coal.

I was more at home at a ragout de Sang lier, of which an enormous cauldron figured among the operations of that court-yard, to the high applause of all the Nazarene population that chanced to be at Rabat. It was not, however, very easy to get at it when cooked ; for to all the plates, knives, and forks, saucers, and tea-cups, &c, it was taboo. While these operations were proceeding in the court-yard, the other parts of the consulate were equally put in requisition for the purposes of science.

Equally does it become a poison which absorbs all others. It will explain the incantations of Circe, and the mysteries of the cave of Trophonius.

The preparation requisite for such deeds was not opium or alcohol, far less a plant, the effect of which exceeds intoxication, and approaches insanity. The Ismalian departed on his journey of death alone. He followed his victim for months and years ; he traversed deserts and sojourned in populous king doms and cities. It was an intoxication of the spirit, not of the senses, that could so dare and so endure ; neither softened by intercourse, nor dismayed by solitude, and proof alike against the virtues and the vices of our nature. If such deeds were the product of this drug, they would appear when it was used. Hassan Saba was one of those men, who being incomprehensible, is the source of fables, devised by those who do not understand the results they would account for.

The Isma lians, acting as men out of their senses, would be called hashasheen, just as we would say Bedlamite. If any set of men in Barbary were so conducting themselves, they would be called hashishlee, though they had never tasted majoun. I was led to take an interest in this plant from the following circumstance. A lady, suffering from spasms, arising from an affection of the spine, had obtained some years ago a small portion of hashish (at the time a name unknown), when all other narcotics had failed : it afforded her an almost miraculous relief. Medical men had been applied to in India to procure the bangue, but it failed. The hemp of Eng land had been tried in vain. I wrote to Mr. Lane, then in Egypt, requesting him to obtain some, but he found it a disgraceful thing to make inquiries on the subject. All these endeavours ended in disap pointment. Still I remained satisfied that there was such a plant. At Tangier I observed a diminutive pipe, about the size of a thimble ; I asked what kind of tobacco they were smoking. I was answered, kef (literally, enjoyment), \u2014 it was the hashish. I found that it was also taken inwardly. Either the leaves are swallowed with water, after being crushed, or it is prepared, and boiled with sugar or honey, and butter, like horebound, a great variety of seeds and spices entering into the composition, which is thus said to vary in its effects, and to be gifted also with medicinal powers. This preparation is the majoun. Its effects"], [616, "128 REPORTED EFFECTS were described as those of the laughing gas, except that, instead of a few minutes, it lasts for many hours. Some cry, some laugh, some fall into drowsy listless ness ; some are rendered talkative and funny. They see visions, imagine themselves reduced to poverty, or become emperors and commanders of armies, the natural disposition predominating in the derangement. Men under its influence were pointed out to me in the streets. They walked along with fixed eye, heed less of all around them. Some take it daily in small quantities, producing, as one of them described it to me, \" a comfortable state of mind,\" without appear ing to impair the general health. Under its influence the mouth is parched ; it is not in their power to spit. Their eyes become red and small. They are ravenous for food. Everything that one hears of it has the air of fable ; and I should have been inclined to treat it as such, but for the evidence of my own senses. Finding that I could not understand from descrip tion either the mode of preparing it, or the effects, I determined to get those who were accustomed to make it to bring the materials, and prepare it before me, and then to try it myself, and on as many others as I could. I was so engaged for a week after my return to Rabat, for I had successively the three most noted confectioners to try their skill against each other. They have not a regular or uniform process, and the majoun is consequently of very unequal strength and efficacy. Our first attempts were failures."], [617, "129 OF HASHISH. The first proof of the success of our preparation was in the case of a young English clergyman, to whom some of it had been given as a sweetmeat. Some hours passed without any visible effects, when a musician, who had the faculty of strangely distorting his features, came in, dressed as a mummer. The Englishman took him for the devil, and a most laugh able scene ensued. Next morning, on inquiries after his health, he said he had slept soundly and agree ably, \" as the windows and doors were bolted.\" Later in the day the effect disappeared entirely, and he seemed to recollect the circumstances with a confused pleasure, describing various things that had never happened. The first time I took it was about seven in the morning, and in an hour and a half afterwards I per ceived a heaviness of the head, wandering of the mind, and an apprehension that I. was going to faint. I thence passed into a state of half trance, from which I awoke suddenly, and much refreshed. The im pression was that of wandering out of myself. I had two beings, and there were two distinct, yet concur rent trains of ideas. Images came floating before me \u2014 not the figures of a dream, but those that seem to play before the eye when it is closed, and with those figures were strangely mixed the sounds of a guitar that was being played in the adjoining room : the sounds seemed to cluster in and pass away with the figures on the retina. The music of the wretched performance was heavenly, VOL. II. R"], [618, "130 EFFECT OF HASHISH and seemed to proceed from a full orchestra, and to be reverberated through long halls of mountains. These figures and sounds were again connected with metaphysical reflections, which also, like the sounds, clustered themselves into trains of thought, which seemed to take form before my eyes, and weave them selves with the colours and sounds. I was foUowing a train of reasoning ; new points would occur, and concurrently there was a figure before me throwing out corresponding shoots like a zinc tree ; and then, as the moving figures reappeared, or as the sounds caught my ear, the other classes of figures came out distinctly, and danced through each other. The reasonings were long and elaborate ; and though the impression of having gone through them remains, every effort has been in vain to recall them. The following scene was described by me, and taken down at the time : \u2014 A general, commanding an army, and doubting whether he should engage the enemy, consulted the oracle. The oracle answered, \"Go with the fortune of C\u00e6sar.\" He gave battle, and was beaten ; his king ordered his head to be cut off, but the general accused the oracle : the king said, \" The oracle is not in fault ; it did. not tell you that you were C\u00e6sar ; you were twice a fool to mistake its meaning, and your own worth.\" The general answered, \" Then is the fault his who sent a fool to command his armies.\" \" Nay,\" answered the king, \" thou shalt not twist one phrase to thy benefit, and another to my loss.\" This"], [619, "ON THE AUTHOR. 131 scene seemed to pass before me, and in the region of Carthage, which was all familiar, though I had never been there. The general was an Abyssinian, the king a white man with a black beard. The next time I tried it, the only effect was to make me lose a night's rest ; the first time, it had given me a double portion of sleep : on both occasions it enormously increased my appetite. It was fol lowed by no depression. The third time I took it, at half-past four, and after it, a liqueur glass of cara way spirits to hasten the effect. An hour afterwards, walking on the terrace, I began to experience the effects. I did not feel cold, while those who were walking with me, and wrapt in mantles were com plaining of it. They profess to be able to pre pare it, so that it shall serve a man instead of clothing. Then came an unsteadiness of gait \u2014 not that of one who fears to fall \u2014 but of one who tries to keep down, for I felt as if there were springs in my knees, and was reminded of the story of the man with the mechanical leg, that walked away with him. I sat down to dinner at half past six o'clock. There was a glass between me and the rest of the company, and an inch or two interposed between me and what ever I touched. What I ate, or how much, did not matter;\u2014 the food flowed like a river through me. There was a wind going by, blowing over the table, and carrying away the sounds, and I saw the words tumbling over one another down the falls. There is a dryness of the mouth, which is not thirst. The dryness k2"], [620, "132 EFFECT OF HASHISH radiated from the back of the throat, opposite the nape of the neck. It was a patch of dark blue colour; the food, as it reached this point, pouring down, and taking the colour of the patch. I was under the im pression that I described all this at the time, but was told that I would not say anything about myself, or describe what I experienced. I should have been relieved if some one present had been under the same influence. The bursts of laughter to which I gave rise were not at all pleasing, except when they were excited by any observation I made which was not connected with myself. I never lost the consciousness of what was going on ; there were always present the real objects, as well as the imaginative ones ; but at times I began to doubt which was which, and then I floated in strange uncertainty. It came by fits at \u2014 as I thought \u2014 hours of interval, when only minutes could have elapsed. Sometimes a week seemed to pass between the beginning and the end of a word. I fancied my head an inverted pendulum, which it cost me a great deal of labour to keep straight, when I could resist no longer, and let it go, and it went back as if a blow had been discharged. I struggled against each relapse, out of a sense of politeness towards the company, of which I did not fail to inform them, notwithstanding their roars of laughter. The back of my neck was the pivot ; there was a heavy upper weight on the top of my head, and the pendulum was swinging between my legs ; but the pendulum was attracted upwards to the table, and I"], [621, "ON THE AUTHOR. 133 had to struggle to keep it down by keeping my head up. The swinging fit was accompanied by bursts of laughter. I derived great pleasure from allowing my head to go back; but the laughter was unlike any mortal merriment ; it seemed as never to end, and to press me, and to lead up to a mountain-top. When any one put his hand behind my head, fearing the effect of the jerks, or that I should throw the chair over, I was very much annoyed, because it disturbed, as I said, \" the isochronism of the oscillations.\" I afterwards saw a similar effect produced on a European who did not know what he had taken. He was constantly throwing back his head and looking at the ceiling, and exhibited no other symptom, which only made this the more ludicrous. After keeping the party for four hours in a state of continual convulsion, I became irresistibly drowsy, and was moved away to bed. This operation sickened me, and brought on a slight vomiting. The instant I was in bed I fell asleep, and slept without intermission for nine hours ; I then awoke, perfectly recovered, and fresh, with a feeling of lightness, and in high spirits. One of the most remarkable effects was, that it seemed to lay bare your inmost thoughts, and to present a mirror, on which was reflected every act of your life, and that you were constrained to reveal and confess it all; which exactly agrees with effects attri buted to the ophisnu.

A party of them will agree to take it together, and go out to a garden. One of them, being asked to describe a scene of that kind, said, \" We were eight, and seven took to laughing, and one to crying, and the more he cried the more we laughed, and the more we laughed the more he cried, and so we spent the night, and in the morning we went to bed.\" After being satisfied with my preparation, I de voted a day to the trying of the experiment on a number of patients. Two or three took it in the morning, and each as he had taken it became ex ceedingly anxious to administer it to others, so that patients were sought in every place and by every means. Many who took it went away, so that I did not see the effect on more than a dozen. On the whole I was disappointed : there was not one interest ing case, though there were not two alike. The master of a Portuguese vessel, to whom it was given without his being aware of its nature, thought himself bewitched, and his crew were on the point of securing him as deranged. He saw a ship stranded on the bar, and ordered out his boats to her assist ance ; he then saw the devil cooking in the caboose, and with the demeanour of an insane person, was all the while reasoning on the evidences of his insanity. Having at one time been in the habit of taking opium, I am able to compare the effects. The idea of a strong resemblance has been generally admitted ;"], [623, "135 HASHISH AND OPIUM COMPARED. but in this I cannot agree. In De Quincy's \"Confessions of an Opium-Eater,\" there are passages which might pass for a description of hashish, but they do not appear to me to be descriptive of opium : opium does not give the double identity, and the hashish draws towards insanity : the hashish does not affect either the nervous system or the viscera. The length of time that elapses before it begins to act, shows that it has first to be taken into the blood. I have witnessed its effects in relieving pains and spasms, which differ from those of ordinary narcotics.* It is an anodyne and an anti-spasmodic, producing intoxication without its consequences, and dispeUing its effects. The French have become intoxicated with hash ish. A number of works and essays have been published on the subject in Paris. Multitudes of experiments have been made, and endless visions seen or described. From these I select one specimen, which to him who has eaten hashish bears intrinsic evidence, pour le fond, of being genuine. \" It appeared * In an interesting article in Chambers's Magazine of No vember 1848, the writer says : \u2014 \" It is the nervous system that is affected, no other part of the body being acted upon ; hashish thus materially differing from opium, whose power is marked upon the muscular and digestive systems, retarding the action of the organs, and leaving them in a complete state of inaction.

Around him were sparklings of precious stones of all colours, changes eternally produced, like the play of the ka leidoscope. He every now and then saw his friends who were around him disfigured \u2014 half men, half plants ; some with the wings of the ostrich, which they were constantly shaking. So strange were these, that he burst into fits of laughter ; and to join in the apparent ridiculousness of the affair, he began throwing the cushions in the air, catching and turn ing them with the rapidity of an Indian juggler. One gentleman spoke to him in Italian, which the hashish transposed into Spanish. After a few minutes he recovered his habitual calmness, without any bad effect, without headache, and only astonished at what had passed.

He swam in an ocean of sound, where floated, like isles of light, some of the airs of ' Lucia di Lam mermuir,' and the ' Barber of Seville.' Never did similar bliss overwhelm him with its waves : he was lost in a wilderness of sweets ; he was not himself ; he was relieved from consciousness \u2014 that feeling which always pervades the mind ; and for the first time he comprehended what might be the state of exist ence of elementary beings, of angels, of souls sepa rated from the body : all his system seemed infected with the fantastic colouring in which he was plunged. Sounds, perfume, light, reached him only by minute rays, in the midst of which he heard magnetic cur rents whistling along.

They give it also to horses, as it was told me first, to make them fiery ; but on further inquiry, I found that it was given to them as a purge, and that afterwards they leave them in repose like men, as they are unable to keep their feet.

CHAPTER XII. THE HISTORY OF MUFFINS. \u2014 THE ORIGIN OF BUTTER. \u2014 THE ENGLISH BREAKFAST. The day we landed at Rabat we heard a little tinkling bell through the street, just like the four o'clock muffin-bell in London. One of the party asked if it were tea-time amongst the Moors, and the others laughed, thinking it a good joke : \u2014 there was no joke in the case. These cockney cakes are just as common here as within the sound of Bow bells, and served for breakfast in Barbary when Queen Elizabeth's maids of honour had for theirs beefsteaks and ale, or herrings and bread and cheese. They are a little larger than those in London, and exactly the peiklets of the midland counties. To find muffins and crumpets here is, indeed, in the language of modern philosophy, a \"great and a twofold fact.\"* It is, however, one which great men have overlooked ; because, although a cook must be a philosopher, it is not required that a philosopher should be a cook. The incident set me upon considering the nature * See \" History of Civilization,\" passim."], [629, "ORIGIN OF MUFFINS. 141 of the muffin, and opened to me a large field of speculation, culinary and historical. I first perceived that there were combined in the greasy accompani ment of our tea-tables characters so diverse, that it must have a history, and an eventful one ; that it must have undergone vicissitude and persecution in the course of its wide career, the range of which in space and time could not be doubtful, from the place in which I found it. Let me dispose first of the word crumpet: it is clearly a recent one. Peiklet is still used in the interior of England, and one name is given to both by Moors and Jews, sfen ; I shall, therefore, equally employ for both the word \" muffin.\"* The muffin is bread, cake, and dish:\\ like the first, it is fermented ; like the second, baked or toasted on a griddle ; like the third, it requires to be cooked before it is eaten. Our method of cooking, by toasting first and then softening by butter, appears at the first glance the travestie of some lost method. The use of the toasting-fork could not have preceded coal fires and grates with upright bars, an invention not earlier than the Georges ; nor could it have preceded the use of butter, which cannot be traced beyond the Dutch stadtholder. In America, they do not * The Americans call crumpets muffins, so that the latter must have been the common name at the time of the early emigration westward. \u2022j- In the culinary language of our country, I use this term to supply the place of \" plat,\" and \" met.\""], [630, "142 MOORISH AND JEWISH MUFFINS. toast and butter muffins, but eat them hot, as baked. They were, therefore, originally a part of the regular cookery of the country, and, indeed, could not belong, as at present, to \"breakfast\" and \"tea,\" which meals are of recent invention. Morocco presents the ori ginal practice : here they are simmered in oil or butter, and then dipped in honey. I did not see them used in dressed dishes ; but Marmol, writing two centuries ago, describes them as employed in this manner. He says, \" In Morocco, there are two ways of making bread \u2014 baking in an oven, as we do in Europe, and preparing it in pans to be eaten hot with honey and butter, or with oil. These cakes are sometimes stewed with the flesh of goats, for that of sheep is difficult to be got at, and that of cattle they do not consider wholesome.\"* The Moors and the Jews cook them differently, the former using butter, the latter oil : they thus connect baking and cooking, and illustrate differences between Judaism and Islam, or, perhaps, between Jew and Gentile. With these data it may be worth while to endeavour to find traces of them in ancient times.

Among the Greek states, Athens was most distinguished for its bread ; yet there were there foreign bakers \u2014 and these Lydians.* There was bread known by the name of Cappadocian, and the Ph\u0153nicians were held bakers of first repute. This people was said to possess as many kinds of bread as there were days in the year : their merit, however, does not seem to have consisted in baking, properly so called, but in com bining preparations of flour with other viands ; and in the Old Testament we have constant references to the mixtures of flour with oil and honey, all which approach to the Moorish sfen. The names of only three out of the three hundred and sixty-five kinds of Ph\u0153nician bread have been handed down : the three resemble one another. This must have been the kind of bread for which Ph\u0153 nicia was celebrated, and the descriptions apply to the muffin and the sfen, still preserved in countries which they colonized. The three kinds are lackmar, chebrodlapson, and maphula: lackmar is evidently derived from lackma, to swallow (whence lick), and must have been remarkably soft. Athen\u00e6us calls it \" digrov axoikov.\" It was prepared with milk and oil : the Syrians were celebrated for making it.

Bochart, with his usual sagacity, has detected the union of cooking and baking, and also that the Jews and Arabs cooked the muffin differently.

The secret of French pastry consists in bringing the butter and the dough to exactly the same con sistency : this is effected by temperature for the butter, by water for the dough, cooling down the one or softening the other. When so adjusted, the butter in one mass is covered in;* it then spreads under the rolling-pin equally as the dough spreads, each in its own plane. Folded over and over again, the two keep distinct, and thus are obtained the flakes.

This is Neideh A Ibousch ; but when no flour is added, and it is boiled until it coagulates, it is better and sells for a higher price, and is called Neideh Makoudeh. * Soyonti speaks of it as one of the things in high estimation in Egypt, and quotes an old writer, who says that it was discovered by the Virgin Mary. Be ing without milk, she was inspired with the idea of preparing it for the Infant Jesus. P. Sicard saw this dish at Meuschieh, and thus describes it : \" The * Khalil Dhaheri mentions it also.

A sweet and agreeable confection is then made with out sugar, and the people of the country esteem it much, and are very fond of it.\" * In the time of Sonnini it had disappeared from Meuschieh. Here we have the steeping of the grain, the grinding, and the diluting of it in water, as in the present Eastern pastry. Although we have not the toasting of it on the griddle, more cannot be wanted to carry this pro cess back to ancient times, and to those celebrated baker-cooks of Tyre and Sidon. The neideh is still preserved in Britain under the name of Frumenty or Furmity. The method of pre paring it is now in the hands of a few persons only, and has become a secret ; and, probably, in another generation it too will have died out, under the crush ing roller of subdivision of labour. Where still used, it is only on one occasion in the year, Mid Lent Sunday. When brought to market it is of the consistence of thick gum. Those who have eaten it describe it as an excellent dish.

We read of butter in ancient times, but it was gee. The merit of ours is its being made from cream thrown up cold. The milk of kine alone has that property ; and that milk during many cen turies was unknown to man as food. The great event of primeval society was the em ployment of cattle in tillage. To preserve and in crease the breed was the first care of legislators : this they effected by consecrating the cow,* and its purposes. It consists in boiling it slowly after it is made : the process takes six hours, two to heat it, two to cool it, and two to simmer it. There is a white, hard cheesy sediment which has carefully to be removed. He also describes a process, by which the whole of the butter of these Alpine pastures is preserved sweet, without salt. \" On a board, four or five inches wide, wooden pins two to three feet in length, are fixed upright ; the butter is placed daily around these pins, beginning at the lower end, in a mass not exceeding the width of the board. Every day, as more butter is added around the pin, the diameter is gradually enlarged, until the upper part overhangs the base, like an in verted bee-hive.

The fire must be very low, half embers (wood), half ashes ; the cup of coffee small ; and a small pot so as to make it cup by cup. The coffee must be slowly roasted, not burnt, and brought only to an umber brown ; it must be roasted day by day. The flavour dissipates in a few hours ; it must be reduced by pounding to an impalpable powder. These are the conditions under which coffee can be made. In making it, two opposite and apparently incompatible ends are to be secured, \u2014 strength and flavour ; to obtain the first it must be boiled, \u2014 by boiling, the second is lost. The difficulty is surmounted by a double process ; one thorough cooking, one slight one ; by the first a strong infusion is obtained, by the second that infusion is flavoured. Thus, a large pot with coffee-lees stands simmering by the fire ; this is the sherbet : when a cup is wanted, the pounded coffee is put in the little tin or copper pan and placed on the embers ; it fumes for a moment ; then the sherbet is poured on ; in a few seconds the froth (caimah) rises ; presently an indication that it is about to boil is made manifest, when the coffee is instantly taken from the fire, and carried to the apart ment, and turned into the cup and drunk. f There is one thing new under the sun, and that is an egg cup : no egg cups are to be found in Etruscan sepulchres, in"], [645, "157 MODE OF MAKING BUTTER IN MOROCCO. of a meal.

The skin is slung between them, a leg stretched out to each reed. A woman, seated on the ground, pushes and swings it, and presently the butter is churned.

The Jews interpret the injunction \" Thou shalt not seethe the kid in the mother's milk,\" to mean, that butter be not mixed with meat ;* consequently they do not allow it to touch any pan, dish, platter, knife, spoon, or dresser used for their ordinary food. \" An tagonism\" being thus established between butter and their common diet, butter does not make \" pro gression,\" nor even hold its own. It is to be inferred, that the butter they knew contained, \u2014 in part at least, \u2014 the milk of goats, as would be the case in the Zahara method of churning. It is first mentioned when Abraham entertains the angels. He took \"butter and milk, and the calf he had dressed.\" f Four centuries later, we have \" Rivers * There is a work by Maimonides upon this subject. The title, as translated, is \" Carnis cum lacte non commedenda.\" t Genesis xviii. 8."], [654, "166 OCCASIONS ON WHICH BUTTER of honey and butter;\"* and butter compared with oil for \" washing one's steps.\" f It then occurs in Moses's song : \" Butter of kine, milk of sheep, and fat of lambs.\" It next appears in Deborah's and Barak's song : \" He asked for water, and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.\" \\ It is brought for David when he is fleeing from Absalom. \u00a7 The wise man speaks of it as a wise man ought : \" The churning of milk bringeth forth butter.\" || The last mention is the most remarkable ; it is Isaiah's pro- phecy respecting Christ : \" Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse evil and choose good.\" The word translated butter is imae,% which Calmet explains as \" the scalded cream in use in the East.\" Gesenius says, \" Butter by the ancients, as well as by the orientals, was only used medically.\" By others it is interpreted \" curdled milk,\" \" cheese,\" &c. In a word, the commentators have been as much put out by Jewish butter as the scholiast by Ph\u0153nician bread. Had curds or sour milk been meant, the proper name would have been given. Had Calmet known any- thing of the scalded cream \" in use in the East,\" he never could have supposed that it would be employed to wash with. None of these could be obtained by churning. Then it is answered, that the Jews had no churn. There is no such word in Hebrew : the passage of Solomon is, \" As the churning of milk * Job xx. 17. X Judges v. 25. t Job xxix. 6. \u00a7 2 Samuel xvii. 29. n \u2022\"\u25a0wan. || Proverbs xxx. 33."], [655, "IS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE. 167 bringeth forth butter, so doth the wringing of the nose bring forth blood, and the stirring up of wrath bring forth strife.\" The same word is employed throughout \u2014 mitz. But the word which could be translated \" churning,\" \" wringing,\" and \" stirring up,\" seems most happily adapted to describe the' jerk and swing of the skin full of liquid on the camel's back, or the process by which it was imitated. In none of these passages, save the last, is butter spoken of as in use among Jews after the promulgation of the Ceremonial Law. Abraham and Job are ante- rior, so is the period to which Moses refers when he speaks of the good things which they had abused, and thereby incurred God's displeasure. When brought forth in a \" lordly dish,\" it was by a Midianite offered to a Hazorite.* There was much conveyed to the Israelite in the epithet given to a dish in which butter could never be placed by him. When brought to David it is offered indeed to a Hebrew under the Ceremonial Law, but it might be for the Pelethites or Cerethian, who accompanied him ; it is presented too by \" one of the children of Ammon.\" Solomon might be describing the practice of the neighbouring Arabs or Canaanites. In both the cases in which it is mentioned by Isaiah (ch. vii.), viz., that Christ shall * There is an Arab counterpart to the story of Sisera, and a fact.

The Old Testament thus entirely establishes the present usage of Morocco, and its identity with Pales tine. There, as here, butter was made, and then, as now, the Philistine fried his muffins in butter, the Jew in oil. One of the forms in which milk is most generally used, and of all, perhaps, the most healthful and agreeable, is unknown in Europe, and has no name amongst us : it is a curd (yumed) without rennet. It is used fresh, but may be drained of its whey and kept a considerable time. In travelling, it is hung in a bag, and, when very dry, rubbed down with fresh milk or water. This is the leben* of the Arabs and the yourt\\ of the Turks : it is also made in India, and called tyre. It is made as follows : \u2014 the milk is heated to the point of boiling, and then allowed to cool down until the finger can be kept in it while you count three : a spoonful of the old yourt, mixed first with a little of the milk, is then poured in. It is put in a warm place (the temperature must not be under 70\u00b0), and in two or three hours it will have set. The process is one of fermentation : the * Leben also signifies butter-milk, &c.

The first leaven of yourt, they say, was brought by Gabriel to Abraham. They, however, profess to be able to make it anew by re peating the above process during a fortnight, using on the first occasion a crab pounded in vinegar, or a silver spoon or button : I have succeeded in ob taining it without either the crab or the spoon. Milk after being brought to the boiling point, was allowed to sour ; a spoonful of it was mixed on the second day, that again on the third, and so on till the four teenth, when perfect yourt was obtained. When staying at Lamlin in Hungary, I used to have yourt sent over from Belgrade : the Germans were very glad to get it, but had no idea of making it for themselves. So travellers from all countries of Europe have become acquainted with it, and learn its value as an economical food and its qualities as a healthy diet. Most of them like it, some of them give it the preference over everything else ; yet no one has thought of introducing it at home. In Greece, before and during the revolution, it was, like baths, common use. \" Civilization \" came, and a wholesome food and a healthful practice were straightway expelled. This species of curd, without the aid of the liquid found in the rennet of young animals, offers the ex planation of practices of the Greeks, and suggests the possibility of unknown uses even of milk.

It may then be churned into butter : the \" scalded cream of the East\" is made by a similar process. The milk is poured into small shallow earthenware basins, which are put in the oven with a slow heat : the lighter part rises, and crusts. Gradually it hardens and thickens, until, by gathering up the whole substance, it forms a little dome. It is then lifted off like a cake, and a little colourless fluid remains at the bot tom. This cream derives its name from the process of making it, caimac, which means burnt.* \" Cream \" has in Latin the same meaning : it could not, therefore, have been originally applied as at present, and the first cream the European nations who employed the word had seen must have been \" burnt ; \" \u2014 that is, caimac. It was probably invented during the Crusades. All the nations of Europe use this word. It follows, that none of them could ori ginally have had it ; for, in that case, they would have had an original one. Spain is, however, an exception : the Spaniards did not take part in the Crusades. Professor Ritter has made use of this art in tracing the ancient Scythians, and W. Von Humboldt has in like manner employed it in his remarkable work on the Basques.

The Spanish has original words for cream and but ter ; the first is nata?'' the second manteca. Man teca means also fat, so that it could not have been with them primitive : they do not use it now, save as an imported habit. In the Basque provinces it is indigenous, as among the trbeis of the Zahara, and for the dairy, in all its branches, they have original terms : milk is eznea, tion of butter (buttervercitung), which came from the bar barians to the Greeks, and has remained a distinguishing cha racter of the northern and German people.

These terms are wholly distinct from Aramean, Greek, Scythian, Ger man, or Celt. Between the north and south of the peninsula the difference in practice coincides with the difference of its terms ; and both prove that two distinct people anciently inhabited it. It was next to impossible that such primitive terms should have been lost. The things were unknown to the Romans, and the words introduced to supplant them were not Roman. (Nata is an adaptation of the Latin natare.) More is not wanted to confirm the statement of Strabo, that the \" Hispani restrict the term Iberia to the portion bounded by the river Iber.\" The two races were Hispani and Iberi. Connected with this subject is another peculiarity worth mentioning. The Greeks had two names for bread ; the one the vulgar name, which I have already traced to the Brebers, and which is preserved in the modern dialect of Greece and of Andalusia, in sp\u00a3_ui and acemite. The other is artos (ugrog). Now this word is pure Basque, and is found in a variety of compounds in their tongue. They have two words for bread, artoa and oguia: the first at present applied to maize, the second to barley ; but the first is the primitive, being derived from \" grinding with a stone ;\" * and as supplying the word for \" dough,\" * Humboldt derives this word from acorn. \" If the edible gland is formed in the north of Spain, and if this name (artea) is there given to the oak that bears it, then it may be supposed that the Basque artoa, comes from this and from the ancient habit of acorn bread, referred to by Juvenal (Sat. vi. 10), \" glan-"], [664, "SIMILARITY OF GREEK AND BASQUE WORDS. 176 artaoria (orea, mass).

Now it may be asked, could the Greeks derive so primitive a word as \" bread \" from the Basques 1 * The explanation is given by Socrates : \" The Greeks had many words from the barbarians who were before them;\" and the Basques were not always confined to the north of Spain. We know that they colonized Sicily, and traces of the language are to be found on the shores of the Euxine. The settlement of the Celts in Italy was coeval with Rome. If they had known cream and used butter, the Romans must have had them : their ornaments, their bedding, the square and lozenge patterns, their soap, &c, are known to us. The words and usages are thus not to be considered as belonging to their common race, but as derived from the incidents of their own adventures. In Gaelic, or more properly Frse,f the word for dem ructante marito,\" this is nearer than Aratu to plough, or the Greek dproe. I cannot answer for the three suppositions, but when acorns are eaten, they are not made into bread. Juve nal speaks of acorns, not of bread.

It is fin : in the genitive case it is the same as the Hebrew, fine. They have a second word which approaches equally to the Semetic gee. It is ce. This appears to be the oiled butter which has now fallen into disuse.* Like the ancients they used it medicinally, and kept it till it was rancid This is the third kind of butter known ; and they have a third name, butter. This word they got where they got fin and ce. The medicinal use of butter has in these days been reduced to one spot of Africa \u2014 that is, Suz ; and thence a traffic in it is carried on to Negroland, just as formerly it must have been exported from the whole coast of Barbary to Europe. This preparation is known to-day in the interior of Africa \u2014 precisely in the region where neither European nor Roman, nor Greek, could have spread it \u2014 as Budra. The word is given, and the substance described, in Jackson's Vocabulary of the Shelloh dialect.

I need not here repeat what I have else where said regarding the transposition of cognate letters. D and T are such. In adding, according to the Greek and Roman fashion, their termina tion, they would for euphony say, Butyron for Budron. Cheese in Erse, is Caise, * pronounced Caishee. This, too, is supposed to come from the Romans, and the probability of this derivation is increased by Pliny's statement, that the barbarians had no cheese; but we know that the Greeks had their cheese from the Ph\u0153nicians, since the word rvgov is explained at least, as Tyrian. Phrygia exported even cheese of asses' milk.f The old Arabs had a cheese of goats' milk, not learnt from the Romans, for it had another name, Raib. It is clear, then, that the Semetic races did not know the use of cheese, though, perhaps, as at present, they were not partial to it, and did not excel in making it. In the interior of Africa they do make cheese, and in the dialect of the great in terior tribe extending from Morocco to the Red Sea, the name is agees.

They have a proper name for churn muidhe. t In Ireland they churn the whole milk. The striplings (the last milk from each cow, which is the richest) are put together in a deep crock, morning and evening till full. Any cream or whole milk which has remained over is added, it is not churned till it has become quite thick, this takes two or three days in summer, but in winter more, unless the tempera ture is kept up. The butter milk that remains, is far more nutritive than that from the churned cream, and is used for various domestic, culinary, nursery, and poultry- yard purposes. % \" One of the ladies of the dwelling brought a plate of fresh and exquisite honey, and a small plate of fresh butter, as part of our meal, and instructed us how they were to be eaten to gether.\" \u2014 Carne. s 2"], [668, "180 ANTIQUITY OF BUTTER AND CREAM back to the immediate progeny of Abraham.

Butter \u2014 that I mean in present use \u2014 being a preparation of cream, and cream being, as I have shown, of very recent invention, and not yet traced to its source ; the principal evidence of the originality of butter among the clans, must rest on the proof of their having been in possession of cream, and this, I think, I can establish most satisfactorily.

There yet remains one term unexamined. Whence comes dairy ? There is no such word on the Conti- nent ; it is neither Latin nor Teutonic. It has no Celtic root. I have been describing the douar, which is indeed a camp ; but tbe features which forced themselves upon my attention belonged to the sheep- fold. The people are shepherds. In every tent the chief utensils are the milk-pails, leathern churns, and butter-pots ; the chief produce and food, milk and butter. Why is the Arab camp a circle ? It is to fold the cattle. Thence the name, douar and dei'ra. The exploits of Abd-el-Kadir and his Deira have made the word familiar to us in Europe.

Ali Bey, in the narration of his pilgrimage, mentions that, after starting from some place, the whole caravan commenced a violent dispute about the loading of the animals ; after lasting about two hours, it sud denly ceased. On inquiring the cause of this phe nomenon, it was told him, that from such a place to such a place, \"the Arabs dispute.\" Our dispute had no limits, save those of the journey. A large party accompanied us across the water to the Salee side, and a slave of Mustafa Ducali's privately suggested that it was a great pity that I should go away, that it was better to stay at Rabat than to go. \" If you stay,\" said he, \"you will have a nice house like my master's, and two or three pretty wives, the daughters of caids.\""], [677, "189 ENVIRONS OF SALEE. We left the beach about two o'clock, turning to the right to avoid Salee : we passed through one of the gates of its old walls, enclosing the ancient harbour ; turning again to the left, we passed be tween the gardens and the back of the city. When opposite one of the gates, we sent in for corn to carry with us, and I was much tempted to enter the forbidden city, but contained myself, not to com mence dissensions with the guard at the very moment of starting. Rambling on while the guard awaited the mes senger, we came on a cleft in the rock, the bottom occupied by an orange grove, most inviting, with its green lustre and deep shadow, cool, damp, dark, and fragrant. To this retreat, many a seafarer has re turned to enjoy the fruits of his industry : how many a tender \" Rover,\" has been here formed by listening to his sire's tales of Maltese galleys, Christian argosies and Andalusian maids. While we were looking from the backs of our horses over the wall that ran along the edge of the cliff, the proprietor came up, and invited us to descend : there was nothing piratical about him, so we yielded. The first flight of steps brought us to a small tank, covered with a trellis of vines, surrounded by a little walk, through which there were grooves for the water to circulate, with out wetting your feet, and it fell from all sides into the tank in little cascades. At one side there was a little kiosk with a window opening upon the orange grove below. Here we found a party of"], [678, "190 HOSPITABLE BUT APPREHENSIVE HOST. Moors seated in one corner, and the inseparable tea- things in the other. My host hurried me down, and walked me all over the grounds, gathering sweet and bitter lemons and oranges, and seemingly anxious to stock me with a supply of every variety. Suddenly, having got me alone, he stopped, and with ominous signs and emphasis, pronounced the word Serser ! I was now in my turn anxious to know what he had to say, and wished to call a Jew I had got as an interpreter ; but this he would not suffer, and seemed to expect to succeed in making me understand by speaking very close to my ear : \u2014 he was much opposed to the working of mines, and apprehensive of my safety. When I admired in one place the culture of the garden, he said, \" this is the \" Madem \" (mines) of the Arabs ; \" he then asked me to stay some days at Tangier, and he would come and see me there. On taking leave, he insisted on walking with me a quarter of a mile, till I was outside of the aqueduct, and in the open country, and gave me the name of a person at Larache, to whose house he desired me to go. This person was absent on my arrival there. Towards sunset we entered a douar, without asking anybody's leave, and pitched in the middle of it without a question being asked us by any one : the change was as great as if one had fallen through from one century into another, yet all external objects were precisely the same. There were, however, only so many cottagers living in tents : we had entered a"], [679, "THE FORTRESS AT MEDEA. 191 village, not a douar. Had I gone from Tangier to Rabat by land, I should, by passing through these successive changes, have become gradually familiarized with them ; fortunately I had seen the southern coun try. Everything in this douar was for sale at ex tortionate prices, each bargain accompanied by great squabbling. The Sheik did come, and did bring, as a present, a jar of milk. This was all that recalled to me the tribes to the south. Early the next day we arrived at Medea. Lying on the edge of a ravine, we were almost at the gate before we saw it. Like the other towns, it is built at the estuary of a river, which descending through a chasm, has carved out through the rock and sand, its way to the ocean, where, met by a heavy surge, it heaps up a bar, which the waves incessantly lash. The fortress is a parallelogram. The contents in people, and in value, could not be equal to a douar. Below and between the town and the river, there is an enclosure of walls in the form of a rectangle, and about four hundred yards long : the walls are in Tapia, and vary from twenty to forty feet in height, and from five to seven in thickness. Seen from above, it appears like a labyrinth ; there are large square spaces and pas sages running round them ; the interval between the walls is at times not greater than their own thickness ; there are no windows or doors, or the spring of arches for covering in. Bare dead walls compose the vast chambers, or narrow passages ; a small aperture is seen here and there, by which a man might creep"], [680, "192 KNAVERY OF THE OUDAIAS. through. There is a Moorish gateway, but it is a modern addition. Being outside the fortress, and under it, this building could not have been intended in any way for defence. It was neither a reservoir for water, nor a store for merchandize. The deputy governor who accompanied me was perfectly certain that it was built by Christians : when I expressed doubts, he became angry, and vociferated loudly, \" Eusara,\" \" Romani.\" It was so fresh, that the walls might have been just finished or still in process of construction. I found the caid superintending the mending of an oar. He reiterated his salutations of welcome at least a dozen times (it has to be repeated three times) and pressed me to stay that night, or at all events to dine. We, however, were anxious to get on, and the cattle were conducted down to the boat, while the caid sent his deputy \u2014 who, like him self, every inch a Moor, is a negro in complexion, but whose features are European \u2014 to conduct me over the building I have already noticed. We intended here to get if possible fresh horses, not less on account of the wretched quality of those we had, than of the annoyance we suffered from their owners. After they had received their money, they wanted to decline performing the journey, and when I expressed surprise, they answered, \" We have no law \u2014 we have no flag : we are neither Mussulmans, Jews, nor Christians.\" This answer I comprehended, knowing them to be Oudaias, a tribe broken and"], [681, "MAJOON. 193 dispersed, and holding no ties with the world, its enemy \u2014 a Poland of the Desert. The boat in which we crossed was about forty feet by ten, pulled by a couple of oars. Their ingenuity had not arrived at making a platform for embarking cattle. The camels stride in fastly enough, and stow easily : they are made to crouch down head and tail, and a row of their strange heads projects over both sides. Getting in the horses is a laborious ope ration : they have to be unladen, and then walked into the water, and beaten until they spring in, first getting their fore-legs into the boat, and then with a second spring their hind-legs : some of them, how ever, are very expert. Our horses had to perform this operation four times between Rabat and Tangier \u2014 at Rabat, Medea, Larache, and Arzila. Just as we had got our cattle embarked, the caid was seen on horseback winding his way down the rock. We put back to take him in ; and he came into the stern, where we were seated upon our bag gage, carrying in his hand a handkerchief containing a large provision of hard-boiled eggs. He said, \" As you would not stay to eat, I had these boiled that you might not be hungry on the way.\" One of the packages of majoon appearing amongst the baggage, the conversation turned upon that composition ; and he told me that he was then going, in consequence of an order he had received that morning from the Sultan, to gather for him roots, from which an other and superior kind of majoon was made, and VOL.

As soon as we reached the indi cated place, he appeared on the hill above, coming towards us at full speed, and presented me with one of the roots, which was like a large parsnip : it ap pears to be the plant called surnag by Leo Africanus. He had also the consideration to bring some of the leaves, that I might recognise it again. I forgot to ask the mode of preparing it, which I have since been unable to ascertain, as it is not used by the people ; though the most strange stories are told of its effects. It is said to have been discovered by the Emperor Ismael, aud to its use is attributed the numerous progeny of that sovereign, reported at sixty births per month. The Seboo is the largest river of the kingdom of Fez ; it is here about half a mile in width : the bar is so fierce as to be wholly impassable. It rises in the Atlas, and passes near Fez and through Mequinez. A branch of it passes through the city of Fez : it is there termed the \" river of pearls,\" and was formerly called the \" river of gold.\" It was once navigable as far as Fez, and it still has all the appearance of being so ; yet the corn is carried thither to be ground at an expense of transport exceeding its value, and then the flour is carried back again, for at Fez they seem to have good mill-stones, and do not use the common sand-grit. But, probably, the navigation of the stream"], [683, "SAND OF THE SEBOO. 195 has been purposely disused, in pursuance of their standing policy of closing the door against Europeans, and sacrificing the advantages of the present to se curity for the future. The Seboo, more than any other river in Morocco, abounds with the shabel ; that of Azimore is the finest in quality. It is about the size of a salmon, which it resembles : the flesh is soft, fat, and delicate, and those who have tasted the kiran of the Lake of Ochrida have eaten something that recalls it. The Seboo bore signs of passing through a chalk country, showing that the region around had still all the aspect of the Zahel. The river, while we crossed it, was covered with bees that were dropping in. There are thousands of hives in the neighbourhood : the bees were perishing in great quantities from its being a foggy morning. A broad and level beach of sand bordered the river, and exhibited a beautiful pattern in colours, resembling that Moorish ornament which is at once the richest and the commonest. On pointing it out to one of those who were with me, he exclaimed, \" That is the figure on the Tower of Hassan.\" It is so remarkable that it must have been imitated in their buildings. It is produced by there being sands of different colours, which also vary in size and specific gravity. Each warp of a wave sets them in motion, and then deposits them with mathematical precision.

To the south there was no lime : the iron on the surface is red, being oxide : here the chalk commenced, and the iron is carbonate. Besides this, there are three or four sands of different shades of yellow and red, falling into different portions of the patterns. There is the blue,* brown, and yellow figure, as if laid on with a touch or stamped with a block. This beach presents at once the origin of the peculiar Moorish tracery and colouring, with which no other style has anything to compare. That night we encamped in a douar, which was near the southern extremity of the long marsh or lake, El Marga, which runs parallel to the sea. As we passed along its placid waters, we had on the left the incessant roar of the ocean, which we never saw. From the sea, the country must appear a perfectly barren waste ; and yet, at the back of the cliffs, there was a vale of forty miles thickly peopled and well cultivated. The lake seemed very shallow, and was so covered with waterfowl that they might have been rained upon it. We saw some boats, not pulled with oars, but punted. The lake varied in width from one mile to five. The douars were close to each other all along its banks on both sides ; but, on the side on which we were, the tents might be seen in lines, or irregularly scattered. They had seines and cast-nets, and the fish was chiefly a very fat but flavourless barbel. They did not shoot the * The iron sand gets a bluish tint from the yellow."], [685, "ALARM OF ROBBERS. 197 water-fowl, but caught them with gins of horse-hair, into which they ran their necks while swimming. The swans, in one place seen from a great distance, appeared like a white streak : we could scarcely be lieve they were birds till we came near. Next to that on the Lake of Mexico, I imagine that this is the largest collection of waterfowl on earth. That night, when our people were at supper, there was an attempt made to carry off one of our horses. The alarm was given, not by the dogs, which only barked as usual, but by the women, who set up a frightful yelling \u2014 the classic ululatus. We had pitched a little way from the tents to avoid the noise. After this, men were drafted from the douar to sleep and watch all round us. The robbers were suspected to be of the tribe of Azamor, near Mequinez, two of which tribe were sitting at supper with our people at the very time. The whole of the next day we travelled along the shore of the lake. We had in sight before us a range of hills, one of which was covered with snow ; and here snow upon a mountain in the middle of winter is the sign of a greater height than it would be with us in the middle of summer. I performed most of the journey on foot, wearing only shirt and drawers ; and I got away from the party that I might have a better chance of seeing the people, and I always met with the utmost kindness. They were always surprised that I was on foot, but never that I was alone. I was invited to their tents ; or they would"], [686, "198 ATTACK BY DOGS. come running from a distance, bringing milk. I was amused with the alertness with which they always set to work to teach me Arabic words. About sunset, and after travelling ten hours, we came to the head of the lake, and chose for pitching, a sward on a projecting angle running into it, and some hundred yards from a douar. This was the first time that we got away from the tents, and! re velled in recalling the night's repose of Eastern travel. The Arabs came and helped us to pitch ; brought us all we required, and then made a blazing fire of cork-bark. As the night closed in, the water-fowl near us in the angle of the lake, came swimming in to a clump of bulrushes not fifty yards distant, just as tame ducks might do. There is abundance of boars in the neighbourhood ; and the Sheik offered to turn out with all his tribe if I would stay or re turn for a day's hunting. Next morning, while the animals were lading, I strayed along the water's edge, and was suddenly assailed by a rush of dogs from the tents.

When the interpreter came up, I learnt that my deliverer was the wife ' of the Sheik : she was a comely middle-aged woman, with a head to delight a phrenologist. She said she had a question to ask me, if I would answer her. On my promising to do so, she resumed : \" You have come to our country, and seen it : now, tell me which is best, your country or ours?\" I answered her, \"God is the father of all men, and the maker of all lands, and he has given to his children the land that best suits each : your country is good for you, and ours for us.\" I in my turn proposed a question : \u2014 \" In your country, which is a good country, tell me what is the best thing % \" She reflected, and said, \" We have no good things.\" I then asked, \" What are your bad things V She answered, \"God's evils.\" The explanation was, \"old age and bad weather.\" I told her that, if she had seen my country, she would know that with them the one was rare and the other late. She then asked how much I had seen of their country ; and having told her that I had been into Shavoya, and amongst the Ziaides, she began to expatiate on her own \"tribe. \"God,\" she said, \"has given us a fertile and a pretty land ; he has given us plain, and forest, and marsh ; he has put a sea beyond the hills, that no one should harm us ; we have a lake that has fish aud birds ; we have cattle, sheep, milk, and"], [688, "200 THE PRIMITIVE BOAT. butter ; we have reeds, honey, and firewood ; we have corn in store, and gold and silver ; and, if we live under tents, and not in the city, it is because we choose it.\" Our conversation was put an end to by the rest of the tribe thronging around us ; and an old woman entertaining, or pretending, great alarm, a little pantomime was suddenly improvised. The Sheik formally announced that they had in their tents a slave escaped from England, whom it was their intention to deliver up that I might take her away, upon which they recounted her services and merits to show how useful a slave she was that they were giving up \u2014 and one of her services was to supply the douar with wild sows' milk. On this the old woman ran for her life, and all the children after her : she was, however, caught, brought back, and delivered up, and by this time our horses were laden and we took our leave. Nothing can exceed the richness of the women's hair \u2014 it falls like clusters of black grapes or knots of snakes : it is plaited on both sides of the head, and falls behind. They increase its volume by silk or worsted cords ; and I could not help thinking that the hair of the women of Carthage was not so despi cable a substitute for standing rigging, especially if they used, as the Jewesses to-day, a turban of silk thread (shoualif) made to imitate it. I here saw one of the boats. It was certainly the great grandfather of skiffs ; the hollow tree, or mono xyllo, is to it a modern invention. It was simply"], [689, "201 DERIVATION OF WORDS. a bundle of rushes tied together, and raised at the point like an Indian canoe, with \" thwarts,\" to keep it hollow : it was open at the stern, and floated merely by the buoyancy of the rushes. It had nothing in the form of fastening ; no rulucks ; and was pro pelled by a pole. I now saw the \" basket \" * in which the mother of Moses placed her child, and which does not exactly tally with the notions of Poussin and Guercino. The name of the rushes is scaif, and that is the Arabic for ship. When I heard it before, I thought it must have been derived from the Greek axtispn, which again is derived from oxairru, to hollow out ; whence also cxot-xr^, a digger, axucpn, a ditch. If this be so, then the Arabs, in borrowing their word from the Greeks, proceeded to call by the same name a plant spread over the whole land ; displacing the ancient name \u2014 which it must have had, as also the roots made from it, a thousand years \u2014 and before the Greek islands were visited by Cadmus. If this is too absurd, then the Arabs called the boats after the reed, and the Greeks, adopting from them the name, constructed out of it this root, their verb to hollow, and all its derivatives. The modern Greeks have not this word, but have taken the Arabic one for caravan (xagdfii).

After quitting the lake we ascended a hill, and passed by a saint's tomb. I had not been so close to one before, and was surprised at their not leading me away from it. There were quantities of rushes lying around for sleeping on, and I found that it was a common practice for travellers to sleep there, as in the Heroa of Greece, where they were always secure. They even asked me if I had ever slept in one, so that the fanaticism of the towns is here unknown. The snow-white saints' tombs are very beautiful, seen across the lakes, and reflected in them. The resemblance was striking with the Mussulman tombs of India. The half-globe is placed on the cube, and within the spandril the Gothic arch. Whether was the Indian building derived from the Moorish, or this from the Indian ; for as yet, as in the other parts of Moorish architecture, I had not seen any natural type or human work from which it could be derived. The tents, however, had now assumed a new form, and looked like cottages, being closed in at the bottom by mats of reeds, made into hurdles, over which the tent itself stood, like a roof. The popu lation is here more stationary.

As we advanced, we found numbers of these bee hives, sometimes one to each tent, and used as dormi tories for the children.* While I was considering the origin of the tombs, I observed one of these cones, against which a square hurdle had been placed to close the orifice, and there was in rushes the perfect model of the stone building. The round hole is the origin of the horse-shoe arch, which is a circle slit down. The walls of the tombs are finished off with the ornaments, to represent the obtruding ends of the reeds in the hurdles. I was confirmed in this supposition when, on asking the name of the reeds, I was answered, Kasob, which is the name of a fortress, Kasaba.

Indeed, funeral rites constitute in a great degree our idea of the life of antiquity, as funeral monuments furnish the largest proportion of its records. But, if we are thus moved in reading of what existed thousands of years ago, and are made to partake in the, to us, strange veneration that con secrated the tomb into a temple * \u2014 that converted it into a sanctuary for the criminal \u2014 that made it sacrilege to tread upon the grave f \u2014 that enjoined * \" Fuit in tectis de marmore templum, Conjugis antiqui miro quod honore colebat.' t Treasure also was placed in them, and used perhaps cen turies after, as a last resource, in the necessities of state.

Treading the Continent that bears the load of the Pyramids, the sight of these tombs suggests other reflections : the connexion of the honour of the dead with judgment on his acts \u2014 with recompense and punishment, and therefore with an after-existence \u2014 with a Creator of man, the Giver of life, the Re ceiver of the soul.* They prepared for the belief in a future state by creating for themselves a future here ; and in the treatment of their mortal remains lay punishments and rewards, that surpassed any that present things, except in this anticipation, could furnish. In after times there was a superstitious veneration for the dead \u2014 not so in early times. The corpse was judged by those who had witnessed its life, before it received the honours of sepulture. Until this sen tence was pronounced, the body was an uncleanly thing, and polluted those whom it touched. And thus the denial of sepulture remained for ages the direst of misfortunes that could befall a man, and the darkest dishonour that could be inflicted on his kindred.

The height of the Pyramids assumed a scale in rating human conduct, and thereby conveyed the transcendant worth of those whose ashes they con cealed. The first, the greatest structures thus rose, not to shelter the living, but to receive the dead. I am describing what I see around me. This land contains no houses but for the dead. The few cities are formed of edifices that resemble tombs, being built upon their model, in the forms that mourning piety had devised, and by the arts that sepulchral edifices have preserved. So also have the arts sprung from their hallowing and judging the dead. Painting and sculpture have their origin in the art of embalming. The covering presented the human form ; the resemblance was completed by colour. The case that contained it was * Ahaziah was not suffered to be buried in the tomb of his fathers. \u2014 2 Kings viii. 16-21 ; 2 Chron. xxi.

A step further was, to present, instead of the corpse, the man as alive, as reposing on, or rising out of his tomb. These we have in Etruria, calling into being or adopting a new art \u2014 that of the potter. In the centre of Africa it is a custom among some of the tribes for mothers who have lost young children, to carry about with them little wooden dolls to represent them ; and to these they offer food when ever they themselves eat. Have we not here the origin of the imagines of the Romans, derived from the Etruscans, derived by them from the Egyptians, as by these from the Abyssinians, \u2014 beyond whom we cannot ascend ; and that people was the fellow race to the Lybians. And here we have uninterrupted the traditions which have floated down the Nile, crossed the Mediterranean, and flourished so long in ancient Europe. In a region where Islamism universally prevails,. we might expect few traces of pagan ceremonies, and here Islamism was the successor of Christianity, so that there had twice been the sweeping away of the old land-marks ; but here, at all events, it is not a thou sand years that have made any difference \u2014 the dif ferences are only in so far as positive change has been effected by some event \u2014 there has not been a per petual process of change going on.

Tread not where the dead repose ; it is holy ground ! not consecrated for their use, but hallowed by their presence : there the sorrowing festival is kept, there are gathered the mourners with the revolving sun ; there the feast of the dead is prepared and left for the stranger to partake, and bless the memory of the departed.

This negligence has cost more lives and suffering than probably all the swords of all the conquerors. Epidemics, ende mics, slow fever or rapid plague, ever present in deep vengeance or savage fury, are the produce of our enlightened contempt for superstitions, and mark the imbecility of that intellectual presumption which blights in our hands the fruits of science, the impulses of benevolence, and the benefits of freedom. There was no plague in ancient Egypt, thickly peopled as it was \u2014 they embalmed their dead ; elsewhere, when num bers rendered such precaution advisable, they were burned. But, where neither embalming nor burning was practised, they took care at once to remove the dead from the dwellings of the living, in appre hension of the evil consequences, and through respect for the repose of the departed. The scenes that may daily be witnessed in the metropolis of England, it would have been impossible for an ancient to have conceived, save as existing among some race of hitherto undiscovered savages destitute of the common instincts of nature.* We are now striving to remedy this evil by legis lative means.

But here, as in so many other instances, the work is done and the evil prevented by some simple and ancient habits, which are entered in the traveller's note-book as at best interesting curiosities, or amiable weaknesses. The superstition of the Mussulman lies, however, the other way, and hence the plague that ravages at present most other Mussulman countries, and which we shall see again in Europe \u2014 or rather in England \u2014 unless the condition of our London cemeteries be ameliorated. They do not, indeed, bury in the towns ; but, in making the grave, they leave a hollow space above the body, in the belief that it has to sit up finally, to surrender the soul to the angel of death. Boards are then placed two feet above the body, and over this but a slight covering of earth. Thus the gases from the decomposing flesh are collected, and escape ; and being heavier than the atmospheric air, flow around, seeking the lowest level, and pour down wards, so that when the cemetery is above the dwell ings, these are periodically subject to the plague. I have observed this so constantly, so regularly, that, on merely glancing at the position of a town, I can tell whether it is or is not subject to the plague, in what quarters it is so subject, and, judging by the winds that prevail, at what season.

SHEMISH, THE GARDENS OF THE HESPERIDES. We very soon came upon another lake which has no regular opening to the sea, though the bank of sand is occasionally moved. It must have been here that Don Sebastian projected making the en trance for his internal harbour ; but the lake with which this entrance communicates is of small ex tent, apparently of no great depth, and separated from the long lake by a neck of land of no great elevation, but which from its sandy nature it would be a great enterprise to cut through. We passed over a good deal of flat ground, like Hungary, com pletely under cultivation, and the fields perfectly clean : the douars had the look of villages, and we could scarcely believe that there were not built houses amongst them. Towards evening we came upon a country of a new aspect\u2014 broken ground, aluminous shale, covered with a straggling oak forest. Herds of cattle were pointed out to us, which were said to be turned out there to multiply without the care of man ; and we came upon a douar in the midst of this forest, where I was very much tempted to bivouac for the night."], [702, "214 LARACHE. It was like a scene in one of the wooded vales of Western Greece : however, we pushed on for La rache, the gardens of which we entered long after it was pitch-dark. The road between them was sand : there was no possibility of getting water either by fountain, stream, or well \u2014 such is the site of the Gardens of the Hesperides ! I had to post pone the satisfaction of my curiosity till the mor row's light, and entered the capital of the King of the Giants with that sort of reverence and awe which I had felt in approaching the ruins of Stone henge. We were led through a labyrinth of strange and precipitous streets, till we came down to the lower wall on the side of the harbour : the houses looked like the little tombs at Pompeii by the wayside. We were received by the English Consular Agent, a Genoese, whom, notwithstanding his European habi liments, we might have taken for a Moor by his quiet demeanour, and his unobtrusive attention to all our wants. A scene rose next morning such as deserved to shine on the groves of the Dana'ides. Before one sweeps with many a bend the stream, on whose tranquil breast reposes the wreck of the navy of Morocco \u2014 a corvette, two brigs, and a schooner. A high bank of sand shuts out the sea, save at the narrow bar. In front of the town a verdant plain is spread ; all round it flows the river, and beyond it rises an amphitheatre of broken hills of a lively mountain aspect, and with other forms and other"], [703, "215 SHEMISH. colours than those of the Zahel. Over these were scattered gardens ; but the gardens of Morocco, which, unlike those of any other land, are embellished by the bank of cactus, that serves them for a wall, and painted with the leaden green of the aloe. To the east, and opposite the sea entrance, there is a detached hill, like that upon which are situated the ruins of Epidaurus, a spot which must be ever green in the memory of travellers in Greece. Con sidering this to be a last chance of finding a Ph\u0153nician city, I commenced inquiries, and was told that the hill was covered with ruins which had been deserted from the memory of man, and that the hill was called Shemish. I at once determined to delay my journey in order to devise means to visit it. This was no easy matter, and I thought the best plan was to try and get into a boat without my guards, and then trust to chance and perseverance for being able to push on. Having no suspicion, they allowed me to get into a boat, accompanied by a soldier of the town. We embarked at a jetty, close to which lay in tier in a strong tide-way, four tolerably-sized European vessels, laden with corn, bark and wool, waiting for an opportunity of getting over the bar. We kept close to the bank of sand thrown up by the sea, behind which lay the dismantled and perishing vessels I have already mentioned. The water was much discoloured ; and, like that of the Seboo, bore traces of chalk. I observed something white on the"], [704, "216 DESCRIPTION OF bank : pulling to the spot, I found it really to be chalk, an outlyer standing on its edge. It was harder than the common chalk of England. The flints were large masses, and there was a coating on them of cry,stals of carbonate of lime. The masses of flints were evidently the same as those which had become gasule. Close by there was a hill like an artificial mound, and on it the regular sheep-walks of our chalk ranges. Under it we landed, as it adjoined Shemish and was connected with it by a low neck. The rocky eminence of Shemish is sandstone, not that which encrusts the Zahel, but a compact and ancient rock, and sometimes approaching to granular quartz. From the top of Shemish the prospect is striking, from the extraordinary windings of the river to the south and east : it turns back upon itself, more like the windings of a serpent than the meanderings of a stream. Hence it derives its name of Elcos, or the boa ; hence, too, the fable of the dragon. There was no fable in the guardianship. The protection was not in his folds, but in his foaming head \u2014 the bar that closed the entrance. In Pliny's time the little plain was only partially formed. \" At thirty-two thousand paces from this place (Tangier) is Lixos, of which the ancients relate so many fables, and which was made a colony by the cruelty of Claudius C\u00e6sar.

So, in like manner, the golden fruit of Lixos blossoms and ripens to this day, despite the incredulity of the Roman naturalist. These ruins have not been hitherto described ; they will soon be demolished. Walls which, I was told, had been some years ago continuous, and much higher than at present, surround the crest of an irre gular hill : the circuit may be three miles. Where I first came upon them I found walls in tapia and mortar, and stones, having entirely the Moorish character. I began to apprehend the repetition of the disappointment I had so often experienced. The rolled fragments of stone and lime would not alone do. I wanted some chiselling, and something to resemble the bulwarks which Nonnus tells us Cadmus (i. e. the Ph\u0153nician) gave to the hundred cities he planted in this border : \u2014 8g*k 8' eKaarfi Avo-pSara Xaiveois vs\\rovpeva rei^ea nipyots."], [706, "218 THE RUINS AND And I did come on evidences indisputable. These were hewn stone, neither Roman, Hellenic, nor Cy clopic. They were large, not in regular tiers, nor polygonal, and joined with cement. One stone which I measured was ten feet by three. The angles were thus constructed. The walls were in rude work of stone and lime, which, but for the connexion in which I found them, might have passed for recent. They exactly resemble the ruins which are called \" Old Tangier.\" I now at length did see a Ph\u0153nician wall, and knew what it was.

Near it there is the circular end of a building, standing about twenty feet in height and thirty in diameter. There were long, vaulted chambers, in pairs, like congreve locks, arched and double, twenty feet long, six feet wide, and twelve feet high. They were scattered all over the place, within the walls and without. I went into nine or ten of them. There was no mark of water on the sides. I hardly think they could have been cisterns. I could not imagine to what use they were destined.-f- This was all I could make out by scrambling through the thick brushwood for the greater portion of the day. * The Spaniards occupied Larache under Philip IL, and lost it under Philip III.

The branches of the wild olive are rounded like the oak, and do not, like those of the grafted tree, adjust themselves to the form of the buildings in which they have struck root, as in the ruins of Greece and Italy. They are here thickly planted, and their roots and branches are so many wedges driven into the walls. I observed a stone, which could not be under ten tons, lifted up from the top of a wall, between the branches of a tree, which again was yielding under its weight. It reminded me of the admired, but false, metaphor of Lamartine, when he compares the heart, early love stricken, to a tree that bears aloft the hatchet-head, which had been buried in its stem. The rock was covered with a variety of plants, which would have presented a rich harvest to a botanist : I can notice but some belonging to the times of old. Hesperus, fresh leaping from the ocean, here found in every season all flowers for his wreath ; the lotus, the myrtle, and the palm ; the pine, the arar, which repre sents the cypress. The acanthus covered the ground with its deep green, glossy, and spreading leaves. The ivy, instead of crawling over stones or trunks, spreads over the boughs of trees, and hangs in festoons between them, with a thin cord-like stem, and delicate leaves studding it upon either side.

I took one of its long shoots, and wreathed it into a chaplet, and placed it on the head of one of the wine-denying Moors, a boatman who had accompanied me, and he was no less delighted at the implied courtesy than I at the real beauty of the object. Perhaps, however, the connexion of the ivy and Bacchus may be no more than a pun. To him were consecrated a plant and a bird, and both had the same name, xto-aot. and xiaaog, the magpie and the ivy. Bochart makes out the proper name of Bacchus to have been nearly the same, and himself the chief of the first of the wine-growing countries, the founder of an empire which conquered India, and which has left behind monuments to substantiate any fable which Greek fancy could create. In fact, Bacchus is no other than Chus, or Bar Ghusii, whom we call Nimrod, and the Greeks Nebrodes, being a great hunter, and therefore painted with the skins of wild animals \u2014 chiefly the tiger, or nimra \u2014 the spoils of which cover the shoulders of Bacchus, while the captive animal is yoked to his car.

The leaves are set along it alter nately, and these are soft, glossy, delicate in texture and elegant in form, and yet of extraordinary dura bility ; and the twigs are just the length required for a chaplet : a red berry hangs to the leaf by a fine thread, while simultaneously it bears the flower, which is a small star of six fleshy points, of the palest green, with an amethyst cup in the centre.* The tree of Minerva, in all its stubborn and unsub jugated vigour, here flourishes in scorn on Neptune's border, and the oak of Jupiter, presenting food for man, completes the assemblage of these leafy remini scences of time gone by, veiling the grey ruins that the elements had not yet destroyed, nor man laid low.

It was not till the latter time, and in her struggles with Rome, that she sought to govern and possess, according to our present notions ; and it was in Sicily and Spain that she set her hands to this craft, and brought down her own ruin. The greatness of Carthage was founded on the confidence that the native population had in her integrity. Punica fides could not have been turned to a reproach, had it not at first represented a truth.

It was exactly what the Libo-Ph\u0153nician cities were, as its name alone suffices to show ; for Emporion is not, as is supposed, a Greek, but a Ph\u0153nician word, and all these cities had the generic name of Empori\u00e6, having their proper name besides. Like Tyre, Empori\u00e6 was originally on an island : on being abandoned, it was called in like manner Pal\u0153opolis.

There is no botany, no horticulture; their taste is ignorant. Their love of flowers is not as they are arranged in classes, multiplied in leaves, or varied in colours \u2014 it is for themselves \u2014 their natural forms, their pure colours, and their sweet odours. It is un obtrusive and silent, or vocal only as in the verses of Solomon and the songs of the Troubadours. \" A man may be a good botanist,\" said Rousseau, \" although he does not know the name of a single plant.\" The Easterns do not like to come empty-handed, and the commonest, as the fairest, flowers suffice. But it is not a nosegay or a bouquet, but a flower that they present. The leaf and stem are to them just as beautiful as the blossom ; and a bundle of heads of flowers would appear to them much like a heap of human heads. In the numerous Chinese figures and ornaments that encumber our tables and rooms, it may be observed that, wherever there are flowers, they are single, each by itself in a vase. A piece of pottery has recently been brought to England from the Greek Islands : it is unique, and no de scription has been discovered of its uses. It is a vase about four inches in diameter, surrounded with"], [721, "EUROPEAN GARDENS. 233 two circles of very small vases, which stand out from it : it is evidently for flowers, and so placed that each should have its own stalk and vessel. The Moors also have a flower-dish for the room : the top in pierced pottery, so that each stands by itself. One of the things which in Europe have shamed me most in the presence of an Eastern is the bouquet, or painted cauliflower head, in the hand of a lady. Alas! that perversion of taste should always fasten on her fairest subjects ! Their weeds, stunted in our hot-houses, are their chief embellishments ; the cactus, for instance, and the aloe. Here the one bears flowers like a standard, and the other fruit like a flower. Without science, numbers of plants, or skill in rearing and combining de licate and diverse natures, a garden rises to something infinitely beyond our ideas, whether of use or gran deur. So may it be traced on the Nile in the palmy days of the Pharaohs, on the Xenil in those of the Abderachmans, no less than at Jerusalem and Babylon. The Hanging Gardens were the least like what a European would expect : the authenticity of the con current testimony of Diodorus Siculus, Quintus* Cur tius, and Josephus has consequently been questioned.

At Nineveh, the tree of life is associated with the living, not the dead. As the sun set in the west, and as the west was considered to be the place to which the spirits repaired, their abode, Hezperi, came to mean the evening, or Hesperus. The site of the Hesperides can admit, therefore, of no doubt or ambiguity ; and the name given to another part * \" The Assyrians were probably also the inventors of the parks or paradises which were afterwards maintained with so much sumptuousness by the Persian kings of the Archime dian and Sassanian dynasties.

These paradises were stocked, not only with some of every kind, but with various trees, shrubs, and plants ; and were watered by numerous artificial streams.

Their gardens may still be described as copses of fruit-trees, as is naturally to be expected in the country of the orange, lemon, and citron, when flower, foliage, verdure, shade, and fruit were all combined \u2014 not evanescent in an hour, or exchanging their merits, but combined in one, and enduring nearly throughout the year. The orange, in a hot country, is the very excellence of fruit ; and, if we were not familiarised with its form and flavour, the aspect of a Moorish garden of that description would prompt all that the same sight prompted to the Greeks of old. A peculiarity of their gardening is, that they do not mix the different kinds. The Jews were for bidden to mix the olive and the vine ; and Solomon speaks of a garden of nuts (it should be almonds). This is the fashion here : the garden is a square \u2014 it is again laid out in squares, in the way that we dispose a farm for rotation crops. Thus, the gardens of the Sultan at Morocco are divided off into almonds, pomegranates, figs, pears, cherries. The square divi sions are separated by alleys of the dimensions of streets, but some greater than others. Columns run along; and above these, and partly down the sides, there is a fret-work of bamboo ; over these are trained vines, the clusters depending through the trellis (as seen in the Egyptian tombs). Jessamine (the large white and yellow flower) and other plants are trained"], [726, "238 TREES IN MOORISH GARDENS AND up the columns, and festooned around them. Through these alleys you ride on horseback ; and at the inter sections there are vast halls, like that I have de scribed at Kitan, of bamboo fret-work : the portals and openings imitate windows, and are twined and matted with various creepers. On both sides of the alleys flow the rivulets for irrigation ; and, there being no weeds or under verdure, you have the refreshing coolness without the effects of rank vegetation. The style of the private gardens is the same. Oranges and lemons are, however, classed by them selves. They are planted together, and in certain proportions, viz. the orange sweet and bitter, the lemon sweet and bitter, the citron large and small \u2014 in all, nearly a dozen varieties. A garden of this kind is called quorce. The common orange has evidently been a graft from the East, for it is called chin : in Um and rungh may be found the root of our lemon and orange. To the eastward, the Arabs call the orange Berdkou. Portugal is so caUed by the Greeks, &c. ; and probably that general name which it has acquired in the Levant comes from the Portu guese traffic when they were in possession of the ports of Barbary. So recent is the introduction of these plants in the East, that I have been shown the stumps of the two trees first planted in the island now most cele brated for their growth, and where the gardens re semble those of Barbary, having the three varieties"], [727, "239 THE TREES OF MOROCCO. mixed together. This island is Naxos : the two trees are called Adam and Eve, and they say they were brought by the Venetians. That, of course, is a mistake, but it shows that they came from the West. Throughout the country the trees are generally evergreens \u2014 the olive, wild and cultivated, the cork, oak, the arar, the locust, the palm, the palmetto, the orange and lemon, the lotus and myrtle, and, finally, the Barbary fig and aloe, which give to the land its tropical and ideal character. The whole country is covered with what are our garden flowers ; so that now, in the depth of winter, there is no sign of the hoary monarch save in the gardens, where the fruit trees are naked ; but these leafless copses did not suffice, under a glowing sun and with a verdant land scape, to cool, even in thought, the summer breath into a winter chill. They merely looked like withered trees, and the gardens were the only spots that did not smile. I speak of those that were scattered along our road, not of the septs of pale blue fantastic vegetation enclosing the dark shining groves of quorce (orange and lemon) that grace the banks of the Lixus. It is not without reason that the cactus is called the Barbary fig. It grows so abundantly and luxu riantly, and is so well adapted to the soil and climate ; flourishing in the arid sand, covering it with a grate ful shade, fertilizing it with its thick succulent branches as they fall, fostering other plants by its shelter, and furnishing in abundance a healthy and refreshing crop of fruit, which fringes or studs its"], [728, "240 THE PRICKLY PEAR. gigantic leaves.* The fig has a thick rind, which is pared off : this, in Spain, is treasured up for the pigs.

The Spaniards call it Tuna, as having been imported from Tunis ; the Shillohs of Sus call it Tacanarete, as if it had come to them from the Canary Islands. There is but one people who have boldly adopted it, and that is the Mexicans, who have taken it as their national emblem, and have associated it upon their coins with the shashea, or Barbary cap, intended to represent Liberty.

The aloe bears no fruit : the stalk of the blossom serves for the purposes of light timber. It blossoms about the seventh year, and then dies : it rises from the seed that falls. They are not acquainted with the liquor, like soured milk (yourt), which the Mexi cans draw from it (pulke) by tapping.

The same rule prevails here ; and there is a common shepherd and cowherd who comes for the cattle in the morning and brings them home at night. The gardens are small squares, divided off internally with rows of taU reeds. There is a plank door with lintels ; all the rest of the enclosure is of growing plants. The soil is generally sand : here in the gardens above the town, and through which I passed last night, it is nothing but sand, and its fertility depends on the shelter afforded it. The tall reeds fence it round ; there is then a path on the four sides, on the inner side of the path fruit-trees ; and the centre, between the trees and the path adjoining the reeds, is covered with a trellis, over which vines are trained. The smaller ones are without trees ; so that, as you peep into them, they look like large rooms or corridors. They say that the smell of the cistus cools one : I fancied I experienced the sflme effect in looking at the mirage-like colours of the cactus and aloe.

The aloe is the outer fence, or chevaux de-frise, the cactus rising higher within : through these are mingled the tall slender reeds, as if to unite in one bond the three most dissimilar things in nature. Together, they form a fence which might delay an army, and present to the archer Ph\u0153bus a testudo which defies his shafts. On the coast, the heat is tempered by the sea breezes at the hottest times of the year and day ; but the influence of these winds is lost as they pass inwards, and in three or four miles they become themselves heated.

The gum from it, the ladanum, is much esteemed as incense, and is also mixed with mastic to flavour the breath by chewing it. It is not col lected in this district. The ancient story of its being scraped from goats\" beards does not seem improbable ; for in breaking through the copses one's head and clothes become quite clammy. The odour is not from the flower, but from the leaves of the plant : the flowers are of the slightest texture, but make a lively show, bespangling the bushes with stars of white or red. They look like roses, and I was constantly reminded of York and Lancaster. These flowers live but for a day ; and, constantly tempting the eye and inviting the hand, the prize is relinquished as soon as reached, and never was a cistus blossom twined into chaplet or gathered for a nosegay. Yet, when it clothes the rocky steep, or mantles the swelling slope, there is no plant can rival it in the pleasure it gives and the attention it awakens. It is shrub and flower ; the frailty of its blossoms, the down of its waxy leaves, the balm of its fragrance, are so unlike the glancing foliage of other shrubs \u2014 the hot-house forms, the dyer tints, and perfumer scent of other flowers, \u2014 that it makes them look children of art and care : wild and tender, it is to other flowers as a shepherdess among women, and to other shrubs as an Arab among the races of men."], [737, "BETWEEN LARACHE AND ARZELA. 249 Shrubs with their sturdy life, flowers in their fleeting passage, serve to embellish the scene, and to adorn the actors. This one rather shares in our humanity : as our generations go to the grave and are renewed again, so it knows vicissitude, and joy, and mourning. It spreads forth its birth of blossoms with the early dawn, and strews with the fallen leaves the earth of eve. Was it from this that the Greeks called it \" flower of the sun ;\" because, like the rainbow, it drew its being from his rays 1 Like the peri, its life was in a charm, and it died when that charm was gone. The name \"flower of the sun\" (helio-anthemum) reminds me of the grossest of Flora's daughters \u2014 a garden Cleon, too gaudy for a vegetable, too meagre for a shrub, too thick and hard for a flower. And to this \u2014 the very contrast of the cistus \u2014 do we abandon the name selected for it by the Greeks ! There is a variety of the broom which might be esteemed a garden flower ; it is a miniature plant, eighteen inches or two feet, and\u2014 so to speak \u2014 one incrustation of yellow blossom. While underwood is reduced to the size of a garden-flower, the common daisy is raised to the pretensions of one, with its large head on a stalk of twenty inches. All the plants were our garden tribes, or what would be wild with us, and were well qualified for a garden \u2014 the broom as I have said, the ivy, then the ranges of cactus and aloe, hyacinths, jonquils, irises with the petals coloured green.

It is a bush two or three feet high, and showing no stem. Here it rose to ten feet, with snake-like stems carrying the sharp spicular masses of fans of glossy or glit tering green. I several times made an endeavour to stop, that I might pass the night in one of the villages, as I should now call them ; not only seduced by the amenities around, but also partly out of consideration for our jaded cattle and scarcely less exhausted self : but guides and guards were inexorable. It was a settled thing that that night we should sleep at Arzela ; so we pushed or dragged along, as it seemed, in chace of it, for it never could be in the map the distance we found it by the road. At last we descried its lines, tinged by the last reflected light, against the leaden mass of the Atlantic. We soon after entered \" The Gardens,\" and then approached the castellated gate, where, to our infinite surprise, an anxious people awaited us. For several days we had been expected. Rumour had preceded us, and dealt kindly by us; and we were gazed at with eager countenances and smiling eyes, and some of them bright ones. By some process, strange and capricious, we were no strangers, and the denizens vied with each other in doing us any good turn which fell in their way, in expressing their delight at our arrival, and in welcoming us to their town. The crowd was hurrying us in a direction which they had evidently settled in their minds we should"], [739, "RECEPTION AT ARZELA. 251 take. I having some voice, as I thought, in the matter, made bold to ask, \"Whither away?\" \"To Abra ham's ! to Abraham's !\" was shouted. On this I reined in \u2014 I mean, I ceased thrashing ; for the memory of sleepless nights among those conversational Jews, and some other discomforts which need not be repeated, and a habit of looking somewhat higher than an Israelite's abode, with a disinclination to step down in the world, came all upon me, and prompted the emphatic declaration, \" We will pitch without the walls.\" No sooner had the words passed my lips than I could have bitten my tongue off. My eye had fallen on a countenance of singular amenity, and \u2014 although that of an aged man \u2014 of grace : a long white beard hung down his breast, giving to the figure the patriarchal cast, which his lineaments vin dicated as legitimately their own by blood as well as bearing. A cloud passed over his features ; \u2014 the impress was so slight that I cannot say I saw, but I felt it. So recovering, as it were, my sentence, and inclining to him, I added to the interpreter in Spanish, \" unless we are to go to my father's house.\" We entered a small court : the floor -was red, the walls were pure white. There was no window. Four Moorish arches opened to four separate chambers : two sons with their wives occupied two, his brother and uncle the third, and himself the fourth. Whether these were houses or apartments it was not easy to determine : our words cannot explain. Notwithstand ing many attempts at description, no one who has"], [740, "252 DESCRIPTION OF A not seen these houses has any distinct idea of them. The same holds with respect to the descriptions left us of ancient dwellings. The one explains the other : perhaps, by making them serve mutually for this purpose, I may be in some degree successful. This court and hall, for which we have no word, is the patio of the Spaniards, the woost of the Arabs, the hyroob of the Hebrews, the [biaov of the Greeks, and the impluvium or cavadium of the Romans. The patio is covered with an awning, which the Moors call clas ; they have also a covering for the floor, which they use on festivities, and which they call yellis : the clas, the same as the velum, which the Romans spread over their atrium \u2014 in Greek it was ?iy/j. The roof was riyog, hence the confusion respecting the paralytic man being let down \" through the roof\" r'iyr\\, which was simply the removal ofthe tent or awning to let him down, not into the house, but into the court. They ascended to the roof among the tiles,\"\"\" and unroofed the roof,f and so let down the bed into the middle. Here are all familiar words, and nothing can be plainer than the words, however incomprehensible may be the thing conveyed ; for how should a roof be unroofed (cmors ydrry 77)11 areyrjii), and how should the people below have remained quiet under the tiles and rafters'? But, translate the passage by the aid of the Moorish house, and all difficulty is removed : \" They ascended to the top of the house, among the tiles (umfBdvrsg * Luke v. 19. + Mark ii. 4."], [741, "MOORISH HOUSE AT ARZELA. 253 It) to oSijJjcc S/\u00ab tuv xsgd(//a>v) ; and then, removing the awning which was spread over the place where he was, they let him down into the patio.\" The tiles were for flooring the terrace- top, and coping the parapet walls. Thus the centre of the house re mained, as it were, the tent, and explains the pas sage, \" the tabernacle of my house ; \" as also that one, \" Thou spreadest out the heavens as a curtain ;\" and again, \"He stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.\" The French word maison comes from the Greek (jtiii7t7ov, architecture. The French house is a solid figure, the ancient house a hollow one. The build ing of the house in Greek is olxog : the court in the middle is called [Mo-trot,. The families of the poor inhabit different apartments : the court becomes the common place of resort, and its name will stand for that of the whole dwelling, as \"hall\" in English is, in the country, used to designate a gentleman's seat. But here it is the abode of the lower orders, which would undergo the change, and the word would become vernacular : olxog becoming (/jiaaov, we have at once maison. In Spain, common courts are called meson coral. Coro, coral, corte came, in like manner, to signify residence of the monarch : thus, the Court of Madrid. (\" Solo Madrid es corte.\")* Architecture spread in France from the Phocian * Ford, in the \" Hand-book of Spain,\" quotes this sentence as if it were a presumption of the Spaniards, that there was no other court in the world save their own."], [742, "254 DESCRIPTION OF A colony of Marseilles, and through Europe from the peninsula, and so the one word spread in France, the other through Europe. It is curious that the French word for a house should mean the same thing as the English word for a chamber, both being in direct contradiction to the thing conveyed, which is not \" space,\" but \" enclosure.\" This form of Canaanitish building is preserved in our monasteries, cloisters, and colleges. Spain and Sicily preserve some beautiful specimens of the pas sage of Moorish into Gothic forms, where the luxury and gaiety of the woost is associated with the sombre severity of the cloister, \u2014 the stone-framed and fretted Gothic arches and windows \u2014 the Moorish tiles\u2014 the gloomy corridors around, and flowers smiling in the centre amidst water and refreshed by fountains. To the apartment of the chief of the establishment there was an entrance-hall twelve feet square and sixteen to eighteen feet high ; the floor red like the court, and the walls white. A balcony at one side, reached by a ladder, served for two or three persons to sleep, and gave entrance to a small \" chamber on the wall,\" such as that of Elisha in the house of the Shunamite. The \"upper chamber,\" such as David's, \"over the gate,\" judging from what we at present see, was a building on the roof, being reached by a ladder or external staircase : \u2014 a ladder is a common domestic instrument. The chambers built there are strictly beit ; but to the westward it receives the name from the Arabs of olea, which is the word in"], [743, "MOORISH HOUSE AT ARZELA. 255 the Old Testament translated \"upper chamber.\" It was the hyperoon of the Greeks, in which Homer places Penelope to avoid her suitors. The Lace demonians called the same apartment oon ; and Athe n\u00e6us explains by it the fable of Helen born from an egg. The gynaicum of the Greeks was the upper story ; and at present, amongst the Moors, who have no harem for the women, the tops of the houses are appropriated to them, and no man can ascend to make repairs, or for any other purpose, without pro claiming aloud three times that he is going up to the roof. David, in the story of Bathsheba, was clearly where he ought not to have been, and where no man was expected to be, and had neglected to give the customary warning. But this door, or archway, led to the inner apart ment, \u2014 one of the ordinary long Moorish rooms, about seven feet wide and thirty feet long, and re ceiving light only from the door. The floor was covered with their beautiful mats, and the walls all round, to the height of four feet : the rest was white. The entrance to these rooms is by the centre, and they thus form separate apartments to the right and left, at the end there being generally a raised bed divided off by hangings. When I first saw the bed steads, I took them for an imitation of us, for they are altogether repugnant to Eastern ideas. In the East a bed-room is unknown : even in the harem there is no apartment so appropriated, far less is there a bed-stead. Where \"bed-rooms\" are mentioned,"], [744, "MOORISH AND EASTERN \" BED-ROOMS.' 256 what is meant is a place for stowing beds. Large presses are filled at the \" lower\" parts of rooms for this purpose. The bed, when made, is taken out and raised three or four mattresses, one over the other. In the centre of the oda it looks like a long ottoman. The pillows are composed as a \" formation \" of very thin, broad flaps or cushions of cotton, so that you get exactly the required height, and they fit into the neck, and do not require a head-board to keep them in. No standing post is required ; and all this is from the matrix of the tent. Here it is exactly the reverse, and might well surprise at first. The matrix here is the fortress, the walled cities of Canaan. Here every apartment is a bedroom : not only are the beds com posed of standing posts, but they are the standing parts of the rooms, divided off by hangings, like those of the Temple, for it is not curtains round them, but hangings that are before them. The room is built of the width requisite for them. There is sometimes a standing top, which serves as a balcony, and also to sleep on. The bed is called farash, the hangings numasia, and there are generally behind two square holes through the wall, for light and air. Mittah is the word used in Scripture : it is spoken of as a standing thing, and the expression going up, exactly corresponds with what we see here. The stand ing bedstead of Og King of Bashan is referred to in testimony of his gigantic dimensions. At a feast the Moors place the honoured person in the bed. On mar riage-feasts the bridegroom, amidst his party, and the"], [745, "HIGHLAND BEDSTEADS. 257 bride amidst hers, recline on the bed. When a fete is made in honour of any person, he is placed on the bed, looking down on the parties assembled round the trays, the whole length of the room. It might, in fact, be translated rather throne than bed. So also at a Jewish wedding, you may see in one bed three tiers of blooming virgins, sparkling in gold and jewels, with their shot green and red silk hand kerchiefs \u2014 and within the hangings of one curtain, one bouquet, presenting more beauty than you could select from any European court. In the Highlands a strange piece of furniture is the bedstead, which is of wood, with doors like a press, and standing enclosed and against the wall : it is, doubtless, derived from the customs I describe. The Highlanders used to make these bedsteads themselves, as Ulysses did his. A peculiarity of the Moorish room is, that the beams are visible, being ornamented with either carving or colour, or both : this we have prepserved in the grander Gothic architecture. So it was among the Jews : \" Ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion.\" Vermilion is the ground of their patterns, and pre- dominates. The colour is neither laid on with oil, nor in fresco, but with white of egg ; it works well and lasts long. The beams are of the arar, which in ancient and modern times has been confounded with cedar. In the Roman and Greek house, as in the Hebrew, the rooms were entered from the centre court ; but VOL. ii. s"], [746, "258 ASSYRIAN HOUSES THE the former had their greatest extension in the length, that is from the court; the latter, in the breadth, that is parallel to the court. The same contrast holds between the Turkish and the Moorish. The former has not the Impluvium, but the Divan houe, or cen tral hall of the house, corresponds to it ; out of this you pass to the rooms, which are squares, exactly as Vitruvius describes the Triclinium, with a rectangle added, the top being opposite the door and giving the light, being nearly an unbroken side of window.* The Moorish is the most complete antithesis, having an extensive breadth ; having two \" tops \" opposite each other ; having no window, and receiving its light from an enormous door. An apartment may be thirty feet by seven feet, or in length nearly five times its breadth. We have had at Nimroud the perfect con firmation that this was the ancient form in the East : the same proportions are there observed in far grander dimensions.! Mr. Layard accounts for the form by the want of timber to construct wider roofs ; but that would not give the inordinate length ; and, besides, they were acquainted \u2014 as he shows \u2014 with the arch. * See the chapter on \" the Oda,\" in the \" Spirit of the East.\" t \" The great narrowness of all the rooms, when compared with their length, appears to prove that the Assyrians had no means of constructing a roof requiring other support than that afforded by the side walls. The most elaborately ornamented hall at Nimroud, although above one hundred and sixty feet in length, was only thirty-five feet broad. The same disparity is apparent in the edifice at Konyunjik. It can scarcely be doubted that there was some reason for making the rooms so narrow.\" \u2014 Nineveh, vol. ii. p. 255."], [747, "259 PROTOTYPE OF MOORISH- The form being adopted to suit the settled manner, and with reference to the bed, then of course the heavy roof could be laid on with short beams ; and that the same masses of pounded earth for the terraces were there employed as in Barbary, the condition of the Assyrian ruins plainly shows. The Greeks had a mixed architecture. They had the Phrygian tombs ; and they must have had also roofs made in this fashion \u2014 at least, at an early time \u2014 as is recorded in the story of Melampus ; who, being confined by Iphiklos, for attempting to carry off his cattle, heard the worms in the roof discoursing on the unsafe con dition of the beams. They have such gates as Samson carried from Gaza, or Lord Ellenborough sent for to Cabul, and are traced on the sepulchre of the kings at Jerusalem : they do not fit into the wall, but lie against it. They are not shaped to the arch ; they close, but rectan gularly and folding ; they cover it as the hurdle did the orifice of the rush mosques I saw along the lake. There is no hinge, but the joints of the door descend into a socket in the stone, and in like manner the door is secured above in a projecting bracket of wood. In the smallest buildings it is colossal. To exclude the air or the cold they close the folding doors, and open a small wicket as in the gate of a fortress ; above it there are small apertures through the wall to let in the light when it is closed, and these are arranged in a figure or a pattern.

He then went back to Mahmoud, whom he claimed as his \" friend.\" I launched out in praise of the dignity of his reign, and the justice of that of Soliman. He related various anecdotes of both. A governor brought presents of one hundred of everything that the country contained : horses, oxen, mules, sheep, slaves, quintals of silver, packets of gold dust (about a pound weight each), measures of corn, oil, butter, &c. The Sultan asked him whence came this wealth. He said from the government which his bounty had conferred upon him. He asked him if the people had not paid their tenths. The governor said they had. The Sultan then said, \" I sent you to"], [749, "SULTANS SOLIMAN AND MAHMOUD. 261 govern, not to rob,\" and gratified him with the bas tinado and prison. The grandfather of Ben Abou, the present Governor of Riff, when Caid of Tangier, made a great feast at the marriage of his daughter. One of his friends, Caid Mohammed Widden, observed a poor man in mean attire in the court, and ordered him out ; and, he not obeying, pushed him so that he fell. That same night the keeper of an oven (there are no sellers of bread, every one makes his own bread at home and sends it to the oven) had barred his door and retired to rest, when some one knocked at the door. He asked, \" Who is there 1 \" and was answered, \" The guest of God,\" which means a beggar. \" You are welcome,\" he said, and got up and unfastened the door ; and having nothing but some remnants of the koscoussou from his supper, and the piece of mat upon which he lay, he warmed the koscoussou in the oven, and after bringing water to wash his guest's hands, he set it before him : he then conducted him to the mat, and himself lay down on the bare ground. In the morning when he awoke, he found the door unbarred, and the poor man gone ; so he said to him self, \" He had business and did not wish to disturb me, or he went away modestly, being ashamed of his poverty.\" On taking up the mat he found under it two doubloons ; so he was afraid, and put the money by, and determined not to touch it, lest it had been forgotten, or lest the poor man had stolen it, and put it there to ruin him."], [750, "262 THE CAID, OVEN-KEEPER, AND SULTAN.

Then Caid Moham med knew whom he had thus treated, and trembled. The Sultan said, \" The arm that struck me, and the leg that kicked me, are mine : cut them off.\" The baker now said to himself, \" If he has taken the leg and the arm off the caid, he will surely take my head,\" so he fell down upon the earth, and implored the Sultan to have mercy upon him.

He again announced the destruction of that country by the Chaldeans, which he typified by burying the stones over which the throne of Nebuchadnezzar was to be raised. On the invasion of Egypt by the Chaldeans, the Jews would naturally have fled a second time. It was from the \"north country\" that fear was coming. * \" When ye shall enter into Egypt, ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach, and ye shall see this place no more.\" Jeremiah xiii. 1 8."], [759, "FLED INTO BARBARY. 271 They must have fled towards the west. The prophet had announced that they were not to see the land of their fathers again ; and the Jewish peasants inha biting Mount Atlas, at a distance of two thousand four hundred years, tell us, that they left Jerusalem before the Babylonish captivity. While this is a remarkable confirmation of the accuracy of the Jewish records, and of the fulfilment of a prophecy the accomplishment of which had not been recorded, it gives at the same time to the traditions of these people the weight and force of historical record. One of their traditions is, that Nebuchadnezzar in vaded Spain, attacked the Tyrians at Cadiz, and carried with him in his armies many Jews to Spain, who were afterwards colonized in these countries. This account has hitherto been disregarded because there is no historical evidence for it. The tradition is, however, confirmed by the name of the ancient capital, Toledo \u2014 Toledoth, or the generations with Ascalon, so often repeated in the names of old Spanish cities, Jaffa, and the others enumerated by Mariana. The translator of Al Makhari mentioned to me the discovery at Toledo of an old manuscript, in Jewish character, but not Hebrew, and which he supposed to be a sign of the Jews, who had settled in Spain previous to the Carthaginian conquest, having adopted the original language of Spain, as their successors have the Spanish.

The Barbary Jews all profess themselves to be of the tribe of Benjamin. When I asked the Jew, how a tribe almost extinguished, and the least of the tribes of Israel, should, to the exclusion of all the rest, have supplied the whole of the Jewish population now in the west, he answered by referring to the promise to the seed of Benjamin, and, as if inwardly recurring to the other promise to the tribe of Judah, he added, \"But we are also of the tribe of Judah, and the two are mixed together.\" It immediately occurred to me, that they made a point of asserting the tribe of Judah still to exist, as preserving the future application of the prophecy regarding the Messiah, and that they brought in the kingdom of Judah, and the two tribes of which it was composed, as the source from which they sprang, and that thence arose the habit of speak ing of the ten tribes as being lost. There can be no doubt that the successive emigrations to Spain and to Barbary while the two kingdoms still remained distinct, were composed of all the tribes, but in the loss of their several inheritances and separate govern ments, they had become confounded in their new settlements. When this Jew was asserting his descent from Judah, it occurred to me to ask him to say shibboleth. He was confounded, but attempted again and again, and could not accomplish it. He was very angry.

When I learnt the destruction of Widnoon, and the other devastations of the wandering Arabs, I could not help reflecting \u2014 and I made the remark to my companions \u2014 that the province of Sus was what Canaan must have been in the time of Joshua, in respect to its numerous walled towns, the fertility of its soil, and several other respects ; and that the eruptions of the Arabs of the Desert resembled much the conduct of the ancient Israelites when they came out of the Desert into the cultivated country.\" VOL. II. T"], [762, "274 FROM ARZELA CHAPTER V. TANGIER. From Arzela to Tangier there are two roads, one by the interior and one by the beach. Not far from the former are the Druidical remains. I, however, preferred the shore-road, not to lose the sight of that splendid tumult of waters. We started a little before full-tide. Here there were no cliffs or rocks along the beach, but flat, open, sand ; and in advance of the shore, at about a quarter of a mile, there was generally a bank, along which I walked the greater part of the day barefoot, having now and then to fly before the sudden sweep of a larger wave. I learnt the difference between walking with the foot that God had given us, and stumping in the cases constructed by man. Nothing could be more beautiful than the bank of foam sea ward. The waves began breaking about a mile off, and there were generally three permanent cataracts, stretching as far as I could see, this way and that, but at times I could count seven or eight successive lines of surf, which, constantly rolling, appeared nevertheless permanent waterfalls : beyond, the sea was smooth, calm, and there was no wind. This was the coast in its mildest mood, and under its most favourable"], [763, "TO TANGIER. 275 aspect. In the middle of the day the ' sea-breeze came in at about ten knots an hour, and swept before it with each wave sheets of foam, radiating with prismatic colours. The coast is strewed with frag ments of ships and bones of sharks. The Arabs will sometimes burn large masses of timber merely to get the nails that may be in them. To the south it often happens that whales are wrecked on the coast. Within about five miles of Cape Spartel, I observed one of the most beautiful effects of the pattern figures of the sand, and I mention it as being within the reach of a ride from Tangier. There appeared to be a stream rising along the ground : it was the fine sand carried inland by the wind ; and in this neighbour hood it has since been observed to me by persons who had themselves marked the change, that the sand was gaining upon the cultivated land. It is this, I imagine, that has led to the belief prevalent amongst the Europeans in this country, that the sand along the coast of Morocco has been thrown up by the sea ; but the sand thus carried inward is but dust in the balance compared with that enormous stratum which constitutes the maritime border of the country, and which is battened down by a skin of rock. The edges of this mass of sand are worn by the waters, and a slight portion is blown inwards by the wind ; but the mass itself has been the load of an ocean, and carried to where it now rests, from the interior of Africa itself. I may here mention the caves of Cape Spartel, which I subsequently visited. A couple of miles southward T 2"], [764, "276 THE CAVES OF CAPE SPARTEL. of the Cape there is a flat, projecting rock, about sixty feet high : it is composed of a hard and porous conglomerate, which forms excellent mill-stones ; and it seems to have been used from all antiquity for that \u25a0Qurpose. The summit bears towards the land the remains of Ph\u0153nician walls ; the rock is in all direc tions burrowed for the mill-stones ; they are cut about two and a half feet in diameter. They chisel them all round ; then break off the part with wedges ; and this scooping out has a most singular effect. The rock is so hard that parts are left standing only a few inches thick, and, like open trellis-work, over which you may scramble. Forty feet above the surf, and projecting over it, there are two large caves open to the sea, into which the waves dash with fury. These, though greatly extended by the scooping for the millstones, were natural caverns, and no doubt one of them must have been the cave of Hercules. Even within the last few years a considerable portion of the rock has fallen away. There is in one a dome, with a circular aperture in the centre. The rock is all pierced through like a large warren : it contains cavities filled up with sand and bones, like the Kirkdale caves of Yorkshire. It was dark when we reached Tangier : the gate of the city was already closed, though I had sent one of the soldiers in advance. The gate of the citadel was, however, opened for our admission. On issuing from the gate of the fortress, we came in sight of the city below us, shining like a congregation of glowworms. There was not a light to be seen \u2014 yet all was light,"], [765, "ARRIVAL AT TANGIER. 277 shaded, mellowed, and phosphoric. There were here no lamp-posts in the streets, and no windows in the houses, through which their lights could be seen : the white walls of the interior courts were illuminated with a blue reflected light, which produced an optical delusion ; from the want of a direct ray to measure the distance, the lighted surfaces seemed remote, and the town swelled into magnificence of proportion. It was, indeed, but for a moment, for the sun soon corrected the error of the eye. I reached the door of Miss Duncan, who renders Tangier habitable for Europeans, in such a condition that, when it was opened and light brought, it was about to be closed against me as a mad santon, my scanty habiliments, a shirt and drawers, being torn with briars and disfigured with mud, while the arms and legs fared no better. Great was the surprise when from such a body proceeded an English appeal for shelter, and within an hour I was seated on a chair at a table, before a fire of sea-coal, with grate, fender, and fire-irons. On the table stood cruet-stand, knife and fork, Staffordshire plates, and Scotch broth.

The difficulties, from the season of the year, were, however, the charm of the trip ; the weather was mild and beautiful, but the roads \u2014 if they can be so called \u2014 were heavy and deep. This, comparatively"], [766, "278 MIXED POPULATION OF TANGIER. speaking, would have mattered little, if we had been well mounted ; our animals were, I think, the worst I ever journeyed with, and the charge the most exorbitant I ever paid. I could have bought them outright for one third more than the sum I gave for the week's hire. The charges for the soldiers were in proportion, and I found that this journey had cost me in time and in money, the same as posting from Calais to Naples. Each soldier received for his week's journey, the price of an ox. Coming from the south, Tangier was a very different object than when I crossed the Straits to visit it, as a specimen of Barbary. In fact, it is a place equally foreign to both. The Moors designate it, \" Infidel,\" like the Giaour of the Turks. It is the only place where Europeans reside, and there is here a mixture of all classes, Brebers, Moors, Jews, and Europeans, living promiscuously together. On the cession of the place by the English, it be came the property of the Sultan, who offered it to the Brebers, thinking by that means to fix them in the towns. Some hundred families accepted the offer, but their example has not been followed by the rest. They seem originally to have enjoyed a very free government, by their own municipal body, which consisted of twelve, and who each in turn was gover nor of the city for a month. The fortifications present a strange jumble of the structure of all ages, but the only chiselled remains that I saw were Roman, being capitals, and shafts of Corinthian columns."], [767, "DESCRIPTION OF THE TOWN. 279 The town stands on a deep mass of the relics of former habitations. The Danish consulate has recently been rebuilt, and in some places they dug twenty feet below the present level. Twelve feet below the surface there were found Roman tombs, and eight feet below these, round black jars containing frag ments of burnt bones similar to those which have been found in mounds in Denmark. I could see none of them, as they had been all sent to Denmark to the king. A portion of a fine Roman bridge still stands, leading from Tangier across the river, in the direction of the northern coast. It resembles the Flavian bridge at Rome, and is fifteen feet broad between the parapets : an old engraving of the city, when in possession of the English, represents the port crowded with vessels. It was in form nearly triangular, the apex being at the entrance three hun dred and fifty fathoms from the base. Two moles were run out, one protecting it from the north-east, the other from the north-west : these were destroyed when we surrendered the place. From here you command a perfect view through the Straits. It is impossible not to be struck with its superiority over Gibraltar, while the moles existed. Here you are to windward : with easterly winds you may work through with the current's aid, and with westerly winds you are far enough out of its draught to be able to get away to the westward. There is, how ever, a position close by, which is superior to it. It is a cove two miles to the westward, and at the point"], [768, "THE PORT OF TANGIER. 280 of the cape. It would require, indeed, some clear ance out of the sand, and the addition of a break water at each of the horns : there is good anchorage before it, and nothing more to be feared than from the north. The coast of Spain terminating at Trafalgar breaks the sea from the north, and the northerly wind never blows home, as the various influences of the Straits change it here either into an east or a west wind. The Americans some years ago cast their eyes on this position, and wished to obtain it as their Mediterranean emporium, and they offered a large sum of money for it to the Government of Morocco. Above this cove is situated a house that has been constructed by an English gentleman. It had been several months untenanted, and though there is a road passing close behind it, nothing had been touched. There was on the steps of the door a child's toy \u2014 a cart \u2014 just as it had been left weeks before ; some of the panes of glass were broken, but this had been done by the pigeons. Garden implements were lying about. During two years that the proprietor has resided there, he had locked nothing up, and lost nothing. There are in the neighbourhood several villages, and no stipendiary magistrate, or rural police. There is here a restricted but agreeable society of the foreign agents, and a most imposing assem blage of flag-staffs\u2014 or rather masts\u2014 which are struck and housed in bad weather, and which exhibit fore"], [769, "CONSULS' HOUSES AT TANGIER. 281 and back stays, cross-trees, rigging, rattlings, halyards, &c, giving to the flat roofs of their * habitations the appearance of decks, and making them look like so many vessels, wanting only their yards to be crossed, and their sails to be bent. In their nautical pretensions, they are, however, beaten by the English consul at Cadiz, who hoists a pendant, and whose porter pipes a guest up the stairs with a boatswain's call. Amidst the consular masts with their floating stand ards and streaming pendants, which make the town look from without rather like a dockyard than a city, there is not one that bears the blue cross of St. An drew. There was the agent of the young republic of the West at work trying to involve France and Morocco with a view to the settlement of the Oregon question against England, while the profound cabinet of the North is so heedless of Morocco as not to have even a consul there. Nay, Russia is positively so ignorant of the commonest facts connected with this country, that, when appealed to recently in an affair concerning it, she replied that she considered it as a portion of Turkey. The circumstances attending the appointment of the present American consul are curious. He had been consul here formerly, and on no good terms with the authorities. The Moors are very particular in seeing to whoever embarks from this place, and the foreign agents, of course, always give previous notice of their intention. The American consul on taking"], [770, "282 CONDUCT OF THE his departure, not only gave no such notice, but an nounced his intention of not doing so. The Pacha, therefore, sent orders to the Porte to prevent the em barkation of any one without permission.

An infraction of the law of nations in his inviolable per son, &c. \u2014 protest, commotion\u2014 the learned consular body sign \u2014 all nations, all Christendom was attacked \u2014 and the farce would have been enough for a war, had it occurred in Turkey or Mexico. The United States had, however, as yet no mission of civilization in Mo rocco, and took no notice of the affair ; but, upon the accession of Mr. Polk, the bearing of Morocco upon England and France was to have been recon sidered, and the discarded consul sent back without any previous settlement of the quarrel. When the news reached Morocco, the government was greatly troubled, and after enlisting the good services of the French agent, transmitted a statement of the case to the government of the United States, waving the right of the Emperor to refuse to admit their agent, and leav ing it for the American government to judge whether such a person was fit to be the channel of intercourse between two friendly governments ; and this repre sentation was to be backed by the French minister at Washington. In the meantime, Mr. Carr arrived at Gibraltar. The Moorish government resolved to say to him, that they would receive him as a private person,"], [771, "AMERICAN CONSUL AT TANGIER. 283 but could not admit him as consul, as they had sub mitted the case to his government. But the part had been rehearsed also on the other side, and to better purpose. Mr. Carr came with two frigates. On the Pacha's making his concerted speech, he was answered by the naval commander : \" I don't know anything about the matter. I have orders to bring here the consul of the United States ; will you re ceive him or not, yes or no \\ \" on which the caid said, that he was ready to receive him, if the naval officer would give him a paper, saying that he con strained him to do so. This was the same functionary who had negotiated with the French, under the threat of having a pistol ball through his head, and signed the treaty of Tangier without ever having read it ; this is the person, in whose hands are placed the foreign relations of Morocco ; who has property transferred to France, and who is openly charged with giving bribes to foreign agents, and receiving bribes from foreign governments. There is a beautiful walk from the upper part of Tangier, along the crest of the hill to the cove, so coveted by the Americans. It retains the name it had when the English were here, of Marchand ; the boys appropriate it for a game which is evidently the origin of billiards; it is played with two balls of iron, and a ring, which just admits them. The object is to pocket the ball through the ring ; they play several on a side. Instead of cues they use a piece of wood, of the form of the old sacrificial"], [772, "284 CH1LDRENS' PASTIMES IN MOROCCO. knife, with which they impel the ball by a sweeping motion, drawing its edge along the ground. The ball is called bola, the ring Arabi. This game flourishes particularly at Tangier, where the boy population has profited by the liberal distribu tion of grape made by the French. The children in Morocco are distinguished for their games ; \u2014 I have seen leap-frog performed in a manner which would not have disgraced an English clown in a panto mime. They are dexterous in the use of the single stick, and they have a mimic imitation of the powder game of the men, which resembles the French game called barre. They have blindman's buff, and hunt the slipper, which must be Moorish ; and hunt the slipper and blindman's buff are combined in one, for they must strike the ground with a slipper, and having done so, must not leave the spot if the blinded man approaches them. At the entrance of all the towns we found, it being holiday time, whirligigs. No inconsiderable portion of Moorish art is expended on toys : there are drums of pottery- ware, a tube covered with parchment at one end, with the other open, such as were used amongst the Jews, and may be detected among the Egyptians. The habits of children are not to be neglected in the history of nations, for they are a primitive and original community transmitting their manners to their successors, distinct from the nation of adults, and flowing as a pure source into the turbid stream, and age after age struggling against it."], [773, "285 PECULIARITIES OF MOROCCO. I must enumerate the peculiarities of this land before quitting it, although, indeed, every thing that exists in it is a peculiarity ; for when they do things like other people, they have no more taken it from them than one man borrows from another the way to breathe. They have a form of room, tesselated and open court, vermilioned and cedar beams, lofty arch and thick-set column conjoined, carving of wood, fretting of walls, colouring in patterns and assortment of colours, doors, windows, brackets, stables, kitchens, store-houses, water-closets, and tomb-stones, \u2014 all un like what is to be seen east or west, north or south. They have carpets like other people, but in their own style ; they have mats, but the figure is Moorish ; they have caps, the form is their own ; they have shoes, again, as unlike Eastern slippers as European boots ; they have towels (our name comes from them) but they are unlike ours ; so they have pottery, em broidery, and even the use of the needle. Using the same letters as the Persians and the Turks, the Moors have an entirely distinct set of their own instruments of penmanship. They have one national dish. Un like any thing else that is practised amongst men, so is their costume. It is a nation living under tents, and yet excelling all others in the composition of mate rials for fortresses and the structure of gigantic walls.

What is chiefly remarkable, is the absence of all things that are not in taste. There is no repetition of chintz patterns used for adornments of wall or floor ; there is no glazed or glaring oil paint ; there are no pictures or prints hung for ornament sake ; no gilt and gaudy frames round these unsuited to the apartments in which they are placed. Upon their persons there are no repetitions of figures, no inter minable variety of tints, and no false ones. Some centuries ago, I might have increased the list of the peculiarities of Morocco, such as the use of candles for giving light ; of bells to call servants ; of knockers to announce visitors ; of straw hats to shade off the sun ; of a different sort of meal in the morning and in the evening; tambourine and crochet work and lace, to occupy ladies' fingers or adorn their persons ; of patches for their cheeks ; of that beautiful leather of various colours known by this country's name, of inlaid leathern patterns ; of vases of ancient figure. The Moors, with the art requisite to produce works admirable and exquisite, are in the rudest stage of early craft, and have no less avoided adopting from us any process or any improvement than they have been careful to exclude our corruptions of style and manners. They have not got our plough or our"], [775, "PECULIARITIES OF MOROCCO. 287 wheel, or our roads, or even the common pump : they have not got a turning lathe or a shuttle ; though they have Morocco leather, they have no tanning vats ; they make the most exquisite silks without a throw ing machine ; and with the most admirable woollens they know not the manufacture of cloth. They have never drawn the metals from their rich mines ; they still preserve the incantations and divinations of the earliest times; they have perfumes and incense, secrets and mysteries, yet in use in every house. Their mala dies are their own \u2014 elephantiasis and biblical leprosy ; the travelling scourge of plague visits them not, and yet they have a plague of their own. And, finally, they have an intoxicating drug differing from all other people ; they have neither recourse to wine, spirits, nor opium ; they have a plant, the produce of their own country, presenting to them, when so dis posed, delusions and forgetfulness. Their permanency \u2014 as their peculiarities \u2014 may be compared to, but exceed, those of China. The Tartars are masters of Chinese, amounting in numbers to half the human race, to whom they have not given their religion ; the same Tartars have not been able to subjugate fifteen millions of Moors, of the same religion.

The whole neighbourhood is full of similar circles of stones, but smaller : many of the latter have been worked artificially. The entrance to the circle, which is fifteen feet wide, faces the west ; on the north and south of the Peg are two openings at equal distances. At about the distance of two hundred feet, there is a stone placed at an angle of 45\u00b0, intending, it is said, to mark the opening ; it is six feet high, and by lying on the back, one can see directly through the circle.\" Discoveries of a similar kind have been made in VOL.

Had the cromlechs and Druidical circles belonged to the original races of Africa, they would surely be found in more than two parts of its surface. The other explanation is not so easily disposed of, as it involves no less intricate a question than the ancient peopling of the peninsula. It is, that Spain and the West were inhabited by Celts. Three theories have been advanced respecting the early races of Spain. First, that it was colonized from Jud\u00e6a.

The feat of reducing the populations of Europe, Celts, Slavs, Basques, and Goths, to one denomination, has been accomplished just at the time that a hitherto unheard-of hatred and repulsion has been engendered between races, threatening society with convulsions as lamentable in their results as in their causes. They are fantastic and absurd, and the age most versed in the knowledge of the events of other times, exhibits itself as the least capable of any that has ever existed, for managing the affairs of its own. In all other investigations of a similar description, the point of departure is a known language; here it is an assumed one, just as if, at a future time, out of some remnants of English, preserved in Yorkshire, and some Celtic names in Wales, a British language were to be constructed. The same fallacy has equally pervaded the three theories. The assertors of the several origins have each commenced by assuming one people. Each has indubitable proofs in hand, as to the existence of his people, but each will extirpate the others, and so present vulnerable points to his antagonist. Larramendi sees nothing in Spain that is not Basque ; Risco nothing that is not Celtic'; Mariana nothing that is not Hebrew ; and each is justly ridiculous in the eyes of his opponent. In the opening of any field, whether of modern"], [782, "294 THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF SPAIN discovery or of ancient research, we commence by assuming as many people as we find names, and only on proof do we admit that two or more belong to one tribe or race. Proceeding by this simple method, and applying to Spain the rule undeviatingly adopted everywhere else, the ancient population will present no difficulty. We hear of Hispani, of Iberi, of Keltoi ; unquestionably, then, there were three races distinct in their tongue, time, and habitation. Each of the theories would annihilate two of these to establish the third. As soon as we accept the names handed doum, the theories fall to the ground.

The Basques have lived through the my thology of Greece, the wars of Carthage, the dominion of Rome, the devastations of the Vandals, the sway of the Goths, the arms of the Moors, the usurpations of Madrid, and the opinions of Europe, keeping them selves all the while distinct, and recollecting them selves alone.

The Noraghi, and the \" Sepul chres of the Giants,\" in Sardinia, are no less distinct from any known architecture than is the Biscayan from any known tongue. That the Basques were a great people is proved by their names being spread all over the Peninsula, even to the sea-board or limit, which in the Basque furnishes the etymon of the word, Spain, f That they inherited the southern shores and were a sea- * Thucyd. 1. viii. ; Dion.

The Iberi had so identified themselves with the Romans, that the Latin became the common tongue.

Does not this confirm the inference, which is inevitable from the names of Etruscan co lonies in Spain, that the Iberi and the people of Latium were of the same race 1 Thus also do we find the Latian rights conferred on cities in Spain, while no such favour was accorded to Sicily or Greece, to Macedon or Britain. It may be traced wherever the Etruscan colonies extended. If, then, the Basque has survived, it is because there were two languages in Spain, and spoken by people whose character was as different as their tongues. The Basques still retain a method of culture which is neither the plough nor the spade. An instrument like a prong is used, each of the labourers having two : they work in gangs, and turn over the soil with one-half the labour that is requisite for spade culture. These prongs are called laias ; \u2014 they are as peculiar to the people as their tongue. I have elsewhere pointed out the distinction be tween the two races in respect to the use of butter, and the names connected with the dairy; the use of"], [791, "THE BASQUE LANGUAGE. 303 tapia for building, and the ancient armour. In these matters of the first importance \u2014 agriculture, food, building, and warfare \u2014 there is a clear line drawn between the Hispani and Iberi. The Greeks and the Romans were not philologists, neither were they ethnographists. In no classical writer is the consanguinity of the Iberians and Nu midians asserted. We have to come down to the Fathers of the Church to learn, by statement, that the Hebrew and Ph\u0153nician, that these and the Arabic were sister-tongues. When the Romans became ac quainted with Spain, a period of time had elapsed from the first settlement of the Iberians, equal to that from Alfred to our days, and the Basques or Eskora had been cooped up in the north-east. It is the least likely of all things that they should have been noticed by the Romans as a distinct, or have been suspected to be an original people. Nor can we wonder at such an oversight at that time, when the same thing has occurred in modern Spain. Learned men have been writing profound disquisitions on the origin of the Spanish language, and compiling lexicons and etymologies without the slightest reference to the existing people of Biscay. The same thing may be said of St. Isidore, Antonio De Nabrissa, P. Guadix, Diego de Urrea, &c. A stranger a century ago would have found in the phi lologists of modern Spain no more notice of the ex istence of the Basque, than of the Chinese language, although at the same time the Basque writers were"], [792, "304 THE HISPANI AND IBERI. enumerating nearly two thousand Basque words in the Spanish dictionary. The strangeness of Iberian words to Roman ears confirms this view. Volsci, Suessa, Cere, Roma could not be strange to them. It could only be some of the names that were so \u2014 that is, the names of places* that had remained from the early occupation of the Basques. To us, Hispani and Iberi, Hispania and Iberia, mean the same thing. They belong to two people, and are terms of a different order : the one is the name of a country applied to a people, the other the patronymic of a tribe applied to a country. You have in Africa the name Garb in general use for the country, and for the people Moslemin. No other words are known there, and our terms for their country would be as unintelligible to them as theirs are to us. Now sup pose that a conqueror occupied Morocco, ignorant and contemptuous of foreign tongues : hearing \"Garb,\" and \" Moslemin,\" he would, adding his own termina- * Nos Celtis genitos et ex Iberis, Gratos non pudeat referre versu, Nostr\u0153 nomina duriora terr\u0153.

Not knowing Celtic or Iberian, he made a mistake, which the following lines explain : \u2014 Rides nomina 1 Rideas licebit H\u00e6c tarn rustica, delicate lector, H\u00e6c tarn rustica malo, quam Britannos. \" Cantabrorum aliquot populi amnesque sunt, quorum nomina nostro ore concipi nequeant.\" Pomp. Mela, 1. iii. c. 2."], [793, "305 THE NAME \" IBERIA.\" tion, take these words as the general names for the country, and we should have Morocco called \" Garbia\" or \"Mosleminia\" (to make the analogy complete we must suppose Moslemin to apply to a tribe, not to a faith). If then, after fifteen centuries, and when the people had undergone great vicissitudes, philosophers should arise to investigate, they might be nonplused by these two fictitious terms, and could not possibly see their way until they had discovered that Garb was a geographical, and Moslemin a tribe name, and that the ignorant conquerors had not only mistaken the value of these terms, but had made each general, and had simultaneously employed both. One nation may govern another as well under a wrong as a right name, and, perhaps, much better ; but it does not fol low that a philologist will indifferently well theorize under the like mistake. Now, what I have supposed is exactly what has happened. A sentence of Strabo tells the whole story : \u2014 \" The Spania?'ds restrict the name of Iberia to the part within the Iber ; the Romans call the whole country Iberia, dividing it into hither and thither Spain? which is equivalent to calling Great Britain \" Scotland,\" and then dividing it into \" England on this and on that side the Tweed.\" * Having thus ascertained the existence of Hispani and Iberi, the Celts present no difficulty, \u2014 they are neither the one nor the other ; and if it were requi site to establish still more distinctly the originality of * L. iii. c. 2.

They represent two people wholly different ;\u2014 there is not one line of the picture of the one applicable to the other. The Iberi were a quiet inoffensive race ; the Gauls a warlike and a restless people. The Iberi began to feel their strength \" only after they were subjugated ;\" the Gauls were subjugated in consequence of their overweening confidence in their own strength. The Iberi gave weapons to the Romans; the Gauls learned from the Romans the art of war. The Iberi had short, well-tempered swords which they used with remarkable agility ; the Gauls, long, unwieldy swords, which turned and bent with their own blow. The Gauls had their Druids. The Iberian temples \u2014 those of Hercules \u2014 were venerable structures when the Carthaginians approached the walls of Saguntum, the Romans those of Numantia. The Gauls and Iberians acknowledged no kindred with each other. The Gauls claimed no blood-relationship, like the Iberians, with Rome or Carthage. The Gauls were never called Iberians, nor the Iberians Gauls ; and the Romans, familiar as they were with the Gauls in Italy, when they first invaded Spain, would certainly have called its inhabitants by that name had they belonged to that race. If the Iberians had been Celts, there would"], [795, "307 THE GAULS. be Druidical remains, and some record of the last stand of the Druids, as in England and Gaul. At the period of the foundation of Rome, the word Gaul might be considered synonymous with European. The Gauls had flowed from the eastward like an in undation ; the middle regions of Europe, which they filled, became insufficient for them ; they passed into Britain ; they descended upon Greece ; and they crossed the Bosphorus. Their adventurous spirit was not arrested by the Alps, nor their courage daunted by the martial bearing and concentrated power of the lordly people who then flourished in the peninsula. They were not, however, able to overrun Italy, though they colonized many parts, re maining a distinct people. They never crossed the Pyrenees ; the Vascones and Aquitani spread even in advance of that barrier far into Gaul.* The Gallic emigration was arrested there by those already in possession, whether Hispani or Iberi, who were able> by the confe,ssion of the Romans, to contend with them after the fall of Carthage for the mastery of the world. But the name of the Gauls is found in the Penin sula.

I consequently opened it with extreme curiosity, to find by what arrange ment of data, or what sophistry of argument, he could arrive at such a conclusion. Great was my surprise to find no conclusion whatever arrived at, and ex treme care taken to avoid appearing to express an opinion.

All he says is interesting ; there is nothing which controverts the view opened out in the foregoing pages, and much that adds strength to it. Starting from the point above-mentioned, he pro ceeds to find, for every name recorded in ancient writers, a word in Basque by which to explain it.

I perceived the intercourse of the two people in their baking and cooking, dairy, dress, ornaments, superstition and words. If this connexion were with the Celts in general, it would be a matter of mere ethnography, but it is one of history, for the coinci dences are with the clans alone. The kirtle, plaid, bonnet, eagle's plume, family cognisances are unknown in Brittany ; nor do the Bretons call their farm-steads, gabhail, or their grey hounds, sloghie. The dress of the clans is not that of the ancient Gauls : those who advocate its an tiquity are much puzzled to find a source for it, and content themselves with supposing it to be derived from the Roman. No supposition can be more groundless : that branch of the Celts which never did submit to Roman domination could not be the only one to adopt the Roman dress.* The Scots, * Some of them took service, but not before the fourth cen- tury."], [801, "RESEARCHES OF MR.

Mr. Layard's researches above, as well as under ground, have furnished further evidence in many points of resemblance between their manners and the scenes carved on the alabasters of the Assyrians, and the customs preserved by the mountain-tribes in the neighbourhood. The clans crowned their king on a stone, and threw down their plaids before him.

The name of fairies in Erse is shechyan, the Arab sheik. Moore remarks, that these beings seem to record some lost class or people, which he supposes to be the Druids.

The Scots, though Gauls, were a distinct and a military body, and they entered at a sub sequent time from a different direction.

These arts could not have been furnished by the Nomade tribes of Arabia Petrea ; and they were to be looked for in the descendants of that people, who for four centuries had made their country the granary of Rome and the world, who inherited the agricultural science, which had aided Carthage to extend her dominion.

After the Conquest of Gran ada, these Moors were obliged to send every year a certain number, to take part in the honours paid to St. Ferdinand on the 30th of May ; and they had to assist at the Vigils and Mass, in capuzes, with green caperotes, with their crescents also green, and they stood round the tumulus with white torches burning in their hands. The Moreria existed down to 1502, when, by an order of the Catholic king, all the Moors, inhabitants of Seville, were expelled the kingdom, which order and the mode of execution are sufficiently curious to be published here, as they have not been given by any author. \" The King and the Queen. \u2014 D.

There is the stamp of that fierce border war of many centuries. It is, besides, a perfect study of military architecture. There may be seen double tiers of guns, as on the broadside of a ship, the lower embrasure no wider than the muzzle, having a slit above, in the form of a cross, to aim by. There is also outside the walls, and all round, as at Gibraltar and Malaga, an advanced work, on which guns were mounted, at once multiplying the means of annoyance and protecting the base of the walls from the enemy's shot. This place has three distinct internal defences, with deep ditches traversing them. It seemed all hollowed out ; cisterns or mattamores for corn occupy the centre. Close to one of the walls, and at a part where the ground is low, there is a large square opening, which must even now be fifty feet deep, though a great quantity of rubbish has fallen in. A solitary tower at the opposite point from the village projects beyond the circuit of walls : the stories of halls or vaults, with large embrasures or windows in the three sides, combine the light and airy prospect of a kiosk, with the gloomy grandeur of a fortress. There the traveller that would muse should go, and go alone, and ponder long.

During the siege, the Moors proposed to pull it down, as too sacred to be left ; but were prevented by the threat of St. Ferdinand, that if they touched one stone, or rather brick, of it, he would not leave one man alive. The singular name that belongs to it, is brought forth deep from the Sevillian's breast, and its tones linger on his lips. It rivals the Imma culate Conception as an emblem and an ornament ; it is seen in the painted windows of the churches and cathedrals ; it is embossed on the chairs, embroidered on the dresses ; prints of it are suspended on the walls ; it is to be found in the pictures of the altar pieces and the slabs of the pavement; it is copied in the steeples of the surrounding towns ; and, finally, it has given to Seville her two patron saints.

This event is the subject of one of the most incongruous, though not the least beautiful, of the pictures of Murillo. This tower claims for its architect the supposed in ventor of Algebra, and it was raised by one of the most powerful of monarchs, Jacob the Second, of the Almohades. It has been spared alike by the Van dalism and fanaticism of conquest, the ravages of war, the lightning that hath struck, and the earthquakes that have shattered the humbler edifices around. It is the embellishment of Seville ; her pride, her standard-bearer, her nightly watch-tower, the plume of her mural coronet, first caught by the eye of the stranger, and last seen. The Giralda is said to be superior to the towers of Rabat and Morocco ; but there is no comparison either in the materials, the ornaments, or dimensions. On reaching the gallery, the clangour of bells strikes one, as replacing the Muezzin call, \" God is great. To prayers.\" \" Prayer is better than sleep.\" There are a dozen great bells, which send forth the most discordant and unceasing peals, and the ringing of them is a strange exhibition. They are swung round and round ; the rope is allowed to coil itself round the stock, or is jerked on the lip of the bell, and the ringer springs up by stanchions in the wall to get a purchase, and then throws himself down ; or he allows himself to be carried by the rope as it swings round outside. As I entered the gallery, I saw one of the"], [832, "344 VIEW FROM THE GIRALDA. ringers thrown out, as I imagined, and expected, of course, that he was dashed on the pavement below ; I saw him the next moment perched on the bell, smiling at my terror. The belfry does, however, discharge as a steeple, several of the functions to which it was appropriated as a minaret : the day, as in Mussulman countries, is divided by prayer. When you ask in Morocco, at what hour you are to arrive at such a place; \u2014 if they mean at sunset, they will answer, \"at Assar.\" So other hours are marked by the first prayer, or the mid-day prayer, and this is made known to all, not only by the muezzin's call, but also by a flag hoisted on the minaret, \u2014 called alem. The Spaniards, in like man ner, divide the time by the prayers, the oracion, the animas, &c, the period of which is announced gene rally, in the south of Spain, from the towers that the Musselmans built for the same purpose. The view from the Giralda invited me to ascend it daily during my stay. Whether it was calm or windy, whether in sunshine or shade, the charm was the same in its diversities : the lightness of the atmo sphere in every change, justified the saying of the Sevillians, \" Our climate is fit to raise the dead.

HOSPITAL DE LA SANGRE. This is a noble edifice, composed of several grand courts and of two stories, the lower one for summer, and the upper one for winter. I think I may say that to each patient is allotted at least four times as much space as in any similar European establishment, and the very troughs in which the dirty linen is washed are marble : the patients have two changes of clean linen in the week. The kitchens are all resplendent with painted tiles and cleanliness, and there seemed abund ance of excellent food. In these institutions, in Spain, the inmates are completely at home. Soft and bloom ing girls, with downcast look and hurried step, were attending upon the poor, the maimed, and the suffer ing. The Lady-Directress had told the servant who accompanied me, to bring me, after my visit, to her apartment, which was a hall in one of the corners of the building : she said she had heard that England was celebrated for its charity, and asked if our poor and sick were better off than in Spain. I was obliged to confess that the reverse was the case. She was, however, better informed than I at first suspected. Tarshish, or the earliest settlement in the West, says, \" as it was not likely that these traders should have ventured so far inland.\""], [834, "346 THE CARTUJA She asked me if it was not true that we hired merce naries to attend on the sick and abstained from per forming that duty ourselves ; and if our charity was not imposed as a tax % She told me that there were eight hundred of her order in Spain ; that it was the only one that had not been destroyed ; that none were admitted but those of noble birth or of gentle blood ; and that they took all the vows except that of seclusion, and in lieu of it took that of service to the poor and sick.

Their costume was peculiarly well preserved ; and the work \u2014 itself cleanly \u2014 was carried on in the midst of noble structures, surrounded with the finest chiseling, the grandeur of vaults and the gorgeousness of azuleos. I inquired for the sepulchral stone of St. Hermangildo, and after some search, and the removal of a heap of stones, we found it let into the wall at the east end of the church.

I was anxious to get at the feelings of the people working in this sacred edifice. Although familiarity had destroyed any strong impressions, they all seemed to regret the splendour of their domicile, and ex pressed gratitude to their master for fitting up one of the chapels for public service. He himself told me that he had at first preserved the church of worship, but finding that it excited the congregation that the monastery should have been so disposed of, and have become the property of a heretic, he deemed it pru dent to exert his rights and convert the church to the uses of the manufactory. As they were drawing a distinction between the church and the monastery, he thought the time might come when they would reassert their claim to the possession of the monastery as well as to the church. If I had had no other occa sion to judge of the prospect of future tranquillity for Spain, this would have sufficed to assure me that, while this intrusion upon the monastic property en dures, no settlement will be made. In England and in France, church confiscation was accompanied with a change of belief, and those possessed either of here ditary influence or of political power were the acquirers.

The Cortes receives no petition upon the subject of church property, and the Crown listens to no prayers against the Cortes. The tithes never were supposed to be appropriated to the church by the State. The tithes in each spot had a special and chartered origin.* The church was the continuation of the Mozarabic worship, and was supported by obtubia and not by tithes. It was not the tenth but the twentieth part. The tithe was in fact legally fixed at five per cent, of the gross produce. From this tithe the clergy paid a revenue to the State of their annual cures and professions ; it amounted some years ago to 180,000,000 reals. The church now figures in the budget as a charge of 140,000,000 ; the difference amounts to one half the entire revenue of Spain, and the property itself has been wholly swallowed up. This country suffers at present only from the central government. The clergy, as a corporation, presents a check : the dues paid by the church would have been sufficient for all the purposes of government.

THE CATHEDRAL. This building has neither facade, spire, nor dome ; it gives no external signs of grandeur, is surrounded by no open space to exhibit its dimensions ; there is nothing to raise or satisfy expectation, \u2014 following the plan of the Mosque, which it has replaced, and which rose on the ruins of the Roman temple, its predecessor. The cathedral externally is lost in the mass of buildings which forms a parallelogram of 600 by 500 feet, across which it runs ; the remainder being made up of a parish church, a parterre of orange trees, the Giralda tower, the sacristy, and offices. As seen from a dis tance with its flat roof, it appears like a large house in a village ; for in the clearness of that sky distances are lost. When it is pointed out as the cathedral, any anticipations you may have indulged in are sobered down. The mind of the spectator is thus artfully managed, and the majesty of the building is veiled. Till you stand within its vaults \u2014 I entered not by its own portal, but by the parish church which opens into it \u2014 I thought I was in the cathedral, and looked"], [839, "THE CATHEDRAL OF SEVILLE. 351 around in surprise and disappointment. I presently perceived an opening, and wandering in the direction, I thought I was advancing up the nave \u2014 it was the width that was before me ! Now the tower-like pilas ters opened all around ; but the limit I could not see, for the view is intercepted by the built-up choir. There is no one point from which all is to be seen \u2014 you have the sense of the vastness of the whole wherever you look, but which is nowhere paraded for you to admire. You wander around to look for what is to be seen, \u2014 to find what is to be admired \u2014 as you would through a forest of trees. Raised upon the lines of a mosque and a temple, this building differs wholly from Gothic churches ; \u2014 there is no lengthened nave \u2014 no cross ; \u2014 it is a parallelogram supported by rows of pilasters, like the Temple of Phyle. The scantling of a church is only to be found in the distribution of the roof, ascending higher in the nave and transept, so as to make the cross. Six rows of pilasters traverse it in length, which sup port seven rows of roofs or vaults. The nave and tran sept are 120 feet in height ; the two aisles adjoining it on each side are 100 ; and the two outer aisles are lower, and divided into chapels. The centre vault above the high altar is 1 42 feet. At the eastern extremity it opens into the Lady Chapel, itself a spacious church ; while another, the sacristy, adjoining it to the south, is reached by a passage. The chapels conceal the altar and shroud the paintings, and their gratings seem to close in dens ; so that the edifice, excepting the choir,"], [840, "352 INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL. is as a cavern. The stone is without carving or monu ment ; there is no line save what belongs to the construction : \u2014 the pillars ascend, the arches join as if the rock had thus fashioned itself ; the only exception is the slight tracery of the balustrade of the triforium, and the fret-work of the graining of the central and adjoining vaults. But, contrasting with their grey dulness, the floor is in slabs of marble, alternately black and white in squares and lozenges. The chapels have their own windows. The body of the church has two clerestory rows, one in the nave, one in the second side-aisle above the chapels, be sides a Catherine wheel in each corresponding gable. They correspond : there is one to each vault \u2014 their lines are in perfect symmetry with the vaults and columns ; they are deeply coloured and furnished with curtains, by which the light is regulated, and, when requisite, the sun on the eastern and southern sides excluded. What we all feel regarding the \" manage ment\" of the light of a painting I now saw in an edifice. How improved its merits \u2014 how magnified its vastness \u2014 the effects of colossal magic lanterns played around ! Here presided the spirit of the Moors ; the gloom in which they delight ; the deep colour of the admitted rays, repeating the figures and tints of their gorgeous walls, and streaming with a sweet yet solemn beauty on their graceful ornaments. These last, indeed, were wanting, and their Sevillian pupils were determined to show what colour and the sun alone could do. As"], [841, "INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL. 353 he travels round, looking in from the different sides and windows, a thousand beauties reveal themselves with all the changes of breaking or departing day. Within this living rock of Gothic grandeur, one feels the nearest approach to the sublimity of the conception of the mosque, imitated by the Arab from the Desert, and the heavens between which his lot has been cast. The high altar has no gorgeous canopy, as in St. Peter's ; there are no gems, as in the chapel of the Medici ; neither mosaic nor painting nor gilding meet the eye ; \u2014 it is surrounded on the sides and in front by a lofty iron gilded grating, through which you can distin guish a screen filling up the width of the chancel, and rising seventy or eighty feet above the altar. This space is divided into compartments by four horizontal and five perpendicular lines, each of which contains a group of figures, in alto and basso relievo, diminishing as they ascend, the four figures coming fully out, and the accessories being traced in slight relief behind. Of these groups there are thirty-six, the principal figures two-thirds the size of life, and over each a Gothic canopy : they are separated by Gothic spaces, with niches and statues of various sizes. The cusps are enriched and enlivened with fine branches and foliage. Over the whole projects a cornice composed of the Twelve Apostles in niches, and the descent from the cross in the centre. These figures are the size of life. This cornice is a frame-work of Gothic niches for hold ing the statues, while branches are interlaced through its dentated spires and cusps.

Here would have been peculiar scope for the adaptation either of the Gothic pendants, or the Moorish stalactite. On the top, in the centre, is Christ on the cross, and the two Marys kneeling. These are a little larger than life. The groups contain between 300 and 400 figures. There are 200 small statues on the Gothic pinnacles dividing them ; seventeen statues the size of life are on the cornice and in the group above. The whole space, which is above 4000 square feet, is about equally divided between groups and statues, and tracery and foliation. The ornaments display the beau ties of the pointed Gothic style, with the richness of the Moresque white, serving as the frame-work to the exquisite Italian groupings. During three generations it passed from master to pupil, and from father to son, and the design was unbroken ; and, with the one exception I have mentioned, the whole is perfect as if it had been dreamt by a Cellini at night and executed in the morning. When you look upon it, you forget even the cathedral. I was able to get the great doors opened at the period when the cathedral is closed, and thus see the whole mass at once, and unimpeded.

But all these glimpses are nothing to be com pared to the unearthly effect of the setting-sun, when the light through the St. Catherine Wheel over the great door streams full upon its different shades. I was about to say that ten minutes on this spot, at this hour, is worth a journey to Seville ; but it is vain to rate the worth of what stands alone, and which fur nishes a new standard to rate the resources of art, the genius of man, and the beauty of nature. All are here combined within the majesty of a temple consecrated to the highest aims of life, and the hopes of eternity.

It was not white light, but deeply-coloured, and the distance from the window blended the tints, so that it came like a rainbow-cloud, and the groups passed through every variety of hue. The light shifted as it changed ; it moved, ascending always to other groups, and in the gloom they shone like visions in the sky.

The picture which faced me, as I entered, was Christ bending from the cross to embrace St. Felix, of Cantalicio \u2014 I might have taken it for Vandyke : next came a St. Joseph, equally admir able, yet different ; then a San Leandro \u2014 the one might have been from the pencil of Dominichino, the other of Titian ; and so I turned, from picture to picture, finding new rivals to every standard and style of excellence. The question then arose of com parison between the Spanish, the Italian, and Flemish schools. Afterwards, at Madrid, I visited repeatedly the Spanish collections, to possess myself thoroughly with them before visiting the Italian and Flemish galleries. A severer test I could not apply, for the gallery of the foreign schools, at Madrid, is the richest in the world. Here are the grander compositions of"], [850, "362 THE SPANISH SCHOOL Vandyke.

Amongst these is the cele- brated one of \" Fruitfulness ;\" a flock of cherubs, just as you may see chickens collected under an inverted basket in the streets of any Spanish town, and which, if anything, would eclipse or rival Murillo in the gracefulness and variety of his infantine conceptions. The result of the comparison was to relieve me from the restraint of habit, and I could, with conviction and boldness now assert, that in painting, Spain has no rival. The Spanish school is most various ; but in all its varieties it is natural. It has no particular manner : \u2014 manner is no more than systematic or constitutional failing.* It is the error to which a man is liable, and which, when he founds a system and instructs others, is more readily caught by his pupils than his merits, * \" The Spanish artists usually endeavoured to produce an exact imitation of material nature ; white the Italians aimed at, and attained higher results.

And so manner in paint ing either perverts or obscures nature. Nature, in her varieties, has a counterpart in the Spanish school. She is represented darkly in Ribera and Roelas, mildly in Cano, richly in Morales, boldly in Zurbaran, brightly in Velasquez, divinely in Murillo. The school of Spain is solemn. The subjects which were alone worthy to be immortalized, were those which pertained to immortality, and art was dignified no less in its application than its powers. Painting was a religious exercise. The enthusiasm of art was linked to fervour of faith. The studio was an oratory, and \"each work was commenced and prosecuted with fasting and prayer.\"* The lords were the convents ; the inmates were sons at once of the founder and of the peasant. For these Spanish art exercised her calling, not to please the caprice of a virtuoso, or to tapestry the walls of a Sybarite. Seville or Cordova presented no Flemish pot-houses. In the productions of their masters, there was none of the extravagant mythology of a Rubens, or the more finished lasciviousness of a Titian ; no dissecting-room of a Michael Angelo ; none of the finery of a Paolo Veronese. There were neither allegories, portraits, nor giants wrestling with the rocks.

The rea son is this ; that at Madrid are collected the paintings of Velasquez, who is so far Spanish only as the want of manner makes him so. Born in Seville, he became a Madrilefio, and a parasite. His pictures are all at the capital, and in the style suited to the taste of foreigners. The Spaniards of the capital esteem their painter, and are reacted upon by the estimation in which he is held by foreigners. The thought in all things comes before the exe cution. What would the work of him who chiselled the Apollo Belvidere have been, if applied to the person of a Souter Johnny i So the art of Velasquez was expended on Philips and abortions. His paint ings are common-place domestic scenes, or they are classical, and there he parodies the poets of Greece and travesties their gods. His chief works are beau tiful caricatures in oil, without satire and without fun. Before returning to Murillo and Seville, I must say a few words of his chief works. Vulcan's Forge is an exquisitely finished group of naked Spaniards, with arms, breasts, shoulders, and loins developed. They are heavy below, as if trampers, not blacksmiths ; nor have they been har dened and bronzed by exposure to the air, the furnace, or the sun : they have had their clothes taken off within the hour : the shirts must have been filthy;"], [853, "365 PAINTINGS BY VELASQUEZ. the bodies are unwashed. The picture is an exposure of nakedness. The walls of the place, and the man ners, and the countenances, would appear rather an effort to unidealize the Greek, than to raise the modern to a conception of ancient poetry. In it there is the genius of painting, not the painting of a man of genius. The Belidores. Drunkards ; or, Bacchus among his Companions. \u2014 These are Castilian peasants engaged in a most un-Spanish debauch. One naked, and bear ing a classic wreath, personates Bacchus, with a maudlin solemnity on a sensual countenance. An other presents a full face of coarse and stupid laugh ter, and wears on his head something between a Spaniard's sombrero and an Irish hat. This is the picture Wilkie selected from out the treasures of Madrid, to admire, to study, to imitate ; copying and recopying it, and so fixing in his own mind the phy siognomy of the laughing drunkard with the Irish hat, as thence to bring forth a numerous progeny, some times with a hat more, sometimes less, the worse for wear. The Spinners. A Flemish picture, as seen through a magnifying glass : the scene such as Teniers or Ostade might have selected. Two women, a young and an old one, are sitting spinning at the wheel.

Wilkie said of Velas quez, \" he paints the very air we breathe ;\" just so a clear and perfect mirror might be described as glass.

He put on the canvas what he saw. If it is wonderful to see a limb or a figure, even when all the picture is consecrated to that effort, break forth, as it were, from the dead surface and rise towards you, how much more to behold that canvas fly open and spread back, so that by the aid of a tremulous ray, breaking across it here and there, you may see around and distinguish things, places, and persons!

The Prometheus of Titian (121), lies on his back on the earth, with the heels in the air : the top of the head is the lowest part of the figure, and towards the spectator ; \u2014 the face is consequently not seen.

Such is \" the poetical treatment by our Italian.\" In No. 787, the Spanish master has painted a man full of life, not lying where he has been tossed, but held where he is bound.

In the vesture of a nun, with the halo of a saint and the crown of a queen, Isabella stands over a boy whose head she is laving. The boy bends over a large silver vessel, from which the reflected light illumines his flushed face and winking eye, leaning on the stool which supports the basin : he is suffering, but patient, under the hands that perform the office. How the soft fingers hold \u2014 yet scarcely touch \u2014 the head! \u2014 how gently they apply the napkin ! Beside her stands a maiden with a golden jewelled ewer ; she watches till the cloth is dry ; \u2014 an elderly lady looks from behind to counsel and aid her mistress. A second attendant carries a tray with ointment, and over her shoulder, in eastern fashion, hangs a lace embroidered napkin. The service is regal, not dramatic. There are other patients ready to be served. An old man in front is unbinding his leg ; another is limping in on \u2022 crutches from behind : there is no crowd, but there is work prepared for these lovely hands. The queen's eyes are averted from the sores beneath her touch, and rest on an old woman below, whose upturned face reveals awe and gratitude. The sores on the boy's head show the blush of granulation ; but the care of the queen is still required.

This head is the original, which Wilkie has copied for his great picture of Columbus. He was painting it when I first saw that artist, and I was struck by it as singularly inappropriate. I now saw how he had selected it \u2014 here it was masterly because suited to the character represented. It is without * I find in Mr. Stirling's work on \" Spanish Artists,\" that Murillo had a sister.

Wilkie admired it as the founder of a Basilicon, and placed it on the shoulders of the discoverer of America. The Isabella pourtrays charity ; the \" sleeping Pa trician\" \u2014 rest. The one abstracts the soul from sur rounding things ; the other subjects you to them : \u2014 you lighten your step and fear to tread. The Roman is seated in a chair by the table, on which lies his closed book ; he has gently dropped asleep, his head resting on his hand. Nothing is recumbent, but all is still : it is the rest of the spirit rather than the slumber of the frame : the spirit is elsewhere ; the sleep so light, yet the abstraction so deep, that you watch for a breathing. The light falls on his reclining head from the vision of Mary and her child above.

The eye is tortured by the glare, and the mind oppressed by the numbers. They were painted for altar-pieces ; they were designed to dwell in the glare of the Temple ; to be gazed upon by the kneeling penitent on the floor. How is it that, with our vir tuoso faith, our religion of sentiment, no one dreams of replacing them on their thrones or pedestals, where, with nothing to distract the thought or oppress the eye, they may, if no longer fitted to inspire devo tion, at least fill and raise the heart. Our age has produced a descriptive epic, of which Italy is the scene and heroine. Her fortune, ruins, arts, monuments, are the incidents ; the works of her genius are transmuted into verse ; and if the marble perished, the Venus and the Gladiator in Childe Harold, would live.

Where was the painting in Italy possessed of such a spell ? I may now confess that in Italy I never saw a pic ture that satisfied my judgment, however much it may have excited my admiration. In admiring one or more, there was an internal struggle to impose upon myself a standard of excellence, in what was the most excellent of known works. The canvases of Murillo reconciled me to myself, by presenting a higher level, or at least a more perfect adaptation. Other masters may have been in artistic powers superior to Murillo, but he excels in a perfect knowledge and judgment of him self in reference to the ends of art. What mortal power or genius could present a Transfiguration so that it should be natural ? What truth could there be in the struggle of the Giants and Jupiter ? Could you be transported in spirit to the foreground of Purgatory, of the Last Judgment, of a beleaguered Fortress, or a contested Field 1 What art could render simple an assembly of the gods \\ The paint ing might be exquisite, but the attempt would over power the master, or the subject would be beneath his power.

I feel that"], [870, "382 GREATNESS OF MURILLO. fascination \u2014 if fascination it be \u2014 where you clearly see the cause. No other painter ever awakened in me curiosity. In him there is the metaphysician no less than the artist. In other painters you may admire the painting \u2014 in other pictures the painter. In Murillo it is the poet. Colour is his verse, light and shadow his metre ; and his were dreams rather than poetry ; or he dreamed as a poet and painted when he awoke. There is no drama in his scenes \u2014 it is ecstacy or thought. From the metaphysics of the mind he passed to the psychology of the face : he painted no portraits, and yet every head is one. He selected the head as pourtray ing the character, and the character to suit the pic ture. It is not the beauty of form, but the innate connexion between mind and form which nature her self has traced in making the face the mirror of the mind which he stretched forth his hand to grasp. His own portrait I therefore inquired after, to see if I could recognise the man : it is painted by one of his best pupils. I have already said that I have recog nised his \" Isabella.\" When I meet his \" Patrician,\" I shall recognise him in like manner. When I saw his own picture I was startled most ; for it is the por trait of one who of all living men has exhibited, in the same qualities \u2014 that of judging of himself in refer ence to his work \u2014 Lord Metcalfe.

A Sevillian whom I was questioning about the fre quent assassinations, astonished me by denying that there were any. \" What you hear' of,\" said he, \" as murders are duels.\" I objected the knife; \u2014 he said, \" Well, the knife ; that is our weapon ; we fence, we do not stab ; the duel has its laws, the weapon its science.\" I thought this must be a figurative manner of describing some rude point of honour, and asked him to show me in what consisted the science. \" I am not expert,\" he said ; \" but if you are curious I will take you to a friend of mine, whom you can engage, as he is the best player in Seville ; and, since the death of Montez, in all Andalusia.\" I begged immediately to be conducted to the yue cador, and was introduced to the inner apartment ; which \u2014 as he united the calling of contrabandist to that of fencing-master \u2014 was filled with bales of tobacco. The subject was broached as a matter of business. He was willing to give me lessons, but would not under take to teach me.

I proposed commencing at once ; and next morning he came to me by day-light, at the inn \u2014 for it required a large room. A wooden dagger is used for a foil : it is about eight inches long, and in form like the old sacrificial knife : it is held by the closed fingers, the thumb stretching along the blade, and the edge turned inward. Round the left arm is wound the jacket as a shield. My teacher, putting himself in attitude, at once reminded me of the fight ing Gladiator. He thus commenced : \" You must hold your right hand down upon your thigh ; you must never raise it till sure of your blow. Your feints must be with the eye \u2014 the eye, hand and leg must move together. When you look here, you must strike there, and spring when you have cut, corta y huya. The left arm must be kept high, the right hand low, the knees bent, the legs wide, the toes forward, ready to spring back or forward. There are three cuts and three parries ; one point, \u2014 the point is low and at the belly- \u2014 St. George's au bas ventre : the cut must be across the muscle on the shoulder or the breast, or down well into the groin, so as to let out the bowels. Unless you know how to cut, it is of no use knowing how to fence.\" He knew nothing of our fencing, and was much surprised when I made application of it, and attri buted the advantages it gave to a natural instinct for the art. The result was, that in a week he had gone through the whole course, and the last day of my stay at Seville, he brought two of the proficients, and"], [873, "THE SCIENCE OF THE KNIFE. 385 we had a regular assault d'armes, the guests at the hotels being spectators. He honoured me at the in troduction by saying, that he feared me more than either of his two compeers, because I sprang better than the one, and cut better than the other. The attitudes are a study for an artist. There are not the stiff figures and sharp angles of our fencing ; but the rounded limb, the gathered-up muscle, the balanced body : \u2014 instead of the glance of the steel there is that of the eye. The weapon is concealed under the hand, and pointing down, so that not a ray betokens it. There is no boxer's fist or cestus, no crusader's helm or hauberk, no Roman's sword or shield. It seemed as if the hands and the eye of the man were equal to the claw of the tiger, or the tusk of the boar. It was a combat of beasts rather than a contest of men. There was the ambling pace, the slouching gait of the panther or the lion, or, rather, it was a mixture of the snake and the frog ; gliding like the one and springing like the other. This is the war of the knife, the Pelea de Navaja, falsely interpreted war to the knife. After missing a blow with the right hand, the knife, by a dexterous player, may be jerked into the left ; but this, if unsuccessful, is inevitable death. To jerk * it * \" Taking the poniard, called Puntilla, by the blade, he poised it for a few moments, and jerked it with such unerring aim, on the bull's neck, as he lay on his bent legs, that he killed the animal with the quickness of lightning.\" \u2014 Doblado's Letters, p. 156.

The most deadly of these feints is to strike the foot of your adversary sideways and so bring him down. A celebrated Juc cador named Montes (not the Torero), killed in this manner eleven men, and was at last so killed himself. The mantle or jacket round the left arm is used, not for the purpose of catching the blow, but of striking off the adversary's arm so that he may not reach. The guarding arm is always within reach, but always avoided ; for to strike at it would leave your side open, and the safety consists in keeping under your adver sary. The arms of the players were all scarred ; but that was in \" love fights.\" The edge of the knife is then blunted, or a shoulder is put to it, as in the case of the lances which they use with the bulls. The Sevillian was right. This is not simple assas sination : it is not the stab given in the dark, though of course we could only so understand a man being killed by a knife. A popular song at Seville is, the lamentation of a man imprisoned for \" stabbing\" an other : \u2014 he exclaims against the wrong ; justifies his legitimate defence of his maja ; calls upon the gaoler to testify to his treatment ; and, failing to obtain sympathy, rushes to the grates and appeals to the people : \u2014 Si venga gente pora aca !\" There is no song sung with more fervour by the ladies."], [875, "387 WITH THE NAVAJA. This is the most deadly weapon I know ; the dirk, the cama, the dagger, are grasped in the hand, and impelled by the leverage of the arm. The navaja may be so used, or plunged right on end like the Hindoo dagger, and also by the motion of the wrist alone : it more resembles mowing with the scythe than thrusting with a poniard : it is accompanied by the action of the sword, in which, as in fencing, the limbs come into play, and thus serves the purpose of a defensive weapon. It is the origin of our fencing ; and against adversaries not acquainted with that art, or not armed for it, it still retains all its ancient superiority : \u2014 in all cases it would be a valuable accessory to other weapons, without being an incumbrance, and serving for all the ordinary purposes of a knife. The navaja (pronounced navakha) is a clasp knife, \u2014 those worn by professed players are a foot long when closed. There is a spring to catch it behind, to prevent it closing on the hand. When opened there is the click as in cocking a pistol, and the sound is said to delight Andalusian equally with Irish ears. The art of fencing with it is called pelea de navaja. Pelea has been derived from frshka, or Ka2k\\og, of the Greeks ; but 1 give it a higher origin. The Pelethites and the Cerethites served in the armies of Jud\u00e6a ; and c c 2"], [876, "388 COMBAT BETWEEN though these were the names of two people, Hebrews seem to have borne subsequently that name. One of these passed into Greece as Cretan, and Creticus be came synonymous with bowman. The Pelethites, doubtless, used some other weapon, and what it was the ftikiu of the Greeks and the Pelea of the Spaniards plainly show. Not that the navaja came from Jud\u00e6a : the word is Basque, an original term signifying to make smooth, as with a knife. Had it belonged to the Iberi it would have been Etruscan in all probability, and the Romans would not have called it Spanish. Manlius Torquatus, indeed, used it when the Romans had no connexion with Spain : so that it was in Italy, and of course amongst the rem nants of the Siculi and Itali \u2014 if these, as I have sup posed, were the same as the Hispani. It must have been preserved in the same manner as the Spanish cap and shoes of which Seneca speaks. The single combat between Manlius Torquatus and the Gaul, occurred nearly two hundred years before the Romans set foot in Spain. The appearance of this barbarian in his armour appalled the Romans ; and the champion, when found prepared for the combat, by laying aside his Roman armour, was armed by his companions with other weapons. The historian de- scribes the combat as if \u2014 without understanding its peculiar feature, the mode of grasping the weapon \u2014 he were describing a Palea de navaja. \" The Roman,\" says Livy, \" held his sword close to the thigh, with the point raised, getting under the Gaul's shield, and too"], [877, "MANLIUS TORQUATUS AND THE GAUL. 389 close for the stroke of his long sword ; he then with a cut forwards and back, slit his belly and let out his bowels.\"* This would have been impracticable with a sword held in the common manner, or with the \" mucrone surrecto :\" thus held it would merely have been plunged in ; whereas it is the slicing of the navaja that he describes in the wound it made. Livy, writing four hundred years after, explains in the ordinary language, the use of an instrument with which he was unacquainted. It may be objected that a Roman must have been conversant with the sword of a country with which the Romans had been so long at war, but with our armies in Spain, with so many military and scientific men, artists, and philosophers studying its customs, the \" Pelea de navaja\" has not been so much as noticed, even as a curiosity. Else where Livy says, that the Spanish sword was more fitted to wound by its point than its edge : from its * \" Pedestre scutum capit, Hispano cingitur gladio ad pro piorem habili pugnam.\" \" Ubi constitere inter duas acies, Gallus velut moles superne imminens projecto l\u00e6va scuto, in advenientis arma hostis vanum, c\u0153sim, cum ingente sonitu ensem dejecit.

This is incompatible with the ancient sword, or modern fencing. In the description of battles with the Spaniards, the sword is never mentioned as a weapon used by them, when attacking a heavy-armed body, or resist- ing its attack. On more than one occasion their defeat is attributed to their spears being broken, when they would be expected to draw their swords : no mention is made of their drawing swords, and having only the \" navaja\" and spear. They could not after the loss of the latter, stand against the united mass of the legion with their short swords, nor defend themselves against a charge of cavalry ; but they appear to have been superior, man to man, to the Romans,4*' as these were to the Greek pha langite. It was not an exchange of one sword for another, but adopting the Spanish knife as a supplementary weapon. Machiavelli remarks, that by the distribu tion of the Roman legion into three ranks, it had * The author of Murray's \" Handbook\" makes the Spaniards such dastardly foes, as to fly from the Romans, before they come in sight, and he quotes authorities too. \" The very aspect,\" says Seneca, himself a Spaniard, \"of a Roman Legion, was enough, 'Hispani antequam legio visetur cedunt.' \" \u2014 Handbook, p. 312.

This explanation meets all the difficulties of the case. The Spanish sword was adopted, yet the Roman is not laid aside, nor are these two swords spoken of conjointly. It accounts for the distinction between sword and knife, and explains the Greek term, as used by Polybius, and supports Dr. Arnold's persuasion that in latter times the Pelites had a sword. A sword in the ordinary sense, they could not have had, for a sword requires a long shield, and then constituted the difference between the heavy and the light- armed. The nature of their tactics made swords superfluous. The Pelites advanced to skirmish and retreated through the intervals of the maniples, and formed again behind the legion. It was quite another thing to carry, as a protection for their persons, the Spanish navaja. I do not imagine that this \" Spanish sword,\" as adopted by the Romans, was the clasp-knife. It is likely that the model of it is preserved in the lath foil still used in teaching, and which is the sacrifi cial knife.* No instrument can be better conceived for ripping up the bowels of a man, or for cutting the throat of an animal. * In playing at lawn billiards, the Moorish children use the same for driving the ball, and hold it as the Spaniards do the navaja."], [880, "392 SPANISH SWORDS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. On my return to England, I was one day in the room of the British Museum, when Mr. Warshawy of Copenhagen, brought some bronze instruments from a Celtic cairn ; one of these I at once recog nized as the \" Spanish sword,\" although the form was new to me. Symptoms of incredulity, as was na tural, manifesting themselves, I asked the gentlemen present to handle the weapon. It was tried all round, and no one could grasp it so as to use it, in conse quence of a sharp-turned hook from the hilt which prevented it from being held, either as a sword or a dagger ; but which left space for the points of the fingers, as the Spaniards hold the navaja. I showed it to be what I said it was, by taking hold of it in the manner in which it had to be used. There are now four at the British Museum : they are of the Roman period, in bronze \u2014 in case 46, of the Bronze-room. One of them is fitted to go into a wooden socket, or handle, and is but one step from the clasp-knife.

What we consider in architecture is form or order. The masonry of Rome and her teachers, the Etruscans, of the Pelasgi, the Cyclopes, the Druids, and the Egyptians, present us with colossal and imperishable monuments. These depend entirely on mathematical principles and mechanical adjustments, because stone alone was used, nor have we any idea of another manner of building. There was, however, still an other race than these, which delighted in lofty towers and massive walls, who, without stones, built Babel and Babylon. The first point in architecture is, therefore, the material, and by that originally used must its sub sequent forms and order have been established. We have, indeed, kept this primary condition in view, and carried our application of it to the most extravagant excess. The cave of the Troglodit\u00e6, the timber origin of the Hindoo, Ancient Persian, and the Greek, the essentially rock origin of the Cyclopic, have been fully iUustrated ; and applying our rule in every case whence we had not a natural"], [895, "407 ARCHITECTURE. original, we created it. We have caused the Gothic to spring out of the interlacing branches of the forests of the North. Warburton* was, I think, the first who put forward this extravagance, supporting it by historical suggestions which consisted in ana chronisms ; but the same proposition recurs over and over again, as it furnishes a theme for that sort of stilted composition which has become the staple of the recent trade of book-making on art.f Architecture moulds itself into the shapes of things in use for building ; it does not copy the independent works of nature.

The origin of the Gothic is still to find ; an earlier material than stones is to be looked for ; and if we would go back to the origin, we must figure to ourselves the art of build ing as devised for defence, before descending to em bellishments, or to the lowly habitations out of which those temples arose, which have been distributed into and constitute the five orders of architecture. The Arameans, the elder branch of the human family and the inheritors of early light, first occu pied and permanently retained that fertile and well watered region, which lies between the great limbs of the earth and the subdivisions of the ocean. There, neither strong positions were to be found, nor stones to be procured for the construction of defences. Their very existence depended upon the invention of a process by which the earth itself could be converted into walls. The soil containing a large proportion of alumine, durable walls might be made from it without the aid of any art, save that of beating and ramming down. Factitious stones might be obtained, or the mass formed at once by cases into a wall.

The blood flowed on it, and \u2014 as in the case of Jupiter Olympius \u2014 it was plastered over with the ashes. In the alluvial plains of Mesopotamia, these altars must have been of brick in the mountainous districts, where alabaster as well as limestone abounded \u2014 gypsum and lime.

Having thus obtained lime, it was used as the dis covery suggested that it should be ; that is, to harden the earth-walls themselves \u2014 not to cement stones. They would soon discover that gypsum had to be set up in moulds, hardening at once of its own accord ; but that lime, mixing with the earth, or with gravel, acquired consistency by being rammed down. The varieties so presented are infinite, from the rudest, the cheapest, and the most perishable walls, to the most costly and durable ramparts ; and these could so be raised without machinery or science, yet affording a strength to resist the besieging operators of those times, of a height to surpass all means of assault, and of a durability that has defied Time itself.

As the dictionary affords no clue, we must endeavour to trace them back construc tively. Bochart accounts for the story of a tomb of Hecuba, in Sicily, by supposing that the Greeks, seeing some Ph\u0153nician tomb, and inquiring what the building was, were answered, \" Beth Hacub, suprema domus.\" The meaning of Beth they could not mistake, and Hacub could only be the unhappy consort of Priam. Sir W. Hamilton does justice to this explanation in a rigid criticism of the author. If Beth Hacub were so em ployed, the contraction to the last syllable is quite natural ; and as the tombs in Britain would be built of Tapia, the natives would call that substance by the same name \u2014 Cub \u2014 cob ; as the Ph\u0153nicians themselves may have contracted it.

Thus, the building has supplied the general name to Europe for its figure, to Devonshire for its substance, and in Morocco has remained with its primitive meaning, substance and figure. The mistranslation of the Greeks respecting Hecuba, receives a curious confirmation from a grotesque mis take of the French : they call these buildings mara bouts, and speak and write about marabouts as if it really were either an Arabic or a French name for Cubbe.-f Marabouts are men, and they are sometimes * Cybele is derived from tcv(irij3eii', i.e. kvtttuv, for she made her servants bow.

The Greeks had before them employed pavements ; and this word which we associate with stone* comes from pavire, to ram down, and could have no re ference to stone, but must have been the tapia of Canaan. When these artificers removed to countries where the soil was no longer aluminous, they would doubt less, although there were stones to build with, cling to their own fashion, as their buildings and the aper tures would of necessity depend, not on the adjust ment of the blocks, but on the adhesion of the walls. They clung also to their lofty towers even when they eould build on strong and naturally defensible positions. Thus we find the Jews gratified by being permitted to build lofty towers, and these have been the work of predilection of the sovereigns of Morocco and of Spain. * The Carthaginians first used stones for paving their streets and roads, so that from them was derived one of the monuments that has mainly perpetuated the idea of Roman grandeur and magnificence.

The vitrified forts * were round, so that this form distinguishes the Ara means from the Hindoos on the East, the Celts on the North, and the Aboriginal population of Europe on the West.

Here, however, it is burnt bricks we see : the clay is weighed, beaten into moulds, carried to the furnace blue, and brought back red. The Jews, therefore, had introduced this method. The soil of Egypt was not adapted for the block wall or sun-burnt brick, whilst the silex fitted it for burning. Thus having got the materials, let us see how they were used in the construction of their ordinary dwel lings. The Greek Triclinium- room was copied by the Romans. The Moors have also a form of room, but the method is different. The Greek house, as the Turkish, was a variable aggregate of integers, which were invariable. No light came from the door or from the side in which it was, and by which the room adjoined to the body of the house. From the side opposite to the door \u2014 that is the top \u2014 came the light from contiguous windows, as in the oriel win dows of the Middle Ages.

With the Moors it is exactly the reverse. Their building was a square of dead walls : the rooms were made to fit that form, and their light came by the door and the door alone : the door is in the length of the room, and divides it into two equal parts. Under the tent they were encamped always ready to march \u2014 in their houses they were fortified, ever in a state of defence. Their breccia they struck out into archways, or pierced with open works ; but win dows were as little known to them as stirrups to the Greeks or Romans. From this court, in the centre, come the lights. I need not repeat what I have already said respecting it, which the reader will find in the account of a Jewish house at Arzela. A Moorish house was made in the style of a cavern or grotto, and its pendulous interior fret-work strikes every one as something resembling the sta lactites of a cave (ieergiigepes, ccutoxtit upt^u). The weight, therefore, of the roof, and the deficiency of timber, conjoined to maintain that original struc ture of long narrow rooms adjoining the court-yard, which originated in the materials of their building and the necessities of their defence, and which were admirably adapted to their climate, and suited to the habit which it engendered of living in com munity."], [914, "426 TENT DWELLINGS. As the room of the Turks presents to us the Tri clinium of the Greeks, so do the houses of Morocco the dwellings of the Hebrews, and furnish the ex planation of obscure passages in the Scriptures : to the Moorish houses as exactly applies every term having reference to houses or buildings, as those having reference to clothing do to the Moorish dress. The Hebrews originally dwelt in tents. When they returned from Egypt they found the Holy Land filled with fenced cities. They came from the wilderness as the Arabs now do into Suez from the Sahara. They adopted the settled manners of the people, but tribes identified with them, such as the Kenites and Rechabites, continued to live under tents. The do mestic architecture of the Jews was thus properly Canaanitish, and is in Morocco what it was in the Holy Land when the Jews entered.

We are informed by St. Isidore that, in the fifth century, the Goths had adopted the same mode of building \u2014 of course from the Iberians, who are the source of most things which we are so fond of calling Saracenic in Spain, whether architecture, blood, manners, or words. Like Jud\u00e6a, Spain \u2014 though not to the same extent \u2014 had lost her original type, and Morocco remained, at the time of the Saracen conquest, the treasure-house of the ancient world, and the museum of human history.

That which attracts attention to the Moresque and awakens enthusiasm, is the tracery upon the walls, the pensile figures of the arches, and the domes with their colours. To these no reference is made in an cient writers, and of them no trace has been pre served ; yet are they embellishments too striking not to be observed, and too beautiful to have been lost in such an age. Had there been an Alhambra at Jerusalem or at Tyre, we should have found some thing like it on the banks of the Nile, where the Jews raised their rival temple ; in the Baths of Lucuilus or in the Palaces of Antioch. Greek Virtuosi then were spread over all these regions, and there were the Ptolemies collecting all the stores of art and literature, who garrisoned fortresses with the Jews, and who were spurred on by envy of Tyre and rivalry with Carthage. We have, then, two points most distinctly made out \u2014 first, that the substance of the waUs, and the structure of the edifices, the roofing, the wood-paint ing, of Jud\u00e6a, corresponded with those of Morocco. Secondly, that the embellishments of vivid and varied colours, and the delicate lace-work, known as Ara besque, did not exist in Jud\u00e6a. The latter constitutes, to our eyes, the Moorish ar chitecture, but, from what I have said, it will appear that it is but a garment over it.

We must look for it in some pe riod of greatness, of some seat of empire, under some prince pre-eminent in all the attributes which can command the admiration of men. We turn to Da mascus \u2014 to the Caliphat : we have no traces of it there, and no relic. The earliest monuments eastward are found at Alexandria, and then only in fragments ; and there is neither the thing nor the type. Did it, then, spring up on the soil of Spain, in that favoured region \\ No. We find it in the very earliest monuments of the Moors. When they entered Spain, it was already formed and complete. It was, therefore, in Morocco, that the architecture of Jud\u00e6a underwent those changes, expanded into those graceful forms, and robed itself in those rain bow colours. There are natural features and primitive habits which suggest or account for each of these modifica tions \u2014 features so striking that they could not fail to be observed, and so beautiful that they must have been copied : these I have described as they presented themselves to me. The types which I found in na ture or in practice are of the stalactitic, dome, and arch, \u2014 the horseshoe arch, the tracery on the wall, the diversified colouring of that tracery, the half globe dome upon the cube ; and these, in fact, are the modifications that the architecture of Jud\u00e6a re ceived, and by which it has been converted into the Moorish. On the material the system of architecture de-"], [918, "430 MOORISH STRUCTURES. pended, and it is wholly different from the classic. The great styles of antiquity depended, not on the adhesion of the stones, but their form and weight, and by science alone they obtained arches. Thus the perpendicular key-stone of the Egyptians, Etrus cans, and Romans, the horizontal and narrowing circle of the Pelasgi, the massive rocks carved and trans ported by the Egyptians, the inclining jamb of the Cyclops (Tyrius and Lamos), the column and enta blature of the Greek, all depended on mechanical science, and, therefore, the form of the passage through a wall, became a distinctive feature of a race. The tapia, by its adhesion, constituted as it were a rock in the form of a dwelling ; they required no mecha nical adjustments to obtain the openings, \u2014 they could make them at pleasure ; square, or with a semicir cular or pointed arch or a horse-shoe. They dug through the walls ; so, in like manner, could they carry them to any height, and build them for any number of ages. Hence, the square, massive solidity of the Moorish structure ; hence, the absence of all exterior lines of architecture for embellishments ; hence, the ornaments of the material itself; hence, the bold fa cility and the endless variety which they gave to their arches ; hence, the rich decorations and light ness of the interior contrasted with the exterior rude ness and gravity; hence, the adornment of that interior by tesselated pavements and variegated walls.

At last the word \" Gothic \" became a field of literary debate, and immediately of religious discussion.

In the religions of the ancient world, Fetichism lay at the bottom : the gods of the country were raised into deities, or these were brought down as patrons of the spot. It was an honour and a security to address them ; there was no idea of proselyting the arts ; the wealth of the votary or the stranger was expended on their service. Christianity presented a new character, the reverse of all that preceded it ; men were to be saved from craft and its devices, from art and its enchantments, from vice and its seductions, from the world and its wisdom.

The most common and primitive style of Moorish arching is the flat wall cut into the semicircle, sup ported without entablature on wall or column.

They contain the rudiments of the Gothic, Saxon, and Ro man styles. The tomb is a cube, surmounted by a half-globe vault. The door-way is an arch, horse shoe form, semicircular or pointed ; it is shouldered by a spandrel. Exactly the same are the tombs of India \u2014 the great monuments of Jehangir and Akbar, which by some, from a mistake in the date, have been considered as the type and the model of the Gothic. The building next in importance is the tower, which is composed of these cubes placed one above the other : the inner tower rises at the top higher than the outer one. In their domestic architecture they use flat roofs ; but in the mosques they employ rows of gable roofs, supported below by columns and arches. There are sometimes double rows of arches, and intersecting arches. Their dwelling-houses are enriched with a great variety of details, which may be compared to miniature representations of the em bellishments of our religious edifices, such as niches, small pointed windows, pierced spandrels, mouldings, and cornices.

The long vault and taper spire, indeed, were wanting; nor were there any buildings to which, as a whole, the title of Saxon, Norman, or Gothic could be ap plied. But then it occurred to me, that these modi fications might be traceable through the Saracens, and in their various settlements in Europe, down to the historical period of the art in its European sites. To pursue such an investigation appropriately would require a lifetime. However, I have examined build ings in sufficient numbers to trace, and I think estab lish, the connection. The Saracens were established, not in Spain only, but also in the important island of Sicily, and the southern extremity of Italy. These were conquered at an early period by the Normans, and the Saracens con tinued for half a century under them, working for them, building chapels, churches, palaces, and cathe drals.-f These Normans were in continual intercourse with their native country on the British channel. * Has the attention of architects, or of writers on architec ture, been directed sufficiently to Spain 1 A comparison of the genuine Saracenic remains in the Peninsula, with the earliest spe cimens of Spanish architecture, in their details might do more to illustrate the connexion of the two schools, and the history of the pointed style, than has been effected, or is likely to be effected by elaborate theories on the subject.\" \u2014 Foster's Mahometanism Unveiled, vol. ii. p. 252. t For instance, the Cathedral of Coutances, finished twelve years before the battle of Hastings."], [933, "CONNEXION BETWEEN NORMANS AND SARACENS. 445 Passing constantly through France, they soon after wards conquered England.

It is a remarkable fact, that a connexion so well au thenticated between the Normans and the Saracens, should be passed by unnoticed by the writers upon architecture. For my own part, when I stood within the north transept of the Cathedral of Winchester, where the Norman portion has remained undisturbed, I should have been sure of that connexion, had no records of it been preserved.

At the time of its erection this cathedral was esteemed the masterpiece of architecture, and as surpassing at once St. Sophia, and the St. Peter's, of that day. Pope Lucius says of it : \" Simile opus per aliquem regem factum non fuerit ab antiquis temporibus?

The Spaniards, as they recovered the country, were on the one hand, relieved from these sources of continual alarm ; and, on the other, were desti tute of those arts of interior decoration : hence a more aspiring exterior, and a more gloomy interior ; and upon the stones was concentrated the care which the Arabs had to give to so many other materials. There has been a great destruction in Spain of Moorish buildings.

VAULTING. This portion of modern architecture is Roman ; but it in no way suffices to say that the Roman had vaults to account for our having them : the models of a dead people do not introduce a new art ; the Sara cens did not copy the classical models.

The pointed and elon gated vault, with its intersections, was, therefore, ori ginal in the Gothic, and may have been constructed by the Saracens, in Spain. To it there was the closest approximation in their pointed arches, door ways, and windows. The gable form of their mosque roofs would suggest the pointed and not the semi circular vault. Whenever they covered these in stone, here was the point \u2014 where their original material, the tapia, failed, it could rise from four sides into a dome ; but elongated vaulting, and its intersections and groinings, depended upon the mechanical adjust ment of the separate stones. When they came to build in this fashion in Spain (as in Egypt, Syria, Sicily, &c), their mathematical skill would be called into play, and they must, of necessity, have thrown stone roofs over the large churches and cathedrals which they were employed by the Christians to build.* ARCHED GATEWAYS.

WINDOWS AND STAINED GLASS, From the want of windows in Moorish houses and mosques, and from the great dimensions, elaborate structure, and important office of windows in our churches and cathedrals, it might be supposed that here we should be at fault in tracing the connexion ; but the Moors afford us the most interesting rudi ments of the stone-framed figures of our window, and the painted glass with which they are embellished. Above and beside the door in Moorish rooms, there are small apertures for air rather than light, generally narrow, with a trefoil head. Two, four, or more of these may be placed side by side, and over them a circular figure pierced in like manner. In some of the Spanish cathedrals \u2014 and I again quote Toledo \u2014 there are windows which represent these openings in the wall, and are glazed. In the Alhambra, the Alcazar of Seville, and every other Moorish structure in Spain, there are to be seen the pierced work in stucco, in the form of Gothic windows ; \u2014 the patterns of these correspond with the tracery on the walls, which being in colour, it was natural to continue the"], [944, "456 GLASS FOR WINDOWS. patterns in colour to the open spaces ; and to effect this, where the exposure required it, bits of painted glass are stuck into the plaster while fresh. A colder climate would suggest the extension of the glass, the reduction of the stucco, and the substitu tion of stone for stucco. Glass for windows was peculiarly a Spanish art ; it was already known in England and France in the seventh century:* the staining of glass commenced in Spain, though it was carried to the highest perfection in France. Two of the colours and substances were designated Spanish at a time when few original colouring matters were em ployed.! The Saracens were, besides, proficients in the making of glass, whether transparent or coloured. The first I accidentally fell upon in the Mosque at Cor dova \u2014 they used coloured glass for the mosaics ; but it was opaque ; \u2014 they also understood enamelling, and in encaustic tiles they were unrivalled. Stained glass is, to this day, of universal use among the Easterns, who have spread more to the northward, and have adopted external windows. A Turkish room is a min iature cathedral, with its ascending floor ; its entrance opposite to its lights, and its clerestory windows, \u2014 for * Du Cange, v.

The apertures in the Moorish tapia thus became Gothic windows, and the pierced patterns of the stucco mullions and transoms, with cusped trefoils and foliage in stone, with the intervals glazed in stained glass : the adjoining portion of the wall must then have been pared away and bevelled out. The Moors were the first people to adopt this process, as apply ing it to military architecture : they adopted it for their loopholes and embrasures, while bows and arrows were yet in use. Their first external windows were embrasures \u2014 churches were built for defence as well as devotion. The bevelling in their walk is on both sides less without than within, exactly as it is practised in Gothic windows. BUTTRESSES.

The buttress is to be found among the Arabs, as early as the pointed arch, and as universally known, though not so commonly used.

Specimens are abun dant at Jerusalem, in Cairo, and in Sicily. I have met with no instance of flying buttresses : these, however, may be seen in Spain, carried to a width unknown elsewhere ; \u2014 as for instance, in the Cathedral of Seville. THE TOWER AND SPIRE. The -early English towers are copies of those of Morocco. The Moorish tower stands apart from the Mosque : so do our early belfries and the Campanile of Italy. The spire has been naturally suggested by the minaret, which may be connected with the obe lisk, being the only instance of the kind in the ancient world ; and the minaret having been first adapted to Saracenic buildings in Egypt, where it was engrafted on the Sma or square tower of the Moors \u2014 together they constitute our spire, as seen in the half tower, half minaret of Egypt.

In the angles of the quadrangle, the limbs of a projecting and wider arch seem to embrace and protect a sharper arch within.

The general resemblance of feature is also to be traced in the names, many of which I have already men tioned, such as, house-door, barbican, dairy ; but and ben, and cabail of the Highlanders ; roof, stable, gypsum-house, garret, and even burgh, which we have been content to take from the Greek %v%og, is after all an Arabic word, in common use for pigeon-house, when built in the form of a tower.* In conjunction with these we must take so many terms and usages, exhibiting an intimate connexion between Africa and England, dating from the decline of Roman power. In these observations I neither propound a new theory nor agitate a settled question. I present the good and valid reasons upon which our ancestors adopted a title, which we use with disgust and are endeavouring to discard. I trace our architecture back to the people to whom it properly pertains, and through them to an antiquity venerable in itself and deeply interesting from its association with the in spired writings.

A more perfect antidote there cannot be than that this \"Christian\" art, this weapon of pros elytism, by which no religious community achieves conquests, but by which all faith is smitten, should be itself Mussulman, and that we should owe the architecture (if there were any ratio between the supposed cause and the effect) which we attribute to the Bible, to the Koran. What would have been the reply of the early Christians, had such a mania then prevailed, to those who argued the truth of polytheism, from the temples that had been raised in its honour, or the statues with which they were adorned I * What, again, would those have said, whose works are now taken as models, had they been told that in a future age of light and freedom their walls and arches should become steps in the ladder of conviction, shibboleths in polemics and lists of orthodoxy !* In the long and vehement contests between the Christians and the Mussulmans in Spain, both reciprocally used the temples of the other, which were sometimes even divided between them. \" Men have before now been led to adopt Romanism by its fancied connexion with poetry, or painting, or Gothic architecture ; and if such men had lived while the mythologies of Greece or of Rome were living * The Wickham brotherhood, an association of Catholic Mys tagogues, headed by Pugin, voted those uncatholic, in an archi tectural sense, who did not believe in the Gothic of the thirteenth century."], [951, "INTO EUROPE. 463 systems, they would with equal reason have forsaken Christianity for heathen religions, in which art had arrived at its highest conceivable excellence. The adoption of religious views, merely because they are in some way connected with what is gratifying to our senses or our feelings, and without primary re ference to the evidence for their truth, is a proceeding which seems indicative of a practical disbelief in the evidence of any revealed truth, or of any religious truth whatever.\"* The inhabitants of England, who first introduced it in the North, did not call themselves Goths, but Saxons : nor were the followers of William, Goths, but Normans. The Gothic name had disappeared from Europe as the designation of any country, and the later modification of the style appeared, and the epithet was applied. But there was one country in which the name of the Goth was still preserved, and that was Spain. That name would, have disappeared 'in Spain as elsewhere, had it not been for the Saracen conquest. The Goths had not originally appeared in Spain as ravagers or conquerors ; they came in the name and with the authority of the Roman empire to drive out the Vandals, to put an end to anarchy, to protect property, and to sustain the laws. The people of Spain had evidently been disinclined to espouse the quarrel of the Goths against the Saracens ; but, in subsequent attempts to throw off the Saracen * Palmer on the Doctrine of Developement and Conscience, p. 86."], [952, "464 THE GOTHS. yoke, the Goths must have been their leaders ; and in fact to be a Goth was to be a freeman, and no longer tributary to the Mussulmans. As the Christians re acquired strength, they could neither take the title of Andalusians, nor of Murcians, nor of Castilians, far less of Spaniards, for these names belonged as much to the Mussulmans as to themselves. They took, therefore, that of Goths, an ancient and a noble name, and associated at once with their national in dependence, the traditions of Rome, and the authority of the Christian Church ; and to this day the peasant of Spain, when he points out a great monument, will say, \" Obra de los Godos.\" Gothic is to them syno nymous with heroic \u2014 the Gothic times, the Gothic kings, Gothic courts, Gothic laws, Gothic glory.
