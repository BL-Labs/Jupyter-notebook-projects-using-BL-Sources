His friends drank his tokay, and regretted his democratic princi ples, not that he interfered much with politics, art was his passion, and of art, however em bodied, he was one of its tried worshipers.

The years that had made him famous \u2014 had aged him before his time. There were lines of deep thought on his noble forehead, from which the hair was slightly worn and tinged, young as he still was, with grey, but so it had been from the day his sister died.

He cared little to hear a new singer, or a new composi tion, but accept he did, and the two men entered the house as the third part was about to begin. Two gentlemen were already in the box \u2014 one a Royal Prince, the other one of the Ministers. Prince Friedrich of Esel, a slight, fair, aristo cratic young man, was a passionate worshipper of music, and report hinted, a still more pas sionate worshipper of fair Adrienne Sterbach. He greeted Beaumanoir good-humouredly. \" I hardly expected to see you in the house,\" he said. \" I thought you impervious even to the charms of our queen of song.\" Beaumanoir took a chair immediately behind him, and finding that he was doomed, listened with as much patience as he could to the elo quent enthusiasm of the Prince. \" This is quite a new thing,\" said the Prince ; \" a vocal symphony written expressly for her by a young musician, who has bravely earned his laurels by this first essay.\" \" Has your Highness heard,\" said Barbarini, bending over and addressing him, \" Von Grohl won ten thousand louis at Baden the other night.\" 11 Mon Dieu J what luck,\" said the Prince, g 3"], [132, "124 THE CAR RE R OF with an envious sigh. \" Is not that Count Mauberg and his wife in that box?

There was a lull in the orchestra, then the composer tapped his baton on the desk, and the opening chorus of the last part began. The Prince leaned back and addressed Beau manoir. \"The leader to-night is the composer himself, Leinder.\" Beaumanoir started, and in spite of long years of self-command, a change came over his features. With that name so carelessly pro nounced, what memories were not linked. The young Prince, his opera glass fixed intently on the stage, did not notice him. Robert's eyes were bent upon the ground. He heard no note of the music ; lost in thought he sat, until after a few minor chords, there stole upon his ear a voice so full, so soft, so marvel-"], [133, "125 A RISING MAN. lously sweet. Again he started \u2014 again that voice, echo of days long past, smote to his inmost heart. Every fibre in his frame trembled with strong emotion ; forgetting time and place, he leant forward ; the Prince turned \u2014 \" Take my glass, Herr Beaumanoir ; is she not divine.\" His hands clutched the glass convulsively ; then, with one effort, calming himself, he raised them, and looked at her steadily; changed so that few would have recognised her \u2014 beau tiful still, but with a subdued and more intel lectual beauty \u2014 with that look in the eyes that betrays to a close observer years of suffer ing and pain, dressed plainly in black velvet, and her dark hair simply braided, there before him stood the daughter of his enemy, the child of the ruined gamester \u2014 Adrienne Steinheim. For the next half hour he sat lost in his own thoughts. He heard the conversation in the box as in a dream. At length the door opened, another gentleman entered, and seizing the opportunity, he rose from his chair, and bowing to the Prince, said something of a remembered engagement, and in a moment more stood alone in the calm, fresh evening air.

Kielbach, with several others, ran out in pursuit. Paus ing to tie his handkerchief round his arm, Beaumanoir gave to the two or three who sur rounded him, an account of the business as far as he was witness to it. The lady still busied herself with the old man, who seemed much shaken by the fright; the woman, released from her bonds, rushed to Beaumanoir, and vehe mently kissing his hand, vowed that he had saved them from being murdered. The only light in the room was from one of the lanterns that the thieves had dropped ; the Englishman still wore his cap low over his eyes, and spoke in German, aud in a subdued voice, standing on oue side away from the father and child.

Robert Beaumanoir was independent, his own exertions, and Herbert's noble liberality, had made him so. He was without relations to consult or consider.

Where have we wandered to ? I was saying that Prince Frederick of Esel was held, by all the artists basking in the rays of the Court of Esel, to be not only a patron, but a performer of no mean pretensions. \" Tortrefflich !\" was the cry. \" Tortrefflich \u2014 for a Prince.\" I should not wonder myself, that if he were to take up the artist's staff and"], [195, "187 A RISING MAN. knapsack, he might earn quite four thalers a month in any garden through Germany. But Prince Friedrich, not content with performing on the violin at the amateur concerts at the Court of Esel, was also composing an opera, especially for the Hof Theatre of that salubri ous capital. It was brought out some time afterwards, and although the drums, double basses, basoons, and other mild instruments, had rather more work than was necessary, still, on the whole, it was not so bad, all things con sidering ; and it was, in spite of the drums, severely classical and cold ; and did not too much affect the feelings as was proper in such high society. But I grieve to say, that the Herr Director M filler, the Herr Director Leinder, and other musicians, used to speak in very contemptuous terms of the opera in ques tion, as the score came, page by page, into their hands. It is true that they arranged the instrumentation and the harmony, and some times the composition. But it was very dis respectful of them to insinuate that it wouid be better if his Highness would study a little finance, and try to make two ends meet with his Soda Water business, and the little gam bling concerns kept open upon the premises. Count Casimir Ton Norlungen paced up and down his room in the British Hotel."], [196, "188 TnE CAREER of We have, as yet, hardly mentioned this nobleman, he was generally so silent, either from shyness or hauteur, at once so reserved and apathetic, that few people, if questioned about him, could have answered more than tha7 he was an officer in the Prussian service, attached at present to the Court of the Prince of Esel ; that he had few relatives, little wealth, and apparently few capabilities. This gentleman, then, paced to and fro his room, a pocket-book clasped in his hand, his brows bent thoughtfully, his teeth pressed tight \u2014 seemingly following out a train of thought that baffled him at every turn. This pocket-book lay at the back of the drawer in his Highness's escritoire. The Prince had gone to Potsdam, and had sent Leinder to him for the finale to the first act of his MS. Opera, \" Leonidas.\" The MS. had been mislaid, and in searching for it, Ton Norlungen had found this old faded velvet pocket-book, that had the power to cause him such visible emotion \u2014 and Ton Norlungen, usually so calmly apathetic, was breathlessly following out the schemes of ambition aroused in him by that dingy pocket book. Norlungen, born, reared, educated, and formed in and for the intrigues of a small German court, was roused to full exertion when he found that fate seemed to have destined him"], [197, "189 A RISING MAN. to conduct an intrigue, upon which might hinge his whole after fortunes ; for that pocket-book, in the private possession of the Prince Ton Esel, embroidered with the cipher L. S., contained, with several letters, a miniature of the singer, Adrienne, and tallied exactly with the descrip tion given by Sterbach himself of the one stolen on the night of that mysteriously attempted burglary. Norlungen sat down and pressed his hand to his brow ; his dormant ambition had at last found a tangible aim. The burglary \u2014 Adrienne Sterbach \u2014 the Crown Prince von Esel \u2014 how few men had had so fair a stepping stone to fortune. The Prince, young, fiery, one-and-twenty \u2014 his father, old, with sinking health and decayed powers ; and Norlungen had lately caught his royal master deep ii the study of Schiller's Robbers \u2014 writings fit to rouse the Pbbel to sedition, but of what possi ble interest to a Prince he could never imagine. Nay, even so late as last night, his Highness, smoking a cigar and watching the moon, turned suddenly round to himself Graf Ton Norlun gen, and tapping the carpet with his small foot, had asked him what in the name of Heaven he would have done if Amelie had treated him, the Count, as she had treated Franz Ton Moor, if he did not think it almost excused that dastard his tissue of crimes and"], [198, "190 THE CAREER OF hypocrisy \u2014 if he did not think that, wahrhaf tig in Gott he would have done it himself with the same temptation. \" God forbid,\" Norlun gen had solemnly replied, but the Prince did not seem to care for, or hear his answer \u2014 it was more the expression of his own thoughts, than a wish for that gentleman's opinion. So, then, he was in love with a singer. But could the rest be true ? Was it possible that he had done so mad a deed, had run such risk, had so far forgotten himself \u2014 his station \u2014 the pos ible consequences ? He had attended him to the opera that evening. Directly afterwards, the Prince had pleaded a violent head-ache, and retired for the night, but pressed him to attend a supper at Barbarini's. He remem bered now that he had urged him to go almost in his own despite, and that when he returned to the hotel, long after midnight, he heard that his Highness had given orders that he was not to be disturbed until he rang the next morning. Could he, in these few hours, have played so mad a game ? Adrienne was very beautiful \u2014 cold and proud as Diana's self. Ha ! a tnought flashed across his mind ; he remem bered that some months since, when they were before in Berlin, the Prince had all at once declared his wish to disguise himself, and look, for once in his life, misery, poverty, and crime"], [199, "191 A RISING MAN. in the face ; and he had persevered. Haroun al Raschid had penetrated into the Alsatia of the Prussian capital. That time Norlungen, in great disgust, had accompanied him, but who should say that he had not repeated the frolic. Norlungen still held his face covered with his hands, and thought. The wonderful courtesy to Robert Beaumanoir \u2014 the mixture of embar rassment and condescension with which he treated him ; here, then, was the clue to the puzzle. In a few moments, Norlungen seemed to have added ten yeaars to his age. He had crossed the barrier that divides the vain, affected, indolent youth from the scheming, politic, thoughtful man. What passion is so strong as ambition ! It had found its object, and that attained or no, it would never sleep again. Some years after, when Norlungen was, indeed, minister ; when his great talent had given to the Court of Esel a predominance in the German Bund that it had never before enjoyed, and when, partly owing to that in fluence, the whole land was shaken to its very centre, and all Europe threatened with a mighty convulsion, who would have believed that the first little commencement of that man's career was owing to a drawer open and a letter found."], [200, "192 THE CAREER OF CHAPTER Till.

Norlungen was the son of a man who had, for thirty years of his life, been Minister at a small Northern Court, a man of wonderful"], [201, "193 A RISING MAN. talent, immense energy, great powers, but singularly misplaced. In a proper field, the man might have become a Metternich or a Talleyrand ; where he was, he fretted away his life against a chain that he could not break. In theory, he was one of the greatest states men that ever lived \u2014 in practice, one of the worst. To further his great projects, he ruined the kingdom, and he who had in his head the ideas of a Charlemagne or a C\u00e6sar, avoided an impeachment only by a voluntary exile. He retired to Esel, it was told his master that he was poor \u2014 almost indigent in his old age. \" His own fault,\" said the Prince, \" why did he not make a fortune \u2014 it was in his power.\" So he died, and left his son to the protection of the Grand Duke ; some said that he died of a broken heart ; others, that he expired on hearing that B , the most commonplace twaddler in Europe, who had succeeded to his portfolio, had signed a treaty that he, with his great plans, had worked all his life to attain, without avail, but on his death bed he called his son to him ; and spoke to him somewhat to the following effect : \u2014 \" Casimir my child \u2014 my days are numbered VOL.

It was a strange lesson to give from a death bed, but he was a disap pointed, heart-broken man, who, after years of deep study, of profound thought, of anxious care, saw his sublime ideas cast clown, the labour of a life destroyed, himself neglected and forgotten, still knowing what he might have been.

But Adrienne had learnt the great lesson of adversity \u2014 she had learnt her duty towards others \u2014 she heard her father's voice, and dashed the hot tears from her eyes, smoothed her fair brow, and taking up her work, looked to him a cheerful smile of wel come as he entered, She was rewarded, for immediately after Steinheim, followed, with outstretched hand, and that strange, tender smile, Robert Beaumanoir. She had never seen him before as he was that evening ; at first he spoke with Steinheim, then lamps were brought in, and Steinheim took some English papers that Beaumanoir had brought with him to his own table, and Beaumanoir laughingly helped Adrienne to prepare tea. The tea was removed, he still sat by her little table, but his gaiety had vanished, and in its stead there breathed a gentle deference, a tenderness that only Adrienne, in the very humility of her pride could have mistaken. A volume of Shelley's poems lay on the table, and Beaumanoir, opening it at '.' The Revolt of Islam,\" asked her to read.

The blinds had not been drawn, it has been said before, that from the road y7ou could see into that room. Count Norlungen was about to visit Adrienne. He had before deigned her such small attention, that he now wished, if possible, to obtain some little knowledge of her character. As he drew near, he saw a man standing like a statue by the gate, he recognised the musician, and fol lowing the direction of his eyes, saw the fair picture of happiness and love within. Leinder spoke no word, but the heaving of his breast, and clenched hands needed no words to explain his feelings. Norlungen stood watching him for some little time, then, as it suddenly resolved, advanced, and touched him on the shoulder. \" A rather dangerous rival, Herr Leinder,\" he said. *' Gnadiger Herr,\" said Leinder, trembling"], [212, "204 THE CAREER OF with suppressed passion ; \" I am at a loss to understand \u2014 \" \" My dear Herr Director,\" interrupted the Count, \" there is nothing difficult in the mat ter.

The carriage in which he had come was stand ing there \u2014 the impatient horses pawing the ground.

Norlungen, maddened alike by the frustration of his plot, and by the insults he had been forced to submit to, lost all self control at finding himself foiled even in the attempt to restore her to her father without further scandal. He sprang forward with an oath, and snatching the postillion's whip, struck the man furiously across the head. With a cry he staggered, and then rushed upon him, and Norlungen recognised the musician. \"You \u2014 you,\" cried the musician, gaspingly.

He understood the vindictive smile that for a moment sharply contracted his ghastly face. He reared himself on one arm, touched his breast, and pointed with quivering finger to Norlungen, fell back, groaned and died. Before Beaumanoir, with Adrienne, entered the little cottage, Norlungen was on his way to the frontiers, and the Prince found important letters obliging his immediate return to Esel.

As he so sat, the fez drawn down over his sun burnt countenance, there was something in his thoughtful, and grave face more attractive than it had been even in the days when Berkeley Lascelles was esteemed one of the handsomest men in England. And now, in the still air, comes the cry of the Muezzin, to the Faithful proclaiming the greatness of God, and though the summons was to those of another faith, he bowed his head in still more solemn thought. As the sun was about to set, a horseman, passing through the gates, had asked, and been directed to the tent, and now approached it. \" Marco,\" said the Englishman, to his dra- goman, \"is not that a Frank traveller that is approaching ?\" \" Ecclenza, yes.\" \" He is coming towards us; go ask him if he will share my tent.\" Marco bowed low, and departed on his mis- sion, the traveller reined up as he advanced to him \u2014 heard his message \u2014 then putting spurs to his horse, galloped by7 him, and leaped to the ground, at a few paces from the other.

And the crescent moon rose in the clear heaven, the stars floated in space, the brook of Baalbec reflecting the bright orbs ; the mountains towered darkly in the back ground, the camels crouching down ; by their fires lay the Arabs ; further off came the murmur of the new comers talking with Marco, and all was so grandly calm that the heart rose and swelled with the solemn feelings of the time and place. \" It is an hour,\" said Lascelles in a low voice, \" to be remembered in one's after ex istence when the spirit life is so strongly felt within, that were there no written word, it were the witness of a God !\""], [316, "308 THE CAREER OF CHAPTER III.

This was evi dent in the painful anxiety with which he avoided all allusion to the cause of his exile.

After some little time, as he did not return, he felt anxious, and rising went to the opening of the tent. He thought that now in the almost awful stillness it was even more beautiful than before. The glorious Syrian moon flooded mountain and plain and stream in one calm and silver light. And the memories of the Past going far back into the night of distant ages, Trevanion with more of the poet stirring within him than he had ever felt before, watched the noble columns still so proudly rising to the clear heaven, until it seemed as though the hurry, the turmoil of the busy west was but a vexed dream \u2014 that this eternal calm was the only reality. He wakened from his reverie to look for Berkeley, and not seeing him, cautiously stepping over Marco sleeping on the threshold, he went in search of him. His presence had awakened a tide of bitter memories in the worn heart of Berkeley Lascelles; the anguish ever living there was stirred to new existence. He found him prostrate on the ground with his face lying to it, his breast heaving with deep groans.

As Trevanion had now joined him, Berkeley hurried over his business with the Emir, and accompanied him back to Damascus. Not to alarm him, his friend no longer pressed his return, trusting to opportunity, and he did wisely. As the time drew near for his departure, Lascelles began to think, with regret, of his loneliness without him. There is hardly an European who can conform so utterly to the dreamy indolence of the East, that he does not, after a time, feel the longing to be again among the stirring and busy drama of a living people ; and at the time many things tended to aid Tre vanion's kind wishes. The lawless and depre datory warfare in which his protogis indulged, rather alarmed his sense of propriety. His journey to Baalbec had been undertaken to"], [325, "317 A RISING MAN. remonstrate with the chiefs of some of the Metualis on the horrors of which many of the insurgents had been guilty. They had evaded his request and wishes, and the sensitive Englishman felt vexed and disgusted. The alternate crouching and wild ferocity of his allies rather damped his ardor. If Mehemet Ali was cunning and sanguinary, so were the greater part, alike of friends and foes. The tiger war carried on could not quite satisfy the frank and loyal Englishman. Trevanion, with his quiet irony and cool smile, fanned the smoulder ing embers of his discontent. He had never entirely conformed to the soft repose of his indolent neighbours, it was evident in his restless wandering from place to place. He came back to Damascus to mature his plans, or to study for a while, but he never remained there long. He was either across the desert to Palmyra, or among the more hardy races of the Lebanon, making himself a pursuit. The wealthy Turks of Damascus treated him with great respect ; by his restless wanderings, by his love of excitement, alternated with deep gloom, they thought him possessed by an evil spirit. They had been partly influenced to this belief, by what had been observed when he first came among them. For had he not been seen pacing with disordered strides, by the clear"], [326, "318 THE CAREER OF waters of the Barrada, with breast heaving and eyes wildly fixed, speaking to some invisible presence, and did they not know that the Djins then held converse with him ?

That he knew where, in the ruins, lay the long buried treasures of past ages \u2014 did he not wander among them to guard his hidden wealth? This belief insured him against insult, even from the most fanatic Osmanlee \u2014 nay, it gave him his greatest influence. Lord Trevanion found, as he had expected, that his spirits were depressed by his long absence from the scenes to which he was accus tomed. His health was wretchedly bad, and he was haunted by the thought of an early death. He discovered, to his surprise, that he yearned for home. Why, then, after the first year or so, he had persisted in his voluntary exile, Trevanion was at a loss to understand. He was to leave in a few days. The two friends were walking in the cool sbade of the garden of Berkeley's house. \" 1 suppose,\" said Trevanion, after a long pause, \" that this is my last visit to the East."], [327, "319 A RISING MAN.

Accustomed to the staid dignity of solemn Turks, or the wild freedom of the mountain tribes ; to the mystic wisdom that he had learnt in Egypt, to the customs of the Arabs, the same now that they had been, when the Sheik Abraham, sitting at the opening of his tent, entertained angels unawares, he thought of the calm and studious hours he had passed among them, and forgot subjects of annoyance and disgust. Its old enchantment returned.

As that night he lay on his sleepless bed, while his thoughts traversing the thousand miles be tween, he mused of home ; of all the greatness of that land, of party and power, he thought nothing, but only of one little spot, where, under a drooping willow slept the loved and lost. For the next week all was bustle and pre paration. Grave visits of ceremony, and long letters to distant chiefs ; many promises to different tribes to hurry the coming of the Frank deliverers, much disappointment from many who thought that in him the deliverer had already come. Not that Berkeley had willingly deceived them ; but Lockman had proudly magnified his consequence, and his Dragoman had still further exalted the ' Lord of Montserrat.'

Robert, meanwhile, walked on with a coun tenance that, though grave and serious, was still calm. The passionate grief for her loss had long since passed away ; he thought of her now with love and reverence ; and blessed God that he had only tender and gentle memories of her. He could even hope, that some day, not very far distant, he should bring another to visit her grave, and so fulfil one of her latest wishes.

He turned aside before he reached the village, and went along the narrow lane that leads to the Church. It was getting dark and very cold ; before he had gone very7 far the Church clock struck five. How well he re membered the sound \u2014 how well he remem bered those Sabbath evenings when he would lean out of the window looking with gloomy eyes into space \u2014 the bells ringing peacefully for Church \u2014 and how she would come in, in her close bonnet and shawl looking to him a mute appeal \u2014 that he \u2014 what pain the remem brance now gave him \u2014 would not notice ; then how, with fevered eyes, he would watch her slight form down the road, the little graceful head bent, and the handkerchief, perhaps, fur tively raised to wipe away the tears in her timid eyes; then, the bells ceased, the clock would strike solemn and slow ; and how laugh ing bitterly at her simple faith and his own wretched unbelief, he would wish he might never hear the sound of the clock again. As he thinks of these things, his eyes, too, fill with tears, aud he lifts the latch and enters the gate of the place where she sleeps, with a"], [344, "336 THE CAKEER OF hushed step, as if she still lay on her little bed and he feared to waken her. .Under the shade of a weeping willow, and, with a white rose-tree at the head, was the resting-place of Alice Beaumanoir ; a plain stone was raised to her memory, simply bear ing her name, and her age when she died, eighteen ; the rose-tree was bare, and the flowers lay dead in the grass \u2014 they would waken in the coming Spring, as she had wakened long ago \u2014 but they would die again and live no more \u2014 and she lived now for ever. So Robert drew near with quiet steps and solemn thoughts, such thoughts as God some times grants to us ; so great, so grand, so holy, that they are more a floating and vague feeling of something pure and spiritual, more like a dream of angels than an effort of the mind. He could see in the dim light the white stone, looking cold and shadowyy ; only when he was almost close he drew back, for hidden before by the dark shade that the willow threw upon it, Le now saw that he was not alone. A form was lying prostrate, in an utter abandon ment to grief, on the damp grass that grew upon her grave. Robert was not aware that Berkeley Lascelles had returned to England, but he knew at once who it must be, and, for the first time, seeing him lying there, he felt"], [345, "337 A RISING MAN. that he might have done him wrong ; that he must have loved her with real passion. Were there not a thousand ways in which he might have been misled ; and if not, was not this bitter repentance ? He drew near ; the man lay still. She had joined their hands with her feeble fingers \u2014 she had said there could be no enmity between them for her sake. He stooped. \" Sir,\" he said, in a low voice. Berkeley, springing to his feet, looked at him wildly, for a moment, then recognising him, drew his cap down over his brows, and turned away ; but not before Robert bad seen how changed he was, in feature, and manner, and expression ; if he had met him anywhere else he would hardly have kno.>n him. He almost expected that he would speak, but he did not, perhaps, because at the moment he had not the power ; but, bending his head, he passed him hurriedly7, and before Beauma noir could decide whether to address him or no, was gone.

Lascelles was already far on his way to the next post town, where the carriage that was to take him on to Montserrat was waiting. Mrs. Graves, excellent and injured woman, was right. Beaumanoir did small honor to her dinner ; it was true that he only ordered it out of courtesy ; for he had hardly ten minutes to spare, having to dine in Grosvenor Square with Herbert, and the few leaders of their party then in Town at half-past seven.

A week before the elections, Berkeley Las celles, with Lord Trevanion, had landed in England.

And such was his welcome home. He found the house full of company ; his father out canvassing ; Mrs. Lascelles doing the honors to people she had never seen before in her life. She looked so old, so feeble, so worried with Algernon's apostacy, and Berk eley's return, that he gave up the hopes of an explanation until all this business should be at an end. He cared very little about politics himself, but he was vexed and annoyed at the rumours that had reached him of his father's convenient change of principle. He escaped from their guests to wander about the park, and down the village ; and when he did meet Algernon, was glad that they were not alone, and that strange eyes watching them obliged him to control his emotion. To do him justice, Algernon Lascelles was overjoyed to see him ; and linking his arm through his, he proudly introduced his son ; though more than one young lady asked if that was the handsome Berkeley of whom they had heard 60 much ; he was not at all good looking, so sallow, and his eyes sunken, a large"], [352, "344 THE CAREER OF moustache quite hiding his beautiful mouth ; and he slouched in his walk, and looked, after the first excitement of return had worn off, listless and in bad health. As if a man was to remain an Adonis for ever ; and was to come back from years passed beneath a burning sun, with a complexion as clear and preserved as well as though he had all that time gone through no greater hardships than a shooting party in the Highlands. \"Proud to make your acquaintance, sir,\" said Mr. Simpson, Algernon's election lawyer, a young gentleman of tolerable abilities, which, in the universal benevolence of his heart, he consecrated without any absurd scruples to any purpose in which they might be useful ; bis charity being too universal to suffer him with ill-judged austerity7 to refuse his aid to any person who paid honestly. The great effort of this young man was to look with his slim figure, and abundant curls, as unlike a lawyer as possible ; for this purpose he carried silver mounted canes, and wore abundant jewellery, cut away coats, stylish waistcoats, smoked constantly, and altogether had completely triumphed ; not having been known moreover in the memory of man, to have any business to transact that was not peculiar, or, at least, touching the verge of"], [353, "345 A RISING MAN. respectability. But he was great for election purposes, for he was an honored guest, if nowhere else, in every tap-room throughout Lyncham and Montserrat ; and being not bad looking and addicted to flowery speeches, was, in most of them, a Lion. So Jack Simpton abused talents that might have made him honored, and had not even the consolation of becoming rich, for his unlucky private propen sities swallowed up his public gains. So Mr. Simpton said \u2014 \" Proud to make your acquaintance, sir,\" \u2014 and Berkeley, who knew him of old for a radical, and a man of no great reputation, thought, as he bowed very distantly, that he had been too easily disgusted with his cunning Anzeyrys, and light-fingered Bedouins. \" You are a happy man, Mr. Lascelles,\" continned Jack \u2014 \"you can obey the dictates of caprice, and fly at will far from the busy haunts of man.\" And Mr. Simpton smiled, fancying that, with his hand to his side, and his hat perched on one curl, he had the complete air of a man of fashion. \" Imagine the folly of an opposition to us, sir,\" continued Mr. Simpton, growing eloquent. \" Imagine, in this free and enlightened age, any man being idiot enough to make a stand for the bigotted principles of our ancestors \u2014 not only a 5"], [354, "346 THE CAREER OF that, but daring to make that stand in a borough where one quarter of the voters are either the tenants or tradesmen of your honored father.\" \" I daresay he was simple enough to think that his chance would be the better \u2014 that in free and enlightened times like these all such corrupt influence was at an end.\" Berkeley spoke so seriously that even Jack Simpton was deceived, and privately called him a fool. \" Whatever he may think,\" answered Simpton, \" if he has a chance my name's not John Simpton.

It was the first time that Lyncham had ever known the delights of a contested election. Until then, as its population was small, Mr. Lascelles, for the sake of old association, had been returned, as a matter of course. But the happy week drew to a close ; and by that time even Beaumanoir, who had begun the contest as an unpleasant duty and with almost compassion for Algernon, had been roused to the proper degree of irritation by the squibs, and caricatures against him, and foresaw his triumph with complacency. There were additions, too, to the .Montserrat party. Augustus Marchmont had come down, and met Berkeley with the unconscious dignity of a married man ; he had brought with him Spencer, and two or three more, to enjoy the fun, and celebrate the return of Mr. Las celles; Spencer wrote squibs so ingeniously, and verses a foot long in the Lyncham Gazette, which we.e very witty, and as they alluded to some rather tender points in Robert's past life, made him wince in spite of himself.

Unconscious of his danger, of the muttered word, the sullen scowl, the menacing gesture, the new member moved on in deep thought ; exhausted by the conflict, by the emotions of the last few days, his eyes were downcast, his form more bent. At the opposite windows, a few of Mr. Lascelles' s party were still lounging, watching their dirty friends without. Lascelles had gone home in disgust.

He made another step, then some ruffian from behind tried to knock his hat in. His prudence gave way, he turned, and caught the fellow by the collar \u2014 then the scuffle began.
