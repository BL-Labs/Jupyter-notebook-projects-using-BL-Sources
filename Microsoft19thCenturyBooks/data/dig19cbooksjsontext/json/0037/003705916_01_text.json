THE OLD CROSS BOOK-STALL. A MONG the many delightful memories one brings home from a Continental tour, the quiet saunters in the quaint market-places of old German and Dutch towns are, I think, among the very pleasantest. It is not the sight alone of the heaps of fresh vegetables, and baskets of glossy cherries, and stalls of fragrant flowers, presided over by women in blue-striped cotton gowns, with snow-white linen napkins tied over their heads, mapping out comely sunburnt faces, that is the most engaging feature of attraction ; nor the music of the water mingling with the babblement of human voices, as it flows from the fantastically carved mouth of the old stone fountain into its moss-stained basin ; but the picturesque surround-"], [26, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 12 ings rather of all this bustle, and colour, and light, and shade, which gives the combination as a whole its most unique charm, at once filling the eye with a sense of artistic satisfaction, and pensively touch ing the imagination with the glamour of history and romance. For the market-place is generally situated in the centre or most ancient part of the town, under the very shadow of the Rathhaus or Grey Cathedral, from the niches on the walls of which mutilated and crumbling apostles, and can onised saints, and Popes and Emperors, and mailed warriors have looked down for hundreds of years, mute witnesses of the trafficking and gossiping of a score of generations of the sons of Adam. Is it not possible, however, without travelling so far from home, to find something equally as fine ? The common reproach, that the tourist is blind to the beauties amid which he was born and perhaps lives and labours from day to day, and is all eyes and astonishment in the streets of a Continental town, I have no wish to cast up to him, for daily familiarity with a common object has a tendency, if not to breed contempt, at least to render the most watchful of us insensible to its worth ; but it has often struck me that with these historic old market-places the Crosses of our own Scottish"], [27, "The Old Cross Book- Stall. 13 towns may fairly stand comparison. The latter may not perhaps be able to compete with the for mer in atmospheric effect and brightness and variety of colour, but they not infrequently come pretty close up to them in picturesque outline of building, though they may have no Gothic Mins ter or great Dom for a background to set them off. Whether this is artistically true or not, there is one Scottish Cross in an old Ayrshire town which, as I knew it in boyhood before it was im proved by the worthy magistrates, is dearer to me than the quaintest of Continental market-places. Like them it is situated in the very heart and most ancient part of the town. A beautiful marble statue, closely surrounded by an iron railing, of one of its sons who, like Dick Whittington, rose to be Lord Mayor of London, stands in its centre. A few yards east from the statue on the lower side of the Cross, is a weather-beaten circular-shaped pump-well, with a glass lamp on its conical top, which never fails to present itself before my mind when I chance to be reading, \" A Rill from the Town Pump,\" in Hawthorne's \"Twice Told Tales.\" A little again to the south of the well a round granite stone looks up from among the darker causeway, and marks the spot where one of the"], [28, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 14 Covenanters suffered for having been engaged in the battle of Bothwell Bridge ; while around the open space itself are high old-fashioned houses \u2014 at least I thought them so in those days \u2014 with a judicious admixture of gable-fronts and more modern erections ; and as many as six streets lead into it. Standing in the middle of the Cross, at the back of the monument, where the fish and vege table barrows, and \" black-man,\" and \"vvulk\" and dulse stands have their quarters, and looking north, you see modern Portland Street ; and the narrow and tortuous Fore Street, with its delightful hud dlement of angles, and gables, and chimney-stacks, and outside stairs ; and crooked zig-zag Clerk's Lane, the birth-place of a new school of theology. On the west is Cheapside, more picturesque even than its London namesake, with its old-fashioned two-storey public reaching half-way across the thoroughfare, and above its dark thatch and crazy chimney the ancient steeple and whitewashed cor ner of the Parish Kirk. To the south is broad King Street, with the handsome spire of the Relief Church in the distance. And on the east, Water loo Street, just inside its mouth in perpetual sha dow on account of its narrowness and the height"], [29, "The Old Cross Book- Stall. 15 of the houses. Like one of those contradictions we sometimes meet with in human nature, it might be in continual mourning instead of rejoicing over the event it commemorates, which, momentous as that was, was still not so important in its issues to the human race as another little event of a less stirring, and entirely bloodless character, which happened thirty years before it, viz., the printing of the first edition of our national poet's works in the little room overlooking the narrow mouth of gloomy Waterloo Street. However precious these things are to the eye sight of my mind now, I don't suppose I ever thought much about them when a boy. It was never the artistic outlines and charm of perspec tive of this old Cross I revelled in then. That comes later, when you have been exiled from it for a time, and the once common and familiar objects, stimulated by experience and reflection, undergo a new birth. Whenever my thoughts in one of these favourite moments of reverie revert to the old place, with a stubborn conservatism I refuse to see any improve ments that have been wrought in its surroundings. Though the vegetable and other stands have some years since been chased into mouldy little shops"], [30, "16 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. by the orderly Magistrates, I still linger in their odorous neighbourhood as of old. The tempting gooseberries and glittering \" black-man \" may no longer be able to make my mouth water, but the talk and sly banter of the gossips is as palatable as ever to me. I still look on at the weekly sales of old furniture by the bluff auctioneer, sensible perhaps of a fuller enjoyment in their peculiar humour and bustle. I take a sentimental interest, too, in the rows of farmers' potato carts ranged on the early summer mornings across the open from the monument to the old pump well, at which I used to purchase our frugal dinner before I went to school. Around the lean and spectacled quack doctor in greasy black surtout and velvet skull cap, extolling the manifold virtues of his remedies, in front of his tiny table covered with little bottles containing monster worms and corns, may not hang so much mystery as of yore, but perhaps quite as lively an interest. I also feel a soothing influence \u2014 to which my boyhood was a stranger \u2014 in a momentary contemplation of the loitering gossiping manner, so characteristic of Scottish Crosses, and of this old one in particular, where there is n\u00abthing or nobody in a hurry, where once a week the burly farmers and their blooming wives"], [31, "The Old Cross Book- Stall. 17 and daughters congregate to sell the produce of their fields and dairies ; and where the common people gather out after work hours to talk politics and religion, as is their serious custom, or enjoy social intercourse with one another, there being more room there than in their small houses in the adjacent streets and lanes. I still stroll round the old place in these my favourite moods of fancy, renewing my acquaint ance with its well remembered phases of life, care less whether they yet exist or not, but I invariably end my stroll by sauntering up to old John Irvine's book-stall. It ranges from east to west on the south side of the monument, and may be said to belong to the general group of stands, the only difference being \u2014 a very important one, however, in its proprietor's eyes \u2014 that while the others sup ply food for the body his does so for the mind. It is an exceedingly primitive erection, consisting of a single board filled with second-hand volumes, and resting on two small black tressels, such as you might see tucked under the right arm of a village gravedigger wending his way to some rustic funeral, while he carries the mort-cloth under his left. You don't require to cast your eye down Cheap-"], [32, "18 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. side to see how the golden fingers are disposed on the dial-plate of the old church spire to know that it is between six and seven o'clock. The level sunlight lying aslant the old Cross, checkering the stands and human groups around them, would be quite sufficient to tell you that the sexton had rung the six o'clock bells half an hour ago, whose magic sound flings open the workshop doors, as the trumpet of Joshua laid low the walls of Jericho. But as good an indication as either of them is the preoccupation of the slim figure of the old book seller, attired in his thread-bare round-about brown velvet coat, almost the colour of the calf bindings on his own sombre volumes. He is bending over his dingy treasures, arranging and re-arranging them, as if in anticipation of expected visitors; for however dull and monotonous life proceeds at the stall during the day it always makes up for it on the long summer nights, when the true biblio maniacs, released from their labours, gather round him to turn over the leaves of his volumes in silence, and perhaps discuss with him some of their momentous themes. He has arranged them to his satisfaction at last ; lighted his pipe, and seated himself with a volume of his favourite Montaigne on an old box"], [33, "The Old Cross Book -Stall. 19 at the end of the stall to while away the remainder of the brief interval. Now that his face, which from its dull pallor you would say is not afflicted with too high living, is turned towards us, there are hardly enough seams and wrinkles in it to merit the familiar appellation of \" old \" generally prefixed to his name. Though he is still a few years on this side of sixty, the old-fashioned and shabby attire clothing his spare and slightly stoop- ing form, and the snowy-whiteness of his scant locks and ragged little whiskers clinging to the upper two-thirds of his wan cheeks, together, per- haps, with the ripe character of his conversation, may have earned for him this distinction, as they no doubt endow him with a certain antique and reverent air. His thin regular features, shaded by the brim of his old brown wide-awake, aslant which a sunbeam is basking, wear their habitual aspect of gravity. You would not, however, pronounce it the face of a rigid ascetic ; and there is too much kindliness beaming in the grey eye and lurking about the corners of the well-shaped mouth for a cynic. It is rather the face of a philosopher, whose unruffled serenity the conjugal infelicity of a score of years has been powerless to canker ; for, like that other philosopher of Greece, he is married to"], [34, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 20 a termagant who casts up to him, every day of his life, his incapacity as a man of business and a bread winner ; which, from the world's point of view, is perhaps no great libel, as he is neither ambitious nor pushing, and has no eye whatever to the main chance. To put, however, in the op posite scale against these shortcomings is the ex treme simplicity of his own few wants. He could be content to live, like Hamlet, in a nutshell, not to speak of a Diogenes tub, and even have every material want supplied to him in conformity with this straitened accommodation, if he was only allowed the society of books, the contents of which, in his wife's opinion, he is always more eager to talk about than to sell. Suppose we move nearer to the stall and take a look at his collection ? It is not large, nor does it present from time to time much variety. The sales being few, you may visit the stall to-day, and a week after find the same volumes whose faded leaves you had turned over at your former visit. Prominent at the top of the first row is Boswell's Life of fohnson, in four volumes, their calf bindings frayed and finger-worn, and their tarnished gold letters barely legible on the squares of faded scarlet morocco. Because Johnson's father kept a book-"], [35, "The Old Cross Book-Stall. 21 stall in Uttoxeter market, old John Irvine, \"in honour o' the callin',\" he used to say, always con trived to have his stall furnished with a copy of that gentleman's son's biography, though he de clared a library could no more be complete with out it than a kitchen could be furnished without a housewife's dresser and dels-rack. Boswell's Johnson is so full of good things that it may be ranked among the few books \u2014 of which the Bible heads the list\u2014 that you can never go wrong to open anywhere. I lift the second vol ume in my hand, and, of its own accord, it opens in the middle, where I read these words : \" Gold smith should not be forever attempting to shine in conversation ; he has not temper for it, he is so much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is composed partly of skill, partly of chance, a man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Goldsmith's putting himself against another, is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot spare the hundred. It is not worth a man's while. A man should not lay a hundred to one, unless he can easily spare it, though he has a hundred chances for him : he can get but a guinea, and he may lose a hundred. Goldsmith is in this state. When he contends, if"], [36, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 22 he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation : if he does not get the better, he is miserably vexed.\" Poor Goldy ! with all thy plain looks and th)' diminutive figure arrayed in the bloom-coloured coat which John Filby made himself famous in making for thee ; though thou wert the butt of the Gerrard street wits, we love thee better than the wisest of them for thy innocent and harmless vanities! Thy conversational feats and blunders never alighted with injury on any one's head but thine own, which is more than can be said for the majority of thy brilliant club-fellows. The first book which I ever possessed, bought with my own earnings, was an illustrated copy of thy works. I took it out in sixpenny monthly parts, each of which I devoured, woodcuts and all, several times over, long before the next issue appeared. Those first nights that I spent in the bosom of Dr. Primrose's good-natured family, laughing and crying with its members by turns \u2014 my mother interrupting me every now and then with an order to get to bed, \" an' no sit there howkin' your licht oot the as'hole,\" \u2014 were among the very happiest of my life. I remember as dis tinctly as if it was yesterday, when the work was completed, tying the twelve parts into a parcel and"], [37, "The Old Cross Book-Stall. 23 carrying them to Peter A , a swarthy, smooth chinned, agile little bookbinder in white apron and bib, proprietor of a small stationer's shop in the \" Toon-en',\" to bind them into a volume for me. Had I been a Muscovite plenipotentiary deciding with Peter the future fate of my countrymen, I could not have been more fastidious in debating with him the several conditions of its binding. It was to be ready in a week, but if it was nearer three before it was done, it was not for want of me presenting my fidgeting presence every two or three days at the counter of his little shop to remind him of his promise. The day I carried it home, a finished work of art, and put it in my em bryo collection, I was a proud boy. Ever since then it has remained, as in old Goethe's case, my earliest and latest love, sitting on the most impor tant shelf in my book-case, beside Shakespere, and Burns, and such other rare spirits, whose effigies keep him company in the poet's corner in West minster Abbey. Perhaps these circumstances, in which I made the acquaintance of the dear old vicar, and Tony Lumpkin, and what one might call their author's vagabondish Rip-Van-Winkleism in his biography, as much as my own individual sympathy, have a good deal to do with my love"], [38, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 24 for poor Goldy. To me he is like a very old friend, who has come all down the checkered path way of life, side by side, with me. I know the best and the worst of him, which is what cannot be said of a \"sprit-new\" friend. I am perfectly at ease in his company, never feeling constrained, as I am with some authors, to be on my good behaviour, or put my best foot forward, which is the true luxury of friendship, for he also knows the best and worst of me. And was there ever poet so kind in his dealings with that worst? His charity for the human weaknesses of his fellows is like a mother's for her offspring. When a boy I never could hear a word said against my hero's character without quarrelling with his traducer. Even at this soberer time of life, when one should have acquired a little of Dr. Johnson's philosophy, and be able to take things more coolly, I can never hear him called, spendthrift, vain, \" gooseberry fool,\" and such like, by my harder-headed friends, without losing my temper. The great lexicographer's words, looking up at me so wisely out of the sallow page of the volume of Boswell I hold in my hands, say in that case I am not fit, any more than Goldsmith, to contend with an adversary. Well, I don't doubt but that"], [39, "The Old Cross Book-Stall. 25 they are quite right, only it is so hard to change our natures by even the subtlest criticism of their defects. In affairs of character the boy will still shine through the wrinkles of the man in spite of the sagest of precepts and maxims for the guidance of his conduct, just as I saw the man foreshadowed last night in my little son, who was crying with vexation because Jeanie, the servant girl, affected to see nothing heroic in Sir William Wallace, whose exploits the young rogue has been stuffing himself with for a week past out of Scott's Tales of a Grandfather. Since then it would appear that I am no more able to make use of Johnson's wisdom at my mellow years than Goldsmith was in his checkered lifetime, I put Bozzy's wonderful volume, with its unconsciously life-like revelations of eighteenth century authorship, back into its place, and pick up another book jammed between an edition of Crabbe in modest drab cloth and a portly copy of Lord Byron. The one I have taken in my hand happens also to be an old friend, Dr. Currie's Burns. It is perhaps as awkward a compilation of the poet's works as ever was published. You could as easily find a needle in a hay-stack as the thing you want in its pages. Lamb, in describing it as c"], [40, "26 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. \" very confusedly and badly written, and inter spersed with dull pathological and medical dis cussions,\" has, in his own humourous way, hit off its character more prosperously perhaps than a more detailed and serious criticism would have done. But, in spite of the witty Elia's sarcasm, and even in view of the fact, brought to light since Lamb's day, that he tampered with the text both of his poems and correspondence, it is very dear to me, as it was from the \" well-meaning doctor's \" pen that I first learned the tragic story of Burns's life. I was lodging in the very city, Liverpool, where this brave-hearted \u00c6sculapius wrote his gifted countryman's biography. He had under taken the work, blessings on his kind heart ! for the benefit of the widowed Jean Armour and her orphan boys, because no literary person of any distinction could be got to risk his reputation in writing the life of such a questionable character as the Scottish Bard. As a physician he was at the time attracting the attention of the medical world and making his name famous by his treatment of fever with the cold douche, but who shall say he was not making it more famous still by his not less skilful and charitable treatment of the complex life of Robert Burns ?"], [41, "Tlie Old Cross Book-Stall. 27 I remember I used to mount away up to my bedroom after my day's work was done, light my candle, wrap myself in my great coat and muffler (for it was still springtime and there was no fire in the room), and sit down to the biography till my fellow lodger stumbled into bed after the Roscoe Arms at the street corner had closed. It may not have been right, but I used to feel that it was for tunate Tom had a little drop too much, as he would not be able to detect that I had been cry ing. I had not seen then either of these master pieces of Burns biography, Thomas Carlyle's, and Alexander Smith's, but I know when I read them some years after I did not shed half such fresh young tears as I did over Dr. Currie's more prosaic performance. But I am abruptly recalled from these reminis cences by the sudden consciousness of the presence of other visitors at the stall besides myself. Stand ing opposite me in dusty moleskin, is the beetle browed mason's apprentice taking lessons from the Schools and Schoolmasters, of Hugh Miller, while his companion at his side \u2014 Rab Deans' smithy grime newly washed from his swarthy face \u2014 per uses a tattered novel in mustard coloured paper covers. At the lower end of the stall, thumbing"], [42, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 28 what looks like an antique volume of sermons, is Jamie Alexander, the carpet weaver, usually styled, Alexander the Great, though for what reason I never could make out, unless it was because he had been at one time a soldier, and still carries his head, as the old bookseller used to say, like a cat carrying a herring. The tall, dreamy young man at my elbow, with hollow cheek, and sunken eye, and unshorn locks, and slovenly attire, you would think, judged by the canons of Rosalind's old re ligious uncle, had the very \"quotidian of love upon him,\" but it is only his profound student air, the result of keeping too close company with books. Davidson Dinglewood, for that is his name, is a charity schoolmaster, whose passion for reading is so great that he is quietly blamed for gratifying it even in the school at the expense of his young charge. He is a regular evening visitor at the book-stall unless when he is at the theatre. The drama being his favourite study, he has lifted a volume of Shakespeare and is deep in Henry the Fifth. At the top of the page he is reading is a rudely executed woodcut of the interior of the Boar's Head Tavern. Bardolph and Pistol \u2014 their faces full of comical despair \u2014 are seated at a table, and standing in a group behind them, with their"], [43, "The Old Cross Book-Stall. 29 backs to the fireplace, are Dame Quickly \u2014 the corner of her apron to her eyes \u2014 and Nym and Boy slobbering and crying over the death of Sir John Falstaff, the circumstances of which the good dame has just been recounting. \" That,\" says the old bookseller, who has laid down his pipe, and left his seat on the box, and joined his visitors, \" That's what I ca',\" looking over Davidson's elbow, \" extror'nar guid, 'and went away, an' it had been any christom child.' \" \" You mean the death of Jack Falstaff? \" asks Davidson. \" Ay, there's naething finer, or truer in the hale realm o' lit'rat're, sir,\" returns the old bookseller. \" He's nae langer the wutty, braggin', leein,' selfish auld rake.

Death's no the frichtfu' thing that ye wad imagine, man, ' death were less to be feared than nothing,' says Montaigne, ' if there could be any thing less than nothing.' ' Men fear death,' says Lord Bacon, 'as children fear to go into the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.' If I'm ever spared to write a book before I pay my debt to nat're, Jamie, it'll be on pop'lar fallacies concernin' deathbeds.\" \" What do you make of this, then?\" says David son ; \" it's from the same pen as wrote the account of Falstaff's death \u2014 ' The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment Can lay on nature, is a paradise To what we fear of death.' \""], [45, "The Old Cross Book-Stall. 31 \" Ay, what do you mak o' that ? \" seconds the carpet weaver, raising his head to its full military height, and moving closer to his adversary. \" O, I ken brawly whaur ye are,\" returns the undaunted bookseller. \" When Claudius spak thae words to his sister he wisna on his death-bed, but in the jail, in the best o' health, which mak's a' the diff'rence.

But, not so much perhaps as a triumph against the lexicographer as his confident biographer, I now pick up a well-worn copy ofthe Vicar of Wakefield, which I had before spied on the stall, and read with some pride the following passage of beautiful insight as its author's contribution to the discussion. \" Every new breach,\" says the patient old Vicar, addressing his fellow-prisoners on the subject of dying, \" that death opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with insensibility.\" \" The vera thing, my callan ! \" cries the old bookseller in high glee. \" Thae words o' Gold smith touches the heart o' the hale mystery.

But I never turn away from this picture of the old book-stall and its surroundings, in these my pleasant moments of reverie, without another pic ture presenting itself before my mind. It happened by-and-by that old John Irvine and his book-stall were not seen in the Cross for more than a week, and, though I had a wholesome dread of his angry wife's tongue, for I had been often at his house helping him home with his books of a night, and knew her ways, I ventured to call to see if he was ill.

If his reverence includes one so young as me in his invitation I am afraid I do not accept it ; for, though I stand up with the rest, my open eyes wander from one object to another. I notice the passing glint of spring sunshine rejoice the young leaves on the rowan tree in front of the kitchen window, then dance merrily into the kitchen and cover the devotional forms of the mourners with its blitheness ; but, as if discovering on a sudden it had made a mistake, it hurries out again, fol lowed by a passing black cloud and bitter shower of rain-drops on the window-pane. Perhaps I feel the opportunity favourable, when most of the com pany have their eyes shut, to feast my own open ones on my new clothes, this being the occasion of wearing my first jacket made by a proper tailor, and not by a woman.

Just within the newly opened iron gate, by the side of the little white cot-house built against the high wall, with its toy looking black Gothic windows and door, in which the gravedigger keeps the implements of his solemn craft, including other mysterious things which shall be nameless, is the figure of the gravedigger him self, standing, spade in hand, ready to head the procession to the spot of interment. Thomas H , or Tam, as this upholder of Adam's profession was always called, was a tall, strong-limbed, broad-featured man, dressed in a Kilmarnock bonnet and brown moleskin trousers and sleeved waistcoat, the same shade of brown as his own planks. In his shrewd Scotch face lurked a quiet vein of pawky humour, which received ad ditional emphasis from his nose, never one of the smallest, but now considerably enlarged from his inveterate habit of snuffing. Some months before the melancholy occasion of my first funeral my mother conceived a great dis like to the worthy Tam, and could never after wards abide him. While the twins were alive, but sickly in health, she and I used to carry one a-piece out for an airing in plaids. This girl's occupation,"], [66, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 52 as I considered it, was a dreadful heartbreak to my boyish pride, and was the cause of some sad teasing from my companions. \" Never mind them, man,\" my mother would say when I would be cry ing about it, \"ye'll mak' a' the better man for the woman that gets ye if ye're spared.\" Whether that has been so or not, is more a matter for Peg to decide than me ; but I know that it yielded me very small comfort then. At those times we gene rally strolled with our infant charges in the direc tion of the graveyard. The road to it was quiet, and less likely to be infested with malicious boys. Besides, it was a nice terminus to our walk, and we could sit down on some low mossy tombstone, starred with the kindly lichen, or on the green hillocks spotted with white gowans and golden kingcups, and take a rest. On those occasions Tam would sometimes leave the grave he was dig ging to join us, and enter into conversation with my mother. Like the first gravedigger in Hamlet, he could not only tell the particular spot where everybody was laid, but how long they had lain in the earth, and what they looked like the last time the grave was opened to let somebody in beside them ; as well as who they were related to for generations back. Tam delighted to talk about"], [67, "My First Funeral. 53 his subjects thus, adding many a sly remark and humorous reflection about their characters and doings when above ground, assured that none of them could rise and call him to account for his slanders. \" In the centre of a world whose soil Is rank with all unkindness, compass'd round With such memorials.\" The garrulous Tam could hardly be said to feel with the poet : \u2014 \" That 'twas no momentary happiness To have one enclosure where the voice that speaks In envy or detraction is not heard ; Which malice may not enter ; where the trace Of evil inclinations is unknown ; Where love and pity tenderly unite With resignation; and no jarring tone Intrudes, the peaceful concert to disturb Of amity and gratitude.\" Like all the true monarchial class he was ever desirous of adding to his subjects ; at least he got that name, and many were the stories told in malicious jest at his expense. One in particular, I remember, which my uncle A used to tell with his best manner, about a poor consumptive who lived in the parish of Riccarton which was separated from Tarn's only by a bend of the river Irvine. In going and returning from his work he"], [68, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 54 had to pass the gravedigger's door, when that worthy was sure to waylay him and inquire sym pathetically for his health. The poor man one day, exasperated, just as Tam was striding forward to make the usual crucial inquiries, with, as he thought, sinister designs, said to him before he could speak, \" Go you to h \u2014 1, Tam, I'm gaun to Riccarton ! \" and walked on, the inference, of course, being that he intended to be buried in his own parish. I can't exactly say how it came about, but I suppose he would be prosecuting his customary sympathetic inquiries about the health of the twins one day when we had them at the graveyard. \" They're twa bits o' weakly things, woman,\" was the remark he made, eyeing them narrowly, too narrowly \" for ony guid,\" my mother thought. It was enough for her, who was quite as keen in the sense as the irate consumptive. \" The great ogre has his e'e on my bits o' bairns ! \" she said, and we never carried them to the graveyard again till they went beneath his own mort-cloth. When they were lying in their little coffins in the darkened room she said bitterly, \"Tam H wad surely be happy noo, he had gotten them at last ! \""], [69, "My First Funeral. 55 As he stands in the middle of the roadway, in the bleak spring air, surrounded by shivering trees and shrubs, leaning on his spade and administering to his nose a pinch of snuff as we approach the graveyard gate, my mother's words come into my thoughts, and I fancy I can read the glow of satis faction mantling on the ogre's weather-beaten face. When we are within a few paces of him he shoulders his spade and, without speaking a word, leads the way to the place of interment. Already I see the great black wound gaping in the centre of the burying-ground a little to the right of the carriage-road. The red earth is heaped round its mouth and covered with planks for the convenience of the chief mourners. Standing on them by the side of my father, who, with glittering tear-drops in his eyes, puts a cord into my tiny hand, and gazing down into the dark pit, as I help to lower the coffins into their gloomy resting-place, my mind is perhaps more occupied with the novelty of the situation than the terrors of the tomb. Like Wordsworth's little cottage girl, '\u25a0' That lightly draws its breath, And feels its life in every limb: what should I understand of death ? Nor could I feel, like Claudius, the fearful thing it was"], [70, "56 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. \" To lie in cold obstruction and to rot ; This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod.\" If I am sensible of any feeling more than another, it has most likely been engendered by the past talk of the gravedigger to my mother, and is one of curiosity, mingled with a vague kind of dread lest I should see looming up through the blackness of the tomb, any of my long buried relations lying festering in their shrouds. We let go the cords, and with them our hold on all that is mortal of my twin brother and sister ; then we step down, my father I thought most reluctantly, on to the green sward, and the stalwart gravedigger throws the planks aside and commences to shovel the earth into the grave. As the rattle of the loose clods on the lids of the coffins grates on our ears my father winces visibly, and observes, as much to himself as to me, in words that seem to choke him, \" It's a blessin' yer mither disna hear't.\" When the grave is filled in, the company raise their hats and begin to move away, the constraint they had been under gradually, I fancy, dropping off them \u2014 accelerated, doubtless, by another brief but bitter shower \u2014 as they get farther and farther from the graveyard."], [71, "My First Funeral. 57 I don't think there was any unseemly burial feast at my first funeral, like what I have wit nessed at subsequent ones, where unharmonious jests and tales circulated with the tea and toddy.

I remember it was almost too much for mine. We had sat by the hearth, through the afternoon into the gloaming, as a be reaved family group, in a kind of dazed sullen sad ness, everyone seeming more afraid than another to break the ice in talk. \" I suppose,\" ventures my father at last, to the unspeakable delight of my sister and myself, and looking over into my mother's distracted face as he spoke, \" I'll pit the kettle on the fire, an' mak a cup o' tea ? \" \" I'm no needin' ony tea ? \" sobs she in reply. \" I think ye'll be the better o' a cup,\" returns he ; at the same time he rises and puts the kettle on the fire, after breaking the dead-looking piece of coal with the poker. \" Ye needna mak ony tea for me, it wadna gang owre my throat ! \" \" Ye mun try an' tak something, ye har'ly hae E"], [72, "58 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. tasted a bite o' onything for mair than three days, ye mun be sent, I'm sure, for want.\" \" Ma inside's ower fu' o' grief to fin' hung'r ! \" \" I tell ye ye'll bring trouble on yersel' if ye dinna eat something, an ye'll see what'll come o' us a' then.\" \" It wadna muckle maitter, I think, if a budy wis only to gang to a better worl' ; for, I'm sure, there's naething but trouble and sorrow in this ane. \" Come, come, na, lass ! it'll no dae to talk that way.

Give me, especially at a new year time, when you want to be happy and social, simple people, such as the world knew when I was a boy, where the feeling of neighbourliness overran like a wild flower into one another's houses, and was never considered an impertinence or an intrusion. Men and women had lots of time on their hands then, though the hours of labour were longer. A child could not be born, or a neighbour die, or a marriage take place, without those on the stair or round the doors taking as much interest in it as if it was their own affair. There were always plenty to sit with the sick, and carry them decently to the churchyard when they died : \u2014 such a thing as hurry-scurry funeral noddies, with that devil's own contrivance of the coffin-box swung beneath the carriage axles, to \" rattle his bones over the stones,\" not yet having been in vented.

I could wish for no better Hogmanay in this world than a thick slice of the old woman's rich currant bun sitting there on the table beside the New'r-day bottle; nor pleasanter entertainment than, as I eat it with childhood's keen relish, to gaze up into the dear familiar faces of the company, and to listen to their well-remembered voices prating like Master Shallow of \" the days that they have seen.\" \" They speak of many a vanish 'd scene, Of what they once had thought and said, Of what had been, and might have been, And who was changed, and who was dead.': The lean figure of Uncle John, sitting so jocosely in the old man's armchair, sipping his toddy, might indeed stand very well for that simple Gloucester-"], [82, "68 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. shire Justice of the Peace gleefully babbling of the time when he and the other swinge-bucklers of Clement's Inn lay all night in the windmill in St. George's Fields ; and his corpulent auditor, Uncle Airchie, listening at his elbow might be the pawky Sir John Falstaff, humourously replying, \" We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.\" Each vies with the other in recalling the wild freaks and pranks of their school and courting days.

But not before hanging up our stockings on the line against the chimney-board for the expected visit of the patron saint of all good boys and girls, in which category we hoped that our names were writ down, though not without some uncomfortable misgivings when we remembered certain little acts of disobedience against the maternal rule. The genuineness of this mysterious friend we never doubted for a moment. It never could have entered into our superstitious young heads \u2014 uncorrupted as yet by School Boards or nineteenth century enlightenment \u2014 as they lay on the pillows dreaming of the saint's venerable figure coming stealing in at the window or down the chimney, with his arms full of the very kind of presents we had been wishing and hoping for weeks past he would bring, that the gossips round the fire, whose laughter and talk"], [86, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 72 were breaking through our dreams like the sound of falling waters, were the patron-saints them selves. Perhaps it would not have been so good for us if it could. Life certainly would not have had the same relish for us but for this sweet tinc turing of superstition. If we were too sound asleep to hear the com pany break up, which it generally did after twelve o'clock had struck in the Relief Kirk steeple, and they had baptised the New- Year in a final mouth ful to keep out the cold on their way home, we were sure to be up betimes in the morning to examine our stockings. Carrying them back to bed with us, we lie awake turning their contents over and over in our delighted hands, comparing notes with each other, and impatiently waiting for the dawn to reassure ourselves with our eyes of their real character. A loud knocking at the door stops our garrulous tongues, and makes us dive with our booty deeper among the blankets.

He was a droll old creature, a widower, and lived with his only child, a young woman of"], [87, "An Old New Year. 73 twenty, on the stairhead with us. He was always in low water, calling himself, to borrow the favourite .phrase of Mrs. Gummidge, \" a lone lorn creetur,\" and making futile attempts to be happy. He used to drop into our house of a night, hoping, like Paul Pry, he didn't intrude, but giving as his reason, not like that inquisitive worthy that he was passing by, but that he was \" wae \" sitting looking from him \" wi' naething to speak to but the toom wa's.\" Drawing his chair up to the hearth at the invitation of the old woman, who welcomed him for his very foibles, he would smoke his pipe and pour out his tribulations to us on the subject of his employer, or his undutiful daughter. These two evergreen topics stood him instead of newspapers or books, for he never read any. If the strange behaviours and tempers of his master were to him past finding out, the ways and humours of his girl were in a still greater degree a perpetual puzzle to her unhappy sire. He was like a child in possession of a curious toy, whose complex organisation it cannot understand, and the more it tries to unravel the mystery the more bewildered it gets. His sage name, and how such a foolish person as he came by it, I remember, was about as great a conundrum to my precocious F"], [88, "74 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. boy's mind as his fearfully and wonderfully con structed Mary was to his. When the New-Year came round he resolved with all his strength to be happy, and put forth his mightiest efforts towards that end. There was something truly pathetic as well as highly comic in watching the poor man's endeavours, coupled as they were, with an evident nervousness lest they should miscarry. Hark ! he knocks at the door again !

This, as much for certain politic reasons as for motives of pleasure, was an annual custom with him on the first day of every new year. How freshly does the remembrance of those walks come back to me at this distance of time as I sit by my lonely city hearth to-night, holding high festival with the ghosts of the beloved past ! The clean dry roads as hard as iron with weeks of frosty winds, and the keen bracing air tingling in my boy's cheeks as I trotted along by the old man's side. Overhead the sky of sober blue and white, athwart which a troop of noisy crows is flying home to their rookery in yonder distant wood.

Sheeted burns and streams, voiceless, save where their blood-curdling trickle showed the ice had been broken to allow the cattle to drink. Aye, and the red sunsets gleaming through the naked wood, and just above the roofs by the side of the old church spire, as we again neared home, where the old woman has spread a second New-'r-day feast, and awaits our coming in the cheerful firelight. Ah me ! would that I could come, just for one brief hour, in my old similitude, and look on her dear face again. But I know that can never be save in some such poor broken-winged flight of imagination as I have been indulging in to-night. Well, well, I suppose I must not grumble. I have had my turn.

He would even be content, he thinks (for it is a closed burying-ground), if he could only be assured of finding a spot anywhere inside the walls where, haply, his son, grown to manhood, may come in his Sunday morning stroll, and live over again, as he stands by his father's grave, a passage out of the old home life, as he himself does now ; for do we not all plead guilty, according to our several characters, to the desire to live in the memory of the loved ones who come behind us ? \" The idea of our life to sweetly creep Into their study of imagination ; And every lovely organ of our life To come apparelled in more precious habit \u2014 More moving, delicate, and full of life, Into the eye and prospect of their soul, Than when we lived indeed.\" With these reflections still passing through his mind, and carrying a little bunch of groundsel in"], [107, "The Working Man's Sunday Morning. 91 his hand for the grey \" lintie \" which had so sweetly summoned him out of bed, he re-enters his home, now all astir with its newly-risen inmates, just as the tea-kettle is singing, in a nice low key, a psalm of gladness to itself.

The porridge-pot, with the \"spurtle\" looming out of the savoury mist, is not suspended over the fire this morning, making its customary music, \"blout \u2014 -blout, blout \u2014 blout,\" but the frying-pan, as if to add to the unlikeness of this day to any other, has usurped its place, and the loud skirl of the ham and eggs in it has drowned the low contented hum of the kettle.

In this lachrymose spring-time, while my household is agitated with the question, Where shall we go this summer for our holidays? my thoughts invariably revert to a little sea-port town on the west coast, opposite the island of Arran, which is designated by the unpoetic name of Beak, from the sup posed resemblance ofthe rocky peninsula on which it is built to the bill of a bird. The memory of this little seaport is particularly dear to me. It was here that I first beheld the sea ; and, though I have looked on more imposing stretches of ocean since, I have never been able altogether to disso ciate the idea from my mind that they were but a continuation of the collection of green waters beat ing on the rocks at the Beak. Here was the be ginning of my knowledge of the sea, and so, I can not get it out of my head that here also is the be ginning of the great watery waste that encircles the globe. The Beak is not one of those delightfully irre gular, \" reel-ral,\" topsy-turvy, higgledy-piggledy, mixtie-maxtie, little spots, clambering up from among rock, and shingle, and disabled boats buried bottom up in gravel and sand, to be met with on"], [115, "A School-boy 's Holiday. 99 the east coast, where red-tile, and moss-grown thatch, and weather-stained gable, and blue smoke curling upwards from crazy chimney cans against a sere and yellow background, and unkempt garden hedge, and tumble-down lichen-spotted dyke, and bark of silver birch, and knarled oak, and slender ash, glow in the sunshine like the confused miscel lany of colour on the artist's palette. It is not an artist's paradise at all. I don't remember ever to have seen or heard of one sketching it ; and I am not the least surprised, for it is the reverse of pic turesque. The houses, which are in straight rows and have slated roofs, are all one height, and shape, and colour. Round about it, day and night, murmurs a waste of restless sea, margined by miles of yellow sand, amidst which grow clumps of strong rush-like grass or bent. There are no trees or shrubs within a mile of the shore ; and even those beyond are stunted, and their bark bearded by the salt breath of the sea. The fields are not enclosed with hedges, but fenced by wire, or low whin-stone dykes as bare and bald as your loos. There are no lichen spots lacing their uneven granite sides, or patches of velvety moss fill ing their crevices, or delicate ferns or wild flowers peeping out of their fissures. There"], [116, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 100 is a commodious dock and break-water form ing the extreme point of the peninsula. It is not one of those primitive old-world wharves such as are to be seen in picturesque Holland, where the fat weeds have rotted for centuries, but a stoutly built modern quay, in which there are always some vessels discharging ballast and taking in coal or pig-iron. It is a dull, monotonous, sluggish place, the drowsiness of which is hardly awakened by the shunt-shunting of coal waggons and the whirl of the windlass. But it is a dear sweet spot in my boyish recollection for all that. Its straight lines and unartistic character never offended my eyes in those old days. It was then that I had my first attack of the sea fever, a disease most boys, I fancy, take in common with the measles and chicken pox, only it is much more protracted in its nature, last ing, it may be, for months, perhaps for years before the sufferer gets the turn. I was barely ten years of age when I sickened with it, and it never let my blood cool till I was a step or two into my teens. During that time this unromantic little sea-port, situated some 9 or 10 miles from my inland home, was the one paradise on earth for me. It filled my thoughts during the day, and flitted through my dreams at night. How eagerly I devoured stories"], [117, "A School-boy's Holiday. 101 of the sea and books of foreign travel ! I verily beiieve all the geography I possess at this moment, not to mention what I have forgot, was learned in this way. What hours I would lie awake in bed planning how I should run away like Robinson Crusoe, stow myself in the hold of one of the ships, and never come out of my hiding place till we were well out to sea, when it would then be impos sible for the captain to put me ashore. On the long summer Saturdays, when free from school, no lover ever set out with more ardour agitating his proud bosom to meet his mistress than I and two or three companions set out with our bare feet, and trousers buckled above our ankles, and our pockets stuffed with oat cakes and treacle scones, to greet the sea. In these busy, bustling years of advanced manhood, any one of the much coveted and greatly advertised circular tours on the Continent, by Cook or Gaze, would never stand a moment's comparison with those glorious Saturday holidays. We were padding along the country roads \u2014 how deliciously cool to our feet \u2014 before the sun had mounted high enough in the sky to scorch up the night dews with which the brown dust was saturated ; and what grand old country roads those were, with their bushy hawthorn and beech hedges, their"], [118, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 102 strips of cooling plantin', and their dykeside burns. I look across a gulf of forty years, chequered with every variety of human light and shade, and can see their individual features as plainly as on the day I first trod them. Down that narrow cart track, lined with broad deep ruts, and its right bank all aflame with yellow broom, I spy the white gable of the old flour mill, and can hear the eerie plash and drip of its water-wheel. Over yonder is the brickfield, with its smoking kilns, and long rows of unbaked bricks. There the cosy farm steading rejoicing in its clean white-wash, with the healthy odour of the empty cow-byre meeting our nostrils as we pass by, and the black and-tan collie barking at us from the middle of the paved yard, across which a stout country lass, in coarse drugget petticoat and pink-stripped short-gown, is carrying a \" gang \" of water. Peep ing out from amongst those stately beeches, and elms, and close shaven lawns, is the laird's much coveted mansion house. Sweltering in the sun is the old toll-house, the toll-keeper himself nursing his wooden leg on a low bench at the door, and chatting to an itinerant pedlar who has eased his pack from his back, and is wiping the perspiration from his forehead. Beneath the shadow of that"], [119, "A School-boy's Holiday. 103 tall elm is the wayside Inn, through the open par lour window of which are visible the burly figures of two farmers over a foaming tankard of ale. Sit ting on the rising part of the highway, amidst broken fences and well-worn hedge slaps, is a row of colliers' huts, with white-haired sunburnt un tidy urchins making mud pies in front of them, and strapping matrons lounging in the door-ways shading their eyes from the sun with their rough hands as they gaze after us padding along the middle ofthe road. On the summit of yon green hill stands the ruined castle of an ancient Scottish King, and by the foot of it nestles one of the pret tiest rural villages in broad Scotland. But the big thing, as our American cousins would say, in our walk, was going through the Glen \u2014 a secluded woodland pathway in the cleft of the hills behind the old king's castle, which brought us sooner to the shore, by a good mile, than over the hill road. Its sombre shade and deathly stillness, as we plunged into its mazes, inspired us with a feeling of awe and mystery, mingled with adventurous abandonment. Our boy imaginations identified it with the wild forest tales we had read, and our selves with their adventurous hunters and ex plorers. It was here, sitting on the trunk of some"], [120, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 104 fallen tree embedded in mossy turf, or on the red \" pining umbrage\" beneath a giant Scotch fir, that we had our first meal. At the bottom of the glen we got our earliest glimpse of the sea, with the Arran hills in the background, and Ailsa Craig looming phantom-like in the mouth of the Firth. How we quickened our steps, and finally broke into a run as we sighted the stile at the mouth of the Glen ! It was who to reach it first and climb its rustic steps, and, with a glad hurrah, greet the blue waters rolling in the sunlight still three long miles or more away. To feel their salt breath on our faces and in our nostrils was a delight that made our young blood leap for very joy in our veins. Our ardour was thoroughly aroused. No pauses now to look for birds' nests, or chase rab bits, or strange-coloured butterflies, as we trod the narrow footpath through corn and potato fields, and over sandy mounds covered with patches of heather and bent, till we reached the shore. The eager waves, their white crests glistening in the sunlight, as if sharing our passion, leapt up on the sand at our approach with a low murmur of de light. In our impetuosity we could hardly get undressed quick enough to embrace the tempting flood. How our blood tingled after the first"], [121, "A School-boy's Holiday. 105 plunge ; and how we relished our \" twal-oors \" when we came out, never stopping eating till we had emptied our pockets. But we were all impa tience till we got to the quay. This was our goal. Here we spent the remainder of the day gazing in admiring wonderment at the ships, enviously studying the strange life on their decks, and speculating as to which we would prefer sailing in. Sometimes we indulged in a little line fishing, lying all our length on the broad wharf, and staring down into the clear green depths among the star fishes, watching for a bite ; or we would play at young mariners for hours in some old disabled fishing smack lying half-way out of the water, hauling it up on the slippery beach, then shoving it off into the water again, with, you may be sure, our best imitations of sailor-like yo-hoes. We always returned, however, from these pastimes to feast our eyes on the strange vessels moored in the harbour, which was the thing nearest our hearts. When we were tired watching the sailors discharg ing ballast, or taking in their cargo \u2014 the mono tonous drudgery of which, I will not deny, perhaps cast a shadow over the romance of a sailor's life \u2014 we would saunter along to some vessel in which loading was already completed, or not begun. The H"], [122, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 106 clean-swept decks, tarpauling-covered hatches, and the fresh white paint on the bulwarks and deck cabin, relieved with grass-green mouldings, speedily lifted the shadow and restored our enthusiasm. The ships with the foreign crews, picturesquely attired in blue-striped guernseys, red cools, and long sea-boots, had most fascination for us. Their animated gibberish, probably because it was all a dark lantern to us, was more interesting than if it had been our own tongue ; and, accompanied as it was with its many-shaded gesticulations, made us fancy every moment they were going to draw the knives, sheathed in their belts, on each other. The black cook peeling the potatoes, or rinsing the dishes at the door of the galley, was likewise an object of absorbing interest to us, and we returned again and again to gaze on his glossy black skin and white teeth. So also was the old tar washing his shirt in the bucket, with a string of its companions drying above his head in the rigging, or the cap tain or mate leisurely pacing the deck, or sitting on a coil of ropes smoking a grotesque looking pipe, and toying with his dog. Such an incident as a vessel coming into harbour, or going out, was an event to be remembered. Smitten with the excitement of pilot and sailors, we rushed about,"], [123, "A School-boy's Holiday. 107 leaping over ropes and chains, now on this side of the quay, and then on that, to catch the best sight of her, fancying, doubtless, all the time, that we were participating in the coveted work. It was not until the sun had travelled well into the west, and its beams had lost their scorching heat, that we tore ourselves away from the Beak. The cravings of hunger, hitherto held in abeyance by the thoughts which the novel sights of the sea inspired, began gnawing with increasing violence at our tender young heart-strings as we turned our faces homeward. The sea biscuits, looking invit ingly out of the bakers' shop windows as we passed along the unpicturesque streets, were in high re pute with us, as much, perhaps, because of their difficulty of mastication, making a small piece of their granite substance go a long way in diverting the forces of the enemy, as because they were the food of the brave sons of Neptune. If the com pany was worth a copper, which was as unlikely as not, it was invested in this hardy fare, which would keep us munching till we had crossed the sand dunes, and penetrated half-way through the glen. The blithe sanguine mood in which we traversed the road in the morning was, like the landscape, considerably toned down on the return journey."], [124, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 108 But, however fitful and dispirited our march dur ing the last three or four miles, we always rallied ourselves when we came within sight of the town, which we entered just at the darkening. The sleepy old gloaming streets wore quite a holiday air from the dazzle of the newly-lighted shop windows, and the whispering lads and lassies strolling up and down the \" plainstanes,\" and the cleaned-up \" douce \" fathers and mothers doing their Saturday night's marketing. The sudden transition from the lone country road to the sweet security of human streets was like a draught of some refreshing cordial to our jaded spirits. With out lingering we passed along among the knots of garrulous idlers, each to his own fire-side, where the old man would be seated in his arm-chair, en joying his well-earned hour of leisure over his pipe and weekly newspaper, and the old woman making all things trig and clean against the coming of the day of rest. As we ate our farl of oatcake, washed down with a bowl of delicious milk \u2014 fit supper for an emperor \u2014 we rehearsed the marvels of the day. Then we bathed our bruised and burning feet in a tub of cold water, and retired with our wearied limbs among the blankets, where we were soon fast asleep, and dreaming of \u2014"], [125, "A School-boy's Holiday. 109 \" The black wharves and slips, And the sea-tides tossing free, And Spanish sailors with bearded lips, And the beauty and mystery of the ships, And the magic of the sea.\""], [126, ""], [127, "THE OLD PEW."], [128, "\" In my pew, and whilst the clergyman is going on, I think of the strangest things\u2014 of the tree at the window, of the congregation of the dead outside, of the wheat-fields and corn-fields beyond and all around.\" \u2014 Alexander Smith in Dreamthorp."], [129, ""], [130, "Through ths Cross."], [131, "VI.

Almost before I know, I hear the Sabbath bells ringing in my ears, and find myself marching by my father's side \u2014 a grip of his horny hand \u2014 up the main street to church. As we walk through the cross, thronged with the sober forms of worshippers passing and repassing each other, the houses on the low side of it, as if claiming their share in the day of rest, are lazily measuring their lengths on the sunny causeway, where the town pump \u2014 an object we youngsters had as much difficulty in passing as a thirsty toper a tavern \u2014"], [132, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 114 with the inviting crystal drop at its iron nose and its semicircle of wet slippery paving-stones, revels in their tall shadows. Next in view comes zig-zag crooked Clerk's Lane, with its admixture of low decrepit thatched houses, their white-washed walls grimy with weather stains, and their greasy dingy doorways filled with full-length portraits of Pat himself, in striped cotton shirt and clay-soiled moleskin trousers, smoking that sweetest of all pipes, the pipe of the day of rest ; while his vagabond offspring scamper in the gutter among the sun shine. Then the church, a plain square white washed edifice, with session-house and manse growing out at right angles from its side, fenced in a few yards off the lane with a high-railinged wall, divided in the middle with a great iron gate way ; and sitting on a three-legged stool in the centre of the open space is the plate for the cop pers, and the solemn deacon or office-bearer, standing a respectful distance behind it in front of a slate-coloured weather-beaten wooden erection, like a sentry-box in a barrack-yard \u2014 a shelter on the wet days.

There is the oaken pulpit, with its sounding-board overhead, high up between the two long narrow windows which overlook the open space in front of the church ; and the rail, as the worshippers called it, or circular passage running all round the base of the pulpit, where the precentor's desk was, and where nervous fathers stood up with their tiny offspring in their trembling arms to get the water on their faces ; and the enclosed table-pew, in the angle at the bottom of the pulpit stair, where the douce sawyer and his family sat ; and the oak painted side galleries, with the round clock-face in the centre, the provokingly slow fingers on the dial-plate of which we wearying youngsters used to watch, and wish they would only go a little faster, as if they and the sermon had some secret understanding with each other. The different clergymen who filled this antique"], [134, "116 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. pulpit, strange to say, have no place in my reverie; neither does the recollection of the particular theo logical views they preached from it move me any more in these moods than did my boyish prayers the fingers on the face of the obstinate old clock in the side gallery. It was a common occurrence to behold old Calvin \u2014 especially if a young divine was the orator \u2014 beat till he was as black as the preacher's own coat ; which the fathers and brethren of the body, as appeared from their laudations of the orator on their way home after sermon, enjoyed with as much zest as the lovers of the manly art of self-defence do a round of fisticuffs in the prize ring. But these exhibitions never stirred my young blood. I had far more sympathy with the merry laughter of the children that came floating in at the open windows of the church, between the falls of the good man's voice, from the lane, or the backdoors of the surrounding houses ; and uncon sciously envied them their vagabond freedom, though I as consciously regarded them as in the same benighted condition as the Jews, or other heathen we subscribe our shillings to convert. I say, I never, when in fancy I take my seat in the old pew, think about the ministers, or the fer vour, or lucidity with which, in season and out of"], [135, "The Old Pew. 117 season, they expounded their own peculiar theolo gical views. Indeed, this youthful indifference grows stronger as I grow older ; and at this moment, with the snows of age whitening my pow, I am naughty enough to suspect that the preaching of views, however enlightened or substantially founded, is like a lot more things in this world, sub ject to change ; so that what may be the orthodox beaten highway to heaven in our day, will be like the old disused tram-roads still extant in some parts of the west country, overgrown with the mosses and weeds of forgetfulness in our children's. I say, when I take my seat in the old pew, it is not the preacher and his gospel that bulk most in my eye, but the worshippers \u2014 now dead and gone most of them \u2014 who sat round about me, and whose familiar features I can recall with more vividness than many of those of my own relations. First, there was the baker, who halved the pew with us. If anything could add to the irksome ness of our imprisonment, it was the near presence \u2014 almost a kind of omnipresence \u2014 of this clean shaven, always-in-his-place, no nonsense parent of well-drilled children.

There was no visitor's book kept at the castle, but these mural records veining the dingy stone and plaster, most thickly in the neighbourhood of the broad window-sills, which offered a convenient seat for the whispering of amorous vows, told, without the trouble of turning over leaves, their own tale. They also showed how dear the remembrance of the old place was to those exiled sons and daughters of \" Auld Killie \" who, on returning home after long years of absence in the colonies, had repaired hither to inscribe their names anew, or, with dim and misty eyes, trace"], [148, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 130 out the once familiar signatures, now alas ! many of them little better than a veritable bead-roll. Being a professed sentimentalist myself, there is little marvel if the haunting presence of this ancient castle should have exercised a spell over my boyhood's days, which but increases in potency the older I grow. A \" flash upon that inward eye which,\" the poet declares, \" is the bliss of solitude,\" \u2014 a glance from the wrinkled features of this picturesque old pile of red sandstone, with its great broad solitary staircase, flanked on each side by circular projecting towers, \" adorned with ropes of twisted stone,\" is more rejuvenating to me at any time than was the draught the senile Dr. Faust drank at the bidding of Mephistopheles. As, in memory, I ascend its time-worn steps, and pass through the heavy, iron-studded, oaken door (above which are sculptured curious heraldic devices), into the paved court, where a melancholy yew flings its sombre shade over the crumbling walls and dilapidated chambers of what was once the birth-place of a lady whose descendants have been destined to fill, first the Scottish, and after wards the throne of Great Britain, to the present time, a host of youthful associations crowd in upon my mind. For one thing, it was the subject of"], [149, "A Pile of Red Sandstone. 131 my first, and, if I am not mistaken, my last essay in oil-colour painting in my boy drawing-school days ; and that may be one of the reasons why I cherish it with such peculiar affection. I shall never forget the shock of real grief my feelings sustained on revisiting, after a lapse of years, this scene of my first essay in landscape art. The rowan tree that used to be loaded with scarlet berries ; the tall, graceful birch ; the slender hazel, \" with milk-white clusters hung ; \" together with a whole wayward family of trailing, creeping, inter twining leaves and branches, which made a living screen in front of its antique masonry, where the dappled lights and shadows nodded to the whisper ing of the leaves, were all cut down ; and the old, moss-grown, lichen-stained walls \u2014 a perfect mine of colour \u2014 green, and blue, and purple, and yellow, and silver-gray, were all scraped and pointed anew with horrid prosaic white lime. Happily in this drawing, now adorning my study wall, and made before the ruthless hand of the destroyer admitted the garish light of the \" intrud ing sky\" and banished for ever the spirit that dwelt in this sylvan bower, I can still see it as it looked in the days when I sat before it lovingly reproducing its features on canvas ; and even feel"], [150, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 132 a touch of the old, strange awe with which the loneliness and desolation around used to impress my boy's spirit. But if this artistic pastime helped to make me in love with the outside of the old castle, a bundle of fireside legends, and the perusal of an old family chronicle, supposed to have been written about the year 1657, made me doubly so with its interior. Whenever I felt tired painting, or when the weather became unfavourable, I would betake myself to the inside, where, loitering amid the ruin and desolation of the past, I frequently forgot all about the shower, and my picture too, till some incident recalled me to myself again. Indeed, after I had thrown my painting craze aside for another (for, as a boy, I never was long without a hobby of some sort ; at least, such was my mother's opinion), many a pilgrimage I made on the pleasant summer Saturday half-holidays to the old place, alone or in the society of a congenial companion. I was never tired on those occasions, wandering up and down the narrow, echoing stairs, and rambling out and in among the broken and crumbling ruins, and feeding my young fancy in the dusty, cob webbed chambers, where men and women had once died, and where children had been born, and"], [151, "A Pile of Red Sandstone. 133 had played and tumbled on the decaying floors creaking beneath my tread. Those forlorn, twilight rooms, with the moth-eaten wainscot peeling off their walls ; and their curiously-carved oaken wardrobes and presses, and heavy antique dining tables and chairs, staring so quaintly at me, would again become peopled with the gallant knights and ladies gay who had fumbled in their locks and drawers, and filled their seats, and feasted at their boards, the flowers of gold adorning their velvet cloaks and silken petticoats shining in the dusky light like glow worms lighting their nightly fires. I loved to picture to myself the knight whom the historian says Alexander the Third rewarded with a military girdle \u2014 investiture of knighthood \u2014 for his deeds of valour at the battle of Largs ; or him who was slain at Berwick ; or Robert, the \" ne'er-do-weel \" of the family, who is spoken of as \" ane man black hared and of ane huge large stature,\" that wasted his days frequenting the court in the minority of King James the Third ; or that other who was killed at Flodden with King James the Fourth ; or the hornbook of the family, who was \" of a meek and gentle spirit, and delyted much in the study of phisick ; \" or the sportsman, whose passion was \"hunting and halking.\" But"], [152, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 134 of all the members of this noble family, next to the warriors who had died in battle, the knight who perhaps interested me most was Sir William, the poet, who is the author of an MS. metrical translation of Virgil's \" Dido and \u00c6neas ; \" an entire version of the Psalms in Scotch, also in MS. ; and other smaller pieces of a religious and amorous character, as well as the \" Historie and Descent \" of his own house. The kirk, or long garret at the top of the build ing, where the persecuted Covenanters used covertly to listen to the fervid utterances of their hunted ministers, also possessed a strangely solemn charm for me. Had I been treading the groined aisles of some grand old historic cathedral, lined with the crumbling sculptures and effigies of the departed great ones of the earth, I could not have felt more deeply awe-stricken than I did standing beneath the naked rafters, black with age, of this dim and dusty garret, eyeing the fragments of moth-eaten oak stools, scattered up and down the broken floor, on which the stout worshippers used to sit during service. I don't remember now whether this apparent disregard of bodily comfort evinced by the stoical Covenanters heightened my venera tion for them, or that I even compared their dis-"], [153, ""], [154, "Pile of Red Sandstone"], [155, "A Pile of Red Sandstone. 135 regard of bodily comfort with the scrupulous attention of our modern worshippers to these things.

A man listening to the Gospel with his hand on the hilt of his sword is likely to be pretty careless whether he has a cushion to his seat or not. Or I would wend my way to the kitchen, on the ground floor of the castle, whose huge, furnace-like fireplace, above which swung a ponderous iron crane, never failed to excite my boyish curiosity and wonderment. It bore evidence of having been converted at some time into a sort of smithy, and, to speak the truth, it always looked in its trans formed state, to my imagination, more like the place where Vulcan himself might have forged the armour those valiant knights wore who were slain at Berwick and Flodden, than an ancient culinary establishment, where they were in the habit of roasting a whole deer at a time. On the same level with the kitchen were the dungeons, whose low, vaulted, gloomy interiors I always found a weird fascination in exploring, even at the risk of stepping on a toad or being startled by a rat.

Sometimes, however, like the author of A Sentimental fourney, these fancies became too strong for my young nerves, and, overwhelmed with a mixture of fear and horror, I would make an ignominious retreat into the securer light of open day.

And if my passion was never inflamed, like his, by hearing her sing a love-song, I can honestly say it suffered no dis enchantment from a chance criticism she once dropped about the iron nails which studded the oaken door of the castle being a striking likeness. I don't know that I understood, any more than our fifteen-year-old bard, how it was that this little sunburnt maiden filled such a large space in my boy's world, rose-colouring all the dull light of my common days, stealing into my dreams at mid night, and flitting through my sentimental mus ings on this ancient castle, to which I was sure to find my willing feet a-pilgriming again at the first idle opportunity. It never, indeed, occurred to me to inquire how it came about that the vision of her rustic form, tripping it o'er the gowany holm behind her meek-eyed charge, had so suddenly changed the prose of my life into poetry. But I suppose I was too happy to think of indulging in analysis ?

Her broad stooping shoulders are attired in a faded harness plaid, pinned under her chin with a brooch containing a lock of her dead husband's hair \u2014"], [170, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 150 these adornments being too great a work of art to lightly think of taking them up and down in the brief interval between the preachings. She was quite a character, and, like most people so desig nated, was a great talker. Her particular forte, I remember, was genealogy. As the different items of the week's news came under review, Jean, in variably set about discovering the pedigrees of such persons as had become public property, for the time being, through entering upon the married state, or adding to the number of their offspring, or contracting a disease and dying, which, with an \"a-tweel-a-wat\" in every second mouthful of words, she traced back \u2014 not always, it must be confessed, in a very direct line \u2014 till they were lost in mist, if, indeed, as the slightly-bored old man sometimes thought, and said too, after she was gone, they were not lost there before she started. Then there is the lithe, nervous figure of the old woman herself, her dark hair, though now a \"sabled silver,\" still retaining some of its old wavy charac ter where it is parted above her low forehead. The tinge of red on the tops of her cheeks wears its old dusky glow. About her mouth, now slightly fallen in through the loss of her teeth, is lurking as much fun as ever. Her nose, too \u2014 her shabby little up-"], [171, "Betzveen the Preachings. 151 turned nose, with its miraculous scent \u2014 is charac ter itself, more eloquent sometimes than her tongue. And her eyes : what a vivacity is in those keen grey eyes ? How they would twinkle with merri ment, or flash with sudden anger at the rehearsal of some meanness, or, at the bidding of a contrary emotion, dissolve as suddenly in a shining mist! She is still too proud, though, to be indebted to glasses, and cherishes, as provokingly as ever, her favourite half-belief that those who wear them do it more from affectation than necessity. Even when baffled in the threading of her needle \u2014 not such an uncommon occurrence now \u2014 and she con descends in her despair to try the old man's, they, as they give her no help, but strengthen her in her prejudice. She is too young in spirit to brook tamely the idea of the body's decay. She bustles about as light on her feet as a fairy, spreading \"scones\" thick with jelly, and pressing them with as much heartiness as if they were cakes of \" blithe meat,\" particularly on Jean and her niece's young man. This bashful youth was always one of the party at their \" twal-hours,\" sitting nervously on the edge of the oak-painted chest standing in the window space. Since he was obliged to be on his good"], [172, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 152 behaviour before folk, he generally contrived to give vent to his amorous feelings by abstractedly stroking the back of the tortoise-shell cat, or scratching the venerable head of the one-eyed ter rier, with whom he shares his \" twal-hours \" for so kindly condescending to act as his substitutes. At least, so the roguish youth sitting in the shadow behind old Jean's chair, devouring with much relish his \"twal-hours\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\" at the same time, under cover of studying the Shorter Catechism, used to say when he wanted to tease his big cousin. Her sedate ladyship, who had just been relieving the old woman of some of her household cares, takes her place among the group as far from the chest as possible, thereby demon strating, by that strange contrariness in lovers' natures, shall vve say, her greater nearness to it, and hearkens the demure little maiden on the low stool by her father's chair, her paraphrase. The old woman, however, is the life and soul of the whole company ; keeping up the conversation when it offers to flag, and rescuing it from dulness when, as not unfrequently happens, it is in immi nent danger from that cause. Like the godly minister she sat under, being more of a moralist than a theologian, she always contrived to bring"], [173, "Between the Preachings. 153 away something from the sermon which just fitted to a nicety the particular phase of experience she happened to be passing through at the time, either in her own person or that of her neighbours. The varied service she would press this single idea into, and its apparent marvellous fitness for the office, was a constant theme of wonder to her less inge nious lord and master. These little rubs of caustic, whenever the occasion presents itself, and the gar rulous Jean pauses to take her breath, or a bite of her \" scone,\" or to arrest, in hot haste, a blob of jelly before it slides over the edge of her piece on to her gown, she courageously applies\u2014 usually with a dash of humour \u2014 to her own moral sores, or those of the human family in general ; she is not the least particular. The constant effect of these sallies is the upsetting of Jean's train of ancestral calculations, when, to the old man's horror, she begins them all over again till some fresh stroke of humour or satire from the old woman's quiver puts her forces entirely to flight and compels her to take a new tack. \" An' hoo do ye think ye're gaun to like your new minister?\" asks the old man, just as Jean is rallying from her last discomfiture. \" 'Deed, I'm sure, a-tweel-a-wat, an' I dinna L"], [174, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 154 ken,\" replies Jean. \" They say the chiel's clever, an' it may be ma blin'ness that canna see't ; though I'm nane that blin' but I can notice that he uses the paper.\" \" He reads 't, does he ? \" \" Every word o't, a-tweel-a-wat, an' daurna lift his een aff the book-board for fear he losses the place.

The youngsters shut their Bibles and catechisms, in which they had been rehearsing the Sabbath-school lessons when they did not happen to be listening to Jean's harangues. The old folk break off their talk, and, shaking the crumbs from their laps, rise to their feet. For the next few minutes all is hurry and bustle. The pile of Sunday finery on the bed is transferred to the heads and backs of their several owners, who now step out to church \u2014 the bashful intended and his lady-love, not the least daunted by the dismal side of the matrimonial picture held up for their edifi cation, taking the lead ; and the old woman bring ing up the rear, after locking the door on the not overly-well-pleased dog and cat, and concealing the key under the bass.

At anyrate, I know it is the same vanity in my character which made me hang Paul Chalmers' \" Legend,\" as a pictorial representation of the occupation of my own idle moments, in the place of honour above my study-mantelpiece, that makes me suspend my literary relation on the same line at its left-hand side. As a work of art it may not amount to a great deal, being only a dingy little three-quarter length photograph in an oaken Oxford frame, and lack ing, of course, the substance, the dignity, the aris tocratic air, if you will, of a portrait painted on canvas and mounted in superb gold. But the"], [182, "162 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. lineaments of the old gentleman's portly figure, as he sits in an easy, half-reclining attitude, are, never theless, all there, and could not have been rendered more true to the life had the late Sir John E. Millais been the limner, instead of the sun's rays. I can myself supply the rich florid colour to his fine Scotch face, with its clean-shaven lip and chin, its mouth drawn slightly down at the corners, which always gave him, to us youngsters at least, a cross, ill-natured expression \u2014 its full blue eyes, and ample forehead, crowned by snow-white locks of curly hair, of which his bushy whiskers were a continuation. These are the self-same half-dress garments he always wore at such times as he went up the street \u2014 not tight-fitting or dandiacal, but easy and roomy, and full of deep lurks and folds whenever he sat down, just as he is doing in the photo grapher's chair in the picture. The last two but tons of his capacious waistcoat are left unfastened, and would not have been his had it been otherwise. And that was the style in which the limp loose ends of his black satin neckerchief always lay on his modest bit of white shirt breast. He is an uncle of mine \u2014 a minor poet and man of letters \u2014 the only one of that scribbling frater nity, so far as I know, who ever belonged to our"], [183, "A Literary Relation. 163 family, either on the one side or the other ; hence the store I set by him, and the prominence I give to his picture above my mantelpiece (though it does not come up to the idea of what \" The Auto crat of the Breakfast Table \" says a family portrait should be), and relegate such literary lions as Thomas Carlyle and George Eliot to more obscure portions of my study walls. He is the author of a very excellent, almost model local history, which passed through the fourth edition shortly before he died at the ad- vanced age of eighty-two years. His only other prose work, with the exception of a few sketches, is a dialogue between Burns and some of his Kil- marnock friends in a public-house, which was, I am afraid, the reverse of a success, as his genius was not dramatic. It was, certainly, an act of consider- able literary daring, more creditable perhaps to his simplicity of heart than the complexity of his intellect, to set a-talking this brilliant conversa- tionalist, of whose speech it is recorded that it not only took Edinburgh society by storm, carrying witty Duchesses off their feet, but that the very waiters and ostlers forsook their warm beds in the middle of the night to come under its spell when ever it became known that he had arrived at an"], [184, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 164 inn. In any case, it was a risky thing to set the tongue of this bewitching talker a-wagging in a convivial gathering of such worthies as John Gou die, Tam Samson, and Robert Muir, and was cer tain to be a failure in the hands of a much defter man of letters than my uncle's. The pity was that he could not see this for himself, more especially since he had already written some verses, showing a rare appreciation of Burns's worth as a man and his genius as a Scottish bard. He is also the author of a little volume of poems and songs, humorous and sentimental, which passed through two editions. One or two of these songs have been set to music, and taken rank among that great body of lyric poetry which is the com mon food of the Scottish heart. The first time I heard one of his songs sung in public affected me much the same as if I had been the author of it myself. The artiste was a poor ragged woman, and she was singing it for bread in the back court of a block of tall city houses, many a mile from where its author lived. This was, indeed, true fame ! Oliver Goldsmith's heart could not have been more elated with the pleasant wine of an author's vanity as he followed, in his student days, the ballad-singers on the streets of Dublin singing"], [185, "A Literary Relation. 165 his own songs, than mine was that day on hearing this poor ragged woman lilting with her cracked voice the lines of my author-uncle's song. For a literary life, embracing a period of fully sixty years, and blessed with exceptional health, the above record of literary achievements may look small. But it must be remembered that he was a slow man, and lived, moreover, in a sleepy Ayr shire town in the days of \"fine old leisure.\" Be sides, literature was more the occupation of his spare hours than the daily business of his life. In his youth he was bred to the loom, but, feeling it irksome, he forsook it for basket-making. Nor did he continue long at that. Finding it as uncon genial as weaving, he changed it for book-binding, which calling he pursued, in conjunction with the care of a circulating library \u2014 his own property \u2014 and the sale of newspapers and general stationery in a little shop at the lower end of the less busy part of the main street of his native town. He likewise, in the season, sold gooseberries and apples and pears grown in his own garden ; for he had a true poet's love of gardening, and I am doing him no more than justice when I say that he always found infinitely more pleasure in rearing his fruit than in exchanging it for money. Many"], [186, "166 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. an hour he spent tending his trees and his flowers, in this little Eden of his, which he kept with the utmost neatness and care ; and here, also, amid its quiet and seclusion, he came to woo the shy muse, composing, in his little arbour, some of his happiest verse. Such, at least, was his union of employments at the date to which my boyish recollection goes back, and sketches his corpulent figure in white apron and bib, with florid complexion and snowy hair, standing in his little shop door, with his hands in his trouser pockets, \"puffing contentment from his lips,\" or gossiping with customers at his coun ter, or binding books at his bench by the window, screened from the curious gaze by a double tier of newspapers and illustrated journals, neatly arranged on two strings extended from shutter to shutter behind. This latter branch of his business was never of a very extensive character, being chiefly confined to repairing his library books, for which it came in very handy. He did, however, occa sionally bind new books, and that too in a manner, for thoroughness and solidity, that would have re joiced the heart of even the Chelsea philosopher, as my father's family Bible, two volumes of \"Cham bers' Information forthe People,\" and a \"Walker's"], [187, "A Literary Relation. 167 Dictionary,\" still in good condition, can abundantly testify. His little book-shop, like Tom Davies's in Russell Street, Covent Garden, in Johnson's and Goldsmith's day, was a general lounge for all the lit terati of the town. The stalwart U.P. minister, who was the author of a little booklet of verse entitled, \" Scenes of Youth Revisited ; \" the parish minister, who was an excellent judge of a good story, and, it was said, perhaps because of his rosy.yettruly human countenance, a glass of Scotch whisky ; the school master, who was a \" stickit stibbler \" like Dominie Sampson, and a perfect walking encyclop\u00e6dia of knowledge, only he must unravel it in his own de tailed, day and date fashion \u2014 he could never con dense a story, or tie up its salient features in a few well-chosen words ; the passionate Doctor B , who had the reputation of being addicted to alcohol and profane language, and the best setter of a broken limb, or amputator of a useless one, in the whole country side ; the local landscape painter, from whom I received my first lessons in drawing, and who furnished the dining-room walls of the town and country gentry with views of the scenery of their own beloved shire- \u2014 these worthies, with an odd specimen of the voracious reader and the radical politician, were frequently found block-"], [188, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 168 ing up the little space between the counter and the shop door ; or the more favoured of them would be invited into the little parlour behind to carry on the talk under the kindly stimulus of a dram and a fragrant pipe of tobacco. I was too young then to remember any of their talk, to which I was frequently a clandestine listener, being chiefly about books and authors ; but I have a very vivid recollection of the talkers themselves, and mighty heroes and intellectual giants they were in my juvenile eyes, which viewed them almost with a kind of superstitious awe. Even now, after a personal acquaintance with some of them, and my critical faculty fully developed, I am unable, such is the strength of early impres sions, to divest my mind altogether of its youthful reverence. Woe betide the unsophisticated urchin who came during these learned colloquies in the little space between the counter and the shop door, or the little back parlour, for a pennyworth of paper and envelopes or a half-pennyworth of apples ; or the customer for a book out of the library, and could not make up his or her mind quickly which one to have, if old Betty, his wife, was not at hand to serve them."], [189, "A Literary Relation. 169 She was a little, thin, shrivelled, sallow-featured, timid woman, who, like Jeanie Welsh Carlyle, acted as a kind of buffer between the world and her bad-tempered lord, as well as between him and his nephews. As children we were always frightened of him. Like that formidable \"old bencher of the Inner Temple\" Elia so pleasantly resurrects for us, he \" made a solitude of children wherever he came, for they fled his insufferable presence as they would have shunned an Elisha bear,\" a cir cumstance all the more remarkable, perhaps (and making my riper judgment somewhat sceptical of the accuracy of my early impressions), when it is considered that of all his poetical pieces, those dealing with child life are destined to have the greatest longevity. My aunt, too, I remember, rather strengthened our bad opinion of him by the way in which she acted. If she slipped us a few gooseberries, or a copper at a Fair time, it was always done furtively, and with the whispered in junction, \" Now, don't let on to your uncle, or .\" I don't know that she ever completed the inference, but we were deep enough, young as we were, to do it for her. It may only have been a poor humour of hers to put things in this light ; or a morbid craving for sympathy may have, consciously or M"], [190, "170 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. unconsciously, prompted it ; for she was of a com plaining disposition, and generally went, among her relations, by the name of the \" cheeper.\" Whatever were our elders' feelings towards her, we youngsters, at least, pitied her much as we did the beautiful captive princess in the giant's black marble palace of Arabian Nights' fame ; and I should not be at all surprised if our enthusiastic young imaginations played the role of Prince Codadad for her deliverance. Poor \u2014 I was going to say hen-pecked \u2014 Betty, but that would be a confusion of genders ! There is little wonder if she felt lonely sometimes, and craved for more sympathy than her husband and his literary friends perhaps gave her. She had been the mother of a large family, all of whom died in infancy with the exception of one son, who was married and lived at a distance ; and even towards him, it was understood, she had to lavish her affection surreptitiously. The only reason I could ever discover for this particular dryness between father and son \u2014 unless the ridiculous one, I have heard stated, that he had married a woman with Irish blood in her veins \u2014 was, that while his mother generally spoke of him as \"our Willie,\" his father invariably talked of him as that \" chiel,\""], [191, "A Literary Relation. 171 which may, after all, only have been his Scotch way of concealing his paternal feelings. All the same, this seeming estrangement between father and son, in spite of these explanatory reasons, always presented itself in the light of a conundrum to my boy's mind, which, after cudgeling my brains for a little, I generally gave up, as the children say when playing at guesses. The stand ing inconsistency, however, between the sentiment of his poetry and his acted life, though also par taking of the nature of a mystery, was not so readily relinquished by my seniors. Indeed, this was a theme my mother and aunts frequently waxed eloquent on, especially if the one or the other of them had a crow to pluck with him for some supposed slight or want of consideration, though, sister-like, they would never hear a word from anybody else against him. The saying, \" a prophet has no honour in his own country,\" becomes truer and truer the nearer you reduce the idea of country into its original elements, receiving its most perfect fulfilment in the family circle ; for no man is a hero to his brothers and sisters any more than to his valet. I have heard it said that you should not even be too familiar with your minister or your doctor if"], [192, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 172 you wanted the prayers of the one or the prescrip tions of the other to possess any remedial value over either your soul or body. It is the fewer number of us who are fit to be entrusted with a peep behind the scenes. A glimpse of Hamlet in his dressing-room quietly quaffing a mug of beer just after hearing him, in a freDzy of hysterical language, order the horrified Ophelia to a nunnery ; or Lear complacently smoking a cigar with his legs crossed, after hearing him exclaim, on the discovery that Regan is about as good at bandying hasty words, scanting his sizes, and opposing the bolt against his coming in as her sister Goneril, \" Oh, fool, I shall go mad ! \" as he passes bare-headed out into the storm, would, I fear, be fatal to their further influence over the most of us. It is much the same thing, I presume, with poets. In their creations we are accustomed to see them in their moments of inspiration, strung up to the highest point of tension, though the laborious steps by which they may have climbed to that elevation are hid from us ; and we are completely disillusionised on beholding them with the pegs set down. At least, I know such was the case with my literary relation and his near kindred."], [193, "A Literary Relation. 173 With their naked acquaintance with the prose side of his life, so full of human failings and short comings, they felt as if his poetry was all a make believe. They forgot that it was a much easier thing to write a poem than to live one, or rather that they were two entirely different things. No amount of reasoning could induce them to dis sociate the artist and his work. They persisted to the last, at every new illustration of his supposed selfishness, or surliness, in holding up his poetry to condemn his life, and his life to give the lie to his poetry. In standing up for this literary relation, in whose genius I felt a pride even in those early days, I frequently incurred the displeasure of my parents. Once in particular, I remember, I was severely rebuked as a wicked blasphemer for re minding them that Christ's brethren thought him a big humbug too, probably for no more philo sophic reason than because, like them, they had slept in the same bed and eaten at the same table with him. But such has always been the contemptuous fate of genius at the hands of familiarity. Perhaps the most famous instance of modern times is that of Thomas Carlyle. His own reminiscences and his wife's letters put the public in much the same"], [194, "174 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. position as blood relations, and it made as frank and foolish a use of its privilege as such relations usually do. I believe if Shakspere had been simple enough to write such candid reminiscences, or Ann Hath away had preserved her own and her husband's letters, as did Jeanie Welsh, the likelihood is that we would have discovered his kinsfolks' and fellow townsmen's ideas of his poetry were governed pretty much by his daily matter-of-fact behaviour to themselves ; and that his prosperity in this world's gear commanded their secret admiration far more than his genius as a dramatic writer. Not that even he has wholly escaped, for in his sonnets, which some assert are just his autobio graphy, are to be found abundance of food for the curious and judicial mind to convict him as a dealer in precious sentiments utterly at variance with his own life ; but, happily, the whole thing is so subtly mixed that it is next to valueless for the purposes of that simple order of minds which are so prevalent among candid relations. I am afraid this same familiarity has a deal to answer for. Is it not, indeed, chiefly its blame that it has passed into a proverb, that it is only after genius has become mortal that its worth is"], [195, "A Literary Relation. 175 recognised \u2014 that, in a sort of sacred sense, as I have heard it put, it has to die before it can save its fellow men ? And yet, perhaps, it is not the unkindest fate that could befall it \u2014 for poets, like historical events, cannot be judged of truly in their own day ; they are too near hand us ; the light which is beating on them is too fierce \u2014 dazzling and bewildering us by their very wealth of insignificant detail. It is only after the pale twilight has arisen between them and the tomb, obscuring the trivial, the mean, and the sordid, and revealing only what is holy and spiritual, that we can look at them with soft cool eyes and judge them justly. There may even be a shade more of charity than justice in our verdicts, but neither the poets nor, least of all, ourselves can be the losers on that score. And so, may it always be mine to view through the pleasant glamour of the past this picture of my literary relation hanging above my study mantel piece, by the magic of whose features I have been recalling other faces and figures out of the dear langsyne, I trust in the same spirit of kindly love and charity which I have been prescribing to my readers.

T N these days of high-pressure railroad civilisa- tion, I fear it will be considered worse than \"flat burglary\" \u2014 to borrow a Dogberryism \u2014 for me, a denizen of the city, whose time-honoured college sheltered within its walls the famous dis coverer of the magical power of steam, to lift up my voice in lamentation against the decay of that old-fashioned public service of carriers, which the introduction of steam power, with the ever increas ing multiplication and ramification of railways throughout the country, is fast pushing to the wall. That picturesque, and, I may say, social mode of carriage, the stage coach, is long since a thing of the past ; and the rising generation can only make its acquaintance now in novels, and the Sketch Book of Washington Irving, or along the Cumberland lake tourist routes. The carriers \u2014 those grey-whiskered, tough, sinewy figures, in fur caps, with upturned ear lappets, or \" Tam o' Shan-"], [200, "180 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. ter \" bonnets, and sleeved moleskin waistcoats, over the shoulders of which are strapped huge square leather pouches ; with heavily-laden carts, spanned, gipsy fashion, by weather-beaten awnings, and drawn by slow plodding horses, with unkempt fetlocks staffing at every step across their shining hoofs; and followed by great sauntering policeman like dogs, generally chained to the axletrees \u2014 the carriers, who issued thrice a week from the village to the nearest market town, may, partly on account of the nature of their goods and partly from other circumstances, be said to be dying much harder than the stage coach ; but dying, if not almost dead, they assuredly are, so that our grandchildren will know as much about them as we do about the antiquities of Greece or Rome. I never listen to a panegyric on the blessings of steam, and railways, and postal telegraphs, and all the rest of it, which have so greased the wheels of civilisation that everything is going at breakneck speed, without being old-fashioned enough to utter a demurrer, not loud, perhaps \u2014 I would be thought a lunatic if I did \u2014 but deep rather, like the curses of Macbeth's \" mouth friends.\" Brought to the test, however, my reason is willing to own that these modern discoveries and"], [201, "The Old and the Nezv Carrier. 181 inventions, like Fortunatus' wishing-hat, have as good as annihilated time and space. But if they have brought distant places near, and multiplied my opportunities for travelling and sight-seeing, they have at the same time increased my responsi bilities, and worry, and cares, which I cannot esteem an unmixed blessing in this already too chased mundane existence of ours. Besides, if the railway does take you quicker over the ground, the memory it leaves behind resembles a nightmare, a delirium, a feverish dream, the passage of a weaver's shuttle, \" a tale told by an idiot.\" But a journey performed in the slow carrier's cart, with its pleasant country sights, its stoppages by the way, its exchange of gossip and sly bantering talk at wayside inns, and farms, and cottages, is an experience that, to its minutest detail, imprints itself deeply on the youthful mind, and, like newly bottled wine, always improves with age ; for Though absent long, These forms of beauty have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man's eye : But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them, In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart ; And passing even into my purer mind, With tranquil restoration."], [202, "182 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. I am sure, for instance, that if David Copperfield had travelled from Blunderstone to Yarmouth in the train instead of Barkis the carrier's cart, these journeys would never have found a place in some of the most romantic chapters of his biography. But after all the concessions that reason and com mon-sense can make in favour of speedy travelling, was it for nothing else than that it has abolished the slow carrier's cart, and I shall never, in the pathetic words of the little song, behold it any more, I am sensible of a distinct grudge in my heart against the whole pack of railroads, which have been nicknamed by Ruskin \u2014 not without some shadow of reason \u2014 in one of those charming gusts of passion for which he is so famous, \" the loathsomest form of devilry now extant ; animated and deliberate earthquakes, destructive of all wise social habit or possible natural beauty ; carriages of damned souls on the ridges of their own graves.\" It is always with a feeling of real pain that I witness a village \u2014 one of those sequestered sleepy hollows I had known in the old days, with its homely carrier's cart and bustling stable yard, the lounge of village gossips and idlers \u2014 invaded by a railway service. And what adds to its acuteness is that I am all alone in my suffering, every second"], [203, "The Old and the New Carrier. 183 villager I meet declaring with satisfaction, and even enthusiasm, that the change has done the place a \"heap o' guid,\" and is, in fact, a great improvement. Tastes differ, and I suppose I must allow other people the same liberty of judgment I reserve to myself; but I think an ugly, chocolate-coloured, dog-box-looking erection, called a station, set down by the edge of a line of railway in the heart, or even on the skirts of a village, is the reverse of an improvement. And when you think of the trance like stillness of the straggling village street, with the opiate sunshine asleep on the footpath, broken every now and then by the demoniac screeches and yells of passing trains, John Ruskin's nick name of \" the loathsomest form of devilry now extant \" is not so far astray. If the nuisance stopped there, on the skirts of the village, it might be borne, or shut out from view ; but then it is contagious, and infects worse than a fever, a characteristic eruption breaking out in divers places, \" destructive,\" at least, \" of all possible natural beauty,\" if not, perhaps, of \" wise social habit ;\" and of which that modern three storey tenement, with flashy city-looking shops underneath, set down amongst thatched cottages"], [204, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 184 with long sloping gardens behind, is a painful illustration ; also the transformation of the quiet, unassuming \"Cross Keys Inn,\" as the enlarged signboard, in monster gold letters, tells us, into the \" Railway Arms Hotel,\" with complete new front window, all in one pane, radiant with vulgar paint, and decked out with show-cards and coloured bottles like the window of a common town pot house. At sight of these changes, wrought by the mir aculous genius of the new carrier, I am given to question if, as a race of human beings, we are one whit happier, or as happy, perhaps, as our grand sires, for all our hurry-scurry railroad civilisation, with its increased facilities for human traffic and travel, and our ability to cram so much into the life of our working-day ? Cram as you like ; heap it on, pressed down and running over, as you may, man can only stand what he can stand. Healthy mental existence is no more possible without a taste of leisure than healthy respiration without as much nitrogen in the air as will keep the oxygen from burning up our material frames too fast. If we don't get it in a brief holiday to the coast or country, where life generally burns down to the socket, and without the heart being as dry as"], [205, "The Old and the New Carrier. 185 summer dust either, we may find it in the perusal of a George Eliot's novel, with its portraiture of slow last century life ; but get it in some shape or another we must, or retire from the scene all the earlier to a premature grave to secure that rest under the green turf we should have had above it. In the good old times, before the discovery of steam power and the invention of the new carrier, holidays were unknown, for life was a perpetual holiday. It was not a hunger the one day and a burst the next. We didn't bolt life then as we do now, but took it leisurely, and had time to digest and enjoy it ; and it went to nourish us, and we wore a sleek, contented look, and lived to a green old age. These were the halcyon days of the elder carrier. He was quite a public character in his way, and as closely in touch with the life of the village or little town as either the doctor or the clergyman. If the former saw us safe into the world, and the latter conducted us as safely out of it, the carrier cheerfully bore our material burdens for us while in it. Almost the entire business of the little community which he served rested on his single shoulders, of which the capacious pocket-book he kept in the inside pocket of his sleeved moleskin N"], [206, "186 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. waistcoat, swollen out almost to bursting with letters and accounts and bank-notes, and bills and memoranda of all kinds, was abundant testimony. He brought the goods from the market town to the shopkeepers ; performed messages for the village housewives ; carried servant girls' boxes when they left their places ; executed commissions for the farmers in the ironmongery or grain and seed line ; and took an occasional passenger a cast in his cart, generally children or the female sex. There was a fine human neighbourliness about him. No garrulous housewife was afraid to speak to him or bore him with long-winded directions and questions. Giving him a parcel or a message was like entrusting it with a friend. His horse, too, sleek, slow, and plodding, was as familiar a favourite as himself ; little curly-headed, bare legged urchins, full of bravado, slipping up to it as it stood ready to depart, and touching its smooth coat with their tiny hands, the dog chained to the axle-tree beneath the cart not resenting the fami liarity ; while its measured step, as it came up the street at dusk and rumbled into the inn-yard, where the stable-boy was in waiting with the square lamp with the conical top, was as well"], [207, "The Old and the New Carrier. 187 known as the footstep of a husband on the door step. What a contrast all this to the new carrier. Nobody thinks of clapping his iron steed as it stands pawing at the station, getting up steam. Nor do they dare to use any more familiarity with the carriers themselves. Nobody dreams of taking these railway officials into their confidence, or if they do, they'll soon get a rude awakening. You must speak by the book to these taciturn gentry if you don't want the nose snapped off your face. To put a question to them, in such a neat and compressed manner as to secure a civil answer, is enough to give palpitation to the heart of the stoutest. And what a cold unsocial place is a railway station compared with the carrier's quarters? The very name of the latter smacks of snugness, with the warm yellow straw scattered about the ground, on the top of which the dog is stretched in a corner, watching through his half-shut eyes the miscellaneous heap of parcels lying around, and the unloaded cart with its shafts resting on a tressel, while his master is going about his business. How poor, too, does the new carrier compare"], [208, "188 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. with the old ? In the new everything is square, and shut in, and in line. In the old the reverse is the case. On busy days the hind door of the cart is let down on the ends of the shafts to accommo date a chest or bag of meal ; and empty paraffin oil cans, and baskets of dairy and garden produce, and braces of spring chickens, which he picks up at gate-posts by the way, or receives from the hands of sunburnt servant lassies at farm-road ends, dangle from the four corners of the cart. And, to complete the picture, an aged woman in black-and-white checked plaid looks out from the shadow of the awning, like the face of a Vandyke portrait from a canvas frame. The new carrier always presents a demoniac and forbidding appearance, whether we see it tear ing along the hillside, or emerging, as it were, from the inane into the railway station, breathing fire and thunder. Its predecessor again, under all circumstances, wears a familiar, homely aspect, which invites confidence and bespeaks a sweet human security. I remember after I had left home and taken up my residence in the big city, I still kept up a very substantial correspondence, once a fortnight, with the old woman, through the medium of this same"], [209, "The Old and the New Carrier. 189 old-fashioned carrier and a little square wooden box. The railway, to be sure, was in existence then, but we all preferred to patronise the not yet extinct carrier, perhaps because it was homelier, or it may have been on account of some conserva tive taint not yet eliminated from our radical veins, or more likely from some vague idea of its being safer ; for the little box was borne along the rough turnpike road, between hawthorn hedges, past lonely farmhouses, through scattered hamlets, and over the brown moor, every foot and object of which road my parents had travelled and were familiar with. The going to the \" carrier's quarters \" for that tiny box was the biggest event in my fortnight's city life. I believe the carrier in handing it to me shared some of the joy I felt in receiving it ; for he knew he was the blessed mediator between my mother and me, and I keep a kindly corner in my heart to this day for him. With what secret triumph I bore it home on my shoulder to my lodgings ! How eagerly I undid the rope, and was in among its contents ! And what contents ! There were my clean-washed clothes, not like those done in the city, which the old woman declared had \" aye a reekit smell,\" but with the odour of"], [210, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 190 the hedges on which they were dried saluting my nostrils the moment I opened the lid, and bringing before my mind's eye a picture of the garden and the green where I used to feed my rabbits on the tufts of white clover, and the knock-kneed zigzag rickety-elbowed pear-tree in the middle, whose slow ripening fruit used to set our young mouths a-watering every time we looked up at it. But what little bit of paper is this pinned to the breast of one of my shirts ? A brief inventory of some of the contents, with a spice of home gossip and sage counsel thrown into the bargain. In the toe of each of my clean-washed, well-darned stockings is nestling a fresh new-laid egg. And here, packed between my shirts and flannels, is a \" farle\" or two of scone and oatcake, the latter, the little note tells me, to be sure and get my landlady to back-toast before I eat it, otherwise it will not taste nice and crumpy. Down in a corner, wrapped in a cabbage-blade out of the garden, is the end of a roll of powdered butter, its creamy sides distilling diamond beads of dew. Further down yet, oh my eyes ! a great thick slice of haggis, mother's own make, which the little slip of paper, I find, tells me they had to breakfast on my birthday, and thought tasted very good. And, to crown all, tied"], [211, "The Old and the New Carrier. 191 in a corner of my coloured cotton handkerchief is a shining half-crown, just like it used to be tied when I was a little chick sent on an errand, and stuffed down my bosom at the tickly place of the neck, lest I should lose it or get it stolen from me. I don't remember now, but I trust that my heart, overcome by this flavour of maternal love and home associations, was full to bursting sometimes as I lifted the contents, one after another, out of their hiding places. I would like to think that my eyes on some of those occasions swam in my head, and that I only saw indistinctly, as through thick crystal, the things before me, though I was quite sensible all the time of the big round tears cours ing hot down the sides of my innocent nose, and dropping among the things in the box. There are some weaknesses that we are secretly proud of, and which we increasingly cherish with our growth of years and sense ; and tenderness for the memories of. our loving mothers, I think, is one of them. The pity is that the dear hands which packed those thoughtless sons' boxes are usually mouldering in the cold ground before we realise our loss, and with it the opportunity of ever repaying that love again. I often think of a saying of the old woman's"], [212, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 192 which she was in the habit of giving utterance to when she fancied her offspring were indifferent to her maternal sacrifices, \" Mothers are like poets, it is only after they are dead and buried that their works are prized and their praises sung ; \" though I can aver that this knowledge never made her spare herself in the least, any more than it makes the budding bard chary of his midnight oil. And on the heels of that saying she would generally observe further \u2014 with a pathos that I was too young then to feel the force of \u2014 \" I wish I had my mother back, I wadna vex her as I hae done.\" Many a lonely heart in the bitterness of regret, both before and since her time, has given utterance to that same wish, but that is one of the prayers, no matter how fervently offered up, to which there comes no answer \u2014 Neither present time nor years unborn Can to our sight that heavenly face restore. The good Dr. Johnson, who had a quick con science, must frequently have uttered it in some of the melancholy moods to which he was subject. And because he could not get back his father, whom he had once vexed by refusing to go and keep the bookstall for him in Uttoxeter market place, he afterwards went in his old age and stood"], [213, "The Old and the New Carrier. 193 for a stricken hour, with uncovered grey hairs, in the very spot where his father's stall used to stand, a spectacle to every gaping passer-by, as an act of penance for his former disobedience. It may be matter of conjecture the amount of satisfaction which the shade of the old Lichfield bookseller would derive from this heroic act of penance of his son, but there can be no question, I think, about the peace that would come to the big bursting heart of the great lexicographer, as the uncouth figure of him stood there in broad day, with uncovered head, in the market place ; truly a figure not to be despised by the curious and mar velling multitude, if it rightly understood the sight, but to be envied rather. If the virtue that went out of him on that memorable occasion, leaving him weak but com forted, was not what is termed a direct answer to his prayer, it was surely the next best thing to it ; for if the father could not come to the son, the son had gone to the father, and, even in a more literal sense than when he was in the flesh, been closer to him in that hour of expiation than at any similar period in his former lifetime. Contemplating human frailty in the light of the above incident, I have my misgivings whether those who manage to"], [214, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 194 regulate their lives so as to escape such acts of penance do not also escape something else which they would be richer for having. The knowing ones osthis world, in whom wisdom may not be said to linger, but comes early ; those self-contained persons who talk smugly about the propriety of squaring their conduct so that what ever happens \u2014 by which is usually meant the death of a sickly parent or relation with whom they are at \" loggerheads\" \u2014 they will escape reflection after wards, I have never known whether most to pity or to envy. I fear, however, my sympathy is on the side of those less fortunately constituted, and who, I guess, are the big majority among us \u2014 the simple and impulsive, who must have their wind out, cost what it may, and who are only wise after the event, \" ahint the han',\" as the shrewd Scotch have it. Experience is the only teacher of these simple ones. They must go through their full apprentice ship and become fathers and mothers themselves, and see their own thoughtless past mirrored in the careless present of their children ere they have their lesson properly off. True, their knowledge comes too late to save reflection. They must pay the penalty. But if the cup is bitter to drink it"], [215, "The Old and tlie New Carrier. 195 has still some dregs of comfort lying at the bottom, in the thought that it is better to have learned too late than never to have learned at all. For with this knowledge comes a new insight into the beauty and the holiness of motherhood, which works the same miracle on their affections as the purifying furnace, seven times tried, does on gold. They become heirs of a second and elder childhood in their old days, and sing, in accordance with the old woman's dictum, the praises of their dead mothers, as they do their most deeply-lamented poets, with a far wider understanding, and a quicker sympathy, \" than when they lived indeed.\" They unclasp the \" book and volume of their brain,\" and ransack its pages in search of the most delicate morsels of langsyne, little tit bits of reminiscence, to feed their fancy upon. They steal back in spirit to the old home, and drawing their chair up to the generous hearth, become actors again in the simple drama of the household life, playing their little parts, whether of comedy or tragedy \u2014 in which their loving mothers always take the chief part \u2014 with an inward sense of realism that your histrionic genius wots not of. They tell their children tales of the flowery days of boyhood, in which the same dead mothers \u2014"], [216, "196 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. those comfortable Madonnas in clean print frocks or drugget petticoats and coloured shortgowns we knew fifty years ago \u2014 are the sainted heroines. They lie awake in the night, and watching the white moonlight from the window aslant the wall of their chamber, they think of the same moonlight lying on their mother's grave, and silvering the white sandstone at her head ; and if, like Tennyson to his Arthur, they feel nearer to her, there will sometimes come over them such an eerie kind of pity, as they muse on what was once the warm breathing flesh-and blood form of her who had fondled and caressed them, now imprisoned in the cold dark ground ; and they will not be able to get to sleep till they have arisen and perhaps smoked a pipe of the Lethean weed. They treasure old keep sakes ; show a weakness for old books which were their mother's favourites, or in which her name has been inscribed with her own hand. Heirlooms in the shape of an old mahogany eight-day clock, with a crack across its olive-tinted face, or an old chest of drawers, in which the veneer is sadly chipped around the keyholes, are held in higher esteem than the most modern new ones which money could purchase ; and all because they had"], [217, "The Old and the New Carrier. 197 once stood in the old home, and dead eyes had looked up at the dingy dial-plate, and dead hands fumbled in their worm-eaten drawers. Old pic tures, too, of familiar spots which a mother's presence has hallowed, wretched daubs though they be, are more precious in their sight than the oldest of old masters. And shadowy mildewed photographs, of features mouldering to dust beneath their shrouds, are hung on the line and in the places of honour on the walls of their most private chamber, where they can look on them without needing to conceal their emotions. In a word, to adapt the language of the good Friar Francis, and fit it to this theme of dead mother hood, \u2014 The idea of her life doth sweetly creep Into their study of imagination ; And every lovely organ of her life Doth come apparell'd in more precious habit, More moving delicate, and full of life, Than when she liv'd indeed.\" But whither is my pen carrying me ?

It seems an age since I left the carrier's quarters in the big city, bearing proudly aloft on my shoulder what has turned out to be a kind of Pandora's"], [218, "198 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. casket, or \" Fancy's Show Box \" rather, instead of a little square brown-painted homely wooden trunk, tied with a bit of common rope, and stuffed with such prosaic materials as stockings and shirts and vulgar bread and butter. These pictures from the fields of memory exhausted, I now feel pretty much like a showman who has got to the end of his tether. Still, to lay down my pen without a farewell word about the old carrier, in whose behalf I so valiantly took it up, would, I fear, not only be shabby, but a mistake, from the artist's point of view, into the bargain. To complete my sketch, therefore, suppose I make you a present of a ride, the first and only one I ever had in a carrier's cart, which this babble about dead mothers brings back to my mind, where, like a vigorous etching on a white mount, it has remained printed since boyhood, when all the railway jour neys I have performed in the interval, and they have not been few, are a blurred mass of confusion, or blotted out entirely."], [219, "A RIDE IN A CARRIER'S CART."], [220, "\" Going by railroad I do not consider as travelling at all ; it is merely 'being sent' to a place, and very little different from be - coming a parcel.\" \u2014 Ruskin."], [221, "XI. A RIDE IN A CARRIER'S CART. A T the close of my last paper I promised, by way of a finish to my sketch of \" The Old and the New Carrier,\" to treat the reader to a ride in a carrier's cart ; but I must first relate how it happened that I came to be a passenger in that primitive conveyance. I had had a severe illness just as I was entering on my teens. A promising young physician, to whom I related my symptoms years afterwards, told me I must have been suffering from purpura rheumatica. That may have been so, but I know that my case was a great puzzle, not only to my distressed parents, but our kind old family doctor as well, who certainly never called it by that long learned name, if, indeed, he ventured to christen it by any appellation. All I remember is, that the joints of my lower limbs always became swollen, and stiff, and painful, simultaneous with an out strike in the skin of bright scarlet spots, extending o"], [222, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 202 from the knees to below the ankles, whenever I for sook the warm bed for a few hours ; that the swelling and stiffness, and pain, vanished again after I had been back a short time among the blankets, as did also the spots, more gradually, however, for they first became purple, then a yellowish green, which, turning fainter and fainter in colour, finally faded into the general hue of the skin, like patches of ecchymosis, I think the doctors call it, in an ordin ary contusion ; that I swallowed a whole shopful of medicine in the form of red gritty powders that stuck in the teeth, and nauseous mixtures that no such antidote as a spoonful of black currant jam or piece of lump sugar could ever take the bitter out of ; that I was frightened almost to death by my Sabbath school teacher coming and praying in rather ominous language for me ; that the dark shadow was lifted the next day by the minister himself calling, and not praying for me, but telling me he would send Sindbad the Sailor and other tales for me to read, which he did ; and that I gradually got better, after two or three months' illness, when the buds were plainly visible on the rowan tree at the kitchen window, and the clam orous pigeons, belonging to the dovecot on the opposite wall, were alighting on the darting-boards"], [223, "A Ride in a Carrier's Cart. 203 every sew minutes with straws in their beaks, and triumphantly bearing them into the interiors to build their nests. It was arranged that, as soon as I was strong enough to travel, I was to go for a change on a visit to my aunt, who resided in a romantic little village situated on the classic banks of the Ayr. Accordingly one afternoon in the lachrymose month of April my mother and I (for my father considered it prudent that in my weak state of health she should see me safely at my destination, adding that she \"wad be nane the waur o' the change hersel' for a day after a' her trouble an' anxiety \"), rigged out in our best, and holding a somewhat plethoric paper bundle between us, found ourselves passengers in Johnny Blane's carrier's cart. This mode of travelling was chosen, I believe, because the cart would be able to take us all the way, almost to my aunt's door ; whereas the train would have left us two or three miles off. It was one of those long-bodied carts, with little square open panels along the sides and ends through which the contents peeped, and gipsy-like green awning stretched half-circlewise over the top, open in front, but made to close behind with two curtain-like flaps, which tied with strings, so"], [224, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 204 as to keep out draughts. We were perched well towards the front on the top of the miscellaneous heap of luggage, our heads nearly touching the awning, and our feet and legs squeezed down in the wider spaces between the parcels. The carrier himself, a neat, compact little man, in calfskin cap with ear flaps, and hodden-grey sleeved waistcoat, over the shoulder of which was strapped a large square black leather pouch, walked by the horse's side till we were well out of town and on to the turnpike road ; then he jumped up, and seating himself on the fore-end of the cart, with his feet resting on the shaft, took from his waistcoat pocket a short clay tobacco pipe, which he lighted with the aid of a flint, and began to smoke with evident enjoyment. The little bit of gipsy in my boy's blood used always to circulate in my veins with a kind of envy when I beheld, at fair times, one of those itinerant showmen, seated behind a lean Rosinante, driving down our main street on the road to the show-ground, his beautiful house, with real glass windows, and white lace curtains, and smoking chimney, and fat wife in huge gold earrings, leaning with folded arms over the lower half of the door, complacently surveying, I used to think,"], [225, "A Ride in a Carrier's Cart. 205 the gaping and untravelled rustics with a mixture of pity and contempt in her sleek black eye. And here, at last, was I a passenger in something as like a showman's caravan as could be ; and as I sat cribbed, cabined, and confined among unyielding packages \u2014 which inconvenience I never felt, how ever \u2014 looking out the front of the awning on the afternoon spring sunshine glinting warm on the bare landscape, my only fear was that my journey's end might be reached too soon. Spring, I always think, is about the nicest time in the whole year to recover from a lengthened illness. You have left the dreary winter behind you, as you have the dismal sick chamber ; and, keeping out of sight such disconcerting reminder of what you have passed through, as the rattling hail in the sunny shower, or the thin ragged sheet of snow on the infant shoulders of spring \u2014 grim winter's bag-shakings\u2014- you see a long spell of fine weather before you in the approaching summer and autumn, just as you do of restored health in the days to come, unless when a black cloud suddenly darkens the blue of your sky in a momentary twinge of your old pain. There is a closer similarity between the convalescent and this wayward season even yet. Disease has been"], [226, "206 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. withering and wasting his body as winter the leaves and the flowers. Returning health brings fresh life and hope to the pale face and spent frame, as returning spring does to the woods and the fields. The torpid blood in the veins of the convalescent flows quicker, and with a livelier sense of enjoyment ; so does the sap in the branches and trunks of trees, and in the delicate rootlets of the herbs and the grasses. I did not think, to be sure, of all this as I sat in the carrier's cart looking out from under the green awning, watching the great heaped-up banks of white fleecy clouds sailing along the horizon on a field of tender blue ; and the fitful gleams of sunshine making blithe the red earth of the newly harrowed fields, and sending a flush of livelier green dancing across the young braird of wheat, and over the bare woods and hedges, where a remnant of last year's beech leaves, all crumpled and red, still rustled in the fresh west wind. I did not think about all this, but simply drank in, with my quickened circulation, the new intoxication of earth and sky ; and if my young head felt something of that strange lightness which comes, they say, from quaffing champagne, it never occurred to me to consider the reason why, which"], [227, "A Ride in a Carrier's Cart. 207 quality of youthful unconsciousness is, after all, the very height of enjoyment, as the perfection of juvenile digestion, or indeed any digestion what soever, may be said to be in its unconsciousness of such a thing as a gastric organ. While we are tracing a sympathy between the condition of the convalescent and the fitful moody laughing and crying spring, the spoiled child of the year, I am reminded that there are some striking points of likeness between that season of new life and hope and her more sedate and pensive sister, autumn. There is a distinctive character about the colour of the bare spring hedges and \" plantins,\" when seen in mass, which resembles that of advanced autumn : the same subtle wist ful Corot-like silvery greys and nameless greens, and dreamy invisible purples and browns. Even among the newly sprouted foliage there are the same yellow, and olive, and red, and brown tints on the infant leaves, only they are far lighter and tenderer in colour, just as our first childhood is seen shining through the furrows and wrinkles of the second ; soon, however, the full-leaved summer drowns out this similarity in a world of luxuriant green, just as our bearded manhood forms a wide and impassable gulf between bairntime and age."], [228, "208 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. I need hardly say that I did not make this com- parison to myself, as our slow carrier's cart rumbled us along the brown turnpike road. I only revelled in the new-born gladness all around me, myself new-born from a kind of half death into joyous life, its sense of sweetness made all the rarer by contrast. And when the sun came out from behind a big cloud and filled my heart with a glow corresponding to that on the landscape, and then slipped out of sight again, and for a moment the world was dull, and a gust of bleak wind came sweeping through the awning of the cart from the seam behind, making my young thin blood feel as chilly as the sunshine a moment before had made it warm, I never moralised that this shine and shade were symptomatic of all man's pilgrim- ages, whether performed in carrier's carts or lord mayor's carriages ; and that in all my subsequent journeyings through life this was what I must expect to meet with. This moralising generally comes late \u2014 in the ripe, reflective autumn, or even the white-haired winter of life, rather than the spring or summer ; when the youthful fires in our bosoms have burned out, and, armed with our handful of white ashes of experience \u2014 our sole stock in trade \u2014 vve set up"], [229, "A Ride in a Carrier's Cart. 209 for philosophers, little dreaming that, if our fiery chastening has left us richer and wiser, it has also the knack of sometimes imparting to us a touch of morbid, unhealthy antiqueness, something of the flavour of an old cracked china jar, or decrepit piece of furniture with a history. Much more in my way than moralising were the sights along the road, the only fear haunting me, as I said before \u2014 for even in boyhood pleasure is not unalloyed \u2014 that I might be at my journey's end too soon. We were already several miles on the road ; had passed through the coal and iron district, with its tall furnaces, their red and yellow flames climbing the sky and licking the white clouds ; its piled up Vesuvius-like heaps of slag ; its unpicturesque rows of colliers' and iron-workers' houses, barren, and black, and grimy, sitting on a blasted heath \u2014 fit meeting-place for witches \u2014 in a thick atmos phere of smoke, amid broken hedges and fences as black and grimy almost as themselves. We had left the red glare of the furnaces, like so many pillars of fire, a long way behind, and were once more on the open road. The white naked walls of distant farm steadings gleamed whiter in the sunlight, above the roofs of which we could see"], [230, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 210 the blue smoke tossing hither and thither in the playful wind. And stretching on either side of us were the long undulating squares of brown fields, on some of which the green braird was already visible ; and from which came ever and anon to our ears the \"gee up, wo bane wo,\" of the hus bandmen to their horses, mingled with the after noon song of the lark and the mellow notes of the mavis and blackbird. At Cross Roads, a cluster of houses, with a schoolhouse, a smithy, and a joiner's shop, we stopped for a few minutes till the carrier unpacked from his cart some long narrow bars of iron for the smith, and fished out of the trunk at the back of the cart a parcel of white mountings for a coffin which the joiner had been commissioned to make for the schoolmaster, who died the day before. The body of a cart was sitting on low tressels at the joiner's shop door, and a raw, bony youth, with very red hair and red freckles on his face, was carelessly painting it a bright blue colour, and listening with all his might, and considerable scepticism, I thought, in his astonished visage, to the catalogue of virtues the carrier and his master and the brawny smith were ascribing to the dead dominie. A pair of new wheels stood against the"], [231, "A Ride in a Carrier s Cart. 211 wall of the smithy, behind an old rusty harrow, waiting for the tyres. On the joiner's shop door, plastered thick with red and blue and white paint, was a bill announcing that a roup of farm stock \u2014 the property of an intending emigrant \u2014 would take place on such and such a day. While my eye was taking in all these objects, I don't remember whether I thought most about the oddness of the pale visitant being here in this out of-the-way place; or about the intending emigrant, with whom my imagination sailed away over the sea ; or about whether I would choose for a trade the joiner's or the smith's \u2014 the coffin-making branch of the former I felt to be a decided draw back to it \u2014 but the \" gee up, Bell,\" of the carrier put my thoughts to flight, and away we rumbled on the road again. A mile or two beyond Cross Roads we passed over the Cessnock, one of those picturesque streams with which our beloved Ayrshire is everywhere intersected, and with which its lyric and ballad poetry is made for ever vocal. I felt quite giddy, as from my elevation I thrust my head past the frame of the awning, my mother holding me back by the sleeve of the jacket all the time, and looked down its steep shelvy sides, covered with lichen"], [232, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 212 stains and cool mossy nooks, from one of which latter a cluster of early primroses peeped forth like stars of gold set in a cushion of green, and saw the runnel of water in the bottom reflecting the after noon clouds floating on their field of tender blue. Then came the \" lang leuk,\" as it was called ; one of those continuous stretches of turnpike road in which, strain the eye as you like, there appears to be \"no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\" A \"plantin\" of almost corresponding length ran along one side of it, whose sombre shade, adding to the sense of infinitude, invested it with a double air of mystery. It is one of those curious and in explainable facts, like the incongruous things we meet with in dreams, how our boyish impressions of places haunt the imagination in after years, serving as the theatres of events and occurrences not yet come to birth, or of which we as yet are ignorant ; becoming the scenes, so to speak, where the mind's eye lays its dramas of to-day, or a thousand years ago, it is equally the same thing, \u2014 and with the same helpless disregard of likeli hood or fitness as the sleeper experiences in his dreams.

Or should I hap pen to open the volume at Cymbeline, and follow the fortunes of the runaway Imogen in quest of her sorely-abused husband, it is always into this Ayrshire forest that she strays on her way to Mil ford haven. It is among its tangled mazes that she so miraculously lights on the cave of Belarius ; and it is beneath its leafy shade that her grieved brothers, Guiderius and Arviragus, lay her for dead, after strewing her body with flowers and \" herbs that have on them the cold dew o' the night,\" as befits the dead, and singing her to the ground as they once did good Euriphile, their mother : \u2014 \" Fear no more the heat 0' the sun Nor the furious winter's rages ;"], [234, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 214 Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages ; Golden lads and girls all must, As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.\" \" It's a lang road that has nae turnin'.\" This wise saw \u2014 so frequently tendered for the comfort of those passing through an unusually prolonged crisis of suffering or trial \u2014 I have an impression was heard by me for the first time from the lips of the carrier as our cart came at length in sight of the bend in the road.

It was Saturday evening, and the week's labour being finished, knots of rustics in half-dress were gossiping about the cross ; while others \u2014 Satur day's grime still on their honest faces \u2014 were smok ing their pipes in the gardens behind their cottages and planting potatoes and \"green-kail,\" a fresh supply of the latter, in the shape of small parcels of young plants, tied with bands of straw, and full of delicate green, and yellow, and purple colour, having been brought from the market town in our cart, were handed over the hedges by the carrier to the amateur gardeners as we passed along. Tarrying at the door of Poosie Nansie's village public, where our willing Bell had a drink and a mouthful of corn, and her master busied himself in undoing from the cart a keg of ale for the con-"], [240, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 220 sumption of the patrons of that classic house, we had some leisure to look about us. The warm level sunshine, slanting against the gables and sides of the old-fashioned houses, and striking the angles of the red sandstone church and steeple, and hoar tombstones standing uneasily around its moss-stained walls, tempered the bleak air. Down in a garden hollow a bonfire \u2014 made of the cuttings of gooseberry and currant bushes, and the trimmings of hedges, and last year's \" kail stocks,\" and other vegetable refuse \u2014 blazed and crackled ; while a group of bare-legged, happy children, from whose veins there might not yet have been eliminated all the blood of their stone age forefathers, leapt and shouted around its climb ing tongues of flame, like so many young Otaheiti aboriginals. I feel in my old nostrils the odour of these burning sticks now as I write, and see the wind blown, fantastic coils of thick blue smoke ascend ing by the roofless walls of Muir's castle beside the churchyard, with the roseate sky for a back ground. The hubbub caused by the disloading of the keg of ale brought my eyes back to the public, where I beheld, through the kitchen window, the fire"], [241, "A Ride in a Carrier's Cart. 221 burning brightly in the wide roomy chimney-place, and its reflection dancing on the copper and tin \" clearin' things \" on the wall, and on the girdle suspended from the roof, which the \"jumping and thumping \" of a certain company of inebriates, the poet informs us, had even made emit music ; at least, if that was not \" the vera girdle \" which \" rang,\" it was in all likelihood its successor. My mother told me it was round this same fire that Burns's \" Jolly Beggars,\" \" A merry core, O' randie, gangrel bodies,\" met and \"held the splore,\" one October or Novem ber night. The \" bien,\" comfortable air of this old fashioned interior was perhaps the only thing that touched my sympathies at the time, but years afterwards, when I made the acquaintance of this strange, abandoned company of pedlars, and tink lers, and one-legged soldiers, and fiddlers, and travelling bards, and their amorous doxies, keeping up their wild orgie of drinking and song-singing, till \" They toom'd their pocks an' pawn'd their duds, To quench their lowan drouth,\" strange to say, it was with this same ruddy fire light, I was watching through the kitchen window,"], [242, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 222 shining on their \" auld red rags \" and \" mealy bags.\" She further informed me, pointing through the opening made in the awning at the back of the cart to let out the keg of ale, that \" it was roon the hoose-en' there, up the lane a wee bit, that Jean Armour's father leev'd, whaur, dootless, the poet had mony a nicht seen her hame.\" She was ob serving that I was \" young enough yet to un'erstan' Burns's an' Jean's story, but some day I wad read it for mysel', an' wad min', maybe, that she had let me see the hoose,\" when the carrier, having completed his business (which included sundry other calls on neighbouring shopkeepers), and been the recipient of at least one good stiff refreshment, took Bell, with a \" gee up,\" by the head, and off we rumbled again. By the time we were clear of the village the air felt much chillier. The sun's rays became feebler and duller as we skirted the side of the Balloch myle woods, and gave place at last to a cold keen twilight, on the bluish grey sky of which the ghost of a sickle-shaped moon, in the modest company of a timid shame-faced star, was already visible.

Indeed, when we arrived in the stable-yard, and the carrier helped me down, my limbs were so stiff with my long seat, and the manner in which they had been cramped among the luggage, that I could hardly walk ; and my apprehensive mother would not believe that it was not a relapse of my puzzling illness, till she saw them suppled under the magic influence of a cup of my aunt's warm tea, and the genial heat from her kitchen fire."], [244, ""], [245, "MY MOTHER'S PICTURE,"], [246, "' ' I would fain linger on and say more, much more ; but of what use would it be ?

'\"THE author of Rab and his Friends, in a \"Letter to John Cairns, D.D.,\" in his delightful Horae Subsecivae, relates how his father's friend, the Rev. John Belfrage, M.D., having lost his wife, and pos- sessing no portrait of her, shut himself up in his room for fourteen days, and then came out wasted and feeble, bringing with him a beautiful miniature painting and genuine likeness of her on ivory, which he had executed with his own hand, though utterly ignorant of drawing. As such an extra- ordinary feat of will \u2014 surely the most extraordi- nary ever known \" in the history of human sorrow and resolve \" \u2014 was altogether beyond my poor skill, I did the next best, which was to make a water colour drawing of the house in which my mother died ; and poor, washed-out, poverty-stricken colour it is, as may easily be seen, but it was the best my uninformed hand could do. The subject \u2014 a somewhat genteel-looking modern two-storey ashlar-painted house set back a few yards from"], [248, "228 Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. the turnpike road at the northern extremity of the town, with trimly kept garden plot in front reach ing forward to the footpath, and enclosed with a stone parapet and iron railing, lilac coloured like the house, the property of a substantial, well-to-do country blacksmith, who occupied the lower half of it himself, and let the upper half, of which my mother was the old and respected tenant \u2014 I say a subject of this kind was hardly suited to the genius of an amateur artist, whose sins, whatever they may be, are certainly never those of breadth. A cunninger hand would have toned down all these sharp edges, and angles, and cold hard lines ; it would not have grieved it very deeply if it had not been able to get in every stone ; and, somehow, the windows would have been painted with a broader blurrier brush, and not shown with nice new white astracles. The ploughs and harrows ex posed to view on the vacant piece of ground to the right ofthe garden plot, and behind which, screened by a paling and some trees, stood the smithy, was just the very temptation which a young, unwary artist was sure to fall into. I guess I put my foot in the trap, not only by too carefully tracing out the anatomy of these agricultural implements, but by laying on the bright red and blue colour, all"], [249, "My Mother's Picture. 229 the more lavishly, perhaps, because there was such poor scope for colour about the house itself. The only really picturesque thing about the subject is the row of decrepit thatched cottages running out of the picture in a line with the foot path, their gable, ivy-clad to the chimney head, forming the left boundary line ofthe smith's garden plot. Even here I did not distinguish myself. The lovely brown thatch, with its green velvety patches of moss and tufts of luxuriant weeds and grasses, would not come right, and looks like dirty ginger bread. Neither would the ivy stand out from the gable, with the light shimmering on its dark glossy leaves, and the shadow, as of night, in the recesses behind. The more I wrought at it the worse it got, till it wore the aspect of a terrier's coat dyed a bluish-green colour. Nor was I a bit more suc cessful with the white cottage walls, the light and shade and weather staining getting mixed up into a general dead clayey colour; or with the ash tree, its leafy arms thrusting themselves from the garden behind the house into the angle between the ivy clad gable and our kitchen window. I suppose I was too particular, trying to stick on every leaf. I succeeded better with the monkey's puzzle and the clipped holly in the garden plot. They are rather"], [250, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 230 solid and pronounced in colour, like the ploughs and the harrows, but they will pass. The sky, at once the terror and despair of all young painters, was no exception in my case. Perhaps the extreme nervousness I felt in handling a phenomenon of so aerial and spiritual a quality had something to do with the lamentable result. The clouds, which I was compelled to stick on with thick body colour, I was going to say, are \" neither shape nor form ; \" but, on second thoughts, that is just their vice, they have too much shape and form ; and, of course, are sadly lacking in the feeling of softness, transparency, or motion. The foreground also, I fear, would be condemned as too sodden and dead, but the satisfactory breaking up of a foreground is another of those nice points which test the skill and experience of the artist. But each and all of its defects, as a work of art, cannot rob me of the deep enjoyment which a con templation of its details produces in my breast. If I can never look on that mother's dear face again, it is surely some compensation that I can at least see the window from which she beheld all the objects I have been pointing out in the picture.

They were the first objects which filled her vision when she got up in the morning and raised the window blind, as they were the last when she drew it down again at the darkening and lit the lamp. She was acquainted with them in every variety of light and shade, and time and season. She had seen them in the cold grey of the morn ing ; the throbbing noonday ; the gloaming, when the window panes of her neighbour's houses oppo site were all a-flame with crimson and gold ; in the twilight, which, like charity, covereth a multitude of sins ; in the witching moonlight ; in rain and storm, and in frost and snow.

The distant wood was bare, the fields brown, and the bleak wind was shaking the window casement, and swaying the slim monkey's puzzle to and fro, and lifting the blue smoke from the ivy-clad chimney top, and tossing it on to the brown thatch, and among the rustling ivy. As I watch her turn away from the window \u2014 oh so tired and ill ! \u2014 to the bed from which she was never more to rise, that last scene comes rushing back with painful vividness to my mind. I can hear the window casement rattle in the eerie wind as it did all that long night she lay a-dying, and the fitful battering of heavy raindrops against the panes with every other strong blashy gust. Her thin pinched features, with the hectic flush on the tops of her cheeks, and the far-away vacant look in the eyes, stare up at me from the pillow. I hear her short, hurried, laboured breathing, but can make no sense of her low, rambling talk, which is running on events and things that the old man, dazed and dumb with grief, says happened before I was born.

Oh that window ! to this ashlar-painted house, almost what sight is to the human face.

In conversing with the old folks, one of its chief glories, and more than half its comfort, is that I don't require to keep my thumb on anything whatever. It is not the least necessary to repress my young en thusiasms, or subject to discipline my innocent vanities, and nice bombasts, and ridiculous flights of ambition. I can expose my heart in all its simple nakedness and greenness, and even natural wickedness, as confidently as I would do before the throne of grace, assured that no mean advan tage will be taken of it \u2014 that I will not be nipped up at my word and placed in a false light. I can say almost anything, no matter how \"daft\" or out rageous, knowing that the proper percentage will be generously deducted from it \u2014 that it will be charitably set in its true perspective.

I spout before them the rankest heresy which I have got inoculated with at the university and in my intercourse with books and the world. These shocks to their orthodoxy, whether relating to re ligion or the general conduct of life, never, for a moment, make them think of excommunicating me. They shake their heads with a comical mix ture of gravity and perplexity. New and original doctrines about the philosophy of life and religion have no novelty for them. They have passed the age for that. They prefer to stick to the old fashioned views of things. Conservatism is their sheet anchor. But they are not seriously alarmed at the mental condition of their radical son. I don't believe they see any great inharmony between my heresy and their orthodoxy. They have a notion that it is a kind of idiosyncracy of a young man's blood, which will get toned down by and by. If it is a sin, it is certainly not one that will bring the blush to the family cheek, as the grosser ones of dishonesty or drunkenness would.

But I don't make much progress with my studies, for the old woman \u2014 more jealous than a lover who knows that another day will carry her sweetheart far from her sight and the sound of her voice \u2014 resolves to make the most of the present moment, and so keeps talking, and questioning, and narrating bits of home-news and gossip, flavoured with scraps of equally homely philosophy. I don't feel the least annoyed. On the contrary, I rather like it. Besides, it is holiday time. Next week, and for many weeks to come, I will have ample opportunity for study in my soli tary lodgings, with my cat-footed landlady slipping out and in to spread my frugal meal, or put just as much coal on my fire as will keep it from dying of sheer starvation, and I will not be able to see her face or hear her talk, however ardently I may long for the same. With my book in my hand then, if not for serious study, at least as a slight concession to my student conscience, and the tones of the old woman's voice in my ear, I sit and dream out my forenoon hour on the window-shelf, where I see lying in my mother's work-basket, among cloth clippings of every complexion, her scissors, and thread, and ball of yarn, and scarlet pin cushion."], [259, "My Mother's Picture. 239 In this idle mood, with my back leaning against the window shutter, and my head clear above the snow-white screen, I can, at the same time, see all that is going on outside. The winter sunshine \u2014 which I always think has something in it of that rich golden colour which we see in the pictures of such old masters as Titian \u2014 is lying on the stubble field; melting the \"cranreuch\" on the thatched roofs of the houses opposite, and on the brown, hard road, along which a heaped cart of turnips has just passed. The clipped holly, the monkey's puzzle, and the ivy-clad gable in the smith's garden plot are all in a glittering perspiration with the warmth of its beams. And on a sprig of the ivy, close to the chimney-head of the gable, out of which rises the most ethereal blue smoke, sits a robin redbreast eyeing the old woman and me through the window panes, his bright beads of eyes beseeching, even more plainly than the liquid pleadings of his tongue, to be admitted as one of the company. \" Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours,\" when I used to sit smoking and chatting with the old folks by our evening fire, or idly dreaming away the forenoon perched on the window-shelf,"], [260, "Ayrshire Idylls of Other Days. 240 the pleasant murmur of my mother's talk in my ears, and the splendour of the winter sunshine basking on the familiar objects outside in my eyes \u2014 \" Could those few pleasant days again appear, Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here ?

If it were otherwise, I fear, life would lose much of its earnestness and solemnity ; and even death would be robbed of half its mystery. Our beloved dead, who are not in our eyes, \" an hour more or less,\" older or younger than when they left us, have had their day, and \"to constrain Their unbound spirits into bonds again.\" would be a mistaken kindness at the best.

The interval is theirs to reap their harvest of immortality, which, in greater or smaller degree, is the lot of the most humble as well as of those who write epics and slay their country's enemies ; and ours to pay up the arrears of love and duty which we had not even the sense to know we owed when they were with us.

PRESS NOTICES. \" For the casual reader who chooses his book by its title, there is nothing about this volume to fascinate, and even when we have scanned its opening pages we scarcely realise its purpose, though the elegance and picturesqueness of the language can scarcely fail to impress us. It is when we have been introduced to the author in the seclusion of his garden in the midst of busy, bustling Glasgow\u2014 a kind of oasis in the desert\u2014 and enter into the spirit of his musings that we begin to realise that there is something really valuable in his work that appeals strongly to our sentiments and intelligence. It is not all a dissertation on the beaulies of his garden or on the changes of the seasons \u2014 though these subjects in themselves are treated in a manner calculated to awaken many fruitful fancies. We do not require to go far into the volume ere the author strikes a chord of sympathy between himself and the reader. For him the garden has tender associations apart from the flowers which we see him tending with so consummate care \u2014 the memory of a beloved child who now sleeps in the Necropolis over the wall, and whose image is imprinted on many of these pages, full as they are of the sweetness which characterises a writer who seems to feel every word he writes. Every chapter"], [264, "2 teems with fresh and fragrant thoughts on many of the common places of life, and even the poor cornet player on the street supplier a text for as touching a little sermon as ever was preached from pnliiit. If there is one chapter in the book which speaks more eloquently than another, it is ' The Kitchen Meeting,' with its homely but stirring and practical preacher; its sad story of the wayward daughter who on her death-bed dreams that she is among the worshippers; and its beautiful pen portraiture of her funeral to the village churchyard. The pathos of the work is, however, relieved by the pictures it gives of the happiness of the domestic circle as we see it ; for example, in 'A Bairns' Burns Anniversary,' and by some admirably-written passages on such subjects as ' Churches and Church-going ' and ' Books and the Reading of Them.' The volume is one that will be treasured by all who know a really good book when they find it, and it is manifestly from the pen of an author who does not write for mere writing's sake.\" \u2014 Dundee Courier and Dundee Weekly News. \" The art of making something out of nothing is a rare accomplishment and hard of attainment. This art George Umber undoubtedly possesses. Alongside of Barrie-like touches are delightful transcripts of human life and experience, and fine bits of genial wisdom. Such a sketch as ' Uncle Venner's Reminiscence,' the story of a boy's conviction of sin, is almost perfect, and anybody who knows anything about what Scotch life was will at once recognise its truth and feel its charm.\" \u2014 Glasgow Herald. \"In My City Garden is a thoughtful book, beautifully written and illustrated. From its charming pages there exudes a fragrance a-; from some homely flower, it is almost too good to be popular ; but those who read it once will read it again, and give it an honoured place on their library shelves.\" \u2014 Dundee Advertiser. \" This dainty volume of 200 odd pages is a work marked by cultured thought, keen observation of Nature, skill in analysing the human heart in its varied moods of joy and sorrow, and that quiet repose in literary expression which is as artistic as it is lucid and homely ; its twelve full-page illustrations being by no means its least attractive feature.\" \u2014 Glasgow Evening Times. \" This volume should find its way into many homes all over the country.

He is a Glasgow man at any rate, for his topography unmistakably suggests somewhere north of the Necropolis and within sound of the Tron chimes.

The illustrations by Mr. Findlay are admirable.\" \u2014 Glasgow Evening News. \"Altogether, these essays, which among other matter, treat of leaves and blossoms, birds and children, books and religion, mortality and immortality, form the purest and most delightful of reading, written as they are in a terse and forcible style, and transfused by their sacred human ingredients with a homely charm. The illustrations, which are evidently the result of much painstaking study, are a strong point in the book, and greatly enhance its value.\" \u2014 Kilmarnock Standard. \"Though this book comes under what Englishmen contemp- tuously designate as the ' literature of the kail-yard,' and though, as its title implies, it has literally more claim to that designation than the works of Barrie and Ian Maclaren, yet the author has impressed his personality on his writing so very distinctly that there is hardly enough common ground on which to institute a comparison. Like every true Scot, Mr. Umber is reflective and imaginative, extremely susceptible to the influences of Nature, and passionately attached to his native country. The loving way in which he touches upon the contents of his garden during the different seasons, and the lively descriptions he gives us of his children's tea parties show the inherent kindliness of his dis- position as well as the undercurrent of pathos, accompanied by real humour, that flows through all his work. His acquaintance with and quotations from the poets of Nature afford us anolher proof of his imaginative temperament and thorough culture, of which every line of his exquisite sketches confirms the possession. It is, perhaps, more a matter of personal taste than anything else, but we were most strongly moved by ' Uncle Vernier's Remin- iscence,' and 'The Kitchen Scene,' the latter almost equalling Barrie at his best ; while the whimsical humour of ' A Bairns' Burns Anniversary ' is delightful from whatever point of view it is regarded.\" \u2014 Daily Mail."], [266, "4 \"We hope that in this pushing, shouting, go-ahead age the musings osthis pleasing and stimulating writer may not be over looked.

In these eminently human sketches, limned fancifully on the background of a city garden, George Umber has many things to say to us on the motley show-box we call life. He has the merit of going deep without becoming dull, of floating his wisdom in the media of a true humour, and garnishing all with much apt quotation and allusion to what is best and most abiding in literature. It is the kind of book which leaves no nasty after-flavour, and causes no undue nervous strain. The reader closes its pages, feeling that it was good for him to have been here ; that the thoughts and mental poise which can alone reconcile men, looking with clear eyes, to the fitful ' variorum ' of human existence have been strengthened ; and in the things which make ' life worth living ' he has been much enriched. The book is illustrated, and after a very un common fashion \u2014 insight, grip of conception, and freedom from conventionality being the dominant note.\" \u2014 The Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald. \" In My City Garden, by George Umber, has afforded us as much pleasure as any volume we have read for some time. The title gives not the most remote idea of the work. There is certainly a reference to a city garden, presumably in Glasgow, and the difference of such a garden and one in the country is dwelt slightly on ; but in the ordinary sense of the word, there are no instructions as to cultivation of plants and flowers. The work is a collection of thoughlful sketches, instructive and enter taining, well calculated to make readers think and treat of subjects much more elevating lhan ordinary 'current topics.' We wish there were more books like In My City Garden, and topics treated in such a genial spirit.\" \u2014 The Ayr Observer and Galloway Chronicle. \" Our reason for noticing what is, in our opinion, a contribu tion to this (' kail-yard ') class of literature, is that it comes from the pen of a worthy Glasgow practitioner \u2014 Dr. William Findlay, of Dennistoun \u2014 who has occupied the leisure moments of a busy life in this excellent way, and who has already a literary reputa-"], [268, "6 tion. On the whole, Dr. Findlay has accomplished his difficult task \u2014 that of idealising and giving interest to the commonplace incidents of suburban life \u2014 with great success, and at places his style, we think, is equal to that of Barrie or Watson. ' The Kitchen Meeting' and 'Uncle Venner's Reminiscence' are as good as anything of the kind we have read. A number of the illustrations by the author's artist son show great promise.\" \u2014 The Glasgow Medical Journal lor April, 1896. \" In My City Garden may be commended as a series of genial essays, written with a light hand and enlivened by many personal reminiscences, sometimes touching, and sometimes amusing.
