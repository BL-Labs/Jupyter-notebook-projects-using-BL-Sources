In fact, Lucy had not got rid of her undesir- able obligations ; she had only shifted them, and they haunted her persistently. If she could but have forgotten them, she might have been tolerably at ease again, particularly after Celia had assured her that Jem was only crying 'wolf with regard to his circum- stances, that they were no worse than they had been nearly two years before. There seemed a perversity about Lucy's long memory in this matter ; for though she did not like Tony North any better than she had ever liked him \u2014 rather, if possible, shrank more VOL. III. B"], [14, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 2 from him \u2014 she could not in fairness say that he had, as yet, taken any mean advantage of the relation of debtor and creditor, in which they now stood to each other. But she had ceased to feel that the relation was rendered quite light and tolerable because she had merely borrowed a sum of money that in his eyes and Celia's was a trifle. When she thought the matter over for herself, she could not agree with them in their arithmetical philosophy. What did it signify whether the amount of her debt were five or five hundred pounds, when she could no more pay the smaller than the larger figure ? Certainly there was more possibility of Jem's interven tion to discharge the five than the five hundred. But she had not begun to see any opening in the cloud of adversity which hung over Blackhall, that could give her courage to confess and appeal to Jem, while she lived in the vague, yet earnest, hope of such an opening occurring. She could not endure to think that she was to continue"], [15, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 3 always in Tony North's debt, even for so paltry a sum as five pounds. Lucy was sensitively alive to the indignity implied in the change of her tone to Tony, though she was aware that it was her guilty conscience which had brought it about. She scrupled at contradicting him ; she lived in dread of offending him. She consented to go everywhere with him and Celia, until she was constantly to be seen in their company, and rarely to be found absent from them. Well, after all, that was not worse or nearly so bad as having it commonly said of the girl that she met the objectionable man, who was ten years her senior, alone, by appointment, and that she was in the habit of walking with him, unaccompanied by her sister, at unsuitable hours, in undesirable places. At the same time, Lucy's perpetual association with the two others lent colour to the earlier report, and was taken as abundant evidence that she had her full share in the intimacy, neither withdrawing from it nor testifying in any B 2"], [16, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 4 other way her disapproval of it. Lucy Endi cott could not have said that it was Tony North who extorted the submission from her. It was her conscience and her cowardice together which did it. On Tony North's part he was persuaded, for some time, that he was behaving remark ably well to Lucy Endicott. He was treating her with a degree of consideration and for bearance that surprised himself, with regard to which he did not know whether to feel a little proud or a little scandalised. He had not the same kind of respect for her which he had for Celia, but he liked Lucy better. She was never ' dooced ' impertinent to him, as he told himself her sister was sometimes, brood ing over what passed between them, and working himself into a rage before he made the admission. Lucy really did nothing to provoke him, since she had left off sitting puritanically upon him and shunning him. He was half of opinion that he could have found it in his heart to forgive the debt she"], [17, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 5 had incurred to him, and to refrain from making his own out of it, had it not been for three things. He was afraid that Celia Endi- cott would sneer and laugh at his simplicity and magnanimity \u2014 whatever she liked to call it. Oxcleeve was so confoundedly dull, that he must contrive some amusement for himself. There was his cousin and host, the self- righteous parson, whom Tony hated with a robust and genuine hatred. Miles had elected himself Lucy Endicott's defender and avenger. Very well, his muscular Christian ity should have something to guard against and avenge. He should see how Miss Lucy had turned tail, how she played into the enemy's hand, and was as clay moulded by the potter. The occasion which presented itself to Tony, rather than was selected by him, for the display of his power over his victim, was the Pony-drift, held just below No Man's Leap, to which all the world in the Oxcleeve corner of the moor went in August."], [18, "6 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Such a sight was not to be seen out of a land of wild horses. Upwards of five hundred mares and their foals were sought out and surrounded on the moor, till they could be driven by the moormen, and the ponies' owners or their representatives, into a walled enclosure, in which mares and foals stood in such a panting, pawing, tumultuous crowd as a herd of cattle present, on a much smaller scale, when they are deposited, sorely against their will, in railway trucks or on the deck of a steamer. The object of the gathering and stampede was that each mare, colt, and foal should be branded afresh, or for the first time, so as to be known by the moormen of the district ; the branding consisting of a small slit made in the ear, in which a coloured bit of tape was inserted and fastened. The operation, done quickly and skilfully, was probably not so trying to the animal as the action of securing it, which of necessity pre ceded the branding. A couple of men seized the struggling creature by the fore-legs, and"], [19, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 7 threw it on the ground, holding it there till the deed was done. The spectacle drew together scores and hundreds, not only of those intimately con cerned in the performance, but of gazers with no particular interest in the work \u2014 not even in local horseflesh \u2014 though every small farmer and quarry-master owned at least a dozen of these ponies, whose keep cost so little, summer and winter. People came a good many miles, still more than on the annual dragging of Delaval Pool \u2014 to stand at ease, singly or in groups, to sit on horseback, or in such car nages as Lady Jones's pony phaeton \u2014 with the strongest of springs and the surest-footed of ponies, equal to long detours over moor land tracks, rather than roads\u2014 or to perch unsteadily on the neighbouring dry stone walls, and remain for hours watching each pony as it was laid hold of, overcome, and operated upon with the swiftness of great surgeons in hospital theatres, and let loose to flee back to the wilds. Verily, as Tony North"], [20, "8 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS said, Oxcleeve was barren of public amuse ments out of the hunting season, when the Pony-drift was so largely attended. One attraction was a cloudlessly fine day, with a buoyant atmosphere. Another was an opportunity for the circulation of much racy and spicy local gossip. Frank Briton claimed colts ' that were none of his'n \u2014 sewer.' ' Ned Veale's owd meare's bones were a cuttin' o' the zkin, though he had passed his word to her owd master that her would be ztabled all the winter ; but ne'er a ztable the mear had zeen, and for a diet of oats and turmits, to which Ned had zworn, zissels and burdock were the best the pewer beast had zmacked.' ' Could any man tell for zertain whatten price Luke Tredinnock had wormed out of that zofty Tom Le Grice, when Tom's zow were at Truscoe Fair? ' 'What were the meaning of that 'ere black eye Luke had half hidden under his billycock hat ? ' Still the main charm to the mass was akin to what causes the popularity of hippodromes"], [21, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 9 and circuses \u2014 an experience always stirring, though a trifle monotonous, and by no means novel to the residents in the neighbourhood. There was the chance of looking at the multi- tude of ponies, black and brown, white and grey, and studying their unstudied snorting and stamping, rearing and plunging \u2014 the last two feats having the excitement of danger to the ponies' fellows in the drift, and to those of their masters who were impressing the sign of bondage on their subjects, to be borne even in the comparative freedom of the moor. How highly that freedom was prized by the more than half-wild creatures, might be seen by the hot haste with which the branded ponies, liberated after the branding, threw up their heels, shook the dust from their hoofs, and scoured away like the wind to the remotest fastnesses of bleak tor and grey boulder, prickly furze and tangled heather. If the sight was not nearly so good as a bull fight, a bear fight, even a dog fight ; not so high-bred and inspiriting as a meet and a run with the"], [22, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 10 hounds ; not so coming-home to a man as a boxing- match \u2014 at least it was more than a match for any show in the Agricultural Hall of a great city. The humour of the situation belonged largely to the captives let loose ; such pathos as it held was to be found in the pairs of mares and foals trotting up to the goal, or wedged together inside the barriers. Lady Jones recognised the pathos if no one else did, as she sat with her lonely heart looking out of her grey eyes, which shone so strangely under her white hair, watching the poor mares in their own scare, whinnying still to their terrified foals, and licking them over with encouraging caresses. George Fielding, keeping more apart than had been his wont from his kind, could not help regarding Lady Jones with intent interest, and divining what was passing in her mind. He did not attempt to join her or to speak to her beyond a passing salutation, but he was near enough to see another expression, a"], [23, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR n comical look flit across her face, and to hear her gravely ask the vicar if he had seen Benjie Gear in the throng ? Benjie would not be absent from such an assemblage. George wondered she could hazard such an allusion, till he remembered that the Dart moor legend of the man transformed into a pony was as widely spread as legend could be, and figured in every comprehensive guide book. The Eev. Miles had no difficulty in taking her up, and pointed to a colt with a particularly wicked eye, as his ideal of the bewitched or bewarlocked Benjie. Lady Jones had invited Lucy Endicott to go with her to the drift ; but Lucy, who had begun with being much pleased by the atten tions lavished on her by her brother's tenant, appeared to have adopted Celia's attitude to the widow. Lucy did not, indeed, take um brage at the notice bestowed on her, but she put Lady Jones off with excuses and evasions ; yet here was the girl with her sister and Tony North present at the drift, after having walked"], [24, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 12 the four miles of rough road, which was far too great a pull on her slender strength. Lucy was content to stand apart with the two others and make herself as conspicuous as Mrs. Lacy's sisters were making themselves. One of these young ladies was engaged to be married, and had her future husband in attendance on her ; while the great aim of both her and her sisters seemed to be to show how unblushingly a bride elect may show ofl the captive of her bow and spear, in the eyes of a gaping world. Celia's and Tony's jests, to which Lucy listened eagerly, and at which she giggled loudly, could hardly have been so inane as the time-worn pleasantries on the ponies' ear rings which were being bandied between the betrothed pair ; but the very pungency and cynicism of the former ought not to have been their recommendation to any happy, kindly, healthy-natured young girl. Lady Jones looked wistfully at Lucy. Certainly a change was coming over her ; she"], [25, "PONY-DRLFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 13 appeared at once flushed, exhausted, and wilful. Celia, in one of the richly-tinted darker dresses from her judiciously selected and care fully preserved wardrobe, looked as well as usual ; but Lucy had a deteriorated air \u2014 she was more than ever startlingly like her poor mother in the days when Mrs. Endicott was beginning to lose self-respect and hope. Even Lucy's dainty frock, in which she had looked so fair the first day she wore it, for which she had paid so dearly, had not stood a little strain on its qualities. It had not been cherished with Lucy's old neatness and tidi ness, or else it had been wasted in her long walk. It was crumpled and out of order, and its vanishing delicacy of hue and fragility of material were entirely unsuited for such an occasion as the Pony-drift. The vicar only glanced at Lucy in the company of his cousin, and kept at a distance from her, while his brow darkened. He was engaged in dodging Mrs. Reynolds, who"], [26, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 14 loomed in the vicinity of her clergyman and her friend Lady Jones, unmistakably anxious to point out to both the objectionable con junction of Tony North and the Endicott girls. Iiucy never looked at Miles North, and acted as if she remained unconscious of his presence, though his cousin, to whom nothing and nobody were sacred, stood at her elbow, and it was not likely that in the subjects for his blighting ' good things ' he left out the vicar. Jem Endicott lounged about in his ordi nary solitary fashion, until he became suddenly conscious that his sisters were behaving in a manner which marked them out from the other young women present. He marched up to the trio, drew Lucy a little aside and spoke to her, with what effect he alone could have told. The play of faces was plainly visible, and the dialogue could be easily guessed. In point of fact he was saying sternly, ' Have done with this tomfoolery, Lucy. What do"], [27, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 15 you and Celia mean by making a show of yourselves with that blackguard jackanapes ? You have never moved a step from this spot since you came ; but have stood grinning and giggling till people are beginning to ask what it is all about, and to point at you. I will not have it, I tell you.' But Lucy stood at bay and defied him, to his amazement ; probably to her own. ' I don't know what you mean. Let me alone, Jem,' she insisted, with shrill peremptoriness. ' It is no business of yours ; nobody will accuse you of taking care of your sisters, and making yourself answerable for them. Whom should I be with, if not with Celia ? And Mr. Tony North is very \u2014 very obliging and amusing. I'm sure we're much obliged to him ; as Celia says, I don't know what we should do without him. You are perfectly aware we have no acquaintances to meet and walk about with, as other girls have. Who was to blame for that in the first place, I wonder ? '"], [28, "16 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Jem stared stupidly, and Lucy, agitated to the verge of tears, was going back to Celia to save herself from making an exposure of her feelings in the middle of her sham gaiety. ' Look here, Lucy,' said Jem, in a more conciliatory tone, ' there is Lady Jones over yonder, in her trap. She has been kind to you, can you not go to her ? ' ' I don't know anything about Lady Jones,' retorted Lucy pettishly, ' neither does anybody else, and I for one don't want to, because Celia won't have anything to do with her. You yourself have not so much as called on her once, though you would have no hesita tion in throwing me upon her good offices. It is horrid for me always to have to find excuses for you and Celia. No, Jem, I can take care of myself. We are not doing any harm, whatever the friendly charitable com pany may think ; and, as for entertainment, we are doing pretty well, thank you.' Lucy was gone, and was, the next moment, singled out for Tony North's most marked"], [29, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 17 attentions ; he was evidently rallying and teasing her on her brother's interference. Poor Jem, baffled in his single attempt at discipline, slunk away with a hang-dog air \u2014 the more forlorn, no doubt, for the reason that the Pony-drift was no occasion for a school-holiday, and there was no little Kitty Carew on the ground to hold her own side of the question, and not permit him to do any more than haunt her footsteps doggedly. Lady Jones could bear it no longer. She caught the vicar's eye, and made a beckoning sign to him. He came to her immediately. ' Will you do me a favour, Mr. North ? ' she entreated earnestly. ' Will you go to Miss Lucy Endicott, and tell her I beg her to come over and speak to me. Or, if you do not care to interrupt her conversation with your cousin,' she made an anxious amendment, ' will you give me your arm and take me to her?' The vicar was silent for a second, and then he said stiffly, like the gentleman he vol. in. c"], [30, "18 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS was, ' There is no occasion for your making an effort from which I can save you. I will deliver your message to Miss Lucy Endicott.' He made his way to the two Endicotts and his cousin, the sender of the message fol lowing its bearer greedily with her eyes. The clergyman took off his felt hat with that exaggeration of politeness which men gene rally assume when they are forced into an encounter and compelled to act against the grain. He did not propose to shake hands with either of the sisters, nor did he take the slightest notice of his cousin, who stood grimacing at him, after the fashion of an unrepented prodigal, a degraded and defiled satyr. After a brief good-morning to the Miss Endicotts, Miles addressed himself directly to Lucy, speaking shortly and a little haughtily without being sensible of it. ' I am here, Miss Lucy, with an invitation from Lady Jonas for you to join her.' Lucy turned white and red, and trembled"], [31, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 19 visibly, while she glanced, with a desperate appeal, at her companions. Celia continued to smile unconcernedly. Tony North said very softly and inno cently, but with a certain emphasis, ' Tell the vicar and her ladyship you are very well where you are. We are selfish, we don't want any meddling with our nice little party \u2014 do we ? ' ' Be so good as not to dictate to Miss Lucy Endicott,' said Miles, in a still higher and mightier tone, and with rising heat. ' She does not want your help.' ' Oh ! don't she ? ' remonstrated Tony, almost sotto voce, with sweet incredulity. The effect of his remonstrance was elec trical. Lucy did not delay a minute longer. She was like a child hurrying to obey the prompting which she durst not resist. She spoke sharply and flippantly, using, as nearly as possible, Tony's very words, not being quick to find others, and not feeling that any change of words would lessen her pain and c 2"], [32, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 20 shame, which were ready to crush her in the dust the moment Miles North left her to her fate. ' I am very well as I am. I don't wish for any change ; I \u2014 I don't care to be interfered with.' She paused, and then added, as if from herself with the irrestrainable querulousness of weakness tortured to the last gasp, ' I refused to come with Lady Jones to the drift \u2014 am I not to be left to do as I please ? Why can she not let me alone ? ' ' Bravo, Miss Lucy ! ' exclaimed Tony with open, jeering triumph, when Miles turned his back. ' You have given them their conge with a vengeance. I predict you will not be troubled by my worthy cousin and the rich widow any longer.' Lucy moaned in her heart. ' Oh ! why did I say that ? There was no need to be rude and insult him and Lady Jones when they only want to be kind and good to me. I have affronted and got rid of my best friends \u2014 Jem's tenant among them. But I"], [33, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 21 cannot help it ; there is no use in trying to help anything any longer.' Accordingly, Lucy kept laughing hysteric ally for ten minutes after Miles North had felt it due to himself to say, ' I have to apolo gise for appearing officious,' had lifted his hat, stepped back, and was gone, in his pale imperturbability, to the person he had come from. He did not need to tell Lady Jones the result of his mission \u2014 she knew without being told. Both were silent. At last, as he still stood by her side, with his hand grasping abstractedly the front bar of her carriage, a greater hubbub than before arose among the imprisoned ponies. An obstreperous small pony succeeded in leaping the barrier. It had a wide field for its career. It did not run between any man's legs, or disturb any body's equanimity where a sense of personal danger was concerned ; but it was pursued by half the men in attendance, while the attention of the spectators generally was laid"], [34, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 22 hold of and engrossed by the animated pur suit. Even the engaged couple stopped their confidential conversation to watch the chase. Ceha and Tony North looked round and gazed with the gazing mob. Only Lucy never turned her head. The vicar, though a man and a Devon shire man, was soon satisfied with his in spection of the episode. He seized the opportunity to unburden himself to Lady Jones, and to clear himself from what mea sure of blame she might impute to him. He drew nearer to her, and she bent down to hear what he had to say. ' I suppose you think I ought not to keep that fellow hanging about here,' he said abruptly and harshly, pointing his meaning by an unwilling glance in Tony's direction ; ' but if I were to turn him adrift to-morrow, and let him loose elsewhere, where he could do a great deal more harm to himself and others, it would not matter. If it were not my scamp of a cousin, it would be somebody else.'"], [35, "PONY-DRIFT -AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 23 At first she made him no reply ; then she said a little coldly, ' Don't interfere with your domestic arrangements on my account, pray,' as if it was round her that the gadfly was buzzing. ' These Endicott girls are infatuated and incorrigible,' he burst out passionately, unable to restrain himself. ' They have been warned repeatedly to no purpose. It would tempt one to believe there was a doom hanging over the family.' If he had looked at her while he was speaking, he would have seen a quiver pass over her flesh, but he was too full of his subject. She answered at last in a low disturbed tone, ' I cannot tell you how and why, but I am convinced Lucy is being sacrificed. She is not acting of her own free will. I feel as if I could cry out, \" Is there no one to inter fere and save the poor child ? \" She is so sweet sometimes, and she might be so good if she got fair play. I ask myself if it is part"], [36, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 24 of my punishment \u2014 you know we have all offended and incurred punishment in our day, in one way or another,' she explained a little confusedly and wildly \u2014 ' to sit by and see her likewise perish, with no power to prevent it.' In any other cause he would have been struck by the strangeness of the speech, and would have stopped to analyse it ; as it was, he went on gloomily : ' What can you make of a woman who declines to be rescued ? She refuses to be saved, sweet as she is, good as she might be. Now, suppose there was a rescuer ready to risk everything he prized for her sake, his credit and usefulness, his very duty to his Maker. He would be a bold man,' he added hastily, with a half-shudder, and yet an indefinable longing in his voice, 'who would think twice of Lucy Endicott. Don't they say the girl is the picture of her mother ? ' He was arrested and taken aback by the sudden, suppressed anguish with which, let ting the reins fall on the ponies' necks, she"], [37, "PONY-DRIFT\u2014 AN AUSTERE YOUNG VICAR 25 clasped her hands together, and said in a choked voice, ' Oh, poor mother ! whose very likeness is fatal to the child you bore and loved.' Louder shouts than those which had gone before them rising over the moor, showed that the renegade was caught, and about to be dragged back to receive its deserts, and there was a cessation of the interest which had centred in it. The vicar's conversation with Lady Jones was brought to an abrupt conclusion, leaving him with an uneasy impression, highly dis agreeable to a man of his temperament, that he had been betrayed, of all persons, by Lady Jones, in whose discretion he had put faith, into saying a great deal more than he ought, and making something of a fool of himself What had she to do, sending him to reclaim Lucy Endicott, and drawing him into a dis cussion about her afterwards ? The personal soreness blunted his perceptions for a time to another conclusion to which, thinking over"], [38, "26 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS the scene, he came ultimately \u2014 a conclusion similar to one at which George Fielding had arrived some time before, in reference to the identical person \u2014 ' That woman must have had great trials and sorrows of her own, to be moved as she was by what she conceived the wrong done to another \u2014 to a stranger.'"], [39, "27 CHAPTER XXVHI. SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF. The long-delayed thunderstorm bursts in the end over town and country ; the bolt, sus pended for a space, falls at last ; the cry of ' wolf ' is no longer a purely mischievous, or a nervously apprehensive feint, but the des perate sign of an appalling reality. As hap pens frequently in the experience of most of us, the elaborate preparation for the encounter was of no service, save to lull to sleep under a false impression of continued security, fears for which there was only too solid a founda tion. Sally Beaver had been summoned by Beaver to aid in his field work. Beaver had Jem's authority for spiriting his wife away, at any moment, on his and his master's business"], [40, "28 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS \u2014 a privilege which the girls had resented and resisted to the best of their ability, in vain. A cow on the moor \u2014 the only cow kept for the use of the family \u2014 had hung out a signal of distress, and wanted a woman to see to her ; for, as everybody knew, and Beaver remarked in agreement with the general opinion, 'women volk but pewer company for men volk, as a rule, were main handy when cow-ill were going round ; nor were they to be despised when a man was laid on the flat of his back with summat.' In the absence of Sally on her proper mission, if a knock came to the front door of Blackhall \u2014 luckily such an event was rare \u2014 somebody had to open the door. As that somebody was never by any chance Celia, not even though she might be sitting within ear shot, idle or only singing at the top of a voice, which, though it had received some traininc, was rather powerful than agreeable, Lucy was wont to go gingerly, and opening the door a couple of inches, ask who was there ? She did"], [41, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 29 this even when Jem was within doors. He was ample protection from burglars \u2014 if they had thought Blackhall worth a visit in broad daylight \u2014 and as for anything further, he would have contented himself with giving his sisters a contemptuous glance, which would have said as plainly as glance could say, ' You are not even good for opening a door ; yet you take it upon you to despise women who can do that and a great deal more,' and then tramped down the stair, through the hall, and opened the door himself without more ado. Celia would have let him, but Lucy would not suffer it if she chanced to be in the way, she was too quick for him in this. She scrupled to open the door herself, but she scrupled still more that Jem should open it. If Jem could have seen it, there was something, not sensibly but foolishly pretty, in the way in which Lucy here put herself shrinkingly, shamefacedly, but still staunchly, in the breach before him. Lucy opened the door on this September morning when there was more than dew, there"], [42, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 30 was already silver hoar-frost hanging on the fast-fading ruby bells of the fuchsia hedges, and the berries which the birds were still sparing on the holly-stack. Through the two inches of the open door, she found herself face to face with a pair of the most civil working men in their Sunday clothes whom she had ever had the good fortune to come across. ' By your leave, Miss, we must see Squire Endicott,' said one of the pair deprecatingly. ' We begs your pardon, Miss, for intrud ing,' said the other, adding, with much con sideration, ' But if you will be zo good as to show us into the kitchen, we will give as little trouble as we can.' Jem was out, but Lucy was so pleased with the good manners of the strangers, that she had less reluctance than she might otherwise have felt in tripping before them into the kitchen, and trying in her blundering way to make them comfortable.

Both of the servants have gone out,' went on poor Lucy, taking Beaver on as a purely house ser vant, which she was wont to do in a vague, not intentionally deceitful, fashion, when she was pressed on the question of the numerical strength of the domestics. ' But one of them will be sure to be back presently and will let you have a jug of ale, and bread and cheese.' ' No hurry, Miss,' said the one man cheer- fully. ' Never mind us,' chimed in the other modestly and affably. ' Us will attend to our selves and not be in your way \u2014 not no more than we can help, Miss.' Lucy went up to Celia with the story that she had never had to do with two more civil men \u2014 she hoped they had been sent by some body to buy some of Jem's live stock. She had heard him say to Beaver the other day,"], [44, "32 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS that he thought cattle dealers and drovers had forsaken the place. ' What are you saying, Lucy ? What are the men like ? ' asked Celia, sitting up in her chair, letting one of Tony North's books slip to the floor and speaking with more interest than might have been looked for from her. ' Very civil are they ? Have they begun to wag their tails, lick their lips and roll their eyes ? ' ' Ceha, are you out of your senses ? Wag their tails, indeed !

I beg your pardon, I was thinking of tigers when they are pre paring to make mincemeat of their keepers. \" The Philistines be upon you, Samson.\" De pend upon it, Lucy, you have admitted the bailiffs.'

'No doubt,' said Celia, picking up her"], [45, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 33 book. ' I believe that is their way till they are crossed. They are most commendable in seeking to gild an odious trade.

' You would not speak in that cool way if \u2014 if it were come \u2014 Jem's ruin, you know, which we have all been fearing so long.' Celia shrugged her shoulders. ' What would you have me to do if \" Jem's ruin, you know,\" were come ? ' 'Do you think I might ask the men?' suggested Lucy in a trembling voice, growing pale with the daring of the proposal. ' Do you think they would tell me ? ' ' If you like. Yes ; I dare say they would tell you, if they had no motive for concealing the truth.

If so, you may tell them that they will get very little here \u2014 your bangles, silver thimble, and so forth \u2014 that is worth the trouble of carrying away. The idea of burglars in the forenoon, knocking at the front door and asking for Jem, did not recommend itself to Lucy's limited imagination, so that it had no deter rent influence on her. She departed, and was able to return and shut the sitting-room door before she broke into a passion of tears. ' Now, Lucy, if you are to howl I must retire and shut myself up in our room.' Celia calmly stated the alternative. ' It would be more to the purpose if you told me what you said and what the men said in reply.' ' You are r-right,' acknowledged Lucy, through the sobs she was struggling to sup press, speaking in a voice of despair. ' I just said, \" Oh ! if you please, are you the bailiffs?\" and one of them said, \"That is"], [47, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 35 about it ; I'm sorry for you,\" and the other said, \" Well, yes, Miss, we be ; \" and oh !

' But to think I d-did it. I \u2014 his own sister \u2014 brought this on poor Jem,' and Lucy gave way anew to a tempest of weeping. ' You ! Do you really think your miser able little bit of debt, which Tony North paid weeks ago, would have brought down the bailiffs on Jem ? Did ever anyone hear such preposterous conceit and vanity ? ' Celia's ridicule and contempt had the effect of a cold bath in recovering and composing Lucy after her paroxysm of distress. ' No, it is not that,' she said more quietly, ' though I would give the world I had not bought that horrid frock and those other things ; but, Celia, it was I \u2014 I,' breaking down again, 'who opened the door.

I might have called to you and you might have helped me ; we might have closed and barred or locked it and kept the \u2014 the bailiffs out till Jem knew, and had time to think what he should do.' ' You are an idiot, Lucy,' said Celia, with conviction. ' What good would it do to keep out these civil men, the bailiffs, when they have the law on their side ? If they ever had the door shut in their faces at Black hall, which from all I have heard is extremely probable, it was not Jem who performed the feat. He has not enough spirit. Besides, men and manners have changed. I believe bailiffs, like agents, were once counted good game. In the west of Ireland, for instance, they were shot down freely ; but even in Connaught that would no longer be tolerated without causing a row.' ' Then what is to be done ?

' Why, nothing ; that grand resource of impecunious people who live in houses and can't pay the rent, or support families on in- comes which do not exist. It is very hard to fight against a policy of doing nothing. I put myself to the trouble of telling you some time ago that it was not a great addi- tional misfortune for bailiffs to be in posses- sion. Speak them fair and they will not dis- possess you. Indeed, they cannot till all the creditors agree as to what is each man's share, which they are not likely to do, though there is honour amongst thieves. Tony North has told me of people who lived and enjoyed every luxury for years with the bailiffs behind the scenes. I dare say Tony was drawing a long bow, but there is something in such statements. If Jem had any tact and enter prise, he might make his own of the accident.' Lucy was, in a general way, as easily up lifted as she was swiftly cast down in her"], [50, "38 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS confidence with regard to what was about to happen to the family. But she had a strain of honesty in her which prevented her from taking refuge in this sanguine philosophical view of affairs. She was driven to suggest, reluctantly and haltingly, Mr. Tony North. He had helped her in her difficulty, might he not be able to lend temporary relief to Jem ? ' What ! convert Tony into a family bene factor ? ' cried Celia, with one of her ringing, piercing laughs. ' How can you be so mean, after the manner in which you have all treated him ? Poor dear Tony, to be so taken advan tage of! One never expected to have to re gard him as a victim to his generosity and magnanimity. It would better become you, Miss Lucy, to think how your little debt is ever to be paid now. You don't mean to say that you have modestly made up your mind to its never being paid ? That is all very well for you, but I am not certain that Tony, in spite of his gallantry, will put up with it.

' Oh ! he would surely never be so cruel ; it would be too hard on poor Jem as well as on me,' lamented Lucy, reduced once more to the deepest despondency. ' I don't see that it could matter much to Jem, as things are,' said Celia unfeelingly. ' Not to know that I had taken on things, and kept it from him ; and borrowed the money to pay for them from a man he does not like ? ' said Lucy, repeating each of the enormities under her breath, and with scared, guilty eyes. ' Of course it was shocking of you,' said Celia, pronouncing the condemnation with great relish in the middle of the lightness with which it was uttered. ' Why, Celia, it was you yourself who urged me to buy the frock and things, and afterwards suggested that Tony North might lend me the money to pay for them,' remon-"], [52, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 40 strated the unhappy Lucy. 'Don't you re member you said it was such a trifle that nobody would think anything of it ; every body would laugh at me for making an outcry about it ? ' ' Did I ? ' asked Celia unblushingly. ' I suppose you had come round me, as people say, and played on my good nature to take pity on you. But when I think of it, I see I was mistaken on more than one point. For instance, it makes it worse instead of better that you should have done it for such a beg garly sum, like the man in the Bible who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage. Dear ! dear ! to incur indelible disgrace \u2014 if it were ever known \u2014 and offend Jem past forgiveness for four pounds ten ; not much more than a girl who has a decent allowance of pocket money might give for a Persian kitten or a piping bullfinch.' Neither did Jem put the arrival of the bailiffs in the advantageous light of a blessing in disguise. His manliness certainly prompted"], [53, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 41 him to affect stoicism, and even to express relief at the close of the long, hard fight, and sickening suspense, in which despair had always loomed larger than hope, but that was different from Celia's tone of frank con gratulation. After an interview with the men below, he came up to the sitting-room where the girls still were, and walked without a word to the farthest window. He stood looking out at nothing in particular, apparently, with his back to Celia. and Lucy, for what were, to Lucy, several agonising minutes. Then he turned round and said harshly : ' I suppose you girls know who are down stairs, and that there is the end of it, just as I told you ? ' ' Oh ! Jem, I am so sorry for you,' said Lucy, through her fast falling tears. ' There is no good to be got by turning on waterworks,' said poor Jem impatiently, with little either of graciousness or grace. ' Will you be so good as to tell us what"], [54, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 42 good there is to get, and where we are to get it?' said Celia with a cutting voice, as if his way of meeting the crisis provoked her quite as much as Lucy's tears annoyed him \u2014 as if she looked on him in the light of the person to blame for their poverty. Unquestionably she did so, by whatever queer distorted logic she contrived to do it. ' None that I know of,' said Jem sullenly ; ' I don't know anything you two can do ; you must find out that for yourselves.' He walked over to his table and the desk which held the accounts over which he had so long pored and pondered in vain. He locked and double locked the desk and pushed back the table as if he meant to have nothing more to do with them. He turned round with a weary, hope less expression on the face which had not looked young for many a day, and yet was not so very much older than those of the girls opposite him. ' So far as I am concerned,' he said drearily, ' I could be glad it was all over. As for you two, you must think what is to"], [55, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 43 become of you. I shall try to get work of some kind, and you may share my wages ; but it is not at all likely that they will content fine madams, even if they will keep you from starving. Perhaps you had better go back at once to the relations you came from and see what they can do for you, since I shall ask no help from them.' Celia sat swelling in bitter resentment, injured, insulted, because Jem could not manage like other men, like other bankrupts, to main tain the women of the family \u2014 not even after the wretched fashion in which he had kept them for the last year and a half. Lucy slipped away and actually braved Celia's wrath. The Endicotts' misfortunes were past con cealment, past retrieval ; Jem had said it ; and Lucy had no notion that he would change his mind \u2014 she had no conception of the artful devices by which persons of spirit, as Celia would have put it, mask the presence of bailiffs in the house and go on the owners' way not minding, and expecting their friends and"], [56, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 44 acquaintances to be equally inobservant and oblivious. Lucy herself was in mortal terror of the ' wolves in sheep's clothing ' whom she had introduced on the premises \u2014 though it was a crumb of comfort that Jem had never asked who let the men in, or signified that, if he had been apprised of their coming, he would have fought them off to the last drop of his blood. It showed how profoundly Lucy was moved, and how her emotion caused her to forget herself and to overcome her natural timidity, that, having secured her hat and jacket, she slipped on tiptoe downstairs, through the hall and out at the front door, either as if she feared that the bailiffs would suspect her of carrying off what tables and chairs the Endicotts had left, or as if the men might consider the very clothes she wore to be Jem's property, which she was not at liberty to convey out of the house beyond the officers' scrutiny. It was true that her frock and hat belonged to Jem, if they did not belong to Tony North, in lieu"], [57, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 45 of that other frock and hat which she had learned to hate. Lucy was bound for the Court ; she did not care in her roused feelings what Celia might say ; Lucy did not even mind what she recollected perfectly well, that she had behaved very badly to Lady Jones at the Pony-drift ; she did not know how her ladyship might receive her. But the knowledge and the un certainty which accompanied it, that would have rendered Lucy passive and helpless in ordinary circumstances, went for nothing on the day when Jem was ruined out and out, and there was nobody to whom his sister could go to seek advice and aid for him and herself and Celia, save his tenant, who had shown herself willing to befriend the family, whom Lucy had rewarded with neglect and rudeness. Lucy had not to wait long to learn how she was to be met by the mistress of the Court. Lady Jones must have seen the girl hurrying across the Green, almost falling over the geese that came in her way, in her preoccupation"], [58, "46 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS and haste, for by the time she had opened the wicket-gate the mistress of the house was half- way down the flagged path between her mock balsams, golden feathers, ribbon grass, and autumn phloxes, in spite of that wavering, feeble gait of hers which had pathos in it when one looked her in the face. She had been able to nerve and steady it when she sought to track the Spanish Madam to her favourite haunt ; now Lady Jones's walk was that of painfully feeling for, clutching at and scraping the ground in her eagerness to traverse it. But her white face, luminous eyes, and half open lips were all full of welcome. ' What is it ? ' \u2014 she spoke first. ' Something is amiss and you are come to me \u2014 that is right \u2014 let me get back to the seat in the porch and then tell me all about it.' Tottering as she was, Lady Jones put her arm round Lucy as if to support her, instead of taking the support she needed herself, and drew her within the porch. Lucy was only too glad to sit down on one"], [59, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 47 of what Celia had called ' beggars' seats,' and not to mind the passers-by, the ubiquitous geese, Zecchy and Lovey coming to the draw well, and what was more formidable, the large aggressive figure of Mrs. Reynolds, which might at any moment tower like a Colossus in her gateway and threaten to descend on her neighbour across the Green. Naturally Lucy was very careful of appear ances ; but she felt inclined to throw them to the winds, when by this time either Beaver or Sally must have re-entered the kitchen at Blackhall, been made sensible of who had now a better right to be there than Squire Endicott and his servants had, and must be primed with the melancholy news which, if it were not already all over Oxcleeve, would be discussed in every cottage before nightfall. ' I am afraid I startled you, my dear,' said Lady Jones gently, as if she were calling her self to order ; ' but I saw by your face you had something to say. Now, take your own time to say it. But first, did you eat your"], [60, "48 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS breakfast this morning? Is there anything you could take to refresh you ? There is wine in the side-board.

' No, no, you are too kind, I don't deserve it,' stammered Lucy. ' Never mind what you deserve ; it does not signify to me,' persisted Lady Jones, in an inconsequent, reckless fashion. ' But I don't want anything ; I ate my breakfast the same as usual \u2014 we did not know then ' And with that the pent-up torrent of words and tears burst forth as incoherently as might have been expected. In the mean time the two contrasted figures, forcrettincr everything in their earnest conversation \u2014 the"], [61, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 49 white-haired, white-faced widow in her heavy black weeds and the yellow-haired, pink cheeked girl in her flimsy girlish dress \u2014 sat. framed in the grey porch of the old Court, where many an Endicott had sat discussing their troubles long before the days of Gentle man Greenaway, where the Spanish Madam herself might have found shelter from the cold. Outside the garden gate, the geese stretched their long necks, poked their heads through the bars, and peered curiously at the confer ence, preserving an unwonted silence as if loth to disturb the tete-a-tete. ' Oh ! Lady Jones, can you tell me what to do ? ' began Lucy. ' I must work for myself whatever people may think of me. I can't live off Jem's wages when he is reduced to taking wages, and when there is a chance of our starving, for then I know he will not eat a bite that we may have enough. Nothing can save him, and I shall have helped to kill my brother ! ' ' I do not understand you,' said Lady Jones, VOL. III. E"], [62, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 50 in a maze. ' There can be no question of starving, or of saving your brother. As to working for yourself, nobody worth minding will think any harm of you for doing so. Between you and me, I wonder you and your sister did not try it a year and a half ago. You and I see some things in a different light. However, you need not do it unless you like, though of course it depends on what you call working,' and a peculiarly happy smile flitted for an instant across Lady Jones's face. ' I know I am silly,' said Lucy meekly, ' but Celia agrees with me here. The world looks down on girls who go out as go vernesses,' persisted Lucy, who could rarely get quit of a rooted idea and was seldom capable of entertaining more than one at a time. 'I never thought of having to spend my days in shabby school-rooms, have to walk last into other rooms, dine when families lunched, and be invited into drawing-rooms to play when people danced.' Lucy ran mournfully over the list of small grievances"], [63, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 51 and humiliations, while Lady Jones could hardly refrain from another smile, but man aged to suppress it in order not to hurt her companion's feelings. ' People have to bear worse than that in this world,' she ventured to suggest mildly. ' Oh, yes,' owned Lucy, but she showed herself a little aggrieved at her catalogue of woes being depreciated. ' People are a great deal poorer than that, then they go and do wrong frequently, and there is no end to the misery and suffering all about \u2014 one sees that even in Oxcleeve, nobody needs to be told of it. Still, I do not know how my sister and I are to bear what we have to put up with,' went on Lucy, ' for Celia is very proud and has a great deal of spirit, as you may have found out.' ' I should have thought that it would have been all the other way, and that her pride and spirit would have helped her to work for herself,' said Lady Jones slowly. ' Oh, no, Celia's pride is not that kind of E 2"], [64, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 52 pride,' explained Lucy glibly. ' Besides, as I said, we never dreamt of such a thing. We had no reason to expect it, and it is really very hard, when we are squire's daughters, like Milly and Nettie Barnes. All Miss Pen- fold's pupils were not squires' daughters, they were mostly the daughters of doctors and lawyers. We did suspect that one of the girls was the daughter of an hotel-keeper, which was very wrong. I don't mean that she could help it, but she ought not to have been sent to Miss Penfold's among the rest of us ; and I do not believe that she was even going to be a teacher,' ended Lucy, as if this fact implied an additional indignity. ' Well, that may say something for the gentility of teaching,' hinted Lady Jones. ' It was perhaps some of the better- class girls who were training for teachers.' ' No, indeed,' said Lucy with conviction, ' the pupil-teachers were a class by them selves \u2014 I think one of them was a poor lady, but another was the Miss Penfolds' niece, and"], [65, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 53 a third was the daughter of the writing master. There was a fourth for a short time, and she was the daughter of a surgeon, she said, but we were almost sure he was a vete rinary surgeon. She was very close and very pushing, and it was evident she meant to rise in the world.' ' Very commendable,' argued Lady Jones, ' if she understood rising in the world in the proper sense.' There was a moment's pause and then Lucy admitted ingenuously, ' I am sure I don't know how I am ever to do it \u2014 teach, I mean \u2014 for though I got prizes for elocution and English and French dictation in addition to those for good conduct, and I have kept up my painting as well as I was able, I was never one of the head girls at Miss Penfold's. I was not like Celia \u2014 she always says I am stupid. People may find me out and not have me for a teacher.' 'There are worse things than being stupid,' said Lady Jones quickly. ' Not that"], [66, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 54 I think you stupid \u2014 you were very clever about the schoolgirls' sewing the other day.' 'That was only sewing. There is no cleverness in sewing,' said Lucy. ' I don't know that. You may be sure of this, there is some use for you in the world, else you would not be here \u2014 only don't be too particular. Even squires' daughters have to make themselves useful sometimes in ways they did not always foresee. They may be thankful when they can make themselves use ful in any way, ay, in standing at a washing tub or in being a scullery-maid. But what has put all this into your head to-day ? For give me for asking,' exclaimed Lady Jones, getting a little excited in her turn. ' Has your brother been speaking to you of his affairs ? It is no secret that he is in embar rassed circumstances.' ' Oh ! Lady Jones,' cried Lucy, recalled to the extremity of the situation, ' the bailiffs are at Blackhall.' ' The bailiffs ? ' said Lady Jones, starting"], [67, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 55 up as if she were young and strong enough to rout a host of bailiffs, and then sitting down again exhausted. ' Oh ! poor fellow. That must be seen to at once. Why did you not tell me in the beginning ? Does George Fielding know ? Has Jem sent for him ? What is he doing ? ' Lucy stared, startled by the rush of ques- tions. ' I am anxious to be of service to you,' said Lady Jones hastily. ' I am a great deal older than all of you and I am your brother's tenant \u2014 that is one tie between us, is it not ? ' Lucy did not stop to ask herself why Lady Jones should care so much, though she was a friendly middle-aged woman, Jem's tenant. Lucy was not even offended in her little punc tiliousness by the unceremonious directness of the style in which she was assailed for further information. ' Jem says it is all over. This is the end,' said Lucy, with a fresh gush of tears. ' No, it is not all over. This is not the"], [68, "56 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS end,' said Lady Jones firmly, rising to her feet again and preparing to enter the house. ' It will all come right in time, if you Endicotts will let it. I thought you would have to wait till a life lapsed, but this must be seen to at once \u2014 there is no time to lose. I am going to order out my ponies and drive over to Ash ford to speak to Mr. Fielding. Will you come with me ? I shall be glad of your company \u2014 I am always glad of it. I hope you under stand that.' Lucy thanked the woman who had been so kind to her and so patient with her, won dering a little vaguely, yet drawn to her in a manner the girl could not resist. But she would not go to Ashford if she could help it ; with or without Lady Jones she had shrunk from entering the town, for reasons of her own, for a number of weeks. She felt as if Mr. Bliss and Mrs. Denny must know all about her mode of paying their bills, and might expose her at any moment. She was by no means sure that Jem would not be angry with"], [69, "SURLY JEM COME TO GRIEF 57 her for repairing to Lady Jones on such a day, on such an errand. She dreaded lest Celia should discover where she had been and what she had done. Lady Jones went alone to Ashford and Lucy hurried back to Blackhall \u2014 not knowing very well what to think. She was sure that she had a friend and that friend meant to help and save the Endicotts, but she did not see how it could be, she was not able to believe that Lady Jones's help could be of much avail when Celia had never cared for her or had any faith in her, and when Jem had said of the family fortunes, ' It is all over. This is the end.'"], [70, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 58 CHAPTER XXIX. ' JEM MUST BE SAVED.' It was market-day in Ashford, but George Fielding happened to be for the moment alone in his private room, where Mrs. Reynolds had interviewed him one morning in spring. It was now autumn, and in the interval a good deal had come to pass in his private conscious ness where the tenant of the Court was con cerned. And at this instant the said tenant was shown into George's office. He had told himself for some time that he must be prepared for anything, and the sequel proved that he had made the reflection to some purpose, for he put on a calm face im pervious to scrutiny. He received his visitor with quiet politeness \u2014 installing her in his chair, in which she sank back in bodily"], [71, "'JEM MUST BE SA VED ' 59 weariness. He went out quickly and told the clerk whom the information chiefly concerned, that Lady Jones had private business with him and that they were not to be interrupted on any pretext whatever, not though Sam Russel brought his lease to be looked over, or the Horlocks were come to pay the interest on their bond, or Kit Hedgeland were to turn up with the missing paper in his lawsuit. Then George Fielding returned to Lady Jones with measured steps, not because he was assuming deliberation, but because he was forced to delay the encounter for a minute or two longer. In spite of his self-control and the precautions, which were the result of being forewarned, he could not shake off a sense of the strangeness of reflecting who it was that was sitting in his room after time and change had done their work with un usual eflect \u2014 what it would have been to him fifteen years ago to know her there, and what his father would have thought of her presence ! His father had not known how to regard"], [72, "60 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Joanna Endicott. He had not been without favour for her ; he had been just to her in her adversity. At the same time he had been repelled by her \u2014 as what father would not have been repelled by the girl who had re jected his son ? \u2014 for whom, at the same time, she would have been anything save a desirable match in the eyes of the world. The next moment George was standing before Lady Jones seeking to reassure her, while she was rapidly recovering herself. ' Can I do anything for you ? ' he asked. ' I have given directions that nobody shall be shown in here, if you have business with me, as I take it for granted you have.' ' Thanks,' she said, in her clear, full voice, ' that was good of you. It is not my business entirely, it is other people's as well \u2014 yours among the rest,' with a faint, fleeting smile. Then she went straight to the point. ' You are agent for my landlord. Have you heard that the bailiffs are at Blackhall this morning? ' He had not heard ; but, in the double"], [73, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 61 consciousness under which he was labouring, he could not for the life of him think so much of what the advanced stage at which Jem Endicott's troubles had arrived would signify to him, as of what it must be to her sitting there to know that the bailiffs were at Black hall this September morning. He roused himself and told her that he had not heard, but he was not surprised at the news. He was afraid it was the beginning of the end. ' No,' she said, contradicting him flatly, ' that shall not be if I can prevent it. Sit down and consult with me about what is to be done.' He sat down mechanically at her bidding, and waited for her to say more. ' Jem must be saved, come what may, George.' His heart gave a great throb and beat more violently than it had done for a dozen years. He thought she was on the eve of re vealing her personality, if she had not revealed"], [74, "62 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS it in that speech ; but her next words un deceived him. She had evidently no intention of taking him into her confidence, unless the step were inevitable. The use of his Christian name was a mere slip of the tongue which might easily occur, and be unperceived by her, when she was pre-occupied and agitated. Indeed, it had happened before in similar circumstances, when they had been conversing together in reference to a startling incident which he now knew had concerned her nearly ; and in his ignorance he had treated the blunder as possibly the result of unconven tional habits and familiar tricks of speech acquired during her earlier life in the colonies. ' You are aware that I take an interest in the Endicott family, Mr. Fielding,' she was saying, much more formally, as if she were making a preconcerted explanation. ' But perhaps you do not also know that I am rich and cannot tell what to do with my money. I am willing to advance what is necessary,"], [75, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 63 on proper security, of course, to relieve my landlord in any way you think best, but it must be done quickly. Lucy ran across to me this morning. They are in great distress, which they must be spared as soon as it can be managed.' It was his turn to smile a little. The speech was so like a woman's, he told him self, and yet she had it in her to act with a man's energy and determination. ' I formed my own conclusions as to your command of money when you took the Court in the condition in which it stood,' he said ; ' but I am sorry to tell you, as a matter of duty, that Jem Endicott's circumstances are all but desperate. The man who has put in the bailiffs \u2014 I think I can guess who it is, though I am not absolutely certain \u2014 is only one of many heavily-involved creditors who will follow suit.

It is clear he cannot live on at Blackball without stock or implements or such furniture as the house contains. The place must be let, if anyone will take it in these wretched times for agriculture, for the behoof of the creditors, and poor Jem and his sisters must shift for themselves elsewhere.' He put the reasonable side of the question plainly before her. She listened to him patiently, and then she said,' ' But you don't know how much money I have or how much I am willing to lay out in this matter. I could lift ten thousand pounds without any trouble \u2014 would that do ? I think you could sell out shares for me which would bring in about five thousand more.

' Lady Jones,' he said quietly, trying her, ' do you think that either I or any other respectable lawyer would allow you to fling ten thousand pounds into the sea or the fire to gratify a passing fancy ? You spoke of proper security. There can be no proper security when the land is little worth in these times, and such as it is was mortgaged to its full value long before its present possessor succeeded to it.'

' I object to you or any woman \u2014 man, when it comes to that \u2014 undertaking, with my consent, an obligation you must know little or nothing about.'

Her voice gave way a little as she made the statement, and he was sensible that, under the force of what he felt, he had been speak ing, as it might sound, harshly to her. He resumed more gently : ' I do not for a moment dispute your right of spending your money as you think fit ; I have not the smallest title to do so. All that I want is to give you my candid opinion on one of those business mat ters with which you, like most ladies, may not be very well acquainted. The expression of my opinion is gratuitous, I dare say, since do not believe for an instant that my friend Jem Endicott, whom I have always reckoned honest and honourable in the middle of his misfortunes, would agree to such a sacrifice"], [79, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 67 from a woman on whom he has no farther claim than that of her landlord and friend.' ' Do you mean that he would not take the money \u2014 which I am so willing to give him, when I ask him \u2014 from me ? ' she inquired piteously. He was very sorry for her, though she would not trust him, and though, after the first false step, he could not tell how many more she might have taken. He hated him self for that admission, but he could not help himself, as a man of the world. It was all very well to have faith in her still, but in point of fact her history was a blank to him. Still, of this he was certain, that whatever she might have done or left undone, she was blameless in her desire to confer this benefit on her own flesh and blood. ' I don't see that he can or ought to take it,' he was compelled to say; ' but of course I'll convey to him your most generous but \u2014 pardon me \u2014 reckless proposal, and if I am not mistaken he will dismiss it at once, with F 2"], [80, "68 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS more or less of the gratitude he owes to you. Poor Jem is \u2014 well, not the most gracious of mortals, but he is not such an ingrate as not to recognise the great service you would fain render him.' He was trying to comfort her, racking his brains for convincing, soothing arguments on his side of the question. ' Were he to consent \u2014 and I do not know that in this case you might not be rendering him a dis service \u2014 bringing down on him a curse instead of a blessing \u2014 \u2014 ' ' You may leave me to decide that,' she interrupted him coldly. He went on apparently without heeding her. ' What I was going to say was that in all probability you would only stave off his ruin ; it would be a question of time merely. The debt which has been his destruction all along would be there intact, in another form which he would be doubly bound to strive his utmost to repay.

He has never had a fair chance, as you say, and he is as frugal and industrious as any hard-headed colonist ; but he is also self-willed, dogged in the extreme, and, I suspect, old-fashioned in his ideas.' He plunged into another objection. ' If Jem were so far left to himself as to become your debtor to a large extent, with very little prospect of clearing off the debt in a reason able time, I don't suppose it would be an advantage to his sisters, as you may imagine it would. I conclude you are interested in the whole family,' said George, trying to speak easily, taking up a bundle of papers and fingering them in an unsuccessful effort to appear still more at his ease. ' I have ob served that you have taken a liking for Lucy ; well, she would be much better away from Blackhall. Neither of the sisters can get any good there. They are in an awkward posi tion, and under bad influences.'"], [82, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 70 ' I know what you mean,' she said sharply, ' but I cannot think it possible that the man has any real hold on either of the girls, least of all on Lucy. Indeed, I have reason to think that if her heart has been touched it is not by him \u2014 he is the last man she would think of. The intimacy must be Celia's doing.' He said no more. He did not wish to distress her further, and he felt that he had no right to betray Lucy in what he had merely suspected \u2014 however strongly \u2014 in reference to the appearances of the Spanish Madam. Lady Jones was silent also, with the shadow deepening on her white face and her great grey eyes looking straight before her. It was as if she pursued his train of thought and followed it into regions which he dared not invade, taking up broken links and slipped threads which he had forgotten or could not bring forward. What did she not recall of an abandoned post, forsaken ties and duties, an evil example afforded, the forfeiture of all"], [83, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 71 claim to interpose and protect those who were worse than defenceless ? He could not endure to look any longer at her sitting there with her bowed head and feeble feet. He hit on another objection. ' Jem might even think himself at liberty to indulge a foolish passion. He might marry Kitty Carew, if she would consent.' She turned upon him swiftly. ' And what if he did ? ' she demanded haughtily. ' Jem is free to please himself so far as I am con cerned. Is he not even to have his choice in a matter in which the poorest working-man holds it as his dearest right to choose ? You have surely lived long enough in the world to know that there are much worse things in it than a young man's marrying a girl whom he cares for, facing the world with her, fighting the battle we all have to fight with her by his side.

The sarcasm died out of her face and voice the next instant, and in its place came a tender remorse and a wistful reverence. ' Except,' she cor rected herself slowly, ' that I do not know much about the Carews, how they bore their name, while I can give my testimony that one Jones carried his so that it was held in honour throughout a great colony. Kitty Carew,' she began again in her former earnest, dis passionate tones, ' is clever and fairly educated. She has done her best for herself and all be longing to her. She is not a silly, helpless, vulgar creature who thinks only of self-indul gence in some form, and defines a lady as a woman who wears fine clothes, eats good food, and is idle. Kitty Carew would not wreck Jem's fortunes in that way.' ' No, I don't think she would,' admitted"], [85, "'JEM MUST BE SA VED ' 73 Fielding, while he had some difficulty in throwing off the speculation in which he had been indulging while she was speaking \u2014 what sort of man had the late Sir Benjamin Jones been that he could have won such a warm testimony from such a woman ? ' I don't say,' he remarked aloud, ' that Kitty Carew would not make a good wife as she has made a good daughter, and I have sufficient confidence in Tom Carew, whether his name may have anything to do with it, as an honest independent fellow who would not stand in a daughter's way or trouble a son-in-law. But that is not to say that she would be a suitable wife for Jem Endicott, or that this part of the county would see it to be so, far less that his sisters would be able to pull along with her, supposing she were put over their heads and installed as the mistress of Blackball. They would not have to do with a mistress of straw in her, I can tell you. Little Kitty would be the true mistress wherever she went.

' But Jem ought not always to be sacrificed for his sisters, without getting the least credit or thanks for it,' she spoke again, not only with firmness, with something like passionate indignation. As George Fielding listened to her, a vision presented itself unsolicited to his mind. It was that of Delaval Pool frozen over with ice, inches thick, in midwinter. A good many skaters had assembled from considerable dis tances \u2014 among them a smallish schoolboy at home for his Christmas holidays ; as it hap pened, the last holidays he ever spent at home. He was in company with his elder sister, a big girl. The two attracted attention by the feats they performed on the ice. Clearly, the boy who had been out in the world in his schoolboy fashion, and knew more of skating than the big girl who had remained at home had acquired, was the eager instructor, while she was the apt pupil. The boy Jem had been very proud of his sister's acquirements in the matter of circles and spread eagles, and"], [88, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 76 of the fact that he had imparted them. He had exposed himself to some rallying on the subject from a young Cantab who was on the ground and knew the pair, and had watched them with interest. The college-lad on his way home to Ashford had again come across the brother and sister walking back through the frosty twilight to Blackball. Their merry talk rang on the evening air long before he saw them. The boy was carrying both pairs of skates slung round his neck, the girl, in the gathering dusk, had her arm over his shoulder. George roused himself with a start from his involuntary reverie to watch Lady Jones ; she too had her reverie with knitted brow and compressed lips. Was she asking herself if she had returned a stranger in her prosperity and undergone unspeakable anguish for nothing ? Was she turning about in her mind whether to save Jem and Blackhall \u2014 supposing there were no other way \u2014 she must cast aside the accidental disguise with which"], [89, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 77 time, absence, and suffering had furnished her, tell plainly who she had been, and risk forfeiting for ever even the slight hold she had on her family ? For the Endicotts were an undisciplined, inconsiderate race, and Jem was one of the most headstrong and perverse of the number. It was quite possible that no recent prosperity on her part and willingness to share it with them would prevent him from repudiating his sister, refusing to forgive the scandal and shame she had helped to bring on her family, and declining to touch a penny of the fortune which he might persist in regard ing as part of the wages of her disgrace. He might denounce and defame her as her own father had done, and put a final end even to such intercourse, on mistaken premises, as existed at present between her and him and her sisters. That would be to bid a last fare well to such a desperate illusion as George Fielding could conceive an unhappy woman's indulging, of watching over her people from a little distance, befriending them without their"], [90, "78 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS suspecting it, doing it under the fiction of common acquaintance, of Jem's tenant \u2014 an eccentric, rich, and childless widow, showing favour where the fancy took her, always at hand to come to their aid in worldly trouble like the present, or in the yet more personal and tragic episodes of sickness and death. George Fielding could not satisfy himself whether Lady Jones had come to a decision sitting there in his private room, or whether, as he was more inclined to think, she left her self to be guided by the course of events. He only knew that she sighed a dreary, heavy sigh, and then got up and spoke as if to mask the sigh, for she had not been a woman who had accustomed herself to groan and weep either over her trials or her errors. ' Very well, Mr. Fielding,' she said, with a successful effort to recover her calmness. ' There is nothing more to be said or done just now. You will let Jem\u2014 my landlord \u2014 know that I am desirous of lending him money to relieve him. That will be better and more agreeable"], [91, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 79 for all parties than if I were to communicate with him personally. You will make me acquainted with the result as soon as possible. But remember, whatever happens, the bailiffs must be got out of Blackball without loss of time.' She clung with a woman's tenacity to her purpose in spite of every argument to the contrary. Her mind even showed an affinity to Lucy's, in her blind terror at the pacific bailiffs. Lady Jones had not to wait long, not even for George Fielding's writing or riding over to Oxcleeve to give her the substance of his communication to Jem, and Jem's reception of it. Jem became his own messenger and called on his tenant at the Court. It was the first time he had accomplished the common civibty. It was also the first time he had crossed the threshold of Blackhall since the bailiffs had bestowed their company upon him.

Lady Jones welcomed him with a palpi tating kindness which put both him and herself out.

She would have had him sit down in her chair. She would have waited on him in what must have been Aus tralian bush fashion, but he would not sit down at all \u2014 still less would he be waited upon. He stood, with his hat in his hand, beneath the portrait of the late Sir Benjamin, and hardly even looked at her. ' I do not know what to say, or how to thank you, Lady Jones,' he began awkwardly. ' Of course it is wonderfully kind of you even to think of such a thing ; but how you came to think of it \u2014 what put it into your head to make such an offer \u2014 I cannot comprehend.'"], [93, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 81 ' Never mind what put it into my head,' she said breathlessly, standing beside him with her limbs trembling under her, ' since it is there.

' Fielding has only done what he considers to be his duty,' said Jem gruffly. But she thought she had moved him a little, that there was a lurking hesitation and hankering after her proposal under his stolid manner, even when he said slowly the next minute, ' How could I take your money, Lady Jones, when there is hardly the most distant like lihood of my paying back the principal in the course of our two lives ?

I can do without the interest and let it lie over and accumulate with the rest, if it is the payment of that which alarms you. I shall never miss it.' ' Impossible ! Don't talk stuff,' growled Jem, in the most natural manner in the world. She saw that she had gone too far, but she was also sensible that she was tempting him \u2014 for his own good, she believed. He was conservative to the last fibre of his nature. He had clung to Blackball when he had nothing else to ding to.

He would have given his life to have kept the old place. He would willingly have gone on grinding and pinching to clear it from its overwhelming burdens, as he had been doing for years now.

Should he shut his eyes and accept the goods the gods had sent him, or should he trample them under foot as a trap for his credit, his peace of mind, and self-respect \u2014 a manifest snare of the Devil ?

She put up her hand as if to ward off a blow too late, and drew a long, pained breath. ' I do not feel like a stranger,' she said in a low, hurt tone. ' You have let me take the Court on my own terms, you have received me at Blackhall, your sister Lucy has con sented to be my friend, and surely it is not either giving or receiving charity to suffer me to lend you money on a bond with reasonable interest.' He stood silent, immovable, except that, having none of Lucy's footstools to kick out of his way, he mechanically kicked aside a news paper which was lying on the floor. He was evidently debating the question, and so sore was the struggle within him, that the sweat drops stood on his brow. She, too, was agitated beyond conceal ment. She had sunk into a chair and been sitting opposite to him during most of the dis-"], [99, "'JEM MUST BE SAVED' 87 cussion. Now in her excitement she rose and stood again beside him. At that moment, in spite of her feeble gait, white hair, blanched face, and widow's dress, the family likeness between the tall man and woman with the straight brows, dark eyes, and noses of the same Roman type, standing side by side in the old-fashioned, plain, square room, which seemed a fit setting for them, was striking \u2014 far more so than any faint traits of resem blance which existed between Jem and his younger sisters. ' I am a very lonely woman,' she said, breaking the silence, and speaking with concentrated sadness, ' but I had once a brother, a schoolboy brother, of whom I was fond, who was fond of me.' He had given an involuntary start, and was looking at her keenly, searchingly, with something which resembled wild, fierce ques tioning in his glance.

Had it been otherwise, even the circumstance that he wTas doubly, trebly, fenced against such an impression, might not have saved him from a most mistaken and embarrassing suspicion. Jem was spared the affronting blunder. It would have seemed to him the height of sar donic irony where he was concerned, and the next thing to profanation in reference to the woman before him, to have indulged in the insulting supposition that she was the victim of a tender passion for a man considerably her junior \u2014 for him, Jem Endicott. As Jem was neither imaginative nor spe culative he rested in the conclusion that it was as Lady Jones had said. She was a rich widow, independent, alone in the world.

She would have been sorry, as she had told him, to see an old family and an old place parted. Such public-spiritedness was rare, but it was not unexampled. When George Fielding heard that Jem Endicott had come to terms with Lady Jones \u2014 evidently as Lady Jones, and not as a more privileged or forbidden person \u2014 he shook his head ruefully.

The presence of the bailiffs at Blackhall had not been more widely known than their speedy departure was noised abroad, and as the second circumstance was much more wonderful than the first, it had its due share of attention, while the explanation of the mystery \u2014 strange enough in itself \u2014 was shrewdly guessed, or leaked out somehow.

He mastered himself and came continually"], [105, "STRUCK DOWN 93 and consulted her, as he had never consulted anyone before, on his proper business. She gave him good advice, being herself a quick witted, observant woman of some experience, and did not season it with a grain of patronage or overbearing interference. There was no need that it should gall him. He could not avoid discovering, notwithstanding his self depreciation, that she liked to have him at the Court, that he was always welcome ; so he went and sat with her as the Rev. Miles North was addicted to sitting in her rooms, and as Jem had sat nowhere out of his own house before, except in the bar-room and parlour of the Furze Bush. He was not very lively com pany, and he could not say that be exactly enjoyed the performance, which was a novel form of constraint to him, but insensibly a degree of intimacy grew up between him and his creditor. He acquired a habit of appealing to her, and putting confidence in her as other people were apt to do. For without any con sciousness of the fact on her part, she had the"], [106, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 94 gift of being sympathetic and of inspiring confidence. It was not Lucy who quarrelled with Lady Jones for delivering Jem when he was all but checkmated. Lucy was not only heartily thankful ; she was secretly proud of the result of her interference. Her friend had saved Jem and all of them ; and she was ready to go to Lady Jones, every time she could get away from Celia, with sweet shy caresses, which her ladyship, though she was not naturally a demonstrative woman, returned with interest. It was Mrs. Reynolds who in the first place fell on her neighbour across The Green. Her large presence appeared positively to fill the Court, while she proceeded to hold up her black-gloved hands in amazement and protest. ' My dear creature, what is this I hear ?

' But you see I did not ask you, because I thought I was old enough to judge for myself,' said Lady Jones, trying to possess her soul in patience and to bear in mind that it was Mrs. Reynolds who had, however unwittingly, smoothed the way for her return to Oxcleeve, and her subsequent rescue of Jem and Black hall.

That Celia was not mortally offended by the pre sence of the interloper was a great point gained. Privately, Lucy was of opinion that Ceba was only too thankful for such an avail able reinforcement of the domestic forces, though she did say in an undertone while Lady Jones was still lying back in the first chair she had reached, undergoing the process of recovery from what was to her the enor mous fatigue of a small amount of walking,"], [131, "ON THE BRINK OF THE SHORELESS SEA 119 ' Was a sick and dying man not enough, that you should bring a dilapidated woman to fall iU here ?

George Fielding rode over every morning to inquire for Jem, and, when he heard who was installed by the sick man, sat dumb. From the date of that piece of information his offers to remain and sit up with the sick man ceased. He never even alighted from his horse, and so far from asking to see Jem, George did not even request to speak with one of the Miss Endicotts, which would only have been natural under the circumstances.

She was in her sensible dark Devonshire serge school-frock, jacket and black hat, exquisitely neat as usual, but with the word schoolmistress and not lady written all over her. Her small dark face was twitching with strong emotion, which she yet kept down by a Herculean effort. Her craving, imploring eyes, glowing with suppressed fire, cried without need of words, ' Is my Jem, my husband, the father of my child, abve or dead ? Is there any hope left for him and me?' Lady Jones had no thought of doing any thing, save hurry to her and save her heart strings from cracking. ' He is just the same."], [151, "WARRING RLGHTS 139 There is some hope still.

She had said, nevertheless, that she would hardly let him come near her, that she wTould have been willing to take their child and go out into the world to provide for it by her own unaided exertions, while she had nothing more to do with its father !

Any how it is certain Jem showed symptoms of amendment long before Oxcleeve had done ringing with the last scandal about the Endicotts, that Kitty Carew of the Furze Bush, the schoolmistress, was Jem Endicott's lawful wife, had been so for years, was the mother of his child, was acknowledged by him, and had taken up her abode at Blackhall."], [175, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 163 There were many people greatly exercised, among them Kitty's elder pupils, with regard to whom she must feel with strong compunc- tion and regret \u2014 for she was naturally a con- scientious little woman to the end of her career \u2014 that she had been a stumbbng-block and a temptation instead of the shining example they took her for. These well- grown, rosy-faced Devonshire lasses, still in pinafores and sun-bonnets like their little sisters, were fain, with pardonable infatua tion, to regard the mistress who knew every thing and had been so strict with them as the cleverest and luckiest of women. Mrs. Reynolds walked about from morn ing till night and waylaid Lady Jones every time she went to the Court, to represent to her that surely her eyes were opened now to the character of the Endicotts. To think that she had so compromised herself and her friends by going and living at Blackhall in order to help to nurse her landlord in his illness !

I have never visited except at Blackhall.

I could not cause my door to be shut in your face. I could not \u2014 no, I could not deny myself a shake of your brother-in-law's hand.' ' I know you told me you were odd,' admitted Mrs. Reynolds reluctantly, 'but that is bke a man saying he is poor, proof positive that he is rich ; and if shaking Greg Barnes's hand were all, he does not make it so scarce, unfortunately, that you need reflect upon yourself for that indulgence.' And then Mrs. Reynolds went off again on her friend's lack of comprehension. 'But there is one comfort,' the censor allowed, ' that your landlord has been a married man all the time, if it had not"], [177, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 165 been such a marriage, made known at such a time, shocking ! How could you bear to come in contact with the designing minx in whom our dear good vicar has been so deceived ? I cannot say I was taken in. I always thought it very ill-judged, to say the least, to take a young person, however well qualified and steady she might appear to serve her own purpose, from a village inn, little better than an ale-house, into a Church of England school. But the best of clergy men have their simple side \u2014 for that matter men in general are not to be trusted where dust can be thrown into their eyes by women, especially by young girls. I can remember my late dear husband's insisting on getting an order for the infirmary at Ashford and giving it to one of the pertest, flirtiest little fools in the place. If you will bebeve me, no argument of mine would put him past the blunder. \"My dear Adeline,\" he said, \" it is not the girl's morals I am looking after \u2014 I leave that to you \" \u2014 I need not say he trusted"], [178, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 166 me impbcitly \u2014 \" it is her liver which is seriously out of order, and cannot be properly attended to in her father's crowded cottage.\" As if she would have known that she had a liver, had she minded her work as she ought to have done.' Greg Barnes had a different version of Jem's marriage when he drove over from Barnes Clyffe to Blackhall on this occasion. He was able to get out of his carriage and walk the length of the hall, to which Sally Beaver brought him the strongest of her arm-chairs. There he sat like a grand old chief, and laid down the law to Lady Jones and Lucy, for Celia refused to come down and see him, and Kitty, whom the visitor pointedly asked for as ' Mrs. Endicott,' could not yet leave her husband to receive any guest, however honourable. ' So Jem is better, glad to hear it, and has taken home his wife ; he should have done that in the beginning, but better late than never. She is an honest woman, though"], [179, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 167 she acted a trifle indiscreetly, and Tom Carew is as honest a young fellow as is to be found in these parts.

Everybody knows that little pitchers have long ears. But I'll say this, we always swaUowed all there was to swallow manfully, ay, and womanfully, the moment we saw the sinners meant to turn over a new leaf and do better. The only thing I couldn't swallow was profane hypocrisy, and so I have never entered a church door from then \u2014 when there were no chapels in these parts,"], [180, "168 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS till now.

The two persons out of the family, the most affected by Kitty Carew's promotion, were George Fielding and Miles North. It was not that George could not conceive the possibibty of a private marriage and a small Endicott of another generation in the back ground ; such marvels, though they are commoner in fiction than in real life, had crossed his legal path before now. All that he could say was that he would not, if his suspicions had been roused, have freed Jem from a capabibty for such a piece of insanity,"], [182, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 170 but he could never have associated it with clear-headed, dutiful, punctilious Kitty, Tom's trusted daughter, the foremost scholar of her rank in the parish, the vicar's prize pupil and prize schoolmistress. George rather thought he was sorry for Kitty, though the draught had been of her own brewing, and be had some faith in her dragging Jem Endicott at her chariot wheels, and inspiriting him in the line of a more hopeful and successful career than he could have otherwise attained to. Perhaps this was little Kitty's mission in life after all, George owned, after he had screwed up his mouth for a long whistle, and shrugged his shoulders as high as his ears at the first receipt of the tidings. If Lady Jones did not find fault, nobody else was entitled to com plain, not even the cynic Celia and that strange morbid girl Lucy. If Lady Jones did not find fault ! Ah ! there was the rub. It was in connection with Lady Jones that George Fielding was so much struck by the discovery of Jem Endicott's marriage. In"], [183, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 171 George's excited state of mind on the subject, the unexpected revelation seemed the next thing to an interposition of Providence to turn away attention, both public and private, from the earlier mystery, and to help her, for good or for ill, still to preserve her incognito. Where was there room, either in Blackhall or out of it, for speculating on the extraordinary friendship which the widow of the late Sir Benjamin Jones had struck up with the Endicotts, leading her to devote not merely her money but her time and herself to the by no means popular or highly esteemed family, when everybody was gabbling about Kitty and Jem ? How they could have managed to get married in a church, and that at a place not so very far off, though it was in the wilds of Exmoor, so long ago, and not been found out ? When was she to make her first appearance in the village as Madame Endicott? Lawk-a-daisy! an ill-omened name as ever was, and what was to become of the few boarding-school misses ? The very geese"], [184, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 172 seemed to take up the tale and go about cackhng it with all their might. Miles North had looked as impassive as a stone when be was apprised of the defalcation of his teacher, but for the time he went no more to Blackhall. He did not congratulate Mrs. Endicott on her promotion, he did not condole with Lucy on her coming deposition as housekeeper. The truth was, he was exceedingly offended and mortified. Not only was he displeased by everything irregular and out of order, such as a mesal liance, or, worse still, a secret marriage ; he felt Kitty's transgression like a mockery of his authority, an insult to his judgment, and a scandal on his school. He hated to be found wrong, and in this case it was caused by the betrayal of the confidence he had reposed in another person. He had been proud of his young schoolmistress, whom he had in a manner reared and trained. He had put the utmost faith in her, and it did more than make him angry, it wounded him keenly"], [185, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 173 to find that from an early date she had deceived him. She had done much that he must condemn, and she had done it under the most aggravating circumstances, in conceal ment, under false pretences which rendered her life a be. She had also suffered him, in order that she might the better hoodwink him and the public, to maintain her in a position for which, as it was now proved, she bad been morally unfit. The simple fact of her presence in the school was an injury from the effects of which it would long suffer. It really seemed as if the Rev. Miles, not having learnt long-suffering in the character of a father, like Tom Carew, but being a man in office instead, would never, in spite of his good Christianity, be able fully to forgive his former protegee and fellow-worker. It added an additional sting to Kitty's offence in her clergyman's eyes that it should have been committed in connection with Jem Endicott of Blackhall. It showed the vicar once more in vivid colours how bttle could"], [186, "174 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS be expected from an Endicott, how untrust- worthy the whole race had been and how tainted root and branch. It was impossible to contemplate the bare possibility of calling Jem Endicott and his wife brother and sister- in-law, and of being brought into the close contact with them which the relationship implied. More than the clergyman's pride, his fastidiously honourable nature, his rigid moral standard revolted at the idea. It was no comfort to feel conscious that he had been trifling with temptation lately, to be called upon to pull himself up and to frame fresh resolves against yielding to his weakness in future. The last straw was contributed to the young man's burden of discomfiture by his cousin Tony's casting it in his teeth and evidently gloating over it. The two men were still at the dinner table, having just concluded a formal and far from genial meal, and Miles was meditatino a speedy retreat to his study without more marked discourtesy to his cousin and guest"], [187, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 175 than the host was usually guilty of. The necessity of practising occasional incivility in order to keep Tony in his proper place, was in itself torture to a radically well-bred man such as Miles North was, the foundation of whose good-breeding lay in his deep sense of justice and generosity. Tony began while he gingerly peeled a walnut, ' Queer lot, these Endicotts. Who would have thought the boor Jem would have been sweet on your prim little beauty of a schoolmistress, and what is more, sold himself for her ? ' ' The least is the best that can be said for him and her,' said Miles shortly ; ' but it is none of your business or mine, Tony.' 'I am not so sure about that, as far as I am concerned,' said Tony maliciously. ' In -spite of your benevolent warning I have got -a trifle mixed up with these Endicotts, to my ;cost.

' I did not know that you had five pounds"], [188, "176 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS to spare,' said the vicar dryly, staring a little at the same time, as Tony expected. Tony made a grimace. ' A fool and his money are soon parted ; but what can the most poverty-stricken wretch do when a bttle thing comes to him bathed in tears, and confides to him her little bills and her bear of a brother's niggardbness ? I do not think that even your reverence could have stood the test, especially when it was demure Miss Lucy, so chary of her savours when she has not an object to gain \u2014 trust her ! she knows what she is about, she is a sly little puss \u2014 who was the peti tioner.' ' Tony North,' said his cousin in a voice of scarcely suppressed thunder, ' I have har boured you for years now, but I shall not suffer abominable slander to be spoken at my table. A man who can be capable of repeat ing such a transaction when true is quite as capable of inventing it when false, which I bebeve it is, from the bottom of my soul."], [189, "PEACEMAKERS AND PEACEBREAKERS 177 For what rascally purpose you have told the story you can best tell.' Tony North's sallow colour grew a brick red, and he half started from the table ; but he controUed himself and sat down again. ' I am aware I am a poor relation and a hanger on,' he said with a vicious snarl. ' I suppose I must stomach the he direct along with a few more cousinly kindnesses of a similar description. The tables are turned, Mr. Miles, since my father helped your father to pay his debts and to send you \u2014 a horrid bttle prig you were then \u2014 to Rugby and Oxford.' ' Your father was a generous, honest gentleman, and so was mine. I have done my best to repay them both,' said Miles, looking the speaker full in the face. ' And I have employed the talents which a kind Providence has given me to disgrace the simple-minded pater, so much the worse for me,' said Tony, resuming his tone of insolent banter.

'Oh! but my Lady Jones has come out since then,' said Tony unblusbingly. ' She has paid the clodhopper's pressing debts \u2014 by Jove ! I wish she would pay mine. If I bad the faintest anticipation of such a delightful result I too would pay her every attention. I might even rival my clerical cousin in the number of my calls and the height at which I stood in her good graces. I could put up with a little croaking. I could even let her poke about me when I was ill, if such were her remarkable taste, like my friend \u2014 or enemy, Jem Endicott.'

' ' Wager on the chances of a woman's folly and ruin ? ' cried Miles, unable longer to contain himself. ' What do you take me for ? Do you think that I am such a one as your self?' He drew out his not over well-filled purse, took from it the only five-pound note it held, and flung it down on the table. ' There is the amount of your loan \u2014 if there ever was such a loan ; remember I don't believe it. I am convinced, if there is anything in it, you have twisted and misrepresented the truth till it is the worst kind of falsehood.

At the same time a greedy light came into his cunning eyes, and he wavered for an instant ; but rage, vindictive spite, and the desire to retain the means of galling bis cousin almost beyond endurance, carried the day. He tossed back the note and rose, putting his hands into his pockets as a preliminary step to strolling away. ' I am not come to the pitch of accepting bribes. Is the suggestion one of your modes of repaying my father's memory for his liberal deeds to you and yours in your need ?

There was something like a council of war held by Ceba and Lucy, at which Lady Jones ventured to be present on Lucy's eager invitation, but barely tolerated by Ceba.

Lady Jones had not compared notes with George Fielding, but she had arrived at the same conclusion, that Kitty, who had so long reigned supreme in her schoolroom and in the ' Furze Bush,' who had been wilbng to forfeit her claims as a wife, but only that she might carry off her child and be everything to it, would not, now that she was installed at Blackhall, prove a mistress of straw for Celia to set aside or ride over rough-shod.

The tug of war came the very first time Jem was able to contemplate facing the family at dinner. While he was set aside and his wife kept him company, Celia, with the pe culiar adroitness which always distinguished her where her own interests were concerned, had fallen into the habit of taking the head of the table, which Lucy, in the character of housekeeper, had formerly occupied, while Ceba waved Lucy to the master's place at the foot, because the most trouble in carving and dispensing the food was to be encountered there. When Kitty came into the sitting room to announce Jem's arrival and make arrangements for his comfort, which she did with the decision and composure of a wife of twenty years' standing, Celia was already seated in the place of honour, and kept it, to the distress of Lucy, who had sprung up willingly and taken another chair, which she 0 2"], [208, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 196 quitted the next moment to help to fix the screen which was to shelter the head of the house from risky draughts.

' And what if I don't,' demanded Celia, ' since I have more right to be here than you have ? ' ' That is untrue, and you know it. It is the very opposite of the truth.

He looked fearfully shrunk and wan, and curiously like Lady Jones, if there had been anybody disengaged enough to remark the resemblance. He had worked himself up to encountering the ordeal of returning to the family parly with the addition of Kitty, and of seeing that the addition was accepted.

Poor Jem, lumbering and slouching more than ever, heaved a sigh of relief. He felt as he had known instinctively all the time that he had found a moral backbone and stay on which to rest. That little woman opposite him would not only help him to rule his shabby kingdom, she would fight all his battles single-handed, win victory if victory were to be won, or render defeat bearable by the strong enduring mental fibre which would fail only with her failing breath.

Ceba, ignominiously foiled in her first and last attempt at utterly ignoring Kitty's priority, had far too much native sagacity to prolong a useless struggle, and persist in a losing game.

Lucy would not hurt a fly, as Kitty had observed on their first personal acquaintance ; nay, Lucy was shyly kind to her sister-in-law every time Celia's back was turned. In Celia's presence the hfe-long overwhelming influence of the strong-willed unscrupulous nature still carried the day, but in her absence Lucy, backed by Lady Jones, was beginning to assert herself and to free herself from her slavish bonds. She was fain to do it, because in the same breath with Jem's recovery there had come a shadow over the girl's life, something had gone out of it which she could ill spare, something which had cast a halo even round the days of remorse, terror, and trouble. There was a constant visitor at Blackhall during Jem's illness, who came no more on his recovery.

Kitty was right with regard to the other delinquent as well as to herself, that they had come out of the mess which they had made of their lives far better than they deserved. It was the Miss Endicotts for whom the arrangement of staying on with Jem and the wife he bad selected was so odd, and so likely to be jarring and unsatisfactory. The upper classes in the neighbourhood, though they had held the girls in scant esteem, were moved to pity them.

But it is true that you would spoil a saint.' ' No, no, don't you say so, or I shall not have any confidence in myself or comfort in life left. It is so weak and absurd to go about first tempting and then exasperating people.'

He had not been born at Blackhall, indeed, but he should have been, and he had now come to dwell in it as his home and his future inherit- ance. Little Hugh was a ludicrous small edi tion of his big father, doubtless of his grand father, if there had been anybody to recall the days of wild Hugh's innocence and help lessness.

It was certain that she, for one parent, would always be strict in her devotion to her child's highest welfare. No such embargo, either as to indulging their feelings or expressing their sentiments, was laid upon Lucy and Lady Jones. Lucy took refuge from her heart-sickness in suffer ing herself to sink willingly into the pro soundest depths of baby- worship. She was positively exultant when she accompanied little Hugh and his nurse on their first visit to Lady Jones at the Court.

She had lavished such toil upon him, wearing out eyes and fingers and youthful health and beauty in the late hours she had kept because conscience would not let her sleep, and she could give the time to him.

He had not been discomposed by her white hair and cap and her black dress. He had contented himself with sitting on her knee and staring solemnly up in her face. ' I never saw such a beautifully behaved child,' exclaimed Lucy in positive ecstasy. ' He is not angry with me, Lucy ? ' said Lady Jones, with piteous wistfulness. 'You do not think he is angry ? Oh ! if you only knew what a relief that is.' ' No, of course not ; he is not angry, he is not startled even, which would only be natural,' said Lucy, confidently and fluently.

At first she drew away her skirts from him, and gave him as wide a berth as she could. But the small creature paid no more heed to Celia's avoidance of him than to Lady Jones's lamentations over his head. He toddled to Celia's and Lucy's door and hammered on the panels as freely as to other people's doors. He carried his toys to her to be admired or repaired, as the case might be. with the most unquestioning faith in her attention to his wants. He proposed to climb on her knee, and went so far as to ask for a kiss from her. It is said little children and- animals always know, under whatever disguise, the people who really bke them and behave accordingly. It was not so with little Hugh Endicott.

' But he did not mind the shaking, or the finding his level, indeed he did not ; he thought it was part of a game and great fun. And do you know what Celia said when she saw him laughing ? \" That small urchin is fond of me ! \" She said it not only as if she was surprised and amused, but as if she was gratified ; I am sure of it.' ' Don't fancy such a thing,' answered Kitty, with a look of annoyance and alarm coming into her eyes. She did not desire her boy to fall, at however early a stage, under Celia Endicott's influence. Kitty's good judgment was swift to recognise that there was a weapon ready for Celia's hand, if she set herself to use it. She wished to change the conversation so far.

' Certainly, if I am not to have him break his neck or be drowned, while a whipping will do him no harm. I know his father will only threaten him, and a young child does not understand threatening. I must set about whipping him at once,' said Jem's virago resolutely. The child was a resource in such an awkwardly constructed household ; even Celia attained some perception of the fact. At the same time the interest and happiness, however restrained and soberly expressed, which her companions had in the small boy, irritated Celia, as the happiness of others, in which she"], [234, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 222 had so small a share, always provoked her and prompted her to administer sharp correc tions of pain and humiliation.

If she had no relations she had friends \u2014 intimate enough to come some distance to see her, and take up their quarters with her for a week ; old enough friends to have known her in Australia, an item which soon came to light. A lively interest was felt in the strangers, and Mrs. Reynolds called on them as soon as the etiquette in which she was a proficient would permit. ' Now we shall get at the bottom of dear Lady Jones's belongings and antecedents,' Mrs. Reynolds told herself, with a smirk of prospective satisfaction. ' These Australians"], [242, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 230 will be clever indeed if they baffle and bam boozle me.'

Dr. and Mrs. Baring were pj;tterns of respectability and discretion. Yes, they had known their friend Lady Jones for a long time now, and they had known the late Sir Ben jamin as well. No, he was not a very rough diamond. He was considerably older than his wife, certainly ; a plain, unassuming man, perhaps, but one of the most intelligent, as he was one of the best and most highly respected men in his division of the great colony. Yes, they had known Lady Jones before her mar riage ; indeed, she was married from their house ; that was because she was left alone : the relative with whom she had quitted England was dead. As they had known both Lady Jones and Sir Benjamin for some time, the couple had done the Barings the honour of being married from their house. Yes, it had been an excellent marriage for Lady Jones ; Sir Benjamin had been much attached"], [244, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 232 to her, as she was to him, and he had be queathed her the bulk of his fortune, while he had not cut off his nephews and nieces with a shilling \u2014 they had been handsomely pro vided for. Lady Jones did not break her rule about not seeing company when her friends were with her. She did not even take them to Blackhall, a bttle to Lucy Endicott's mortifi cation ; while Mrs. Reynolds's interpretation of the omission was that Lady Jones was ashamed, before her friends, of the singular cronies she had picked up, when so much better a choice had lain before her. From this circumstance, and from her domestic engagements, Lady Jones had been comparatively little with her late patient and his family for some time. There were points in common between Kitty and Lucy, though Kitty was strong as steel and Lucy was weak as wax. They were both diligent and dutiful, though Lucy's diligence had been somewhat paltry in its"], [245, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 233 results, and Kitty had made a great lapse from her duty. They were both exact and precise in their different ways, an exactness which in Lucy had degenerated into finicking habits, and in Kitty had taken the form of primness, with a dash of prudery. Kitty was much the more severe and sobd in her taste in dress and furniture, while Lucy was ad dicted to ornament and flummery ; but both had the instinctive, exquisite neatness which has something to do with a certain mental purity and propriety. They agreed splendidly on the half-window-blind question, and aided and abetted each other in supplying Blackhall with eyelids to all its eyes, from garret to basement. Kitty, with an accomplishment or two less, was far more thoroughly educated and better informed than Lucy ; but though Kitty could have undertaken to prove the baseless ness of a belief in ghosts, and the utter illogicalness of their having any abnormal existence in what is for the most part, to our"], [246, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 234 short-sighted eyes, the harmonious economy of the universe, she had not escaped the effect of centuries of isolated Devonshire supersti tions filtering down to the latest natives. She had not seen the ghostly dreariness of the moor at certain seasons, and heard the wind howling and shrieking over the vast waste to no purpose. She had not sat as a sharp little child in the ingle nook of the Furze Bush, and been a witness to the unbounded faith of the country people in the supernatural \u2014 heart-rending, hideous, or grotesque in its homeliness as it was represented by primitive folk with long heads, fierce passions, and glimmerings of inextinguishable tenderness in their common nature \u2014 without receiving impressions which no subsequent education and experience could efface.

Some passing allusion was made to the manifesta tions of the Spanish Madam during the past summer. Jem scouted at them and derided them, as he had done all along. Kitty did not join with him. 'Don't speak so, Jem,' she tried to silence him. ' We do not know everything ; we cannot tell what God may or may not permit.

Kitty shivered sympathetically, and said hurriedly, 'I hope nobody will frighten baby. After all, it is better not to speak of such things or think of them.' ' I don't agree with you,' said Celia in her laziest tones. ' I enjoy hearing all I can of this shade of my ancestress, and I take it quite ill that it should never look near me.'

The favoured person was in no respects daunted by the compbment paid her, while she solemnly declared that she had encountered the appearance of the long-dead lady in the corridor outside the door of the sisters' room. The narrator described minutely the Spanish Madam's dress and bearing according to tra dition and precedent, the lace shrouding the head and face, the long cloak, the time honoured gestures signifying extreme cold \u2014 - for which, as Celia broke the thread of her discourse to remark dispassionately, there was every excuse that either mortal or im mortal could claim in the rawness of a February evening. She had not been fright ened, she had kept all her wits about her, but she could not make up her mind to speak first according to ghostly etiquette. She had an uncomfortable impression that there might be awkward inquiries and comments with regard to recent events in the family, since she had always heard that the Spanish, as a"], [250, "238 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS nation, were full of hauteur and esprit de corps. ' What stuff,' growled Jem ; ' you saw your shadow, or Lucy in the distance, and your imagination did the rest. You, too, Celia ! I always thought that at least you were beyond bogies.' The overthrow of his conviction appeared to disconcert him more than it shook Celia in her volunteered statement. Kitty made no alteration in her habits, but she would hardly let her child out of her sight, whether she dreaded a scare for his tender years, or that his progenitress might wreak on him her vengeance for mesalliances in general. In spite of Kitty's vigilance little Hugh began to lisp of ' b'ack 'ady ' and ' 'panisb Madam ' in a manner suggestive of a private interview on his own account, in the course of which the ghost had waived its pre rogative of waiting to be addressed, and had confided its identity and name to Hughie. He was a bold, fearless child, so was not even abashed by the strange experience. He"], [251, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 239 seemed rather to regard it in the light in which he had taken his Aunt Ceba's shaking him \u2014 as great fun. Lucy sat transfixed at the tales, staring at Ceba as if the starer's eyes would start from her head, vehemently denying the like lihood of the appearance, as matters of fact, yet never entering bare corridor or empty room without scudding across it like a lap wing, starting at the slightest sound, shedding copious floods of tears when she was alone, and hiding her weeping with a scared face if a spectator came on the scene. As if in obliging acknowledgment of the trembling expectation and fearful joy with which the rumour of its return was greeted and further visits looked for by the Beavers, by Zecchy Sampson, and Lovey Veale, and Oxcleeve generally, it came again to all its old haunts \u2014 mostly in the dusk of the winter afternoon, but sometimes in the late dawn or early starlight, and, just as before, if anybody had investigated the coincidence with the"], [252, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 240 care which George Fielding had bestowed on it, it would have been found that there was a remarkable relation between the ' walking ' of the Spanish Madam and the strolling abroad of Mr. Tony North. It was the fresh scandal of the Spanish Madam's restlessness, together with other and more disquieting rumours, which brought George Fielding a second time to Oxcleeve. He came no longer for his pleasure. He had ceased to be influenced by antiquarian, legend-identifying propensities, or by any gentle dabbling in psychology. He was spurred on by vexation of spirit and alarm, and these feelings carried him straight to the Court, into which he had not ventured to set foot since the day when Jem Endicott dragged Delaval Pool, and Lady Jones feasted gentle and simple afterwards.

It might be rash of him, but Kitty said he had been as far as the Pack man's Bridge the day before, and was no worse, rather the better of it.' ' There is nothing wrong with Jem,' he said, scarcely able to realise what a spent woman she was, when her feeble gait was no longer present to his eyes, when her drive had brought the faintest tinge of pink into her sun-bleached, tear-washed cheeks, and her grey eyes shone bright as diamonds under her white hair.

I have no doubt that you agree with me there must be a stop put to these stage tricks.' ' Of course,' she said sharply, her brow contracting ; ' what mad, defiant folly to try them again.' ' Exposure is certain to follow sooner or later,' he said ; ' indeed, if my informant told me rightly, there was a narrow escape from it the day before yesterday, when Will Tre gdleas mustered as much Dutch courage from the drink he happened to have taken, to seize hold of her by the cloak. A gentleman came between who seemed to start up for the purpose. Will was too much muddled by drink and dazed by the blow be got to recognise him, but I take it that it must have been Tony North. There is a pretty com plication ! ' She knit her brows again in pain and perplexity, but said nothing. 'I know there are morbid states of the"], [255, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 243 body and mind which are as unaccountable as they are distressing,' he said hesitating. ' I cannot conceive how a modest, gentle girl like Lucy Endicott can indulge in such vagaries.' ' Lucy !

How could you take such an outrageous idea into your head ? It is not Lucy, it is that unhappy girl Ceba ! ' ' Ceba ! ' he exclaimed, in his turn stopping short ; ' Celia ! who discussed the whole affair with me like a lawyer, and was ready to answer every question put to her, while Lucy sat mute and quaibng. Ceba ! ' he repeated ; 'well, that certainly removes one great con tradiction for I could believe her equal to it, though her motive is inconceivable. But depend upon it, Lucy was in the secret. She was an accomplice, at least ; if not, innocence never looked so bke guilt.' ' Don't say an accompbce,' insisted Lady e2"], [256, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 244 Jones vehemently ; ' a coerced, cowed, un happy accessory against her will, perhaps, but no more. Lucy is an innocent, simple, loving girl ; as easily led or misled as a child would be. Ceba cares for nothing and stops at nothing. She has the unfathomable cunning, when she chooses to exercise it, which is one feature of madness. She has no reverence, no tenderness, no fear. I do not know what harm she may not have done to Lucy, who has been at her mercy all these years. I am morally certain she has been playing Lucy off and making a catspaw of her in more ways than this for months. I would not have selected Kitty as a protector for Lucy, but in the character of Jem's wife she can afford her some protection, and one can trust her ; oh ! that is such a comfort.' She stopped in evident grief. He had no choice except to try her further. They were rounding the last goose-green ; Blackhall gate would be in sight the next moment. 'There is something else I wish to tell"], [257, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 245 you, Lady Jones,' he said slowly ; ' you are kind to the people about ; you know most of the poor among them ; you are acquainted with Zecchy Sampson's younger brother who is bedridden and blind ; you drove past his house one day last week, and called out as you did so to a boy who was flogging a donkey unmercifully. Joe Sampson sent his granddaughter to the window to see which of the Endicotts was outside. She told him there was only Lady Jones driving by with some company she had at the Court. He grew angry, and swore he would know an Endicott's voice speaking in that tone among a thousand. When the girl's mother came in the dispute was referred to her, and she said it was mighty queer she had never noticed it before, but now that the notion was put into her head she could see Lady Jones's eyes were the marrow of the old Endicotts' eyes. She was at the Ashford market, where she talked freely of what Joe had said, and what she had thought. An idle young fellow, who"], [258, "246 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS carries about all the gossip of the town, came to me with this mare's nest ; he asked me \u2014 of aLl people \u2014 whether some of the late Hugh Endicott's family had not run away or dis appeared more than a dozen years ago, and whether it was not possible that they might turn up unexpectedly.' She had pulled her ponies up, and her hands on the reins were jerking them so uncertainly that he put his own hand upon hers to guard against an accident. Then she looked straight in his face and said with a full voice, ' George ! ' and he replied with as full a heart in his voice, ' Joanna ! ' There was an instant's pause while they stood and sat arrested there ; then she gently shook off his hand, and flicked her ponies that they might go on. ' You did not know me when I came back,' she said, with the pale ghost of a smile ; 'I thought it was all right then. I had feared the encounter with you more than with Jem or any one. You may remember I faced you first to see if my"], [259, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 247 scheme were practicable. I thought that, even if you knew me, you would not betray me.' ' I did not know you in the least,' he admitted. ' You must have gone through a great deal,' he added in a lower tone. 'A great deal,' she echoed, breathing hard. ' The first time I recognised you,' he volunteered the information, ' was the day I met you at Blackhall, when you would be at the bottom of this very story of the Spanish Madam, your ancestress as well as Celia's and Lucy's, though you had not heard of her in the old days.' ' Ah ! did you find me out then ? ' she exclaimed, as if she were half vexed, half amused. ' But you kept my secret, and you helped me to do what I wanted, though I could see that you did not half approve ; while I had no suspicion of all the reasons which you had for your disapproval.' ' Yes,' he said ruefully, ' and it is not the"], [260, "248 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS first time you have made me help you in what I did not approve of. If it had not been for me, if I had not sold those colts for you and brought you the money \u2014 while I bttle guessed the use you were going to put it to \u2014 you could never have quitted Blackhall.' A spasm of pain passed over her face. ' Do not speak of it,' she said ; ' I cannot tell yet whether I was inspired for her deliver ance or possessed with a devil, as I am sure more than one of the Endicotts have been.' ' But it must be spoken of,' he said firmly ; ' it has come to that, for otherwise it will all come out in spite of you. You are going to tell them, and I am here to stand by you, if you will let me.' 'Old friend!' she said, with a quick emphasis of thanks ; but she drooped in every line of her figure, and in a second looked aged, worn, and feeble ; she who had not reached her fortieth year, and had once been a young Diana in suppleness of bmb and glow of health and vigour. ' To be rejected"], [261, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 249 and spurned by them all ! ' she said with a dry sob of anguish ; ' I who have thought of them so long, and would do anything to serve them.'

There never was such a thing heard of as so great a deception practised to the end where near relations as well as common acquaint ances were concerned ; and when the reve lation is made, the discovery that you have grossly misled them is not likely to wipe out old grievances, and prepossess your family in your favour. No doubt you were fain to load them with benefits, but these were received under a false impression. I can tell you it was the very worst policy to pursue where Jem was concerned. Don't you see it was like cheating him into swallowing a bribe? A man's whole pride and honesty would revolt at such treatment.'"], [262, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 250 He was forcing himself to put the stern truth plainly before her, in order to force her to adopt the only remedy he could see for her error. But he stopped when he saw her shrink as from a blow, and when she told him piteously the woman's foolish delusion, bred of sorrow and longing, in one who was natu rally clear-sighted. She was so much changed in the interval of fifteen years, during which the boy Jem and the children Ceba and Lucy from whom she had parted must have grown up to man hood and womanhood without hearing of her, with hardly a remembrance of her which they would not seek to banish and forget, that she thought she might come back and brave the slight chance of the few older people about Oxcleeve recognising her. She was widowed, independent, rich ; what was to hinder her from living near them, getting to know them as a stranger might know them, to watch over them even as she had abandoned them, to help them from her superfluity, and secure"], [263, "THE SPANISH MADAM AGAIN 251 in return a few crumbs of their regard before she died ? Then she would endow them with what was in her power to bestow of worldly goods, of which it was hard that she should have so much and they so httle ; and when she was gone it would not matter so much if her identity were discovered, for surely they would have charity for her when she lay in her grave. Yet she had been as good as dead to them these fifteen years, and her memory was still a horror. ' Events must take their course,' she said at last, despairingly. ' I am here because you have summoned me to unmask Celia - \u2014 not to declare myself \u2014 not at Blackhall \u2014 not in my father's house, where I last saw him and defied and renounced him,' she said with a shudder. ' I could not do it, George Fielding, you could not ask it of me. I know I am in your power, but for that very reason you will spare me as you have always spared me. I must have time to think, to prepare myself for what may happen.'"], [264, "252 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS He was compelled to acquiesce, though it was against his judgment, almost against his conscience.

There would be enough in evitable exposure without that. He did not know how much reason Joanna had to dread it. She used to be brave, the bravest woman he had ever known. Was it conscience, which makes cowards of us all, that unnerved her now ? Was it the result of a monomania, come of brooding over her father's horrible denunciations and miserable fate ?

Even Celia's half-insolent challenge, ' Why do all our good things come at once ? Our friends ought to have doled out the favour of their company, and not combined to overwhelm us by their united presence,' was an everyday relief. It felt for a moment as if all the trouble which lay behind and be forehand must be the figment of a disordered brain. The Endicotts were not alone, as was commonly the case. They had visitors ; two visitors had come separately already, and these, by an irony of fate, were the vicar and his cousin. They had arrived from opposite quarters, without guessing each other's inten tion, and had met at Blackhall."], [266, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 254 CHAPTER XXXYH. GEORGE FIELDING FAILS TO REVEAL THE SECOND GHOST, BUT TONY NORTH FORCES IT TO APPEAR. Miles North had nursed long enough his offended dignity, his resentment where Kitty was concerned, his sick suspicions and ap prehensions with regard to Lucy. He bad not yet fulfilled his painful mission to Jem, contenting himself with keeping his eye on Tony in the meantime. This watch he had found so arduous a task that he had come to the conclusion there are limits to everything, even to a clergyman and kinsman's endurance of an irreclaimable black sheep. And a clergyman cannot cut himself off from any part of his flock. He cannot indulge in protracted personal quarrels if he be either honest or wise. As a man he may"], [267, "GEORGE FIELDLNG FAILS 255 have his private opinions and feelings ; his hand, like that of the Douglas of old, may be his own; but as a parson he must christen, marry, and bury irrespective of his iikes and dislikes. He must pray and praise and preach, and in order that there may be some hope of success, with God's blessing on his services, he must cultivate at least clerical good relations with his people. Therefore the Rev. Miles called clerically at Blackhall, and sat stiffly on one of Lucy's not too easy chair cushions, his hat in one hand as a signal of his speedy departure, and talked formal commonplaces. His feebngs had not changed. He was conscious that be had not forgiven Kitty, who sat there in the character of his hostess, and was as stiff and formal as he was himself. As for Ceba, she had always been ob jectionable to him. He was a little more in charity with Jem, because Miles North knew in his heart of hearts that though Jem had done wrong and been a fool, he might have"], [268, "256 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS done a vast deal worse and been something else than a fool. In addition his lot had been hard, and he still looked ill. Miles kept wondering, before Lady Jones made her appearance, if she or any one else took the trouble to remark how thin Lucy Endicott was getting, and how her pretty colour went and came. He would have wondered in a stib bvelier and more irate fashion what Tony was seeking there, but his cousin's debut followed that of Miles, and when the gentle man sauntered in the awkwardness and pain which the scene involved to the vicar was in tensified enormously by the gleam of sardonic malice in his relative's small twinkbng eyes. At last George Fielding and Lady Jones were added to the party, and, as Ceba said, there was quite a gathering. They were sufficient for the vicar to speak a word in season to them if he thought fit. ' Do,' said Tony, addressing the clergyman with bland patronage, ' now that you have been so fortunate as to catch your birds,' he"], [269, "GEORGE FIELDING FAILS 257 finished, in unblushing allusion to his own notorious practice of absenting himself from church. Miles frowned. George Fielding came to his aid, and also suppbed the keynote to Lady Jones. George had come to the conclusion that it was well Ceba's fellow-offender was there, and perhaps it was not ill that the vicar was likewise in the company. 'What is this I hear, Endicott, of your troublesome ancestress again dis turbing the tranquillity of the village ? ' ' Oh, bosh ! ' cried Jem angrily. ' I think the whole world is gone mad about that idiotic story. What should she disturb any body for ? She was well enough off in her day, I understand. I wish other people had fared as well.' Lady Jones was ready to interpose, but Tony North was before her, suggesting ob bgingly that his cousin ought to lay the ghost. Tony believed the most approved plan was to read a chapter of the Bible, and VOL. III. S"], [270, "258 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS call on the spirit to appear and say what it wanted. ' That might not be so easy,' said Celia pleasantly, ' if spirits are like human beings.'

'They wear nineteenth century lace, woven at Nottingham and bought from Bliss in Ashford. I have seen lace in his shop the same as a bit I picked up when I was in the lumber-room here which the ghost is said to haunt, and where, no doubt, it left a small portion of its head-gear behind it unnoticed. I have also had a minute description of its Andalusian mantle, and I have reason to think it is simply a fur cloak with the black silk lining turned outwards.' There was a stifled shriek from Lucy, who hid her face in her hands, and looks of surprise and bewilderment from Jem and the vicar. Kitty started and glanced keenly from one sister to the other. Ceba and Tony did"], [271, "GEORGE FIELDING FAILS 259 not look at each other. Perhaps if they had his covert signal would have been, 'Im possible to prove. The best policy is to profess utter ignorance of her meaning.' But Celia loved a scene ; strife was indeed the breath of her nostrils. She bad a curious diseased passion for distinction of any kind, and she was getting tired of the poor little game, which it was evident was played out. She gave one of her rather boisterous laughs. ' So I am detected ! But it has been a piece of good fun where bttle fun was going.

She put up her trembling hands, not knowing what she did, and pushed back her white hair till it lay in ruffled flakes. She looked round with a wild, appealing glance. ' Jem,' she gasped. He came to her side instantly. ' What do you wish, Lady Jones ? ' he asked in his blunt puzzled way.

' ' Hush, hush, Jem ; wait and hear what she has to say,' cried Kitty, putting her hand on his arm. George Fielding and Lady Jones were staggered by the further revelation, which they had not provoked, though the disclosure itself was not wholly unexpected. The vicar's head remained so bent that, sitting as he was in the shadow, nobody could see his face. Was it because he did not know whether to go or stay ? Was he wishing the Endicotts would not wash their dirty linen in his presence ? Lucy in her anguish was beyond caring ;"], [277, "GEORGE FIELDING FAILS 265 she was shamed before all the world, and it must be before him too. ' Oh, Jem !

She said I must have the things, and it would be easy enough to tell you afterwards. She would not suffer me to speak to Lady Jones ; she advised me to let Mr. Tony North lend me the money. She laughed at me, they both laughed at me, for minding. But I knew after I had done it that it was something wicked. I have never had a happy moment since I could not tell you. I have had thoughts of telling Kitty, but I knew she would never have run into debt. Oh ! I wished when you were ill that I could have died instead of you. I wish \u2014 I wish it now.'

Miles North raised his bent head and gave a look at his cousin, as if, man of peace and of a sacred vocation though the vicar was, he could have slain Tony where he sat. It was that gentleman with his satyr face who at last deigned to defend himself, or rather, like Celia, to turn the accusation on another.

' A most singular chain of coincidences to lead to nothing, wouldn't you say ? ' demanded Tony insinuatingly, with his head on one side, his eyes looking at no body and nothing in particular. Long before he had finished, two of the company knew well what was coming.

Then it seemed as if all the others present fell into the background and sank into in significance, while the interview was between her and Jem alone, and they two would have forgotten the presence of the whole world had it been there to see. She had dragged herself to his side ; she did not presume to touch him, even by falbng at his feet and clinging to them. She stood erect, though shaking in every limb, a solitary figure in her widow's dress, her hands falling at her sides, waiting to receive her sentence.

Lady Jones,' she added, in her quaint, schoolmistress way, ' I know you will not disdain my adherence when I say that, though we are not sisters in blood, I am proud to think that the law holds us as sisters, and that my little Hugh is entitled to call you aunt.' Miles North rose from where he had sat, a strongly interested listener. There was a sort of pale infallibility about him which stood him in good stead as an arbiter. ' Endicott,' he said, ' I do not apologise for speaking to you after what I have seen and heard. Besides, I am your clergyman and friend as well as hers. Your wife is right,' and by the tone in which he said it Kitty knew that her delinquencies were forgiven.

In the name of Christian manliness and natural affection, I call on you to be reconciled to your sister.' Jem's sole reply was to free his arm and walk away. But those who knew and under stood him best viewed his action as a conces sion in the right direction. It was not till some minutes had passed that he justified their anticipations by saying in rough, re proachful accents to Joanna : ' Why did you go and leave us, Jack ? So long as we had you we had somebody to depend upon ; but you took yourself off and left us in the lurch.' Who had called her Jack last, and when was it ? She dared not stop to ask herself. ' It was to save her,' she repeated wistfuby. ' Ob ! are you not glad, after aU, that she was saved, and found a place in which she could be sorry, and die in peace ?

That night Lucy went to the Court with Joanna, and the sisters slept in each other's arms.

It would have been only a relief had her sisters and brother been more like her and less bke themselves. As it was, they could not emulate her unscrupulous self seeking and heartless indifference apart from her malignity. Her withdrawal was also a source of secret anxiety and hidden sorrow. It was a cause of pensive regret to Lucy, who had been brought up with Celia, and, badly as Celia had treated her, could not altogether tear the old image, though its sway was broken, from her heart. Even Kitty, who had not a drop of blood in common with Celia, on whom she would have trampled if Kitty had let her, could not help wondering, especially when things were going well at Blackhall, how Celia was faring and what would become of her. Greg Barnes came once more to the Court to grasp Lady Jones's hand ; but he did more"], [298, "286 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS than grasp her hand, he gave her a sounding kiss on her white cheek.

She filled every available glass and jug with flowers in their season. She worked por tieres and mantelpiece borders with the most sumptuous materials. She embroidered dainty frocks for bttle Hugh. She remembered with an inappropriate offering everybody's birthday, including Kitty's, and none, not even Lady Jones herself, treasured the tribute as Kitty treasured it. She caused Jem to appreciate his advantages, and to wear cardinals' slippers and Turks' caps, which there was no longer imminent danger of the bailiffs seizing."], [301, "'WHAT WILL MRS.

Lucy, under the care of her sister, Lady Jones, protected by her from every hurt that mortal could ward off, invested by her with every advantage which wise, tender com panionship, peaceful, plentiful surroundings, and the resources of an ample fortune could command, was a very different Lucy from one of the slighted, reckless Endicott girls, cling ing to a precarious footing at Blackhall. The Rev. Miles was not more time-serving than his fellows ; but he had a constitutional, well-nigh womanish, regard for appearances, even while he had, as he had confessed, received a lesson to judge not by appearances, but to judge righteous judgment. He was also constitutionally prudent and foreseeing. Lucy, handsomely portioned by her sister, was not the penniless bride who would bring further pinching and scrambling for ways and means on a poor and proud clergyman. The Rev.

She went with him to the sheltered, sunshiny vicarage in the Cleeve, to wait upon him and worship him as the noblest, most heart-satisfying work God and the world could have given her. Lady Jones saw her go with a mother's unselfish smiles, prayers, and blessings, as sure, as a creature can be of any earthly boon, that Lucy's happiness and honour were safe in a good man's keeping. Lady Jones turned back with her tottering"], [303, "'WHAT WILL MRS. REYNOLDS SAY?' 291 feet and her white hair into the little grey old Court, but yet she was not desolate. The burden had been removed from her shoulders also. Her father's curse seemed lifted off. She could go abroad without fear of detec tion. Old people hailed her, and spoke to her of the Endicotts before the days of their sins and sorrows. Both Lucy and Jem were near her. Lucy looked in upon her sister on most days, and claimed her sympathy and help in going about the vicar's errands in the parish. No doubt Lucy was efficiently aided in her official capacity, as her husband had been before her, by Mrs. Reynolds. That lady, following the example of the immortal Miss Bingley to Elizabeth Bennet, had paid off all the arrears of civility due to Miss Lucy Endicott ; and Lucy North received the atonement and accepted the aid with a simple, good faith, which made her husband and sister smile the one moment, and brought the moisture into u 2"], [304, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 292 their eyes the next. The vicar himself came to the mistress of the Court, as he had done from the beginning of their acquaintance, for rest and refreshment from his cares and worries, talked affectionately of Lucy, and treated Lady Jones as the friend he had called her. Lady Jones was constantly to be seen driving all over the Blackhall property and the moor with Jem Endicott walking at her ponies' heads, clearing paths for them, leading them through the brooks and over the stones, while he sought the counsel she was so fit to give, or talked gruffly in a lowered voice of old times. Kitty \u2014 wise little woman, with a dignity of her own \u2014 was never in the least jealous of the intimate association of these two. She was fond of Lucy, but she re verenced Joanna next to the vicar. Kitty made a good wife to Jem.

She was quite enough of a lady for the poor homely squire of Blackhall, who in spite of all Lady Jones could do for him was neither rich nor distinguished ; and true ladies and gentlemen, like Greg Barnes with his wife and daughters, never hesitated about giving Kitty, no less than her husband, the right hand of fellowship. When it came vividly home to Lady Jones, as it could not fail to do sometimes, that she was a widow, childless and infirm in her prime, one solace \u2014 the chief of all \u2014 con soled her.

George Fielding no longer avoided the Court ; he came and sat there, as the vicar sat, for rest and conversational delight, for in telbgent sympathy with his pursuits, a know ledge equal to his own of the early histories and attributes of all the natives of the district far and near, and as keen an interest in their welfare, together with much thoughtful, well digested information on places, persons, and modes of life which she had been acquainted with at first hand, but he was only familiar with by books or hearsay. Lady Jones did not often speak of herself in these conversations, there were so many more interesting topics to discuss, and she still more rarely complained. But something in the talk one bright June day, when lights and shadows were scudding across the moor, caused her to tell him how she had felt when she had come back to Oxcleeve unable to walk a couple of hundred yards unaided,"], [307, "'WHAT WILL MRS. REYNOLDS SAY?' 295 though it had been to save her bfe. ' It felt so strange, George, to see it all the same \u2014 the sky, the horizon line, the tors, the furze, the heather, the cattle, the sheep and the geese, and I so unfit to cope with them. I could hardly believe it. I would start up and feel as if I must be able to walk and the incapacity was aU a delusion. And I would walk wonderfully well for three minutes. Do you know I got out of the bttle carriage by myself once, and actually stumbled for that length of time up to the Lady's Gown water fall on Black Tor? I had to try it to convince myself that I could not do it.' ' But you will walk again some day, when you get stronger,' be said, not looking at her, unable to meet her bright wistful eyes with the mixture of pathos and humour in their expression, and to recall how her agile feet were wont to skim, bke the low flight of a bird, over height and hollow. Why, she had once challenged him to be at the top of Red Cap before her, and had won the challenge."], [308, "296 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS ' No, never,' she said, shaking her head emphatically ; ' the case is desperate, hopeless. The most eminent men in the faculty of medi cine have sat on the case and pronounced that there was no possibility of recovering this lost power. Indeed, they think that it is quite wonderful and very creditable to my constitu tion, and say that I should be glad and grateful, as I mostly am, that I have retained so much command of the nerves of motion as I still possess to move about my bouse and get in and out of my phaeton. I am sensible in my own body that a faculty is gone from me which I once had in perfection, I will say that, George. I was a good walker, if I could not do much else. Something has left me, and there is no help for it save to make the best of the deprivation and thank God for what remains. I might have been bbnd, or deaf, or tortured by pain, or prostrated by sickness. Now I have not even to wait and watch for returning health and strength, as you suggested ; I am well and strong, sitting"], [309, "'WHAT WILL MRS. REYNOLDS SAY?' 297 here. Few people can do more than I can in a way, if I could only be content with my own window-seat and fireside, as a widow by no means young ought to be. It would be a dis grace to me to murmur ; I am not murmuring, ami?' 'No,' he said, 'only you are not forty; you are five years younger than I am, and I don't consider myself old,' he reminded her in a tone that hovered between reproach and decision ; then he added impetuously, ' my hearth is lonely, too. You know I once wished you to share it ; can it not be so yet \u25a0now ? ' ' I ! ' she protested almost indignantly, ' a broken-down, infirm woman, while you are still young, full of life and vigour, not far past your prime. You may get a blooming girl to share your lot and make your home bright.' ' I don't want a blooming girl,' he said, scouting the idea. ' I would rather have you, broken down and infirm as you call yourself, if you could only sit in the chimney-corner\u2014"], [310, "298 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS and you know you can do a great deal more than that \u2014 than all the blooming girls in the kingdom.' A faint colour came into her pale cheek. ' That is like the old George,' she said, putting over his hand another hand, which he took and held fast, ' that is because you are sorry for me, and would fain do what you can to make up for what I have suffered, though I made you suffer too, in your day.' 'It is not,' he contradicted her flatly, while he got up and walked up and down the room, and then came back and stood looking down on her. ' I did care for you ; I don't know that you were ever fully aware bow much I cared. Well, I won't say that you have never been out of my head since those days, or that I have never had a happy hour since I lost you, because I hold that there is happiness of all kinds, just as there is work of all kinds, in the world, if we will only take it and make the best of it. But I will say that I never cared or can care for another woman as I"], [311, "'WHAT WILL MRS. REYNOLDS SAY?' 299 have cared for Joanna Endicott ; and that to this day to have her for my wife, to get her, as she is, to share my life, would be to double, ay, to multiply a hundredfold, every satisfac tion and pleasure \u2014 and I grant they are many -which are left to me.' ' No, no,' she said sadly, ' it is impossible. If there was an insurmountable barrier between us when we were young, if I would not carry the miserable experience and worse than tarnished reputation of an unhappy household, established under an honest man's roof, in another home where the occupants dwelt without fear and without reproach, you may be sure I am still less likely to do so now, when my own name has been dragged through the mire, when my own father ' ' Hush ! ' he said, quelling her rising agita tion, 'you must not distress yourself on my account. But you are the old woman still, Joanna,' he suddenly turned upon her with lurking bitterness, ' you are as ready as ever to throw me over for a scruple, to sacrifice"], [312, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 300 me and yourself to the demands of your pride and to the opinion of others \u2014 not to the opinion of anybody whose word is worth heeding, but to the verdict of idle, malicious gossips and base slanderers. When should I have paid any attention to such spiteful chatter where you were concerned ? What should I care if you come to me innocent, though the whole world held you guilty ? Surely we are old enough to be independent of such impertinent interference in our affairs.' She was older and wiser, and she was shaken in her conviction, though she still resisted. ' But George ' she began more timidly. ' I will have no buts,' he insisted, drawing her towards him. ' Come and make me happy, Joanna \u2014 you know you could always do that when you liked \u2014 and I ask nothing better in return than to be let take care of you, if I cannot make you happy.' ' I don't know that anybody ever thought much of doing that,' she said sadly, with one"], [313, "'WHAT WILL MRS. REYNOLDS SAY?' 301 of her frank, almost girlish impulses, 'except one kind old man who took me on trust,' and she looked up gratefully at the portrait of the late Sir Benjamin, in his superfine broad-cloths hanging over the chimney-piece. ' God bless him for it. I owe his memory an eternal debt of gratitude,' said George Fielding fervently ; ' but let us try if I cannot make you happy ; you have never tried me, and I think I could.' ' It was not that I was afraid of,' she sighed, but the sigh died out on his loyal breast. A silence fell between the couple. Out side, beyond the flagged pathway and the arching ash trees over the garden gate, the geese stretched their necks and cackled and hissed over their version of the last event in the Endicott family history. ' What will Mrs. Reynolds say, George ? ' the woman broke the silence, with a glance of comical apprehension. ' She will say that one good turn deserves"], [314, "302 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS another, since it was she who brought me to the Three Foxes, where I met you again,' answered the man audaciously ; ' she will not be astonished at anything which may happen when a bachelor and a widow are brought into dangerous proximity.' ' Oh ! the vanity of man,' said Lady Jones. THE END. FRISTED BY SPOTTISW00DE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE LONDON"], [315, ""], [316, ""], [317, "[October, 1888.
