Touching God Himself, hath he anywhere revealed, that it is his delight to dwell beggarly ? and that He taketh no pleasure to be worshipped, saving only in poor cottages ? Even then was the Lord as acceptably honoured of His people as ever, when the stateliest places and things in the world were sought out to adorn His Temple The Prophet David doth mention a natural con- veniency which such kind of bounteous expenses have, as well for that we do thereby give unto God a testimony of our cheerful affection, which thinketh nothing too dear to be bestowed about the furniture of His service, as also because it serveth to the world for a witness of His almightiness, whom we outwardly honour with the chiefest of outward things, as being of all things Himself incomparably the greatest. Besides, were it not also strange if God should have made such store of glorious creatures on earth, and leave them all to be consumed in secular vanity, allowing none but the baser sort to be imployed in His own service.

This, I presume, refers to Act III of the XXII Parliament of King James the Sixth, held at Edinburgh, the 28th of June, 1 6 1 7, \" .\\nent the plantation of Kirks.\" The preamble of this Act, as being most apposite to the subject of this note, deserves transcribing : \u2014 \" Our Soveraine Lord, considering, that there be divers Kirks within this kingdome, not planted with ministers, wherethrough ignorance and atheisme, abounds amongst the people ; and that monie of those that are planted, have no sufficient provision or maintenance, appointed to them, whereby the ministrie are keeped in povertie and contempt, and cannot fruitfullie travell in their charges,\" i. e. cannot discharge their duties usefully and profitably to their flock ; * This very able and spirited member of the House of Commons, in his speech on the state of religion and Church livings, on the 10th of February, 1626, stated, that there were nearly 9,000 benefices or livings, two-thirds of which were under \u00a330. a year; 4,000 under .\u00a320., and 2,000 under ,\u00a310. ; and very justly remarked, that residence could not be expected on a single benefice that did not afford a subsistence. His speech of 1628 was published on a single sheet at the time; republished in the 'Ephemeris Parliamentaria' in 1654, and is preserved in Ep. Kennett's work on Impropriations. It abounds in sensible observations and is worth consulting. He told them, that \" to plant good ministers in good living*, was the strongest and surest means of establishing true religion : that it would prevail more against Papistry, than tbe making new laws or exe cuting of old : that it would counterwork court connivance and luke-warm accommodation; that though the calling of ministers be glorious within, yet outward poverty will bring contempt upon them, especially among those who measure men by the acre, and weigh them by the pound.\" The following contains a truth of eternal importance, \" The best way to dispel darkness is to let in light. We say, that day breaks, but no man ever heard the voice of it. God comes in the still voice. Let us quickly mend our candlesticks and we cannot want light.\""], [95, "NOTES, 85 \"considering also, that nothing is more properlie be- longing TO HIS PRINCELIE CAIR THEN TO SEE TO THE GUDE ESTATE OF THE KlRKS WITHIN HIS DOMINIONS, OUT OF THAT ZEALE WHICH His MaJESTIE BEARES TO THE PRO- MOVING of the kingdom of CHRIST, and for ane perfite remedie of those evills,\" &c. &c. &e. It is somewhat strange, that Archbishop Spotiswood should have referred only in general terms to this important Act. See Hist, of the Church of Scotland, ed. 1668, p. 530. King James, however, succeeded better in Ireland and in Scotland, with his plans for improving the con- dition of the Clergy by rendering the livings an actual maintenance, than in England, although he was not wanting in kind intentions and active endeavours. After the failure of the several projects, proposed to the Committee, appointed under the Bill against Pluralities and Non-residence, brought in by Sir Edward Montagu in February, 16 10, the same grievance was laid before the King by the two Houses of Parliament in July ; and the representation produced from James the following remarks : \" Although never any Christian king had in greater detestation the covetous and immoderate heaping up of many benefices together, especially where the neglect of the cure is joined therewith ; yet it cannot be expected of our hands, that we should in this, more than in other cases, abridge any of our loving subjects, of that which they have in express words granted them by the laws of our realm. Or, if we might lawfully in this place so do, yet we should not hold it convenient, until some further provision be made, that the bene- fices of this realm might be made competent livings for godly ministers and learned preachers, and that with some difference answerable to their gifts and merits.\" Charles I. soon after his accession, expressed his anxiety for the improvement of the livings and stipends of the Clergy. In his answer to a Petition from the Parliament at Oxford, he observed, that \"for the better pro- pagating of religion, he recommended it to the House of Parlia ment, that care might be taken and provision made, that every parish should allow a competent maintenance for an able minister ; and that the owners of parsonages impropriate should allow to the"], [96, "86 NOTES Vicars, Curates and Ministers in villages and places belonging to their parsonage, sufficient stipend and allowance for preaching ministers.\" The subject of ' Impropriations ' would lead us to the question of their restitution, and therefore requires a book instead of a note. In these days of practical infidelity, of deism, and indifferentism, I fear the work of Sir Henry Spelman ' De non temerandis Ecclesiis ' would not be allowed to be so convincing and efficacious, as it was in the days of the author, and when he himself so nobly set the example. Many, whose consciences and sense of justice could not withstand his forcible appeal to their moral responsibilities in the sight of God, were delighted to make restitution. One gentleman, Sir William Dodington, restored six impropriations : and Lord Campden, out of one of the many impropriations, which he purchased for the benefit of the poorer Clergy, endowed the living of Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire; and out of another, Hampstead, near London. How many endowments might be founded from the restitution of impropri ations by some of our Nobles at the present day ! Stanza xliv. The modern Christian world has never fairly acknowledged its debt to these keepers of sacred and literary records, during what have been called the ' dark ages.' But, after all, we owe them much more, than we, for a long time, seemed inclined to confess. And, who shall calculate the full amount of our obligations to the laborious disquisitions and subtilties of scholastic theology ? that \" abstruse and crabbed divinity,\" as Fuller calls it, \" all whose fruit is thorns.\" For who will now sound its depths only in the twelve volumes folio of Duns, or the seventeen of Aquinas ; to say nothing of others ? But the intellectual impulse, then given by their gigantic toils, came fairly within the estimate of the historian. Dugald Stewart has done them justice : and still more lately, the ' dark ages ' have found numerous champions of competent ability to pay oft* still more of our debt in Dowling, Le Bas, Churton, Gresley, &c. &c."], [97, "87 NOTES CANTO II. Stanza i. In the Act of James I. cited above, the Commissioners were to appoint and assign, at their discretion, a perpetual local stipend to the Ministers, present and to come, of at least \" 500 merks of yeearly rent, or 5 chalders victuall,\" nor were they to exceed \" ten chalders victuall, or ane thousand merks of money.\" The Scottish markpiece of silver was by proclamation, a few days after James's accession, made current here for 13jd. sterling: although the mode of living in Scotland made it go much farther in that country than in this. (Vid. Folkes's Tables, ed. by Soc. of Ant. p. 145.) This would make the minimum stipend \u00a328. 2s. 6d. By an Act of 1810, (50 G.

A sum of \u00a310,000. is set apart every year out of the royal revenue in Scotland, to assist in doing this : and in a cheap country this puts the Clergy in a position of frugal independence. With respect to the ' chalders of victual,' all corn-rents, stipends, &c. payable in grain, termed ' victual,' are settled in Scotland, according to what are called \" the Friars' prices.\" In every county in Scotland, in the month of February, the Sheriff's, with the assistance of a Jury, strike the ' Friars' prices ' of the different sorts of grain for the preceding crop."], [98, "88 NOTES Stanza iv. It is not the good and learned, the truly elevated in mind or character, the real English nobleman or genuine country gentleman, who are generally wanting in the due estimate of the Clergyman, or in the respect and consideration, which that estimate must inspire. Nor, indeed, does this remark apply to the class of English merchants; an honorable and wealthy grade in our community, generally of high feelings and ingenuous education; bound up by birth, interests, connexions and deliberate attachment, with the form of Church and State, under which they and their forefathers have so long prospered. It is for the most part a some what novel and anomalous portion of our population, the growth of what Sismondi calls the chrematislic system of commercial and manufacturing prosperity or adventure : the wealthy and overween ing, but ill-informed, members of our artificial, yet highly refined, social body ; the half-educated and jealous subjects of a polity, which cannot safely gratify their self-importance ; and of institutions, under which they feel an obscuration or inferiority; and which they fain would level, as well because they cannot understand or appreciate them, as from the fond hope of setting up a 'plutocracy' in their stead. If there are others, who, with the advantages of station, fortune, or education, can possibly underrate the Clergy of their own truly Catholic Church, I would venture to recommend to such persons instead of depreciating them, or crippling their usefulness by contemptuous epithets, to use their best efforts, by every practicable and honest means, to raise these unobtrusive but real supports of the power, dignity and stability of their country, to a state of moderate competency and independence. Let them bear in mind the words of Archbishop Whitgift to Queen Elizabeth : \u2014 \" Madam, religion is the foundation and cement of human societies : and when they that serve at God's altar, shall be exposed to poverty, then religion itself will be exposed to scorn, and become contemptible ; as you may already observe it to be, in too many poor vicarages in this nation.\" \u2014 What would the Archbishop have said to many of our modern Curacies ?"], [99, "NOTES, 89 Stanza v. Whatever may be effected by the ' Ecclesiastical Commission,' the end will never justify the means employed. It will be regarded by the dispassionate judgment of posterity, as a concession to the morbid appetite for innovation and the yells of Dissent ; or, which is the same thing, of Radicalism ; a betrayal of the temporal interests and indefeasible rights of the Church of England ; and a dislocating shock to the very foundations of property. It puts an immensity of patronage, it is true, (where no Churchman will object to see it placed,) in the hands of the Bishops : but affords not a sufficient counterpoise to the monopoly of patronage at present existing, in the hands of government, laymen, colleges, corporations, societies, and private individuals. It depauperates, and disrobes the ' beauty of holiness ' in our cathedrals ; while it destroys some of the noblest incentives to professional exertion, by cancelling no inconsiderable portion of the few prizes and rewards existing in the Church for a life of distinguished labour in the work of Scriptural erudition and interpretation, and in the cause and propagation of the Gospel. But amongst its worst features is this : it acknowledges in a great measure the validity of the \"voluntary principle,\" exonerating the State from the eternal obligation of providing for the spiritual wants of the people in that branch of the Catholic Church, under which it was bred and born, and which it has for its own ends, its own welfare and stability and security, \"established\" and made an integral part of its civil polity; and, at the same time, leaving it to the population of the country to supply by private munificence, by subscription, begging and bazaars, the deficiencies of the funds in the 3 per cent, consols raised by the ' Ecclesiastical Commission ' from the suppression, curtailment, or degradation of dignities and vested rights. This is not the way to bring a blessing upon the country ! And the voluntary principle has already an ample and inexhaustible field in the urgent claims of our colonies, dependencies, and domestic distress. But it would be absurd, in a cursory note, to enter upon a subject, so unanswerably discussed by Messrs."], [100, "90 NOTES, Knight and Hope, and (if we mistake not) by Sewell, in that most masterly of masterly articles in the Quarterly Review, on ' Cathedral Establishments' : to say nothing of the declared opinions in their Charges of several of our ablest Bishops. I would, however, even at the expense of being tedious, advert in this place to the public duty, which ought somewhere to be felt, of applying patronage to the maintenance, however humble, of Clergymen who have laboured all their lives conscientiously, unremittingly, and effectively, in the cause of religion, education, and the best interests of their country. It is no excuse for the pretermission of such men, that there are the claims, as they are called, of multi tudinous chaplains, poor relations and connexions, the sons of friends and agents and constituents, the fellows, expectants, and dependents of colleges and corporations, &c. &c. &c. These may be provided for; the others should. \u2014 The one is a public duty, the other a matter of private feeling, interest, gratitude, or even conventional compensation. \u2014 I know not what others may think upon the subject : to me it is at once painful and mortifying to hear such a man as Dr. G. Gregory, in his old age, warding off the stigma, which some might be inclined to fasten on his grey head for extra-professional pursuits, in terms like these : \"To some persons, who, I must observe, have perhaps more zeal than know ledge, studies such as these, may appear rather inconsistent with the clerical profession, and the science of theology, a science extensive enough, I confess, to occupy the life of one man. I might reply by a simple fact : \u2014 that / never yel have been enabled to gain by the exercise of my profession a livelihood for myself and family, and it must appear a hard case to confine the whole attention of any man to what will not furnish him with the necessaries of life. Yet the great bulk of my previous publications (without excepting my Essays) have been in the direct line of my profession. I do not, however, rest my apology on this argument : but I must say, that in publishing the present work, I believe I am not less essentially serving the cause of religion, than if I had been employed in compiling a treatise of Divinity,\" &c. &c. \u2014 Preface to the 1st edition of the Economy of Nature."], [101, "NOTES, 91 Stanza vi. How little are the higher qualifications of the Clerical character understood ! How inadequately estimated ! They are admirably stated by the incomparable Bishop Taylor. \" They who know,\" says he, \" to give a just value to the best things, know that the sacred office of a priest, a minister of religion, does not only require great holiness, that they may acceptably offer the Christian sacri fices and oblations of prayer and Eucharist for the people, and become their fairest examples; but also great abilities and wise notices of things and persons, strict observation, deep remem brances, prudent applications, courage and caution, severity and mercy, diligence and wisdom, that they may dispense the excellent things of Christianity, to the same effect whither they were designed in the counsels of eternity, that is, to the glory of God and the benefit of souls.\" (Unum necessarium.

The remarks of some of our early writers and preachers on the then lately-introduced doctrines of Calvin, convey to us the senti ments of horror, with which they contemplated his tenets of 'personal election and reprobation:' for their common sense told them, that it is utterly impossible to hold the one doctrine, inde pendently of the other. Archbishop Harsnett, in his Sermon on 'Predestination,' preached at Paul's Cross in 1584 and printed in London in 1656, inveighs with great severity against the newly imported schism. \"There is a conceit in the world, beloved, speakes little better of our gracious God, than this ; and that is, that God should designe many thousands of soules to hell, before they were : \u2014 not in eye to their faults, but to his own absolute will and power; and to get him glory in their damnation. This opinion is growne huge and monstrous (like a Goliath) : men doe shake and tremble at it, yet never a man reacheth to David's sling to cast it down. In the name of the Lord of Hosts, we will encounter it : for it hath reviled, not the host of the living God, but the Lord of Hosts.\""], [102, "92 NOTES Stanza xv. Of the frightful malignity, which characterized the Puritans and other professors of Calvinism, and of the mischievous activity of this poison in a state. South speaks out with his usual force of language : \u2014 \"We have heard much of the 'power of godliness,'\" says he, \" by which is meant only ' the godly party being in power ;' and the ' godly party' with them are those, who have sworn the destruction of monarchy and of the Church, and have bewitched the people with a fardle of strange, canting, insignificant, names. And let men know, that notwithstanding the disguise of a whining expression and a demure face, there is no sort of men breathing, who taste blood with so good a relish : and who having the power of the sword to second their power of yodliness, would wade deeper in slaughter of their brethren, and with the most savage implacable violence, tumble all into confusion, ruin and desolation.\" \u2014 Sermon iv. vol. vii. pp. 81, 82. In the biography of South, in ' Rees' Cyclop\u00e6dia,' it is said, that \" he was a violent enemy to toleration, and to any concessions for conciliating the Separatists :\" \u2014 meaning, no doubt, that because he would make no such \" concessions,\" he was therefore \" a violent enemy to toleration ;\" as if the two things were in the same category. Alas ! he had witnessed the only fruits of such \" concessions for conciliating separatists !\" The Calvinist talks of the 'awful and sublime views,' which his theory gives of the divine perfections and dispensations. God's distinguishing mercy to a chosen few is among these views. This may be 'awful;' and most tremendously awful it certainly must be, to those who can voluntarily plunge into such abysses of darkness and despair. But how dismally does the system, which affords such views, distort the whole glorious scheme of love and \"adoption, whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father,'\" to Him, who is no respecter of persons, who says, \" the flock of my pasture are men ;\" and who appears to address these very religionists in those un distinguishing terms : \" As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his ways and live. Turn ye ! turn ye ! from your evil ways ! for"], [103, "93 NOTES. why will ye die ?\" To those, who know the social and political bearings of Calvinism, the prevalence of this gloomy, uncharitable, disjunctive, republican, antisacramental system of faith is truly alarming. It symbolizes readily with Dissent and Fanaticism; and is unfortunately almost as rife amongst ourselves, as it is predominant in Ireland. It has now insinuated itself into the hitherto orthodox pale and press of the 'Society for promoting Christian Knowledge;' it has assailed the pure pages of Bishop Wilson ; and brought in, contrary, I had thought, to its rules, the Sermon of Bishop Bradford upon this subject. Instead of the unregenerating Baptism of this latter, I could wish to see upon the list of that Society half a dozen such works as ' Short's Five Sermons,' 'Tucker's Six Sermons,' and 'Waterland's Summary View of the doctrine of Justification,' with an abridgment of Bishop Bethell on Regeneration. But I shall conclude this note, with the well-known quotation from Jortin. \" In England at the time of the Synod of Dort we also were much divided in our opinions concerning the controverted articles : but our Divines, having taken the liberty to think and judge for themselves ; and the civil government not interposing, it hath come to pass, that from that time to this, almost all persons here of any note for learning and abilities, have bid adieu to Calvinism, have sided with the Remonstrants, and have left the Fatalists to follow their own opinions and rejoice (since they can rejoice) in a religious system consisting of human creatures without liberty, doctrines without sense, faith without reason, and a God without mercy.\" \u2014 Dissert.

For I suppose few men will pretend to pray by inspiration : and though extemporary prayer may more heat the fancy, there may be more serious devotion and piety in using a form, where we have nothing to do but to offer up our souls to God, without setting our inventions upon the rack, what to say. An extemporary prayer"], [104, "94 NOTES, is as much a form, and does as much confine and stint the spirit in all but the speaker, as a book-prayer does ; and that is a very sorry devotion at best, which owes its heats and passions not to an inward sense of God, but to a musical voice, earnestness in the speaker, surprising invention, or popular rhetoric.\" \u2014 Bean Sherlock on Religious Assemblies, pt. II. c. 3. With respect to the assistance of the Spirit in extemporary prayer and the true value of our Liturgy, it would be well if the admirable Sermon of Archbishop Sharp on the text from which the expression of \"praying by the Spirit\" has been taken, (viz. 1 Cor. xiv. 15.) were printed separately and circulated widely. It will be found in the 4th vol. of the London edition of 1749, Sermon v. p. 101. Stanza xx. One striking cause of the degradation of the Church and of the exaltation of the Conventicle, has been the exaggerated and mischievous importance attached to the ' Sermon,' as a part of public worship. With the former, it is a mere appendage, with the latter the paramount concern. The glorious, and, as it were, embodied worship of the collected members of Christ's body in one united voice and spirit, of penitence, and prayer and praise, and adoration and thanksgiving, in the congregation ; their edification and cordial concurrence in the holy ordinances and ministrations of the Church ; and their justification and spiritual fellowship with Christ himself in the solemnity of the life-giving Eucharist, are all postponed to the effusions and admonitions of man's teaching and preaching, to the eloquence, the bodily and mental powers, of a sinner like themselves, although duly invested with the office of spiritual instructor. No wonder, therefore, that itching ears have been more common than hungry souls ! No wonder, that so few have felt the difference between ' the beauty of holiness' in our Zion, and its feast of fat things for the famishing ; and the leanness, the poor and beggarly elements of man's unauthorized discussion and declamation in the licensed Meeting-house. No wonder, that ignorant and unstable hearers have left the Church, because"], [105, "NOTES, 95 the preacher is not all, that they, in their excitable hearts and uninformed minds, had set up as the standard of 'gospel eloquence' and ' spiritual preaching. ' And lastly, no wonder, in many instances, that they find the transition so easy from the Clergyman who magnifies his own powers and importance, his perhaps turgid oratory or his injudicious zeal in the work of conversion, as it is improperly called, at the expense of the other parts of our deeply impressive and far more effectual worship, to the enthusiastic and self-constituted preacher of every shape and shade of latitudina rianism, of \" all false doctrine, heresy and schism.\" Upon ' popular preaching,' and the proper estimate to be formed of this ingredient of human instruction and admonition in the service of our Church, it may not be amiss to transcribe the sensible remarks of Dean Sherlock: \"There is much unaccountable fancy and humour to be seen in those different judgments men make of preachers, that it were a very hard case, if the peace, order, and government of the Church were to lie at the mercy of men's different fancies. Some are taken with a grave and solid, others with a florid and polite preacher. Some are pleased with a tone, others with earnestness and vehemence of action and voice. How often do many men vary in their opinions of preachers ! and change their churches as their fancy changes ! Those preachers, who are dis liked by their own parishioners, are very often admired by strangers. Now, what work would this make in all civil governments, were fancy suffered to overrule public establishments ! And we have as little reason to expect that God will allow of such inroads of fancy upon the order and government of the Church. The design of Church communion and of preaching the gospel is not to please and tickle a wanton fancy, but to instruct us in the plain duties of the gospel : and to furnish us with the arguments and motives of a holy life. And, (thanks be to God !) such discourses we may meet with in most Churches of this nation, though it may not be always dressed to every man's palate.\" \u2014 On Religious Assemblies, Pt.

In the curious Life of Skelton, reprinted with the Lives of Newton, Pearce and Pocock, there is recorded a singular instance of charity, on two occasions, by this amiable man. The Rev. Philip Skelton, of Pettigo, who distinguished himself by several professional publications, and a thousand acts of beneficence, after expending all his money in the service of his poorer neigh bours, determined during a dearth in Ireland in 1757, to sell his books for the relief of his parishioners. He accordingly negotiated with Mr. Watson the bookseller in Dublin, and received from him \u00a380. for them, which sum he instantly applied and with great judgment to the necessities of his flock. The sacrifice in this instance was the greater, as his lot was cast in a rude and barbarous neighbourhood, where a library was a luxury unknown, and he himself was a scholar whose whole leisure was spent among his books. He sold them again on a similar occasion to Dr. Wood ward, Dean of Clogher, in 1778. They were 700 volumes in number and he received \u00a3100. for them. Stanza xliv.

The Chair was taken by NICHOLAS CHARRINGTON, ESQ.: and in the course of the proceedings, amongst other interesting facts connected with the ministry of Mr. James, it was stated that he had held the situation of sole Curate of the parish for a period of nearly twenty eight years ; that during this time the greater part of the duty of one of the most populous districts of the metropolis had devolved upon him ; that for twelve years consecutively he had attended at the Parish Church not only every Sunday, but every day, without a single exception either from sickness or any other cause ; that while his Sabbath labours were at all times unusually heavy, it was no uncommon circumstance for him to go through such a succes sion of duties as the following \u2014 first to marry twenty couple with all the attendant labour of registering them ; then to take the entire Morning Service and Sermon; then to bury one, two, or more corpses ; then to go, with no breathing time allowed him, to perform the Church Service again ; and again to preach in a small Chapel attached to some almshouses in the neighbourhood, of which he was Chaplain, and for which he received a small stipend; this duty over, he had to hasten back to the Parish Church for Evening Service, which he had to read, and afterwards to preach for the third time, without any assistance; his labours not yet ended, after the Evening Service he had frequently from twenty to thirty children to baptize and register ; and, after all, again to read the Funeral Service for the dead. Such is a specimen of the kind of labour, or rather we should call it drudgery, which, with but little assistance, for twenty-eight years Mr. James had to discharge, and which at last wore out and brought him prematurely to the grave. He has left a family of three orphan children, two daughters and a son, we deeply regret to say, with little or no provision, which indeed, as is the case with so many of our hard worked and ill-requited Curates, he had it not in his power to make.

It is hoped that a case like this will excite the sympathy of friends of the Church beyond the bounds of the parish of Stepney.

King's College Chapel, Cambridge, contains a noble collection of stained glass. It is richly embellished with twenty-three windows having six scriptural subjects in each, well-executed and magnificently coloured. They are considered the finest series of painted win dows in England. The windows in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, were painted by Jarvis and Forest from designs by West, and are well known. The Church of Fairford in Gloucestershire is justly celebrated for its splendid treasures in stained glass. Dallaway gives the following account of it. \"About the year 1492 John Tame, a wealthy merchant of London, took a Spanish vessel, bound from a Flemish port for Italy, laden with the glass : and according to the expensive piety of those days, founded a Church of very regular Gothic, for its reception. There are twenty-five of these highly-embellished windows, the best of which is the third in the north aisle. The subject is the Salutation of the Virgin : in which is a fine architectural perspective of the Temple. The great windows both east and west retain their original perfection. Of the first mentioned, the subject is Christ's Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem; in which the effect of the crimson velvet and gilding is truly surprising. The story of the other is ' the Last Judgment.' Gothic fancy has been indulged to the extreme in these designs, which are at once horrible and ludicrous. So brilliant are the colours, and so delicate the drapery of the smaller figures in this assemblage, that an equally interesting specimen of ancient art will rarely be found in England, or on the Continent.\" A particular description of this Church and the painted windows is given in Bigland's History of Gloucester shire.

It was answered me, that they were so many Popes : and one younger man among the rest (Townsend as I perceived afterwards) would take upon him to defend that every diocesan Bishop was Pope. I answered him with some scorn, and obtained leave, that I might with the least loss and defacing of the windows, give order for taking off that offence; which I did by causing the heads of those pictures to be taken off, since I knew the bodies could not offend.\" \u2014 (Hard Measure, ed. 1660, p. 62.)"], [113, "NOTES, 103 CANTO IV.

A continuation of the passage from Bishop Hall's ' Hard Measure' before quoted, as it is the incontestible evidence of a contemporary eye and ear witness, will best serve to give some idea of what Vandals the \"village Hampdens\" of those days were, and of what may always be expected from the brutality of mobs in authority. The Bishop had just spoken of his attempt to save the painted windows by removing the heads of the figures represented. \" There was not,\" he goes on, \"that\" (the same) \" care and moderation used in reforming the Cathedrall Church, bordering upon my palace.

Still yet I remained in my palace, though with but a poor retinue and means : but the house was held too good for me : many messages were sent by Mr. Corbet to remove me thence. The first pretence was, that the Committee, who now was at charge for an house to sit in, might make their dayly session there ; being a place more publick, roomy and chargelesse. The Committee after many consultations resolved it convenient to remove thither, though many overtures and offers were made to the contrary. Mr. Corbet was impatient of my stay there ; and procures and sends peremptory messages for my present dislodging. We desired to have some time allowed for providing some other Mansion, if we must be cast out of this ; which my wife was so willing to hold, that she offered, (if the charge of the present Committee House were the things stood upon) she would be content to defray t\"he summe of the rent of that house of her fifth part : but that might not be yielded : out we must ; and that in three weeks warning by Midsommer day then approaching, so as we might have lyen in the street, for aught I know, had not the providence of God so ordered it, that a neighbour in the Close, one Mr. Gostlin, a widower, was content to void his house for us.\" Having transcribed thus much I must add the concluding little paragraph immediately following in italics. \" This hath been my measure ; wherefore I know not : Lord, thou knowest, who only canst remedy, and end, and forgive or avenge, this horrible oppression.

As it is the object of these Notes, not merely to confirm my own views and opinions by those of other writers of established authority, but to draw the reader's attention to the writers themselves, \u2014 I shall here present him with the words of Dr. Comber on the subject of Church music. Having spoken of the excellence of the Book of Psalms and the great use which the Jews and primitive Christians made of them, \"insomuch that among the latter the very women, the children, and meanest mechanic \" could say them by heart, and sang them at home and abroad, even about their labours, making them at once the exercise of their piety, and the refreshment of their minds,\" and after having recommended a daily attendance in the Churches where they are sung, to become perfect in them and to have holy principles conveyed into our minds with pleasure, he proceeds thus; \"and for this cause I suppose the music to which these sacred songs were first set, is still continued in the Church, (as it was among the Jews and first Christians,) which ought to mind us of the music of the celestial choir; and will calm our souls, and gently raise our affections, putting us into a fit posture to glorify \" our Father which is in heaven,\" and sweetening those pious les sons that will take the deeper root, when the heart is first mollified and prepared to receive them. For sure, he is of a rugged temper and hath an ill-composed soul, who feels not these effects of that grave and pleasant harmony, which doth accompany this office : and we may fear he is not one of David's spirit, whose ears are offended, whose spirit is disturbed, or his devotion hindered by vocal or instrumental music. \u2014 But oh! ye prudent and pious Christians, who bring no prejudices against these things, you know, how oft your souls have been rapt up with extacies of devotion, and your minds filled with ideas of the celestial glory, and your hearts inflamed with strong affections by these sweet strains. Wherefore, do you endeavour, when you are so disposed by the Church music, with fervency and holy ardour to bless the name of God; and be sure you never omit to bear a part yourselves"], [116, "106 NOTES in heart or voice or both ; for so the Church requires ; and so the people of God in all ages have sung their hymns by turns and responses : supposing by this means they might best stir up each other's affections and come nearest to the heavenly pattern, where the Seraphims cry one to another, \" Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts.\" \u2014 Is. vi. 3. (Comber on The Common Prayer, p. 1. \u00a7. 8.) Greatly indeed is it to be desired, that the system of Wilhem, introduced into this country by Hullah, may be the means of establishing in every Village Church, a choir of singers, who may, by the selection of fine old tunes, with subdued intona tion and easy counterpoint, take the lead in devotional psalmody, and thus induce the whole of the congregation to join in this noble, animating, and appropriate employment of the human voice, in our incomparable service. In this instance, as in the responses, standing, and kneeling, I would venture to recommend the Clergyman to avail himself of his 'Sunday School,' as the slow perhaps, but effectual instrument of gaining over his congregation to the general practice. \u2014 As the spiritual reform of a Parish is to be effected only by the educational training of the young, and by their very early incorporation, by habit and instruction, into the body of Christ's Holy Church universal established in this country, so the vigilant and judicious incumbent will find, that in his warfare with veteran abuses, and prejudices and desertions, he can use the children and catechumens by information and enlightened attachment, by conversation and example and natural influence, as his best vanguard in some things, his bodyguard in others, his flugelmen in all. \u2014 Thus \"out of the mouth of babes and suck lings may we find strength ordained, because of our enemies.\" Stanza xvi. These lines were written nearly twenty years ago ; and the author has seen no reason to change the opinion, which he has ever entertained on the subject of pews. That opinion has been as decidedly expressed among his friends, as strongly urged in a more public manner. In the British Magazine he was amongst"], [117, "107 NOTES, the first, if not the first, to draw the attention of the clergy to the subject; and now, he is thankful to say, the public, as well as those, who have the more immediate power of remedying a practice, so injurious to the cause of religion, are earnestly alive to the expediency of gradually substituting open sittings for the exclusive, undevotional, falsely aristocratic, and, we may add unchristian, disfigurement of our Churches by pews.

Swift has touched this trait in the female character with exquisite delicacy, in his poem to Stella visiting him in his sickness. \"with soft and silent tread Unheard she moves about the bed.\" This may serve to modify the assertion of Sir Walter Scott, that Swift never wrote anything pathetic.

On the utility of catechetical instruction, I have already spoken: and it would be endless to cite the testimony of all the great Divines of our Church, upon the same important point. The authority of Seeker, Wake,* Ostervald, Comber, Beveridge and a host of others, can but confirm that which a little reflection will suggest to our own minds. Every Clergyman must feel awfully impressed with the necessity of providing the rising generation, by such means, not only with arms and antidotes against the Dissent, Popery, Socialism, Chartism and Radicalism of the bitter enemies of our Church and Constitution, but with those early principles, and that \" necessary erudition of a Christian man,\" which it is the first duty of the National Church to instil; and which alone can lessen the depravity, the improvidence, the recklessness, in a word the irreligion of the lower classes. To the younger Clergy, if it were at all necessary to urge so vital a part of the ministerial function in every parish, and under the fearful emergency of the times, I should be tempted to do it in the language of the pious and self-reproaching Bishop Hall : \u2014 \" It was the observation of the learnedest king that ever sate hitherto in the English throne, that the cause of the miscarriage of our people into Poperie, and other errours, was their ungroundednesse in the * See the Archbishop's prefatory address to the Archdeacons and Clergy of the Diocese of Lincoln, when he was their Bishop, prefixed to his ' Commentary on the Church Catechism,' for the History of our Catechism."], [119, "109 NOTES, points of Catechisme. How should those souls be but carried about with every wind of doctrine, that are not well ballasted with solid information. Whence it was, that his said late majestie (of happy memory) gave publicke order for bestowing the later part of God's Day in familiar catechizing, then which nothing could be devised more necessary and behovefull to the soules of men. It was the ignorance and ill-disposednesse of some cavillers, that taxed this course as prejudiciall to preachings ; since in truth the most usefull of all preaching is catecheticall. This layes the grounds, the other raiseth the walls and roofe : this informs the judgment, that stirres up the affections. What good use is there of those affections, that runne before the judgment? or of those walls, that want a foundation ? For my part, I have spent the greater halfe of my life in this station of our holy service, I thank God not unpainfully nor unprofitably. But there is no one thing, whereof I repent so much, as not to have bestowed more houres in this publicke exercise of catechisme. In regard whereof I could quarrell with my very Sermons, and wish that a great part of them had been exchanged for this preaching conference. Those other divine dis courses enriche the braine and the tongue : \u2014 this settles the heart. Those others are but the descants to this plaine song. Contemn it not, my brethren, for the easie and noted homelinesse ! The most excellent and beneficiall things are most familiar. What can be more obvious than light and aire, fire and water. Let him that can live without these despise their commonnesse. Rather, as we make so much more use of the divine bounty in these ordinarie benefits, so let us the more gladly improve these readie and facile helpes to the salvation of many soules, the neglect whereof breeds instability of judgment, misprision of necessarie truths, fashionableness of profession, frothinesse of discourse, obnoxiousnesse to all errours and seduction. And if any of our people loathe this manna, because they may gather it from under their feet, let not their palates be humoured in this wanton nauseation. They are worthy to fast, that are wearie of the bread of angels. And if herein we be curious to satisfy their roving appetite, our favours shall be no better than injurious."], [120, "110 NOTES. So we have seen an indiscreet school-master, whiles he affects the thankes of an overweening parent, marre the progress of a froward child, by raising him to an higher forme and authour, ere he have well learned his first rules ; whence followes an empty ostentation and a late disappointment. Our fidelitie and care of profit must teach us to drive at the most sure and universall good, which shall undoubtedly bee best attained by these safe and needfullgroundworkes.\" \u2014 ('The Old Religion.' Epistle DedicatorieJ The same practice is enforced by this excellent Divine and de lightful writer in several other places. In a Sermon, preached in the Green-yard of Norwich on Whitsunday 1644, he says: \"By the way, give me leave to say, that it had been happy for the Church of England in general and this Diocese in particular, that these catechetical Sermons had been more frequent than they have been, as those which are most useful\" &c. &c. Jeremy Taylor urges the same thing with his usual eloquence in many passages. In one he uses the very words of Hall, \" Catechi:ings are our best preachings, and by them we shall give the best accounts of our charges, while in the behalf of Christ, we make disciples, and take prepossession of Infant understandings, and by this holy Rite \" (Confirmation) \" by prayer and imposition of hands, we minister the Holy Spirit to them, and so prevent and disable the artifices of the devil : \"for we are not ignorant of his devices,\" how he enters as soon as he can and taking advantage of their ignorance and their passion seats himself so strongly in their hearts and heads.\" \u2014 \" It is harder to cast the devil out then to keep him out. Hence it is, that the youth are so corrupted in their manners, so devilish in their natures, so curred in their conversation, so disobedient to parents, so wholly given to vanity and idleness : they learn to swear, before they can pray, and to lie, as soon as they can speak.\" \" By this means\" (catechizing,) \"children' (being) ' seasoned with the prin ciples of religion, before malice, self-love, by-ends, or corrupt examples, have depraved their minds and actions, a good foundation would be laid betimes for direction of the course of their whole lives, and the seed of the word would be in them, preserved whole and sound. Men would be better livers and"], [121, "111 NOTES, sounder believers. Horrid vices would not usurp the name of virtues : nor hellish opinions appear vested with the cloak of truth. For, out of question, were the younger sort imbued with the undeniable grounds and clear knowledge of the orthodox re ligion, they could not be so easily carr.ed down the headlong stream of wickedness, nor moved aside by every light puff and wind of doctrine : the Jesuit would not gain so many proselytes, nor the sectary so many light-headed followers.\" \u2014 Bishop Nicholson on the Catechism, \u00a7. 5.

He reproaches parents for not sending their children and servants to such public instruc tions, and for not encouraging them by their own presence. 'On Religious Assemblies.)

Archbishop Bramhall \" craves leave\" to propose as the basis of reconciliation between the Protestant and Romish Churches these three preliminaries. \u2014 \"First, The reduction of the Bishop of Rome from his universality of sovereign jurisdiction, 'jure divino,' to his ' principium unitatis ;' and his court regulated by the canons of the Fathers, which was the sense of the Councils of Constance and Basle, and is desired by many Roman Catholics, as well as ourselves. Secondly, The reduction of the Creed, or necessary points of faith, to what they were in the times of the four first \u0152cumenical Councils, according to the Decree of third General Council ; admitting no additional articles, but only necessary ex-"], [122, "112 NOTES, planations ; and those to be made by the authority of a General Council, or one so general as can be convocated. Thirdly, The removal, if necessary, out of the Divine offices, of some things from whence offences are either given or taken, which, whether right or wrong, do not weigh half so much as the unity of Christians. This, he thinks, would not be refused if animosities were taken away, and charity restored.\" \u2014 Conclusion of \"Just Vindication of the Church of England. Disc. II. With these three concessions, which, he says, \" seem very reasonable demands,\" he asks, \" if Christians might not live in a holy communion, and join in the same public worship of God, free from all schismatical separation of themselves one from another, notwithstanding diver- sities of opinions, which prevail even among the members of the same particular Churches, both with them and us.\" The thoroughly-informed mind, the generous and truly Christian spirit, and the humble reliance on the native force of truth, and on others' love of religious unity, from which this proposed ground- work of reconciliation emanated, are worthy of so great and good a man : and, could the question be entertained upon its own intrinsic and disinterested merits, a lasting peace might be negotiated between the Churches upon so judicious a basis. But, let me ask, in sorrow and despondence, is there now or has there ever been, in the nature and spirit of Popery \u2014 in its unvarying machinery, and unremitted aspirations after universal spiritual dominion by an universal episcopacy, a single display or symptom of this conciliatory disposition ? Could we find amidst the ever active enginery of auricular confession, penances, unctions and absolutions, of the mediating Virgin Mother, and of intercessory saints and priests, who stand towards the deluded and undoubting followers, in the awful characters of justifiers and redeemers, a single 'locus penitenti\u00e6,' one solid standing place of mutual con vention, one ' terra firma' of shore, of jutting eape or coast, on which to throw out the anchor of hope, was there but a hand held out upon authority of amity or even approximation, we might then venture to think we saw before us the prospect, however remote, of an ultimate union with the Romish Church."], [123, ""], [124, ""], [125, ""], [126, ""], [127, ""], [128, ""]]
